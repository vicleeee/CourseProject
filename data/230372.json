Our first problem was finding the hotel, because we when exited the train station out the center door of the train station and looked up and down the street, we must have seen a dozen hotels, but no Savoy. I thought I had read on someone's Trip Advisor post that we should turn left when we exited the station (but that turned out to be the wrong direction.) We tried asking for help in the train station, but no one had heard of the Savoy or could even tell us where the street was located. Since turning left hadn't produced the hotel, we turned around and walked in the other direction, and did finally find the street and the hotel, which is located on a sidestreet and not visible from the front of the train station. We should have gotten off the train, turned right and exited the train station at that end, in which case the hotel would have been visible on our left.Our double room was fine, but our triple room was unpleasant- something stained the walls and the third bed (a couch) had not been made up. We were told that would be done but when we returned from dinner, there were still no blankets or pillow for the couch when we returned hours later, so we were given a single room at no additional charge, which was fair.This might be fine for a traveller who needs close proximity to the train station, but we found nothing redeeming about it otherwise. Certainly wouldn't want to walk around the streets at night.", "Date": "Dec 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR399511759", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "windsor"}, {"Content": "great location, Good Value very close to the train station. easy walk to the sites. nice rooftop pool. clean bathroom.", "Date": "Nov 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR228423816", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jennyhoya"}, {"Content": "Great location, hotel could have been better We stayed in the Savoy in June.

I was shocked upon checkout, when I found a huge bill for the local phone calls I made. I wouldn't have dialed them had I known they would charge me such ghastly amounts!

Breakfast was delicious with the first hot and cold food we had seen for breakfast since we arrived 10 days earlier to the region. Free pasties in the lobby and free drink at the bar. Within walking distance of the Museums on the Main and to Romerburg if you have stamina. All staff were pleasant and helpful. I'd definitely stay here again. Could have used another pillow on the bed though.", "Date": "Mar 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR133264708", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Tarheel006"}, {"Content": "Run Down 3 rd Rate Hotel The Frankfurt Savoy Hotel located downtown 2 blocks away from the main train station 7 or 8 years ago used to be a good hotel [ 4 star ] under different management. I stayed there a couple of times in the past. I picked that hotel because it is close to the train station where the next day I could take the train out to the airport when it is time to return to the U.S.A.  June 28, 2005 I checked in late afternoon and rented 2 rooms for the night. I believe they were on the 3 rd floor, we dropped off our baggage and then went out for a walk and dinner. Returned about 11 P.M. and went to bed. I renember it was very hard and uncomfortable, the next morning I looked at both single beds in the room and found that there were NO MATTRESSES on either bed, only the box spring. The white sink in the bathroom was scratched so badly that the bowl was scratched down to the brown underbase. When we checked out, I asked my cousin to see her room, again neither bed had a mattress and her sink was also scratched totally down to the brown base.  And yet they have 4 stars on their stationary, you would think they would be ashamed I mentioned it at checkout time at the desk, the manager was not there and the employees could have cared less. The rooms were $ 150.00 each. I wrote them, E-Mailed them and faxed them after I returned to the U.S.A. thinking that they might deduct 30 or 40 % from the bill. they never even responded. Visa said that they could do nothing about it. Even the Salvation Army [ Heils Armee ] I am sure has mattresses on their beds.  The Frankfurt Savoy Hotel does not even qualify for a 1 Star Hotel .", "Date": "Jan 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR172534458", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Nice hotel The hotel was fine, not as bad as expected after reading the reviews. It is directly opposite the train station and about 15 mins from the airport by taxi which cost 20 euros each way. The lobby bar is nice as is the restaurant with breakfast. The breakfast was great, there was a very big selection of cereals, breads,  hot items.The rooms were a reasonable size  the bathroom was clean but could perhaps do with a new sink as it was very scratched.Around the hotel is not really any bars, there are a number of kebab shops, a chinese restaurant  several a few adult shops, well it is in the redlight area but we didn't feel unsafe. We went to the Irish bar which was good. We went for the christmas market  it was about a 15 minute walk from the hotel - highly recommed it!Overall the hotel is perhaps more of a 3* but was fine for us.", "Date": "Dec 5, 2005", "ReviewID":
