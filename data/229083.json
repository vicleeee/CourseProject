All in all the hotel was clean, the room was well equiped, the food was alright and the staff was ok. The hotel is located close to the Vatican and it is possible to walk into the city center of Rome but it is a good 45 - 60 minutes. The meeting rooms that we used were fine, nothing fancy but had all the amenities you would expect, including wifi. There did seem to be some power issues as several times over the few days, the power would go but come back on within a minute. The sleeping room was fine - clean bathroom, again wifi worked well, there was a safe in the room as well as ironing facilities. It was possible to turn the heat/air conditioning off which was appreciated. Annoyingly, my room key needed to recharged twice over the course of my stay although I'm not sure why. The breakfast was pretty good with a selection of hot and cold options. My stay here was fine but I would say very average as there was nothing particularly good or bad about the hotel.

Rooms - asked for a double, to be given a twin. Asked to be moved, but new room STUNK of cigarette smoke. Asked for a different room only to be given a double room used as a single (couldn't move round both sides of the bed) which was very dusty and carpet needed a good hoover. I could pick up stuff off the carpet. After going back to reception we were told that they could move us tomorrow. We opted for the twin room as it was the cleanest. The following morning we spoke with reception about moving but it ment us waiting to move and with us having such a short time in Rome, we decided that we would be in our room very little so decided to stay where we were. The hotel is used by a lot of tour companies and cruise lines so is always busy. The noise outside our room often began at 6am as people began to check out or luggage was collected for the tours. The beds were okay, pillows hard and rubbish. We asked for extra ones but they were no better leaving me sleeping without one as this was more comfortable. House keeping was okay, they didn't change the sheets or vacuum the carpet the entire time we were there. The sheets/towels I am okay with but when you can see a carpet or floor needs a quick brush you kinda think it will be done. Basically, once you are there, they just make the bed and refold your towels. Don't expect anything else. The hotel is also VERY warm. We slept with our window's open and AC off as this was the coolest but it is a balancing act between the street noise and the heat. Living on a busy street at home made this a simple choice for us. FOOD: Very little in the area to dine on. Supermarket close to bus stop for bits if you need them. Breakfast in hotel was fine. Service in the bar at night was poor. I waited 15 minutes for service one night and that was after going to reception to ask for someone to serve me. FACILITIES: Gym was tiny and in 3 attempts to get there due to cleaning or technical difficulties it was only open once. Pool was closed but we knew that. LOCATION: horrible location in terms of from the airport. We decided to DIY it without the taxi using buses/metro. Took us 2.5 hours from airport to hotel. Take a Taxi. In terms of getting around each day. Bus stop is a 5 minute walk. Talk the 916 to vatican and down to pantheon etc(every 15 mins). Don't waste your time going to metro. Bus 31 is every half hour to metro so stuck to other bus. Take a good map with you as one hotel gives you stops at the colosseum. Considering this is an NH hotel, It seriously lets the chain down.

Good hotel, in my opinion correctly rated as a 4 star. The rooms were typically Italian with lots of dark wood and a super king sized bed, we also had an additional bed for our son which was a bit of a squeeze but perfectly ok, the bathroom was adequate; fitted out with bidet, shower over bath etc. finished in granite, copious amounts of hot water and good water pressure. Breakfast was good but if you\u2019re expecting a \u2018Full English\u2019 breakfast you will be disappointed. The pool was an absolute God send and was one of the reasons we chose this hotel, there was a large conference taking place at the hotel during our stay and there was a scramble for sun beds on the days the delegates were at the hotel and many people were disappointed (I couldn\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t have more sun beds as there was plenty of room to accommodate them), as soon as they had departed the pool area was deserted for the rest of our stay. Service around the pool was lacking to say the least; to order drinks you went to the pool attendant and waited whilst he got them from a store at the back of the pool and then you took them to where you were seated; not the sort of service you expect when you are paying 4 Euros for a Coca-Cola. The staff were the \u2018down\u2019 side; I left my glasses case on the table at breakfast and returned 5 minutes after I realised what I had done, they denied having seen it! They charged 10 Euros for a Grenadine and Lemonade, the same price as a Gin and Tonic, for those of you who don\u2019t realise Grenadine is a non alcoholic syrup when we expressed our concerns the member of staff was positively rude and we still ended up having to pay 10 Euros for what effectively was equivalent to a orange juice and lemonade. All in all the staff were a miserable bunch which was a real shame because the hotel itself was really very agreeable. The position of the hotel was quite good as far as we were concerned; it was a good 20 minute walk to the Vatican and in the 40\u00b0 heat of August was not something I wished to contemplate. My husband had unfortunately had an accident shortly before we left for Rome which made walking long distances a problem so we decided to hire a car at the last minute. The car was brilliant, plenty of parking at the hotel which is positioned at the top of a fairly big hill not one that I would have fancied walking up after a day of sightseeing. We drove everywhere, my husband has sat.nav. on his mobile phone with all the maps of Europe, we drove to all the main tourist sites, had no problem parking with meters everywhere. Having a car gave us the flexibility to drive to the coast only 30 minutes away and have a day on the beach, we drove to Tivoli, 30 minutes inland and went around the famous gardens \u2013 a really good afternoon and the day we came home we had lunch in Frascati, just 15 minutes from Ciampino airport. We were VERY thankful that we had hired a car as the position of the hotel is not ideal without one. (Please note that it was August and most the residents of Rome leave the city, we don\u2019t know whether it would be quite so easy to park the rest of the year) Overall I would recommend staying here, we had a great week, it made a good place to base ourselves and if we return to Rome in the future we would probably stay here again but not without a car.", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "greece", "Title": "\u201cVery good choice\u201d", "Author": "cult1", "ReviewID": "UR36172504", "Content": "The hotel was excellent.Great big rooms, good location,excellent breakfast.However the stuff was not friendly enough.The reception was far away from the customers.And i saw something i will never forget.In a dinner with spaghetti when we asked for some extra cheese a waitress came over us and pour some in our plates instead of leaving it on our table.And the fact that for 2 straight days ,in a prepaid meal it was served almost the same food was much frustrating.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hollywood, Florida", "Title": "\u201cFriendly, welcoming and accommodating!\u201d", "Author": "pateLio", "ReviewID": "UR34366358", "Content": "Our group of Italian teachers has been here for just about three weeks and we cannot agree more that it is like home.

Well, there was plenty of breakfast and a good varierty, catering for most European tastes but I wouldn't pay the prices for the evening meal. Way too expensive and who wants to eat in the hotel, when you have all of Roma!?! Anyway, I enjoyed my stay and would probably go back. The pool looked fabulous but we never got the chance to go in as it didn't open until 10:00 and was off-limits by the time we returned from sight-seeing in the evening (basically after 19:00 - but maybe the timeframe is seasonal?). Hey-ho, just something you might want to consider if a pool is a must-have - this was one of my reasons for booking the NH; the thought of an invigorating swim in the morning or a cool dip post tourist-day. So, getting there / out & about. Loads of buses into town unless of course it's belting down like it did on our first day and you have to get a taxi to Piazza San Pietro ... and get ripped off ... lol. Because we got into Ciampino late-on, we jumped on the Terravision bus to Stazione Termini then got a taxi to the hotel - get the bus tickets from the vendor outside of the airport, they're cheaper and a return is best. You won't miss the \"touts\" waiting for you. Alternatively, if your cost-cutting get the Metropolitana - either from Anagnina (nearest Metro to the airport) or Termini to Cornelia, then jump on buses: 916, 791, 190, 98, 46/ or C6 a few stops down to Via Gregorio VIII and get off at McDonalds! Similarly, going into town there's a host of buses near to the McDonald's stop but you may want to download a map or buy one for EUR2.50, it helps. You can walk to Piazza San Pietro - weather permitting - we used this as our starting point and walked most places from there. The Metro is easy to use though but get a pass - 3 days was EUR11 I think and can be used on the buses too. I tried 3 tobacconist's but they'd ran out of the 3 day one's so I just got ours from the machines in the stations. Where was I? Oh yes, McDonald's. I didn't have a detailed map at first so if you are on Via Gregorio VIII with McDonald's to your right, head up to the corner towards another main road - keeping to the left (I think there's a Renault-Nissan showroom on the left) then take this left. Continue a little further on, past the petrol station on your right and do another left. You should see the hotel entrance / drive on the right over the road.

On that small street there are several great restaurants and another supermarket. We usually ate at least one meal daily of sandwiches and fruit and snacks we purchased and ate in the room. Cheap and tastey. Best restaurants in the area were the Siciliana for ice cream and desserts, Risky Point, a neighborhood bar/restaurant with great pizza and also found a great little family run restaurant next to a butcher shop in the area that had a very atmospheric back dining area and a nice menu with hearty, well prepared meals. Highly recommended for dinner and much better than anything we found in the touristy areas. There is also a bus stop a bit further down from the McDonalds that will take you past the Vatican and go all the way to the Colosseum. We took the bus 571 (the hotel has local maps with that information), every day and found it worked really well to get to all the sights and travel into the old city. The busses do stop early though. It seemed like no matter where we were in Rome a cab back to the hotel would cost between 8 and 12 Euros, not that bad. All the tourist attractions seemed to be about a 6 to 10 block walk from each other so despite the high heat of July it was easy to cram in lots of sightseeing on foot. We did it on our own, The tour bus people following guides around didn't seem to be having much fun and were hoofing it anyway, we just saved the expense. The hotel pool was nice. Water felt cool even on scorching hot days. Good quality lounge chairs (but not enough of them), food and drink service, and lots of sun umbrellas. Great spending afternoons there. Housekeeping staff were thorough, changed and refilled everything as needed. Towel change was optional but they had no problem doing it. Personally I don't mid re-using a towel. The Cons: The hotel is a couple of miles from most of the sights. The only thing in walking distance was the vatican and nearby areas. The front desk people weren't especially knowledgeable or friendly. The hotel was wired and Internet available, but if you used their computers it cost $10 Euros an hour, and they used some unliscensed software for browsing that would freeze the system for 30 seconds with a message to register the program every five minutes. Very annoying at those exorbitant prices. Also had some extra phone calls on the final bill. It irks me when I get stuck paying for the maids personal calls at a hotel (not the first time), even if it is just a dollar or two on the bill. The checkout staff wouldn't budge on the phone calls though.

The selection was made as a bargain choice on Last Minute.com. One important factor that influenced choice was the hotel pool which certainly lived up to expectations and was essential for relaxation after touring the sites in the high temperatures of August in Rome. The staff were friendly and helpful although the suggestion that a walk to St Peters was about 15 minutes must have been with a strong following wind and definitely not with 2 children in tow! Street maps and additional written directions for specific bus routes were provided on request. The main attractions and sites could all be reached within 10-20 minutes by bus (and Metro). Rooms were clean and well-serviced although the a/c was a bit noisy. The breakfast was the only meal we had in the hotel and was pretty much consistent with a traditional European-type buffet. A buffet lunch on the terrace was also available (for 14 Euros) although the restaurant seemed to be only sparsely populated apart from at breakfast; no doubt because of the vast array of options for eating in Rome. There were shops within a 5-minute walk from the hotel and these included a supermarket and an excellent, small pizzeria that was open most hours of the day and night and where any amount of pizza could be purchased at very reasonable prices. There is also a McDonalds close by for those who simply are unable to 'do without'. A few minutes' walk down the road towards the City is the Restaurant Del Sardo which at a glance appears to be nothing too special but the staff were friendly and the food certainly compared more than favourably with many restaurants in the City. A small tip also secured a splendid 2007 Pope calender with 12 seasonal pictures of PBXV1including a festive appearance in a Santa's hat; try looking at that and keeping a straight face! Bus tickets (that must be purchased before boarding public transport) could be obtained from the newsagent/tobacco shop (Tabacchi) near the hotel which, according to the sign on the door, is open between 08.00-13.00 and then 16.00-19.30.

Drinks at the bar are expensive! Pina Colada is about 11 euros. Pot of tea is about 6 euros. However the bar staff are friendly and courteous.

I have to warn you that its quite a steep climb up the driveway to the hotel reception! 2. You can get into the city centre quite easily by getting the 571 bus which also goes past the Vatican. The 571 bus will drop you right outside the Colossium. We preferred to get the 31 bus and take the metro from Cipro. Also be warned that the metro closes at 9am so learn your bus routes! 3. You can walk to the Vatican which takes about 30 mins but I would advise to either take the bus or the metro as the stop outside and when you wlak its hard to find the entrance. Ok, now the hotel, The rooms were small but comfortable and housekeeping service was excellent. We asked for a double room but once we got inside the bed was tiny. We were told it was a matrimonial bed but they were more than willing to give us a room with 2 singles beds pushed together. Breakfast is ok, avoid the fresh juices as they taste very watered down. Also they dont really make it obvious that they serve fresh cappachino's, you have to ask for them. Try and go down early aswell as we went went down at 8am and most of the food had finished and they don't refill it. Apart from that no complaints about the hotel, had a lovely stay, the pool is definately a plus point as it gets really hot in the afternoons so its nice to relax by the pool.

Reception was excellent..nothing too much trouble, all spoke excellent English. Hotel was a typical large 4* hotel with a somewhat business feel to it rather than a family hotel. It is located in a relatively quiet and residential area of Rome which was nice, approx 1 mile from the Vatican which was no problem to walk. The rooms and bathrooms were very clean, the breakfasts were very good with an excellent hot and cold buffe,t however the evening meals were not wonderful with a fairly restricted choice. The bar staff were not very friendly as it would appear that unless you were Italian the little extras were not provided. eg.. we bought a bottle of wine and two cokes which came to well over 20 Euro. An Italian resident came in shortly after us and ordered a small beer and was presented with a huge bowl of complimentary crisps!!! charming!! Overall I would reccomend this hotel. I would suggest you fill yourself up at breakfast and you could get through the day until evening with fruit and water (local market very good on the walk from the hotel into town) also there are so many places to eat in town that you just have to eat in one of them. The atmosphere in the side streets around the Vatican is wonderful and you could easily sit with a drink and just 'people watch' for hours. Taxis are very cheap but just make sure you get the hotel name written on a piece of paper as one or two taxis like to 'misunderstand' the hotel name and charge off in the wrong direction. Also, walk into town (as it is down hill and cooler in the morning) and get a taxi back!! Finally, this hotel is very nice, not too expensive and is worth the stay for those little extras you get in 4* hotels...it is also fully air conditioned...heaven on a hot day, and it can get very hot in Rome.

This hotel is within a 15 minute walk from the vatican in a residential neighborhood. Considering it was high season, I was paying about 110 euros/night. A similar nice hotel downtown would have easily been over 200 euro. Even by taxi, you could be in downtown within 10-15 minutes for 10 euro. One can easily do the math and see it is a good deal. The key factor about this hotel is that it was modern. The AC was great. The rooms were not musty. The breakfast buffet was very tasty. A closeby hotel is the Crowne Plaza which is more worn and old and certainly does not compare in quality.

The hotel is a pleasant modern fully air-conditioned building, about 5 years old, located 20 minutes walk from the Vatican, using Via Gregorio VII. The walk, whilst easy, does involve negotiating the Rome traffic at several crossing points which is definitely not for the faint hearted! The centre of the city (Piazza Venezia) is reached by catching the number 916 bus (1 euro for a single ticket) from Piazza Pio XI which is about 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The hotel is located in a pleasant residential suburb which has a real neighbourhood feel with a good range of shops and facilities. Being out of the immediate centre of Rome was never a problem and it was good to spend the mornings sightseeing and return to the hotel later on in the afternoon. For reasonable cost dining, of particular note was the excellent Tavola Calda and Rosticceria called \u2018Delizie del Palato\u2019 at the junction of Via Gregorio VII and Via S. Damaso, 10 minutes walk towards the Vatican from the hotel. This was well patronised by locals. The hotel breakfasts were excellent, with a wide selection of cooked and cold foods. It did pay to be down to breakfast fairly early, however as some of the cooked food did run a little low after about 8.30am. The staff were efficient and helpful, and the very well tended pool was excellent for cooling down after a hot morning\u2019s sight seeing (some days temperature was around 32 centigrade). Would I stay there again? Most certainly \u2013 although slightly out of the way, this is a pleasant well run hotel with helpful staff and an excellent breakfast. With more moderate restaurant prices and slightly better facilities it could be outstanding. For example we didn\u2019t use the hotel restaurant for evening meals, as it was way too expensive (33 euros a head for a three course meal). The same for the mini bar in the rooms with small cans of beer costing 5 euros. Instead we made up picnic lunches from the PAM supermarket on Piazza Pio XI. The hotel rooms were quite small, and there were no tea or coffee making facilities. The in house laundry service was also too expensive and the hotel could have done with a laundry room.", "Date": "August 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Great Pool\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3763152", "Content": "Stayed here in August 2005.

The rooms were a bit small, with NO IRONS (bad for this poor packer), little dresser space, but great bathrooms and a nice TV (no alarm clocks, either). The hotel, in and of itself, was great. However, the hotel is a bit of a distance from central Rome. It's an easy 30-45 minute walk to Vatican City, and quite a hike to anywhere in the Ancient City. There is a bus right out front (woohoo #31) which will take you to the Metro or the Tram #8, which is great to downtown. I didn't mind the adventure (a weeklong Metro/bus/tram pass is 16 Euro - and worth it!), but it was a little taxing on my grandparents in their late 60s.

We were travelling with a tour group; Rome and the Jolly Hotel Carpegna was the beginning of my 10 day tour. After 25 hours of travelling I was looking forward to taking a nap and getting cleaned up before our welcome dinner that evening. At 11am the porter brought one of our suitcases from the bus but we were still missing one, which I informed him of at that time. 2 hours later he had not returned so I went to the front desk and was told that they would check into it for me and call me at the room. I waited another 1.5 hours without response before following up at the desk, this time the clerk told me that he was waiting on a call from the airline...I again informed him of the situation and that my bag was not at the airport but somewhere in the hotel. He then said that he would have the porter check the luggage holding room and would let me know. I sat in front of the luggage room for 1 hour and not one person checked ANYWHERE for my suitcase! When I approached him again I was told that it was probably delivered in the wrong room and that it was going to take some time to find it. Still, nobody moved in any effort to look for it. Finally, at 5 o'clock our tour director arrived back at the hotel and I informed him of the situation. Within 2 minutes of him addressing the staff they were all over the hotel searching! I waited 6 hours and not one person lifted a finger! The luggage was found outside the wrong room which was 2 doors down from ours. Those people must have just returned to their room and just set it outside the door because I had walked that corridor all day. The only comment I got from anyone at the hotel was \"I cannot believe you didnt see your luggage sitting there...it was only 2 doors away from yours!\" This didnt sound like an apology to me since I now had no time to get cleaned up before dinner.
