The breakfast is clearly a highlight (they even have fresh orange, when the machine isn't broken like today). For once you want to ask for a street side room as the back side faces a rail tracks with trains running 24x7 (noisy, even from the top floors). The (single) beds could be a bit larger.What's really wrong with all these hotels in the area is that the price multiples by at least 3 or 5 when there's a fair in FRA...", "Date": "May 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR685243596", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "nico_ch"}, {"Content": "Perfect for the Christmas markets Stayed here for a weekend break to see Frankfurt and also visit the Xmas markets. Great hotel located within a short walk of Niederrad train station, Trains were never a problem and always on time, and for a family day card for 5 it was just under 6 euro. The hotel was easy to find, and the outside area was kept clean and tidy, the Lobby was again very good, with seating as you walked in, Reception were very quick and efficient and gave us lots of info when we asked for it, check in was very quick. You took a lift to get up to your room.The rooms were of a very good standard, bright and airy, nice seperate bedroom/living area where myself my Husband and Son stayed. My Son had the pull out bed in the living area, the pull out bed wasn't the most comfy and there could have been an extra duvet. But apart from that it did the job. There were Tea/Coffee making facilities in the room and also a mini bar, there was also a Television and plenty of storage space for clothes.In the seperate bedroom there was a lovely comfy kingsized bed again with a seperate Television and also good storage space. The only gripe we had was the X-Rated preview as you scrolled through the channels, almost resulted in highly embarrassing moments on a few occasions. Also the pillows were terrible and could have been filled with more feathers.The bathroom was fine again lots of storage, it had a bath/shower although the water from the shower came out almost as fast as a Firemans pressure hose, worked wonders for massaging your butt! They could have done with providing dressing gowns as an added touch, especially useful to go down to the Pool area.Our two Daughters had their own seperate twin room, again the same layout as our room, we didn't realise til after we got there we could have booked a superior room for a few extra Euros for all 5 of us, so if you have more than 4 in your family it may be wise to enquire about this, and its something we will book if we return to this hotel.This Hotel had an added bonus of Swimming pool, Turkish footbath, Steam room, Sauna, Massage, Solarium and also great for the kids Table Football! Our kids loved this and spent most of our evenings down there. But as I mentioned before the use of dressing gowns would have been good for the Pool area.Myself and my Husband didn't have Breakfast as extra we found it to be too expensive for what it was, but our 3 children had free Breakfast each day and this was included in the price, perfect for hungry tummies. It wasn't until the 2nd morning that we realised we could actually have free breakfast in the lobby, we went down to locate it and eventually found it tucked behind an area next to the Stairs and Reception. We enjoyed Croissants, Tea/Coffee nice little touch but would have been better if we had found it the day before.For food hubby found a great Chinese and Pizza/Chip shop close to the Supermarket Aldi, we enjoyed lovely take away food from here on two occasions, Aldi was great to stock up on Beer, treats etc, you go out of the Hotel turn left walk to the crossing turn right, Cross the road opposite the Flower shop and carry on walking it's past the Police station on the Left.All in all a fantastic hotel, great price, location was not a problem, very friendly helpful staff and would 100% come back here to stay again.", "Date": "Feb 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR612551433", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "theloveisback"}, {"Content": "Dorint Niederrad in Frankfurt, Easily a 5 Star hotel This non-touristy hotel is tucked in a quiet business residential area in Niederrad. We would rate it easily as a 5 star hotel, even though it is rated 4-star. The staff is extremely courteous, and very helpful. As you enter, the lobby is impeccably clean, the floor has black tiles you would want to take pictures of. The rooms are impeccable, down comforters and pillows are as clean as they get. The restaurant offered a breakfast and lunch buffet which was excellent. You will find it difficult to get this quality dining experience elsewhere in Frankfurt, unless you spend upward of 50-75 euros per person. The swimming pool, sauna and steam room were first class european. In short, we could not have asked for a better place. Since we went in November, we paid peanuts for the room rate.", "Date": "Dec 7, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR651800456", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Well it's Frankfurst I have practically lived at this hotel while working in the nearby business park.
