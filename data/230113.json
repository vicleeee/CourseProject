I was visiting over Easter weekend and while the price for my 3 night stay was ludicrously high (200 per night), I let my desire for a nice, safe location make the price seem fair. While the location did live up to expectation and the hotel was relatively nice. 600 was far too steep for what I got in return. The room itself was find. A standard hotel room really. Albeit with a very expensive minibar. The beds were comfortable enough. I didn't partake in any meals during my stay but the staff were very kind on check in and out. The real dampner to my stay here happened after I left Amsterdam and returned home. I checked my bank account online a few days later to see that I had been left penniless. I called my bank straight away and they told me there was more than one transaction by Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre. After much correspondence with the hotel, they admitted to authorizing my card for 240 euro and then also 416.36 and also charging the 600 for my actual stay. At first the claimed to only have put 240 on authorization but my bank was able to confirm for me that this was not the case. I'm still waiting to get my money back from them even though they've claimed to have cancelled the authorisations. This could take 10 working days for the bank to process. I've been forced to alter plans and my life based on the fact that the hotel robbed me. Yes, robbed. While their staff have been relatively helpful in trying to return the stolen money to me, it's not good enough. I was not offered any compensation nor any sincere apology (nothing above \"sorry for the inconvenience\" - inconvenience being the understatement of the century here). This sort of occurrence shouldn't have happened in the first place. To be honest, the whole drama has left me with nothing but bad feelings about this hotel and my trip to Amsterdam.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent, easy stay\u201d", "Author": "Fionamaryadvises", "ReviewID": "UR128026620", "Content": "Fantastic location within walking distance of Central Station.

Otherwise the rooms are adequate and comfortable. The beds were firm and the comforters warm and cozy. We paid for a booking deal that included the buffet breakfast. It is a great spread.....with a wonderful coffee machine that makes everything from espresso to lattes, and a full on breakfast with a fresh orange juice press, eggs, sausages, all sorts of breads...the works! If you are not a big breakfast person it's not worth it to pay for the breakfast, and you can go right to the corner for fabulous lattes and pastries. We went to Humphrey's restaurant right next door for a glass of wine, but they wouldn't allow us to sit at the bar! Seems they stipulate you can only eat dinner there. We found that odd, so we went to a nice little bar/restaurant up the street.

I'm going to share the other couple's review of the hotel since i have it written in my travel journal: \"The hotel looked pretty fancy from the outside and I was surprised to find the inside fancy as well. The front desk people were nice and friendly. I liked the fact that there were 2 computers in the lobby that you can use for free for 30 minutes. to get to our room, we had to go to the 2nd floor and then walk to the other attachment of the building then go to the 3rd floor. our room was really nice. 2 beds were pushed together. the washrooms were nicer than i expected. I liked the fact there was a safe. a minibar was also available and a few snacks.\" I was impressed with the size of the room. The bed was extremely comfortable. There was a huge closet for clothes and a nice sitting area. There was plenty of room for luggage. I loved the bath tub. I took a lovely bubble bath one of the evenings. It was so relaxing. The bathroom was a good size. I like the travel size samples that the hotel provides. The snacks included in the minibar were Stroopwafels. The brand they had was Daelmans Mini Stroopwafels. I ended up buying them at a shop nearby with the intention to bring it back as a souvenir but I ended up eating them. They are delicious!! too bad they dont sell them in Canada, so I suggest you get your fill of them while in Amsterdam. A lot of people complain about the images of the people in their rooms and scattered around the hotel, but I had a lot of fun with them. We would try to guess what the situation was and what these people would say or think. We didn't try the breakfast because of the price, I highly suggest you have your breakfast at the Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs. OMG I will never look at pancakes the same way ever. It was the best pancakes I've ever had in my life. I crave these pancakes and wish I could get something like this in Toronto. Upon checkout, we had to pay additional taxes. We paid in cash and were given a receipt. I would definitely stay here again. I miss Amsterdam. While I was standing outside waiting for the rain to stop, a gentleman came out of the hotel telling me how happy he was that he was able to get a room at such a good rate.

With the location being central and the hotel pictures looking relatively nice we decided to book this hotel. This is where the pleasantries end - never in my life have I experienced such inept customer service which to be honest borders on downright disgraceful! I reserved the room with my card details and as I understood the room had been paid for in advance. This was also confirmed to me on checkout by the hotel staff when again they had my card details and told me that the rooms had been paid for. So you can imagine that it came as quite a surprise when the hotel thought it was acceptable to take \u00c2\u00a3526 out of my SISTER'S BOYFRIEND'S account 6 weeks after we had returned home (bearing in mind they only took his card details to cover sundries used in the hotel room. Now I've been to a few hotels in my time and the last time I checked peanuts were not that expensive!) I contacted the hotel immediately to query this as having thought the room had been paid for and not been told otherwise by the hotel staff, I assumed it must have been a mistake. I was then given a half hearted excuse with the standard \"accounting error\" being the cause. I then asked why they had taken it from my sister's boyfriends account as he had not made the reservation and they told me they were the only card details they could find. I then asked them to refund his card and they told me that I could set up a payment plan to just pay him seeing as he was my sister's boyfriend. Bearing in mind this had taken his account overdrawn and he needed the money asap. As it was their mistake I suggested that they come up with a more suitable compromise as obviously \u00c2\u00a3526 is a lot of money to have at your fingertips when you think it has already been paid. They told me they would refund my sister's boyfriend and then charge my card for half of the amount which I felt was fair and more affordable given the big mistake they had made. I agreed to this and passed on my card details again. However I have since found out that they have only refunded my sister's boyfriend for half the amount and still charged me for half. When I got in touch again with the hotel they decided it was in the interest of good customer service to just totally ignore my emails. Needless to stay the overall experience of this hotel has soured what was an enjoyable stay. The final kick in the teeth was that the \"surprise\" at the hotel was a naff pair of flip flops. The last time I checked Amsterdam isn't exactly spoilt for choice when it comes to beaches and the hotel doesn't even have a pool!

London, Liverpool, Amsterdam & Pairs. Our hotel in Amsterdam ended up 4th in our overall hotel rating. It was the most expensive, with the least to offer. The room was small, but ended up being manageable. Our \"view\" was of the air conditioning units (and I was promised a room with a view) and being left-handed caused me pain! The doorknob is such that when shut with the left hand (I finally learned after bruising my hand and almost destroying my wedding ring) it catches your hand between the knob and a very heavy steel door jam. OUCH! I did approach the front desk with email in hand that promised me a larger room and view, but they were not friendly or accommodating. I was told in very plain English, that that is ALL that was available. Their way of handling it left a sour taste in my mouth. I am trying to be objective with my review, but really glad we were only staying two nights. The beds were extremely comfortable and that is a top priority of mine. The bathroom was nicely appointed too. The lobby and bar are beautifully decorated, though my grandson thought the \"portraits\" in the hallways and elevators a little odd. It is a modern, contemporary property and I thought it was very nice. The FREE Wi Fi worked very well. We did not partake of the restaurant or breakfast. There are far too many places to eat within steps of the hotel. Amsterdam is expensive-so be prepared. Would I stay here again-probably not. I would like a quieter location on a canal away from the seediness of the area. It is a short walk to the red-light district and Dam Square. It is conveniently located for getting around. Took us 5 minutes with luggage to walk to/from the Amsterdam Centraal train station. This hotel is in the middle of the \"coffee shops\" and if one wanders just down the little street it is located on, one might just get a \"contact high\" from the smoke in the air!

So, I have already called my bank to dispute the charge once the Euros 120 is taken from my card and will be calling the hotel in the morning!!

Luckily I checked my internet banking today and luckily I did keep that hotel receipt when i checked. Very sneaky!! Why didn't they inform me of the extra charge or have it showing n the bill at check out!?! Dodgy.

Shocking! I wasn't going to write on here; couldn't be bothered, despite my complaints, but seeing the charge prompted me to warn others. I note from calling my bank that the pending charge was made on he day we checked in, so this tells me she had charged my credit card there and then. So why isn't it on my check out bill. SNEAKY!!!

Having said that though, the room was clean, fresh and well maintained. The hotel looks as if it was recently renovated. The hotel is 5 minutes walk from the station and walking distance to most parts of the city centre. There are plenty of places to eat and drink all around the hotel. Amsterdam is a real buzz and we had a great time. A couple of doors from the hotel is a little cafe specialising in great coffee. The owner, a very charming barista, is passionate about coffee and we had the best coffee of our 6 week trip at his place. Sad that we found him on the morning we were leaving.

Also, the closeness to City Center, RLD, Damrak, Shopping, Restaurants is a very big plus. The housekeeping staff are very friendly when you see them in the halls. The rooms are spotlessly clean. Bed and linens are extremely comfortable. Good hot water, AC/Heat worked perfectly. The Bar is nice and relaxing in the evening to sit and have a Heineken and catch up on emails with the strong wifi signal. Bartender remembered what I ordered only after one visit the next night, nice. The concierge was friendly and helpful. The decor is modern and different, but I liked it. The room was incredibly quiet for being in the City Center. Getting a Taxi to the airport from the hotel is cheaper than flagging one down, you buy a voucher for 42 Euros from the front desk then they call and 5 minutes you have a Taxi. The Not So Good: The elevator situation is a little weird if they put you in a room in the back of the hotel, actually another building. You go up 2 floors on one elevator, get off and go down a long hall to another elevator to go up to your floor. With that said, the elevators are fast and you don't wait more than a few seconds. Hotel advertises Free Wifi in every Room, not true, being in the back the signal is weak and if you can actually get on you won't have a signal long, minutes at most, I'd say 90% of the time I tried to use it in my room there no signal. Very frustrating since I booked this hotel over another hotel like it because of the Free Wifi as I needed to keep up with work emails daily. Complaining at Front Desk will get you nowhere, they don't care. Re: Front Desk Staff, some are grumpy and unhelpful especially at night, not all, most.

If I wanted my room cleaned don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you think I would have hung the side that said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Please Clean My Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? Maybe they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to read I guess.

They still called. Upon checking out they tried to charge me for 7 days of breakfast which I never had breakfast one day there. She started to argue with me and said it says here you did, I said I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even eat breakfast kinda irritated and she quickly said there must be a problem with our computer, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take it off.

The en suite bathroom was fine and, most importantly, clean, although I'm not sure how much I'd agree with the hotel's description of 'luxury'. It does have a bath with a good shower, but it is a touch small and the decor and hairdyer is only basic. It did have nice toiletries: the usuals, plus a basic beauty kit and bath chrystals.

It's a fairly standard international tourist hotel - everything was clean and well looked after, but there is a complete absence of local character (well, any character at all!). Our \"superior\" double room was comfortable, level of equipment was ok without being luxurious. Our main complaint about the room is the level of lighting - the only place you will have enough light to read something is in the bathroom! The only food served is breakfast, which is an uncontroversial international buffet. It's ok, and obviously convenient, but expensive at EUR15. There's no benefit to buying it in advance, so you might as well avoid paying up front and just go if and when you feel like it. Handy for your first morning, perhaps - but once you have found your way around you will find more choices and better value just around the corner. The location was ok - 5+ minutes walk from Centraal station - but unless you plan to spend most of your time in the red light district it may not be the best. Every time we went somewhere we had to start by getting a tram (stop very close by) - it might have been better to have been a little further South. As has been noted there is wifi - but at least in our room the connection quality was poor - not good enough to play a YouTube stream, for example. Someone else commented on grumpy reception staff: this appears to be the luck of the draw, as we had a a grumpy one when we arrived and a much friendlier one when we left!

We showed her the recipit and she told us our room numbers We had our 14 month little girl with us and the hotel supplied us with a cot. So with the cot and buggy in the room made it feel very small and not much room for her to move around . The lounge bar was lovely with big open fire but it did not open till 4 and on our 2nd night we came back for a drink and my husband was charged 26 euro for 4 drinks a bit steep we thought he went back to the bar and asked her to check it and she told him it was right.. The real bar man came back on and we asked him when he came ober to see if we where ok he checked the price of the round and refunded the 8euro difference and a really really nice bloke he also checked our Room number and it turned out the other girl had also charged our room as well as over charged us. The bar man was so nice we did not bring it up at check out. On Wednesday morning the Tv came on while we where in bed and at about 8.30 am and woke my little one up. Asking me to contact reception that there was a problem with my credit card I rang reception and she told me the card had failed I told herctge room was paid . She told me she would get back to me.. I got up and brought the recepit down to reception ( as I had been shopping while there) again I had to prove we had paid and she said we owed her 50 euro deposit but she had been trying to put the full room price and the 50euro through. Sorted again I thought on check out again I was told I owed 100euro I again had to pull out all the recepits. And it turned out they owed me 47euro and the other 50 euro to my credit card. Found it all a bit stressful. The very nice man on reception said it was because of the way the booking was done on easy to book.com and it was all sorted but 4 times at reception and 1 time at the bar to be worried about been over charged lucky I stayed out of the coffee shops and had my recepits", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterford, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNo regard for their customers!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "studentcity_10", "ReviewID": "UR90476132", "Content": "on 17th December last Amsterdam closed its airport due to snow (not our fault). 10 of us (all working for a travel company in southern Ireland) were booked into the Inntel Amsterdam Hotel.

We did sleep with the window cracked since the down made it a bit warm. We had a brief squabble with the safe, but someone was there to help us in a flash and it opened as they knocked on the door. Great service over all. The only down side of the hotel was the computer situation in the lounge, as the connection was slow - even slower than the free wifi - so printing out our boarding passes took some doing, but we waited it out. The decor was pleasant, though inconsistent from the lobby to the hallways to the room - as the first and last were contemporary and the second - well, it was more reminiscent of a Marriot than a W, but it hardly mattered. This hotel puts you in a great spot to explore the city center and beyond, since you're right on the tram line, in walking distance from the Central train station and close to any and all of the Amsterdam sights you might want to visit. If you're planning a trip to the Anne Frank Museum, first make a reservation online (saves HOURS in queuing) and then visit the Resistance Museum (near the zoo and botanical gardens) before going.

For dinner, we loved Kop Van Jut (Head of Jut) for good old Amsterdam/Holland fare and their home brew, which was quite good. The NoorMarkt (sp?) was also a good find for trinkets and food and the Flower Market for gifts and just general amusement. Beautiful.

We paid an average of $215 a night. The walls were white with one greenish-blue wall behind the bed and the bedding was a plain white duvet over a thick down comforter. The curtains were a rubberized blackout material with a blue/green print. There was one picture on the wall. We were at the front of the hotel so there was some street noise but because the windows are double-paned, it was not a problem. The newly-renovated bathroom was perfect for one, tight for two, with tile flooring, a tub and a partial-glass-door on it that did little to keep the shower from splashing the entire bathroom. We had a big Grohe rainshower but because there was virtually no water pressure, it was tough to shower and even more difficult to wash hair. I ended up attaching the hand shower and using that. The door could not open all the way into the bathroom because it bumped against the tub. Small vials of shampoo, shower gel and lotion were provided, apparently not the case in all the rooms. Hardly worth the extra expense, though. We did like having the bigger bed instead of two twins.... We did not have the breakfast buffet because there were so many cafes and restaurants nearby that were much less expensive. There's a wonderful coffee place on the corner called Coffee Connection run by Dave who is a true coffee fan. His espressos are to die for and the cappuccinos (with hearts or leaves in the foam) are made with half and half and are bigger than standard cappuccinos and truly delightful. He also makes great paninis and \"tostis\" which are great for breakfast. The staff at the hotel were all friendly and helpful and really good English-speakers and were always willing to help with directions and suggestions. They provided a reasonable map, but you need a much better one (buy at the train station or a bookstore) that has the names of many more streets so that getting lost is not a problem. The biggest issue we had is that it was warm (about 80degrees) and the air conditioning even set at its coldest could not keep the room comfortably cool. With the heavy duvet/comforter, we absolutely were too hot at night. We asked for a lightweight blanket but all they could provide was a sheet. It has become clear to me that most of the hotels we stayed at had the same problem with a/c. Maybe it's too expensive to calibrate so that the people in each room can actually determine their own comfortable temperature? No matter where we were, we couldn't get the temps below 21 degrees centigrade, really too hot at night. And, in most places, the windows didn't open. In this hotel, because we were on the street, we didn't want to open the window because there was too much noise from the hotels and bars just below. Next time I'd prefer a hotel with a little more personality, but the location of this one was absolutely fantastic- right on a tram line and close to everything, including a five minute walk to the train station. Transportation in Amsterdam is a breeze and walking is easy to everything. Wi Fi was included at no extra charge but the connection was not speedy.

I would definitely recommend the Golden Tulip in Amsterdam Centre. For a start, its proximity to the train station made our cheap transfer from the airport super easy. We found the hotel really easily (just cross the bridge to the right of the station, cross the tram lines and keep walking, the hotel is on a pedestrian area on the left, second building in, the building on the corner is a glassy structure). The staff were courteous and helpful and room was warm, clean and had everything we need. Of course, this is a chain hotel, there is no 'experience' staying here, no dutch touches which make it memorable or amazing views, but after pounding the cobblestones in snow and sub zero temperatures we found it a pleasant room to relax in, very cosy and warm so we thawed out well! The fact that we could also make a cup of tea in our room was a definite plus and the free WiFI was great and very fast. We didn't eat in the breakfast restaurant or drink in the bar - there are a multitude of cafes, bars and restaurants nearby so why bother? I can also recommend the restaurant directly next door that do a set three course meal for 22.50 euros per head. Delicious food.

Room and bathroom, despite being clean, are cramped. If you think 4-star hotels you think of good spaces, huge fluffy towels, nice complimentary toiletries and good fitting throughout.

Ladies, bring your own shampoo, conditioner and body lotion if you have sensitive skin - I had to go and buy some emergency ones in the shops after coming out of the shower with a dry wig instead of my usual hair.

A local tram and bus service run from outside the door, they are very cheap, run regular and the staff are very helpful when it comes to finding your way around. I definitely recommend this hotel for your stay in Amsterdam. My top tip would actually be to use the trains to get to and from Schipol airport for central Amsterdam, not the shuttle bus or taxi they are far more expensive.

Having booked at one price, we found ourselves charged another - and it's taking some time to manage the dispute. Without warning, 10 days after our departure, the hotel randomly added a figure of 300 euros to my Visa account. The rooms were barely larger than the average low-budget Ibis, while a plastic bottle that I noticed under the bed on the day we arrived remained there until (and presumably after) we checked out. Generally, the room was uninspiring - the bathroom was clean, though the towels could have been of better quality. The hotel is overpriced in general - standard rate for standard rooms (I'm sure our room couldn't have been graded any higher than that) being at over 140 euros - rising, we were told, to over 400 euros at times of peak demand (which I would consider the equivalent to highway robbery). The breakfast - though decent enough - certainly hadn't the variety and quality to justify its rather exorbitant price of over 16 euros. The staff were in general OK - but that is all that saved this hotel from receiving a rating of \"terrible\" after our experiences with them.

We took a train from the airport to Central Station and the hotel was pretty easy to find from there. We walked with our suitcases, which was a challenge with all the people on the street and bike riders, but wasn't a bad walk overall - pretty much a straight shot to the hotel. Don't bother with taking a taxi, it's a quick trip. We checked in with no problem and when we got to the room, we thought it was nice. The rooms are small, but all European hotel rooms are pretty small so this one was average. The bed was comfortable and the room was kept clean so we were happy. The blowdryer was interesting and didn't work all that well so I kept my hair in a ponytail for the few days we stayed there! There was also a safe in the room, which was helpful. As with most of the reviews I've read on this hotel, we passed on the breakfast because it was expensive by comparison to some nearby restaurants and little cafes. The hotel was in a good location - close to the train station and also within walking distance from many sites (Dam Square, Red Light District, etc). One warning is that pick pockets run rampant through the Red Light District so be careful with your purses and wallets if you choose to roam through that area of town (which I recommend because it's just so unlike any place you can find in the U.S.). My boyfriend and I both wore those thin fanny packs that you wear under your clothes when walking around there. I didn't feel comfortable carrying a purse. Sounds dorky, but it made me feel a million times more comfortable. My favorite part of town was the area close to the Westerkirk and the Anne Frank House. We got lost one day roaming the streets in the area and were so happy to be lost because the streets on that side of the city seemed to be more residential and quiet. They were BEAUTIFUL to roam through. Always have a map on you though! Another recommendation is to check out Amsterdam's Smallest Gallery which is located on one side of the Westerkirk building. Really bright, funky paintings depicting the city of Amsterdam can be found here. My boyfriend and I purchased one to bring home and frame. We didn't want to buy any T-shirts or traditional touristy gifts for ourselves so we were pleased to have found this art gallery as a way to remember our fun trip.

Of course, this is to be expected in the heart of any European city, but it was so cramped that my husband couldn't walk from one end of the room to the other if I was at the desk (in fact, it was hard enough to squeeze by when someone wasn't at the desk). Our room was in the \"other\" tower (the hotel has bought the building next door), and it was well decorated and clean. The bathroom setup was odd (toilet flushing mechanism was strange and there was only half a shower door), but that is likely just a cultural difference. There was no view (only the windows of the apartments across the way) and the noisy church bells went off through the entire night, but the A/C and closed window kept the noise at bay.

To say it was loud was an understatement -to be honest my husband found it tough to get 40 winks, and would frequently go for walks alone in an effort to become fatigued. The noise in the hotel was sufficiently bad for my husband such that a brisk 30 minute walk twice a day, alone, was the only way he could achieve sleep. Having arrived on Friday evening, we checked into the hotel and went for a drink locally. There was a large group of young men in the local London Bridge bar, shouting loudly and raucously with recourse to bad language. One young man vomited in the direction of our drinks, to the amusement of his colleagues, before repeating this activity 4 times before insulting the manageress with an Alex Ferguson jibe an quickly leaving. Another young man with long hair and tight trousers appeared asleep and wasresting his head on a full table which could easily have been used by others. He appeared to have been drugged. A heavy waft of marijuana emanated from another pasty young man who spoke with a heavy Dublin accent and whose eyes were rolling back in his head. He also vomited before ordering another hand rolled cigarette and leaving for a brief period. He returned roughly 15 minutes later, shouting loudly about being \"ripped off\" and menacingly shouting at my husband \"the nookers should take their time\". He proceeded to sit back down with the group and commenced rolling another cigarette. My husband and I were aghast to find that this group were also staying in our hotel, and when the room became heavy with the smell of marijuana, my husband again excused himself, saying he'd never get 40 winks if he stayed put. Just at that point an elderly man, similar in appearance to Peter Ebdon, flew past us in a wheelchair and a tuxedo. He was sweating considerably and had what looked like flour on his face. He was followed closely by a man who looked like Brian O Driscoll, the rugby footballer, who in turn was being followed by the police. He sprinted past the wheelchair bound Ebdon character before turning the chair around and free wheeling it towards police in an effort to put distance between him and them. We found out this was not in fact Brian O Driscoll but instead a young man who was attempting to smuggle certain items out of the country.

The hotel is clean, modern, and in the perfect location - it's not the cheapest option, but you do get what you pay for - peace of mind that on reaching Amsterdam you won't find yourself staying in a dive located miles away from the various attractions. The Golden Tulip is just off of a main road, 5-10 minutes walk from Centraal Station, as well as all the other main sights.(On exiting the station, look for the Victoria Hotel on the corner of a parade of buildings, head for the other end of the parade, continue down that road, and the Golden Tulip is just on your left). I cant stress how pleased we were with the location - simply perfect. We had an Executive room, which probably isnt all that different from the standard ones, so on my next visit I may just settle for a normal room as I doubt I'll have any complaints. Our room was at the front of the hotel, but as The Golden Tulip is located on a small square just off of the main road, noise was not a problem at all. I found the hotel staff to be polite, and checking-in & checking-out were both prompt and hassle free. The hotel has numerous bars and restaurants literally on its doorstep - Wok To Walk is handy for a quick bite, and for a \"proper\" meal you have Humphrey's next door, or a steak place directly opposite. I also highly recommend the Betty Boop coffee shop 10 seconds across from the hotel - friendly, well-appointed, and so convenient that it's easy to spend way too much time \"chilling\" at the bar ....trust me, I know! ;-) (And make sure you try the special chocolate cake! The results are pretty interesting! lol) (Also, there is a small grocery store across the main road to the left of the hotel for any bits and pieces, and the Pancake Bakery isnt too far either - well worth a visit.) The complimentary wi-fi is also worth noting for those of you who travel with a laptop, and for those of you who dont, there are two computers for guest use in the bar area - very handy.

The hotel is conveniently situated on a small square just off Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal close to Central station and most of the other sights of Amsterdam including Dam Sq., the Anne Frank House and of course, the Red Light District. We arrived at 9 pm and were greeted by very helpful friendly staff. Our room was well appointed and spacious. Although designated \"twin\" it held 2 queen-sized beds. The bathroom was large and spotless with large fluffy towels. As we had arrived late and were more tired than we'd expected, we decided to make a cuppa before next deciding what to do. I filled the kettle and switched it on and soon it was boiling over. \"You've overfilled it\", my better half said. I didn't think so but it WAS boiling over. Anyway, she drank her coffee, I my tea and as I got to the bottom I discovered what appeared to be a short fat piece of spaghetti. On closer inspection it turned out to be a magic mushroom (Columbian we later found out). Inside the kettle were about 2 dozen of the things which I guess the previous occupant had been brewing. I took the kettle down to the front desk and the staff were extremely apologetic and helpful (as they should be) and gave me suggestions if there should be any adverse effects and supplied a brand new kettle. I have to say, a little whistfully, there were no 'adverse' effects. Next morning we set out early and when we arrived back in our room around 10 am there was a wonderful letter of apology, deploring their fall in standards, a basket of fruit, a bottle of very good wine and a selection of cheeses. You know, I like Amsterdam, where else can you get magic mushrooms, wine, fruit and cheeses all for free LOL. That was the only slight hitch in the entire stay and to be honest, it makes a good after-dinner story. The hotel was superb, from the room to the bar area with its large open fire. Breakfast (included) was excellent. Next door to the hotel is an excellent retaurant, Humphreys, which I can highly recommend, a 3 course, splendid meal for less than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 per person.

The mini bar allowed you to place your own drinks in it without thinking you were taking theirs. I hate those new mini bars with electronic sensors. The A/C worked fine and allowed you to leave the fan running all the time. It did make a loud click every time the compressor went on and off but my sound machine camouflaged it and the second night I didn't even notice it. The TV got a nice picture and had BBC. The hotel was close to everything except the museums, but the tram to the museums went right by the hotel. We didn't eat the expensive breakfast but instead walked across the street and bought fruit and pastries. When we got to Amsterdam we bought an IAmsterdam card at the airport, which is worth it. You get a canal tour, entrance to most museums (but not the Anne Frank house), and use of the trams. It comes in 24, 48, and 72 hour versions. My favorite museums were Amstelkring (a church in the top of an old house) and Rijksmuseum. The red light district made me a little nervous because of all the weed and prostitutes, but it is only a small part of a nice city. It reminded me of Bourbon Street in New Orleans.

The Hotel's located in a good spot, set in a quiet square just off Nieuwendijk and Niuwezijds Voorburgwal, 500m or so from Centraal Station. Easy access to most areas via trams or on your toes and there's a bike hire place just a few doors down. Restaurants and bars around the hotel offer relatively cheap eating with Humphrey's having a pretty good, fixed 3 course for euro 20 pp. The Five Bells on the other side of the hotel entrance has a good grill menu and is another choice for a well-priced eating option. We had booked an executive room but we were upgraded on arrival to a business room on the 4th floor ( not sure how much of a difference there is but the receptionist said it was a better room) Check-in was quick and the staff were efficient and nice enough. Our room was in the 2nd building which is connected by a glass walkway and getting there involved a lift ride to the 2nd floor, a wander across to the other lift and up to the 4th floor. Sounds like a trek but it was no bother, the lifts are swift with very little wait time. The room itself was a good size with a king size double bed , flat screen tv, workstation, fridge/mini bar, safe in the closet and an iron with an ironing board hinged onto the back of the closet door. The bathroom was also a good size with a bath at one end, an excellent shower at the other and large vanity unit between. Both rooms were spotless and the daily housekeeping was worthy of praise. On the down side, there was some minor work going on in the hotel but it wasn't obvious and not much of an issue where we were. Guests staying in other rooms closer to the area being worked on may have suffered a bit though as there was some drilling one morning but it didn't last long.

Perhaps that's why the relationship between our room's price and its quality was so entirely out of whack. I booked via AmEx travel, and this hotel was the only one they could find with rooms. They got us two rooms at 330 euros per night per Standard room. My complaints: - The rooms are small. As in Parisian hotel room small, not like American hotel small. With four people in a room it felt very crowded. - The staff was extremely unpleasant. Our room had trouble with its keycard locking system, which turned into an epic saga of irritation. I tried my card in the lock on the first night. It didn't work, so I went downstairs for a new card figuring my phone had zapped it or something. This key also proved to not work. I asked at the desk for help, noting that there was no audible or visual feedback from the key reader when I tried the key (normally if you get a bad read there's a red light and a beep). The surly staff member at the desk ignored this input and insisted on our going up the elevator and across the hotel so he could try the key. Guess what? It didn't work. He then grouchily left to get a physical device that plugs into the door lock mechanism, and after returning with it, unlocked the room. I asked him to make sure this was sorted out so we didn't have a repeat performance the next time out of the hotel. The next evening when we returned, the lock mechanism had not been fixed, hence my card didn't work and I had to leave my friends standing in the hallway for 15 minutes whilst I went to reception. I ran the staff member who eventually attended to me through the situation. He insisted on coming up to try the key himself despite my protestations that it was a waste of time. When the key indeed failed to work as I knew it would, he then had to find someone to let us in with the unlocking device. Once we finally were inside and relaxing, a member of maintenance staff came and opened our door fully to the hall and sat on the floor poking at the lock mechanism ineffectively until eventually giving up. Fortunately, though, they got the lock fixed during our next trip out of the hotel. Now, I understand that 'stuff' happens and things go wrong. That's fine - something like this can happen at any hotel property. What diferentiates among gradations of the hotel is the grace and and ease of getting the problem fixed. This was unbelievably unpleasant. The staff who helped with this acted as if it was my fault and that I was inconveniencing them. (Multiple staff members). Totally not acceptable. - Rate change switcheroo. I booked thru AmEx for 330e per night. I have a printout from AmEx travel services to this effect. However, I unfortunately didn't have it with me when I checked out. They charged me 360e per night per room, and when I told them the booking was definitely at 330e, they told me to call the manager when I got home to sort it out. This information was also delivered in a surly manner. On the upside, the hotel is in a very convenient location, there is a bike rental shop next door, the rooms were quite quiet, and the sheets were soft. However I do not expect to be treated poorly at a >300e per night hotel, so I will not be gracing this hotel again. This hotel is worth <200e per night. I've had better service many times at low-end hotels around the world. In Amsterdam, I recommend the Banks Mansion instead.

Famous for drugs, prostitutes and sex shows. So do yourself a favour and book a central hotel in all the action but that makes you feel safe at and comfortable at night. After 24 hours of being offered hardcore drugs by hardcore men this is exactly what the Golden Tulip provided! The hotel was booked online with lastminute and was a great find. If you havent been to Amsterdam before the star ratings are equal in quality to those of the UK. On my last trip with 5 lads, 3 star was fine and basic and clean enough to \"crash\". This time with the wife and we agreed to drop an extra star on the end and the difference was everything you'd expect. The hotel is centrally placed 2 small \"blocks\" over the back of the main high street the Damrak. This means it's next door to pubs and restaurants and a small walk from breakfast locations. (This is particularily good to hear as breakfast in the hotel is 20 euros each and a full english can be found only yards away for 6). The Golden Tulip is also only 5 minutes walk from the train station, do not get a cab but if you're really struggling 1.60 euros on a 1,2 or 5 tram is easy as it stops outside the hotel (2nd stop). This line also continues down to other great areas and pubs and to the museum quarter, Heineken experience and the casino area so in itself serves as a day out. The lifts can only be activated by a key card in the hotel and the bar area is very relaxing. They do show football and sports in the hotel but the bar directly next door has a huge screen, food, pool tables and cheaper beer so why hang around? My wife upgraded us to a suite as a birthday suprise and this cost around \u00c2\u00a335 per night. It was well worth the extra as we had a large room with extravigate beems in the old part of the hotel along with a jacuzzi. The only negative on this hotal was the warmth of the particular room I was in. Although understandably a \"unique\" room the aircon thermostat seemed to recognise the temperature was low but refused to do anything but blow out cool air. The electric heater they had put in the room worked but the high ceilings and single pain glass were just too much for it to make a difference.

If you come out the other end of the station and the Victoria Hotel is diagonally across from you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk towards it (that is what we did, wrong way) walk straight to the nearest corner, when you reach the corner and the Victoria is at the corner on the other end of the street continue walking straight don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk toward the Victoria. Walk straight and the hotel will be on the left. The good news is once you know where your at getting back to the station when it is time to leave is a cinch.

If you are looking for a modern hotel with decent rooms within walking distance of everywhere ( & friendly staff ) it is ideal. If you are flying to Amsterdam you can catch a train from the station located in the airport to central Amsterdam for approx 3.60 Euros each way (you get charged extra if you use the ticket office rather than the machines)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and takes 15-20 minutes. Then the hotel is literally 10 minutes walk from the station. We followed another reviewers directions (amended below) and found it quite easily. In Summary \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. If you leave Central Station the side of the trams you can see over the bridge a big hotel called Victoria Hotel. We went over the bridge so the hotel was in front of us and then went right (so the hotel was on our left) and carried on walking until we got to a left turn (you cant miss it)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Turn left down this road and the hotel is down the 4th (ish) road on the left (its easy to see from the road you are on). Regarding restaurants yes there are lots a steak houses, and we tried one about 3-4 doors away from the hotel, as per other reviewers the specials on the boards outside are a lot cheaper then the menus you are offered. The meal was nice enough but nothing special. The next night walked miles looking for a better restaurant, but ended up at Humphries next door to the hotel.

The restaurant next door to the hotel is called Humphrey's we had a 3 course menue (6 choices for each course) and a bottle of red wine oh and a beer the bill came to 59.50 euros very good value and the food was great, the restaurant is very large but looks quit small from the outside so if it looks full go in and ask lots of tabels at the rear. Some of the local restaraunts offer special prices outside but not on the menue inside again you will need to ask about the specials on offer or you will pay more.

Instead, we got a perfectly decent stay but nothing to rave about. Certainly convenience is a major advantage to this property: located in a side alley between two of the city's main shopping streets just a few minutes' walk from Central Station, its location was good. Just along the alley is a cheap, quick noodle bar - great for a filling quick meal if you're fed up with chips with mayonnaise... We asked for a quiet room and were given one overlooking the rooftops at the back of the property, thus avoiding any potential noise drifting over from the numerous bars in the vicinity. The room itself was perfectly OK - just standard chain hotel stuff, though. A well kitted out (again, very small for those more familiar with US hotels) bathroom with good quality fittings complimented our clean, pleasant room. A small TV on a somewhat wonky wall mounting was adequate for us but guests used to large/flat screen efforts in similarly ranked hotels might not be impressed. The mattresses felt like foam and didn't offer a great deal in terms of support. However, for our one night stay it was fine. Our 'twin' room was in fact set up initially as a king, but with two beds pushed together it was simple enough to pull them apart. However, space was not at a premium and so we kept ours close. A rather obvious dried white stain on the generally filthy bedspread was relatively quickly replaced by housekeeping staff. However, we were unimpressed that it was on the bed in such a state to begin with. In all, should you get a good rate on Expedia or similar, I'd recommend this property for its sheer conveneince/location.

The bedrooms are really clean, large with a queen sized bed, such a comfortable matress (foam which snugges around your body), bathrooms are nice and clean the best bit is the bath/shower, the water is just so hot just what you need after walking around all day long. (Tip for sore feet.. put your feet in the bath at the end of the day, put in boiling hot water leave feet in their for 10 minutes). This will get help sooth and heal blisters etc. Nice and quite at nightimes, no noises from the hotel or outside. The breakfast was included in our package, it was OK, choice of continential, fruits, yogurt, Hot boiled eggs, various breads for toast, fruit juices, tea, coffee, Hot Scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, beans. Well what can we say, the Golden Tulip Hotel is a really perfect hotel, better than the Swissotel in Dam Square where we stayed last year which was awful especially at twice the price of the Golden Tulip.!!! We went to Madam Tussads in Dam Square paid \u00c2\u00a330 GP. for two adults, what a load of rubbish save your money and go and do something else. Just another tip, the Trams stop at midnight, however the buses take over and they don't stop unti 6am then the trams take over again, you will never be stranded. (Trams have two entrance doors and two exit doors make sure you try to go to the right doors, we had great fun working this out!!! NOT!! LOL) Main shopping street if just off Dam Square, really cheap and so trendy, we brought loads of tops, funky jeans etc. For a dinner something different around the corner from the Tulip Hotel is KOBE sushi restaurant, they cook the food on your table, a bit expensive but what a lovely night and the waiters are really nice, open until 11pm.

There is no milk for tea's (although there is the powdered stuff for the coffee) and by the way the double rooms have a double bed (not two pushed together). I'm letting you know this because the first night they put us in the wrong room from the one we had paid for, but were very apologetic about the whole thing and let us have a much nicer one.

We booked a superior room on one of the Dutch booking websites to get the best price, and were not disappointed. The staff are polite and welcoming, with very good service. The bar/lounge area is lovely - an open fire is situated in the middle, which adds a traditional feel to this otherwise modern hotel. There are also two computers for free internet access. The location is great - quiet in the evenings, so no trouble sleeping, but just a short walk from Dam square. There is a main tram stop on the main road just a short walk from the hotel, and although the hotel is less than a 10 minute walk from central station, you won't hear any trains. The only thing you won't get with this hotel is a view, as it isn't by a canal, or on Dam square itself, but it didn't bother us. The room wasn't huge, but certainly clean and comfortable, offering everything we needed - hangers, tea tray, TV with English channels and films (and porn if you want it)! (This is Amsterdam, after all - if you have kids, don't let them turn on the tv unsupervised!) The bathroom was clean, and the decor was in good condition. The only thing which disappointed us was the breakfast. They will offer you a discount voucher for breakfast when you check in, so that you pay 12.50 euros, but it's not worth it. Luckily, we hadn't booked it in advance, so we popped in one morning just to try it and see if it's worth the price, but it isn't! It's a shame, as it is the only fault of the hotel, and the breakfast room looks lovely from the outside, but it's not a problem, as there are loads of restaurants and tea rooms within a two minute walk, offering a much cheaper, English breakfast. I would stay at this hotel again, but eat out for breakfast. We did see other hotels around the canals, probably with better views, but they didn't look as nice to be honest. When you are looking for the hotel, be aware that it says 'Golden Tulip Inntel' on the front, and not 'Golden Tulip Amsterdam Centre' as you might expect. I've given this hotel 4 rather than 5 simply because of the lack of breakfast and view.
