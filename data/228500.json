We booked two nights B and B but on the first morning when we went down to breakfast it was like a monkeys' tea party. Coffee is provided from three coffee machines, when we arrived, only two were working with a queue of about eight at each machine. Ten minutes later all three machines were out of service. The tables were not cleared as people left and it was every man for himself. The staff, like so many in the hotel industry in Spain, did their best: their best to avoid listening to customers' complaints or providing any remedial action. They disappeared with trolleys of dirty crockery and stayed gone. When we left tea or three of them were valiantly trying to fill orders for coffee at a bar espresso machine. That day I went to reception and told them we would not require breakfast the next morning, and, unlike in any reasonable hotel, was not asked if this was due to dissatisfaction, just told: \"fine sir\", while he tapped at a keyboard. Nevertheless they tried to bill me for two breakfasts on checkout. Don't book breakfast: bring a travel kettle and coffee and do a quick food shop in the supermarket directly under the hotel The rooms are basic and small but the addition of a balcony reduces the claustrophobia.

Disappointed with reception staff's lack of interest and pro-activity in advising re facilities, sights, offers etc. Some had very little English. As advised on Tripadvisor, we booked executive room - very average - would not like to have seen basic room! No water / teasmade; had to request more soap, poor fridge contents; wi-fi in rooms but subject to charge. Had dinner in restaurant on day of arrival - very limited, but staff very friendly and helpful. (The Roma restaurant across the road provided two excellent fillet steaks the following night). Buffet breakfast was average, but on the Sunday, the large crowd could not be accomodated- food / juices ran out and long queues for coffee meant that food was cold when we got back to table. Did get call on night of return home from manager, not apologising, but thanking us for comments left. As for the city -wow, so exciting and definitely worth a visit! Try and take in a Barca match, even if your'e not a football fan.While the match wasn't great, the experience was amazing.What I particularly liked (apart from the Messi and Iniesta skills) was the absence of any hint of rowdyism; also, the presence of many elderly couples . Beware though, a can of Coke cost Euro 4! Take a hop on/ hop off, a great way to get your bearings and an overview of what's to see. Our favourites were the Montjuic area, which included the 1992 Olympic statium, Parc Guell, with its Gaudi treats, and above all, the still unfinished Sagrada Familia basilica. While the outside is wonderful, the inside is truly beautiful (the nearest thing to heaven on this earth!), and well worth the queuing. Finally, a few tips: the metro is great value and easy to use. A ten trip ticket costing Eur 9.65 gives access to trains, metro and buses - we travelled back to the airport on this. Be prepared for hilly walks, if going to Park Guell!

My initial price was 203.79 Euros, payable on check out. The hotel is just across the road from the Santa Barcelona Estacio, which provides metro links to the city and beyond and also the main rail line from the Airport. Arriving earlier than scheduled and with a smooth run from the airport by the R2 railway to Sants was great, and I thought we may have to wait to check in, as it stated 1500 but we turned up at 1300 and still was able to get our room. The receptionist was friendly and spoke very good English; although I tried out my very basic Spanish on her she was great! - Thank you. We were offered the upgrade, from basic to executive due to the standard rooms having twin beds. So we accepted at an extra 5 Euros a night. The lobby area is fresh, clean and very modern. The lifts were quick and clean, and the approach to our room on the 9th floor was clean. The hotel chambermaids were friendly and welcomed us with a cheery 'Hola Buenos dias'. The room itself I would not consider 'Executive' however not having stayed or looked into a standard room I wouldn\u2019t be able to compare nor comment. But in my opinion was more of a standard room compared to some Executive rooms I have stayed in throughout Europe. We didn\u2019t take the breakfast offered at 8 Euros (from the reception) as there is a cafe in the stations that had plenty of light bites and coffee, both of us had cafe con leche (like a latte) and croissants and a sandwich for 13 Euros. Upon check out on day three I was surprised by my bill, as even though we upgraded to the \u2018Executive\u2019 room the bill actually still only came to 203 Euros, which turned out to be the same price I booked for a standard room. Hope this was blind luck on my part and that the hotel doesn\u2019t take more money off me now I have posted it! :) I know this is a review for a hotel but I thought I would mention how great the transport links are in and out of the centre of the city, we used a T-10 ticket which allowed 10 trips to any station on the metro in Zone 1 much like the oyster card for the underground in London. Also the Barcelona tourist bus, we used it, 24 Euros for a full day, which was enough to get around the blue and red lines, which took you past all the usual and prominent tourist attractions... also back to our hotel (stopping at Sants station). All in all a great stop and well worth staying at the Expo Hotel Barcelona for great city links and a friendly environment.

We got to the hotel from the airport via the Renfe train service from the Airport (pictures clearly posted to help non-spanish speakers find it!) to Barcelona Sants train station. It took about 15 mins on the train costing \u20ac3.50 each, and when we got out of the station the Hotel was right there. No more than a 90 second walk, though don't worry about hearing trains all night, cause like the subway, the train station is underground. We checked in easily and they gave us some free hotel-made papers with different places to visit and opening times etc. This was very useful and was gratefully accepted. We had booked an executive room and so were on the 8th floor at the front of the hotel. Nice views all round, bed was comfy and staff were welcoming. We used a safe at a cost of \u20ac3 per day. We bought a rail pass for \u20ac25 each which gave us 5 days unlimited travel on all trains, subways and buses. Would strongly recommend, they also do shorter and longer times if need be. Went up to the roof terrace which is open till 1am. Had a pint and a glass of average wine. We ordered a pizza to share and at \u20ac11 we were disappointed to find it was a mass-made Dr. Ouitker pizza that Tesco's sell in the UK for about \u00a32! We had breakfast the first morning in the hotel for \u20ac10 each, just for ease of use (3rd floor resturant), though were glad not to have booked breakfast every morning as it was average. During our trip we were very happy with the room, the cleanliness and cleaning-staff and staff in reception. We however got the feeling (this was for the entire holiday, not just the Expo) that the staff in any bar and/or roof terrace would favour serving spanish visitors before others. The pool on a floor above the 10th roof terrace bar provided fresh towels and enough sun loungers for a small army. The pool was smallish but did the job. It wasn't as 'spit-spot' clean as I was hoping, but as it's coming to the end of the season, I imagine they'll clean it soon! The air conditioning was brilliant in our room, and did the job nicely, the fans however made a constant noise on the roof when you wanted to sunbathe by the pool. Our room was quiet and peaceful until the last morning when the person next door had an alarm going off from 7:30am. After 25 mins I rang up reception and they said they'd send someone up to sort it. though another 25 mins later it was still going off. We booked through lastminute.com and for flights, car parking and hotel, we got it all for \u00a3330 each, so good value I think! Hotel was excellent and we were happy to get a nicer hotel for a cheaper price, by just having to travel to the Las Ramblas by a 5 minute (air-conditioned!) tube. Try to avoid eating at the hotel, partly cause its not great food, and partly because you're in Barcelona so you should go out and get some culture!

They exhibit some interesting art work, especially on the floor where the dining and conference rooms are located. On your first day, I recommend the terrace bar, as it affords expansive views of the city, especially Montjuic, and The Palau Nacional.

First thing, I had specifically asked for a room with a double bed when booking it on booking.com.

They could have told us upon arrival knowing what we had asked for! So forget about this hotel's normal rooms if you're looking for a romantic week-end. The room itself was quite large, but I wouldn't define it as nice, decoration consisted in 1 painting, the sheets had holes in them, which is not acceptable in a four star hotel, and the sink in the bathroom smelled bad...the tv was old and could only be seen from 1 of the two beds because the room was long and narrow...The room wasn't terrible, but it was definitely not 4 star standard.

So the romantic time away was spoiled by this. We were moved to a double room halfway through the stay and were told it was an executive room. However, I have stayed in many hotels for work and this was a 3 star hotel room, the only difference for the executive is that we had a dressing gown and a razor set. Not worth it! The rooms however, were both quite spacious with a fairly large bathroom. There were separate walk-in wardrobes which had a safe (but you had to pay 3 Euros a day for it). The rooms however are quite noisy, partially due to the location (right by the main train station) and also due to the tiled floors and thin walls and ceilings. The location is convenient right by the main train station and also close to Tarragona metro stop. You can get there directly from the airport, so saves having to drag your bags around lots of back streets. The breakfast was large and plentiful. However, did have an issue getting a clean table and plates each day.

There is an additional charming bar on the roof (with an equally charming bartender, Juan, who I believe is Cuban & had the ability to treat everyone with equal charm, yet manage to make it seem as if it was genuinely reserved for you alone. Quite a valuable trait in the hospitality industry) but, alas, the weather interfered with our enjoyment of that feature. Our booking did not include a meal plan and upon check-in we inquired about breakfast & were quoted a current special of 9 euros per day. Seemed a bit pricey until the next morning - it was a feast of everything from cold cereals to hot egg dishes (several different ones each day) juices, hot beverages, several breads and rolls and an entire sideboard of pastries and as a serve yourself buffet, it was also all you could eat - very nice for the two of us who like to have a big breakfast to fortify our day of walking, walking, walking with only a small snack to tide us over until dinner.. There was ample room for everyone to not only secure a table (no matter what time we showed up), but be able to move about getting whatever you wanted without knocking into someone else's table. One cold, rainy day we stayed in for dinner, which was quite tasty - the only down side being my pork tenderloin dish having two pieces slightly overdone & one piece with a big raw spot. I like my pork pink & juicy, but not raw. Every other aspect of dinner - as well as snacks & drinks in the bar another day - was very tasty and not priced out of line for the area and season.

However the location isn't that brilliant if you want late night bars and restaurants: there are a few around the area, but it's more of a train ride than a walk to the city centre and most of the action. Just the other side of the hotel is the stop for the tourist bus, which we found to be a great way to see Barcelona in one day, even if it was pricey, at 21 Euro each. The Expo itself was obviously once a very good 4 star hotel, but its now a bit run down, with cracked tiles everywhere, and mould in the bathroom. On checking in we were offered and upgrade - for 12 euro a nit - to an executive room, which I declined, but they then gave me the upgrade anyway, as they'd run out of normal rooms with double beds: the clue here seems to be always to ask for a double to get an upgrade. The executive rooms are newer, and larger, with a balcony overlooking the station. In the room itself, the TV didn't work, and despite asking the hotel for help, it was never fixed, and only gave 2 channels. There is a Minibar but no kettle or cups. On the third floor there is a business centre, with Internet a pricey 2 euro for 15 minutes, and a pleasant if rather dull Bar, with Damn beer on tap, and at the far end a normally pretty deserted Restaurant which has a buffet at 22 euro per person: pricey, but with excellent all-you-can-eat food. On the 9th floor there is another (very small) bar, which does bar snacks, and on the 10th floor is the pool, which has to be the worst feature of the hotel. It is very run down, with lots of chipped tiles, and tiny. However, because the hotel has little going on around it, I always found the pool packed.

I would think carefully before chosing the Expo however, but only because it is hard to guess what type of traveller it is aimed at. I picked it becuase it is close to the train station and I knew I would have lots of bags with me. It would seem to be a good business hotel (plenty of space to work in room, faultless pay as you go internet and a separate business centre that I didn't try), provided it is close to where you need to be, becuase the area itself is a little dead, and, relatively speaking, fairly far from the centre. I can't imagine it would be attractive to tourists, although it does have a nice pool/bar area. The staff were definitely one of the best features of the hotel - they were interested, motivated and effceint and went out of their way to help me.

We took the train from the airport to the Sants station and simply walked across the street to the hotel. We had booked an executive king room and when we saw the setup, it did not look like the picture on the web site. I went back to the front desk and they immediately moved us to a corner room on the 8th floor which was more spacious and had a window in the bathroom, providing extra light and ventilation. The room was spotless and we had a nice balcony. There are only a couple of minor negatives about the hotel--the blackout drapes behind the sheer curtains had a few small holes; we had difficulty getting the television to work several times and could not get the hotel menu to disappear and access the regular channels. We found only two channels in English--CNN and BBC News. However, during our stay, a large tour group arrived for a couple of days and suddenly the TV worked better and we actually saw Jay Leno one night near the end of our stay. I think the hotel must have done something with the satellite to make improvements. The bed was very firm, but not to the point of being uncomfortable. The shower was fantastic. The buffet breakfast was included with our stay, which we booked on the hotel's web site. The variety was good--lots of fresh fruit, smoked salmon, brie cheese, pastries, eggs, potatoes, bacon & sausage, various kinds of bread, cereal and juices. We missed having the occasional bowl of oatmeal, waffles or pancakes. However, toward the end of our 9 days, we did see french toast. The quality of the breakfast was very good and it was so convenient to grab breakfast and head out for a day of sightseeing. Be aware that there will be a slight sewer odor in the lobby at times which isn't a problem because we didn't spend any time there. This seems to be a problem throughout the city in various buildings, especially in the restrooms of restaurants, etc. We highly recommend this hotel. It is quieter than some other locations in the city, you can go to the Sants Train Station across the street to take a train virtually anywhere, the Metro is two blocks away, and there is a Supermarket right next door where you can purchase almost anything, including some great wines and cava at very reasonable prices. The front desk staff is very helpful and accommodating and the neighborhood is safe to walk, even at night. The maid did an excellent job of maintaining our room each day. We did not use the safe and no valuables were ever missing, which is so important when carrying passports, etc. We finally had a chance to use the rooftop pool on our last day. There is also a lounge up there and the views are incredible. There are lots of chaises and the attendant provides the towels.

This hotel is in a great location for any travellers who wish to attend Barca games, as it's only 3 stops from Tarragona to Les Courts on the Metro green line (L3). I bought a T-10 card (\u20ac7.70) on arrival at the airport train station, and we caught the train to Sants station, which took just 25 mins. We then just walked the 300-400m to the hotel from the station. The T-10 gives you 10 journeys and can be used on the metro and the train and was a cheap and effective way for us both to get about the city - real value for money The first impressions were good, as the reception staff were very friendly and helpful, (especially Ruben) and the hotel lobby is clean & modern. I booked an Executive Twin Room and it was value for money in my opinion. We were allocated Room #825 which had a nice view towards the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (MNAC). The room was clean, modern and spacious, and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was nice and the towels were replenished each day.We had no issues with noise at all, however, I don't think the hotel was anywhere near capacity, due to the time of year. Thanks to the tips provided on here, I booked a room only basis, as I thought \u20ac16 per person for breakfast was expensive. We were actually offered breakfast at \u20ac9 per person at check-in, but declined, as the bakery and hypermarket are on the same block as the hotel as pointed out by previous reviewers. The only other minor criticism of the hotel is that they charge \u20ac3.21 per day for use of the safety deposit box in the rooms, but as I was only there for 2 night's, it wasn't a major issue On arrival, we were offered 2hrs free wifi use and given two free drink vouchers for use at the bar on the 3rd floor, which we took advantage of after dumping our stuff in our room! It's a very nicely appointed, modern bar and the service was good. (Special thanks to staff, Elena & Raul, who were both good fun). The pool terrace/bar was closed which I assume was down to the time of year, so we didn't get to see that. We didn't eat in the restaurant whilst we stayed there, however, there are 3 restaurants across the road to choose from in the immediate area. I can't remember the name of it, but the one to the right of the Marrakech bar, as you look from the hotel entrance, was good, as it had a restaurant/bar and also offered a tapas menu which suited us nicely and was reasonably priced too. Didn't go in the Marrakech Bar, and the Galician restaurant looked overpriced. Obviously, a trip to Barca isn't complete without a trip to La Ramblas and even though it looks a few stops away on the Green L3 line, if you get on at Tarragona metro station, within 5-6mins you will be at Dressanes (bottom of La Ramblas) or 7-8mins you will be at the top, Catalunya. The Metro is superb - reliable, easy to understand and very punctual. In terms of travellers worried about safety etc, we walked from Tarragona Metro station each night to the hotel late on, without any problems at all, and felt safe wherever we were in the city to be honest.

These rooms more likely got a lick of paint and some new curtins and that was it. This hotel was by far the noisest hotels I 've ever stayed at. Walls are paper thin The housekeeping started every morning at around 7am. All the rooms have tiled floors so from 7 on prepare to get no more sleep what with furniture being dragged on floors ect. The reception staff were nice if not a little slow. We were waiting 35mins in the queue to checkout. We were overcharged for mini bar stuff we did not have but was so tired couldn't be bothered arguing over the 12\u20ac. Also one of our party had terrible problems checking out whereby staff were telling him they could not accept his visa as it was being declined so a friend paid for him. He then rang visa in case there was fraud on his card and it turned out that the hotel had already been given authorisation to take the money the previous day which they had done so received double payment and there was no problem with his card, the problem was on the hotels side. I would have hated to try and sort the problem over the phone when we go home. As hotels go I guess it wasn't that bad. I wouldn't recommend it for familys with toddlers as the tiles are very rough and I niped my feet more than once. It suited us fine as we weren't sightseeing this time and were able the sleep during the afternoon(thru the noise) to energise for the nightlife. We didn't eat in the hotel.

I've stayed in 5 different 4-star hotels in Barcelona in the past two years, and this was the worst, by far. They have upgraded rooms which they ask 15 euro a night for; this may explain the different reviews you see here. I had one of the non-upgraded rooms, on the 4th floor. Location is good but not great. If you prefer the area of the Sants station, then this is a perfect location, as it's only a 3-minute walk to the station, the airport shuttle and the metro (Tarragona is the nearest metro stop). If you're interested in the major touristic sites, virtually nothing is walking distance. The room I had was narrow and long. It smelled stuffy but this improved when I opened the window. It had two twin beds, very low and with horribly old mattresses which immediately obtain the shape of your body. There was also a sofa, tucked along the little table, so that neither of them could be used properly. The bathroon was small and rather old fashioned, although it was clean and everything worked properly. Reasonable amenities. The windows are not sound-proof, which is a problem in such a central location, especially as the construction work around the station goes on 24 hours a day. Air-conditioning didn't work. Breakfast had a mediocre selection if mediocre things. Nothing compared to some of the nicer hotels in the same area. Worst of all was the attitude of the staff: always sour, never a smile. I asked to leave a piece of luggage for two days and was refused. I asked for a non-smoking room and was lectured about how my reservation didn't specify it, and how cheap a rate I got, etc. They seem to be perfectly happy with the stream of tourist groups that the hotel focuses on. There are so much nicer hotels in Barcelona, I can't see why anyone would choose this one.

And also i wanted a hotel which had a swimming pool AND bed and breakfast( which are quite hard to find without paying a hifty price). Taxi from the airport was just over 20 euros, which wasn't too bad since we only made the journey twice. I bought a twin bedroom off the internet but i asked to swap to a double when i checked in since it didn't cost any more. The service from staff was really good from reception, they all could speak a good amount of english apart from the staff that work at breakfast time. The first room we spend 1 night in, we spent most of the day out but when we came back we realised the TV wasn't working properly and the lock on the bathroom door jams, we only found that out when my boyfriend locked himself in and it took us 15 minutes to get him out. (Oh, there only 4 english channels and there are news! unless your really good at spanish then its not good for people who like to spend alot of time in their hotel). We changed the next day into a double room on thh ninth floor, this was better because we were practically a few steps away from the roof top pool (which is small but there where never more that 6 people in the pool at the same time so their load of room, oh there is plently of room to sunbathe) and also the tv worked completely better. Breakfast was really nice, i massive choice of fried food, e.g bacon, egg etc. Lots of fresh fruit and different types of pastries. The rooms have balcones, if your going soon to hotel expo and hotel sants which are located practically next door to eachother (with another hotel i can't remember its name) that there is construction taking place next to them, this didn't cause us any problems since we spent most of our time exploring barcelona and the only real time we heard noice was in the morning when we opened the doors leading to the balcony. There are two bars, one is new and located on the roof and is open until 1am to to look at the star and the great skyline, which is very good but i would advise you not to go up too late because their were hardly any tables to sit down and drink! To get around we took the metro system, for both of us for 5 days it was 33 eursos which wasn't a bad price to say that we used them all the time to get around the whole of barcelona. The lines are all over the place and the red and blue line was a 5 minutes walk from the hotel. These lines as well as the green took us to the most popular attractions. And like my aunt told me when she came back from barcelona, bring your walking sure, there are plently of sight to see and the best way apart from the metro is to walk. oh, the batroom was made out of marble, very lush and reasonably sized. Oh there is a conveince store located next to the hotel, we popped over there to pick up drinks and snacks. The hotel is really good for families and middle aged couples. but me and by boyfriend are 18 and nothing really bothered us while we were there. P.s Bring your phase book.

There was no drinking of cans or eating anything by the pool and if he saw you he rushed over to give you a warning. Always moving the beds to be in rows and just making sure that you didn't have an enjoyable time. There were other instances that my niece had to intervene on too.
