There is ample free parking. Good location near International Drive, though it's VERY difficult to get in and out of Canada Ave. onto Sand Lake at certain times of day. We visited in March and had loads of teenagers in the hotel. One night around 10 pm we heard dozens of teens frolicking in the pool and it woke both of our kids up. Great!!!

The breakfast was great and just what we needed to get our day started. Hard boiled eggs, 3 kinda of mini muffins, bagles, waffles, fresh fruit, sausage gravy & biscuits, sausage, juices and coffee. The pool was soooo refreshing after a day of being around town. On our first night there was a water problem with the room above us, not something that was in their control.

We booked it whilst it was a Marriot hotel and it changed ownership before our arrival. I was a little worried about this but need not have been. We Stayed in a Disney hotel last year and were very pleased with that but for half the price the Quality Inn and Suites proved such value for money. My only fault would be the noisy air conditioning. We couldn't sleep with it on and it was a little too warm with it turned off. Other than that we were totally pleased with our stay. The hotel is not posh but everything is in good working order, clean and tidy and the staff are friendly and do an excellent job. Being on Canada Drive is a plus as it's very quiet for sleeping and only a 5 min walk to International Drive over a grassed area along side the hotel. Use the I-Ride Trolley to get everywhere. No need for a car as a 2 week ticket only cost 17 dollars and you can use it for your whole stay as many times as you like! The hotel has a shuttle to Universal Studios at 8.10 am and 2 return journeys that change times each month...ours were 7.00pm and 8.25pm. If you want to go at different times you can get the I- Ride to Wet & Wild, cross the road and walk over the bridge and you are at the Bus and Taxi rank. This walk takes 10-15 mins on a big path on a flat road, it's easy. The I- Ride starts at 8.00am and finishes at 10.30pm and goes to the Premium outlets, north and south. You can also get to Seaworld and Aquatica plus so many shops and places to eat. The driver will tell you which stop to get off if you want to catch a link bus to Disney World, I think it was stop 29. So no need to pay car hire costs, insurance, petrol and parking fees...it's a brilliant service and the wait is never more than 20 mins. Sometimes you may have to stand. Back to the hotel now!!!!! Our room was quite plain but comfortable and well equipped. It was all in perfect working order and cleaned every day to a good standard. Flat screen TV, Coffee maker, Ironing board and Iron, Toiletries plus plenty of room and 2 lovely big beds that were really nice to sleep on. The breakfast was well organized and plentiful. There were cereals, juices, mini doughnuts and muffins, bread, bagels, cream cheese, jams, cold boiled eggs, biscuits and sausage gravy, yogurts, bananas, apples, oranges and make your own waffles and syrup. There was also a microwave oven and 2 toasters. Tea, Coffee and Hot Chocolate were available all day in the breakfast room. Safety deposit boxes were free of charge in the reception. 2 computers were also free of charge by the reception area. There was also a laundry room which we did not use. The pool and garden area were always very clean and had a nicely heated pool and a very warm hot tub. Enough sun beds for everyone and clean towels by the gate. It was nice and relaxed by the pool as hardly anyone used it and you could nip in and get a Coffee as and when you wanted one. A few trees and plants around the hotel and pool but not many. The staff were always polite and cheerful and ready to help with any questions, couldn't fault them. If on a budget or not, this hotel is a great choice. If you want to spend double then go to the Port Orleans as we did last year. We got what we paid for at both hotels and would recommend. We saw a leaflet at the hotel saying that it was going to soon become a Comfort Inn.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cVery nice!\u201d", "Author": "ecarley", "ReviewID": "UR126365021", "Content": "You can definitely tell this is a former Fairfield- very nice grounds, pool, breakfast area, etc. It is a great value for the Quality Inn price!

There was a musty smell to our room/hallway, but the a/c helped eliminate that.

Could not find hotel. I-Drive has a lot of roads/hotels leading onto it and it is so easy to drive past the one you need. Anyway, finally arrived at hotel to a good welcome. Given room key and off we went - King Suite, room 307, 3rd floor, view towards Pirates Dinner. First thing we noticed was the musty smell in the lan1ding, then the musty smell in the room. Next, we checked the sofa bed - not at all good and not useful to sleep on (matress too thin and ripped). Youngest child slept on cusions off sofabed on bedroom floor and eldest shared bed with us. Not ideal, but as the hotel was only somewhere to sleep rather than be entertained, it did. Two TVs in suite but only one used. Breakfast - lots of choice - make your own waffles (my fav), yoghurts, scones (biscuits if you are American), sausage gravy (again - for the Americans), different breads to toast in toasters, cold boiled eggs, mini cakes, two different types of cereal each day, porridge and lots of fruit. Also, milk and juice to drink. Tea/coffeee/hot chocolate available 24/7. Pool good size and each time we used it, we were the only people there so it felt like a private pool! Short cut through grass area gets you to I-Drive. Loads of places to eat - Ponderosa is really good value, just make sure you are hungry - also Chilis, Perkins, McD, BK, Chuck E Cheese (the kids begged us to go there, not my choice), Dennys, Wild Jacks etc. Staff in each eatery very polite - UK take note. I-Ride trolly goes up and down I-Drive, $1.25 for adults and kids under 12 free per paying adult. We went to outlet stores using the I-Ride to make the journey a bit more fun for the kids. Walmart few mins away - loads of Disney stuff for sale which is so much cheaper than Disney and Disney outlet shops. Disney/Universal/Seaworld all within 20 mins driving time. Won't go into too much detail, but kids keep asking when we can go back - says it all really. All in all, if they were to do up the hotel and lose the musty smell we would definitely go back.

Unfortunately, just before our stay, it was sold to the Quality Inn, which worried me, and at that stage I noticed it's rating had dropped from 3.5 when booked, to 2.5. When we arrived, the hotel really presented an abandoned image, signage removed, empty carpark, and skeleton staff. This turned out to be a positive, as the location is very quiet, and there was never any trouble parking. We were kindly upgraded to a suite upon check-in, which gave us more room for our 11 night stay. The halls had a fairly musty smell, but our room smelled fine, it was clean, but quite dated. We had a very noisy air-con unit, and our window could be opened a small amount too. We had a king sized bed, large wardrobe, and large LCD TV in the sleeping area, and a desk, sofa, another LCD and a sound system in the sitting area. The bathroom had a shower and loo, plenty of hot water, and a separate sink is outside, opposite which was a fridge, coffee machine and microwave. The inclusive breakfast consisted of baked goods, donuts, bagels, bread, etc.. and you can make your own waffles. There is juice, milk, tea and coffee, a couple of types of cereal, yoghurt, and after a few days, apples, bananas and oranges. Lots of stodge, but the hotel is a short walk from Dennys, MacD's, and so on, if you fancy a change. There is a small shop which sells basics and snacks, an information area, pool overlooking a 'lake', a couple of computers that are free to use, and a laundry room, with 2 washers and 4 dryers. The hotel also has good free wifi. For an evening meal, Fishbones is at one end of the block and TGI's at the other, and you're just off International Drive. It's also close to Wet and Wild, Universal Studios, and several malls, such as the Premium Outlet and Florida Mall's.

I was on a cruise ship the week prior to arriving Orlando and did not receive notification that the hotel had changed it's name. I drove right by the hotel when I got into town. The second time around, I noticed a small, unlit Fairfield Inn sign on the front wall and figured that must be my hotel. The clerk who assisted me was being trained. The senior agent who was helping him was checking in another guest at the same time. The senior agent advised the junior agent to assign me a ground floor room. I immediately responded that I did not want to be on the ground floor and would like something higher. The senior agent said that would be fine. When the trainee handed me the key, he pointed down the hall and told me that was where I could find room 107. I immediately asked, \"Isn't that on the ground floor?\" \"Yes,\" he replied. \"I just told you I wanted to be above the ground floor.\" \"Oh,\" he responded. \"I'll see if I can move you.\" Eventually, I was moved to the fourth floor. All seemed well until I noticed small black insects jumping around in my white bath tub. I called downstairs and asked the clerk if the hotel was \"pet friendly.\" \"No,\" he replied. \"Well, I think there are fleas in my bathtub.\" \"I'll try to get someone up there to take a look,\" was the response. Within 20 minutes there was a knock on the door. After taking a look at the tub, the clerk said, \"Well, I'm from Arizona and can't really tell you what those things are. I think you should move rooms.\" Another 20 minutes later, I received keys to a room down the hall. I was escorted inside just to make sure there were no fleas in the bathtub. Luckily, there were none. Then I went to turn on the air conditioner -- only to find out that the unit made a grinding and groaning noise for 30 seconds every five minutes. I immediately shut off the air conditioner and opened the window. I called downstairs and told the clerk, \"Look, it's late -- but I want you to know that the air conditioner is broken.\" \"Okay,\" was his response. \"Will you send someone up to check on it -- maybe tomorrow.\" \"Sure.\" \"Are you sure? Are you righting this down,\" \"Sure I am.\" The next morning I stopped a maintenance guy in the hallway and said, \"Excuse me, do you know about my broken air conditioner?\" \"No.\" \"No notes to check on my broken unit?\" \"No.\" I decided to let it go and see if anyone would get to my room by the end of day. (Oh, I did have to tell the housekeeper to put a box of tissue in my room.) I spend the day at Universal Studios and came back later that night. I turned on the air conditioner and to my surprise -- it worked. And no fleas in the tub. And, yes, there's a banner covering the old hotel sign out on the main driveway now.

Breakfast was included in this hotel, which was very nice. You could make your own waffles, there were muffins, toast, yoghurt, eggs, ... You could have a real decent breakfast before visiting any of the theme parks in Orlando. If I would go back to Orlando, and needed a hotel in the proximity of the most theme parks, then I would certainly chose this hotel. Very friendly staff too.

Overall, it was. Excellent location, yummy waffles at breakfast, free shuttle to and from Universal, and special perks as a Universal partner hotel like early admission and restaurant discounts. It suited our needs just fine. The hotel was clean and well-staffed. The breakfast bar was always fully-stocked (though they really need to add water to the breakfast beverage choices - just cold water for drinking). Our room was clean, well-lit, quiet and (mostly) comfortable. My only real complaint was about our mattress. It was hard as a rock, bouncy as a trampoline, and I could feel every single spring in it. Most nights I woke up every hour or so as I couldn't get or stay comfortable. A poor night's sleep makes for a very loooooong day on your feet in a theme park. The only night I slept well was our last night there, when I was so exhausted that I could have fallen asleep on a bed of hot lava. The free shuttle is nice, but be aware that it is not continuous - there is one pick-up time in the morning, and one return time in the evening. Moreover, the morning pick-up time does not get you to Islands of Adventure in time for the early admission in the morning, which was one big reason we chose this hotel. During our stay, early admission to Islands of Adventure started at 8 am, but the shuttle pick-up at the hotel wasn't until 8:10 am, meaning you don't arrive at Universal until about 8:30 and you miss out on valuable time during that early admission period. We took a cab at about 7:45 to make sure we arrived at Islands of Adventure in time to take advantage of early admission. Tip: The front desk of the hotel will call a [private cab to take you to Universal, and the ride will cost you $10 one way. But a Mears cab you call yourself will get you there for about $7.50 if you want to save a few bucks. Yes, I would stay here again. Fairfield Inn is a good chain.

We stayed in the same hotel 2 years ago in which time the hotel has changed very little and if I'm being honest the hotel is starting to look like it needs freshening up. Having said this I would still strongly recommend it as when all said and done its a budget hotel and fills all the reqirements you could need from a holiday in Orlando. It is also worth getting a King suite as you get a fridge, lots more space a huge king size bed and 2 T.Vs so no fighting with the kids on what you want to watch (that is if you have any spare time and can find anything worth watching on American T.V!!) The following are the main hotel pros and cons, Pros, Free Breakfast (Will save you loads of money and time). Fridge in King suites (Again if you buy bread and filling from Walgreens will save big $$$). Huge king size bed. Location (only a two minute walk from I-drive and very quiet unlike all the hotels on I-drive which are next to the interstate). Great staff who are always on had to help. Nice pool and hot tub which never seemed busy. Free computer room. Cons, Looking a bit tired. Only 1 free shuttle bus going to Universal. Free drinks that were 24 hrs are now only available at selected times, Computers in computer room are very slow. Breakfast choice has been cutback. Prices in Orlando seem to of gone up a lot and you could end up spending serious money on food so be prepared, Disney is charging $8 - $12 per person for snacks. We packed ourselves up each day. All parks except Seaworld and Aquatica will let you take food in. We used Lynx buses to get round this time and didn't buy I-Ride tickets (Lynx go everywhere the I-Ride does and more beside so another way to save) Getting to Disney on Lynx worked ok but you must get up early to make the most of the day. Get the number 8 or 42 to Seaworld then the 50 to the Transfer centre next to Magic Kingdom you are the able to use Disneys free transport to any Disney park. We found it took at best one and a half hours from I-Drive to Disney parks depending on how well the transfers worked out. Food on I-drive is still good value Ci-Ci's pizza is very cheap ($5.99 Buffet) and there are discount coupons all over for 2 for 1. Chilli's do a 2 main meals and a starter for $20 and the food is very good. I can also recommend Golden Coral ($11.99 Buffet) and Sweet Tomatoes ($10.99 buffet) for value and the food is nice. Outback is the best we found but ribs for 4 will cost around \u00c2\u00a3100. We flew with Virgin Atlantic on their new Airbus A330-300 from Manchester the entertainment systems are very good (so much better than on the old 747s) Food is a bit better but still plenty of room to improve. To sum up if your going to Orlando and want to be right in the middle of things but want to keep costs down pick the Fairfield Inn but don't expect the Hilton.

From the moment we arrived the member of staff on shift (Francisco(sorry if I've spelt your name incorrectly!)) was very helpful and made us very welcome. We sorted out our safe box, which are kept behind the hotel reception, and settled into our room. We booked a suite and it came with a seating area, table and office style chair, a large bed a couple of flat screen TV's in the bed and seating area, a microwave, fridge and air conditioning (slightly noisy but very effective). There was also a mini sound system in the room. Everything was clean and tidy and, although slightly worn, still comfortable. There were only a handful of hangers on arrival so a quick word with the maid the following day saw another10 arrive which was plenty. There was a iron and ironing board in the room and the hair dryer was good according to the wife (not much need for it in my case). The breakfast area during our stay was always clean and tidy with staff constantly cleaning the serving areas. The choices were good for us as we are not really fried/cooked breakfast lovers so serial, toast, pastries, yoghurt, bagels, fruit and self cook waffles were ample for us. These came with jams, peanut butter, honey and syrup as required. We always got what we wanted every day and there was always a place to sit either inside or outside. There is also a selection of juices available. We tried the orange, cranberry and apple and all were good. There is also a selection of coffee, tea and hot chocolate available 24x7 which is on a self service basis. This was great for a coffee sat outside after an evening out. The pool area is adequate for a short swim and cooling off. On our visit in September the pool was not crowded and there was plenty of room. Similarly the hot tub was also available. Towels are available from the pool area to use. The gym is really only cardio only and is a little limited for anyone wanting to do any weight training (no weights). The location of the hotel was ideal as there were many restaurants within a walk, i-Ride (more later) or taxi fare away. Our favourite was The Olive Garden which is a good quality Italian chain restaurant. We went to the one on International Drive but there are several around. We also dined at Kobe which is a Japanese Teppanyaki restaurant where the show from the chefs is equal to the food quality. Other restaurants in close proximity are TGI Fridays, Chilli's, Cici's (a bit fast food for me but the rest of our party liked it) and the typical giants are all there such as Mac's, Burger King, Denny's etc... I-Ride proved to be a bit of a struggle. The service was irregular and when they did arrive they were normally full with no chance to get a seat. Several times we abandoned the bus stop and nominated a driver for the car or got a taxi. Next time I would not bother and either go for the taxi or the local Lynx bus service which is scheduled and regular. With regard to the parks the hotel was easily accessible to the Universal theme parks as a bus runs to Universal and Island of Adventures on a daily basis. We had a car so didn't use this service. We spoke to some others in the hotel without a car and they had some difficulty in getting to the Disney side of things. We didn't try this so cannot really verify this. Wet and Wild is a walk away and we had a great time there! Overall we had a great time in Orlando. We did lots of things not normally available to us in the UK such as airboat rides, shooting a .45 calible gun, swimming with dolphins and rays, walking through swamps ( big spiders...!)...the list goes on and on.

I usually stay at the Marriott properties closer to Disney in the Lake Buena Vista area. I found an excellent point-saver value at the Fairfield Inn off I-Drive so I decided to take a chance given the Marriott Points value. My first choice of the Marriott Brands for a vacation stay is always the Residence Inn or Spring Hill Suites due to the good hot breakfast. I was not overjoyed at staying at the Fairfield due to the more continental style breakfast as opposed to the hot breakfast. However, I was reading great reviews of the breakfast at the I-Drive location (egg sandwiches and such.). The check-in process was smooth--they identified me as a Platinum member. Front desk staff was always friendly. I did think it was odd that the male front-desk employee frequently had a group of 4-5 ladies (seemed like his cousins or something) standing by the front desk eating ice cream and chatting with him every night. I liked that the hotel had the WSJ out every morning in the lobby. The pool/hot tub area was nice. Nothing fancy (better pool at the Marriott Suites location) but fine. The pool water was WAY too hot--it was like jumping into a bath tub. Not refreshing. The room was great. We had a king suite. The bed was comfortable. We liked the layout--a sitting area plus a bedroom area. It was nice having a fridge and microwave for dinner leftovers. The one thing we did not like about the room was that it felt humid/damp unless we had the AC running 24/7. The hotel was very close to the Universal parks and not as far as we thought from the Disney parks. We took I-4 to the Disney parks and were there in about 15 min. Not bad. There are also some very good restaurants on Sand Lake that are near by. We highly recommend the Orlando Ale House as well for cheap food and drinks that are very delicious. Also, the Chilis (within walking distance) has happy hour all day every day so we had drinks and apps for next to nothing. The main downside to this hotel was the Breakfast, as I had feared. The great egg sandwiches I had heard about on Trip Advisor were no where to be found. If you love carbs for breakfast, the Fairfield Inn breakfast can't be beat. Bagels, Toast, Cereals, Waffles, Danish, Donuts, Fruit. However, my husband and I like to eat protien for breakfast and the best we could do is to put peanut butter on our fruit or waffle and eat a low-fat yogurt. We ended up paying for breakfast several mornings because we don't think carb-loading is a healthy way to start the day. At least the Fairfield Inn in the Marriott Village had hard-boiled eggs--that would be a welcome addition to the breakfast at the I-Drive location. Overall, I prefer the Lake Buena Vista area to the I-Drive area so I do not think I would be staying at the hotel again. However, for the points we paid, we had a great stay and if you are looking for a hotel in the Universal Area you will enjoy staying here.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ks", "Title": "\u201cDecent, inexpensive lodging\u201d", "Author": "ks-bike-rider", "ReviewID": "UR118285561", "Content": "This is a typical Fairfield Inn.

CVS in the parking lot too - so you are never really stranded without food, snacks, or necessities. The IRide trolley was great too - there was a stop for it right in front of TGIFridays and we took it daily to the convention center. Very cheap and convenient.

When you first enter your room there is a really strong, disgusting, musty smell. I am sure its because of the humidity. But I suspect they dont really air out the rooms too well. -The towels in the bathroom are embarassingly thin and old feeling. -They do not give new small shampoo and conditioners after you use them. -The furniture in the hotels are REALLY old and dingy. I really didnt wanna sit on the chairs and the beds kinda scared me. -We only went down for breakfast one day. The selections are extremely limited. The only thing that was hot was the one waffle maker. I dont even think they had a toaster for bread. -There were bags of trash left in the hallway all day. Overall it was a medicore hotel.

Breakfast quality was a joke, and breakfast plates were even smaller, as if they wanted people to simply sniff the food. \"Small plates do not reduce waste\". Front desk response-- this is all that Marriott provided them. Lie-- I am a Marriott member and have traveled many places in FL alone. The hotel is perhaps thriving on foreigners who may not have tried other properties. A few blocks away on the International drive is the Residence Inn (Convention Ctr.)-- better in service, and overall value-- though that place was not new either. At least the breakfast, pool areas, and staff were much friendlier even in the high season (we stayed there a week earlier). Rooms had lousy sloppy beds which could easily give you muscle aches, if you do not get them from some of the wild rides in the park in Disney or Universal. Spare a few extra dollars of look further away, then letting these guys cash on the locations-- Hundreds of places are around the vicinity-- do a bit of Homework.

The water pressure is excellent in the shower. The pool was medium sized and not very crowded. Next to the pool was a covered area with table & chairs.

Location is good also, you can walk to universal it took about 20 mins or free bus leaves at 08.00 which is ideal if you want to be first on the rides,a taxi from universal cost between $6 to $8. And within walking distance are tgi, chillies,miller ale house etc The hotel also offers free wifi perfect for iphone ,ipads etc Overall we did'nt have one complaint over our two weeks and would definitely return to this Hotel", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat service and at a very reasonable price\u201d", "Author": "neno1203", "ReviewID": "UR115284787", "Content": "I normally don't bother writing reviews even though I should always do it.

On arrival we were checked in promptly and quickly arrived in our room. We had a king suite which was accompanied with a fridge, coffee machine and sitting area. Room was of a good size and bed very comfy. Quiet and peaceful considering a busy vacation time in Orlando. Breakfast was served from 5-10 am every morning with plenty of selection. The breakfast area is big and can seat around 60 per time but I suggest getting there early if you dont want to be over crowded! Cereals, fruits, pastries, egg and bacon roll, yoghurt, fruit juices and many more. Enough to get you going for the day as well as save you money on eating out for breakfast. Hotel does a free shuttle to Universal/Islands of Adventure. The pick up times are 6:50 am and 8:00 am and then there are 3 pick up times for return (they are quite late at night though). Just wait in the foyer for the big yellow shuttle bus and jump on. If you dont want to wait till 19:00 for the first pick up back to your hotel you can walk from the shuttle rank accross the bridge (crossing I4) and pick up the I-ride ( red line south) to stop 14 for quickness. We got a 14 unlimited ticket for the I-RIDE for $17 each which was very handy. It takes you to Sea World, Acquatica, Wet n Wild and both the Prime and premium outlets. From this hotel you are best to take the red line north and south to get up and down i-drive. No virgin rep in this hotel you have to walk to quality inn (5 mins) if you need to see the rep.

You can choose to go at 06:30 or approx 8AM and it does not return to pick you up until Half 6 at night.

Thought it was because they just cleaned. But the smell and the dampness never went away! The room smelled weird the whole stay. And before anyone says all hotel rooms in florida feel damp and musty we moved to another resort after this one and didn't have that issue at all. We have made several trips to Florida over the last 10 years and this was a first. The 3rd floor hallway even smelled. It was very off putting. 2.The laundry room was a mess. HOT! No air in there left the room too hot. Out of the 4 dryers only 2 worked properly and the hot water didn't work on the washing machines. 3. The breakfast was so so. I have seen better and I have seen worse. 4. Didn't use the pool or pool area. 5. The hotel is nice and close to Universal Studios. Close to lots of dining also.

The rooms were big, nicely decorated, with a big bathroom and confortable beds. The breakfast was good, the accomodations were nice, and most of all, the staff was great ! They answered all our questions, told us how to go to Universal Studios or the Airport and how long it would take. But mostly, they've been really great with my forgotten camera. I left this expensive camera in my room and only realized it when we were at the airport, 90 minutes prior boarding. I called them immediatly, so upset about it, and they've managed to calm me down and they tried their best to send me a cab with my camera. When they realized they couldn't do that, they told me they would send it right away back to my home in France, by FedEx. I've received my package quickly and they had taken a great care of it ! My camera was bubblewrapped, put in a box which was also bubblewrapped, and there were a lot of \"Fragile\" stickers everywhere on the box. I don't take such a good care of my camera myself !

My first bad trip advisor recommended stay!!\u201d", "Author": "zaezae", "ReviewID": "UR94613043", "Content": "I don't know how my experience was SO different, but here's an account of how we liked this property. I regularly travel for work and regularly choose Fairfield Inn & Suites properties so I was ecstatic to see this hotel rated so high on trip advisor. I was travelling with my 3 yr old, hubby and 2 sets of grandparents to Orlando for a family vacation. The rate was O.k. at $94.00 per night. Keep in mind this is the major off season for Orlando, so consider that as well. When we arrived to the hotel at around midnight there was someone out front talking on a cell phone. We entered the lobby and there was not a desk attendant. Three people were waiting to make purchases from the 'marketplace' and we needed to check in. Turned out, the guy outside on the phone was the attendant. He was not in any type of uniform, didn't have a name tag or any way to distinguish he was an employee. He kept us waiting while he finished his phone conversation outside and then we waited while he helped all the guests wanting to buy food, THEN he helped us. We weren't able to get rooms on the same floor which was a dissapointment, but that's o.k. I was given room 420 and told there was a crib. My son is 3.5 and very tall. No way did I want or need a crib. He told me that I reserved it (I assured him I didn't) but I did request a fridge. He said he would ask housekeeping to replace the crib with a fridge (which never happened). When we got to the room, my bad feelings were intensified. The room was dank and smelled musty at best. The air condition was running but it didn't seem to do much to cool the room or remove the humidity. The furnishings are so outdated it's laughable and there is NO counter space to speak of. Our room was SO small that with the crib in the room, there was ZERO floor space. This might have been o.k. if we were travelling with an infant, but we didn't even want or need the crib. I made the mistake of sitting in the chair in the room also. It was coated with at least an inch thick of dust and dirt and it smelled awful. Stale smoke more than lingered in the air even though I was assured this was a non-smoking hotel. I called down to inquire about the condition of the room and I was told that all the rooms were the same, but I could get a different one if I wanted. Since it was after midnight and I needed to get my 3 year old to bed, I made a bad decision to stick with that room. I went down to buy a water and the desk attendent proceeded to tell me that he knows the hotel is old. He said that it had been in bankruptcy status until about 1 month ago, basically offerring that as an excuse for the poor state of the property. The bed & mattress were awful. The bedding was so old it was horrible. The bed itself was so terrible it should have been replaced long ago. We all rolled to the middle all night and didn't sleep a wink. It was so soft and lumpy it wasn't even fit for my toddler. The 'breakfast' also left much to be desired. I will compliment them on the hours though, they offer breakfast from 6:30-10am which is pretty generous. This is the only compliment you will find. The breakfast area is crowded making it impossible to walk between tables when they are occupied and it's also across from the 'game room' causign my son to be intrigued by that rather than want to eat. Although the choices to eat left much to be desired. The juice tasted very cheap and the other options were super limited. I would have rather eaten the junk they serve at McDonalds.

We used the business center to print out our Disney's Magic Kingdom Christmas Party tickets, without a charge. There were vending machines on the floors, as well as a small shop at the front desk to buy soda and water etc. Which we found useful on our first day, No overcharge.

A major plus point for offering complimentary newspapers in the lobby, tea/coffee machine in the breakfast room all day and night and FREE wi-fi internet connection in-room and around the hotel and 2 PC stations with printers in the business centre on the ground floor. Rooms were very clean and good size - A/C, although a bit noisy was easy to control. Could have done with an in-room safe but overall the hotel felt safe. The staff were pleasant and helpful whenever we came in to contact with them but there was no porter service which would have been very welcome with a pregnant wife! The pool was clean, well maintained and not busy. Also had plenty of sun loungers, complimentary towels, cold shower and a spa. There is no life guard at any time. Eating wise, there is no restaurant or room service in the hotel, but there was a small shop which sells basic snacks and drinks. There really is no need for a restaurant as you can get takeaway delivered from several well known food chains to your room. Also, within a 5 min walk, there is a TGI, Popeye's Chicken, Perkins and a fish restaurant and a McD's.

We arrived mid afternoon and check-in was really quick and easy. Chris checked us in and was very helpful. Got our room request of top floor - room 536. Room was big and spacious, 2 good sized double beds, desk with phone and chair, plenty of drawers etc. Bathroom was good sized with shower over bath and toilet. Good space outside the bath with sink, big mirror, hairdyrer and room for cosmetics. First impressions were that the room was clean and perfect for us! Got to say I am not quite sure where a rollaway bed would go! We did not notice any smell at all that others having been referring to. The breakfast is great - milk, orange juice and usually one other (apple or cranberry), loads of cereals (all kelloggs!!), bagels, muffins, bread, toasters (2), fruit, yoghurts, microwave ham and egg sandwiches, pastries and cakes. Really busy during July but we got a table every morning bar one when we sat outside. The free Wifi in the room is a total bonus and it works well. If you don't have a laptop or Ipod with you, there are 2 PC's next to the lobby which give free internet access. If busy, they are limited to 15 mins and you just politely inform whoever is on this that this is the policy. The staff is what makes this hotel what it is. They are very helpful and go out of their way to help you. Chris and Laura on reception are first class and the housekeeping kept our room spotless all holiday! We asked for a fridge when we checked in and were put on a waiting list - we got it delivered to our room the next day!! We had a light bulb out in our room, told Laura, it was fixed within minutes - you can't ask for better than that! The hotel is on Canada Ave, literally mins from International Drive (cut across the grass and wee bridge next to the pub and you come out at Cici's pizza). The road is very quiet and away from the hussle of I-Drive. I don't recalling having to yield (give way) to any car when leaving the hotel. I agree strongly with the other reviewers about the junction of Sand Lake Road and Canada Ave - it is a nightmare!! The drivers are so rude and completely block the road even though they can see you are sitting waiting! Try going right out of the hotel and either go left and left again to go along I-Drive or go right and right and come along Universal Bld and turn left onto Sand Lake Road (both have lights which make it quicker). We hired a car for the 2 weeks and it was great. Go to universal after 6pm as parking is only $3. Recommended shops to go to include Premium Outlets at the top of I-Drive and the Florida Mall. The Mall at Millenia is a bit posh and Prime outlets are not as good as Premium. Restaurants I would recommend are Cici's pizza, ponderosa, olive garden and perkins. Overall, we loved staying here and it is the perfect place to stay - comfy beds, great rooms, fantastic staff and close to the parks!

We arrived at the hotel at around 4PM and when I inquired about AAA, I received a lower rate than was quoted online. We had a queen bed in a corner with pullout for our son in the living area. The room was very clean and roomy. We liked the fact that the sink area was outside the bathroom and the bathroom had a continuously running fan. The room had two big TVs, microwave and a refrigerator. We had to be at the Sports Complex early everyday, so the free breakfast from 6:30-10 every morning was a BIG plus for us. The breakfast selection was huge. The breakfast staff was constantly putting out food, wiping down the tables and answering questions for the guest. Had two big flat screen TVs to watch while you ate . I also like the fact that they had Purell hand sanitizer stations around the breakfast area for those who wanted to use them. My husband would say every morning that he didn't se how the hotel made any money with the breakfast that they \"gave away\" every day. When the staff would clean our room everyday (they did a fabulous job) they would leave 3 sets of towels, but we always needed an extra set because we wanted to refresh after having been out in the Florida heat all day, so I would inquire about extra towels before going up to our room and no sooner had we closed the door, house keeping would be knocking with the extra towels! The hotel was very clean, 100% smoke-free. Every morning when we got off the elevator for breakfast there was the USA Today AND The Wall Street Journal stacked for anybody who wanted to take them! A big plus for me since I don't travel with an internet phone or laptop. We stayed on the 2nd floor and never had any issues with noise overhead or anything. We never used the outdoor pool, but did walk by a couple of times and noticed that it looked kind of small. The area where the hotel is located is surrounded by restaurants and shops. The grounds were very well maintained and nicely landscaped. You would always see people out walking. Felt very comfortable in the neighborhood. The only complaint we had with our visit, was that it was often difficult to exit Canada Dr. onto Sand Lake because cars would block the exit and traffic was constantly backed up, but when we got out, we were on our way in no time.

We stayed in this hotel for 3 weeks from middle of April 2010 to mid May 2010, having booked it through Virgin Holidays. Overall I would say this is a good value for money hotel. It is not a 5 star hotel (or even 4 star) so don't stay here if your expecting 4 or 5 star quality. Firstly ALL staff were excellent. e.g. on our first day we were heading out to Denny's for breakfast and stopped at reception to ask if we could have a fridge put in the room. After returning from breakfast (1hr later) they had already put it in the room!! we were astounded how quick they were, and this excellent service was repeated continously throughout the stay. 10/10 for service. I actually found the hotel to be very quiet for the whole 3 weeks. In fact the only time it seemed busy was at breakfast, and still there was no problem getting seated and fed (indeed the breakfasts were an excellent alternative from the numerous diners (they offer cereals, fruit, various pastries, juices, coffees, bagels etc.). It is a help your self service, and therefore whilst it's obviously not the ritz, it is still excellent value therefore I would rate 8/10. Rooms were adequate, providing us with everything we needed (fridge, tv, iron, hair dryer, good shower free wi fi), and the room was clean and tidy (the maids did an excellent job every day). The only MINOR issue I would say would be that there was a slight \"smell\" in the room, which whilst not being aweful, was noticeable every time I stepped into the room, however this was easily remedied by buying an air freshner from the local grocery store, as well as leaving the window open. Rooms were also a good enough standard, and all fixtures and fittings were in an acceptable condition (not brand new, but what do you expect in a hotel on international drive in orlando!!!!!). I would therefore rate the rooms 7/10. I would rate location 10/10 as it is is superbly located just of international drive. We found canada avenue to be a very quiet road, with MINIMAL traffic on, and it felt very safe (we never once saw or heard any trouble at all). Whilst we had a car, we walked to restaurants of an evening (at various times of day/night). TGI is literally 4 minute walk away (excellent), Chillis (excellent food and had bogof drinks) is 7 minute walk away, dennys is 11 minute walk away, bahama breeze is 25 minute walk away, and pointe orlando is 30 minte walk away . There must be another 50+ retaurants easily within 20 minute walk away, but the ones noted are where we enjoyed. We also enjoyed playing mini golf (20mins walk away) and go-karting (10 min walk away). Wet and wild is also 15-20 min walk away. Shuttel bus leaves at 8.30ish which takes you free to islands of adventure/universal and comes back around 6, we didnt use, but we saw people using it on a daily basis without any hassle. It also cost us $8 + $2 tip for a taxi to and from City Walk (MEARS TAXI!!!), again all times of day and night so felt very safe and secure. Hotel had a security guard and porter on when we went past at 12am and 2am and 5am, so always felt that it was a safe environment.. We had the use of a free security depopsit box at reception, there is a cash machine (max withdrawal per day is $200) and small shop to buy some groceries, and as much coffee as you can drink (24 hrs a day). Pool was amply sized with only a hadful of people using it. Finally Pirates dinner is literally right next door so 3 minutes away (although we went and will defintely NOT be going again as once you paid your admission, you then have to buy a \"souvenier\" mug to drink your first alcoholic drink from - COMPLETE joke!!! $14 for 1 drink). Overall I cannot really fault this hotel, both myself and my wife would quite happily stay here again, and would have no issues recommending it anybody else!! Yes we have stayed in better hotels, but for the price range for this is definetly amazing value for money. THIS IS A GREAT HOTEL!!!

I stay at a lot of Marriott properties (platinum member), and this Fairfield Inn is far from the best of that brand. First, I agree with the reviewers here that the staff are friendly and will help you quickly. I also think that the onsite amenities are good for families (game room with pool table and video games, hotel convenience market, outdoor pool). The breakfast area is gigantic by Fairfield Inn standards so seating wasn't a problem. I did have some trouble getting my desired room choice at check in, because this hotel is a favorite of groups coming to see the Orlando sights. There were several groups there on the night I checked in and various groups came and went over the three nights I stayed at the property. LOTS of kids, of all ages, and yes, they hang out in the hallways. The room I started with was on the first floor (only room available with two beds for that night). The next day I was moved to a higher floor and a quieter end of the hotel, but the room layout was identical. Both rooms were clean but the furnishings, carpet etc. were dated and looked a little worn. Tube tvs. The beds had latex foam mattresses and plenty of pillows, I slept well on nights 2 and 3 (kid noise on night 1). Overall not a bad place, but definitely geared more towards groups and families with kids, so independent travelers might feel overrun by the masses, and the rooms have a \"motel\" kind of feel.

You don't even have to drive there, it's literally a 5-10 minute walk if you need to get something quickly before you head out. The actual hotel was great. Free breakfast, free internet, heated pool, extremely relaxing hot tub, all made it a great place to stay. We stayed in a King Suite so there was plenty of room for just the two of us. There is also complementary coffee and tea in the lobby if you ever want some. The staff was very helpful and assisted us with anything we needed. The cleaning service was great as well. There was one day where we left our room really late after denying the initial cleaning run with the privacy notice on the front door, surprisingly we still came back to a clean room. The hotel also has a market where you can buy snacks and drinks and a free computer room to browse the internet if you don't happen to have a laptop. My only real problems with the hotel while we stayed were a early fire scare we had where the building had to be evacuated. Turns out it was nothing so everyone went back up to their rooms. There were also a few summer camps staying at the hotel so the free morning breakfast was very crowded. We decided to visit Universal Studios during our trip, but we weren't driving so we had to rely on cabs everyday. If you're not driving you definitely want to use the Yellow Cab Service. The ride to Universal from the hotel is about $7-$8. All other cab services were trying to charge us $12-$15. There was one in particular called CBC, where we called ahead of time and the dispatcher told us 5 minutes..we ended up waiting 45! Just stick with Yellow Cab service. :) Even with the fire scare and crowded breakfast service, everything was handled extremely professionally and efficiently.

The only con to this hotel that was all the drawers smelled like they had been cleaned with a dirty sponge (they had that nasty moldy smell) and every time housekeeping cleaned, the room stunk of ammonia and we had to leave the window open. We actually switched rooms right when we got there because the first room's dresser drawers smelled moldy. The second room had the same problem, though, so we gave up and dealt with it. Luckily, our room had two queen beds so we slept in one and laid out our clothes on the other. Housekeeping must have thought we were nuts. We complained to the front desk about the odor, so hopefully they'll have changed their cleaning products. Besides the odor, the room was spotless and everything else was great. Everyone I spoke to at the front desk was extremely helpful and really nice. Our last day there, check-out was at 11am, but our plane didn't leave until 6pm. The front desk offered to hold our luggage free of charge so we could enjoy a little more time at the parks before we had to leave. Breakfast was good, a little bit better than standard continental. Plenty of healthy options like fruit along with a nice selection of cereals, oatmeal, danishes, toast, and muffins. There was a small convenience store located in the hotel, which came in very handy for drinks and whatnot. The pool was amazing. It was perfectly heated and spotless. The bed was very comfortable, the TV worked fine, the shower was nice and big with plenty of hot water and a very nice shower-head. The view from our room on the 5th floor was very nice. We overlooked a pond and the pool, and in the distance we could see the roller coasters and spotlights from Universal. There was tea, coffee, and hot chocolate constantly available, with plenty of coupons for nearby restaurant and attractions. CiCi's Pizza was definitely the cheapest place to eat. For two people, it was about $12 for all you can eat pizza, pasta, salad, and drinks. Sweet Tomatoes was nearly as cheap (but much better for you) and just a few blocks away, clocking in at about $14 for two people. When we just wanted to stay in after a long day at the parks, the girl at the front desk was able to recommend several restaurants that delivered to our room. As far as location goes, this hotel was perfect! We didn't rent a car, and I don't think we needed to at all. There are tons of restaurants and attractions within walking distance. It was about a 20 minute walk to Universal, and about a three minute walk across a vacant lot to International Drive. From there, we were able to buy I-Ride passes and take the trolley to Seaworld, Wet and Wild, the shopping outlets, Wonderworks, and all the mini-golf places in the area. The hotel provided a shuttle to Universal that we used a few times, but it was nice to know if we stayed later at a club, the cab ride back was only $6.

Within a couple of minutes you're right on International Drive with a multitude of places to eat, but even so, it's in such a quiet location.

You can hire out a safety deposit box from the front desk for the duration of your stay free of charge, which is a bonus.

The sofa bed did have the kids rolling together by morning, but they were so shattered they didn't mind! The room was cleaned to perfection every day, with towels replaced if needed. We asked for an extra blanket for the sofabed and within minutes someone was at the door with one for us. The facilities were great. We didn't check out the pool as the weather was a tad cold, so can't comment on that. There is a laundry with two washing machines $1 a go (4 quarters) - bargain! There are also four dryers which again cost $1. You can buy washing powder in the shop for $1 too. The shop is small but has all the essentials you need. There are complementary copies of USA Today and the Wall Street Journal available every morning in the lobby. There is a gym but we didn't try that out - walking round parks all day was all the exercise we needed. There are also two computers available - free of charge - there is a courtesy limit of 15 minutes use at a time, but you can extend this if no-one else is waiting. Breakfast was a real grab-and-go affair but perfect when you need to get up early and get off to the parks. There was fruit juice - usually orange and apple but sometimes cranberry plus fresh water and milk; a good selection of cereals including oatmeal; several bakery items for toasting such as bread, bagels, muffins and pancakes; breakfast sandwich type things which you heat in the microwave; danish pastries and muffins; fresh fruit. Along with that there is tea and coffee, hot chocolate and a selection of fruit/herbal teas which is available 24/7. There is no problem taking food up to your rooms and we even had a pizza delivered to our room by a local pizzeria recommended by the front desk.

The hotel was perfect for what we wanted. The first room I was assigned unfortunately had a too strong a perfumed smell but I was changed immediately with no questions asked and by a very apolegtic front desk. The next room was perfect, clean and very roomy. I saw one review complaining about the free breakfast. Firstly it is free!! Generally hotels in this area are bed only, you have to pay huge amount for breakfast or go out trying to find a breakfast. The breakfast had plenty of choice, fruit juices, cereals, fruit, toast, bagels, pastries, tea and coffee, I mean what more do you want for a FREE breakfast?? This hotel doesn't have a bar but its only 5 mins walk to a TGI Fridays or Chilis on the main international drive. The big advantage of this hotel is that you can walk 5 mins to a bar and then walk back, both of you being able to drink, lovely! I cannot recommend this hotel enough as it was perfect for what we needed, When you go to Orlando you are at the parks all day, so when you come back to our hotel all you want is a clean, good sized room and friendly hotel staff - this is all at the Fairfield. A tip for dining, go further down international drive towards the convention centre and the Castle hotel. There is a small shopping plaza with shops and restaurants. We dined at the Oceanaire seafood restaurant at this plaza. Yes its expensive but sooo worth it, perfect for a romantic meal for two. I am not huge seafood fan but this food was divine - go to it for that one special night during your stay, you will not regret it.", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kent", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "pompomKent", "ReviewID": "UR56988160", "Content": "stayed at the fairfield with our 2 grandaughters. breakfast very good well stocked at all times and clean staff very friendly and helpful good location even if you do not have a car have been visiting orlando since 1991 and this is one of the best hotels we have stayed we even got our room request.", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cFriendly service at a great little hotel\u201d", "Author": "Ms.Travels", "ReviewID": "UR56823156", "Content": "I recently enjoyed a quick overnight stay while traveling through Orlando.

It's ideally situated as it is on a road that runs parallel to International Drive so you have all the facilities (shops & restaurants) on International Drive within walking distance but without the traffic - you can use Universal Boulevard to drive to the parks & attractions instead. The continental breakfast is superb - plenty to choose from (juice, pastries, fruit, yoghurt, toast, bagels, microwaveable hot breakfast muffins etc) so you can fill yourself up before a big day at the parks. And there is coffee/tea/hot chocolate to help yourself to all day every day in the dining area. The pool area is nice and there are fresh towels available at the poolside. The jacuzzi was VERY hot when we were there so be warned - you may not last too long in there on a hot day! We made use of the laundry facilities this time and were so glad we did - it only cost a few dollars to do all our washing & drying while we used the pool (washing powder etc is sold in the hotel shop) and we came back home with cases full of clean clothes. The staff were incredibly friendly and always spoke as we walked past the front desk. You could use the safety deposit boxes behind the front desk for no extra charge which was ideal for storing passports & money etc. I would recommend 'Chili's' restaurant just round the corner - it get's very busy so be prepared for a wait but it's worth it.

Service from the front of house staff was excellent and very friendly, nothing was a trouble to them and they would spend time chatting with you making you feel very welcome. The housekeeping staff we had were particularly good and paid attention to detail. Bed linen was changed on request as were the bath towels. One maid in particular who we spoke with noticed my wife was having trouble with blisters on her heel from wearing new shoes. The next day upon returning to our room she had left out an assortment of plasters and a bottle of water for my wife, very thoughtful. It was the small touches of the fanned out the box of tissues left on our bed that made you know that you were being taken care of by professional staff. Access to the hotel was secure and you were comfortable about safety. The rooms themselves were clean and fresh and bright. The pool was small but never crowded, clean and warm water was inviting for the rest days. The hot tub was just that, 105F and you are recommended not to spend more that 15 minutes at a time in it an a clock was positioned conveniently for you to keep an eye on your time. Towels were provided free at the pool deck which enabled you to dry off before coming back into the lobby area. The dining area for breakfast was kept clean and coffee was available 24hrs. Breakfast ranged from toast, boiled eggs, pancakes / waffles syrup, yogurts and fresh fruit. A good selection but if having a longer stay might get a bit monotonous and a visit to a local Dennys etc will be a welcome change. Free parking and an ideal location made getting about by care easy. Bus service was available to and from the parks, however one family who we talked to ended up hiring a car locally as the journey took an hour because of stops at other hotels. Our journey by car took 10 min to Universal parking lot. If I were staying at the north end of I Drive I would not hesitate in going back to the Fairfiled. I think that the two star should be at least 3 or 3.5 My reason for not going to 4 is the lack of a bar / lounge or full restaurant. I can understand why there is not bar as it maintained a quite environment and there was no rowdiness, however a place to have a drink or two and chat with friends would have been nice as our normal day would be up early and quite busy and it would be normal for most nights to be back by 9pm to relax in our room and watch some local TV news of which there is plenty.

We booked the hotel having read all the great reviews it received, so we had high expectations when we arrived - delightfully we were not dissapointed and it was even better than we imagined. The staff are so friendly and helpful and make you really feel at home throughout your stay. The rooms are excellent - 2 queen size beds which are really comfortable, a great shower, and of course a TV with a great selection of channels. We had taken our laptop along and were able to make use of the free Wi-fi!!!! Pool is excellent never overcrowded, breakfast was great, saves time meaning you can get to the parks early to beat the crowds. The hotel location is perfect just one street behind the hustle and bustle of I-Drive making it lovely and quiet in the evenings, but not too far to be able to walk to many restaurants/shops etc. We enjoyed having dinner at TGI fridays where we were able to get steak dinners for about $8 each, and the staff there were excellent!!! If you are getting a flex ticket, then the location is ideal, all the parks (except busch gardens on the flex plus) are within 15mins drive of the hotel and very easy to get to, there is also a wallmart near by which is amazing for souvenirs and snacks. If anyone is considering driving and thinking about hiring a Sat Nav, we actually found it worked out cheaper for us to purchase a map upgrade (\u00c2\u00a350) for our own unit instead of hiring one from the hire car company which cost a great deal more. We also took the Virgin platinum insurance on the car hire which gave us great peace of mind and made for a very quick hand over when we arrived. Ok so I will say no more except if you are thinking of booking this hotel - Do it, you wont be dissapointed.

The air con units are a tad noisy, but you get used to it, especially as you really need them at night in Aug/Sept. The beds were really comfy, bedding was new and clean and changed as often as you wanted and the housekeeping maid was thorough an efficient. The pool isn't huge, but was never busy and it was always warm and in direct sunlight. (except at night of course) The free breakfast does get a bit tedious after 3 weeks, but hey, its free and we quite often went out early and stopped of at Golden Corral or Ihop by way of a change. As has been stated, the hotel is in a quiet location, close to I drive and with free transport to and from Universal, altough we did not utilise this as we had a hire car.

We had a car and location wise the place is ideal. You're 10 minutes drive to Seaworld and less than 5 minutes from the I-4 (exit 74A) which gets you to Disneyworld in about 20 mins(exit 67 is best). The hotel is served by a free shuttle bus to universal which leaves at 08:20,9:20,10:20 each morning and returns at 4:10 and 7:20 each day. On thurs,fri,sat they do extra late buses for citywalk. My recommendations is to use the bus to get there and get a cab back(opposite where the bus drops you) from the rank. Cost us just $8 with tip to get back as the bus on the way back becomes a bit of a free for all (some people can't or don't queue). The pool was nearly empty for our 2 week stay and the deep end was just 5 feet so okay if you're not a good swimmer(like me). Also loads of free beds for sunbathing(if you get time !). Free breakfast is good with several cereals,fruit,danish,toast and jimmy dean muffins which i would not recommend unless you like soggy muffins. Free tea and coffee all day. Always tables available. The front desk changes up to $100 trav cheques a day and can supply a free box/safe for all your valuables on request which is held under the front desk. They are mega helpful and there wasn't a single time where i went to them for help be it directions or whatever that they didn't know the answer. There's a laundry on the ground floor if your towels etc get soaked with the rain showers..costs just 1 dollar for 30 minutes drying cycle.There's 2 pc's on the ground floor also with free internet access 24 hours a day.. Now the room..shower ,bed,cleanliness,TV,air con all excellent but the one thing that let it all down was the storage. For four of us. 2 adults and 2 teenagers for 2 weeks we had a open clothes rail about 3 feet long and 4 large drawers and one small bedside drawer. Because of this our room resembled a chinese laundry for the 2 weeks. I know it's 2 star but there was a desk and seat in the corner which could be taken out and replaced by a cupboard for clothes,this would be far more practical. So as we could have a drink we tried a few restaurants we could walk to in the area and the best by far was chilli's,Cici's pizza was good for the money..buffet pizza for 4 with drinks $28 !!! Ponderosa is good for the money too but is like eating in a canteen with no atmosphere. TGI's was okay,and the chinese buffet was okay too. International Drive is a bit tacky with loads of tourist shops which gave it a slight downmarket feel. A couple of nights we got some cans and bottles of wine and crisps and sat outside near the pool area and had a drink. I though they might stop us but nothing was said. Did that twice after epcot and magic kingdom where we got back just before midnight...i think that's it !! ooh..don't forget to tip the maid EVERY day. We left $3 or $4 a day..E-mail me if there's anything else you wanna know !!!...Joe", "Date": "September 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIT WAS A SUPERB STAY\u201d", "Author": "Natrull", "ReviewID": "UR39693124", "Content": "This was one of the best stays at a hotel that we have encountered.

If you are walking as we were, it's about a 5-10 minute walk to I-Drive. The area has many hotels and restaurants and feels very safe to walk in. The walk was much longer than I anticipated and was rather annoying towards the end of our stay. Check in at this hotel was very fast and simple. We had a King Suite for our stay for $109US/night. The room was a very nice size. Bed and sofa/living area were separated by a partial wall/closet. Also had 2 tvs, a fridge and microwave all of which were in good working order. Bathroom was clean and adequate. The free breakfast served each morning was delicious and always well stocked. Arrive early for best seating. We did not use the pool but it also seemed clean and not overly busy. We used the guest laundry as well and the washers and dryers worked very well. There are only 2 washers and 4 dryers. The only concern I have with this hotel is that they encourage you at check in to notify the front desk if you need a taxi which they will arrange for you. We did this the first day we arrived and ended up paying $40US for a return trip to Walmart on Turkey Lake Rd (about 10 mins away). The taxi service they use obviously has some sort of contract with the hotel. For the remainder of our stay we called Mears Yellow Cab and got much better service and rates.

The staff was very friendly and professional....even housekeeping staff seemed to have a smiles on their faces....nice. Breakfast was fine.....nothing hot except if you make your own oatmeal with packets or microwave a prepared packaged sausage/egg or sausage/ham biscuit. The latter item ran out every day prior to 9:30 am. There were plenty of pastries and muffins, typically orange juice and cranberry or apple juice, hard boiled eggs and cereal. There were a lot of folks there and I give Fairfield the credit for handling the large volume of folks. One of our five days, our room was not made up but that was because we got such a late start....probably after noon. There is internet in our room....we had a king suite....with two tv's and a sofabed....our kids are 3, 5 and 11 and each night one kid slept with Mom and Dad and the other two in the sofabed. We can only manage in this way for probably a couple more years. Now here is the kicker and the bit of bad news. On our final breakfast just before checking out, my wife thinks out loud about whether or not she should complain about the \"black mold\". I asked her what she meant and she felt the room smelled damp and musty....I did not notice. I went back to the room to check it out and snapped some photos of the sofabed and have no idea whether the spots on the underside of the mattress are mold spots or not. It is interesting to note that the spots largely occur where shiny metal touches the bottom of the mattress, particularly over the springs and over the spot in the middle where two cross rods add support. My thought is that perhaps the springs and rods have a higher chance of condensing room humidity vapor, in which case the black marks may be mold or rust stains.....not sure? In any case, on checkout, I showed a photo to the front desk staffer and told her about what we found. She apologized and said she would have the room checked out. Anyway, check out the attached pictures.....I really don't know what the heck they are?

We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night. We had a ground floor room and heard not a peep from our neighbors at night. The room although sparsely decorated was clean as a whistle. The beds were comfortable, not plush. We had 4 pillows on each double bed! The shower head was huge with multi-settngs, the water hot and the bathroom had plentiful soft thick towels.The air conditioning was cold and not overly noisey. We could've chosen a king suite which included a fridge and microwave but decided to pay $20 less since we planned to spend every minute at Universal and City Walk. The room was made up each day. We did eat breakfast at the hotel. The coffee was brewed just right(we drank the dark roast) and always available in the lobby. The breakfast was the usual fare ie hardboiled eggs, bagels, muffins, danish, cereals, even premade waffles and pancakes(the kids in the hotel went for these), yogurt and fresh fruit too, and all was well stocked. We had free in room wireless internet. The hotel also had a separate room on the ground floor with 2 computers available for public access, and often in use, we noticed. The pool and jacuzzi were heated and open from 6am til 11pm. We hoped to use the jacuzzi in the evening but unfortunately a lot of other people had the same plan. The security guard locked up on schedule. The hotel is very close to Wet and Wild and my husband clocked it a mile from the Universal entrance, and yet very quiet. We took a route to Universal using the short back road on Carrier street which intersects Universal Blvd, so its practically impossible to get lost and the area seems very safe. The hotel provides a free shuttle to Universal but it runs only at specific times, so be sure to ask for these. The area surrounding the hotel has great restaurants..see trip advisor restaurant reviews. We noticed that Seasons 52 is minutes away as well as Cafe TuTu(artsy with entertainment), and Texas de Brasil. If you have money to spend, try making a reservation at Texas de Brasil...it has an amazing salad bar and they freshly carve meats at your table..an all you can eat place..not cheap($45/pp), but memorable. We noticed a line outside of the Pirates Dinner Theatre when we were on our way out for the evening and wish we had time planned to try it too...it would be a leisurely short walk from the hotel. On the morning of our departure we noticed that the hotel also has a game room area with pool table and arcade games. It would've been fun to play a game of pool if we had had more time. The hotel also has a covered patio area with tables and seating, and we sat out late one evening talking and enjoyed the night air.

I can now see why it is such a favourite. It is in a perfect location, situated just slightly back from International Drive so no noise and heavy traffic. As it is in the middle of International Drive it is a great location for both the more upscale end and the cheap and cheerful!! We also found that Sand Lake road that the hotel is off is fab because one way you get straight onto the motorway to Disney & the other way takes you to the Florida Mall. When we arrived at the hotel we were told that they did not have any notice of our booking. This immediately worried us but they sorted it in a matter of minutes (Virgin had confirmed our booking with them as being for May not March!!!) We had a lovely spacious room on the 4th floor whch was plenty big enough for two of us with two double beds, a comfy chair, desk and chair, t.v, drawers & hanger space. The bathroom was a fair size and was nice as the basin was in a separate vanity area so two people could get ready at the same time. The only thing I didn't really like was the fact that although there is a covering on the windows and net curtains so you can't see in the actual curtains were only there for display & did not meet in the middle. I am a heavy sleeper so it didn't bother me but some people may find this disturbing. The facilities at the hotel were also brilliant. We were able to store all our valuables (phone, passport, money etc) in the storage boxes at the front desk. I was a bit unsure at first about not having a safe in my room, but it worked out really well. We just asked at the desk for our stuff as we were going out for the day so we knew to take what we needed. The staff were all really helpful, and as you have the only key to the safe & they ask for your signature to open it I felt everything was secure. We used the business suite for the internet most days just to check up on stuff. You get 15 mins per session which we found plently long enough. Sometimes it was busy but we just went back when we felt it would be quieter. We also used the pool area once - plenty of loungers, clean towels (we used our own as we didn't relise these were avaiable) & the pool itself ws lovely and clean & warm. We also bought a few bits in the hotel shop when we couldn't be bothered to walk to international drve (it's not that far we were being lazy!!) which we found wasn't too badly priced. We also used the free shuttle to Universal which was great (especially as on a Thurs-Sat night it comes back late from City Walk) we didn't have to worry about parking and could also get our bearings of the area whilst on the bus. Coming back it was running a little bit late but we had no other plans so that was fine. The breakfast was great for a freebie. Plenty of choice. I mainly stuck to cinamon buns or bagels, but there were plently of cereals, pastries, etc to keep you going. Although the breakfast area is relatively small there were always tables available with some people choosing to sit in the pool area to eat. I was very impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel, the rooms were immaculately clean even when we'd dumped our shopping bags everywhere the cleaned round them so it didn't look like a bomb hit the place!!!!

I always have a rental car so I can't comment on the park shuttles from this property although I did see several guests returning & leaving on shuttles through out the day. Rooms- Hotels in Orlando are used & abused since they are booked nearly year round. I imagine it's difficult to keep any property looking brand new. These rooms were clean but could use some updating in the decor. Overall room size was generous with a sitting area and desk. Bathroom was tiny and showed some wear & tear. Staff & Other Stuff- Free breakfast is great and such a money saver - especially in a town where everything is so over priced. Staff was really helpful and gracious with all my business requests. Free Wi-fi (that actually works) is always important to a business traveler. The property grounds aren't especially scenic or resorty but there is a pool on site. Overall, you can do a lot worse in Orlando. It's a good value - especially when contrasted to the Disney properties which are insanely over priced. Would I stay there again - maybe.

Blizzard Beach water park $37 adult, $31 child. Wal-Mart address-[--]. -Looking for Disney stuff...Orlando Wal-Mart has a large section of Disney licensed items to choose, some of the exact same items that we saw in the Disney shops for about 1/2 price. *FYI...If you go to Animal Kingdom make sure you do the safari ride, watch the nemo musical show (and I'm not normally into musicals), would not recommend the dinosaur ride for youngsters under 5 (dark, loud, scary ride). **Anyway...I travel a good bit and have stayed at many levels of hotels from the Wynn in Vegas, to the very basic Motel 11.

Contrary to the travellers from DC, we used the pool twice during the stay, once in the late morning when the sun was shining down a comfortable 72F and again the evening before we left. The pool was kept bath-water warm and was an excellent way to wind down at the end of a day, in preparation for our flights the next day. I habitually pick Marriott brand hotels over others because of the consistent quality and amenities they provide, no matter where you are travelling. The Fairfield Inn Orlando was no exception. It helps to start the day off with something to eat at the hotel breakfast area, instead of getting to a restaurant, ordering, eating, paying, it's almost noon and half a day wasted. The breakfast area was large and had plenty of tables. The variety of hot and cold breakfast items is good and there were healthier options available to the regular sugary pastries and cereals.

The pros - As written about previously the hotel is in a quiet location but very near the action - a good balance. The weather was too cool to tempt me into the pool (high 60's, low 70's - cooler at night) but it looked large and well maintained. The breakfast area is large with a good selection of items - no food is prepared for you but toasters and microwaves get the job done. The staff is friendly and accomodating, and the servers working the breakfast lounge kept it clean and well-stocked - quite the feat considering the crowd a couple mornings. The room was moderately sized and clean. Parking was ample and free. The cons - I guess that in spite of the other reviewers mentioning the same thing I'm going to the placement of this hotel as #1 in Orlando (with seemingly millions of competitors!) got my wife and I's hopes up a bit too high - not the hotel's fault assuredly. The lobby is sort of a pass through to the elevator banks and really needs some updating (not dirty, but needs some style). The hallways are kind of dank (is that a word?) and narrow, and the rooms are average and actually well priced for what you get - again the #1 rating had me picturing a beautiful suite. The A/C comes from a large window unit that does the job but which has to noisily cycle on and off to do it - no central A/C. The bathroom consists of a toilet and shower in a small room that is separate from the sink - good for having multiple people be able to get ready at the same time, but each area seems small when cut in half, so to speak. Bottom line - I'd definately consider staying here again, and the hotel is very well priced.

Also, the breakfast was really good, lot of items to choose from and not crowded in the breakfast room. Free parking was also nice and easy. Service was also good (save as to the pool thing explaned below). Then the negatives/averages. The room was at most average. The air-conditioning was oldfashioned and super noisy (not possible to sleep if it is on) and it did not really work too good, at least with hot air. The windows were thin and it was a cold week in Orlando, so not very nice that the heating did not work properly. There should at least be more blankets in the rooms if the heating does not work! Then one huge huge issue, which could be an asset for the hotel but during our stay it definitely was not: the pool! They have an ok pool with a nice whirlpool. But: the second AND the third day of our stay, the whole pool area is closed!! And due to cleaning they said, as if, how can it take whole two days to clean one small pool area?? That was really bad service to the customers, I have to say. I was so irritated because you really do need the pool relaxation after those long days at the parks. They should really understand that MOST of their customers for sure come to Orlando to do the parks and some serious shopping, and you are tired after all that - so if I have booked a hotel with a pool, I expect to have the pool working at least two days out of three! They did say that we could use the pool of some close-by hotel, but leaving to another hotel to just use the pool would really frustrate the purpose of a relaxing pool experience, wouldn't it? But like said, an ok hotel, even could be nice if the pool and the air-conditioning machine would be working, but still no Tripadvisor #1. Ps. I took the advice from some people here on Tripadvisor, and did not take the hotel shuttle but drove the car to Universal.

Download one, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth it. I used the free internet & pcs in the business area which was good for checking email etc. Smallish gym with bikes, cross trainers & running machines etc (which I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use as I was on holiday!) and a decent sized pool. Used the laundry which was very useful before we travelled onto our second week in New York. While I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I will be back in the Orlando area for a while, if that changed, I would definitely use the Fairfield again. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a 5 star luxury hotel (it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t claim to be) but for the money, if you need a safe, clean, comfortable hotel near Int Drive, you would be hard pushed to do better than the Fairfield.", "Date": "October 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "dudley", "Title": "\u201cfantastic hotel with great service!\u201d", "Author": "fishcakesDudley", "ReviewID": "UR20665709", "Content": "our family stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks in august. the rooms were a really good size we definately didn't feel like we were on top of each other, with the beds being more comfortable than ny home bed! the only downside was we had a double room and not a suite so we didn't have a fridge, we remedied this by buying a $1.60 chest from walmart and topped it up with the free ice! they were lovely and clean with maid service daily, we even had to tell the maid not to change the hand soap after just one use! the staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. the breakfast was lovely, ranging from cereals to toast and waffles with fresh fruit we were a bit cheeky and bought some foil from walmart and took pastries from breakfast to have at the parks later in the day! the pool area was lovely and clean with towels provided . we will definately be staying at this hotel again in 2010!", "Date": "October 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for our needs\u201d", "Author": "GosportEngland", "ReviewID": "UR20465833", "Content": "Staff were excellent!

It was an all round good choice for price, location, service, facilities and standard. There was free breakfast included along with our room, which was a King Suite. This comprises of a lounge seating area with tv and stereo, sofa, seat and coffee table. The double mirrored wardrobe acted as a 'divide' from the bedroom to the lounge area. A desk/dressing table and further spacious drawers with yet another tv to the bed side of the room. The bed was king size and comfy! There was internet access down in the lobby for free and free printing services - great if you need to print off info of the local area to digest in your room or if you are booking those leg roomy seats on the plane back home!! I would say the location is a bonus, as it is just off International Drive - about a 3 minute walk. Its all on the flat so no problems if you have mobility issues. The pool and spa were always immaculate and pool towels were provided, which is a great bonus to save room in the suitcase! There was hairdrying facilities, soaps, shampoos etc everyday - another space saving bonus! (A famous brand name too, not just the crappy cheap stuff!!). Breakfast was simple, but enough to start your day off well. Continental style buffet, which was stocked regularly and hot fresh coffee was always available. There was the option to purchase park / attraction tickets at Reception, but we found it cheaper to go to one of the designated booths about 1mile away.

I went on line, straight to the Marriott web sight and booked a suite for $99. I booked this room for 3 nights. At first I thought this is not a big entrance. Than I thought to my self this is not a big hotel. Once I got in the room, I was like this is not the biggest suite I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in. I kept thinking to my self why is this number one. Than little by little it all sank in. First the location, it is perfect right off international drive, same street as the big McDonalds. You could get to any park easily and quickly, as well as all the attractions on international. Than the hotel, small but clean well maintained, with great service. Finally the room, clean moderately spacious separated seating area with its own TV and fridge and microwave, as well as a small desk or eating table. So while this is not the most luxurious hotel, the biggest hotel, the resort on a park hotel; it is vary much the most convenient. This hotel separates it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s self from the rest, by doing very simple but very effective things. One great service, on Friday I went out to eat at Le Coq Au Vin, another well deserved number 1. While passing the lobby I asked for directions and they went online and printed me out directions. They made that little extra effort that made a difference to me. Two they maintain the property clean and friendly. Finally the rooms clean with the right amenities.

Whilst I was abroad I had to forward some documents to work but the printer ran out of ink (this is the computer and printer that are free to use and come in very useful, there is also free wireless for those with laptops!) so i informed reception and they let me use their printer and they even faxed over 30 sheets to the UK free of charge! I was very impressed with how amazing the service was. If a taxi is needed then they will order this for you once you've given them the necessary information. As we were in Orlando we didn't spend much free time in the hotel so didn't use the pool but what we saw of it was fine, there was a reasonably sized gym and a jacuzzi! International Drive is about 10 mins away but if you cut across the field directly opposite the hotel it cuts your time in half (you will come out by O'Shucks pub on International Drive). The Bus service from the hotel to the parks was a brilliant thing to have, although they do not go to Disney but this was not a problem for us as we stayed in Disney for 6 nights before arriving at this hotel as we are not old enough to rent a car! However, even if you miss the complimentary bus service, the I-Ride is only round the corner and that will take you to seaworld, aquatica, universal etc. Be sure to pick up the masses of coupon books round the corner from reception, they will save you some money. There is also a little shop in the lobby area for snacks and drinks and small souveneirs etc and next door to it there is a games room with different arcade machines! The rooms were reasonably sized, for just two of us there was plenty of room. The Air-Conditioning can be a bit noisy but you get use to it and I'd rather have it there and noisy than not there at all!! The beds were really comfy and there is plenty of room to store your clothes. I hope this review has helped and if there is anything I have missed that you want to know about please feel free to message me and i'd be more than happy to help!", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southeast USA", "Title": "\u201cLoved this Fairfield Inn!\u201d", "Author": "SarahSoutheastUSA", "ReviewID": "UR16982042", "Content": "A very nice Fairfield Inn.

I was pleased with the response. The rooms were a little dated in my opinion (blond wood and hunter green carpet), but the rooms were clean and in good condition which is what really counts. We had a king suite for the two of us and it was perfect for us. For a rate of $105, it was a good deal. On the last night of our stay, a bus full of school kids checked in but they were (fortunately) not on our floor. We used the Universal shuttle on 2 days and it went well. Be sure to check the departure schedule posted on the signs at Universal. One group on our return shuttle ended up on the way to the wrong Fairfield Inn. We usually grabbed breakfast on the way out. The breakfast area was usually busy, but not too bad. A good selection of fruit, breads, pastries, yogurt, cereals, etc. The hotel is in a safe area, within walking distance to the Pirate Show, an amusement center, I-Drive, Chili's, and TGI Fridays.

Nothing was too much trouble and never a frown! My sister in law rang the hotel whilst we were on holiday and they agreed to go to Publix and get us an anniversary cake and balloon - when we got in from the park there was the cake, balloon and a card from my sister in law and husband. They also booked a dinner reservation for us for our anniversary meal (at our request). We had the twin double room with the rollaway bed - which is a permament camp bed style, very comfortable. Hotel under going refurb, but never interfered with our enjoyment of the place. There is a small shop. They have vending machines (ideal place to get rid of your change!) on every floor plus ice machines too. There is a small gym, nice pool area with hot tub and loads of clean towels. Breakfast is all you can eat, sometimes it got a little busy, and they didnt have everything available on every day, but considering the price of the hotel the choice and quality are very good. 24 hour tea and coffee was often used! PC in the lobby was really useful for emailing home and checking my credit card balance! There was a printer too if you needed it. Used the complimentary deposit box to keep valuables in. We held the key. The rooms very very clean, I was impressed with the standard for the star rating it has. Bathroom was spotless. I liked the half height bath - the shower was wonderful, but the half bath was great for our youngest daughter. Plenty of towels - always spotlessly clean! Hairdryer provided was adequate, and the iron and board came in handy as did the laundry room, which was cheap too - saved us buying clothes we didnt really need.

We did not try the shuttle service to Sea World and Universal Studion, but it was an option. Disney World shuttles were available for a fee. Smoking was not allowed in the hotel, or on the patio outside, but some guests did smoke outside. It made it very unpleasant to sit outside and be downwind of cigarette smoke. The pool and the hot tub were very nice. The continental breakfast was very extensive and included hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, breakfast sandwiches, pastry, fresh fruit, coffee, juices, bagels, toast, cereal, etc. Breakfast was usually very busy, but still it worked well, and the attendants were quick to replace any items that ran out.

This didn't really affect us as most nights we didn't get back until 10 so didn't have to hear the noise for long. The provided breakfast was good, sometimes it got a bit crowded around 8am but when we went down earlier there was plenty of room. That said even when crowded we still got a table and the staff made sure everything was replenished well before it ran out. Various selection of sweet pastries, croissants, bagels, Bread and a toaster, lots of different cereals, yogurts,cold hard boiled eggs, Jim Dean egg & bacon biscuits that you self microwave, Tea, Coffee and fruit juices and when we stayed Banana's and oranges. Location wise its great for Universal/Wet n Wild - 5min drive and getting to the Disney Parks only took 15 mins.

The bed was extremely comfortable and is super kingsize (uk sizing) My 10 year old son found the sofa bed very comfortable too. The maid cleaned our room very well every day, after a busy day at the parks we always returned to a spotlessly clean room and bathroom. The hotel is in the perfect location just off of the International Drive down a very quite road. There are plenty of places to eat at. We found TGI Fridays very good and only a 2 minutes walk from the hotel, and Sizzlers is also very good value for money with wonderful food and a fantastic salad/starters bare which is all you can eat. You really do need to go there, especially if you enjoy a good steak! We found this one the cheapest places to eat as well as the perfect steaks. I would avoid booking the Pirates dinner show which is also a 2 minute walk from Fairfield Inn. Its a total waste of money, the actual show itself is ok, but the food was awful and not worth the money.

I try to base my 'bubble' ratings upon expectations when booking a property vs. actual experience. It's not the Ritz, but for the going rates, you really can't beat the amenities and service. Our room was ready upon arrival, and our floor/level request met. The room seemed VERY clean compared with so many in Orlando. Our only complaint might be the carpet in the corridors themselves needed to be replaced. But this is Orlando, and they no doubt take a beating. I'd much prefer the carpet in my ROOM be nice..and it was! Breakfast was plenty and well stocked. OJ ran out as I was pouring, and the fellas working were right on it. Breakfast was early, but that didn't bother us--we're early risers. I also suspect this might help keep some of the crowds down. We grabbed ours and headed back to the room. The game room is pretty nice for a lodging of this rating/size! Also liked the idea of the 'terrace' seating between the pool and breakfast area. The workout room...well, it's nice they even offer one. There were towels supplied and a TV, and I believe a water fountain (believe it or not, I was in a \"4 Diamond\" lodging in Vegas this summer with a gorgeous workout facitlity--but with NO water fountain...???). The equipment at the Fairfield consisted of 5 or 6 cardio machines. For me personally, I KNOW I'm gonna get my cardio in when I'm in Orlando. But again, it's a nice gesture. I put the room on the 'wrong' card (Marriott is running a point special with another). Front desk staff was quick to switch it out for me. Bill was under my door early the next morning, and CORRECT. Disney still ties your bill to your door handle on the day of departure, which I find simply GOOFY (every pun intended) in this day and age of ID theft/concerns. Hotel is in a good/quiet, if somewhat removed, location. A right onto Sand Lake, and then a few minutes east to Universal or west to Disney. A note form a native Floridian (now transplanted to the bitter cold): I personally tend to skip any restaurant with a 'running digital ticker' on their sign. To me, it just screams 'tourist trap'. Such is Fish Bones, on the corner as you turn into the hotel. If you have a car, come out to Sand Lake and make a right. Go under I4 and keep traveling north for appx a mile or two (I believe it is in the 7300 block). On your left will be a place: BONE FISH. Not to be missed, full of locals; the food is wonderful, the atmosphere hip, and the prices beyond fair (about half of Fish Bones). Let me clarify: the food may be great at Fish Bones; I don't know. What I DO know is that the food IS fabulous at Bone Fish, and the prices ARE half that of Fish Bones. Some other nice dinner ideas: Vito's on I-Drive for steak, Cafe Tu Tu Tangos, I-Drive, for tapas (and cool atmosphere!), and The Flying Fish on Disney's Boardwalk.

I would not hesitate to stay there again.", "Date": "May 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThe best experience we've had in Orlando - highly recommended\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4997497", "Content": "Excellent service, friendly staff, clean and recently rennovated rooms. Great breakfast - which varies from day to day, but during our stay includes fresh pastries, sausage, eggs, porridge etc, all cooked to a high standard. Free vending tea and coffee all night and day (which is great if you are a Brit like us and need a hot tea after a hard day at the parks :-). The pool is big and clean, and the hot outside spa refreshing. All the staff seemed to respect the hotel guests, and the front desk team couldn't do enough to help. It's no surprise to us that this hotel seems to attract lots of business travellers. The only downside is that the property is set back just off I-Drive, so you've got a 5 minute walk to get to and from the I-bus and so on. But this is a price worth paying for the quality of the Fairfield Inn. And one nice touch; on our final day, while we were waiting to be taken to the airport, the reception staff offered us complimentary drinks and snacks - what a nice gesture :-) Well done Marriot - compared to some of the properties we've stayed in in Orlando, you should be extremely proud.", "Date": "April 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spring Lake, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "traveler1974", "ReviewID": "UR4733129", "Content": "Loved this hotel!
