In retrospect my stay at the Hotel Okura Amsterdam was closer to perfection than any hotel stay I can recall in recent years. A truly grand hotel, it is an expression of European tradition brought to contemporary life by a dedicated team of professionals. Inspired by the best of continental five star hotel tradition, it also offers a sophisticated touch of Japan in the form of Yamazato, a one star Michelin rated Japanese restaurant as well as arguably the best teppanyaki restaurant outside of Japan. Preparing for a dinner date with the 2 star Michelin Ciel Bleu that evening, I noticed from the pool area two chefs plucking berries and harvesting fresh vegetables in the hotel garden and immediately knew Ciel Bleu would not disappoint. Hints of Okura's Japanese roots appear in public areas from the ginko leaf motif on walls to the bizen pottery delicately on display. As I was preparing to leave, another two chefs were setting up an elaborate display of hand crafted Easter eggs in the lobby. Despite no doubt going through a number of refurbishements and additions over the years, the hotel evokes a remarkable sense of tranquility and consistency. My room functioned perfectly in every respect and the hotel staff could not be faulted. To boot, I purchased a pre paid euro 33 taxi voucher to transport me to Schipol, proving it's location definitely is convenient to both downtown and the airport.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey", "Title": "\u201cFree upgrade, fantastic value!\u201d", "Author": "Milesandmilesaway", "ReviewID": "UR127154121", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights recently.

The bath was really spacious and there was only a glass seperating the room which meant you could watch TV while you bathed which was quite nice :) There was also a lovely Nespresso machine in the room, but only creamer was provided which made the coffee taste a little strange... I did also find it a little inconvenient of not having a kettle in the room at all. The hotel had 3 pin plugs which is quite thoughtful of travellers who might have forgotten their adapters. I also ate in the Michelin star Japanese restaurant, which was delicious and sat at the sushi bar where authentic japanese chef prepared sushi. In all I did enjoy the stay here, although the breakfast at 30 Euros appears to be a little overpriced for what was on offer especially as the scrambled eggs tasted horrible!

The Lounge also serve tea/coffee and other drinks and cookies and is open from 7am to 10 pm. Amenities is of 5 star and they serve great buffet breakfast except that you have the same breakfast everyday. They also have a Japanese restaurant which is a little bit pricey but the food was great with authentic Japanese server which explain to the guest each course. A French restaurant which is very strict in punctuality, they will cancel your reservation if you are late. One of our friend left her money (Dollars and Euro) on top of the table of her room. When she got back from the convention, she was surprised that she had left her money but when she checked it, not one cent were missing. She was all praised with the honesty of housekeeping. This gave the group a very nice impression of this hotel. Going around is not so hard except that you should alot about 20 minutes to get to the city center. Outside the hotel near Savoy hotel you can easily take the tram. You can purchase your 24 hours ticket at 7 euro or 48 hours ticket at 12euro from the hotel concierge before boarding. In case you forgot you can just pay the fare at 2.60 euro to the driver for one way. Tram 25 will bring you up to the Central station and Tram 12 will bring you to Van Gogh museum. Just ask for a map from the hotel concierge and you will see all the Tram numbers and its route which is very easy. Getting back is a breeze just go to the opposite side where you get off and it will bring you back to your hotel. Or you can just check the tram stop if the tram number you wish to take would pass that stop or not. There are only few shops near the hotel and few restaurants. Ikea is very near just beside the convention center. Tram 4 goes from the convention center to the Central Station. If shopping is what you wish just go to DAM square and near Royal Palace there are a lots of souvenir and specialty shops. You can also take an Hop on hop off bus near the Central station and Red Light district is also near the station. For last minute shopper, go early to the airport . After check-in for your next flight, and if you still got ample time, go to the arrival area you will find lots of shops which is sometimes cheaper than downtown.

The bad points included - a very compact room which at 250 euros plus tax, was not worth the money - a ludicrously expensive breakfast at 30 euros, which could not even claim to show any imagination and included the dreaded sweaty 'buffet bacon'. At this price, I expect flair and/or breakfast to be freshly cooked and plated. The in room breakfast was even worse, comprising hard toast, unpleasant pastries and a boiled egg that was hard boiled. Since the hotel does have high quality (though again, seriously expensive) restaurants, there really is no excuse for this standard - when I complained, I was offered the alternative 'light breakfast' of a coffee and 2 croissants, for an inflated 15.5 euros, but note they are really aiming to catch you for the higher rate - an equally ludicrous 17 euros a day for internet access - a quite unacceptable 15 euros to use the hotel swimming pool, a quite unheard of practise for a core facility, and more akin to the likes of Ryanair's approach - the main downstairs bar seemed to shut at 10pm - aircon in the room did not seem to go below 20 degrees, for those who prefer cooler temperatures when they sleep - to cap it all, I could have got the room 20% cheaper on the internet compared to the conference rate, obviously viewing conference business as a valid cause for more fleecing If you stayed as a couple, had the breakfast, used the pool and the internet, your actual rate would around 370 euros.

I chose to stay here for the convenience because the hotel was the location of the conference. Lobby/Reception: I found the lobby rather nice for meeting people in, there are a number of sofas and chairs that can be used for small meetings or waiting for colleagues. It was clean, open, brightly lit, it is very stark and sparse in style. The front desk staff was very nice and competent - no problems there and they let us check out the night before we left so we could go straight to the airport. Unlike another reviewer, I was happy with the concierge. We put him into service a number of times, from directions to the Pijp market area to restaurant suggestions to shopping suggestions. The elevators were enough to accommodate everyone, I never waited inordinately long for one. Rooms: My room was very nice, with a great view of the canal, the stadium, etc. I loved how I could put the shade up between the bathroom and the rest of the room, and see the outdoors, the TV, etc. from the bath. The shower is nice - has the handheld and the rainshower parts both. The TV is a flat screen, best viewed from the chair near the window. Lots of channels in a number of different languages. There was a safe that worked well, big closets, and a minibar fridge that didn't have sensors so you could put your own food into it. (Although considering a block up the street was the Savoy that had free minibar items and free coffee, tea and continental breakfast...) It was annoying that there wasn't even a hot pot with tea bags or coffee maker in the room. Comfortable pillows and duvet. However, you cannot change the thermostat, which was annoying. I arrived during a cold spell, and didn't have clothing as warm as I needed for sleeping and being in the room - I tried to change the temperature, but it was stuck at 20 degrees C. I thought it was my room but my colleagues had the same complaint! What's the use of having individual thermostats in your rooms if the guests can't make use of them? Location: At first I wasn't thrilled with this location. It is outside of the downtown area. But as I spent more time in the Pijp I liked it more. There are a couple of tram lines that are right there - five minutes outside the hotel to both the right and the left there are tram stops = and the lines take you to the downtown areas. Get the map from the front desk or concierge. Also, it is very near to the Albert something or other market, which is really nice and has a LOT of bars and restaurants all over the place. It's also near a delightful park where tons of people hang out and is really pleasant. There are a number of great restaurants within 2 blocks, including some steakhouses, the best Caprese salad I have ever had, lots of Japanese restaurants that I didn't try, and a great local breakfast and coffee place called \"@7\". There are three grocery stores within three blocks as well. Restaurants: Actually, I wouldn't know. They were so expensive there's no way I could eat there. (The concierge responded appropriately and didn't seem to judge when we asked for recommendations of casual, inexpensive places.) Breakfast alone would have been 30 euros. Some colleagues were caught between meetings and got sandwiches in the bar - they were like cold cut sandwiches on wheat bread - and we got the ,2L of coke to sip while accompanying them - their sandwiches were 25 euros and our sodas almost 5 euros. Insane! Luckily there are some great restaurants nearby. Extras: This was my biggest issue. EVERYTHING was an extra. Want to use the gym? That'll be 15 euros. Want internet? 17 euros. I sucked it up and did the gym twice, but only when I made sure I had enough time to use EVERYTHING and take full advantage of it. No 15 euros to hop on the treadmill or stairmaster for half an hour and done. No, I took full advantage of the 18 meter pool to swim 2km each time (it is a very nice pool, but they don't use lanelines and it got choppy to try and swim with 3 people in the pool - don't know what would have happened if there had been a fourth), I also used the sauna, the jacuzzi, the tanning booth in the ladies locker room, even the showers and their own conditioner, shampoo and body wash. BTW, the pool was cold and jacuzzi not all that warm either - it was fine for me but it wasn't normal. The locker setup was nice, you could have a locker with a key, which you could fasten around a wrist and ankle while you swam or worked out, so you could have hands free and not worry about it. There were some machines and a couple of free weights but not a whole lot there. I went elsewhere for internet. At this caliber of hotel I would expect these items to be included, as well as at least a continental breakfast. All in all, it turned out fine, but I would not stay here again. For the money - and also on principle - there are places just as good where you get a lot more for the money.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cToo expensive, snotty concierge\u201d", "Author": "zetaarae", "ReviewID": "UR66990372", "Content": "I will say that the room, a basic room, was spacious and full of light, with two big windows, which we enjoyed.

You know what, though, I am sure the restaurants were great -- but the prices were just insane. I could not bring myself to pay 29.50 Euros (equivalent to nearly $40 US) per person for breakfast. It's just a bread basket, hard boiled egg, fruit, and coffee/juice. WTF? We peeped at the dinner menu for one of the restaurants, and it was even crazier. I had read that the restaurants were pricey, but really had no idea just how expensive...at five star restaurants in Dallas, I have spent as much as $125 for a special event and an exquisite meal for two people. That seems like a lot, but I was OK with it, for the experience. However, this pricing was absolutely crazy town, in my opinion. I saw another reviewer mentioning spending over 200 Euros for dinner! Would you pay $260 U.S. dollars for food? Just doesn't make sense to me. It will be gone in less than an hour. One day, we went down to meet with the concierge to ask about a beach that a friendly bartender had recommended to us. We could not remember the name, but it sounded great, so I thought the concierge might know. We smiled, said hello, and explained what we were looking for to a desk attendant, who looked at us like we were crazy, then went to get the concierge, and translated our question to him (We spoke in English). He did not acknowledge us at all at first -- did not say a word, or even make eye contact with us. In fact, he did not glance in our direction. I felt like a slug. With a frowning face, he looked up something on his computer, then finally spoke, still not glancing at us. He asked, \"Is this it?\" and turned the laptop toward us. There were photos, but nothing that looked like a beach. I was embarrassed and disappointed, and felt stupid for asking in the first place. I said, \"Sure, thanks.\" and we left. Why was he so hateful to us? I thought a concierge was supposed to be friendly and informative and welcoming. He was precisely the opposite. Was it because we spoke English? We were polite as we could be, and I would think that a hotel, which accommodates tourists by the nature of its business, should be open to people who speak other languages... I know in the U.S., this is the case, especially with Spanish and other commonly spoken languages... This was my biggest disappointment with the hotel. If I could rate the concierge, I would give him a negative five stars for making me feel like a jerk.

We flew into Amsterdam and spent one night at the Okura before starting the cruise. Since the night was part of a \"package\" we didn't pay for the hotel directly, but I checked out what it would have cost us if we'd reserved on our own, and it wasn't worth the price, particularly when the hotel is located in the southern part of the city, a long distance from the main part of town in the north, and far from any major sites. Unless you love to walk, you'll end up taking public transportation or a taxi (there were many lined up at the entrance and several were Mercedes!). The were no restaurants close by, other than the HIGHLY priced ones located at the hotel (meals started at 70 Euros!). We walked around that afternoon looking for restaurants and finally found some, but they were all closed due to late July being \"holiday\" time. We searched for an ATM to pick up Euros but there were none at the hotel or in the direct vicinity. We ended up finding some food at a small deli several blocks away from the hotel and eating in our room. Most of the Okura clients appeared to be Japanese businessmen in expensive suits. We felt under-dressed in our jeans and t-shirts. The hotel lobby is tastefully decorated in expensive, elaborate glass vases, tables and light fixtures. The hotel staff were very cordial. One man at the front desk spoke English well and was a big help the 2nd day, calling the airlines for us, because we were waiting to hear about our checked luggage which had been left in Chicago and was supposed to be delivered to us. Our large, attractively decorated corner room was on the 10th floor with panoramic window views of the city and canals (the hotel is situated on a canal which is quite picturesque with benches where you can sit and people watch). The room was clean, although the rug had a couple of dark spots where something had been spilled in the past. We noted that the hotel's website describes some amenities that only certain more expensive rooms must have. Ours had the basics, which was all we needed. The shower tended to go hot/cold, which was annoying. The linens were good quality and heavy, there was a stocked mini fridge and wet bar in the room that had booze, soda, and snacks for sale, and the bed was quite comfortable. Overall, the best part of the stay was the room's view. We took some good photos.

For business I found it to be a good hotel - an expensive hotel, but a good one. So, when planning a family trip to Amsterdam I decided to 'treat' us all to an Okura stay opting to pay the premium for the opulence and then the additional premium for one of their executive suites. This led to three sleepless nights and my families\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 disaffection with the whole \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpremium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hotel experience. The problems started just after midnight on the first night of our stay. Our room, we now know, was directly below the roof top \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCiel Bleu Restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or to be more specific, the kitchen of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCiel Bleu Restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (to be pedantic, the tiled floor of the kitchen of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCiel Bleu Restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122). Between 00:30 and 02:45 on Sunday morning, my wife, our eight year old daughter and I lay in our beds listening to the crash and bash of pots and pans being washed, the clink and chink of glasses and crockery being put away and heavens knows what being repeatedly dragged across the kitchen floor just above our beds. Our complaints were listened to with empathy, but the hotel was fully booked. We were not able to move to another room. We just made breakfast, somewhat bleary eyed, before it stopped service in the morning whereupon we where confronted by another issue. Our daughter would be charged the same rate as an adult for breakfast: Thirty Euros (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Twenty UK Pounds or Forty US Dollars) which has be the most expensive slice of toast, as that is all my daughter ate for breakfast, in any hotel anywhere. Sunday night/Monday morning was not as bad. Perhaps the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCiel Bleu Restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 had had a quiet night. Anyhow, we got to sleep by around 01:30. My wife decided to skip breakfast in the morning opting for an extra half an hour in bed, but asked that we bring her back a croissant. The staff, however, did not think much of that idea and so we came to the next issue. Despite paying another thirty Euros for my daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slice of toast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is now sixty Euros (Forty Pounds or Eighty Dollars) - for two slices of toast, they objected to my taking a croissant back to the room. The staff suggested that I pay another Thirty Euros (standard buffet breakfast charge), plus room service charge, to have the croissant delivered to the room. Needless to say that I left the croissant on the breakfast table and my wife went hungry. I will say that as a consequence of this I was now in the dog house \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a noisy, expensive dog house \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and everything was my fault. So much for a family \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctreat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122! Monday night/Tuesday morning capped the previous two nights. The noise from the kitchen was preceded by the music from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcChampagne and Cocktail Lounge Bar Twenty Third\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (our room was on the twenty second floor). Calls to reception finally managed to reduce the din from both the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcChampagne and Cocktail Lounge Bar Twenty Third\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the kitchen of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCiel Bleu Restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to a reasonable level, but the occasional accidentally dropped bottle, glass, pot, pan, ladle, cutlery, crockery and who knows what else kept us awake until 03:00. Between 03:00 and 06:30 on Tuesday morning we had a fantastic sleep. Given the option we would have slept longer, but the final issue put pay to that. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOkura Executive Lounge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, was next to our room and opens at 07:00. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOkura Executive Lounge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has a wooden floor. The staff in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOkura Executive Lounge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are attractive and pleasant young ladies whose smart uniform includes high heal shoes. High heal shoes and wooden floors are not good bed fellows, if it is your intention to sleep that is. Exasperated I trudged down to reception again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in my pyjamas this time, not a pleasant sight for my fellow guests \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and vented my thoughts about the Hotel Okura, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCiel Bleu Restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcChampagne and Cocktail Lounge Bar Twenty Third\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOkura Executive Lounge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the Sixty Euros for two rounds of toast to the attractive and pleasant young lady whose desk was labelled \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGuest Relations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and whose smart uniform included high heal shoes. I returned to reception a couple of hours later to check out. The attractive and pleasant lady whose desk was labelled \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGuest Relations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 offered, after listening to my criticisms and much debate, to deduct one nights stay from the bill. It still is a nice hotel and the staff are very nice and efficient. But, the hotel does not understand or cater for children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c do not take yours there. Do not pay the extra on top of the extra to stay at this hotel to stay on the Executive floor (the 22nd), you will get no sleep. And finally: you (or at least I) usually leave a hotel with a feeling for its rank; ones own star rating if you will. I left the Hotel Okura Amsterdam with a niggling feeling that its modus operandi was that of a money making machine rather than a luxury hotel - the sort of niggling feeling that makes you think when the staff smile at you that there will be a charge for it on your bill. A bad illustration because, as mentioned, the staff were very nice, but the feeling remains and the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rank, to my mind, is as a consequence a lowly one.", "Date": "September 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beverley, East Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel .....
