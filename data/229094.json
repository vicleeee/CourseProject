The front desk has a free map with all of the attractions listed that is far more useful than the maps in the guide books that we purchased. We enjoyed good weather between Christmas and New Year's so we walked almost everywhere. If you are very comfortable with public transportation the subway/train system is fair. Do not expect the Washington DC Metro or the London Underground. The stations are filthy, the signage is not the best and the subway stops near tourist destinations have their share of pickpockets.

If you want to use their computers in the lobby, you get 15 to 30 minutes free to use, depending on which front desk person you get. I'm not sure what the reasoning is for that. Our room was large for Rome and it had a patio and overlooked Vatican City, beautiful view at night time. The bathroom was kinda disgusting and old, similar to what the other reviews posted, this Courtyard needs renovation. Our shower curtain had blood stains on it and I was completely grossed out and was going to call them to change it the next morning except housekeeping had entered our room even though the 'Do no disturb' sign was on! Nice it was changed, but not so nice when I asked them to not come in while we were gone. The hotel sends you to a little family restaurant a block away in a small strip mall but that wasn't open the night we came. We actually found a nice pizzeria that sells everything and at reasonable prices! If you turn right at the light up the hill from the hotel rather than left, go about 1 block you will see a small pizzeria. People are really nice and food was great!

I chose this hotel because its a known chain that I have used before and wanted a set standard. Rooms are large, clean and modern with most rooms going onto a balcony with seats. The hotel does offer a shuttle service to the central attractions, but we travelled by the local train, changing onto the metro. All of which was hassle free and added to the holiday, mixing with the locals. The hotel is set just off a main road, but tucked away enough to be quiet. Check-in was easy and straightforward, as was check-out. Do note, as with all hotels in Rome, you have to pay a city tax which is per person per night. If you want a reputable chain I can recommend this hotel, despite the distance, its well worth the travelling. After all, it is no different to staying the other side of London and heading over by Underground. The usual in room amenities are found, shower gel miniatures, in room safe and large flat screen TV. If you do use the local train to reach the hotel, when you exit the station, you will go up a set of stairs, on reaching the top, you will see another set of stairs and a path to the side, go up the stairs and turn left which takes you out the station.

He is a Marriott Platinum Rewards member so we decided to use his points for our stay at this particular hotel. First, this hotel is supposed to be a category 6 but don't believe the hype. On walking into the hallways and the rooms, you'd think you just walked into a motel or some lower category hotel. We were supposedly on the executive floor but it sure didn't feel like it. The room's layout was ok, the bathroom was tiny (which was expected) and the sink did not look too clean around the edges. Our first night, my husband started suffering from terrible allergies - congestion, difficulty in breathing- but these would clear the minute we stepped out of the room. After about two days, we had to go to the local Farmaccia to buy some antihistamines. The bathroom smelled badly of mildew. The hotel was fully booked so we could not change our room. Also, the bed was really hard and uncomfortable. We did not notice this the first two nights because we were exhausted from our flight in and from sightseeing. However, on subsequent nights, we'd wake up feeling really achy and we're young people! I normally prefer to sleep on firm mattresses because of my back, but this was almost like sleeping on a rock! By the way, do not waste your euros taking their shuttle to the Vatican. It is 3 euros each way and if there are at least 2 people in your party, you're looking at 12 euros per day minimum. There's a train station about a 5 min walk away called Gemelli, and you can buy the Roma pass, or buy the normal timed tickets at 1 euro each, hop on the regional train (trenitalia) going toward Ostiense and connect to the metro with the same ticket. Very easy to do. Ask the Hotel's front desk for maps, directions, and schedules, and tickets. Very easy to do. It is even just as easy to take in the train and metro from the airport rather than taking a taxi that costs 50 Euros. That's about 70 dollars! There are not many eateries in this area. There's a really nice Gelaterie, about two or three pizzerias, and one restaurant that serves nice food. It is hard to stay in the city till late at night because the metro stops around 9 pm due to some construction work, and the regional trains stop at 10:30pm. You can take a bus but that is too much of a hassle and the one time we did that, we almost got lost and it took us an hour to get back. The other option is to take a taxi which should cost about 15 euros depending on how far away you are. We found it much easier on our pockets to take the train into town and eat breakfast and lunch there because it was much cheaper than trying to eat around here. All in all, do yourself a favor and stay someplace much closer to the city if you do not want to be hemmed in for the night at about 9 pm and if you suffer from allergies or hate hard and uncomfortable beds, or want to save your money for things like sightseeing and good food. At least, even if you end up in a hotel that's not so great but is right in the center, you have the advantage of the great location.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "FLORIDA", "Title": "\u201cnot too far from the city center - public transportation cheap and easy to use\u201d", "Author": "Lilly0508", "ReviewID": "UR113353046", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for one week while we visited Italy.

Unless you plan on getting back to the hotel before 10 p.m. every night, then the location is not that bad. (for more on details, see below). Otherwise ... NIGHTMARE. 2) The view was OUTSTANDING. We stayed in a beautiful large American style room with a million dollar view of St. Peter's in the Vatican but it cost us approx. $300/night. So if you plan on staying in the room alot, this hotel was wonderful. It's rare to find such large rooms in Italy. But after an hour, the view becomes less impressive 3) The WIFI is very expensive.

We arrived in the late afternoon and decided to head into the city of Rome for a late dinner. Then we walked around and enjoyed Rome at night. Around midnight, we decided to head back to the hotel. We tried to enter the subway but it was CLOSED. We eventually learned that the subway closes at midnight. Being from New York with a 24/7 subway, this was a shock. We tried to find a cab to take us back. No such luck. We finally persuaded a regular citizen (not a taxi driver) to take us to our hotel at one o'clock in the morning (after begging a dozen people with cars). It cost 50 euros. The next night, we made sure we entered the subway by 11 p.m. The subway took us to the last stop where we then had to transfer to another train to take us to our hotel. GUESS WHAT? THAT TRAIN STOPPED RUNNING AT 10 p.m. There were no people or cars in sight. And the streets were very dark and desolate. We had a map and after ONE HOUR of brisk walking, we were able to make our way back to the hotel via dark creepy hilly country roads adjacent to a park. Finally on our last night, we left Rome at 8 p.m. and were able to catch the hotel shuttle back to the hotel. So what's my point???? Unless you leave Rome at 8 p.m. every night, DON'T STAY HERE. For the same amount of money, you can book a 4 star hotel in the HEART OF ROME.

We didn't know about this until after we got to the hotel. The hotel shuttle drives into Rome and drops off/picks up passengers right outside of the Vatican. Its 2 euros per person each way and we used it every day (they have a schedule at the front desk); the charge can be billed to your room. The shuttle leaves exactly (if not 1 or 2 minutes early) at the scheduled time from the city so make sure you get gelato at Old Bridge across the street and eat it while you are waiting!

As this hotel is very far out (it is way too far to walk into the centre of Rome) a shuttle bus is provided which is helpful but only runs at certain hours. We decided to go out one evening and the shuttle bus had stopped running so the night time receptionist offered to call us a taxi. Whilst we were waiting for it to arrive we decided to go out front and take pictures by the palm tree's and as we were walking out the door he shouted over to us, in a rude tone, not to leave because the taxi was on the way. We explained we were only going to take pictures out front but he obviously did not believe us because he sent the bell boy out to watch us which was very patronising. When the taxi did arrive the metre was already at 12 euro's. We ran back inside to the reception and were told that because it arrived in under eight minutes that's the starting price. I would have rather waited 9 minutes and not had to pay such a ridiculous starting price. We felt the receptionist ought to have informed us of this sneaky charge but I assume they are on some sort of commission deal with the taxi company. Also they offer a shuttle back to the airport for 55 euro's, but we flagged down our own outside the hotel who did it for 40 euro's. Do not stay here it is just too far out form the centre, the last shuttle bus is at 9:30pm so if you wanted to have a relaxing meal and a drink out you then have to pay 25-30 euro's in a taxi to get back to the hotel. Also it is obviously not a very well known hotel, when we arrived at Rome train station none of the taxi drivers had heard of it or seemed to know where it was, it was 20 minutes before we found a taxi which was aware of it.

Our room on the 6th floor had a balcony and distant views over Rome. The room was really well equipped, clean and a good size. We were right outside the lifts, but that didn't cause any noise problems. There is as mentioned a shuttle bus service into Rome, drops off/picks up at one location, adjacent to the Vatican City walls. It makes the journey in and out every hour from 0800 through to 2200 hrs except for the period between 12 noon and 1600hrs when there is no shuttle. The journey took 20-30 mins depending on the traffic and it had plenty of room. We did have dinner at the Hotel, this was of good quality but very expensive. We also had breakfast, but the variety and the freshness was not great. The location, probably about 3 miles or so out of the centre is an issue, if you cope with the shuttle or the local trains (station about 5mins away) then it presents good value for money. Internet is available via computers in the lobby at 35c per min. I think there is also Wi-fi.

From a value perspective, it was 'great'! I also received a room upgrade so we were very lucky to be treated to a larger room. The location is a bit remote and this can prove tricky when using public transportation especially at night - the trains stop early. We got stuck one night and had to cab it back from Valle Aurelia - for 15 euro's. The shuttle from the hotel takes you right to the vatican for 2 euro's and we used this every day. It will also bring you back, but that service stops early in the evening - so, planning is a must. There is another review here about a local market close to the hotel where you can pick up bread, meats, wine etc. We found it and here is a bit more detail on where to go. It is the \"Supermercato\" on the other side of the 'very' busy road behind the hotel. From the hotel, go right on their street, take the next right and make your way (carefully) across they busy main road. It is a little bit to the right from here - you cannot miss it. Just walk down the paved laneway, it is at the bottom of this road. Bring cutlery and a corkscrew from home. You'll be able to enjoy late dinners or make and pack lunches for your siteseeing in Rome! We bought wine back to Canada that we purchased from here. The restaurant for breakfast buffet has many choices, we ate there only once. Very close to the hotel are restaurants and cafe's where you can get your early morning pastry and coffee. However, they have odd hours and sometimes were closed - not sure why. But, cornetti (pastry with early apricot marmalade, my favorite) and cappucino for 2 was less than 4 euro's. I never saw anyone walking down the street with a coffee in their hand like we do in North America. The pastry and coffee in Italy is amazing! The only not so great thing was booking a tour of the Vatican/Sistine chapel through the hotel. The booking was not good and the tour also disappointing. You cannot tour these two locations in 3 hours. Next time I would pay the money to \"skip the line\" and once inside, turn over the wireless headset to the tour guide and go on my own. All in all, it was a very nice, comfortable hotel. I would next time book in the centre of the city.

Lauderdale", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable with a very friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "MarcJordan", "ReviewID": "UR68233801", "Content": "I just returned from a week at the Marriott Rome Central Park. Prior to reserving a room there I scoured all of the TripAdvisor reviews trying to read between the lines to come up with a good idea of what to expect out of this hotel since its basic flaw seems to be that it\u2019s a bit out of the way. The hotel itself is very nice. If you are looking for a property with large, American sized rooms, incredibly comfy beds and linens, then this place is for you. The marble bathroom was very nice as were the balconies (half of the rooms face St. Peters) and the air conditioning would please even Chilly Willy (a very important factor in Rome). The staff could not have possibly been nicer and more accommodating. One gentleman at the front desk that I was super impressed with was Nicola. His English was as good as any American\u2019s, he\u2019s very well informed and was able to answer all of my questions (and girls, he\u2019s good looking too). Nicola represents this hotel in the best light. We opted to eat in the hotel each morning to save time. The overall selection was good but the scrambled eggs were a bit funky. The fruit was excellent and the selection of meat was quite good. Coffee is served out of a machine which will also dispense espresso, cappuccino and lattes. Cereals were plentiful as well. The hotel is located in a middle class residential area. As has been written here before, it\u2019s slim pickens when it comes to restaurant\u2019s in the area. There is a very good pizza place and a few doors down from there a full service restaurant with a somewhat limited menu called Taverna Sacchetti. Turn left on via Sacchetti and you will easily find them. Pizza was priced at about \u20ac4.50 for a large individual pie. The tavern had basic dishes (mostly pasta) for about \u20ac8.00, but that\u2019s about it folks for eating in the area. We did get a recommendation from the front desk for a restaurant that turned out to be excellent, but it is located one stop down on the train. When exiting the Balduina station, make a right and just a few feet away is Capperi, which is also located in residential area. The prices were very reasonable (about \u20ac12.00 per entr\u00e9e) and the meal was very good. The menu selection was large by the way. There is a full service supermarket located across via Sacchetti called Carrefour Mercato. It\u2019s very well hidden and located down a long driveway next to the bank. We stocked up on drinks and cheese there. Prices are not inflated because this is a typical neighborhood supermarket located miles away from tourists. Each room has a small fridge, so keeping soft drinks and water chilled was easy. Something else each floor has, which is a rarity in Europe, is an ice machine. Most of you reading this review are concerned about the hotel location. I\u2019ll give it to you straight folks, it\u2019s not terribly convenient. It\u2019s located a very short walk from the commuter rail line called the FM3, at the Gemelli station. You can connect to the subway three stops down but the transfer at Valle Aurelia is a slight pain because the commuter line runs on an elevated section and the subway is below ground. Since most escalators in Rome don\u2019t work, some people will be huffing and puffing, although each station does have an elevator (not that I would trust them \u2013 this is Rome you know). The basic problem with the commuter line is the wait between trains. At best it\u2019s 14 minutes (during rush hour), at worst \u2013 35 minutes. Twice we had missed the train by inches and waited the full 35 minutes. I didn\u2019t think having to take the train would bother me but it did because it meant that I couldn\u2019t simply go back to the hotel during midday and rest. My wife and I landed up leaving in the morning and eating dinner in Rome and heading back once we felt the day was over. The rail line seemed safe but the graffiti is something you have to see to believe (aesthetic pride is not one of Rome\u2019s strong suit). Each ride is a very reasonable \u20ac1.00 and you can purchase multi-day passes which allows you unlimited rides on the commuter lines, subways, buses and streetcars. This was the biggest bargain in all of Rome. Although the trains run on the honor system, I urge you to buy a ticket because I did get spot checked and those without a validated ticket will get a nice fat fine on the spot. The hotel has a shuttle service to a subway stop a few blocks from St. Peters (Ottaviano), but they charge \u20ac2.00 per person and I didn\u2019t think it was worth it. Others have written here that it\u2019s a free service so I\u2019m assuming they recently instituted the fee. The front desk can arrange a pickup from the airport for \u20ac55.00. My taxi ride from the hotel to the main railway station (Termini) cost \u20ac24.00 and took about 18 minutes at 7:00am. I brought my laptop and was able to find a \u201cstray\u201d WIFI signal and connected for nothing, otherwise the hotel does have wireless service at \u20ac17.00 per 24 hour period. I stayed at this Marriott property because I used Rewards points and didn\u2019t want to blow most of my account staying downtown at the Grand Flora. The amount of points I saved staying at the Central Park will allow me to stay a week at a beach resort, so I have no qualms about that. If you are adventurous and don\u2019t mind the inconvenience, then stay here. The staff will certainly make you feel at home.

We reserved two rooms, and the hotel accommodated our request for the rooms to be connected (door between the rooms). The room was nice, with wood floors, and was very clean. We did not have a balcony, but I believe this was due to my request for the connecting rooms. We had problems with the air conditioning in both rooms, but they were quickly fixed by the staff. We ate only one meal at the restaurant (and even then just from the bar menu). Food was good, and we did get an occasional bottle of wine for the room. The wine was priced similarly to (or even a little less than) a restaurant in the city. There is a grocery store across the street from Gemelli station, although I was never able to catch it open. The big (and really only) issue I had with the hotel is the location. Yes, what other people have written is true. It's not hard to get there on public transport, and the shuttle bus does run hourly (on the hour into the city, and on the half hour back to the hotel). What we found, though, was that the bus filled to capacity on almost every one of our trips (it's a 16 person bus). If you don't get there early, you get turned away. Also, the regional transport lines don't run that frequently on the weekends, and you can end up waiting for those if you go that way. In the end, it felt like we planned around the bus schedule. It would have been nice to stay closer in to the city to allow easy access to the hotel. One other minor thing - a couple of times I needed to speak to someone at the front desk before leaving for the day. The wait in the lobby was 10-15 minutes easily, as they only had two people working most days, and there are always lots of foreign travelers (like myself) trying to check in early.

It doesn't matter if it's the most amazing hotel in all of Italy if it's too far from the sights. We only used public transportation (i.e. regional trains, subways), and I felt it was totally reasonable. Rome's subway system is very effecient with frequent trains and signs indicating how long your wait will be. We never had to wait more than five minutes. You get off the A line at Valle Aurelia, take a short walk over to the train station, and hop on the northbound train. You go three stops and get off at Gemelli, and the hotel is less than a five minute walk away. The problem is that the regional train doesn't run as often as it should. And the train stations in Rome do not do a very good job of indicating which train comes when. We even almost got on a train that was going the right direction, but for some reason it was not stopping at the Gemelli station. If you caught the right trains at the right times, it could be a 15 minute trip to the heart of Rome. But if you don't, it could take a good hour. I felt it was a reasonable gamble considering the cheap tickets (1E one journey, but 4E for an all day pass - my recommendation). My husband found it tiring and often ridiculous. The hotel itself is very nice. As most travelers from the USA will, we arrived long before check in. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. We were able to get into a room at 10am. It was large, with beautiful wood floors, a balcony (which I was not expecting), a comfortable bed, and a very nice bathroom. It was recently aquired by Marriott and they've been doing improvements. I understand it is scheduled to be called a Courtyard, but I felt it was much nicer than your average Courtyard hotel room. I did not see Marriott on anything in the entire hotel, so they must not be in a hurry to make the transition. Overall, I felt it was a good value. We had a promotional rate of 110E per night. It was very nice, clean, and comfortable. It is further from the sights, but anything closer is outrageously priced. It's not hard to get to central Rome, it just could take some time depending on the trains. If you're flexible and don't mind waiting at train stations, then this is a great budget option for Rome.", "Date": "June 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lee, NJ", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Hotel quickly getting up to Marriott standards\u201d", "Author": "Arnie512", "ReviewID": "UR33594747", "Content": "My wife and I spent four nights (June18-21) and had a very comfortable stay.

The room was very modern and recently renovated and based on what we heard the hotel should be up to Marriott standards within a couple of months (mostly has to do with finishing exterior appearance). We enjoyed the main restaurant as they were serving outside and the weather was very cooperative. The grill was a major plus and the meals were served very professionally. The local restaurant that was recommended by the front desk was very enjoyable and reasonably priced. The only downside was that the free shuttle filled up quickly and there is only one van available.
