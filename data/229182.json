I realized my mistake about 2 hours after I made the booking and contacted the hotel. They said they were very sorry but if I wanted to change this booking I would have to cancel pay the 1100 euro and rebook for the dates that I want. Yes you heard me right I have to pay for the whole booking so that means paying for the same night twice??????? first to cancel the whole booking and then the other night so my booking went from 1100 euro to 2200 euro. Well obviously I will change my plans and be in the hotel on the dates I originally booked. However I will not spend one extra cent while I am there and I will never book another night with an NH Hotel ever again.

The hotel is located on Dam Square, directly across from the war monument. Due to its location on the Square and abutting (in the back) the red light district, expect a lot of tourists and the bars and restaurants in the immediate area charge tourist prices. It makes a great base of operations for foot tours of the majority of the city. We had no problem with noise at night (room on 3rd floor facing courtyard), and generally everyone was well-behaved. The room was quite large by European standards - King size bed, closet, minibar, etc. Bathroom was large with separate tub and shower and toilet stall. The lobby was nice and the cafe, bar and restaurant appeared upscale though we didn't use them. They do charge for internet usage on a two-tier basis: business (higher bandwidth) and economy. The economy 'version' worked just fine for web-surfing and Skype phone calls so skip the more expensive business option. It's a ten minute walk to Central Station and the various tour options, ten minutes to the less-touristy and quite nice Jordaan neighborhood, Anne Frank house, etc. I'm not convinced its a five-star property, but it served as a great base of operations for visiting most of the city and was easy to navigate from. Generally found the staff to be friendly and accomodating (they took off a mistake charge for the minibar with no fuss at all).

I have wanted to stay at this hotel for a while but we always ended up staying elsewhere. I was adamant that we stayed here this time. I was a little disappointed with the rooms. We stayed in a superior room which had just been renovated. It was clean and new, but I found it very cold looking, small and just pretty basic. I cant imagine what the standard rooms looked liked. For example there was hard wood floors with no rug, and room was all white. I like minimalist but the way it was done just looked like not much expense went into it and seemed very bare. If it was a 4 star hotel and I walked into that room I would have been perfectly satisfied, probably even pleased. It is a 5 star hotel but definitely more of a 4 star. However the location does make up for a lot. The breakfast was fabulous and had a great selection and was served in a lovely conservatory. The apple pie at the restaurant is also to die for! Best I have ever had! Reception staff were very friendly. Parking ridiculously expensive 55 Euro a night (we stayed for 5 nights), but that serves me right for taking a car into Amsterdam Centrum!

For one night, we spent 150GBP. Personally, I didn't think there was anything at this hotel that you couldn't get anywhere else. The room was clean and comfortable, but it wasn't anything overly special. I also didn't appreciate the loitering that occurred in the hotel lobby by people who were clearly not guests at the hotel - it got pretty noisy and crowded to the point that they littered the lobby and basically caused a ruckus, while the hotel staff did next to nothing about it. I will note, however, that the service we received from the front desk and concierge was fabulous.

We enjoyed having an electric kettle, plenty of drinking glasses and a mini bar. The conference facilities were great! Good coffee/water/snacks/meals. Cons: Our bathroom needed updating. The floor and walls seemed dirty since the tiles/floor is older. There was a very bad smell (mold maybe?) in our hallway outside our room. The hallway had windows which were open to help ventilation, but for people with allergies this is not ideal. Our upstairs neighbors were so noisy.

There are many options so if you're a big eater then you may be able get your money's worth. Earlier in the day is best since the food seems the freshest.

The rooms were quite minimal but very comfortable with great beds, fab showers, safe, mini bar and huge tv. The air conditioning if the room temp was set high was a little loud but that was a minor complaint. Everything was spotlessly clean. There was a complementary adapter which was a pleasant surprise and a comprehensive range of toiletries. Mini bar works on pressure sensors so if you removed items to place other stuff in the fridge the hotel thinks you have used stuff - beware!

The hotel is fantastically located on Dam Square, which is at most a ten minute walk from the railway station. From the outsude, the hotel is nothing special to look at, although I suspect that is more to do with the central location than anything else. Inside, the hotel is smart and clean, albeit perhaps slightly faded in parts. On arrival, we asked if we could have a room upgrade. Whilst this was offered, it was at a cost and we politely declined. We were allocated room 1082, which was located on the first floor. The room was large, recently redecorated and comfortable. The bed was king size - absolutely massive. My only complaint would be that the bathroom was constructed of an opaque partition, rather than having its own walls, so wasn't as private as one may wish. Whilst not a ptoblem for my wife and I, I wouldn't recommend it for a first date! The hotel bar was comfortable, atmospheric and stayed open until after 0100h, so was most impressive.

Check-in was fast, and they let us into our room at noon, after a long overnight flight, which was appreciated. The receptionist upgraded us to a \"deluxe\" room without added charge. Our US Airways vacation package apparently came with breakfast, so we were pleasantly surprised by the large buffet style breakfast every morning included in the hotel rate (eggs, waffles, pancakes, bacon, potatoes, fruit, breads, juices, teas, etc.). The hotel breakfast and restaurants were quite pricey, so you want to be sure to get breakfast included in your rate or possibly eat elsewhere. The breakfast area in the historic Winter Garden was quite nice, like eating in a ballroom or large atrium. We were placed in the Amsterdam Wing adjacent to the hotel in the old Salvation Army building. We really liked this wing, as all the rooms on 4-5 floors were modern and seemed recently renovated. Our fourth-floor room was large and had a great view of a side street leading into Dam Square. The room was well appointed with tv, mini bar, safe, wireless/wired internet access, robes, slippers, plenty of bathroom supplies refreshed daily, ice chest with convenient ice machine on hall, coffee/tea machine with complimentary packets, etc. Television programming was limited, showing mainly news programming in a half dozen languages, and only 3-4 English language channels including BBC 1-2 (i.e., snore). Our room had nice hardwood floors, as well as a big blow-out window that afforded good views, and the furnishings were modern. The bathroom was quite large with a big tub/shower, plenty of room on the vanity, and despite what others have said about water temperature, it didn't seem to be a huge problem. It fluctuated a little, but wasn't that bad, in our wing anyway. I will say this hotel sprawls across several buildings, so it may be a bit of pot luck, depending on where you get placed. The Amsterdam Wing, however, was quite nice. My only real complaint would be the lack of sheets on the bed. The bed only came with a thick down comforter, which was too heavy, leaving you with a choice of freezing with no covers or baking under a parka. Another small complaint would be the Internet access, which is 10 euros per day with limits placed on download/upload, our 17-18 euros per day business class with unlimited data. Speed did not seem to be an issue in the 10 euro economy class, but the limits on uploads were unusual and annoying on vacation, when trying to save a day's worth of images to Flickr. The location of this hotel can't really be beat. There is every type of food imaginable literally underneath the Amsterdam wing--asian, italian, argentinian steak, mexican, croissants, chocolates, etc., with tons of restaurants and tourist shops all around Dam Square. Most tram lines run through Dam Square, so you can get north, south, east, west, very easily. The walk to Central Station would be a bit far with luggage in tow (just under a mile), but it was easy to hop on a tram and go straight to the hotel/station in less than 5 minutes.

When I arrived there was nobody in front of the hotel to help me with the luggages. The corridors looks like in the '60's. As well as the design-if you can call it design at all!

The lighting is terrible, hardly can see anything, not really good for any makeup, unless you want to look like a clown by painting everything 2-3 cm's away from its places. The bathroom beauty supplies are very week and they smell terrible. There is no conditioner and the soap is sooo tiny, that it melts away after 2 minutes.

In terms of convenience - its hard to beat. It's about a 10 minute walk to the Centraal Train Station (but through cobblestone so make sure your roller can handle that), right in Dam Square and near light rail, restaurants and bars. Make sure to save your Euros since if you decide to take a cab the 0.5 miles to the Centraal train station it will cost you 12.50 EU! The hotel has a classy facade and you can tell that this hotel has been around a very long time. The furniture and architecture of the lobby speak to a bye-gone Victorian era. However, you don't have to live in the past once you enter your room - my room was Swedish modern down to the voyeuristic glass separating the bedroom from the shower. The bathroom is clean and modern although it is odd to have the door that opens to the bathroom double as the door to close the toilet. The room itself is very small - the chair for the desk was literally up against the bed but it worked for a short trip. I had a wonderful view of the room across from me who I am sure didn't appreciate having a neighbor so close. However, this translated to a much quieter experience since the room was away from the noise of the square. Other than the small room, one thing that I didn't like was that internet access wasn't free (a must for a business trip). The breakfast was also quite expensive so I avoided that although I will say that the Winter Garden (in which breakfast was served) is very nice. Other than that, the service was pleasant if not exactly efficient. An interesting option should you need it is that you can stay later on Sundays without extra charge. On other days, you are charged 30 EU for a check out at 3pm. There is also an even later check-out time for even more money (but less than paying for a full night). Quite useful if you like sleeping in or have other business to attend to that will require a later check-out.

Its about two blocks from the red light district (if thats your thing), within an easy walk to public transportation and places to eat. I would recommend price comparison shopping within the block of dam square to see prices of other hotels, however this one was worth the money and is definately a strong contender. I highly recommend the Iamsterdam card because it allows access to a multitude of museum's a few at dam square. We will return to Amsterdam, however we never stay at the same place twice.

It was about a 20 min drive from the airport and was 40 euros. Probably could have been cheaper but we were just eager to get there. The hotel really is in the center of the city. The lobby was okay. Service was slow at check in as the receptionist checking us in was constantly interrupting us to answer the phone as other workers were standing by. The elevators were tucked far away from the reception in an area that looked nothing like the lobby. It was near conference rooms and had a completely different feel. The room itself was very clean and modern. We had a great view. The bed was not very comfortable and the 2 pillows were extremely flat. The shower/tub can be dangerous. I fell getting out of the tub because it is very deep and there are no rugs on the floor or anything to hold on to.

Overall, it's a good hotel, but it's not a 5 star. The staff is terrific. They speak perfect English, they are so nice, and they are great about giving directions and helping you find things. The lobby is spacious and gorgeous. The location can't be beat. It's easy to find and right in the center of things. There's a tram stop across the plaza, and you can walk to many attractions from the hotel, including the Anne Frank House, the Red Light District, Old Church, many coffee shops, and de Poizen boot. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. There is a restaurant there, but it's pretty pricey so we didn't partake. The bathroom had some big problems though. When we first checked in, our non-smoking room was fine, but the bathroom absolutely reeked of cigarette smoke. We called down and they sent someone up with air freshener and that did the trick. I found it rather annoying that the cleaning staff didn't notice and do something about that when they cleaned it. The other huge problem with the bathroom was that the shower water temperature would never stay where you put it. First of all, please know that this hotel LOVES its hot water. The hot water was scalding, so not much was needed. However, the shower continually vacillated between pleasantly warm, scalding hot, and freezing cold. With no pattern to anticipate those very unpleasant changes. Needless to say, we took extremely fast showers! Another problem we experienced is that the hallways always smelled like poop. I don't know why, but you were hit with it every time we exited our room. My last complaint is that the rooms had no free wi-fi, and the price for it was exorbitant. I've stayed in enough hotels that provide wi-fi in the rooms to know it's not that big a deal anymore, so a purportedly 5 star place really should provide that with no problem.

Pro's: ~ Helpful and diverse staff at the front desk, they were all fluent in English and some were fluent in other European languages. Eager to help and very efficient even at busy times, especially with things like ordering taxis, dinner reservations, room service arrangements etc. ~ Excellent Location; right opposite the Palace, easy to get on to public transport and within reach of all main attractions in the city. (Not too far from the airport either, although this would depend on traffic) ~ Room size is large and spacious, the cleaning of the room is done to a high standard, which is something you appreciate when living out of a suitcase for extended periods of time! ~ Very high standard of food and catering, professional staff willing to help and advise. 24 hour Breakfast and Room service is always on time (if not early!). Definitely worth tipping! ~ The TV and Mini Bar services are ofcourse pricey (as they would be in a 5* establishment), but are of a good standard - the Mini Bar/Fridge is constantly topped up by staff for your convenience. ~ Shower and bathroom facilities are fantastic, the beds are comfy and pillows can be requested to suit your preference. The safe in the room is discreet compared to those of many other hotels, so it is worth putting your valuables in them. ~ All looked very elegant and well lit, the Winter Garden is a great place to take guests and make an impression. I assume it is also a family friendly for those looking for a short but luxurious holiday. Con's: * Room key was problematic at times, and in the end had to get it changed - this can be highly irritating if your are in a hurry or have arrangements. * The lights can be slow and flicker several times before coming on to full power - not a huge issue but when it happens all the time it can bother you when going about day to day activities. * The gym was small and cramped, easily over crowded. * Bar was also overpriced and relatively small, seemed very dull indeed, especially for such a hotel. * WiFi in your room was very expensive and hard to pickup in other areas of the hotel. * I noticed at certain times the front desk had not even one single member of staff available, which can be frustrating if you are in a hurry. * Long wait for elevators and Air con in the room can noisy.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location!\u201d", "Author": "FlyingWakame", "ReviewID": "UR118504384", "Content": "No other place can beat the location if you like to walk around, take tram etc. A bit 70's big hotel atmosphere.

My room was on a gallery accessible only by a steep and narrow stairway.

But unfortunaly poor management has resulted in poor renovations and a catastrophically bad front desk staff. First, the renovations: I had been at this hotel many years ago and it was saddening to see that the renovation that happened in between didn't do this historic building any favors. If anything now the hotel feels less upscale and less luxurious. And yes, I'm talking about the rooms facing the Dam, because the rest of the rooms - especially the ones in the \"new\" wing in the back, between the Pijlsteeg and the Damstraat, are a complete disaster. That brings me to the front desk staff; every interaction with them was unpleasant, from check-in to check out. At check-in, we saw that they had a promotion about upgrading from the booked room, so we asked. After being told the promo was only for special circumstances and we weren't a special circumstance (bait'n'switch, anyone?) we were offered an expensive upgrade to an \"executive room\" in the \"new wing\". We decided to give that a try, and hauled our heavy bags all the way to the \"new wing\". Well, the room was catastrophically bad and amongst other offenses even though it was non-smoking it smelled of smoke - very intensely. We went back and ended up paying a huge premium to get a Dam room, which were still disappointing but not nearly as bad. The fabulous breakfast kept us going for the rest of the stay, but check-out was just as much of a mess, if not worse; they basically messed up the bill, including the fact that they charged us for the upgrade during a day we didn't stay there... This was corrected after much grumbling from the staff, which was consistently unpleasant and rude. I do totally understand that they have to deal with bad customers every day (there were a few that we saw ourselves) but just because the previous customer was rude and unreasonable doesn't mean it should be contagious and you need to also be rude and unpleasant to the next customer - like if two wrongs made a right...", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Erlangen", "Title": "\u201cPerfect\u201d", "Author": "oxymoron2010", "ReviewID": "UR109355977", "Content": "The location of the hotel in the center of city close to Dam square is superb.

Once we got back to reception the lady at the check in desk apologised and offered us a free upgrade to an apartment which was a bonus. The apartments were great, and extremely clean. They were also at the back of the hotel, so very quiet, with easy access to the streets to the rear of the hotel, although the stairs are mental...quite dangerous actually as they're so steep. The location is the main selling point of the hotel. It's on Dam Square, so in the centre of everything, and 500m walk from central station. It's literally a straight road as well all the way, so very easy to find. I'd challenge whether this is a 5*. The original room we went to (the single room) was tiny, and furnished randomly, but the staff, the services, and the breakfast room were all great. At best, I'd say it was a good 4*, but you'd probably expect a more modern hotel with spa and more leisure facilities to qualify this to be classed as a 5*. On hindsight, we'd probably not pay the same rate we did to stay here again, but the lack of * is made up for with such a great location...that's definitely what you're paying for. p.s. put about \u00c2\u00a325 to one side for tourist taxes when you check out.

We booked this hotel on booking.com as it seemed incredible value for money. A 5-star hotel that was only slightly more expensive than the other 3-star hotels! Of course we did not realise that a 5-star hotel can have rooms that are at the most on a 3-star level. When we received our room keys after checking in we were informed that Lift 5 would be the one that would take us to our floor. Little did we know that this was the loser lift! The way to Lift 5 is past the main restaurant (the \"monumental winter garden\"), which is very pretty (wrought iron & glass roof) and really lifts your expectations. Marvelling about the comforts of staying at a 5-star hotel, we continued on our way to Lift 5. After the great restaurant the hotel seems to loose one of its stars with every step you take. Lift 5 is next to the door to the garage. After a very long walk (the hotel claims that the station is 5 minutes away - that would make the station closer to reception than our room!), we finally reached our room and realised why this had been such a good deal. The room was in desperate need of refurbishment and felt very dark und gloomy. The bathroom was clean but very basic, with doors that appeared to have been taken off an Ikea cupboard, i.e. they would not close properly and could not be locked. As there was no ventillation built into the bathroom any odors have to be absorbed by the bedroom (easily achieved as the bathroom doors don't close properly anyway). The hotel charges \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17 per day for wireless internet, not something that I would expect to pay for anymore. We told the front desk staff that the 5 stars were a gross exaggeration for what we got and the answer was \"yes we know\"! Here's a great tip for your next trip to Amsterdam: stay at a 3-star hotel and hang around the reception desk at the Krasnapolsky when people check in and enjoy the sight of guests happily taking their keys with the instruction to take Lift 5!", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cStingy\u201d", "Author": "misschrisUk", "ReviewID": "UR99433025", "Content": "My boyfriend and I got a great deal so I am not too miffed about the few problems we experienced, but if I was paying top dollar (\u00c2\u00a3120 a night) I would be fuming! We stayed in 6016 in a standard double room on the top floor. It is a smoking room as requested but did not stink at all. The bed was HUGE, about 50% bigger than a standard double. Very comfortable, lovely clean sheets and great quality pillows and duvet. On checking in we asked for the mini bar to be emptied as we wanted to use the space for groceries. We were assured it would be - it never was. We could have reminded them and asked again for it to be emptied but we didn't want the hassle. A big niggle was the bathroom doors - they are 'saloon' style swinging doors so you can forget about privacy! The bath was lovely - really big and deep. The toiletries were pretty paltry - one teeny tiny toothpaste tube which was barely enough to last one day. No conditioner or bubble bath - I used the shower gel instead but it didn't bubble very much. We had a lovely fluffy robe on day one but it was not replaced on either of the three other days we were there! The kettle took 10 minutes to boil and the complimentary tea/coffee/milk/sugar was very stingy - you can make 1 coffee and 1 tea with what they give you but it has to be very strong as there is so little milk/whitener! We treated ourselves to the famous buffet breakfast one morning. Very good, great choice and quality, but definitely not worth 45 Euros between us. The location is fantastic and as we were at the back we had no problems with noise. None of these problems are huge and did not spoil our holiday, just made it less comfortable.

The hotel is in a good location, near the main train station, restaurants, souvenir shops and the palace. There is a tram that takes you to the Museum area from behind the palace. We reserved a room rate that included breakfast, late check out on Sunday, free use of mini-bar. We booked a standard rate however after going back and reading some of the reviews on Tripadvisor I tried to upgrade to a deluxe room three hours before our arrival via internet. Their internet site would not let me upgrade to a deluxe room but I figured since the room was still available three hours before our arrival it would be ok. I asked for the upgrade upon check in and was told that the hotel was fully booked. hmm ok. It was January, not high tourist season and its a big hotel but oh well. We were given our room keys and walked to the left of the hotel...this is where you need to be careful. If you are given a room in the old part of the hotel, you better prepare yourself psychologically for a return to summer camp. A previous poster posted a photo of the bathroom, shower stall, toilet stall set up. My mistake was to look at that photo and say to myself that must have been some years ago but no 5 star hotel could have such a nasty bathroom set up in this day and age. Well let me tell you...in 2011 it is still that cheap camp site bathroom set up and guests are being put in these rooms. It looked like if you showered the entire water would spread between the stalls into the toilet and would get flooded. As we were three persons we knew there would be a third bed. Well, there was a really tatty old rollaway bed that looked more like a prison bed than a 5 star hotel bed. The room was so dark despite having turned on all the lights. I have stayed in one star hotels that had a better room and bathroom situation than this.... Immediately we telephone reception to say we needed to change rooms and were told that a junior suite room was available (except the hotel was fully booked 10 minutes earlier at Reception). In any case we were told the suite room would be an extra 200euros more than our current room rate but because the bathroom situation was so terrible we decided that we needed to pay that amount to get out of the room. It was that bad. I wonder if they put people in those scary rooms and then try to sell a more expensive suite room once guests are sufficiently horrified. So we moved to the new room, the junior suite was much better...more 5 star. Nice bathroom with jacuzzi tub, walk in shower, big dining table with dishes, flatscreen tv, two sofas, many closets and comfortable beds. I was promised the new rate included the same package deal, breakfast, late check out and free use of mini bar. Well, when checking out we had been billed for every item taken from the mini bar so be careful and check your bill upon check out. Breakfast was very nice (go for the waffles with cherry sauce!) . So if you can spring for the nicest hotel rate (I hope this ensures a room in the new section) or get guarantee that you are not going to be put in the old unrenovated part of the hotel, go for it. I put an average rating because that first room is not 5 star and I don't think even 20-30 years ago that room would have been labelled a 4-5 star room... If I had booked the suite and had only seen the suite I would give this hotel an excellent rating.

Friday to the Monday. We had been looking forward to staying somewhere a little more upmarket in Amsterdam. First impressions were good, lovely architecture and styling within the lobby however there was a very long wait to get served at the Reception. Once we were served we got a free upgrade to a delux suite which was unexpected. The room was very comfortable and had every need that you wished for. Very comfortable bed and a new bathroom. We had the breakfast 3 of the days and it was just okay. The bacon, sausage, egg ..etc was all over cooked, I would say the best thing was the champagne. The breakfast room was very nice again but really let down by the poor quality in food. On the Sunday the manual in the bedroom said that breakfast would be until 11:30am on sundays but when we went down they then said it was closed to due brunch, but we could pay an extra 10euros if we wanted. Needless to say we didn't want to pay extra for something that we though was included. We went off looking for a place for breakfast and found a bar called Big Shots which done a lovely English Breakfast and certingly the best we had over there. I guess this leads us on to the one downfall of the hotel and that is the staff. From Reception to the concerige at night, to asking for advice it was all very poor. My partner and I are early 20's and I got the feeling that people in the hotel were looking down on us. The first night that we were there when we walked in to the hotel lobby and one of the staff questioned us and kept asking what our room number was. Once she got an answer she stormed down the reception area speaking to a collegue in dutch and marched in to a room at the back of the reception area. I got the feeling that we weren't the usual guests she was expecting! One our holiday we like to relax in the hotel room in the afternoon after being out and about. We had left a sign on the door advising staff not to disturb us, we recieved a call later afternoon from house keeping asking when we wanted our room cleaned, as it was already around 6pm when they called we told them to leave it. We headed out and had dinner when we arrived back in at 8pm the room had been done. This left a sour taste as we had told the staff to leave the room unitl the next day. There was one other event on the Sunday we arrived back in the hotel room around 5pm and house cleaning had been, about 5 minutes later we recieved a chap at the door from housekeeping asking if we needed anything else? I just didn't understand this as room keeping had been and changed everything for us, even supplying new toothbrushes as well. Now maybe they were just trying to give us good service but it really didn't feel like that at all.

I had visited Amsterdam many times in years gone by and thought of the Kraznapolsky as out of my league (it is rated as a 5 star hotel ... and from the outside looks quite posh). However, found a great deal on the internet for a weeekend break so decided to try for my self. The hotel has a lot of history, but you probably won't find any of it. It's all very dated 80's style. The room we had was large (for Amsterdam), it had a massive King Size bed, tv, lovely bathroom and a small table and chair set. The view was ok but then we were on the sixth floor of one of the back buildings so overlooked the Amsterdam skyline. The hotel seems to be made up of several buildings and I felt sorry for anyone who was in the royal suite as their view would be overlooking another window or worse still a brick wall... so all in all, I felt quite lucky with the view I had. By the way, don't even think of opening the fridge. Just move a can of drink (not actually drink it) and somehow it's automatically added to your bill (even if you put it back in place) ... never had this at any hotel I have stayed before, but never stayed at a NH hotel before so perhaps this is common to them ... Check-in is quite late (3pm) but then check-out is quite late (12 noon) or 5pm on Sundays). Breakfast is the best bit I think. Served in the Winter Gardens ( a huge conservatory style building), it's a buffet eat as you will style affair. Hot and cold dishes, fruit and cereal and even a glass of cava for breakfast .... The only slight criticism I would have is that whilst they do have a plate warmer it is not on so plates are stone cold ... add to this buffet food is warm not hot ... by the time you get back to your table it's probably cold ... Still plenty of it and quite tasty. All in all, slightly underwhelming ... it's not really five star ... rather a conference centre than a posh hotel.

Avoid bars on the square they charge you double the price for drinks and also be aware that you have to pay city tax which cost us an extra 21 euro's. If you are visiting museums etc get an I Amsterdam card that will save you a few euro's. We also went to the Supper Club which I recomend the hotel booked it for us and printed off the booking which was a good thing because they tried to charge us an extra 40 euro's so if we didn't have it we would of had to pay!!

Upon checking in, we were assured we had not only been given a room type as requested, but had also been upgraded to the 'Royal Wing'. Don't be drawn in... the royal wing is the new part of the hotel that has been done up like a travel lodge. After finding our room, which was adequate - as a travel lodge always is, we realised we had 2 separate single beds, that had been pushed together, with separate duvets and sheets. Not only that, but the room was on a very low first floor, making you feel as if everyone on the street outside could see straight in. When we rang the front desk to ask to be moved to the type of room they had assured us in an email 2 days earlier we would have, we were told they were full, and there was no chance of moving until the nest day. So the next day we moved, to a much nicer room on a higher floor with a good view. We were then very pleased, and thought maybe we had been wrong to judge the hotel initially. However, within 30 minutes of being in the room we were plunged into darkness. None of the lights would turn on. Someone attempted to fix them but was unable to, and we were not offered to move rooms. Upon checking out we told the receptionist of the problem with the lights and were not offered any conpensation whatsoever, in fact we were barely thanked for letting them know for future guests.

Bath All the amenities are there (including extras like toothbrush, shaving kit, sponge, body lotion) but NH urgently needs to improve on its \"Aqua de la tierra\" cosmetics/shampoo line with its cheap and aggressive smell of tangerines.

It has been operated as part of several hotel chains in it's time and is currently an NH Hotel. The Spanish influence is noticeable, and the cheerful branding and colourful attitude of NH sits quite well alongside a hotel that has a mix of old Dutch style and new modern extensions and annxes. We have stayed at the K many times over the year and it offers good quality in a city sometimes thought of as a hostel haven. The rooms vary from very modern to dated, but housekeeping is diligent and performed well. The TV system was problematic, rebooting itself repeatedly, and maintenance never managed to fix it. I could attach an external media player using SCART, but it took help from maintenance. The restaurant, like many Amsterdam hotel restaurants, is high class and is open and used by non-residents as well as guests. The \"tea-room\" next to reception is an excellent place to drink coffee and eat apple pie whilst looking out onto Dam Square. There is no pool, as has become the norm for Amsterdam hotels. The conference facilities are good, and the hotel is quite vast and yet doesn't feel overwhelming. There is a wide range of Wireless Internet options in the room, with varying service levels and prices, and 30 minutes of free WiFi in the main hotel lobby. The breakfast buffet at the K is a high point. In a lovely glass roofed Winter Garden room a buffet of food that covers European to USA diets (not Asian tho') is displayed beautifully as a chef prepares omelettes, eggs, pancakes [Poffertjes] and waffles in the centre. Truly a great breakfast and served until late most days. The hotel also has an \"Endless Sunday\" with very late breakfast times and automatic late checkouts on Sundays, and this is a great treat.

Amsterdam is lovely very lively in places, but quite expensive, we had a drink in the bar next to the hotel 1 pint of lager and a half of bitter 12 euro's so try and drink in places a bit further from the square. We found a supermarket at the back of the Palace which is over the road from the Hotel everything is really cheap so try shopping there, they have fantastic take away salads which are very reasonable, lovely for a picnic in the lovely parks they have there. We also found a lovely canal boat which serves food and drink and you are right on the canal, it is not far from the Anne Frank house.

I am vegetarian so I snacked on pizza and chips, they have places called Wok and Go which sell noodles etc they are everywhere, they also sell lovely cream cakes they are something else, so don't think you will go hungrey Its is very lively but if you walk out of the main centre around the canals you will find some beautiful canals very quiet bars etc and it is a completely different experience.

Amazing views from the room and sufficient space for 2 people and twin beds. The furniture however outdates even Classic style. Beds are very comfortable and the cleanliness is somewhat satisfactory. I absolutely did not like the Dutch toilet which is facing the wrong way. Although I never seen a larger bathroom in any other hotel. There was separate toilet, seperate shower and separate bath all with indvidual doors !!! Air conditioning is weak and more or less like a mouse coughing on you in an annoying way but it does make a noise. Tea & Coffee facilities are provided but under provided with sugar and milk.

We walked ten minutes directly opposite from the station to the Grand Krasnapolksy (AMS consists of cobbled streets so wear good walking shoes and trolley suitcases!!) and it is a striking hotel in Dam Square. The staff were talking amongst themselves and after a few minutes of waiting attended to us. As we were the only ones there, we were checked in promptly and upgraded to a the Amsterdam Wing (a part of the hotel which you need separate key cards to access). We also had the lazy Sunday included in our package. I think from reading previous reviews on tripadvisor, that for this 3 day package, or long stays they give you the newer rooms? Not sure what the hotel policy is. A member of staff carried our suitcase to our room. Our room was 6135 and it was a new room, walk-in-wardrobe, wooden floors, separate desk, wide screen TV that for some reason kept going on and off?? at times. Air conditioning does not work, so we kept our balcony door ajar (was safe as is 6 floors up but did let in the noise from the restaurants below. The minibar is one of those that automatically charges to your room if you take anything out, so remember not to touch anything unless you want to pay for it. The bathroom was large, with a lovely power shower and bath and all the normal toiletries. The hairdryer did not work, but I only found out on the day of check-out. There is a safe and tea and coffee making facilities. We were given bathrobes and slippers also. There is also a large balcony and the window opens out fully with some help from a member of staff. Is handy for smokers. On checkout, and other parts of the day, we did notice extremely long queues and guests having to wait a very long time to check-in and the staff did say that the rooms weren't clean, I think maybe they need more cleaning staff. My room was cleaned daily and to a high standard but I think with this hotel, it maybe that they put couples who want some special or quiet time in separate rooms to big groups. We got a free voucher to use the internet in the business centre also on the last day to print out our boarding passes. The hotel is within walking distance to all the sights(Red Light District, Anne Frank House, Van Gogh Museum) in that order also the shops, restaurants, coffee shops, pancakes places etc...We also stumbled upon the Love Life Festival for cancer and there are raves in areas (this one was near the Red Light District) and rounded off our trip nicely! All was so civilised, no rowdiness at all! Dutch are really friendly people! If you are going to AMS this summer, do book online for as much as you can, or you will end up in very very long queues!!

We ended up being lumped in that section where the rooms were like a 2 star budget motel. The real issue is that this hotel's management does not respond to serious complaints. The hotel booked me an airport shuttle where the driver threatened me for 5 times the fare quoted by the hotel staff. I was released once screaming for the police. I later complained to the hotel a few times and they still have not replied and clearly do not care that they are partly responsible for customer's safety.

The hotel is located right in the centre of Amsterdam, a five minute walk up the Damrak from Centraal Station. We arrived on Queen's Day, a feast day celebrating the birthday of Queen Beatrix, and had to walk from the station as the roads were closed to trams and taxis. This was not a problem as the sun was shining and there was a carnival atmosphere. Our problems started on checking in. We were allocated room 1108 which was small and definitely not my idea of 5*. We asked to change rooms and were told that it would be possible if we had not settled into 1108. As we had not unpacked I left my wife at the desk to sort out the formalities while I went upstairs to remove our cases from the room. When I came down my wife was walking towards me and informed me that they would not exchange rooms. I then went to the reception where I explained that my wife was very upset and that our 5* treat was being ruined right from the start. Then all of a sudden they found us an alternative room 1002 which was much better but still not 5* in my opinion. I have read reviews here that you pay for location and whilst that may be true to some extent, if a hotel advertises itself as 5* then you should expect 5* facilities. If I was to put up a tent on Dam Square would I be able to classify it as 5* just because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Dam Square? I think not. I have stayed in better 3* and 4* hotels - this hotel was 4* at best in my opinion. Also the hotel was very expensive. Fortunately I had booked a package including breakfast and mini-bar. Breakfast for those who had not pre-paid was a staggering \u00e2\u201a\u00ac28.50 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yes the breakfast is very good but \u00e2\u201a\u00ac28.50 good? Also mini-bar prices were high with two vodka and cokes costing \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20. We also had a look at the hotel bar prices and decided to drink out, and judging by the emptiness of the bar, so had everyone else. All in all we enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam but the hotel is definitely over-rated and very expensive. I did not mind paying what I did because of the location and the inclusive breakfast/mini-bar package but I could have stayed in a hotel with similar facilities in the same area for a lot less. I could recommend this hotel to a friend but only if the price was right.

I stayed in the wing that was across the courtyard, so the only annoying thing was that it was cold when I would pass from my room to the main hotel and the 3 times I had to use my key before I could access my room. But the room was a good size (I had what seemed like 2 doubles pushed together). It was always clean and the bed was comfortable. My suggestion to the hotel though is that the TV channels could be improved because it was fairly limited for an international hotel. The best thing about the hotel has got to be the staff though. They were so helpful and it was pretty chaotic there with all the hotel guests. I have to admit we were pretty demanding and they were always very pleasant and calm. Every day they helped us call the airline and by day 2 called my room by 9am to let me know we could stay an extra night. It helped relieve some of the stress from the situation since otherwise I didn't know where I was going to stay. They went beyond what I expected and even knew all our names by the 3rd day we were there (I stayed 6 nights). The location can't be beat....there are trams right outside the hotel and the train station is just a 5 min. walk. It's a pretty area to walk around, with plenty to see and shopping.

It is called the Wynand Fockink and it is a little pub - no seats, music, nothing - just loads and loads of flavoured gins to try which are fantastic (if you don't like the taste of gin don't let that put you off). On our first visit of many we spoke to the barman for advice as we didn't know where to start. He then asks you questions about what type of tastes you like and presents you with a drink.

As you enter dam sq the hotel is over on the left. the lobby is huge, nicely decorated but a bit busy, we were only 10 mins checking in and found the staff very friendly, plus they all spoke english. the hotel do take \u00e2\u201a\u00ac150 from your credit card should you decide to use the mini bar etc but this is not charged to your card upon checkout, its a security measure should you do a runner. the hotel itself i would prob compare to a 4 star hotel here in ireland but good compared to some european hotels i have stayed in. the room 1025 was huge, well lit, with a monstrous bed sooooooo comfty. we really enjoyed our stay. there was a bath, seperate shower basic bathroom, basic but clean. regarding the attractions around the hotel, if you walk out of the lobby and turn left and left again the red light district is about 5 mins walk down the street and well worth a visit, i would advise visiting during the day as its mostly drunk or stoned males at night wondering around. a bit pervy for me but a giggle all the same. as you would walk along this street there is a lovely cafe where you can get lovely coffee and pastries yum!!!! i think its called rene crossaints. for eating in the evening we ate in the same place each night, o reilly's bar. the food was class, and very reasonable, 9-10 euro for main course. the staff were really nice. to find this pub walk out the hotel door straight acoss the sq keeping to the left of the palace and across about three streets and its on your left. it also had all the soccer matches on big screen tv's. nice one. the only down fall is they charged \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7 for pint bottle magners but pints of local beer are about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.80. i wouldnt advise eating in any restaurants around dam sq they are mad expensive \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 for a simple main course. mad!!!!!! the ice bar and heineken brewery are just a tram away and while a bit expensive worth a visit. take tram 9 it will cost about a euro each and you can buy tickets from the driver. if its shopping your into there is a shopping street beside madame tussudes its huge with loads of shops but clothes are fairly expensive if its anne franks house you want to visit just keep walking past o reillys pub and take 2n right its about 10 mins walk down that street but huge queues. better to get there early in the morning. to visit the sex musuem its on your right as you walk from central station toward dam sq. we relly enjoyed pur stay and would have no problem returning to this hotel, and would have no problem recommending this hotel to my family members. i dont know what some of the reviewers are on about. anyway enjoy", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201chotel took half our spending money on checking in!\u201d", "Author": "skintscotland", "ReviewID": "UR56971907", "Content": "On checking into hotel,imagine our complete shock when we were told we had to hand over 300euro deposit for 3 nights[half our spending money!]i was advised that this was in case we used any facilities within hotel during our 3 nights and we would be given a refund on check out if we did not use any facilities ie,drinks from mini bar etc.every morning while we were just out of bed there was a knock on our door and a member of staff would come in to open mini bar and count items[we found this to not only be very intrusive but very insulting to say the least]when i go on a much needed break the last thing I expect is for someone to be knocking at my room door in the early hours expecting to enter my room and check mini bar.the price of breakfast is well over the top for what was on offer.i also feel that although some of the staff were friendly enough they could be doing with some customer service training in good manners.the hotel was situated in an excellent position near a wealth of amenities but to rate it 5 star is over the top.oh and just to say that we were not the only guests to make a complaint about the 'deposit'on arrival!", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cOne of the tiniest rooms I have stayed in\u201d", "Author": "ordflyer", "ReviewID": "UR56604757", "Content": "Located on a square near the center of town, and conveniently located only about 5-7 minutes by walk away from Central Station, this hotel could be so much more.

We stayed mainly in the Rotterdam area but took a weekend trip to tour the city of Amsterdam and got to stay in the Krasnapolsky. This hotel is on Dam Square, which, if you've never been to Amsterdam, is the middle of the action. You want to be on it or near it. Everything is walking distance in Amsterdam, but this hotel is right in the thick of it. We took the train in and walked from the Central Station with our small luggage/backpacks. Some poor souls were wandering through the streets with their huge suitcases, not recommended, the streets are twisty, cobblestoned in places, rough, holey, and sometimes altogether dangerous for people on foot, let alone people lugging their life's possessions along with them, take a cab if you've got a bunch of stuff. I don't even know if there is parking, I wouldn't suggest driving in Amsterdam unless you're pretty seasoned to bikes, pedestrians, trams, trains, cars, whatever, going every direction at the same time, mainly headed at you it seems. The hotel lobby is lovely, photos of the crowned prince and his wife Maxima don the walls. Check in took at least 20 minutes and we didn't have any line, it just took that long. My mother in law was doing the talking and she is a native Dutch speaker so the language barrier was not the issue. It just took forever, but we finally got our keys. The rooms were very nice. Rooms 210 and 211, face a brick wall, but whatever, we didn't care. The hotel has a lot of nice wood furnishings, a large bed (even for USA standards, this bed was huge) and a nice bathroom, the bedding is divine, plush down pillow top comforter, nice pillows, bath robe in the room, and this was just a basic room, not fancy. The toilet paper is what I'd refer to as personal napkins....they are not on a roll, and sort of are like bifold paper towels, only tiny, so you might be surprised with the tiny toilet napkins, but that is a European thing I guess...whatever. They do give you very nice citrusy scented bath products. There is a safe in the room. We got passes for buy one get one free drinks in the bar - which is nice. Order a cheap drink first, then get your second drink free. margaritas are like $12.00 US at the bar, so order a heineken first $4.00 US and then get your free margarita! We toured the city and the hotel was always at our crossroads, so periodically we'd go to the hotel for the bathroom and to drop off souvenirs (since you normally have to pay for toilets in Europe, or there are none for the public, outside free standing male public no door urinals, which were funny.). We went to high tea the day of our arrival downstairs in the hotel restaurant, and sat by the windows facing Dam square watching the swarms of people move about. It was blissful. The high tea comes with looseleaf tea in two varieties, a myriad of petit fors, finger sandwiches, chocolates, and crumpets, and champagne, Well worth your money. Also worth the money, the breakfast buffet in the Winter garden restaurant. Oh my gosh. After a week in Europe this American was excited about all you can eat (laugh but it's true, we like our free refills and all you can eat buffets, and no I'm not a big person, I just like a variety). This buffet had everyting, bacon, eggs, toast, waffles, cheeses, fruit, breads, milk, many juices, and champagne. I made a mimosa (champagne + Orange Juice) and a German guy stared me down like I was a moron for putting juice in my champagne, then I saw him do the same, and then suddenly the whole room had them and we were out of champagne. So, things to remember, get the breakfast, it's worth it, use the coupons in the bar but get a cheap drink first to make the second one really count, the high tea is also awesome. The staff's nametags have little flags to show what languages they speak, and in our experience, some people working there weren't native Dutch, most people working in Amsterdam as a whole seemed to be from somewhere else, my in laws ordered dinner in Dutch somewhere and the waiter didn't get it until I said it in English to the guy, I ordered in plain english and he had no trouble.", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cMixed bag of tears & smiles\u201d", "Author": "CAH000", "ReviewID": "UR41603835", "Content": "We booked from Friday to Monday into this hotel and was from the work go very disappointed.

We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any of the vermin mentioned in other reviews, or the long check in queues, but the hotel misses on getting the basics right for a so-called five star hotel. For example, they offer a multitude of pillow types, but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to clean your room properly, or teach their staff how to deal with customers properly. One real treat was halfway through our stay we were unexpectedly checked out, no reason given or no apology, just a shrug of the shoulders. Thankfully nothing was removed from the room, but hardly reassuring of their hotel management or customer service skills. On the pro side, great location for the train station and sights, but can be a bit noisy outside, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for quiet location, this is not the hotel for you. The breakfast is amazing, the strong point of this hotel stay. Served in the impressive Winter Garden, it has one of the largest selections of breakfast items I have ever seen. But do get this included in your room rate if possible, otherwise you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to bring your house deeds as a down payment. Our room was in the Royal Wing, and was large, pleasant and comfortable. Great bed, everything worked, a small kettle and tea/coffee were provided, good selection of toiletries, and an okay range of channels on the TV. They have a free late checkout and late breakfast times on Sunday, very handy if you are out partying on Saturday night and are checking out on the Sunday. But on the negative side, there is no free WiFi/Wired Internet access and the cost for using either is ridiculously high. The room cleaning is appalling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the chambermaid barely made the bed, rarely cleaned, and on two of the six days didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean or restock the bathroom. Our room had one of those really, really annoying pressure sensitive minibars where if you open the door, it bills half the contents to your room, followed by the inevitable 5 minute discussion with the reception to have these removed from the bill as they look at you like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a liar. The fitness centre has no pool and is a bit of a joke, to be honest. I have to agree with some of the other reviews that this is not a 5 star hotel, and certainly the decor could so with a little updating, but overall the stay was good and the location is great. Not sure if I would return here on my next visit though, you could probably do better for less cost. We used the train to and from Schiphol Airport, and with Amsterdam Centraal only 10 minutes walk away, it was a quick, cheap and reliable way to get to and from the airport. Train journey was under 15 minutes and trains are very regular. If you have a day or two to spare, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend a day trip to Haarlem, only 20 minutes away by train, and is a beautiful place to spend a day.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cThis could have been sooo very good...\u201d", "Author": "Goldfrapper", "ReviewID": "UR35970544", "Content": "All my previous trips to Amsterdam had been 3* and if you've done 3* central Amsterdam you'll know the 'steep stairs to a shoebox with half-a-window and catch-yourself-turning-round' story well. This time we went 4/5* (depending on which website you're looking at) central. The reception and front of house area were 'grand' in a tired, corporate kind of way so expectations were good. The room was a good size with a bed the size of a 3* room and a view out over the garden/terrace from a table and chairs in front of the window. The breakfast, in the Winter Garden, was fabulous. You name it and it was available: a glass of fizz to start your day, a selection of chopped up fresh fruit, smoked salmon, eggs benedict, a variety of fresh bread rolls, juices, yoghurt, cold cuts, cheeses, cooked breakfast etc. etc. This part of the stay really was top class and definitely 5*. In fact, all the ingredients were there for a damned (sic!) good stay... But, aside from the tired and imagination-free decor, some things just could not be ignored. The divan base had several very nasty and unseemly-looking stains along it that detered any application of imagination and should ideally have been cleaned off or at least covered up with a valance if time was short. It was the same story with one of the chairs. The bedsheet had a small but significant tear in it and nothing above average shoulder height had been dusted for some time. The window opened only four inches so we had to close it and have the noisy air conditioning on instead (which itself created problems of a malodorous nature) to cool the room down. In this day and age you'd expect free high speed internet but this was not the case, pity. These were problems of careless management which shouldn't have happened and which we did make them aware of so hopefeully they won't happen again. The hotel is fabulously central, about ten minutes walk from Central Station, and great for walking to the many bars and restaurants in the area. We didn't risk sampling the food or wine at the hotel as the prices forbade the risk of experiencing similar standards of hygiene that we found in the room around things we were going to eat and drink .

The building that the apartments are in is in the first block of the red light district. It added to the experience but women traveling alone might prefer to stay in the hotel itself since there was no direct access to the hotel without going outside. Breakfast in the Winter Garden was included in our room rate and it was a great way to start the day. The food selection on the breakfast buffet was amazing and it is a stunning room. A definite plus. Not sure we would have paid for it had it not been included since it is fairly pricey. Did not try any of the other restaurants or bars. Lobby was large and pleasant with lots of places to sit but not very glamorous. As mentioned by everyone else, the location is convenient, though not particularly picturesque due to lots of construction in the area and a sand volleyball tournament set up on the square. We took a day trip by train one day and it was nice to be able to walk to the central train station. We would also highly recommend the Hop On, Hop Off canal boats which can also be boarded at the train station. You get a 24 hour pass for 20 Euro and it is good on all three routes. A great way to see the city. The only negatives were how expensive the internet access was and that no one came to make up our room the first 2 days we were there. When we called to complain we were told that housekeeping services the apartments only upon request since most guests stay there an extended time. It makes sense but it would have been nice to have been told that upfront. We asked for towels and a brief cleaning and they were there within 30 minutes and housekeeping also came the following day without being asked so they recovered nicely.", "Date": "June 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich", "Title": "\u201cMuch better than the reviews suggested\u201d", "Author": "womantravelerZurich", "ReviewID": "UR31317772", "Content": "I was really worried about staying at this hotel after I read the reviews here.

The front desk clerk checked and I was given a spacious room with a king size bed, no problem. My room was in the main building on the 4th floor. My next worry was a stinky room, which was not the case at all. It smelled very pleasant. There was a window that I could open (which had a sliver of a view of the dam) and along with the airconditioning system I was able to air out the effects of my smoking. The bathroom was old and outdated but clean. I ate the breakfast buffet in the wintergarten one time. The selection and quality of the offerings were great, however as it was not included in my room rate I had to pay for it.

When one stays at a five star hotel, one expects a beautifully decorated room with Frette linens, high quality amenities and exceptional service. You will not find that here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what you will find is a very large room even by US standards, very basic furnishings, motel quality linens and average service. We clearly stated that we wanted a non-smoking room when we made our reservation; however, it seems that the staff defines smoking and non-smoking rooms by whether or not the guests in the room at that time smoke. Not only was our room a smoking room, but it was located off of a small ante room that was setup for smoking conference attendees. Just walking to the room was like walking through an ashtray. When I went to the front desk to request something be done about our room, the clerk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What do you want me to do about it?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Not exactly the level of service one would expect from a five star hotel. This is clearly a hotel that could do with an express check-out \u00e2\u20ac\u201cespecially since this is clearly a convention destination and they have large groups of people checking in and out at the same time. Although they did have several clerks staffing the front desk when we checked out, there was no organization of the lines and people generally ignored any sort of queuing. There are a number of restaurants in the hotel, but based on what we saw and heard from other guests, they are very expensive and not that good. Fortunately, there are plenty of choices in the area that are more reasonably priced and serve better food. What does this hotel have going for it? Location, location, location. It is located right on The Dam which makes it within a block or two of the tram stops to the museums, train station and other locations. In addition, it is just about a block to the Red Light District and on the same street as a number of fun clubs. If you are simply looking for a place to shower and sleep, this is an adequate choice, but if you are looking for the exceptional lodging experience one associates with a five star establishment, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to be sorely disappointed.

What may be acceptable to you, may not be to me, and vice versa. NH Krasnapolsky Grand Hotel Amsterdam 5* Rated 2 x weekday nights Location. Right on DAM square. A bustling tourist destination / hangout. Can get noisy especially at night. 5 mins walk from Central station. Great location for shopping, department stores, people watching etc. Mix of Business and Tourist clientele. Property: Ex Golden Tulip now owned and operated by Spanish group NH who have a very strong presence in Amsterdam today. Optimistically 5* rated. Some upgrades but dated in many areas. Check In: Busy check-in desk, pleasant and efficient. Was allocated the notorious Elevator # 5 wing. As has been reported, the rooms accessed thru the elevator # 5 portal, reflect the lower end of room quality at this property. I was prepared to go take a look before I asked for a room change. The room turned out to be small and unsatisfactory. Back at the desk after some to and fro, I was assigned 3rd floor in the main building. Much better. Clerk was not very cooperative and required some gentle coaxing on my part, but she came through. 7/10 Room: Bright and pleasant. 6/10 Large new flat screen. Selection of English channels. CNN, CNBC, BBC etc Tea coffee materials etc Mini Bar: Yes Closet stuff: In-room safe, iron, board etc Bed: King size. Hardish. I large duvet, nice pillows. 7/10 Desk and seating area. Good Wifi: Yes. In room and public areas. 11mbps @ Euro 10.7 per 24 hrs Bathroom: Clean. Selection of personal care products. Nice towels. What's close by: Pretty much everything, the location is geared towards the guest that came to experience what Amsterdam is famous for. Not unhappy to have ended up here on a low Priceline rate. Conclusion: A property in need of further modernization and upgrade. Excellent tourist location for all activities. If you get a good room it's acceptable. Stay again? Wouldn't choose this property.

I always stay in five star deluxe properties, usually I pay rates offered directly by the property. My favoured \"group\" (inverted commas as strictly speaking it is not a group, more an association) is The Leading Hotels Of The World whose members are nearly always excellent, and as a member of The Leaders Club I am usually rewarded with an upgrade. A very lastminute break to Amsterdam prompted me to deviate from my favoured properties (on previous trips I've stayed at Hotel Okura which in a sentence or so offers super service, excellent dining, a good pool, but a somewhat sterile atmosphere and away from the centre location) and try my hand on Priceline. A quick search on the internet revealed that the five star property in Amsterdam is the Krasnapolsky. I secured it at a rate of 60GBP per night including all taxes/fees. The position is as central as you can get, however, it is a little in the middle of the most tacky, touristy area, although a minute's walk and you can be in more pleasant surroundings. I liken its position to staying in Leicester Sq. (London). From the outside the buildings which comprise this property look tired, think \"fifties/sixties extensions\", and unattractive. The lobby is characterless, international, and lacking in any style whatsoever. There is not any hint of grandeur, and it feels like a four star Hilton at best. Check-in staff were efficient enough, but impersonal. I am used to hotel staff knowing which room I'm staying in etc. so if I casually pass the concierge/reception I can make a request without the need to recite my room number, no chance of that happening here. The first room I was allocated was in an older (sixties) part of the hotel. Decor was fresh from the seventies, a very grotty bathroom and a small bedroom which again was more reminiscent of a four star Hilton back in the early nineties. I promptly requested a change of room. This one was located in the \"Royal Wing\" (royal by name only it would seem) which is actually located in an entirely separate building (keycard access only - no separate reception area). This wing was completed mid-nineties and doesn't seem to have been refurbished since. The corridors are narrow and often had the distinct aroma of cannabis being smoked. I mention this because it shows you the class - or lack of - guest that stays here. The room had a wooden floor, and pleasantly high ceilings. The bathroom needed replacing and felt very dated. Once again there was nothing to make me feel like I was in a five star property. Even the \"easy\" things like shoehorns, clothes brushes, etc. weren't present. I cannot comment on the restaurants as I didn't try them. Reflet, the fine dining restaurant is around 60-80EUR per head which seems exceptionally steep for a dated menu. One of the puddings was described as \"canned cherry crumble\", I am curious as to when canned fruit became something of a delicacy. The Winter Garden is probably the only room which could belong to a five star property, a very small oasis. The hotel has its rating largely because of the superb (but bland) conference facilities. As long as this huge hotel can fill rooms at decent rates paid for by conferencees' companies and fill the rest with Priceline type guests I am sure they see no need to fix something that isn't broken. It is very hard to see - from a business perspective - how they could improve other than a complete refurbishment, which I don't think would make much economic sense. As an hotel it feels like it's just given up trying to be anything special and is instead happy to tick along nicely. The Royal Wing should've been turned into an \"hotel within an hotel\" with its own reception area and staff, giving it more of an \"executive/club floor\" feel, an half floor lounge with the usual food and drink presentations would've completed this. This would be a very small step in creating something five star in this property! As an aside, the concierge recommended restaurants that had been recommended to me by a friend who used to live in Amsterdam - so perhaps this small service aspect is close to a five star standard. Would I stay here again? One must look at the prices charged by five/four star properties in Amsterdam, none of them get close to 60GBP per night. In the interest of fairness I must add that I saw no instances of the vermin and other horror stories mentioned by other reviewers, however, it is a large property so I wouldn't be surprised! Only stay here if you are getting a very cheap deal otherwise you are guaranteed to be disappointed. Don't expect anything more special than a bland, very international feeling, distinctly average four star Hilton type property.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "County Durham, England", "Title": "\u201cSmart Hotel in Excellent Location\u201d", "Author": "Vicky2405", "ReviewID": "UR24952360", "Content": "We booked this hotel through Lastminute.com and got an excellent deal.

But that's basically it. First of all I have to say that we \"won\" this hotel with Priceline at around $160/night (not exactly cheap, considering we won much better hotels in Germany for less than half that price) This is important because it seems that they have very different room \"levels\". This is understandable and I'm aware that when I book with Priceline I might receive the worse rooms of the hotels I win. The problem is that this facility is officially a 5-star rating hotel, but the rooms they give to Priceline users are much worse than what you'd expect in a 3 star hotel. The first room they gave us was officially a non-smoking room, but it smelled like a cigar lounge. I complained and was given another room, just a few doors down. This time it did not smell, but -as the first one- it was simply ugly: small, dirty, rundown and with a horrible bathroom. Suffice it to say that it does not even have a real door, just a couple of saloon-like shutters. Not only it looked old and dirty, it was also one of the smallest bathrooms I've ever seen. When you check-in, be aware that if you are given a room in the back of the hotel, reachable through elevator #5, you are going to have a terrible experience. On the other hand, the public spaces of the hotel are very nice, although they too look pretty old, and would need a renovation. The Winter Garden where the breakfast buffet is prepared is very nice, although I'm not sure the buffet itself is worth the high price. If you don't want to spend that much, there are a few places that sell bread, croissants and rolls just a few meters from the hotel (especially on Damrak). Otherwise the department store that is just outside the hotel (on the right, looking at the Royal Palace) has a nice cafeteria. Also, if you arrive in Amsterdam by car, be prepared to spend an arm and a leg for parking: we parked at the Krasnapolsky's garage and we paid EUR 47.50 (~$75) per night!

I would recommend a stay at this hotel. Having been a regular visitor to Amsterdam over the last 10 years I finally got around to trying out the Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky. An easy going friendliness was instantly evident from the doorman, receptionist, luggage chap and waitresses. The whole staff provided a warm welcome and were highly efficient. No niggles at all. We were given an apartment rather than the standard room that I had booked. This was a short walk through the rear of the hotel, accompanied by the luggage chap. Might be a viewed as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdark alley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 if you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know Amsterdam too well. No problems during our stay but if you are a nervous traveller it might not be the right part of the hotel for you. Get someone to take your bags. A 5 Euro tip (per case) always gets a good response. We were on the 3rd floor in a corner apartment where Pjlsteeg meets the Oudezijds Voorburgwal. This is the edge of the Red Light District and it is busy into the small hours. There will be noise. The apartment was massive. Split over 2 floors. The lounge/Kitchen-diner on the first floors with windows over looking the canal and side street. A further set of steep, narrow stairs leads to the bathroom (Washer/Dryer) and the huge attic bedroom. Seemed like there were fresh towels, robes and toiletries for 10 people. No mini bar or coffee stuff but the kitchen had a fridge and everything else you might need. There is a shop below that sells basic supplies (open till about 7pm). The safe is in the bedroom (I never used this due to previous reviews about problems with cash being stolen). TV on both floors, stereo and VHS player. It definitely needs updating but it was reasonably clean. Housekeeping doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to come daily to the apartments. I think mainly because there are enough supplies to keep you going for the duration of your stay. This did not cause us any issues. Breakfast in the Winter Gardens was very nice indeed. Comparable in price (25 euro pp) and semi-self-serve format to most of the big Dutch hotels, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough to keep you going all day. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be shy to ask for more champagne if you find the ice bucket empty. The location opened up some parts of the city that I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been in years. I even ditched the usual taxi ride in from Schiphol in favour of a train ride and a short walk from Centraal. Pretty much hassle free but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to keep some coins handy (about 4 Euro one way) for the ticket machines at the airport/ train station (the machines at CS don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept visa cards for some reason \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only maestro). Dam is always busy and expect to battle the crowds at some point. You will feel like a tourist as this is the main drag for those visiting but the central location and easy transport options give you access to the whole of the city.

Check in was fast and the receptionist plucked room 2002 out of a hat and we headed to the lift. This room is I believe a standard which has windows facing onto the building(s) to the immediate right hand side of the hotel with an alley seperating them.

The only strange thing being that the toilet was seperate from the bathroom in a tiny room of it's own completely tiled in white, not good for the claustraphobics among us! The main blot on our stay was having some money stolen from our room safe...the room contained a safe with a digital lock which we used to stash our passports & money and travel documentation. I had been using it on a daily basis up until the Thursday evening which is when I discovered it unlocked with our valuables scattered around the inside and 100 Euros missing. Now, AFAIK I had locked it that morning (but of course it is possible I just thought I had and it was in fact left open!) either way money had been stolen. I in no way hold the hotel responsible but the reaction of the staff I reported really could not of been more indifferent (receptionist) or more sceptical (the hotel head of security). I got the distinct impression from the head of security that I was lying which made me almost as annoyed as having money stolen. I had to repeat myself over and over in an effort to convince him that we HAD had money stolen and in the end we were advised to claim on our insurance and that he would \"look into the matter\". No further communication from the hotel staff followed so this in my mind confirms the apathetic attitude I felt initially. Not wishing to have the theft of our money overshadow a well deserved break we decided to cut our losses (in fact we did visit the local police station TWICE in a effort to fill out a crime report but on both ocassions the two different officers could not find a copy of the relevant form in English...doh!)

To cut a long story short it took over an hour and half to try to sort this and they then ended up moving me to another room.

Check out wasnt as smooth as check in, not because the staff didnt know what they were doing, but because there were several people queued in front of us who were checking in, and asking a lot of questions.

I would rate the apartment 1 star and very hard to find any comfort in this apartment. On Arrival to the hotel I had booked and pre paid for a standard single room, I asked how much to upgrade to an apartment and they said it would be free, that was great. I knew that the stair case was going to be steep so the porter led me to the back of the hotel, down an alley and up the stair case which was like a ladder on a slight angle. The apartment on first view seemed large and I wanted privacy and got it too. I firstly un packed and put on some music but found out the stereo speakers had blown so had to turn it off. The apartment had lots of bits and pieces all arranged in a disorganised way so after a few hours I arranged it to the way I thought would be comfortable. The bedroom had 2 small single beds which are light and cheaply made they did not feel comfortable and I did not use them, the lounge had a pull out sofa bed similer to a futon and I used this bed but it was very hard to put together and everynight fell apart so I never had a good sleep. The kitchen had sufficient cutlery, crockery and cookware to cook basic foods and I cooked each night (suparmarket food in Amsterdam is incredibly cheap and I spend a total of 84 euros for 3 meals a day for 7 days). The fridge is very small so don't buy too much, the oven and hot plates worked well, microwave was fine and good lighting. The lounge has a TV, bookshelf, sofa bed, very large dinner table which takes up most of the space in the lounge, 2 chairs and 2 lounge chairs plus coffee table. It all looks like what you would see in an apartment of young guys who have just moved out of their parents house and have collected bits and pieces and hand me downs, nothing very comfortable or pleasant on the eye. The lounge also has a video player but my one did not work and no one could fix it, they also supply a file with the leaflets of all the appliances in the apartment but as so many of the appliances have been replaced over time the leaflets had not been replaced and are for appliances no longer in the apartment. The cupboard laundry has a washing machine and as savvy as I am with these kinds of appliances and with full instructions I struggled to use it as it i not your normal automatic front loader. After 3 nights in the apartment I started to get ill so I thought I need to give this place a good clean, I pulled the sofa away from the wall in the lounge only to find heaps of rotting food scraps and this is when I realised the apartment was dirty, I stayed ill for most of my time at the hotel. What did work superbly was the mini in room safe. The area around the hotel is awful, I saw so many drug addicts taking hard drugs in every corner of the hotels ally and area that connects the Royal Wing to the Main Hotel, every time I left my apartment to go out I was met with endless amounts of people asking me to buy drugs or promising me to help me find my way or offering info on Amsterdam, I was cleverly taken in by a few of these people as they seem so trustful only to find I was duped and again these are the people that are the drug users. If you are not use to this kind of environment you would just think they are friendly locals helping a tourist. I had breakfast in the hotel and it does cost 25euros but its really good, top quality foods well prepared. I enjoyed having a glass of bubbly in the morning before breakfast. The area that the hotel is located is the Red Light area and its very sleazy, loaded with drug addicts, husslers and all sorts of people hanging around the streets looking to make a quick buck. I spent the balance of my time in Leidersplane and found that the Park Hotel and the Marriot are well located in a more conservative healthy part of town. The stair case to the apartment always smelt of vomit and the apartment comes either cold or hot no in between.

The bathroom was honestly the tiniest I have ever experienced in a hotel. If you are offered this part of the hotel, see if you can change at check in. WI-FI in the room works fine but expensive at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17 from Swisscom. I didn't bother with breakfast as it's \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 for a continental and there are plenty of places nearby. The breakfast room is really beautiful though, so if you have the time to enjoy it, why not. There is a coffee bar at the front of the hotel, where you can get a coffee and pastry, but it is tired and soul-less that's why I guess it was empty at 8.30AM ! There are much better NH hotels in Amsterdam, such as the Barbizon Palace, worthy of the 5 stars they claim.

Read all of the reviews and was a little nervous since the reviews were either really good or really bad depending on the type of room you received so I just gritted my teeth and hoped for the best. Had read numerous reports about a busy front desk and not enough help. Yes, it was busy when we checked in on a Friday afternoon but we stood in line patiently as others jumped in front of us. I was a little tired from the flight and annoyed but really it only was about a 15 minute wait until our turn to check in. The people at the front desk were great. They gave us a message right away that we had waiting for us from a friend who lives there and even dialed his number for us right at the front desk so we could call right away. Our room was located in the Royal Wing and we loved it. Very spacious, new furniture, queen size bed, lots of closet space and a HUGE bathroom. We did have to go through a corridor outside using our keycard to get to our room but that didn't bother us. What did bother us was that sometimes it took a few swipes of the keycard to get into our wing. We noticed others having the same problem. No big deal though - we were going to get a new keycard but it seemed to be working better by the end of the week. They also gave us a coupon for 2 free welcome drinks in the bar. The bar also had great service and served a few light bites around happy hour. Included in our hotel package rate was the daily buffet breakfast. I'm not sure how much this costs normally but it was a great buffet. It was held in a beautiful room and had anything and everything you could want for breakfast for both American and European tastes. Also included was unlimited champagne that you just poured yourself - think we had champagne and/or mimosas at every breakfast. We used the concierge once to make a restaurant reservation for us. Turned out that the place we wanted to go to was closed for their vacation so he recommended a different one. It was a great recommendation (we told him what kind of place we were looking for ) - turned out to be our favorite restaurant for the entire trip! Right around the corner about a block away from the hotel is a little champagne/wine bar called Bubbles and Wine. This place had our names written all over it and we were frequent customers during our stay. Great service, great drinks, great appetizers! The location of our hotel was perfect. Had to take the train on a couple of days and it was an easy walk to the train station. Also an easy walk to almost anywhere!

They also provided all the essentials in travel size (toothbrush, toothpaste, comb, hairbrush, shaving kit, shampoo, shower gel etc etc) - you dont get all of these in most hotels.

Reccommendations are: Hire a bike!! This is my top tip. The first day we walked and our feet were killing by the end of it. Hiring a bike allowed us to visit all the sights at ease - and it was lots of fun too!! I reccommend the bike shop in between central staion and Dam sq (if you're at Dam sq and looking in central station direction then its on the right hand side). They charge 7euros per day whereas others we saw were 6 euros for 3 hours. We had the bikes for two days and it was only 13euros BARGIN Vondelpark - beautiful.

Goucho grill - we had spare ribs and steak - you get as many ribs as you can eat! Lovely food, nice setting! Leidseplein - buzzing atmosphere - good to dine alfresco or have a drink and people watch.

Nice people at reception, trying to help too many people with conflicting requests, with what appeared to be an antiquated registration system. Rooms not ready on time, requiring people to stand in line multiple times. This resulted in long lines and fraying tempers. This wasn't an issue for us, however the tension was papable. Summing up: To be very clear, many of the complaints, and problems we overheard appeared to be self-induced, with people attempting to extend reservations after checkout time; staying past checkout, resulting in delays; attempting to haggle rates, upgrades and prices at the counter; and large tour groups and meeting organizers hosted with their own issues.

I stayed in an executive room in the royal wing despite my suspicions after seeying all the varied reviews on different websites (should have been a warning already!!!). This leads me to the first and only advantage over other five stars in Amsterdam - it's location and the only reason I went forward with my reservation. Here's the horror in a nutshell. -incredibly slow reception. honestly, only two receptionists for a hotel this size. what are you thinking? you could see the build up anger/ frustrations of everyone waiting in 2 queues of minimum 5 people (and more during checkout times!!!) - non smoking room. nonetheless the room stank of smoke and there were cigarette burn marks in the curtains and night stands!!! - the exec room wasn't sound proof at all. I was woken up by someone elses wake up call. had to get up myself at 5 AM walk into the already vacant room and switch it off myself!!! To illustrate the noise levels even further I could hear other peoples conversations in the corridors word for word!!! - the exec room is thus far from the main hotel that any ''hot'' food from 24h room service is served cold. as was my experience with the bltc sandwich and margarita pizza! - the alley between the hotel and the royal wing is often visited by drugdealers and or youths smoking drugs. o.k. it's Amsterdam but single females, older people could feel threatened. - prostitutes tend to visit this hotel. coming back one night and going up in the elevator a ''lady of the night'' offered me her services! could not believe it!!! after declining kindly she asked me whether I could buzz her out since the door is key activated. obviously she did not have one!!! - it's design has been radically changed the last 4/5 years. the winter garden is beautiful but the rest of the hotel lacks in design and luxury. Most certainly not the interioir one would expect from a five star hotel! It has been downgraded to an unoriginal and plain ''modern'' design which is a shame considering the hotel history. - the standard rooms are quite cheap but attract all kinds of riff raff. definately not the kind of people one would expect in a luxury hotel. please don't get me wrong im really open minded but this is simply an observation. - the products offered in the bath room were very cheap and horrible. really I do not want to use shampoo that leaves me smelling like an orange or a yelly bean!!! - frankly you cannot charge 254 euros nighly for the exec room and have all the above happening to you. All in all. Please take my advise and stay away from this hotel. I'm a Dutch citizen living in London and a fond lover of hotels. I most definately do not hold a grudge although I should after experiencing the above!!!

The bad points of the hotel are that even on the fourth floor, noise from Dam square could clearly be heard in our room at about 6.00 am. Also, on our first night we lost electricity in our room after switching on the kettle. This ties in what others have said about the hotel needing refurbishment. But on the plus side, the kettle was replaced quickly and without fuss. I agree with what others have said in that this is not a five star hotel. In order to achieve this status, the hotel needs to add extra value. These would be perhaps bathrobes, branded toiletries and free shuttlebus to the airport. At the moment this is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12 per person. Overall Jess and I enjoyed our stay here because thanks to the reviews here we knew what to expect.

We returned later in the day tofind our room smelled of tobacco smoke. We opened the windows and it seemed to clear. We had read on this board that the heating could only be left on by placing the room key card in a slot in the room. However, we found this not to be the case. There was plenty of dangerously hot water and fantastic water pressure. Later that night we returned to the hotel bar, which was extremely busy and had a good atmosphere. Unfortunatley we couldn't stay there as just about all of the guests were smoking and the bar was so full of smoke that visibility was poor!!. I can only think that this chain smoking is a continental thing as in England you have to check that smoking is permitted and in which areas. In every bar and restaurant in Amsterdam, everybody smokes. The hotel reception staff were unsympathetic when told that even though we were on a non smoking floor, everyone was smoking. As soon as you walked into the hotel you could smell smoke and probably smoked five of those cigarettes and/or cigars before getting to the lift. In every day situations at home we come across smokers in bars and restuarants and cafes and it is never a problem. In Amsterdam it was totally intolerable. On the plus side the hotel is very well situated and all major aeas of interest are easily accessible from there. The rooms are comfortable and clean. However, we expect better facilities and levels of service in a 5 star hotel. The hotel looks jaded and in need of an overhaul. It looks as though it hasn't been upgraded at all in the seven years since we last stayed there. We found that the bar prices were almost double to the same drinks served in bars outside. We also had to pay again forour room on departure as they claimed not to have been paid by the tour company despite showing them our receipts stating payment made some 9 weeks earlier.

Since we enjoyed the location, the extra space vs. hotel room space and the ability to sleep in w/o maid service constantly knocking on your door, I will just highlight a few drawbacks. First, there was not any oven. We had no intention on \"cooking\", but we are fond of take-out from our favorite restaurants and sometimes the microwave \"re-heating\" just doesn't cut it. Not a big deal by any stretch of the imagination. Second, there a A LOT of stairs. Not only in the apartment (which I tried to photograph) but also to get up to the second floor was quite tricky with our luggage. The stairs are narrow, very steep and whindy (sp?). We utilized their bellhop, but it was a chore regardless. Again, not a deal breaker, just something to consider if climbing up 2-3 flights of stairs and down every day is not \"your thing\".

This is an event which happens every five years where the tall ships complete a major crossing from Boston. Amsterdam, a city with a population of only 750k gets 2.4 million visitors during this event. In 2000 I visited for a day and promised myself that the next time it was on I would stay in Amsterdam and fully take in the event. I originally booked a three night weekend stay at the three star Boatel. This I switched to the Krasnapolski when i saw on bookings that I could get a superior room at this five star hotel for the same price. We arrived shortly before 11am and were told, not surprisingly, that our rooms were not yet ready. They did say however that they had been vacated and that they would call up to housekeeping to get them cleaned. True enough, an hour later we were able to check in. The only criticism I would have of the reception process is that when we returned to collect our keys the queue at reception was long. There did not seem to be the necessary extra staff or reception points to cope, it thus took us some twenty minutes before we were seen to. The reception area itself is modern and perhaps not as ornate or interesting as one would expect of a hotel in this class. Our rooms were situated in the 'Royal Wing' of the hotel. This is an annexe which you reach across a short covered alleyway to the side of the hotel. To access this you had to use your keycard, that aside it is very much a part of the hotel. The rooms are spacious, with wooden floors and modern prints on the walls. As you would expect from such an establishment they are equipped with every imaginable amenity, in room safe, mini bar, tea and coffee making facility, Towel bath robes, slippers, etc. There are comfortable seats and adequate working area. The marble bathroom had a good size bath with an excellent combi shower. The towels were plentiful and thick, there was a hair dryer, separate makeup/shaving mirror and a comprehensive array of toiletries. As we were looking out onto the street our window arched out over it giving the impression of an internal balcony. The downside of this is that the one night we tried to sleep with the aircon off and the window open the street noise was intrusive. Both rooms we had were spotless and maintained to a very high standard. Breakfast is held in a very ornate room, The Winter Garden. At 22 euros it is expensive but if you have the time and the inclination it is worth going for. Perhaps the widest buffet I have ever seen, covering all tastes, is on offer. This is complimented by champagne for those who feel up for it. One word of caution, breakfast finishes at 10.30 and this does mean that it is finished, the buffets are mostly empty by then and will not be refilled. My best advice to anyone considering this option is to get there by at least 10am if you want to fully enjoy it. During our stay we did not try the hotel's restaurant. This is in a cosy, panneled, attractive looking room. The menu itself didn't appeal to me but this may be doing the hotel a disservice. I visited the bar a couple of times. It is in modern Dutch design. The service and choice of drinks was good but otherwise it was unremarkable. Throughout our stay the staff were efficient and friendly despite being somewhat under pressure on this busiest of Amsterdam weekends. There is arguably no greater location for a hotel in Amsterdam than that which the Krasnapolski occupies. It is on the principal square in the city, Dam. This is about ten minutes walk, in a straight line, from Central Station. As a base for exploring the city, be that on foot, by bike or by public transport there is none better. We paid 130 euro (plus 6 city tax) a night for our rooms. At this rate the hotel can only be described as excellent value and well worth the stay. On the Saturday night of our stay a colleague who had booked somewhat later was in a standard double room at the rate of 200 euro plus tax. That is probably about the right rate for such a room in such a hotel. The rack rate of 350 euros per night is certainly too much.

Although they did try their best to have our room ready sooner, it simply wasn't possible with so many people checking in that busy Saturday. I had so wished I had not listened to my travel agent and booked an extra day- it would have been well worth it for us, just something to consider if your flight schedule was similar to ours! The Japanese restaurant in the hotel did not disappoint, food was great. A bit on the pricey side, but not a great shock to us New-Yorkers. The Winter Garden is beautiful.

Queen's Day was held on April 30 and my room overlooked the stage they set up for their Queen's entertainment. I would recommend visiting Amsterdam during this local holiday, one of the coolest events I have ever attended. The hotel staff was great also. I recommend taking the airport shuttle for 11 Euros, convenient and worth it. Great location for hotel, in the middle of everything. Lots of great restaurants and bars close by. I recommend Gaucho for steaks, also the NY Pizza stand and falafal sandwaches are filling and cheap. I also recommend the scrumptious pastry shop next door. Avoid the EuropaBar next to hotel, 5 Euros is too expensive for a beer. Amstedam is a great city to visit and the dutch residents are very nice. London is getting too expensive, I think Amstedam will service as my base for my Europe travels now because although hotels expensive, everything else is fairly reasonable.", "Date": "May 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "belgium", "Title": "\u201cLocation... not a palace but excellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "stevenBrussels", "ReviewID": "UR3461815", "Content": "I booke dthe hotel at the NH Hotel site at an attractive rate.

The \"Junior\" size we were given was 1 bedroom, a separate living room/kitchen and a view overlooking a pleasant, quiet courtyard. We had plenty of space to stretch out, 2 tv's (we don't watch, but I mention it for those of you who do), good interior lighting, comfy furniture, and we saved a bundle preparing our own breakfast and a few other meals, which helped with the Euro/dollar conversion. There's a supermarket and plenty of other shopping close by. The hotel concierge is very helpful, plus you can buy a multi-use tram ticket (strippenkart) in the hotel's Business Room. Amsterdam is so compact, in good weather you can walk (or rent a bike) to most museums, etc. The minuses: check-in wasn't until after 3 (absolutely no relief for the jetlagged), the apartment entrance was through the hotel's kitchen area, those narrow, steep Dutch steps, the mattresses were soft (although we slept fine), and we couldn't get the smell of cigarette smoke out of the room.

I stumbled across the apartments by accident and, after checking trip advisor, decided to get them a try. I couldn' have been more pleased. Information is hard to find, without any real link from the hotel site itself, but a check on search engines turned up several locations for booking, including a well hidden page on the hotel's main site. I'm not quite sure what the story is. The hotel is large and complex - the sort of place that needs to specify \"for your room use elevator six, which is around five corners and down a long hallway....\". It occupies the majority of a square block, and includes several small buildings that I suspect are listed. It is these buildings that contain the apartments. In many cases they are in mixed buildings, some apartments seem to be either not owned by the hotel or on long-term leases, while others are available for rent. The ground floor may very well contain a shop. The hotel site indicates that the minimum booking period is one week, but I was able to secure a four-day booking from one of the online sites. Other reviewers have accurately described the process, you check in at the hotel, etc. Our particular apartment, one of several with this characteristic, was accessed through the hotel kitchen. Sort of strange, but we got used to it. Problems first: the entrance through the kitchen. the fact that our outside door was never locked, not once, in the four days we stayed there. Granted you had to walk through the hotel lobby to get there, but still.... the hole in the wall at the bottom of the steps where someone probably lost control of their suitcase (along with drywall debris that wasn't swept up the entire time we were there. The upside: EU119 for a two room apartment with a loft. The unit was squeeky clean. We had all the normal hotel supplies, soap, towels, etc. We had a kitchen with microwave, fridge, pots and pans, corkscrew, etc. The living room was huge and we felt like we were at home. Although there were other units on our hallway, the only thing we ever heard was faint TV noises as we walked past the units. Once inside our unit, nothing. The furnishings are indeed a bit like HoJo's, but they were fine. The living room had a big leather couch with matching chair, coffee table, several lamps, a dining table with four chairs, fully equipped kitchen. More than I had possibly hoped for.

The main problem with this hotel is service overall and the front desk in particular. First, the lobby of the Krasnapolsky is extremely disorganized. There is no reason that they could not put up a sign and some ropes indicating that the line for the check-in counter starts \"here\". Instead, guests were coming at the clerks from all directions and people breaking into the 2 or 3 lines that had formed. It made the check-in process about twice as long as it should have been. Second, there were only three front desk clerks working when we checked in and there were many guests lined up. This is poor planning and again contributed to a very long and very frustrating check in. On to my room. It was clean, yet very small and cramped. I would have expected more for 200 Euro a night. Also, I had to walk a great distance to get to the elevator, and there were a minimum of signs. Again, very frustrating. The room safe malfunctioned and I could not get access to my valuables. Again, frustrating. On the positive side, the breakfast was excellent. Very good food and good service in the restaurant. At checkout, the same chaotic scene greeted me, and a stranger in front of me commented that the front desk area was possibly the most disorganized he had ever seen. I agree with him. The front desk in any hotel is vital to a customer's impression of the hotel - and the front desk at the Krasnapolsky is about the worst I have ever encountered - especially for a \"luxury\" hotel. I would not stay at the Krasnapolsky again. Ironically, I stayed at the NH Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau Marquette in Heemskerk for 5 nights prior to the Krasnapolsky, and although the hotel was not as luxurious as the Krasnapolsky, the staff were friendly and helpful and the food was again very good.

If you want a lot of quiet though, it can be a noisy area at night", "Date": "September 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "nice", "Title": "\u201cwonderful\u201d", "Author": "hannah23", "ReviewID": "UR2497188", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed there for 5 nights for the New Year... and loved every second of it.

We stayed at this hotel on our last night as we had a flight out of Amsterdam and it's convenient to the train station. We had 2 rooms in the Royal wing, which were OK, but definitely not worth the money we paid compared to other hotels on our trip in the same price range. Hotel Krasnapolsky seems to cut corners to give guests the appearance of luxury without actually having to pay for it. The rooms are attractive, with hardwood floors and modern furnishings. But they skimp on the big ticket items. Other hotels in this price range have very fine linens and down comforters. This one had heavier synthetic comforters and less expensive bedding. There are robes and slippers and abundant little goodies in the bathroom, but the flourescent lighting in the bathroom was dim and depressing. The decor was bargain-basement trying to look expensive -- faux granite on the bathroom floor and no evidence of design or artfulness anyplace in the hotel. I knew it was an old hotel and expected to find at least a hint of its former elegance. I didn't. I'm glad we didn't pay the 21 euros apiece for breakfast in the Winter Garden. (there's a very nice cafe next door with a huge breakfast for less than half that.) I suppose what you are paying for is the Hotel's Dam Square location, but considering how easy it is to get around in Amsterdam, and considering how noisy and dirty the Dam is, why not stay some place a little further away and just walk over? As to convenience to the train station, it's about a 3-4 block walk which is fine for someone who isn't traveling with kids but we ended up taking a taxi to the airport anyway!", "Date": "August 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cWatch our for those rooms....\u201d", "Author": "Bobster2006", "ReviewID": "UR2458626", "Content": "Just returned from a 3 night stop at this hotel so here's my thoughts. I have to say that if you do not get a room upgrade, your thoughts on this hotel will be very different. The 1st room we were put in would be expected of a 3 star hotel. The toilet was miniscule, the bathroom not far behind (so small, it had to have swinging saloon doors), the room itself quite small. It does seem that all 'best internet rates' will be placed in these rooms. We were offered an upgrade at 35 Euros a night which we refused (they stated that they had no other rooms available). After 15 minutes they managed to give us a different room (obviously kept for someone who has not paid the 'best internet rate'). This room was bigger, nicer bathroom & toilet, although the shower leaked. Apart from the wide variation in rooms, everything else checked out great - location, food, comfort. No swimming pool though - I would have expected this for a 5 star hotel. I would not go back though, I know that I can get better for 180 Euros per night.", "Date": "August 18, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great bed!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2330581", "Content": "Just returned from our 3 night break at this great hotel.

The rooms are small but clean and tastefully decorated. The bathroom is small as well but very nicely done and very user friendly. We opted for a \"quiet\" room and thus did not have a view of Dam Square but I really didn't care at that point. Just some nice peaceful sleep was what we needed before coming home. Having said all that though the staff is not too friendly. Although the doorman and concierge were nice, the people behind the front desk were rude and not very helpful. I went online during our stay and noticed that they were offering the same room we were staying in for 40 Euro less per night. When I asked them to change my rate they said it was impossible. When I told them to cancel my remaining reservation and we would lodge elsewhere, they changed my rate.
