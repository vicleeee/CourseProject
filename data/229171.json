If you want state of the art, look elsewhere, but the tab will likely be much higher without much more comfort. The furnishings and decor are definitely from another era, but that works in many charming ways at NH Doelen. The updated bathroom looked recently remodeled. The staff was excellent and accomodating at all hours. If you have a couple days to get familiar with the area's winding canal streets you'll find relatively easy walking distance to anywhere around central Amsterdam, and interesting streets any direction. Almost next door to opera house. Small TV but many, multi-language channels 3 or 4 which are English 24 hours, including CNN and BBC. It was approximately -6 centigrade, and the heaters were pretty outdated, so that could be a problem for someone with specific temperature concerns. You could hear some rowdy folks down on the street from our windows, but if somebody's got a problem with people partying, they might want to rethink the destination. Besides the obvious tourist distractions, Amsterdam has an interesting past that still serves as a foundation for the current bohemian beehive, and NH Doelen still felt like a vibrant part of the scene. With age has come a funky cool. There is a small historical marker indicating that this is where Rembrandt painted The Night Watch. The under renovation Rijksmuseum Museum still has lines around the block, with that masterpiece as the central attraction. The exhibit's basic guide listings serve as a pretty comprehensive guide to Amsterdam's history and you'll get feel for tradition, not tourism. If you stop at a decent coffee shop, the line for the museum ( 3/4 to one hour) isn't bad at all. NH Doelen is relatively close to most major venues, around a 15 minute walk to Paradiso, Hard Rock/comedy club area, and crowded restaurant and smokeshop squares. Numerous public transportation points near hotel, but this is a unique place to walk, despite often uneven cobblestones on narrow streets you will probably have to dodge a few bikes on. Well worth it, and in terms of people watching alone NH Doelen has some great views both on property and nearby. Anyone visiting Amsterdam by car for the first time should definitely make verifiable advance parking plans (don't count on suburb park and ride stations) or be prepared to pay approximately 50 euro per 24 hour parking almost anywhere within reasonable walking distance of noteworthy areas. And good luck without a GPS, many of which seem to become intoxicated by construction and narrow one way half streets anyway. NH Doelen had excellent valet service at 45$ a day, well worth it considering the street area immediately in front of NH Doelen will probably be a construction zone for a while and thus a real pain to drive. The dog acted normal/happy, room came with small bed/basket and fetch toy that was used often. This was a very good stay at a well run hotel, an assessment agreed by all parties in a three room/floor group.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Maine", "Title": "\u201cA sparkling canal-side gem near the heart of a vibrant city\u201d", "Author": "mainemountainbear", "ReviewID": "UR89506752", "Content": "Front desk service was generally excellent throughout our stay, including taking special care to arrange reliable taxis for guests.

I arrived at the hotel around 9am after an overnight flight, and was not able to check into my room - but I have found that this occurs more often than not travelling in Europe. I was able to leave my bags at the hotel and was requested to come back after 12:00pm. Bag check is semi-secure, they are stored behind the check-in desk, but still out in the open, so I would take anything important with me. As for the location, it was easy walking distant to popular attractions; a little over a mile to Anne-Frank Haus and Rijk/Van Gogh Musuem in the opposite dircection. Also, easliy accesbile to Daam Square. Depending on the amount of luggage it is also not a terrible walk from Centraal Station, less than a mile, (1.2 km). After sight seeing in the morning I was getting tired and went back to the hotel around 1:30pm. My room was ready and I as able to take a nap. My room was clean, although outdated. Bathroom was also clean, I felt comfortable taking a bath and shower. I could not figure out the TV but I did not plan to watch any television anyway. During the afternoon, the room was quiet enough for a nap, but the street noise was very loud on saturday evening, even with the windows closed. I needed to use earplugs to blockout the revelry at the bars below. I feel that in this case the location is a positive and a negative. There are a lot of bars/pubs and retaurants across the canal from the hotel, which is useful if you are looking to just stumble back to the hotel, but can be annoying if you are trying to sleep - the noise from the bars bouces off the buldings and the canals back towards the hotel. I paid 160EU (~$220), and this may have been a bit much for an outdated hotel, but it was comperable to other hotels near attractions I wanted to visit. I did not eat breakfast at the hotel.

Its only a 5 minute taxi ride from central station and close to the tram lines. Check in went well but didnt tell us when breakfast would be served and where as we were staying room only. I found one of the those order forms from room service breakfast and nealy had a fit when I saw the price. 19 euro's pp plus a 4 euro tray charge for full breakfast delievered to your room. Its worth the short walk to the local bakery and get breakfast. I made the booking for the room with last minute.com and paid \u00c2\u00a3212 for 3 nights on room only basis. I booked i through one of thier top secret hotel deals. But was dissapointed when I read some of the reviews. I wouldnt trust all of them. I would defently stay at this hotel if I could get the right deal again. Lovely looking hotel and very 5* looking in the reception area. You have to pay 30 euros extra for a canal view room which also includes a mini bar. I wasnt willing to pay that much extra. We were allocated room 204 which was on the canal side of the hotel!! So I was happy about that. The rooms on the same side as ours, the next one down had balconys which looked lovely. So if its a special occasion I think its worth the money for the upgrade. The room was off a good size, very comfy double bed. Large wardrobe with plenty of hanging space and trouser press. There was also a safe within the wardrobe for special items, didnt bother with that and hoped the staff were trustworthy!! Which they were thank god.The bathroom had a bath with a shower over it. The ONLY problem I had during our stay was with the plug in the bath. The chain was attached to the plug hole so wouldnt let you twist the plug down into the hole. Went to reception and reported the problem. 5 minutes later I had maintenance at the door who I though had fixed the problem. When he left I started to run a bath but the plug would still not sit in the hole with a tight lock. So couldnt have a proper bath without keeping the water running. Great for temperature but not eco friendly!! That problem would seem trivial to some people but when you pay for a service, it should work!! But I couldnt be bothered to change rooms just in case we had a non canal view room. Another bonus for the fussy pillow types- they have a pillow menu!!! 5 different types of pillows to choosed from for every type you could need. I thought that was a nice touch as I always miss my pillows from home. The hotel location was perfect and was about 5 minute walk to Dam sqaure, the dungeons and 10 mins to Madame Tussuards. I would recommend booking most trips in advance. I paid 18.50 for the dungeons.But if you go on the tussards website you can get a better deal. The red light district and Anne Frank house were 10 minute walk away which is good for when you are sight seeing. Most resturants locally do some great deals on food also. 11 euros for steak, chips and salad which is a bargain. Overall I would most defently visit this hotel.

It is not a bad place, there are just so many better for better value. You will leave feeling slightly ripped off, and in my opinion you will be slightly ripped off. You know when you buy a pair of shoes on sale for 60 euro, and the salesman says you've made a bargain because full price at his store is 80. You feel ok. And the next day you pass a shop that sells the exact same shoes at full price for 50 - and in your favourite color. You know the feeling? That is what staying at Hotel Doelen feels like. It is rated as a four-star, and was in no way as good as the three-star we left in Germany. The paint coming off just next to the cobweb (!) at the entrance was tell-tale, and should have warned of things like the shower just barely making a trickle of water. Hotel-advise for Amsterdam: Get your room as high as possible from the street noise. The bars are best in the next street. Avoid tram-lines close to your room, they are effective transport but the noise and shaking of buildings makes them better to go in the next street. Stay out of most central city-area, where there will be parties, small rooms and big bills. It is so incredibly easy and nice to stroll a couple of thousand metres away from the bar scene when you've had enough but the others want to keep going. We got a decent, newly furnished room at Doelen and paid an additional 30 euro a night for canal-view. We were not so much interested in the view, as we wanted to avoid the insane noise from the street. True - the noise in Niueew Doelenstraat is not the worst. The room was dusty, and there were curly hairs in various colors on the woolen badspread. We tossed the bedspread on the big cupboard. The room in it self was not bad exept for the before-mentioned barely leaking shower. Apparently - we were lucky still. One night we came to the hotel, it was impossible to get service in the desk because the only staff working was busy with a client that said he had been charged to much on his credit card. Apparently that was not his only complaint. Last thing I heard him say before the slow elevator closed us in, was \"nothing works in my room! The shower, the telephone...\" Shortly we also had a credit-card experience. We planned for a bill at around 400 euros. The hotel reserved 480 euros on my account from day one, and said nothing. That means you can't use those money, no matter if your plan is to pay by cash or travellers cheques at the point of leaving. I understand the hotel need security, but they should have told us in stead of just locking it on my account. Service at the hotel varied greatly. The daytime staff was great. The nighttime staff nice but weird and not so professional. One did not know the services the hotel boasts of in the wlecome brochure, and snapped at me on the phone. Another sent me way downtown for a snack when there were plenty possiblilites 100 meters away in the other direction. He simply did not know he area around the hotel.

We booked through Travel Republic and got a really good deal including breakfast which worked out a lot cheaper than all the other websites I checked (\u00c2\u00a3240 total). I had requested a room with canal view if possible and was extremely surprised that we got one (see photo) considering the hotel was fully booked and such a room cost 30 Euros a night upgrade. When we arrived the receptionist was friendly and took our bags as the room wasn't available. Later when we got into the room, I checked the bedsheets and found some spots of blood on one of the sheets. I phoned down to reception to get them changed, shortly after a man came in and wanted to check the sheets first. I pointed out the stains and he disputed it was blood and laughed. I said it was and I wanted the sheets changed, reluctantly he took the sheet off and to our horror the mattress protector under the sheet was covered in a large red stain and large brown stain and other smaller stains. I actually felt sick at the sight of it! I said that he could take that sheet away too, and he replied he couldn't take it off! He was totally non-plussed about it! I insisted and so he did remove it (muttering in his language under his breath) and put back a plain sheet on the bed. No apology - just made me feel like a real inconvenience. The room itself had seen better days, the wooden furniture was chipped, the chair and bottom of the bed grubby and stained, the wallpaper was peeling off the walls and the bathroom had some cracked tiles and smelt strongly of urine whenever you took a shower. Breakfast was excellent and we managed to get a table looking out onto the canal each morning which was lovely. When we checked out the receptionist asked how our stay had been and I mentioned about the sheets to which he replied sorry to hear that but it was clear he was just asking becuase he had to and didn't mean the aplogy. Also when we checked in he had said that he needed a credit card for the room but as we only had a debit card he said he would have to take 50 Euros and would give us this back in cash when we checked out. He asked whether there was anything else he could do and I asked for the 50 Euros (clearly he had forgotten about it, he had to go and check with a colleague but I'm sure if I hadn't have asked we would have lost out on our 50 Euros!)

I had read the previous reviews but wanted to give it a try. First impressions on entering the reception area was wow, this looks lovely and looked very elegant. They had obviously spent money on the reception area and this made us look forward to seeing our rooms (there were four of us). Upon entering the room (twin 3rd Floor) we thought it was bright but the decor was very tired and could do with painting/touching up. I understand that they may want to keep the hotel's original features as it is definately not a modern hotel as the furniture looked tatty/cheap and I'm sure it would benefit from even better quality reproduction furniture. The bathroom didnt seem to match the room and we had a shower over the bath with no shower curtain, so of course water went everywhere. We mentioned this to reception did send someone up who told us that some bathrooms were not meant to have a shower curtain (which we thought was odd as there was a shower, so why no curtain?). We ended up using towels on the floor to mop up the water. I had read in previous reviews that some guests experienced noise and we did too at night time (our room was overlooking the canal) but I guess you can't control noise from the outside. On the last night there was also a sound like a loud humming noise but we couldn't quite work out where it was coming from. Whoever was meant to service our room during our stay on the 3rd floor didnt replace/fill any of the toiletries so we at one point had no hand soap and ran out of toilet roll. We also had to ask for more tea/milk as this wasnt restocked either. Having to ask repeatedly for things to be restocked/replaced for a four star hotel isnt acceptable. I think management should at least ensure that when things are running low in guest rooms they are replaced so guests dont have to keep asking for things - it just makes for a more relaxing stay. Upon returning to our room one day we saw one of the housekeeping ladies sat on the end of a bed in another room at the end of the corridor (the door was open) and as soon as she saw us she jumped up. This just made us wonder if they actually did any cleaning to our rooms at all whilst we are out. The other 2 in our party had a twin room on the 5th floor which was very small and warm (a fan was already provided).

Breakfast was exceptional with everything you could want from cereals, yoghurt, fruit, cooked, continental etc and there was even champagne and classical music playing in the elegant dining room while you ate! It is situated about an hours drive from the airport but the easiest thing to do is to head to the train station at the airport and head straight to the city centre and its about a 15 minute walk to the hotel or you can simply hop in a cab or on a tram and it will drop you right outside! Amsterdam is a fab city and everything is best explored on foot with the red light district, city centre and Ann Franks house all with easy walking distance. The arts quarter is about a 15/20 minute walk away however but its a lovely stroll so we didn't mind!
