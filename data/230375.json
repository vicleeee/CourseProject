{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Large spacious lounge Hotel rooms were small and they were not full at all, but we were given a room far away at the back. Breatfast was E 15 each day - very expensive and food was not covered and small flies were hovering all over: when this was pointed out, restaurant manager just covered it instead of removing it all together. We found the service terrible: the hotel staff did not have any information about tours or tour times: we were told no tours were available on holidays and we found out that was not true. Staff also told us to use the outside path to get to our rooms with our bags on a cold and rainy day: there was an indoor path which they did not mention at all!! Staff was couteous but just had no clue about their own services and did not seem to notice or care what guests needed.House keeping was also not very good at cleaning our rooms: garbage bins were not cleared and our beds were not made most mornings. This was an old abbatoir (slaughter house) and frankly, we found the atmosphere very strange - rooms and main building are separated and spread out: very inconvenient for the elderly. We booked this hotel through United Airlines.", "Date": "Sep 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR673742815", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "LanThwar"}, {"Content": "Friendly hotel for tired tourists, loved the service. The first night in a foreign country for an inexperienced traveller is just plain scary. Took us quite a while to figure out where to pick up our baggage at Frankfurt Airport after a 12 hour daytime flight from Cape Town. Adventurous we had to be, so the inviting taxi was ignored and we took the famous German trains. All the ticketing officers where courteous, spoke English and we were soon on our way.Reception was gracious and we were soon settled in a large room with space for all the baggage and plenty to spare. They even kept the restaurant open for us and we experience our first proper German meal, with beer for only \u9227?9. A wonderfull experience as we were the only people in the restaurant and never felt hurried.The next morning, checkout only at 12, which allows you some time to sleep of the adrenaline of the flight, we checked our baggage into storage for free and spend the day exploring Offenbach and stocking up on supply's for our Motorhome.I can honestly reccommend this hotel for all RV renters in Frankfurt, Good food, reasonably priced, friendly staff, able to converse fluently in English and an imaginative setting", "Date": "May 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR464543146", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Erich7"}, {"Content": "Unique Hotel       Tub and Shower", "Date": "Apr 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR124580722", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "turner1988"}, {"Content": "Excellent Business Class Hotel, 20 mins outside city centre though. Stayed here for 3 nights, including New Years Eve in Frankfurt. Hotel is very good standard, very suited to business travellers but it is roughly 20 mins drive from the centre of Frankfurt. We did not realise this when booking! There were 5 of us staying at this hotel so a taxi into the city centre worked out roughly \u62e23 each so not too bad.Hotel is very nice looking, it may have possibly been a train terminal or something as it has interesting architecture. Rooms spacoius modern furnishings. A double room was 2 beds pushed together and we each had a duvet-i didnt mind this at all!!Hotel has a sauna, beware naked people!! Us brits went in with swim suits on, the gremans in true style did not. We each laughed at each other for very different reasons!We did not have breakfast here as it was roughly \u62e212 and we choe to go into the city center where there are fantastic restaurants coffee shops and bars. Vapiano restaurant and Pizza Factory highly recommended! The hotel also has a bar/restaurant next door which was very busy on a saturday night and did brilliant cocktails.We went to Frankfurt to see a friend and a change of scene to celebrate New Year. All we did for 4 days was eat drink walk around and laugh a lot!", "Date": "Feb 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR471644706", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "shangri-lada"}, {"Content": "Good hotel near the airport I stayed in ACHAT plaza hotel with a friend in august.

I loved how modern the hotel is; the bathroom was definitely the most high-tech one I've ever seen. The room was spacious and very clean, as well as soundproof. The look of the room is very appealing too, as clean lines run throughout and sleekness is everywhere you look. The staff, too, was very helpful with information about how to get around to Frankfurt and were always pleasant. As part of the tour, I was able to eat breakfast and dinner at the hotel - and both meals were delicious. The only problem I had with the hotel was how far it was from the city - however, with the help of a cab ride, it is very manageable (it takes around 20-30 minutes to walk to the city centre).

What a Cool Place !!! So ultra modern..... rooms are VERY confortable and super clean. Loved the decor and bathrooms. This was a great little find. Staff very friendly and helpful.

(No Airplanes noise either).Great sound proofing. My brother wants to design his house like the rooms. The bathroom is 5 stars for sure. (Great area too).The building is superb and I will for sure be back. It is worth the 20 min stroll from the station .... or cab ....(I also took a cab which was 5 Euros). It is worth staying a little further out .... prices are alot cheaper and all you need to do it take a cab for 5 Euros (or walk 20 mins). You get way better value.
