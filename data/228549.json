The hotel is located extremely conveniently, right opposite the Castilla Plaza Metro Station and the bus stop. Very close by, are a McDonald's cafe and a BurgerKing outlet. So location-wise cannot beat this hotel. My room was tiny, probably coz it was single sharing. I almost climbed up on the bed to put on my pajamas once. Having said that, the house-keeping kept the rooms extremely neat and tidy. Very well stocked mini bar and all necessary trivialities available in the washroom - showercap, dental kit, comb etc etc. A surprise, and a delight for a European hotel. Breakfast was okay - probably good for non-veggies. Couldn't find much on the vegetarian ensemble though. The staff in the day during check-in was extremely polite with a decent sense of humor, much required when you check-in post a 14 hr flight. However most of the front desk execs in the evening/night didn't seem to like their jobs, or their guests much. Although English is about as common in Spain as an action role portrayed by Martin Sheen, the staff here spoke passable English, and pretty much understood all I had to say. One of the girls at the desk, even managed an El Classico, Real Madrid vs Barcelona match ticket for me. The lifts at the hotel are amongst the slowest in Madrid, probably in all of Spain. And they charge a monstrous fee for parking, I couldn't help but notice. Overall, couldn't complain much about the stay here for convenience vs the price I paid. Good value for money for sure.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot that great\u201d", "Author": "Bruno_trips", "ReviewID": "UR121227045", "Content": "Well, the staff, except for the breakfast ladies, is terrible.

Arrived at the hotel at 11:30 and I was told there were no rooms available till noon, and that is totally fine and standard procedure all around. I go out for a walk and 12:45 I come back to the hotel and ask the front desk clerk \"Is my room ready?\". He replies: \"No\", turns around and hands over the situation to someone else. No biggie, it happens... The other front desk guy checks me in and I go to my room. I turn on the A/C and, almost immediately, water comes down from the ceiling. I turn off the A/C and go to sleep. 3 days later they didn't even bother to give me another bar of soap, shun me because I went out for a smoke late at night and charge me 28 euros for 3 days worth of terrible internet. The pricey internet, A/C problems and soap issues I can live with, it happens everywhere. But the rudeness of the staff is simply unacceptable.

Also the lifts are not quick and they dont have many. So ensure you dont get a room on the higher floors. I got a room on the 4th floor and was able to walk down when needed. The air-conditioner was leaking and I had to pack a very wet suitcase one friday when leaving for London. The staff we as helpful when I complained. But please check.

The only issue with my room is with the air conditioning that sometimes was not working perfectly. Be aware that sometimes the cleaning ladies can enter quite early in the morning in the room. But it happened only once. The check-out was done easily also, and the staff was very nice. The hotel is not in the center but you can reach in approx 20 min in the center by metro. It is convenient that you can go in any direction of the city, by having the metro and the bus in front of the hotel.

The Abba Casilla Plaza is located in the business sector not to far from the British Embassy. Its a clean, comfortable hotel but not the cheapest. I found the staff helpful and friendly. The rooms are very clean, comfortably and have all amenities you would expect , bath, shower, hair dryer, ironing press, bidet, safe, comfortable beds and I must say soundproof as well. Towels were replaced everyday and the room cleaned. There is a fridge in the room full of goodies[drinks, chocolate] but be warned they charge an arm and a leg for anything you drink or eat. The hotel restaurant is very expensive and personally do not think the meals are worth the cost. We ate in on the first night only, after that we ate out as you can get 2 meals out for the price of one in the hotel. Taxi's in Madrid are not cheap and sometimes we found they were taking advantage and travelling via longer routes than they should. Once you get your bearings use the fantastic metro system, there is a station across the road from the hotel [in the bus station] and for one euro you can travel miles. We would get on at Plaza Castilla and travel to the heart of the city [station Sol] you will come out in the hustle and bustle of the shopping area. Madrid has some wonderful architecture and various old buildings well worth visiting. On leaving we used the metro to travel back to the airport it cost us 2 euros each and comes out in the heart of the terminal. One final point be aware Madrid's weather is totally different from coastal Spain, its very hot in summer and but can be very cold in winter months.
