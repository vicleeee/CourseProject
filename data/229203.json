The price is very reasonable for the amount of standards and service you get. The hotel staff is very nice and polite, as most 4/5 star hotels have and the rooms are spacious and tidy. We had a family suite, which had a lot of space, including a large walk-in-wardrobe and large bathroom. The beds were very comfortable and clean and the room service was great. People who say this hotel is far from the city centre, are completely wrong. Yes, you can't walk to the city centre, but you are a 4-6 minute walking distance away from one of the biggest stations in Berlin (Gesundbrunnen), from where it is just 5 stations to the Brandenburg gate, about 6 to Potzdamer Platz, and an 8 minute underground to Alexanderplatz, which are the main areas of Berlin. You can easily get to about anywhere in the city centre within 20min if you have to change. The area around the hotel was really nice: a lot of take-aways, a huge shopping centre (Gesundbrunnen-Center), grocery stores, and a big park for a walk right in front of the hotel. The only thing I could complain about is the prices of the breakfast, which if it isn't included costs around 17 Euros per person and is just way over the top. The Sauna and mini gym inside the building are great, even though very small. Overall, this hotel is a good hotel for a reasonable price and at a reasonable location with good service and rooms and I'd strongly recommend this to anyone on a budget and still wanting to have a pleasant stay in Berlin.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA good stay\u201d", "Author": "Mr_Puffet", "ReviewID": "UR127143567", "Content": "A fairly decent hotel, I have seen many more from the same franchise with better facilities but this place ticks all of the boxes and there is nothing to complain about.

Restaurant was avergae, but a bit slow with only two service persons working. Breakfast was too expensive to bother, so we bought rolls at nearby bakery. No way to make coffee or tea in room. Nothing special here and some staff were a bit cold. We asked for a quieter room and were told nothing available. After first night, we slept with ear plugs in because the U-Bahn, S-Bahn and regional trains all travel on below grade tracks not far from our window. At night, the walk from train station to hotel is not one for a single woman or with kids.

Also the mall nearby was very handy and also had a very reasonable italian restaurant within it. Negatives, there was no air conditioning in the room, just one fan. Even with the windows open all day and night, it was extremely stuffy in the room. This made getting a decent nights sleep very difficult. We found the breakfast at 16 euros which was not included in our tarrif, too expensive so instead chose to eat out of the hotel. There were cafes nearby which were much more reasonable. Despite being told that if we ate in the restaurant our son would eat free (as he was under 11) when we tried to use the restaurant on the Sunday night we were told we would have to pay for him as well - money making tactics over a marathon weekend!

I am normally not that picky of a person when it comes to hotels but this was not what I expected at all. I got the hotel with a package deal through my travel agent. Otherwise I would have taken heed to all the other reviews about this hotel. My pros for the hotel were: \u2022 The breakfast buffet had a decent variety of food. The eggs weren\u2019t the best but there was tons of fresh fruit and bread to choose from. There was also your typical German breakfast as well. \u2022 The staff in the dinning room were very attentive and remembered you each day you came in and what you drank. So they would make sure your table had it. For me this was a plus as they made sure my son had a glass of cold milk every morning. \u2022 One block from the train station. You can see the hotel sign as soon as you come off the U-bahn. (I recommend getting the Welcome to Berlin card. As it gives you unlimited access to the trains, trams and buses as well as discounts to various locations within Berlin and Potsdam.) My cons for the hotel were: \u2022 Room smelled stale as if someone had smoked in it earlier or something. \u2022 There was a requirement for a deposit for the room for the possibility that you would use the mini bar or order a movie on the TV. This fee was 35 Euros and it was refunded when you checked out as long as you didn\u2019t use either or. \u2022 This hotel does not have AC which was a complete downer for me as it was really warm during the time I was in Berlin \u2022 There is not a safe in the room \u2022 When someone near your room goes into their room it can sound as if they are trying to come into yours \u2022 There was some street noise at night which someone mentioned in another post but it wasn\u2019t as bad for me but I could understand how it could be a nuisance \u2022 The bathroom always sounds like there was water running so I was constantly running in there to make sure my son didn\u2019t leave the water on. \u2022 And my biggest CON of them was the designated smoking area was right in the front lobby of the hotel. So as soon as you walk in on your immediate right the smokers were right there. There was no area closed off for it or anything. It was just wide open. I usually just held my breath until I got closer to the elevator. This is the first time I have stayed in a Holiday Inn like this. I wouldn\u2019t have expected it to be so run down in a sense. The d\u00e9cor was old and need to be updated but I can ignore that if everything else is nice however that was not case. Someone did say something about the area being a little shady so to speak. It is in a Turkish area. I didn't have any problems but I could see how others would feel uncomfortable in the area. As far as I could tell as long as you didn't bother them, they didn't bother you. There is plenty of shopping in the neighborhood. There is also a mall right next to the train station with tons of stores to choose from. There are also vendors that setup during the day there so you can get fresh fruit and things like that. The fruit/veggie vendor was there pretty late most nights. As I noticed after coming in one night. Also, the mall normally closes at 9pm so you are able to get in there and get whatever you need. They do have a kids room in the lobby of the hotel but it was too close to the smoking area for me so I didn't allow my son to play in there. I did not eat dinner in the hotel so I am not sure how it was or cost. I noticed other reviews about the price so I just opted to make sure we ate before coming back or I grabbed snacks from the Real in the mall by the train station.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cDisappointment\u201d", "Author": "acik-pozisyon", "ReviewID": "UR117215396", "Content": "Okay, it's Holiday Inn and it's a five star (at least known brand approach) hotel...

While the hotel was clean and roomy, a staff member was horrendously rude to my family and I and it appears to me that an attempt was made to overcharge us. To preface this, I have traveled in Europe before and consider myself a good traveler \u2013 I know it is not home and that things are different, and I embrace that aspect. I also prepare ahead and check my facts carefully, so this horrible experience was a complete surprise. On this occasion, I was traveling with my family of five (three adults and two teenagers). We booked our room on Holiday-Inn\u2019s website, which described it as a, \u201c\u2026FAMILY SUITE\u2026\u201d for, \u201c\u20265 PERSON(S) MAX PER ROOM\u2026\u201d When I booked, I clearly indicated that we were a party of three adults and two children. The quoted rate, confirmed in my confirmation e-mail, was \u20ac149 + \u20ac20 (labeled as, \u201cExtra Persons Charge / Night.\u201d) = \u20ac169. Prior to coming to the hotel, I called Holiday Inn\u2019s international desk (I do not know the exact name of this department), and confirmed that the ages of the children would not place them in \u201cadult\u201d status at the hotel. I do not think that it was the desk agent who misinformed me, as the events that transpired the day I checked in seem to indicate a hotel-based problem. Per my reservation, my family arrived on October 8. We all entered the lobby together around noon; checked in; verified the number of people, rate, and charges; and signed for our rate. We were advised that our room was not ready, and that we could access it after three. I emphasize that we checked in at this time, and we verified the rate and extra charges with the clerk. At approximately 9:15 the same night we returned from an exhausting day in Berlin and approached the front desk to pick up our key. A different clerk was working. The clerk advised us that we would need to pay \u20ac15 extra for each of the two children (for a total of \u20ac30 extra) as the hotel\u2019s policy was that each extra child had to pay. I politely advised the clerk that we had booked the room at a rate of \u20ac149 plus an additional \u20ac20 for the adults, that we had indicated the presence of two children when reserving, that we were not eating breakfast at the hotel, and that the international desk of Holiday Inn had confirmed that the children would not be considered adults. The clerk\u2019s tone then became, in my perception, very, very rude, and frankly I perceived the clerk\u2019s attitude to be disparaging. The clerk advised us that in addition to our quoted rate we must pay \u20ac30 total for the two children. I offered to show the clerk my confirmation e-mail, but the clerk refused, advising us again of the need to pay \u20ac30 extra. The clerk then advised us that the clerk believed that we were getting an excellent \u201cdeal.\u201d I asked the clerk why it was that we were not informed of the additional \u20ac30 charge when we checked in earlier in the day, and the clerk stated that the charge simply had to be added. I further advised the clerk that had we been told of the charge in the morning when we checked in, I could have sought another hotel with a more reasonable rate during the day. The clerk then had the audacity to say, in what I perceived to be a very rude tone, \u201cYou would leave over 30 euros?\u201d This was stated in front of other guests, and with one of the children in our party present. I advised the clerk that we would, and that we would like for the staff to seek another hotel. Finally, the clerk looked over our records, and indicated that since I am an ICH priority member, the charges would be waived. I should add that it seems audacious that the hotel charges an extra fee for each person after the first adult in a family suite, and that while the fee is \u20ac10 for adults, it is \u20ac15 for children over 12. I personally suspect that the employee interpreted the hotel policy incorrectly, or that the hotel was trying to add fees inappropriately.", "Date": "November 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201ca handy spot for a quick visit\u201d", "Author": "DublinSupersaint", "ReviewID": "UR20186468", "Content": "just back from a 2 day break in this hotel, and have to say really enjoyed my stay here, just a note the address of this hotel is mitte but i think its more in the wedding district as i found when i did my traveling however don't let this put you off. the area is fine and there is a train & underground 15 seconds walk which has easy access to central berlin. also in the area outside the hotel there are shops to suit all plus a large shopping center, on the hotel its self we had a twin room which was fine not very big but done the job also very clean, minibar if required one thing to note here is there is bottled water on your table which i thought was free but on close inspection they was a \u20ac3! charge, i did not eat in the hotel so can say anything about the food the staff were very friendly and the check in was hassle free as was check out would defo stay here again as i worked out my routes for the things i wanted to do in berlin.", "Date": "September 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGood Value, Nice Staff, Interesting Location\u201d", "Author": "GOGraffer", "ReviewID": "UR18793007", "Content": "Holiday Inn-Mitte of Berlin is a good place to stay in Berlin for a number of reasons: (1) It's a good value.

Despite this, the hotel insisted on charging me 10 euros more per night (this was after the extra person fee had already been taken into account). On 4 separate occassions I had to argue with the staff and show them my printout. On each occassion, I was told that I was correct and that the bill would be fixed. However, this only lasted until the next shift started, and then I had the same problems again. The problem even persisted through my departure and I had to work on the situation from home via e-mail. In the end, the problem was fixed and an appropriate refund was made. Outside of the billing problems, I thought that the hotel was a great value for the price, especially considering its close location to the subway. I assume that the billing problems were a freak event, so I would actually recommend this hotel to others. As for myself though, it gave me such a headache that I may try a different hotel next time.", "Date": "May 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201c\"Good location - Good value for money\"\u201d", "Author": "damosp", "ReviewID": "UR6916197", "Content": "We stayed at Holiday inn Berlin Humboldt Park Hotel from 16-02-07 to 19-02-07. We were three couples. The purpose of out trip was the sightseeing of Berlin. The hotel is opposite the metro (Gesundbrunnen station), 4 stops from Alexander-Platz. The neighbourhood is very quiet and full of eating places so you do not really need a breckfast. You can also use the stores in the Gesundbrunnen Centre \u2013 big mall centre outside the Gesundbrunnen station (Open from 08:00-22:00, food stores open around 09:00 and most of the stores at 10:00 - closed on Sundays). The rooms were clean, well decorated and functioned. The bed was comfortable but the quilt was short and narrow. We solved that problem by putting on maximum the heating. The breakfast was nice, but we suggest the food from the streets\u2026 The main advantage of this hotel was the staff: Friendly, polite, quick and efficient. They really tried to be helpful in every way. They helped us in ticket issuing and gave us directions for the metro and sightseeing. We would definitely stay to that hotel in the future because is a great value for money. Some tips about the transport and the city: The metro system and especially trains (S-Bahn) is quite complicated so do your homework before travelling, then visit the information store at the airport (any airport), ask there anything you need and take the necessary maps. Even Schonefeld airport is located inside zone B, so you will probably only have to use a ticket for AB zones only for going from the airport to the city center. The WelcomeCard 2007 [--] is probably a wise choice for a 2 or 3 days stay, but check it at the information store. If you miss that, you won\u2019t have the opportunity to ask anybody at the train station (at least at Schonefeld airport). Be careful: There is also the CityTourCard 1-2\u20ac chipper but probably the Welcome Card is much better as it has more discounts that the CityTourCard [--]. At train station there are only automatic machines issuing tickets (and the cards) but as you will probably find a lot of people queuing there it will not be possible for you to have a throughout look of the system and understand it. We did not have a good search at the machines but it looks like that some machines sell the Welcome card or CityTourCard and other ones no so, be careful!! Each time you use a train, double check the correct platform and the correct train which I am not quite sure how you will find it (prefer to find a German to ask but not expect much especially if you do not speak good German). We experienced people telling as wrong info and others giving the correct ones even in the same wagon :( A convenient way to have a quick look of the city centre are bus lines 100 and 200. Many people do not speak English for example at Potsdam Hauptbahnhof info store, but they print you the schedule of the trains (it depends on your skills though to find the correct train). If you are going to visit the Sanssouci Palace and the rest of palaces at Potsdam, be prepared that the tour is guided only in German language. They give you a brochure in English, but most of the telling remains a mystery to you (Especially when people ask things, etc)! Of course you pay for a guided tour and they do not allow you to do it by yourself!!", "Date": "March 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Son, Norway", "Title": "\u201cOK for the price\u201d", "Author": "Vardomannen", "ReviewID": "UR6813594", "Content": "Good location within easy reach of all of Berlin's major sights. However this didn't compensate too much for the step back in time. I lived in Warsaw for a while in the early 1990's and was transported back to my younger days by the interior and smells of this hotel. There was something strange and somewhat surreal about the whole experience. The corridors smelled as if they hadn't been aired - a kind of musty / stagnant water smell. The wide corridors also reminded me of East European public buildings of a bygine era. Once into the room however, the smell and ambience disappeared. This is one of the more standard Holiday Inns I've stayed in, although for a price of 79 Euro in the centre of berlin, I suppose you get what you pay for. I got no recognition as a Platinum Card Holder - the hotel may well have been fully booked or something, but no explanation was forthcoming (I speak fluent German, so it wasn't due to language difficulties). On the plus side; the room was clean and functional. Nothing more, nothing less. No tea/coffee facilities (am I getting to demanding in my old age?), and a minimum amount of towels in the room (or was there just one towel - I forget) but there are plenty of cafes and restaurants in the area, mostly Turkish / Asian, but the ones I tried were good. The hotel is a 5-minute-walk from the train station at Gesundbrunnen from where you can access any part of Berlin. Would I recommend it? If you're looking for a fairly basic, but clean hotel, in what seemed like an OK area of town and can get a good rate, then go for it. If you're expecting anything unusual, extraordinary, spectacular or rememberable, then go elsewhere.", "Date": "February 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Finland", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay at for the cityshopper\u201d", "Author": "morrisen", "ReviewID": "UR6567698", "Content": "We stayed in a suite, and paid 26 \u20ac each/night.

The breakfast was very good, with a huge variety of food that catered for all tastes. We had one evening meal at the restaurant that frankly was a let down. Go else where. We had a fantastic time at the Christmas markets-we found that food, drink and fairground rides were very reasonably priced.

Arriving at 12.30 we were even allowed into the room - which smoked badly after smoke. The staff were sorry and reaccomodated us into a non smoking suite, which proved to be two rooms with four beds each instead of a separate living room. We were not happy at all. Later in the afternoon the (new) receptionist told us that the first room would have been a non smoking room and she was looking for a solution. Meanwhile we were offered a free cup of coffee. She came up with a non smoking suite opposite to the first room. Well, the way it smelled it was a quickly over perfumed smoking room but we did not object. Later in the night I heard a funny noise as if someone would try to get into our room. When I opened the door (with the \"do not disturb\" tag at the handle) I met a very surprised couple which said that they are assigned to this room. The receptionist wrote down a wrong number (it was the opposite room instead, our first one). The second morning (Sunday) we tried the breakfast buffet. The restaurant looks a bit dark on enterin it but has some natural light in the rear. The tables are quite big and there is enough space between them. The buttet is ok, not really good, not really bad. The service personnel was close to being unkind, what I found annoying. The location is good because it is close to the underground and S-Bahn Gesundbrunnen. This station is served by the circle line (S-Bahn) and the north-west-connection going to Friedrichstrasse. The underground serves Alexanderplatz. Next to the hotel is the entrance to a historic tunnel system built during war time. It can be visited by guided tours. All in all, the hotel is good if you want clean and bright rooms and that's it.
