Yet there was something we have not been aware of. The hotel itself as rather away from the airport and the promised shuttle bus is running only for sertain time of the day - so when we arrived to the airport shortly after 23.00 we had no chance to get the shuttle and had to use the cab. According to some rules the minimum ride costs at Barcelona airport is 20 euro (it turns to be 22 to the hotel!!!) so be very careful for this extra cost. We have arrived to the hotel and the not too friendly night portier checked us in, explaining that whatever we want is also extra cost. At the same time he has refused to the group of other waiting persons telling that hotel is full - so keep this in mind when you have no booking (yet the \"street\" cost for the room is relatively high for the area and service). At the rooms you have pretty basic level - yet few could be defenitly improved already at the first site - bar fridge was not running, TV had only Spanish chanels and there were nothing extra you may expect from the Best Western Hotel level. Extra disappointing was the bathroom and the shower - the bath tap you may not use is you are not phisically in the bath tub - i.e. you need to get undressed and take you socks off get in switch the water, make your feet wet and get off - or may be they ment not to use the tub. The shower itself was leacking in a few spots - that made it hard to use - so overall the bath / shower unit was relativelly poor for four stars even in Spain and for sure not up to Best Western Standsrds. The shuttle to the airport is running every half an hour - so keep it in mind (especially taking into acount that it is ca 15 minutes ride!). The very last point was that the day portier was not accepted my Frequent Flyer card saying that is not accepted here only the Best Western Cards are running, which made a single night stay complete with the cherry on the top. My recomendation - unless it is extremely cheap for money or you have no chance to stop over in the area - avoid this hotel - there are better in the area and in the city which is off 10 more minutes.

(1) Dinner Example: we stood at the hotel restaurant to be seated for about 5 minutes (only two tables occupied and no one waiting in line before us) and after the waiter and waitress walked by us about 4 times (completely ignoring us) we tried to walk to a nearby restaurant. We asked the receptionist for directions how to get to this other recommended restaurant (the lobby monitors say that they love providing helpful maps and directions for these types of recommendations) and were told to go around the corner for about 200 meters (as they point their finger, then continue doing desk work). However, around the corner looks like you're passing into private territory with a gate and toll booths for cars, so we didn't dare pass it. The second time we asked the receptionist, he said it was 300 meters PAST the toll booth gate, then ran away from us (literally). (2) Other Service Example: The booklets in the room indicated that if we needed any additional toiletries, adapters, chargers, etc. we only needed to ask and they would provide it to us free of charge (sounds like a great convenience, right?). However, when I go to the receptionist to ask for an extra bath sponge, I am told that we are only allowed 1/room (however, two people share a room...how does that work, exactly?), and he refused to give us another one. Maybe we caught the entire staff on an off-night, but overall the service at this hotel was AWFUL.

Buffet Breakfast is 14 EUR pp. -Pretty secluded area with no restaurants /shops in vicinity - No subway connectivity.So if you have to go from any other stop apart from where bus stops,you have to shift to Subway. Not quite comfortable. -While coming back from bus you need to know the exact name of stop as we had difficulty there are many stops with similar name. -No coffee tea machines Overall this hotel is a very good option for people doing a stay over between airport travels or connecting flights to catch. If you have a long stay in Barcelona the location is definitely an issue,so prefer something in the city instead.Even though we stayed only for 2 nights we did feel the location pinch.", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, AB", "Title": "\u201cCheap, Clean, Close to Airport; Somewhat Remote\u201d", "Author": "mrfarenheit", "ReviewID": "UR112481960", "Content": "My wife, my young son and I stayed here for one night at the end of a cruise, before flying home.

He had a very calm nautrue about him even with many guests waiting for him to check them in/out. He worked with us to obtain the best room types for our group and he was excellent!! The hallways are kind of an ugly yellow color but the rooms themselves are very nicely furnished and a good size for European standards. The free internet is invaluable to us since most of us are in the Technology Business. The food is OK. Not bad, not great. Soda and coffee is a little pricey. The mini bar in the room is less expensive and very convenient. The bus to 2 blocks from Las Ramblas and the Marina, the very active center of Barcelona stops right in front of the hotel. OK for the bad comment, the shuttle bus driver was the worst I have ever encountered in any airport hotel in the world and we travel a lot! We had one guest with an electric wheelchair and I asked the driver not to put luggage in the van until we got the chair in first. He ignored me and put the luggage anyway. When the chair came down the elevator and out to the van it would not fit. He refused to take out the luggage and try to work with us to get the wheelchair and luggage in so my Husband and I had to unpack all suitcases including those that did not belong to our party, put the wheelchar in and then all the luggage in again. It all fit just fine but he was very RUDE, inconsiderent and defiant. This was a terrible end to a great stay. If it wasn't for the shuttle bus driver, I would have given this hotel a 5 circle rating. Instead I give it 4 circles.

I was by myself at that point, and I only went back to Barcelona to catch my return flight to the U.S. Having stayed in some pretty nice Best Westerns, I figured this would be a perfectly satisfactory place to spend the night. My flight from London arrived in Barcelona at around 10 pm, and it was nearly midnight before I got to the hotel. I watched other hotel shuttles circle around three and four times before the Hotel Alfa van came, and the only thing that prevented me from just going to another hotel was that I had paid for the room in advance. Once the shuttle finally arrived, I boarded with three other men who were apparently inebriated. As a female traveling by myself, I was a little uncomfortable with the situation and just wanted to get to the hotel as quickly as possible. However, instead of going directly to the hotel, we for some reason still unknown to me, stopped along the way in an abandoned car dealership for about five minutes, listening to something on the radio in Catalan. Perhaps it was some type of sporting event? In any case, I was convinced that I was going to be raped, murdered, or both because it is pretty darn sketchy when a hotel shuttle doesn't bring you directly to the hotel. Nothing actually did happen, but it was still one of the scariest moments of my life. Even if I ended up at the nicest hotel on earth after that, I still would have extremely negative associations with this hotel. As other reviews have mentioned, the hotel itself is mediocre. I didn't have any particular problems with the room (or the return shuttle trip), but I certainly was expecting a nicer hotel. At the very least, all I wanted was a direct, uninterrupted shuttle ride from the airport to the hotel that didn't instill the fear of God in me! I wish that I had just taken a taxi back to the Hotel Apart Silver, where I stayed during my actual visit to Barcelona. I probably would have gotten there faster, and it was a fabulous hotel (not to mention that some of the rooms were cheaper than the Best Western!)", "Date": "July 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cGood airport hotel\u201d", "Author": "HarshadDASWANI", "ReviewID": "UR17328571", "Content": "As far as airport hotels go, this one was good.

Some are good, some are questionable. I was at a conference in the city and as a result of an admin 'issue' my company didn't book my hotel until the last minute - the Alfa was the only hotel available. The hotel is located some 15 minutes drive from the Airport on the edge of an industrial estate. Inside it is modern and clean with good Wi-Fi access across all rooms (though this was down the first day I was there). Those are the good points My problems started on arrival at the Airport with the supposedly 'regular' shuttle. After waiting over half an hour I gave the hotel a call. They said it was 15 mins away. 15 mins later it went sailing straight past Terminal B as it had a full load from Terminal A. It was some 30 mins later, and after another call, that I was eventually picked up. Throughout my stay the bus proved unreliable and difficult to rely upon. The advertised free service into Barcelona centre is one-way only, and they refuse to pick anyone up on the 2nd drop even though they're going back to the hotel! I was given a no-smoking room on check-in, but when I got to the room it STANK of cigarette's. When I complained, they insisted on walking with me to the room to check out my claims. Only very grumpily (this attitude was representative of the staff attitudes) did they give me another room which was actually a smoking room, but smelt better!! Apparently the locals don't take any notice of no-smoking rules! The bathroom is very nice to look at, being of a modern design, but mine stank of drains/sewers. I loved the design of the sink, but realised how impractical it was when I saw there was no way of filling up the sink as there was no conventional plug hole. You also got a good spray back if you turned on the tap too much, and the step was a real trip hazard. The \"air conditioning\" was non-existent and the room was overly warm, and this was November, heaven knows what it would be like in summer! You couldn't have the window open as heavy vehicles outside woke you up, and the walls were paper thin. More seriously for me was that I had to rely on taxi's to get me into the centre - it is nowhere near Barcelona's excellent metro system. Some taxi drivers were good but some obviously tried to fleece tourists. A popular move seems to be to add 'surcharges' for going outside the city limits, or it being a Sunday, when other drivers hadn't applied them! About a third didn't seem to know where it was, even given the address (and many had SatNav!!). Checking out took me 45 mins as the bill was dubious to say the least. With a supposed corporate B&B rate, they had charged me for breakfast which they refused to budge on.

Considering this, the Hotel Alfa is amazingly inept at providing this simple service. After two weeks traveling Spain, we booked the Alfa so we would be close to the airport for our 8 a.m. flight back to the U.S. First of all, the hotel really is NOT all that close to the airport. It is probably 5 miles away and that means a 20-30 Euro cab ride, depending on luggage. Don't depend on the hotel van, it runs when they feel like it. And don't depend on a wake-up call to get you on the road. We checked with the front desk twice before going to bed, and they STILL did not place the wake up call. We had to rush as a result. Remember, this is supposed to be an airport hotel. Wake up calls would seem to be a basic, right? The staff borders on rude. They know they will probably never see you again, and they act that way. We asked for extra pillows; had the front desk clerk simply said \"NO,\" we might not have been surprised. Instead, he drilled us on why we wanted extra pillows and suggested that we actually didn't need them!! Totally nuts. In the end, they never did send the pillows. The rooms, even on the smoke-free floors, are imbued with years of nicotine. The no smoking rule is simply not enforced. Our friends room included sheets that were riddled with cigarette burn marks...on the no smoking floor! The bathrooms are cramped and badly in need of a facelift and include only the bare necessities. The restaurant food was fine, but the service was, without any doubt, the worst we experienced anywhere in Spain. They must be trained by the same people who train the front desk. Again, this place is supposed to be an airport hotel. Quick, good food served with a smile should be the order of the day. They don't even come close. The Alfa bills itself as a four-star hotel. This is an insult to the rating system. It barely deserves a single star. FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO STAY when trying to be near the airport in Barcelona.
