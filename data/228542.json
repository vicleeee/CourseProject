With marriot status we were able to book a great rate the night before. We were driving in from France and making a one night stop over in Madrid before our London departure....BIG MiSTAKE. Being the nieve Americans that we are we decided that the new AC collection by Marriot would be up to the standards of other Marriots...no it was not. Where do I begin besides the fact that I was terrified of having my luggage stolen off the street curb( ok maybe I was just paranoid) but it seemed a little sketchy. If you are a tourist or even a business traveler this location is in a very residential part of town. My room had pull down metal chains over the window and I choose to keep them closed to avoid my view of the neighbors drying laundry rack. Oh and the burglar bars come in handy because their is NO hotel safe. However, if you have some extreme valuables that you can't risk loosing you can store them at the check-in counter for a mere 10 euros. If you enjoy working out then avoid, they actually put a treadmill in an empty room and declared it a workout facility. When we decided that the Fanta in the mini bar would not do... we ventured out.... to a world of nothing. A mediocre pizza place down the street was our only option. However, the streetwalkers advised us of the china shop across the street where we could buy everything from special k cereal to a fake iPod. We decided to save for breakfast.

Also the beds were incredibly comfortable. The staff were friendly, and helpful (and we came just as this place was switching over to Marriott so we heard some about that). We also got an excellent price, even at the last minute. The location was ok - certainly doable, especially if you are comfortable navigating public transportation and/or are willing to pay for a taxi. It probably took about 35-40 minutes to get from the hotel to the Prado for example, if you took the metro. We mostly did that, although one night we took a cab which was reasonable because we split it four ways. We did not eat the breakfast because it seemed pretty expensive. We didn't spend much time in the neighborhood. It was certainly safe there, but we had trouble picking out a place to eat.

I needed something that was close to downtown Madrid without costing an arm and two legs. I have to say, I wasn't disappointed with my selection. First, the good: The rooms have that modern, art deco look and feel to them, complete with hardwood floors, minimal furniture, glass-counter sinks, low lighting, and hunter green marble tile in the bathroom. The wood sliding doors, sporting frosted glass, make the closets -- when the light is on -- the most beautiful I've ever seen in a hotel. The food isn't bad, but there are much cheaper options right in the area. If you want to eat in the hotel, be sure to confirm the menu with the front desk because the offerings change erratically depending on the time of day. I'm not sure if that is due to the fact that I was there in August (the entire city pretty much shuts down for \"holiday\") and attendance was rather slim. The housekeeping staff does a fantastic job cleaning the rooms. One in particular, Luda, had my room looking like I'd never stepped foot in it. Now, the bad: I don't have very many complaints with AC. The three things that did bother me are: 1) No clock in the room (is that a Spain thing?); 2) The fitness \"center\" is actually two bicycles, a treadmill, and a weight rack; and 3) Charging 12 euros for 24-hour Wifi in your room (although it's free in the lobby) is a bit ridiculous. That's my take on AC Avenida. It was a pleasant stay, and I would recommend it to those who like the bare essentials with a little flavor.

I like the AC properties because there is a standard across all of them that is good. It is nice to know what to expect when you use these properties. There was one drawback this time. The AC properties in Spain have turned off their air conditioning for the winter. This makes the room very warm and stuffy.

This is a very nice extra we have not experienced in any other city hotel. Also in the rooms free soft drinks and beer are provided in the mini bar which is nice. The bedrooms are very good, reasonable space, modern decor. Maybe some spring cleaning of soft furnishings is needed but not a big deal. The beds are really comfortable and with good pillows. Heat is more than adequate and adjustable. Twin rooms are recommended as they are slighly larger than doubles, apparently. The bathroom is very good, spotless and with nice fittings. An excellent shower with lashings of hot water, and nice little lotions, gels etc available. Location wise, this hotel is not in the tourist centre but is about two minutes walk from the metro station Cartegena, and the metro system is super and easy to use. 10 journey tickets are about \u20ac6 and can be used on metro and bus.

Like others have said this hotel certainly does punch above its three-star rating. I later spent a couple more nights at a five-star hotel (Palacio del Retiro) in the same AC brand and the Avda. de America being equally ritzy though obviously smaller genuinely did share all the upmarket style of the four-times more expensive establishment. Good: Luxurious fake marble bathroom with bidet and all kinds of little packets containing razor, toothbrush, sponge, lotions, the works. Room decor very elegant with polished wood everywhere and classy illuminated wardrobe. Some nuisance from corridor door-slam but otherwise not noisy. Siemens aircon unit looked new and serviceable although I didn't need it in November, and nice bed (on the firm side) with spotless crisp white sheets. Free minibar, and free airport transfers (Monday thru Friday only so I didn't use that either.) Bad: Not much actually but TV was all-Spanish apart from CNN and they wanted 5 Euros for an hour of wireless internet usage. The Spanish are tobacco enthusiasts and I specified a no-smoking room so was predictably banished to the back of the hotel with a fine view of the fire-escape. Room was slightly on the small side too. I didn't care about any of this apart from the internet stinginess but if TV is important to you then maybe consider elsewhere. On arrival the front desk people were very friendly and helpful - I didn't have much contact with them otherwise but I saw none of the surly attitude mentioned earlier. I think the cause of this hotel's surprising value for money is the location - it is down a nondescript street in a residential (urban high-rise tenement) area which superficially appearing suitable neither for business nor tourism might put some people off. Personally I thought it was very charming having the constant contact with local families walking out with their children and so on. Also it's around five minutes easy walk to the huge transport hub that takes you anywhere in the city fast via their cheap clean safe Metro system. I am not that easily satisfied but at 84 Euros +tax this hotel exceeded all my expectations.

The breakfast is a bit overpriced for what you get especially as Madrid is overflowing with Cafe's. There is one around the corner that is priced for locals.

They suggested a smoking room instead due to their bigger size and we couldn't have been more pleased. The room was indeed of a great size, the bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was spotless, completely tiled in green marble. The extras are what made this hotel so great. The minibar, full of soft-drinks, was free, and re-stocked every day, there was a cybercafe and gym on-site and a special room with free snacks and beverages until 7pm.
