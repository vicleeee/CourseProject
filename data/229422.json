That's all well and good, but theres something to be said for a hotel with wonderful amenities after a full day of sightseeing and taking in all the sights. This hotel is not only wonderfully comfortable, but the staff is friendly and very professional. I did not feel like I was cheating myself by not staying in a more rustic hotel. I loved going back to the room at the end of the day and enjoying a state of the art room with television where I could get news in English! The beds were the most comfortable that we had experienced on our trip. The only draw back is that it is a bit out of the main center, but easily to access everywhere you would want to go. The food here was quite good, and it was the only place in Italy with eggs that were edible! An iron in the room, and a coffee pot as well, were those little touches that you appreciate when traveling.

It provided a complimentary bus to the centre of Rome which we used regularly as the Hotel itself is a good bit away from the centre. There is also a public bus outside the hotel which provided the same service but more regularly for a few euro. The rooms are a bit dated but I found the hotels in general very expensive in Rome and slightly dated so this was perfect for the price we payed. We did not eat at the hotel, but there is a fantastic little place a few yards up from the hotel (I cant remember the name).

They even provided a small, free, aromatherapy sleep kit during our stay with lavender linen mist. We are loyal to the Intercontinental/Holiday Inn brands and could of stayed in downtown Rome area, but liked the spa the Crowne had to offer and the shuttle service. Also, most of the downtown hotels were double the price of the Crowne Plaza and we spend little time in our room when traveling. Nonetheless, we had a lovely king room with a balcony, honor bar, and a large bathroom complete with bidet, fluffy robe and slippers for the spa. We thought it was an excellent value for the price, comfort, service and amenities. A couple of helpful things to know before you go: If needed, the hotel can usually change money for guests for a lot less then the banks or money changing businesses which sometimes charge up to 30-40%; if you stay here, and could use the down time, make time to try the spa and steam rooms; finally, there is a great little restaurant a few minutes walk down the road called La Nocetta", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "Franca P", "ReviewID": "UR127588567", "Content": "We were surprised to find a beautiful hotel in a very nice setting.

We booked this hotel for the pool facilities for my teenagers, needless to say we were too busy to try them out! Firstly the positives: Breakfast...absolutely superb, everything you could look for even a glass of bubbly if you so wanted. Rooms....modern, large bathrooms for Rome with good house keeping. Negatives or the not so goods! Our first impression wasnt great to be honest, the reception area is quite frankly very tired, although there was a notice up saying that is was being refurbed. That did not excuse the dirty enterance doors, carpets etc. Thankfully the rooms did go someway towards putting things right as you do spend more time in your room than the reception....thankfully!!! Staff... Answered when spoken to I guess, but more interested in the business clientelle was my impression. Location.....do not underestimate the distance to the centre...yes only twenty minutes and yes there is a courtesy bus, but for a short trip when you want to pack things in, its not the best. We didnt wander out at night as the hotel is situated on a very busy main road, so we tended to stay in. I found it much better to be in the centre and if you discounted the average nightly taxi fare of around 20 euros each trip it soon mounts up. The bus time table isnt that great either particularly coming home so please bear that in mind. Woulld I stay again, no, because I would rather be in the centre with all it has to offer. If you prefer a quieter located large hotel then this could be for you....horses for courses and all that! Would be good in the summer to have access to the outside pool area too. One other thing if booking the tour buses go for Cristina Rome, they have the pale yellow buses, way more buses with a great timetable.

The staff were particularly helpful to us and responded to all enquiries with patience and understanding often giving us really useful advice to avoid queues! Yes, it is a 10 minute bus ride from the centre of Rome but this is made clear on the information you receive before booking so we knew what to expect. We used the courtesy shuttle bus in conjunction with the service buses (1\u20ac per person journey/s within 75 mins). The normal pattern was to leave on the 9am bus and return mid-afternoon on the service bus to benefit from time to relax in our room then swim in the indoor pool and use other facilities available in the Wellness suite before our evening meal. We booked for a week on a half board basis and felt it was very good value for money. Our ratings below show what we felt about the facilities.

Staff - I don't understand why other guests on the reviews are moaning about the lack of customer service from the staff, they were lovely and very helpful if we had any problem. This was my first holiday abroad with just myself and my partner and we found them very accommodating. They sorted the hotel to airport transfer for us and the staff at breakfast were friendly and happy even if it was 6.30am! (We didn't choose to get up at 6.30am it was our airport transfer bus lol) Location - I thought the location was brilliant, Rome can be a bit stressful sometimes, cars coming at you in every direction and Crowne Plaza is situated a little bit on the outskirts which is perfect if you have just had a long day of walking and sight seeings. The hotel shuttle bus was really efficient for us, we would take it to St.Peters in the morning and be picked up downtown around 5.15pm.There is also a lovely restaurant next door if you were looking to venture out. Food - We were on a bed and breakfast basis and I loved it. Some people on here aren't happy with it but what's not to like? There was scrambled eggs, toast, sausages, bacon, cereal, hot drinks, cold drinks, croissants, cakes. Loads to choose from! Hotel in general - The spa is amazing, loved the log fire and the way it was set out. Very peaceful with a lovely pool, jacuzzi and sauna. The bed was the comfiest bed I may have ever slept in. The rooms itself had everything you need, it was also spotless - could not fault it! Overall I definitely will be returning to a Crowne Plaza hotel, maybe not this particular one as I feel I've seen Rome but if all the other Crowne Plaza hotel's are a mirror of this one then I definitely will be booking soon.

The staff is very courteous and definitely willing to help in any way. Rooms are spacious and nicely appointed; worth noticing are the very comfortable beds adorned with lots of pillows and a useful desk for most business needs. The bathroom is very functional with a bathtub/shower and good lighting. Isolation, both thermal and acoustic, is good under all circumstances. Air conditioning in the room is very effective and its noise is barely noticeable. The two restaurants (the Osteria for lunch and dinners, the Jardin d'Hiver for breakfast) are comfortable and never overcrowded: tables are well spaced and lighting is adequate for every time of the day. Breakfast at the Jardin d'Hiver is absolutely a great way to start a day with an amazing view of the pool. Lunch and dinner's offers accommodate virtually everyone's wishes. The restaurant staff always goes the extra mile and never let you down. Having a drink at bar Il Palco is a treat; after 8pm live music is played and often it goes on later than 2 am. This alone is already is worth the stay. Checking-in and out is very quick and you never have to wait longer than a few minutes. There are shuttles to/from Fiumicino airport (trip time about 20 minutes) and to/from downtown (trip time about 15 minutes). Even if not centrally located, there is a public bus stopping just outside the hotel's entrance that brings you to the nearest underground stop, which is 10 minutes away if you walk directly from the hotel. The trip to downtown (Piazza di Spagna, Piazza del Popolo, via Veneto) is then merely 10-15 minutes. The main train station -Roma Termini- is 25 minutes away. If you come by car the free parking is a plus. The three swimming pools (two outside -one of which for children- and one inside in the spa) are themselves worth the stay; the fitness centre is open from 6am to 9pm.

This was an inauspicious beginning to my trip. Problems with the restaurant at the hotel: I was ignored for 20 minutes while 2 couples were waited on and served (there was no one else in the restaurant but the 2 couples and me). Finally my order was taken. The next day after I finished my dinner and the plates were taken away I waited another 20 minutes for a server to ask if I wanted dessert or coffee. I spoke to the hostess and she said she would ask the chef if he had something other than the fruit salad that had been on the buffet all day. When I returned to my seat my liter of water was gone and no one had presented me with a bill. The maitre d' came over to ask if he could do something after I had again sat down. He very nicely offered to find me a piece of chocolate cake and offered to comp me some wine.

Everything was perfect, the spacious room, with its lovely view on the outside swimming-pool, its cleanliness, the comfort of the bed, (let me add that I appreciated the gentle soap with essential oil of bitter almonds in the bathroom), the food in the restaurants, the kindness of the waiters, the shuttle services to Vatican, city center and to the airport. This hotel offers all comfort to its guests, internal swimming-pool, hammam, sauna, jacuzzi and the huge outside pool (25x13.5 meters). I have chosen this Crowne Plaza because of its fitness-Spa area and its excellent equipment, the shuttle services and last but not least the outstanding reception and the professionalism of its whole staff. The concierge explained with patience where to go and what to visit. The staff is kind, helpful and very friendly. It is my second visit and I look forward to the third one. All in all, I loved my stay in this marvellous city : the eternal Rome. .", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wetherby", "Title": "\u201c4 Day Break in Rome\u201d", "Author": "WetherbySteve460", "ReviewID": "UR118917621", "Content": "Just back from a 4 day break in Rome at the Crowne Plaza. One of the main criticisms people seem to raise is the location of the hotel. If you book it knowing where it's located, and take advantage of the excellent shuttle bus then it's a really good quiet location for a nice break - especially if you're lucky with the weather and get to take advantage of the outdoor pool area! The rooms are excellent, nice & large and all appear to have balconies. The breakfast selection is very good, including cereals, fruit, pastries, right through to a reasonable cooked selection, with all the usual selection of fruit juices, coffee, teas etc. The bar area is nice & relaxed, drinks possibly slightly over-priced, but all served with crisps & nuts which is a nice touch. The free shuttle is excellent, running to the Vatican in the morning, and into the centre of town at night, returning hourly between 4.15pm-9.15pm, Taxis though are reasonably priced back to the hotel - ranging between 10-15 euros depending where you get them from.

Pulling up to the hotel, the exteriour was slightly disappointing, it looked old and run down, but once we got inside everything looked new and clean. We arrived around 11:00 a.m. and were graciously allowed to check-in early. As we had not slept for a day (long flight) this was very welcome! Our room was clean and larger than I expected. We had a king size bed and it was very comfortable. I would recommend that you utilize the bus service the hotel offers to the Vatican and the city center. Not only because it's an easy way to get to some site-seeing places, but because of the driver, Stephano. He is very knowledgeable about the area and he marked on a map several places to eat, shop and have a drink near the hotel that we would not have found otherwise. Also, on our return trip from the city center, he took us past the St. Peter's Bascillica at night and it was beautiful! If not for this bus trip, I would not have had the opportunity to see the bascillica at night! There is not alot to see around the hotel, so if you do want to do some site seeing you'll need to travel by taxi or bus if you don't utilize the service the hotel provides. The pool area was nice and there was a place to get cool beverages - but they were expensive! Also, even though we are Platinum Priority Club members, we did not get any free breakfast coupons like we normally do (and it appears most everyone else had!) so while breakfast was good (the chocolate croissants were fabulous!) it was expensive also. The hotel set up a private transfer for us from the hotel to the cruise ship in Civitavecchia. The driver showed up on time, carried our luggage (and there was lots of it!) and got us to the port in style! We were very happy with this service they hotel set up for us! Overall, the St. Peter's Crowne Plaza was a good place to stay before our trip.

Generally the hotel was nice. The reason for going there was our wedding anniversary, so we asked our travel agent to ask them for a very nice room for this reason. So, that's what our agent did and as we were informed they would do their best to please us. Also, we booked a seat at the shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel because the hotel is far from the airport and far from the centre of Rome, so we had first to go there and get familiar with the means of transport and then start to use them. The hotel staff told our agent to tell us to print out from their website the place from where we could pick the shuttle bus and the itinerary of this bus. Despite the fact that we had to stay 1 hour to the airport because the shuttle bus was arriving at the airport every hour (that was not convenient), we preferred it this way because it seamed the easier way to go to the hotel (we had heard that there are taxi drivers outside the airport who are not licensed and generally that taxis are expensive). When we arrived at the airport and checked out we went straight to where our map said and waited for the shuttle bus. In order to be sure that we were at the right waiting place, we showed the map to some airport staff and asked them, but they said that they didn't understand the map and probably we were at the right place but they weren't sure. We saw that many shuttle buses from other hotels were coming and picking up people but despite the fact that the scheduled hour was passing we couldn't see the Crowne Plaza bus. We went that area back and forth with our luggage probably a hundred times and finally at the end of that area - far from any other shuttle bus- we saw a bus with the name of the hotel. The driver had was lying at his seat and was almost sleeping. When we asked him why did he stop there, he told us that he got confused because the pick up point had recently changed!...and of course he wasn't interested in trying to find us despite the fact that we were the only passengers that had booked a seat for this hour. When we finally got to the hotel, 2 hours after we had arrived at the airport, we told the receptionist what happened but she wasn't very interested for our problem and the worst part is that the room that they gave us had a back view of the hotel where the hotel's garbage were thrown and next to a school full of children yelling and playing when going out. The person from the hotel who had received our agent's email for a nice room obviously ignored it! When my husband saw that, went down to the reception again and asked for better room and finally we got a nicer room with a pool view. Mr.Alli and Mrs Marianna at the reception helped us with this problem. This room was wonderful! The other setback was that the schedule of the shuttle bus to the centre of Rome was not convenient. Also, the room was really hot and there was not any airconditioning but it was very clean(every day it was cleaned thoroughly). Breakfast was really good. Also, the staff at the breakfast lounge was wonderful (I think the woman in charge was called Veronica-wonderful person-and really polite and helpful) and the staff and food at the hotel's restaurant was also very good. We met another driver from the one that picked us from the airport who took us to the Vatican area, who was really polite and suggested us where to eat and what to see. Pool area was good but there wasn't good service there. We sat at the pool area and drunk two beverages before leaving the hotel but when we saw our bill we realised that the prices were almost two times higher than the ones at the catalogue that we had seen before ordering. We told it to the waitor who asked us for his apologies and brought us a new bill with the correct prices. So, if we hadn't asked for a catalogue before ordering we would have payed the beverages twice their prices.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens", "Title": "\u201cDecent!\u201d", "Author": "djibrilliant", "ReviewID": "UR118527794", "Content": "Large conference hotel, further from the city centre.

Breakfast was a good experince compared to the food in rome as it is very expensive and not up to standard. Be aware eating in is double the price so ask first. There is a bus outside the hotel which takes you into the city centre for 1euro but you have to purchase ticket from hotel. Do not eat at the restaurant next to the hotel as it is very expensive and the servie is very poor we waited over an hour for french fries and they do not serve pizza during the day.

Firstly we entered the lobby and it felt a bit like a cattle market! There was a big Russian tour group checking in, and there wasn\u2019t any kind of queuing process!! Not what you really want to see when you arrive. As a Platinum member I tried to stand in the dedicated queue, which wasn\u2019t much help. After about 20 minutes we were able to check in! We did get a sorry for the delay but that was about it. We were issued out keys and that was that. I had booked a standard room, but not sure if I was placed in upgraded room, as it did have complimentary water, chocolate, in addition to the standard tea and coffee. The room itself was well appointed with flat screen TV, safe, ironing board, robes and slippers. Could not fault the room. House keeping was a bit hit and miss and wasn\u2019t consistent. One day we wouldn\u2019t have the tea replaced, the next the shampoo wasn\u2019t replaced, another day our dirty towels were left on the seat, the next we had additional rubbish left from another room (an empty tissue box and dirty glass!) Breakfast wasn\u2019t that fantastic for a 4 star hotel. They had about 3 hot dishes, and various cold meats, breads, cereal, 2 types of juices. Would have expected something like an egg station at least in a 4 star hotel. The waiters again were hit and miss, some days they would ask if you wanted tea or coffee, other days wouldn\u2019t get asked at all. So best to go help yourself! Other amenities at the hotel included the swimming pool, which was a nice relief from the Roman hot weather. But don\u2019t expect a lot from the life guard. Most of the time, when he was there, he spent playing on his phone. If I had children I would look after them myself! And help yourself to towels! The hotel also ran a shuttle service from the hotel to the Vatican in the morning and then hotel to the city centre in the evening. This was actually the best bit of the hotel! The drivers were always helping and welcoming. The shuttles were always on time and always got a seat. Overall I think reception did let the hotel down. Other than the queuing problem with the tour group, they never seemed to every have enough staff on, so you always had to wait, even to ask the simplest of questions. The night before checking out I asked where I could check in online for my flight. I was told in the business centre, I asked if there was a charge and was told there wasn\u2019t for checking in. I went to the business centre (which is opposite the reception), logged in and then was told I needed an access number. Surely the receptionist would have known this?? I went back to reception and asked another member of staff who advised me I had to pay?!?! When I said his colleague just said it was free, he pulled a face. When I said I'll just talk to her again, he gave me an access code. So personally, I would pick another hotel next time. Practical points - If you haven\u2019t booked breakfast, then you can purchase it cheaper if you book ahead at a cost of 14 Euros, opposed to 18 Euros per person. Pick up a shuttle timetable from reception when you check in, and get the receptionist mark the meeting points on a city map. If you plan to get the last shuttle from town then get a card from the driver, which guarantees your place on the shuttle. If you do need to get a taxi then it roughly 10 Euros to the Vatican during the day, to the airport it\u2019s about 50 Euros. The hotel does run a shuttle to and from the airport at scheduled times at a cost of 12 Euros per person.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGreat base for exploring Rome away from the bustle of the city centre\u201d", "Author": "JohnK_8", "ReviewID": "UR117914169", "Content": "This hotel is handily placed for visiting the centre of Rome, either by shuttle bus or taxi.

I contacted the group directly and the final response i have had from them is the hotel says there is no evidence of theft but i can keep the 25,000 points.

We used the hotel's free shuttle bus a few times which is very useful for getting into Rome for the evening. The only drawback was the last return time was 9.15pm which was too early.

We used the shuttle bus from the hotel to the airport (12 euro each) but I was a bit concerned about the airport to the hotel as the times were restricted so got a taxi instead rather than fight our way through Rome with suitcases. We did a lot of the normal tourist trips, St Peters - including the trip to the top of it which is well worth the. We also went to the catacombs which was very interesting and well worth a trip - (get the metro to to St Giovanni and then the 218 bus to Via Appia - St calixta catacombs were just off Via Appia only 8 euro for adults.

Booked & paid in advance for 2 'Superior Rooms' at the Crowne Plaza Rome St. Peter's @ 240 Euros per room, per night. Ok lets start...... The hotel grounds/gardens are good, fresh and well manicured. However looking at the building as you arrive you get a sense of 1970 and if you like 1970 then this is the place for you. As you enter the main reception area the theme continues with dated reception area where there was around 10+ hotel patrons waiting patiently to speak to 2 hotel staff that were clearly under pressure. Once it was our turn to be served we went through the check in process quickly and efficiently. Armed with 2 x electronic keys for each room (magnetic barcode type you swipe) we got into a small and dated lift - hit the floor number and proceeded to our rooms. We successfully accessed one room but not the other as reception miscoded the access keys so we needed to go back down to reception and get the keys recoded. Entering the rooms I have to say I was completely underwhelmed. The bathroom was so small and so dated it wasn't funny. For example the chrome tap looked like its been there for 20 years, to be honest I have seen better in public toilets. The shower was a step in style over the bath complete with plastic shower curtain that is so close to your body it clings to you. The shower tap cover had broken/fallen off and was sitting at the bottom of the bath tub. The top of the vanity mirror was dusty and had/has cob webs. The sink is, well, small and congested with limited space for 2 cosmetic bags. Each of the 2 rooms housed 2 double beds that were comfortable, dressed with clean linen and 2 types of pillows that were firm and soft so you could chose what you liked. We also received some sprays for the pillows that provide for a restfull sleep which was nice. There was a work table that was so small you had to put the telephone on the floor so you could plug your laptop in. On the upside the internet connectivity is great with high speeds. Located on the wall was a small LCD television that delivers local TV and some English speaking channels. Be warned that if you want inhouse movies that will set you back 23 Euros but you'll be so bored at this place you'll gladly spend the 23 Euros to break the bleak monotomy of the hotel as there are no activities in this resort. The breakfasts are good with a decent buffet, lunch was OK but forget the dinner menu as it is so limited it's not funny that is unless you want to spend 35 Euro per person for the dinner buffet which is average at best. Keep you money and walk around the corner to the local restaurant which is cheaper, higher quality food with a far superior menu. Note that on Monday's the local restaurant is closed so you either go into the city to eat or stick with the hotel food. The swimming pool is 1st class, its large with shallow and deep ends and its long so you are able to swim to your hearts content. Once you have worked up an appetite or need a cold drink then there is a bar adjacent to the pool area but be warned, there are 2 guys staffing the bar that work in slow motion and I mean slow motion. For example we ordered a ham and cheese toasted sandwich, 2 wines, 1 beer and a coke and that took from start to finish 45 mins. The patrons were clearly getting frustrated as they waited to be served as was I. The bar inside the hotel operated efficiently at night and was accompanied with a pianist who was good. I could go on but really I have had enough. In summary, a dated hotel with below average rooms that aren't worth the money and a menu that sucks badly. For a Crowne Plaza Hotel, this one is bottom draw.

I usually only stay in the Holiday Inn chain which also includes Crowne Plaza and without sounding bombastic I am very well equiped to evaluate hotels. Since this was our first time in Rome, I searched many of the Holiday Inn hotels, Crowne Plaza's and Intercontinental Hotels within the confines of Rome. I wanted a good hotel inasmuch as I was also bringing along my boss...which adds a lot of tension in deciding on which hotel!!! I finally decided on the Crowne Plaza, Saint Peter's, which is just outside of the Vatican. It looked nice on their web site but I also knew that web sites can be misleading. I knew that our flight from the States would be early and all it took was one fax to the hotel to make sure our rooms were ready when we arrived....and they were even though we checked in before Noon. I was amazed at this hotel....the foyer was stunning, the rooms extra large, the internet workedlike a charm, they had a wonderful American style breakfast buffet, their outdoor pool, which you could easily see from the balcony in my room was spotless, the grounds were impeccable and I loved the amenities in the hotel so much (and I have so many I could probably open a store) that I asked for extra each day. When I entered my room there was a box of chocolates (nice touch) and two free bottles of water...another nice touch. Room Service was a tad pricey, but so was all of Rome with the dollar in comparison to the Euro! This hotel does offer a free shuttle to various but for me and my boss it was so much easier to grab a cab. Another nice service was that there are always cabs in a specific section just for the hotel guests. However, with all of that said, I judge a hotel by one major factor and that it the staff. If the staff is not good then for me the entire hotel is chalked off of my list for future trips. I have to be honest and say that this was the finest staff I have ever experienced. Regardless of my questions they were friendly, professional, remembered my name after I initially checked in and even the General Manager made it a point to introduce himself to me.....I have never seen a staff like this in the States....bravo to whomever trained this staff. Finally, after all is said and done and I was finished my daily business you will never know how wonderful it was to come back to the peace and quiet and beauty of this hotel, have a nice massage in their modern, underground (yes underground) spa and take a dip at night in their indoor poor.

Despite being a little further out of the centre we found this to be a bonus - a bit of peace and quiet after a hectic day in Rome was very much welcomed. The staff were very friendly and we couldn't fault much with the hotel. Transport We took the airport shuttle to the hotel which costs \u20ac12 each (cheaper than getting a taxi). The shuttle itself was great but the signpost to 'bus hotel' wasn't very clear. Come out of the arrivals hall, turn right and keep going right to the end - the Crowne Plaza bus is right at the far right. We took the hotel shuttle bus to and from the centre a few times which we found very convenient, especially as it was free! We had no problems getting onto the bus but we turned up early (10min ish). There is a public bus right outside the hotel, which we didn't use but looked very straight forward. We walked to the underground which was around 15min away and fine. On the walk up to the underground from the hotel we walked past a lovely modern restaurant which we tried and was very reasonable (and busy with local). Taxis aren't expensive either - about \u20ac10 to Vatican and \u20ac15 to the centre of Rome (even at night time). Hotel Spa This was lovely and great that its a children free zone - nice, quiet and relaxing after a busy day of sightseeing. Restaurants / bars We didn't eat in the hotel - to be honest the restaurant food looked rather bland. The hotel was really great and after 6.30pm they give free nibbles with drinks, a really nice touch. The bar had a nice atmosphere. The bar man on duty over the weekend (1st May) was great, unfortunately I didn't catch his name, but I would pick him out as particularly having good customer service. We ate in Arturo's next door to the hotel which was lovely and inexpensive. We walked up to La Nocetta but this wasn't open on the evening we chose. instead we walked up the road just out of the hotel to the right (up the hill where the bus goes), took a left and found a great modern restaurant on the right - v inexpensive (\u20ac40 for 2 incl starters, main and wine). There is also a McDonalds (we didn't eat here!). We also ate at Ristorante Il Chianti by Trevi Fountain which was really nice but a little more expensive than the other restaurants, but worth it. Rooms We got upgraded as I'm a priority club member which was fab. We had a room over looking the pool which I felt was one of the better locations. It had a good sized balcony and was well equipped - as you would expect from a Crowne Plaza. The only downside was the rooms are quite thin and we were a little disturbed by noisy neighboursa. Also when the main light switch was on there was an annoying buzzing noise.

But hotels in the center of Rome don't have all the amenties that you get at the Crowne Plaza, such as the pools, spa, restaurants, bar, etc. We stayed at a hotel near the Spanish Step and it had location, but none of the amenaties that we Americans expect. Also, they do have a courtesy shuttle that runs quite often to the center of Rome and Vatican City (the shuttle schedule can be downloaded from their web page). You can also take a bus (only 1 euro/pp) to the Metro that will drop you off in the center of the city (very easy and cheap!). Also it a short walk to the nearby Villa Doria Pamphilj - the biggest park in Rome (way bigger than Villa Borghese). It is a bit of a harrowing walk because there are no sidewalks on Via Aurelia Antica, but once you've walked around rome for a while you get used to the cars speeding by you.

To be honest I don't know if I misread the location, but I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't closer to the sights of Rome. We ended up spending a lot of money on cabs into and out of the city. The courtesy bus that took you back to the hotel at night from outside the 'polish church' should be in one of Dan Brown's books as a lost symbol as we could never find it! The bus only takes you to the Vatican in the morning and the main city in the afternnon, they are pretty far from each other which I didn't realise. Watch the taxi's at the vatican if you want to get over to the colesseum, they will rip you off, usual price around 14 euros. To get back to the hotel about the same. By the way when you step foot near the Colleseum, be aware you will get ambushed by men dressed as Gladiators who promptly ask to take your picture, well tell you they are taking your picture, then not too nicely demand 20 euros for the pleasure, do not engage them at all! You have been warned! Our room looked over the car park and main road. The balcony was pretty shabby and the room was quite small as well as not being very well sound proofed.

I expressly booked this hotel for the spa, but we spent so much time sight seeing we never used it, but it did look nice enough when we checked it out. The pool wasn't open til May which we didnt know. In the main restaurant, the Osteria, don't just think you are limited to the menu. We asked for whatever we fancied and the staff accommodated us to the best they could. We expect excellent food service and quality and this restaurant did not disappoint. Room service was a joke, 20 euros for a sandwich! All in all if you want to embrace a romantic stay with a glass of wine overlooking Rome's skyline this is not the hotel for you. For a place to get your head down and be out of the hustle and bustle, then its fine. Rome is extremely expensive, so be ready to fork out. Lunch with a bottle of wine near to the Vatican cost 120 Euros and we were not eating extravagantly at all. We stopped off for a coffee, two coffees, a bottle of water came to 20 euros!

The good points: The staff at the hotel were lovely and very efficient - faultless. The cab rank in the car park outside makes getting a cab very fast. The spa area (indoor pool, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi) was clean and well-run. Take your flipflops with you or you'll have to purchase some there. The rooms were a good size and well-equipped. The not so good points: The whole place had the feeling of trying to be somewhat grander but they'd missed the mark and just made it dark/gloomy instead. The first things you see when you arrive is a poorly maintained driveway and badly lit reception area. Easy to fix if they chose to do so. The location is outside the centre of Rome and this shouldn't be an issue with the use of the hotel's free shuttle bus. There's just one problem - the running times don't reflect your needs as a visitor: the shuttle starts at 9am, so you get to your starting point around 9.45/10am which is half the morning gone, especially if you're looking to get St Peters and the Vatican covered. The last shuttle back leaves town at 9.15pm, which is too early considering that most restaurants only open for dinner at 8pm. This means you're either looking at a 20 euro cab fare or 50 mins of metro then a bus. Transport suddenly becomes a bigger issue at the end of a great day of sight-seeing. The bathroom was clean generally but spoilt by small issues like dirty grouting and mouldy shower curtain. Food in the Osteria restaurant was just ok - the quality was just ok, the options were not particularly Italian and at 25 euros, it was frankly expensive for what it was. Noise was an issue on one night, soundproofing should be better between rooms. The hotel could be brighter and really superb. As it is, I'd say this was a 3 star with excellent potential.

As I didn't pay to stay here I am not going to be as critical as I would have been if I had paid 320 euros a night. The suite was nice and spacious and lovely beds. Bathrooms ok but not the nicest I have experienced. Hardly any English speaking TV channels not that you go on holiday to watch TV but it is nice to relax in front of after being out all day. View from Balcony wasn't that great as looked down into the back of the kitchens and store areas (probably because we weren't paying). The ' suite extras' weren't included such as the free mini bar, chocolates, movies etc. This wasn't mentioned on the website when we booked so we ended up getting to use the mini bar for free after a complaint to the manager as to be honest we would have taken a standard room in the Intercontinental in the centre of Rome. However I was impressed by the way Georgia on reception dealt with my complaint. We ordered room service on both nights as after a day walking in Rome we were too tired to go out. Food was good especially the cheese platter which my husband thoroughly enjoyed. I used the Spa once- wear down the slippers from the room or flipflops or they will charge you 5 euros for a pair of their flipflops. It wasn't the best or nicest spa I have been to and as previously mentioned no under 16 year olds allowed. As also suggested, it would be good if they allowed children in at set times mainly when the outdoor pool is closed in winter. It didn't bother us not being in the centre of Rome. On arrival we left our luggage at the Train Station (4 euros for 5 hours) to save us going all the way back to the hotel and coming back in (the day we arrived there was a public transport strike, we had planned to get the airport bus from Ciampino to the metro station and stay on till Cornelia and then walk to the hotel.) We used the hotel's shuttle bus to take us into the Vatican and then caught it back later on in the day from the centre. It didn't take that long to get into the centre from the hotel either on the metro or using the hotel's shuttle bus. On the whole we had a nice stay (being free made it that bit better!).

The hotel has a complimentary shuttle service from Hotel to Rome City and from Rome City back to the hotel. The bus is very comfortable, clean and air conditioning. The hotel has also an airport shuttle service which I will highly recommend to take. I did the mistake to get to the hotel on my own when I arrived in Rome and we had lots of problems on our way. we did not know if the hotel had a shuttle service from the airport but on our way back we use the shuttle service which cost 12 euros person. That is Hotel and straight to airport without any hassle to take the metro etc and metro will cost you more anyway. \u00a0 Bar: \u00a0 The bar lounge is very nice, modern and relaxing atmosphere and staff seem to be very knowledgeable and caring. The bar staff had a very positive CAN DO attitude. There is a pianist who plays in the bar lounge area every evening. \u00a0 Breakfast: \u00a0 It\u2019s a full English breakfast at 18 euros per person. Its really nice and you have lots to choose from. On the buffet they have only scramble eggs but you can also ask your waiter for either fried eggs or omelette. They also have sparkling wine included in the breakfast but we did not take any. \u00a0 Lunch: \u00a0 We were having lunch everyday in the city so cannot tell but I guess it must be good. \u00a0 Dinner: \u00a0 We ate in the buffet restaurant every night and it was delicious. Every night they had \u00a0different soups and the main course as well were a different one every night. The buffet is at 25 euros per person and its really worth the price. \u00a0 Room: \u00a0 Our room was on the 4th floor and was overlooking the car park. There was a spacious balcony and the room was always clean. The bed was massive and very comfortable. Unfortunately my girlfriend found the pillow to be too soft but I guess we could have asked for a different type of pillow. You have complimentary tea / coffee facilities in the room and also bottles of water which I found to be very convenient. There is a flat screen hanging on the wall and you get numerous channels for free including sky sports 1 and sky sports 2. \u00a0 Internet: \u00a0 Internet is chargeable but just to let you know that there is a computer next to the elevator on the ground floor with free internet access. so feel free to browse and reconfirm your \u00a0 On a special note I would like to thank (Mohammed or Ali). I am not sure of the name but he works at the reception at night. He was our first contact with the hotel staff and we met him about 20 minutes away from the hotel. It was on our arrival day and we were lost on our way to the hotel and thankfully we met on the road him as he was on his way to work. He was very nice and even help my partner with her bag. He has a great CAN DO ATTIUDE and for me he has done the extra mile. Thank you again for your help that night. \u00a0 Also, everyone I have interacted with at the reception and restaurant were very polite and professional. The hotel staff also speaks different languages. \u00a0 To conclude the Crown Plaza St Peters was one of the best hotel we ever stayed and will recommend to anyone.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCrowne-Plaza was fantastic!\u201d", "Author": "wilson_dina", "ReviewID": "UR100899205", "Content": "I travelled to Rome for the first time in March with 2 really good friends for my 40th Birthday.

We were part of a large group of Indians who had gone to participate in a seminar and also for sightseeing in Rome. The efficiency of the hotel was manifest right from the point of first contact when each one of us was handed over a room key immediately on entry, without having to wait for the formal paper work (which were not neglected either). We checked in on the forenoon of 16th February and stayed on till the morning of 20th February , though some of us left a day earlier.There was all round satisfaction about services of the hotel. The concierge especially was very helpful in guiding us about various matters , whenever we contacted. We stayed in Room # 232 , a delightful room with a wonderful view of the hotel's garden area.Temperature outside was freezing to the unaccustomed Indian skin but the hotel's central heating system kept the interiors warm and comfortable. We had a conference in the same hotel. The venue was 'Constantino' ; a meeting hall below the lobby level which was well furnished and decent. Food was very good and breakfast spead was generous everyday. Even the best of facilities come with some aberrations and Crowne Plaza was no exception.Here is a list of some things which were not right. One of our colleagues said he lost some cash in the room . We had our own doubts about this and thought he would have lost it somewhere outside but not in hotel room. He insisted it was in the room.The hotel ofcourse had provided safe deposit lockers in every room which worked fine.But loss of cash (or anything for that matter) inside the hotel room ; even if it was kept somewhere outside the locker ,is a bad thing , if it actually happened. The lifts were only at oneside of the long corridor. Guests staying in rooms on the extreme other side (# 201 , 202 etc.) had to walk quite a distance to reach the lifts. Power went off in our room (and some other rooms on second floor) for sometime one morning. Whenever such a thing happens in any hotel , the supply is restored within seconds from an alternate source. Not here. We were without power for about ten minutes.

Otherwise, it is OK. The staff at the reception is friendly, as are the maids. The room is spacious, the bed and the pillows are perfect. Cleanliness is pretty good. The bathroom is a bit outdated, as is the room interior. They need redesigning. There was a big terrace in my room, which was nice to sit and rest. The TV has a medium-quality selection of programmes, and if you want to watch a blockbuster movie, you have to pay way too much for that (some 23 EUR). The TV is flat-screen, but relatively small. The heater in the room can be used for heating in the evening, during the night and in the morning, but it blows cold air during the day. In the closet is an iron and ironing board, which I find very practical, and was a pleasant surprise. The breakfast was pretty good, served from 6:== AM to 11:00AM, and on weekends till 11:30AM. I find this excellent, because I enjoy a very early breakfast, and this is a rarity in hotels, usually in other places it is served at 7 or 7:30AM till 10:00AM, so this i a big plus for this hotel. The location is partly compensated by a courtesy hotel bus to the center of the town which drives you from 8:00 til the noon, every hour, to and from Vatican, and from 4:00PM to 9:00PM to and from the city center (via delle boteghe oscure No 16). This is a great way to go to the city without additional expences for the taxi service. There is also a bus to Fiumicino airport, but only once daily, leaves at 7:15AM every day. If this is not a good time for you to go t the airport, you can use an official taxi (the white car) and get to the airport ifor 40EUR. When you get to the airport and want to get to this hotel, use only the white taxies, and agree on the price in advence (also possible for 40EUR), because some other driver-services can take you 70-110EUR, and even more.

The patio door did not lock and was left open by the cleaner on our 2nd day!! The indoor pool is NOT open to children (our children were very upset) and we met 3 other families trying to get in with there children at the same time-the outdoor pool was shut (i do have to add that we had a message the second day saying our children could use the pool between 4pm and 6pm on that day-we got back to the hotel at 9pm!! The courtesy bus get very busy so make sure you are outside at least 20 mins before-we were asked by the driver to take our childrens (age 4 and 7) seat belts off and sit them on our laps-I dont think so!!

The Crowne Plaza certainly made me feel special with a surprise delivery of champagne (compliments of the general manager) on my actual birthday, lovely. The hotel itself is a little out of Rome but about 10mins walk to Cornelia train station. The trains are really user friendly and very cheap making Rome easily accessible. the buses also stop immediately outside. Crowne Plaza, St Peters is extremely well kept and very clean. Our room was large and quiet. the hotel as a great pool and fitness faciliites, two good restaurants and a sociable bar in the front entrance. The staff went out of their way to be helpful and friendly. I would really recommend it as a great place to stay in Rome. Some general tips for Rome. Take the tour at The Vatican museum and the Sistine Chapel its about 20-25 euro's each plus the entrance fee of 15euros's. If you can book online before you get there as it saves you have to queue. Do the tour of the Coloseum and Palantine Hill, its amazing and the guides really bring it to life - we picked up a tour when we got off the tube, which was easy and well worth doing. Pre-book Villa Borghese, before you arrive - truly beautiful. Visit the Pantheon, we didn't need a guide it was self explanitory. Eat at The Royal restaurant opposite the Coloseum, good food, reasonably priced. Eat at Gianni's restaurant if you can find it, near the rive, great traditional pasta. Eat ice-cream near the exit to the Sistine Chapel, it's 5euro's each but absolutely enormous and delicious. Take an umbrella.

Every effort was made to get the extra guests into Rome each morning if the 1st coach was full.

Rooms very comfortable, beds amazing. One thing worth considering if you visit in August - the floor-standing air conditioning units seemed old and not really up to the job! We were lucky that the week we were there, towards the end of August, was not unbearably hot, but we still ended up having to leave the balcony door open each night, to keep the room tolerable. We were at the front of the hotel (North West facing) and the room was just far enough back from the road not to be too aware of the traffic but we could still catch it in the bachground. The back of the hotel - the rooms facing the pool in their main picture, would have been a lot quieter, but as they faced East/South and got the sun all day they would have been impossible to cool down, even at night, so we opted not to change rooms. Breakfast selection quite good, pity the coffee was always cold. We eventually found the self service coffee machine tucked away in the dining room, which dispersed hot coffee, so problem solved. They ran out of the most popular breakfast rolls very early on (each day) and had none left to replenish the baskets. Breakfast room seemed a bit understaffed for August and tables took ages to clear at peak times. All in all, we welcomed the chance to get out of Rome each evening after a day sightseeing and to have a cool drink on the balcony at sunset.

Having booked our week long stay through the company website I'd choicen the family rate, which included Bed and breakfast, free kids meals from the childrens menu, internet access and pay tv). On arriving at the hotel prior to usual check-in we were offered a good clean room on the front of the hotel. After a few days in the heat (30-34C) it was definitely a benefit having the cool morning balcony. I would agree that the bathrooms are small but clean and functional. We avoided using the TV to begin with but the latest kids movies available they were great for a few hours when too hot outside. The restaurant food was of good standard and the buffet offered good value with a wide selection of italian and roman dishes which was complemented by a themed menu Wed-Sat one week a month. Tex Mex in our case, included an enormous T Bone which another couple were enjoying. My only concern was the kids menu was a bit limited for a full week. (Just a quick note on eating in central Rome, the quality did vary and most cases the better restaurants are actually more expensive than the hotel but the pizzerias are good value. Always check your bill as I found the wrong value for a dish was quoted and inflated the price, maybe an accident once but twice was a bit odd. Queried and resolved immediately both times with apologises). If you don't like cats/birds eat inside, as the local felines or pigeons are looking for scraps. The Breakfast buffet service was well managed and provided a good spread catering for all tastes, american and continental. We did find some problem with getting hot water for tea on a couple of occasions, just ask again. Obviously the hotel is not in the centre but its not far away. The free hotel coach(es) were first come first served, running regularly in the morning and evening. I didn't actually see anyone miss out though as if demand increased they had a couple of coaches. There was a bus service at the entrance to the hotel with the metro not far but we didn't need to use them. (note though that metro is 1 euro each, <10 yrs are free). Taxis back from the centre were only 12-14 euros and not as bad as expected from comments I had read. The outside pool was great and surprisingly deep, 6ft to 12ft. The seperate childrens pool was also clean, with water temperatures a refreshing break from the heat. We didn't use the spa so can't comment. On our last day the 1960 italian olympic team were having their 50th anniversary reunion in the hotel. The gold medal water polo team posed for a film crew. In most cases the staff were good speakers of English and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. Finally the taxis to and from the airport were both reasonably priced as there is a fixed city rate of 40 euro currently. There were 4 pcs which could be used in the lobby if internet access was needed at an extra cost but I did notice that some of the machines were not disconnected from customers using them, so be careful about accessing your secure accounts unless you log off probably. I didn't try using a laptop but similar to the paytv access they might be a bit slow. As a whole I thought the hotel was good value for money but the one expensive item seemed to be the soft drinks, compared to local shop prices they were 4 times the price. Obviously this isn't any different from a hotel in the UK but something to look out for, personally if hotels didn't try to rake margins on these areas they would have less people staying in their rooms after purchasing from the supermarket and increasing there income in the restaurant.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "N.I.", "Title": "\u201cAt a distance\u201d", "Author": "fufty", "ReviewID": "UR76915274", "Content": "After 3 nights at The Colonna Palace in central Rome ( see separate review ) we moved here for 4 nts, as we were trying to accomodate our 18 yr old son who was seeing Rome for the first time, and felt he would be ready to leave the city centre and chill by the pool.

The staff spoke English and were, at least most of them, very helpful. When we checked in, we were offered a \"pay in advance breakfast\" option, which we refused, since we wanted to venture out and try local breakfast fare. That quickly proved to be a mistake.

Our young kids, used to a bigger, American-style breakfast, felt sick after eating that much sugar first thing in the morning. We wen back to the hotel and asked if we could still buy the breakfast option and they accommodated us. VERY expensive, but also very good. The bad: The worst internet service I have experienced in any hotel in the last 10 years. Not kidding. In the last 10 years. Bad services 10 years ago were still better than this. If you plan on using the service to do anything other than checking your text emails, forget about it. We had about 100 pics we wanted to upload to share with family. It took.... 43 hours to get it done!!!! Two days. the hotel is far from everything. Sure you can walk to a subway station. Not close, but you can walk. However, that is a treacherous walk. There is no real sidewalk, and you'd be walking extremely close to one of the most dangerous traffic on Earth. We tried a couple of times only to almost be decapitated by a scooter's rear view mirror. Not worth taking the risk. The hotel, apparently, understands that and provides a regularly scheduled shuttle that takes you downtown, and also picks you up. If you don't mind being on their schedule, it is a fantastic service. If you want to be in the middle of it all, you should probably consider a different hotel.

I stayed here with two young children. We had a double room for four. The bedroom was of average size. The beds were extremely comfortable. However, the bathroom was far too small. When you took a shower the sink ended up wet and the sink was placed almost on top of the toilet. There was no room to move. There was no extractor fan so the bathroom was full of steam. There was mould in the corners of the bath and the shower head looked like it had never been cleaned. The shuttle runs from about 9am 'till midday to the Vatican City. From 4pm 'till 9pm the shuttle runs between Rome centre. Be warned though, places on the shuttle are not guaranteed. It is not first come first on but those who push to front get a seat. If you don't get a seat then you are left to wait for next shuttle - or you can get a taxi for about 10 euros. The breakfast was fine, it wasn't the best but it wasn't too bad either. The staff however were not friendly. Tea and coffee were not offered to you at the table which I would have expected for a hotel of this rating. When I asked for a pot of hot water for tea the waitress on duty was clearly put out and the hot milk never arrived. The night before we were due to leave I asked the concierge to book a taxi. She quoted 75 euros. This was more than the company I had used when we arrived in Rome. When i questioned the quote she said this was the only company that she knew of in Rome that did airport shuttles. I asked her to contact RomeCabs.com for me. She refused and said that I must call them myself from my room. I decided to get a local taxi from the taxi stand in the morning instead. This only cost 36 euros for six of us. The chap at the front of the hotel was great. One night I ordered room service for the kids. A margarita and fries cost 20 euros. The pizza was poor considering this is an Italian dish. The restaurants around the hotel were better and the bars at the top of the road far cheaper than the hotel. On the plus side, the hotel was cheap compared to those in the centre of Rome.

The outdoor pool wasn't open yet. the breakfast was pricey, but very good, and my girls loved it. the internet expense was high, but sometimes you can grab a lobby computer with time left on it. the only dinner restaurant lacks the Rome feel, and isn't family oriented, but the concierge offers a courtesy taxi to a neighborhood restaurant. It was great! Arturo's next door is also wonderful, but it is closed on Mondays. If you take the Metro, ask for specific instructions on which direction, and what exit to walk out of, otherwise you can be disoriented for a while (or lost like us). Overall, we were content, and while some things disappointed us, we were glad to be in a spacious, comfortable room in a quiet area. Also, while there is a courtesy taxi to and from the airport, it is only once a day. You can arrange through the hotel, for a private car to pick you up. It is however, expensive. Take smaller luggage to avoid the Minivan expense. The alternative is public transit, which is not a nice way to begin your vacation!", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth", "Title": "\u201cA great hotel and great staff....\u201d", "Author": "rocketpants", "ReviewID": "UR60539045", "Content": "Just to say a big thumbs up to the staff at this hotel, nothing was too much trouble and the quality of the hotel itself was superb.

The indoor swimming pool and jacuzzi are a very good solution for you when you want to relax after a full touristic day and are totally well-preserved although the depth is disappointingly too small(only 1,2m,so I wonder why children must be at least 16 in order to use this pool!)...Anyway,be ready to make a real healthy circuit with roman bath and sauna if you want !

The room was big, well-furnished, and pretty typical of a Crowne Plaza everywhere -- they won't knock your socks off with their splendor, but they're nice enough. Over all, I liked the place.

The room was clean, had a nice balcony overlooking the tennis court. It was hot at night when they cut the air conditioning off. Had no trouble getting wake up calls or towels. The front desk staff, for the most part, were rude. Once I came to the desk to ask a question about the bus and the staff person was talking to someone else so I waited my turn. when he finished he just completely ignored me! Other staff were milling around and no one said \"may I help you?\" I finally raised my voice and got their attention. There were similar incidents like that. I don't know if they are sexist or racist or just RUDE!!! The night staff was a little better except for the tall, thin grumpy one. Ugh!!! The piano bar in the lobby was a nice place to go for drinks in the evening. Fabio, the bartender, is very nice as is the piano player. I enjoyed evenings there and they stay open until 1:30 a.m. We never had a problem with the shuttle. You cannot get it from 12:00-3:00 because of lunch. It was never overcrowded. We took the bus into the subway stop much of the time because it was so convenient.. You could walk there (in terms of distance) but the narrow streets with no sidewalks makes it prohibitive. Don't try it! The bus service is iffy after 10:30 p.m. and one night we had to get a taxi. The driver took us back to the Vatican and all around, pretending he didn't know where we wanted to go and when I became extremely agitated he took us to the hotel, mumbling about how he has a family to support. I did not pay what he asked and got out. I peobably shouldn't have paid what I did pay. Look out for that kind of thing but it really doesn't happen much. I went to the breakfast buffet once-18 euros for waht is essentially a continental breakfast with some sausage (ugh) and runny eggs. The fruit and juice (and champagne) were great. The staff is good about helping to arrange tours and we took one to Capri that was excellent. You can get to Florence by just taking the metro to the Termini and buying a ticket , then just hop on one of those stop and go sightseeing buses that comes outside of the Florence station and you're good to go. All in all I liked the hotel but would probably stay closer in town next time. It was quiet at night. Each morning at 7:00 a.m. the church bells would chime then play Ave Maria. It was a nice touch. The restaurant next door is pretty nice. Great seabass! They are very friendly and accommodating. We never used the pool or spa.

The shuttle however runs every hour but it is not always on time so you find yourself sometimes waiting up to 45 minutes just to catch a ride back to the hotel. Oh, and if you are not an early bird, you can also find yourself without a seat on the bus as there is only one bus and too many guests. You cannot walk to any place from this hotel and there is only one restaurant (and not a good one) nearby. Do not listen to all the reviews here about great staff service either. They were simply non-responsive. Simple requests for ice and towels went unanswered; wake up calls were never made. Requests for recommendations for nearby restaurants and/or transportation were met with a shrugging of shoulders followed by a pursing of the lips. No answer; no service.

The room we were allocated was spacious, well furnished, light and airy and easily large enough to accommodate all four of us. The range of kids movies on the reasonably priced pay TV was super and kept my girls occupied nicely whilst the midday sun burned at its most ferocious outside. We ate dinner on one night in the open area restaurant to the front of the hotel and we were pleasantly surprised by the menu and quality of both food and service. Some Roman cousins of mine came to dinner and they too remarked just how good the food was! The choice and quality of children\u2019s food was exceptional as evidenced by my youngest devouring her meal in record time .... something she does very rarely. The activity menu\u2019s for children are another nice touch helping us keep the children occupied during the very short time between ordering and receiving your food.

This information shocked us to say the least, and we were very confused by the cancellation of our booking, which was made through an agent called BOOK IN HOTELS.COM - DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! I had made contact with the Crowne Plaza several times over the week preceding our visit and was not informed by either the Crowne Plaza or our booking agent that our stay had been cancelled, despite having obviously paid up front. I asked the receptionist Connie what the Crowne Plaza could do to assist us with this worse case scenario of no hotel room, and they offered to contact the booking agent on our behalf but infortunately the call went unanswered. After this relatively mediocre attempt at assistance, it was obvious that we were becoming a nuisance and the receptionists were no longer interested in our plight. We were met with blank looks and shrugged shoulders, with the continuing offer of a special rate of 700 Euros for the 4 night stay, after already paying up front for our room.. We asked whether they could assist in finding us another room elsewhere as this was more than we wanted to pay, and were told all other hotels were fully booked (along with the Crowne Plaza) but we could have free use of the internet for 1 hour if we wanted to look for ourselves! I am aware that the cancellation of our booking was not the fault of the Crowne Plaza, however their response and attempt at \"Customer Service\" was appalling. They were simply not interested and we were made to feel like criminals as if we were trying to pull a fast one. The hotel could have at least informed us prior to our arrival that our booking had been cancelled and have been more understanding instead of at one point refusing to speak with us when we did not give in and go away, like it was clear they would have preferred. All in all, we had a pleasant stay but i would not stay at this hotel again or recommend to anyone who appreciates friendly customer service. The bar downstairs is the most boring bar i've ever experienced which is clearly why no one else visited it. Plinky plonky piano and hugely expensive drinks - not great! Previous people have recommended the restaurants nearby - i'd give these a miss - not very impressive, no atmosphere etc. Take a taxi to Trastevere instead, it's about 8 Euros and there are hundreds of restaurants and bars by the river, loads of atmosphere and hustle and bustle - proper Rome. The pool at the hotel was nice and there was always a spare sunbed which is surprising considering the amount of rooms. Breakfast - the good would be choice of toast, cereals, plenty of fruit, juices etc The bad would be the \"hot\" buffet - the sausages were about 2 inches long, the bacon was rubbery, the eggs were slushy and undercooked and all of the above were cold. I was told by email from the hotel that breakfast would be 18 Euros per day however when i was there i saw several advertisements stating that breakfast was 14 Euros. In a nutshell, if you're going to stay here, double check and check again that your room is really available and skip the hotel bar, hot buffet breakfast and nearby restaurants and try out the pool.

If you book an 'american' breakfast the day/night before, you get a voucher that gives 4 Euro's off the price. The bar prices were on a par with the prices of drinks in the centre of Rome. The hotel operates a shuttle into the centre of Rome, almost on an hourly basis, which is free and very convenient and holds 35 people. Get to the stop about 10 minutes early and be prepared to battle to get on it - other tourists have no manners, and if you don't have a 'if you can't beat em - join em' attitude you won't get a seat! There is a bus stop outside the hotel that takes you to the Vatican (But not on a Sunday!) and you can buy bus tickets from the Hotel (One Euro each for 75 minutes of travel!). You can also get a taxi easily as there is a taxi rank at the hotel. For a big hotel it was exceptionally quiet! There is also a spa and swimming pool but we were too busy in Rome and didn't have time to use them!

Took the express train from the airport to Termini station and then took a taxi to the hotel which came to 17 Euros on the meter (I suspect it would have been less, but there's a lot of traffic in the city centre on Friday nights). I offered the driver 20 Euros but as he had no change he was willing to charge me 15 which was a nice surprise, however I told him he could keep the change as a tip. Check-in painless, no one else waiting to check-in and friendly person at the desk, without prompting, he said he'd see if there were any upgrades available for me as a platinum member. I was given a slightly bigger room with a pool view. The hotel was refurbished in 2008 and the hotel has won awards for its refurbishment. This means the rooms are clean, comfortable and modern but are not as stylish as the Crowne Plaza London Kensington that was refurbished this year. The hotel is not within reasonable walking distance of the city centre, but you have a few options. The hotel runs a complimentary shuttle bus most hours, there's also a taxi rank inside the hotel grounds or the hotel can also advise on public transport (and sell tickets). The bus ride to the centre is less than 15 minutes. I only visited the city centre once in this trip (because I've visited Rome a number of times previously, staying at the InterContinental which is very centrally located). I decided to use this trip for relaxation rather than sightseeing and take advantage of the hotels facilities, particularly the pool area. The hotel has a very nice bar terrace and a reasonable (although not outstanding) restaurant. However, there's a very nice Italian restaurant located right next to the hotel, just outside the grounds. It's frequented by the locals and hotel guests in the know. It's well worth a visit. Overall, very pleased with my stay. I wanted a nice relaxing weekend and that's what I got. If you just want a city break, I'd consider something more central. But if you'd like to spend some time relaxing by the pool in addition to seeing the sights then you can't go wrong. Lessons to be learned: I should have taken a taxi direct from the airport to the hotel, this would have cost me 40 euros. This was more expensive than the combined train + taxi option but the direct taxi would have avoided Rome's Friday night traffic congestion. The cheapest option to the hotel is a combination of train + metro + bus (or 10 minute walk instead of the bus). You can find public transport info on the hotels website or if you need further assistance then contact them before arrival. The hotels free shuttle bus only makes one trip to the airport, mainly to cater for the morning arrivals from the USA. During the rest of the day the shuttle bus is used between the hotel and the city centre.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cheshire", "Title": "\u201cExceeded Expectations\u201d", "Author": "vinceheath", "ReviewID": "UR34343695", "Content": "We arrived early at the hotel and as our room was not ready was directed to the pool area which made a great start to our 3 day trip.

My husband and I had the wonderful experience of being guests at the Crowne Plaza Rome-St. Peter's for two evenings this May. From the moment we walked into the lobby; we knew we had made the correct choice in a hotel. Besides having an immaculately clean, spacious, tastefully appointed and comfortable room -- the grounds are just beautiful groomed. The staff was helpful and eager to suggest places of interest and things to do while in Rome. The hotel provides a free shuttle service that runs back and forth to town several times a day. What we saved in taxi fares we able to to extend as a tip to the shuttle driver, who was genuinely appreciative to receive. ( We have found in past at other hotels; drivers acted as if they hated people -- they could not smile or speak to the guests.) Not that way at the Crowne Plaza ! As for Front Office staff - they are just the best. I want to especially make mention of Simonetta Bogudi. This woman is amazing, when I first met her -- she had been busy filling guests requests and reservations. When it was my turn --- she greeted me in a very professional and kind manner. Which would be difficult for many other hotel front staff -- the three guests before me in line were rude and very demanding. She did not let them affect her -- you would have thought I was her first guest that day. She was so calm and greeted me with kindess and respect. The Crowne Plaza will be our only choice hotel in the future; and meeting Simonetta played a hugh factor in that decision. We were so impressed that we will be returning for five evenings this month; and back again mid November for about week. Everyone was so kind, we are looking forward to our next stay. The Crowne Plaza will have our business forever !! We have recommended your hotel to others and a couple we told about you just ended a weekend stay on May 22.

I have just re-read the reviews and I can only conclude that either it is a different hotel or some people are easily pleased. This hotel is a tired, depressing, unlovely piece of 70s architecture with a colour scheme, particularly in the hotel lobbies, that could induce a migraine in sensitive souls, but let's not be too petty and instead, look at the location. One reviewer says it is in the centre of Rome and another says that it is a short stroll to St Peter's; it is in fact 5 and 3 kilometres respectively. The anonymous location is served by a busy and, being Rome, fast urban roadway whose pavements disappear, leaving the pedestrian horrible exposed to Italian driving skills. Anyone with the faintest suicidal notions should avoid the pedestrian option. It is therefore, not surprising that the little shuttle bus was so poular. This runs about every hour to and fro until 10.15pm with a 4 hour break midday. so what's wrong with that I hear you ask; well the combination of a large remotish hotel and a small bus means. as the hotel sign says, first come, first serve, everybody else is left standing on the pavement to wait a further hour or take a 16-17 Euro taxi trip into the centre. Inside, atrocious corridor decor apart, the hotel is generally quite gloomy, with little natural daylight, although the litlle conservatory was quite pleasant. Bedrooms are a decent size and the bed was comfortable and clean, but that smell, a sweet rancid smell reminiscent of putrifaction. Hot water too, was interesting; shower during the day, as most people don't, and you would be rewarded with hot water; shower first thing in the morning and it became an optional extra. The cost of the bedroom and bevarages was steep, but that appears to be Rome for you - no such thing as a credit crunch here, yet. On the plus side the staff were efficient and friendly, but they'd need to be keep this leaky old vessel afloat. In summation, this is a tired hotel, very much aimed at the business sector and tour bus operators, badly in need of renovation and, as an architect, I would be more than happy to help, that way I might find out the cause of that smell.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cWill return anytime!!!!\u201d", "Author": "pipesaldarriaga", "ReviewID": "UR27349211", "Content": "Me and my wife recently had the pleasure of staying at this hotel.

The Hotel does have a shuttle bus, but it only operates 1 time per day. It leaves the hotel at 7:15 am and returns from the Airport at 8 am. Thats it!

Concur with most other reviews with following updates. Yes, hotel is near nothing (St. Peter's Basilica in not within walking distance), but free shuttle bus is pretty good deal. However - the bus holds 33 and is first come first served. Being near the front of the line means little - doors open and its every man for himself. We were three for three, but saw about four or five turned away each day when no seats were left (no standing allowed). Bus departs at 8:45, 10:15, 11:30, 3:00, 4:15, 5:30, 7:45, 9:00, and 10:00. Returns from downtown are 9:15, 10:35, 11:50, 3:15, 4:30, 5:45, 8:10, 9:15, and 10:15. Downtown drop is at Via delie Botteghe Oscure 23, in front of Museum Nazionale Romano Crypt Balbi, a few blocks from Piazza Campidogglio, and a 10 minute walk to the Pantheon in another. We also took the number 881 or 98 bus from directly in front of the hotel to the Cornelia metro, and trained it in from there very easily. Cost is 1 Euro for the bus/train combo for up to 75 minutes. Walked to the metro once (20+ minutes) and to several local restaurants. I don't recommend it with small children - other reviewers were correct that there are small to no sidewalks in most directions from the hotel and I kept nervous watch on my 10 year old as buses and cars whizzed by. We ate at three restaurants near the hotel and enjoyed them all; Arturo's right at the hotel driveway, Birbante, about 10 minutes walk at Via di Bravetta 8/10 [--], and our favorite, a family run place about five minutes beyond Birbante, called al Giardino d'Abruzzo, Via Del Fontanile Arenato 77 ([--]. Dinner for two adults and a child, with a bottle of wine, appetizers, and desserts, ran about 50 EUR at each place. Our rate at the hotel included full breakfast. Decent spread - no omellete chef. Eggs alternated hard or runny. Little bit of everything and no one should go hungry. My standard coke with breakfast was extra - EUR 6.50 one day and EUR 4 the next. I brought my own the next two days and no one complained. Had to bring them from a grocer though. Hotel will sell tokens at the front desk for the one or two coke machines on every floor, and I hit them all only to find that none of them worked. The hotel staff was concerned not at all, and refunded my money but took no action over four days to restock the machines. Room was hot - thermostat and fan blew out hot air at a constant rate only. Desk's recommendation was to open the balcony door to mitigate heat, which we did. Room was otherwise fine (mini-bar, hot water pot and instant coffee, no microwave). Was supposed to get a daily paper as a Priority Club member but that never happened. Late check out of 2pm though worked fine.

Italy. Excellent hotel as far as cleanliness, size of room, amenities, bathroom, etc. However, as many other reviewers have said, it was not an easy walk to sights. We thought we could walk to the Castle St. Angelo, but didn't get far and realized we were uncomfortable on the tiny sidewalk/pathway vs. close-to-us traffic. We know they had a free shuttle to the town centre, but it did not drop people close to our destination. We would have ventured out, but had dinner appointment time with the tour, so not enough time when we didn't know where we were going or how much time was needed. When we left on our tour bus for dinner, we saw how far it was to the Castle and realized we could never have walked it.....not only the distance, but the way to get there. However, another couple of the tour took the free shuttle into Rome and said it was a 20 min. walk from there to the Castle, so if we had another day in Rome, we would have done so. This is a perfect hotel for a stopover or a \"just staying for the night til our tour leaves.\" We would have liked to stayed another day, as we would have taken advantage of the free shuttle and gone into the historic area. We would opt for this very good hotel, with large room at that location, vs. staying close to sights and not having such a good room and amenities, especially since the hotel offered free shuttle into historic area.

There is a safe that is probably big enough to put most laptops in. There's also a tea kettle with tea and coffee available.

The prices at the pool were ridicolous 8euros for a coke and a water which would be appropriate if you were at a 5star hotel in Rome overlooking the vatican but this was an out of town hotel with rather shabby halls as they were decorating and I herd lots of guests complaining of overpriced restaraunt with terrible food so we gave the restaraunt a miss. We did have room service one night of a club sandwich which was ok but you cant really go wrong with a club sandwich.

However, they have a large shuttle bus now that travels fairly frequently in to the centre and it works well. We stayed for 2 nights at the end of July as a family with 2 rooms which were superb. The front desk staff were amongst the best I have come across anywhere in the world. Overall, I would recommend this hotel providing you don't mind being a little out of the centre. You can also catch the metro but think it is a bit of a walk to/from the station. The Metro is really easy to use in Rome - buy your tickets at a newspaper stand near or at the station - a one way ticket costs 1 euro. Good value and efficient. We caught a taxi from St Peter's Square back to the hotel (the hotel shuttle bus doesn't go there - it goes past it but doesn't drop off) on one occasion and it cost about 13 euros - to give you an idea. The hotel was let down by their restaurant. We had lunch on arrival. Service was slow. There is one guy who swans around as if he owns the place (maybe he does!) He fronts it but that's the extent of his role. Then there was another guy behing a podium at the entrance. He didn't seem to do much either. Another supervisor type seemed to be adding the same amount of value and then there were the waitresses doing all the work - not many of them either. A waitress with an Italian/USA accent rescued the waitressing situation and seemed to be carrying the whole place - until she went off shift! The front man, podium man and superviser type could improve the efficiency of this restaurant no end if they would only work flexibly! The food was okay and not too expensive given the class of the hotel. But, don't let this put you off. There are 3 restaurants close by and they are much cheaper than those you find in the centre of the city. There is one right next door to the hotel - down the drive turn right. Others have commented how good this is. However, the owner sadly died the day before we arrived so it was closed while we were there. There are 2 other restaurants also close by but about a 5-8 minute walk. They are Birbante - turn left out of the hotel and walk along to the junction about 500 metres away and turn left. It is then in front of you on the right. The pavement towards the junction is narrow (single file only) so be careful and especially when crossing the road to the restaurant. The hotel will book you a table. Others have commented here with not very favourable remarks but we thought it was okay. A third one just a bit further on is the Giardino D'Abruzzo. Hotel will also book you a table here. This seemed to be full of locals. Service was a bit slow but it was okay too. So, you have a choice of 3 restaurants within easy reach - but don't get stressed out by the service - you have to get used to it in Italy in most places. The hotel has a great outdoor pool too.

Went to our room which was the second one next to the elevator, facing the pool and guess what an adjoining room. We swiftly got moved to the front of the hotel which was quite and had a larger room. The room was 424. The rooms are fine nothing amazing the beds are very comfy for Italy and we were happy and therefore settled in. We were annoyed to find that after 9pm the buffet bar was closed and in order for me to get a beef burger we had no other choice but to order room service.

Well the coke machine swallowed my token i had to get from the cashiers desk so i had to get a new one from them, they said if it has red lights on next to your choice it means its empty, so does that mean it its empty half the time. On our second night we had to order room service again and ordered The large mixed meat dish at \u20ac25 they said it would come in 20mins after several calls it came in 1hour and 10minutes time. It was cold so i sent it back and got a new one, now please don\u2019t think what i am about to say is exaggerated never in my life have i had a meal drenched in so much oil it was rotten, you know what i left 70% of it in the hall it was rotten. I have to say though the burgers are really nice so 10/10. Anyway check your bill as they charged us twice for a meal we already paid for in cash to the room service man. Internet is \u20ac5 for hour and it cant be used again so if you check an email its costing you \u20ac5.

There was a small balcony - great for early morning coffee. Air conditioning was generally good (but would have been nice if it went slightly cooler, since there was a heatwave when I was there - mid-30s every day). Ice machines were available on every floor. The maids always prepared the room very well each day and there were no problems getting extra bottles of water or towels from them at any time. The pool area was large and very clean with a lifeguard always present to help out with things like sun loungers and moving parasols around. Kids were allowed into the pool (some have reported that under-16s not allowed - not true). (I did not use the indoor pool so can't comment on that). The staff were very courteous and helpful (and patient with some of the tourists who asked some incredibly dumb questions in my opinion). There were some good floodlit tennis courts as well. The hotel is on a busy road (but set back in its own gardens) and there was a restaurant (Arturo's) next door with some shops about 1/2 mile to the left (cross the road near the restaurant for these as the path by the hotel is quite narrow and Italian drivers are a little mad). A shuttle bus (free) made the 15 min trip into the centre of Rome and back again about 6 times a day (last trip back from Rome was at 10:15pm). The bus was always on time and was an excellent service in general. Costs for drinks etc... were expensive - in keeping with Rome in general. The weak exchange rate made this seem even worse - so I purchased wine and beer from nearby shops and kept these in the fridge - problem solved.

However, as we were attempting to go for a dip we were quite abruptly told that the pool is for over 16's only. There are no other facilities available to amuse younger children so were left to spend the evenings in our room. Added to the fact that the hotel is on a busy road with no footpaths and little lighting then even short walks from the hotel with children are quite dangerous. On the night we arrived we asked the concierge to recommend a nearby restaurant as having looked at the menu for the hotel restaurant we discovered very high prices. He directed us to one a few hundred yards away down an extremely busy and poorly lt road called Bribante - the food and service here was very poor. The next night, by chance, we discovered Arturos which was next door to the hotel, filled with local families (always a good sign) and was a much better restaurant indeed - we wondered why the concierge had directed us further away to an obviously worse restaurant. Perhaps Arturos provides some competition to the Crowne Plazas own restaurant. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone travelling with a family - try to find one nearer the city centre - even if there are less facilities at least you'll be able to leave to find something to do.", "Date": "April 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cWe have no complaints\u201d", "Author": "davidrc517", "ReviewID": "UR15087860", "Content": "I took my girlfriend to Rome for our 5 year anniversary. We're both mid-twenties. I'm sure some of you might be scared on how to get here because it is outside of the heart of Rome but it's pretty easy. I know I was a little nervous. This is how: Once you get to Fiumicino, you take the train to Tremini. Then take metro A towards Battistini and get off at Cornelia. We got there at night so it was kind of confusing. You have to look around the corner and there's a huge row of buses lined up. The website says to take 889 but we got there sunday night so we had to take the 98 to get to the hotel. It does take work to get there, but it's really not that hard. The actual hotel is nice. The workers are extremely friendly and at your service. They all speak English well so there was never any miscommunication. The room was big. The bed was huge and our room had a 20\" flat screen tv. What's also sweet is coming home from a long day of walking and going to the basement where you can go swimming, hit the jacuzzi, go in the sauna and even take a turkish bath. It's very clean and modern looking and it will definitely relax you. If you need to surf the internet, it only costs 5 euro for an hour which is pretty fair. I've seen a lot of people complain about the free shuttle but we never had a problem. It leaves almost every hour and takes you right where you need to be in Rome. It also picks up at the exact right time so if you're there, you'll never miss it. Everything in Rome is pretty much within walking distance (at least for us) from where the shuttle drops you off. Coloseo, Victor Emmanuel, Campo de Fiori, Piazza Navona are all within 15 mins walking. Vatican City isn't close from the shuttle but then you can just take the bus from the busstop right outside the hotel. The point of going to Rome is to be out and about experiencing all the different areas so you really shouldn't need to go to your hotel until you're done for the day. Thus, the Crown Plaza's location outside of Rome was an absolute non-negative for us.

The hotel is very clean and modern, the room had recently been renovated and was very nice indeed - view of the tennis courts didn't inspire me to exercise sadly, but it was a pleasant place to sit in the evening sunshine. The breakfast was fantastic, and was sufficient that we didn't need to stop for lunch on any of the days we were there ! This is not so much a financial benefit as a time-saving benefit; we had 4 pretty full days of sightseeing, and probably still didn't get to see 1/4 of what Rome has to offer. I pre-booked a breakfast-inclusive rate, so the cost of the breakfast wasn't an issue. Drinks in the hotel bar were excessively expensive, but hey-ho, we were on holiday in Rome and I was under no illusions that this was going to be an exercise in economical city visiting !! The courtesy bus was handy, but taxis are the way to go. I pre-booked a Merc to collect us from Fiumicino and take us back, which was fantastic -- lower prices than airport taxis, and no danger of being fleeced ! I found all of the hotel staff to be very courteous and helpful throughout, and could not fault any of them. As mentioned by many others, the restaurant immediately next door ( Arthuro's) was fantastic -- definitely a must to visit, but closed on Mondays. Open-top bus tour was good value, but it doesn't stop particularly close to many of the sights -- a lot of legwork still required. Enjoyed a fantastic guided tour of the Vatican, by a company called Eden Tours, whom I found via Trip Advisor -- it was a fantastic tour, and I would recommend the company (and especially our guide Grant) to anyone.

I'm sure the renovation improved the look of the place, once it was complete, but it's still not in a convenient location - something the renovation couldn't fix - and it's just not special enough to make me think I will want to go back and pay full price. I'd rather pay a little more and be closer in, or pay even more still and be at the Cavalieri Hilton. Now that's a hotel that's in an inconvenient location, but well worth the trouble.

When we arrived in Rome we made our own way to the hotel, by taking the Terravision bus from the Campino airport to Termini train station. (At the airport we were told that this bus goes every 20 minutes but we had to wait about 2 hours in the midday sun for this bus) I would not recommend it. Registered taxi drivers should not charge any more than 30 euros. We then got the Metro line to Cornelia and took a taxi from there to the hotel. (10 euros including tip). As you can gather from having to take all this transport the hotel is definitely not in central Rome. In fact it\u2019s about 15-20 minutes on the bus to the Vatican and that not at busy spells. We found the complimentary bus to the Vatican satisfactory although we did have to take taxis 3-4 times as well. Please note that if there are large tour parties staying at the hotel and the complimentary bus is full, the bus will leave as soon as it is full, so it is wise to be early. We were staying in a standard room which was below standard. There were a few hair cracks in the sink and part of the shower handle kept falling off when we went to turn it on. Not what you expect from a 4 star. There were no bath robes and we had to ask for them, which was a bit disappointing. The room was spacious and clean and the bed very comfortable. The air conditioning was extremely useful and worked perfectly. We did go for a swim in the indoor pool which was a wonderful and relaxing experience. At the leisure complex when we asked for swimming hats we were given shower caps and flip flops and these were free. We also sat outside by the outdoor pool and relaxed after a days sightseeing which was bliss. The water felt too cold to venture in but the pool was clean and off a high standard. Food in the bar was good and really not badly priced around 60 euros for a full meal for 2. Although we did find the drinks at the bar were expensive, 8 euros for a pint of beer. We didn\u2019t eat in the restaurant as it was over priced and the menu didn\u2019t quite appeal to us. We were booked on a room only basis and we didn\u2019t have breakfast in the hotel but our friends did and their overall impression was that the breakfast buffet had a great variety but overpriced at 18 euros. We found a nice little inexpensive coffee shop in the little shopping area just left of the entrance out of the hotel about \u00bd mile up. Also there is a great little deli type shop selling a vide variety of fine wine, olives, cheeses, sun dried tomatoes etc. If you decide to go to the shopping area, please cross the road just outside the hotel as this road is extremely busy and Italian drivers are maniacs. We did see a girl getting hit by a car on a Zebra crossing and she had to be taken away in an ambulance. This was extremely disturbing and very scary. We did eat twice in Arthuros next door to the Crowne Plaza. The staff were really friendly and the food and wine excellent and very reasonably priced. On our last night there were 5 adults and 2 children and we all had main courses, some puddings, drinks which consisted of 2 large bottles of wine,1 beer, 2 cokes and the bill was around 100 euros. We congratulated the staff on the beautiful food and they sent us out a bottle of champagne and some other tasty sweet treats and even posed with us for photographs.

Although we did a lot of walking, this hotel is still far too out of the way. There is no public transport to Ciampiano Airport and a taxi cost 40 Euros there and 50 Euros back. There is a metro station 20 mins away but you can't walk there as part of the journey would involve walking along the side of a busy road due to there being no pavement and so not possible or safe esp as the road is narrow and buses travel very close to the side. The hotel staff didn't tell us this despite us asking for directions to the metro and we only found out after we started making our way over and had to turn back. When we asked them about this their reply was 'it's possible but I didn't say it would be safe or advisable!!'. This was slightly stressful when we first got there as that part of Rome is not clearly signed (i.e how to get to Metro after getting off bus) but once we got the hang of it, all was fine. The Metro comes in handy if you need to get to the East side of Rome. The Bus stop is right outside the hotel and they are very frequent and easy to use but drop you off just after the Trevere river so still a 20 min walk to Piazza Spagna etc which wasn't really a problem as we liked walking but obviously late at night when tired it would've been nicer to have had the hotel closer. Buses run until midnight everyday. Shuttle bus no good as only goes 4 times a day at odd times and only goes to St Peters - not town as they've stopped that service for some reason. On the positive side, it does get you walking which is not a problem in Rome as you don't notice it and you get to see things you may have otherwise missed. On the plus side, hotel room was brilliant, all mod cons, clean, lots of complimentary products with a balcony. Quiet location and rooms are spacious and king size bed was very comfy - perfect retreat after a long day of walking! This made the hotel worth staying in and the overall mark is pushed up due to this factor. Finally, lobby was a bit run down and staff service okay.

Hotel is a (crowded) bus plus metro ride from most attractions and unfortunately on the first evening my bag was slashed and mobile phone and purse stolen. Interestingly, when I reported it to hotel Reception they handed over a multilingual form for reporting such incidences and directed us to the Carabinieri. Over the next couple of days we observed a group of thieves actively targeting tourists awaiting service buses at the stop right outside the hotel, so beware. The hotel's own coach to the city and to the airport was easily the most convenient and comfortable (and safe!) way of moving around; it is very punctual but runs infrequently. Breakfast was generous and provided a wide range of foods, but service could be chaotic and items often ran out, or burners might not have been lit beneath food to keep it warm. Staff were generally friendly, spoke good English and were helpful with directions; though one day we did approach the concierge, who was lounging against his counter in full uniform, only to be told by him that the desk was \"Closed\" (!).

Some minor details could be fixed though, like a simple paintjob for the reception counter or the tables at the reception desk. I think those are the only negative points about the hotel. The food is quite reasonable, but a bit pricy. As many other reviewers mentioned, right outside the hotel is a restaurant, Arturo which serves great food for a good price with very good service.

Our room was ready at check in - 10:30 A.M. We were given a complimentary shuttle schedule that has public bus and subway information on the back. Having read reviews on this site we knew how to get to shops and small restaurants near the hotel. We also heard the staff giving the info to others checking in - but not terribly detailed. Turn left out of the driveway and go the the first traffic light. Turn left again and follow the main road about 2 - 3 blocks. There is a small pizzaria and shops there, including a great small store that carries fresh cheese, sliced meats, bread, wine, etc. They speak English and are very helpful. We bought cheese, bread, wine and munchies there and used them for light lunches. There is a small fridge in the room to use for cold storage. The room was large and comfortable. The bed was GREAT. Nice linens and duvet for the king size bed. Housekeeping was very helpful. The maid dropped everything to get us a wine opener. The bar area just off reception was lovely, but very expensive. We didn't try it, so we don't know about service there. We ate breakfast every day at the hotel - included with our room. Decent food, including champagne and wine. The hotel is showing it's age, but very clean and comfortable. We used the hotel shuttle every day to get downtown and most days to return to the hotel. One night we stayed late at dinner downtown and missed it - the taxi back was 10.13 euro. The restaurant next door is wonderful - Arthuro's. Turn right at the end of the driveway and walk about a block to it. The food was great, it has a bar area also, and the prices were very reasonable for Rome. Be aware it is closed on Monday. Yes, the sidewalks are very narrow - but this is Europe. The room does have air conditioning - unlike a previous review stated. The thermostat is on the wall. Choose your preferred temp. and slide the switch on the top toward the sun logo on the front. For heat -slide it toward the snowflake. Just remember to put your hotel key into the slot by the door and turn on the main switch below it. In our case our key from the cruise ship did the trick, and the air stayed on even if we needed the hotel keys when we left. We found the room to be very quiet - 4th floor - with our balcony being right over the outdoor restaurant, so we could hear the music they play there every evening. Lovely! All in all - we would recommend this hotel. If you prefer being in walking distance to the sites downtown you probably won't be happy here, but the shuttle gets you to St. Peter's in the morning and downtown -Piazza Venezia- in the afternoon and evening for free. They are prompt, so be ready at the hotel or the drop off points when the schedule says. You can do your check out very easily using the TV. We just dropped the keys at the front desk and went.

My suggestion to the chef is that any welcome dinner for an American group ought to include pasta as a Primi. Be aware that this hotel is not within walking distance of anything of tourist interest. It's out by the film studios and closer to the airport than to town. We took a 15 minute cab ride (12 Euro) to Trestevere for an enjoyable two hours.

There were several other fellow cruisemates booked here also. We arrived from the port at approx. 10:30 am and waited in line a few minutes to register. Our registration was prompt and efficient and the hotel staff spoke very good English. Our room was ready so we were able to put our luggage in it before we headed off to our 12:00 Vatican tour. We were on the 5th floor and our room was very spacious compared to other Rome hotels. It had a large king-size bed, a nice sitting area with table and comfortable chairs, a lovely bathroom with a marble vanity top, nice bathtub and shower, oversize fluffy bath towels, and travel size shampoo, lotion, etc. There were tea and coffee making facilities in the room, an iron and ironing board, hairdryer, and a safe. Our room was extremely quiet and no noise could be heard from outside the room. There was a nice balcony where you could enjoy the view of Rome. The hotel itself was very clean with nice couches and chairs in the lobby area. We did feel that the hotel had a \"gently worn\" look to it & could use some updating but that was our only criticism. There was a nice lounge right off the main lobby & you could also order food there. The concierge staff were very attentive to our needs and would order a taxi for us if one was not available outside the hotel. They also offer a free shuttle bus to St. Peter's Square, the center of Rome and to the airport. We took the shuttle to the airport the next morning. It leaves the hotel at 10:00 am and we arrived at the airport approximately an hour later. The hotel is located away from the mainstream of things so if you want to be conveniently located to all the tourist attractions, then you would probably not want to stay here. However, the metro and busses are conveniently located nearby. We opted to take a cab to St. Peter's Sq. for our Vatican tour and got the cab right outside the hotel lobby. We shared the ride with another couple and it was only E8.00 total for the ride to St. Peter's. My husband and I took a cab from St. Peter's Sq. (the cab drivers sit right there in the square) back to the hotel after our tour and it was E7.00 (rates depend upon which route the cabbies take). LOL The breakfast room was very bright and cheerful and overlooked some lovely gardens. We did not want the breakfast buffet and asked if we could order a light breakfast instead. The hostess said we could have a pot of coffee, a glass of juice and a croissant for E5.00 pp. That is what we had and it was sufficient for us as we were heading to the airport. Our checkout was very prompt and efficient also. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at Crowne Plaza St. Peter's Hotel. We had read some negative reviews from people that had stayed there but we could not find fault with anything. We would, indeed, stay there again and would recommend the hotel to others. I consider myself to be very picky about hotels but loved our stay there. We ate dinner with our fellow cruisemates at a small Italian restaurant right around the corner from the hotel that had such fantastic food. Very reasonable also.

I feel that my experience was enhanced, because I knew what to expect beforehand from the informative reviews on Trip Advisor. Thus, I hope I can pass on some tips to others. First, we arrived at Fiumicino Airport, at about 8:30 am. Unfortunately, this meant that we missed the 8:00 courtesy bus to the hotel, and we were too tired to wait for the next bus, which was scheduled to come at 11:15. (Other airport pickups are scheduled at 2:30, 6:30, and 9:00. Just look for a large red bus outside of arrivals.) Therefore, we checked out the taxis, and limo services, and were able to engage a driver for $40 EU. Upon our arrival at the hotel, the reception desk was very helpful, and they let us go to our room, even though it was well before check-in time. Everyone speaks English very well, and they were very helpful. The first thing I asked for was a schedule for the courtesy bus. We were able to plan our sightseeing around the hotel's bus schedule, and thus, only had to hire a taxi at the end of each day. The hotel room had excellent amenities, which are often not available in Rome, including iron, hair dryer, hot pot for boiling water, free instant coffee and tea, and a refrigerator. We removed the hotel's water, soda, liquor, etc, from the refrigerator, and chose not to use these, because the prices were exorbitant. Instead, at the end of our sightseeing ventures each afternoon, we sought out a supermarket, and purchased necessities, such as water, soda, lunch meat, and other goodies. The restaurant at the hotel was expensive, but not much worse than the restaurants in Rome center. We chose to eat dinner each night at a different restaurant in Rome. There is a restaurant at the end of the hotel driveway, but it was closed for August. However, if you go to the end of the driveway and turn left, you will find a narrow sidewalk, which will take you to a pizzeria, fruit stands, and gelaterias. We even took a day out for an excursion to Capri, which was arranged by the hotel's concierge. Incidentally, Capri is beautiful and unforgettable. The main reason we stayed at Crowne Plaza, however, was price. We booked a room with 2 double beds, several months ago, at the hotel's website, and the price was incredibly low, thereby saving us at least a thousand dollars over the cost of a comparable hotel in city center, which can buy alot of taxis, dinners, etc. Finally, the hotel has outdoor and indoor pools, a jacuzzi, and an exercise room. All are clean and pleasant. If you are looking for a city hotel, right in the middle of all the action, then this is not the hotel for you. However, if you can plan your day wisely and enjoy some quiet at night, then you'll love the place. If you decide to stay at Crowne Plaza, I hope your experience will be as delightful as ours was.", "Date": "August 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cCrowne Plaza, comfortable and friendly!!!\u201d", "Author": "rhondafae", "ReviewID": "UR3802629", "Content": "Planning a trip to Europe for five adults is stressful enough, especially when you run across poor reviews about your accomodations just days before departure! I'll admit, I was uneasy, and even moreso when we entered the Crowne Plaza lobby. During my last (2003) trip to Rome, my husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Roma. Although the property was lovely, I swore I'd never darken their door again simply because of the snobbish, uncaring attitude of the staff. My first impression of the Crown Plaza was that it looked \"tired\". The exterior design was clearly from the early 1970's, and the lounge furniture just to the left of the front entrance matched it, perfectly. My apprehension level rose as we proceeded to our rooms. The beds had the same tired, used look and indeed, when the covers were turned back, there were tiny holes in the sheets, just as I'd read!! That, however, is where my disappointment ended. We LOVED it!!! The staff (with the exception of one doorman/bellman who while efficient, wasn't friendly) was absolutely wonderful! There was entertainment in the lounge every night and our bartender was a delight to come home to after a hard day of sight-seeing. We either took the courtesy bus to St.Peters each day or caught a cab to Cornelia Metro. I'm sorry to say that the restaurant reviews are dead-on. We ate there twice and the breakfast buffet every day. It's pricey and although the service is superior, the food is barely palatable. I'd love to see the bar menu expanded! The bottom line is, leave your snobbish, high-brow standards at home and enjoy this beautiful, inviting property. Tiny holes in snow-white sheets didn't disrupt my peaceful sleep one bit!

After a torturous taxi ride (beware rip off taxis and make sure you belt up!), we arrived at our hotel and were pleased with what we saw. On first impression, you see a very smart hotel, well presented and with excellent facilities. We negotiated a mass of Americans in the lobby who were booked onto Princess Cruises (this hotel is their stopover in Rome) and checked in. Our room was spacious, airy and had a balcony with a very nice view of the outdoor pool. Using our first day to familiarise ourselves with the hotel and surrounding area, we were impressed with the facilities that included a spa, tennis courts and plush green grounds as well as the aforementioned outdoor pool. Outside the hotel, however, there is an extremely busy road that really is not comfortable to walk along, there being virtually no pavement. What little pavement there was, led to nothing. There is nothing of any interest along this stretch of road, apart from a Pizzeria at the top end (a good 5 minute walk). We decided, however, to eat in the hotel restaurant the first night - and boy did we regret it! It's overpriced, stingy portions and not particularly well cooked. I remarked to my friend that the table next to us had ordered starters which looked tasty - imagine my surprise when our \"main\" meal turned out to be exactly what the next table had been presented with. Two snotty pieces of beef sitting on the plate with a couple of apple slices beside and no veg! We were told that veg was in the buffet server - but not that we had to pay extra for that. Very expensive! We ate out the rest of our stay and found that other guests in the bar were warning off the newer guests about eating in the hotel restaurant. Would that we'd been in the bar before we had ventured into the restaurant ourselves!! Staff at the hotel were helpful, although the bar staff are pretty slow. Order your drink - then, when it arrives, order your second and you should get it around the time you finish your first. Make sure you take flip-flops or slippers with you if you want to use the spa - or they'll charge you a whopping 4Euro for theirs before they let you in. Experience the violent jacuzzi - it has to be done, its like no other I've been in. Don't rely on the courtesy coaches, they aren't so frequent and you'll have to get taxis or public transport to get you back from the centre unless you go and come back really early. The doormen are very helpful and have a very good system for getting you a taxi to take you where you want to go - they'll also give you an idea of how much it will cost you (believe me, ask!) On the whole, this is an acceptable hotel. Good amenities but not very well sited to get around and not really what I expect from a supposed four star hotel.", "Date": "May 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Yorkshire England", "Title": "\u201cWe enjoyed our stay - excellent value for money\u201d", "Author": "MC", "ReviewID": "UR3431636", "Content": "We booked the hotel on the strength of the comments here on Trip Advisor. The hotel represented excellent value for money at Euro 120 per room per night (we got an early booking deal). When we arrived the staff were friendly, warm, welcoming and very helpful. Nothing appeared too much trouble for them and we could see they were very very busy all the time. As we checked in, they took great trouble to make sure we had a map and were able to know how to make the most of our short time in Rome. The room was above average in size, clean and the bed was huge, and as somebody else noted, there were complimentary chocolates and water each day. The outdoor pool was a bonus and likewise so was the indoor pool, sauna, steam room gym (all free) Before you stay at this hotel, shop around and see what you can get for 120 Euro's a night and then read the ratings!!! I noticed some people complained about the location. It's a short taxi ride to the Vatican and depending on the time of day or night it is 8 Euro's upwards. None of the taxi drivers cheated us, they took us the most reasonable route available for the time of day.

We were fortunate enough to book our stay early and secured a room for 4 nights during the week of the Pope's funeral. The nearest train station is San Pietro but from here, you'd definitely need a taxi. We thought it would be a 30 mins walk max, but it took us more than an hour. Plus, the roads leading to the hotel had no pavements so it's very dangerous. The only public transport which stops outside the hotel are two buses and neither of them stop at San Pietro. My advice is to catch a bus from Via Paola. The hotel is not the easiest to reach. The reception staff gave a below average standard of service for a 4-star hotel. Our return flight was cancelled due to air space being unavailable. We asked the staff if they could find out any information for us but they referred me to the airline's website. I had to pay 5 EURO for 30 mins internet access which is very very expensive. The staff were also not helpful about transport links to the city centre and offered minimal information. I was very disappointed with the level of service. Our room was a king-size room. It was reasonably clean but I noticed peeling paint in one corner of the room. We also had a balcony which wasn't anything special. The bathroom was reasonably clean but small. Our fridge door was slightly broken but not too serious. For a discerning guest, this would probably have been an acceptable room. We also dined in the restaurant. The service was nothing special. I asked the waitress what she recommended and she didn't seem to understand my English. I ordered the lamb and it was nice but the portion was small. The cost of the meal was also high compared to outside. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're tired and you don't want to venture out. The location of the hotel is far from the city centre and it takes ~ 30 mins bus journey to get to Piazza Venezia (the centre). The hotel runs a shuttle service to Piazza Venezia but there are only 2 services to and fro!!! There are no shuttle buses to any airports. Overall, disappointing for a 4-star hotel and the Crowne PLaza chain.", "Date": "April 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado Springs, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cWe really liked this place!!\u201d", "Author": "MaryPal", "ReviewID": "UR3395353", "Content": "I don't know where to start. The room was great, clean, a good size for Europe and had a really nice little balcony with chairs to sit outside. We are very down to earth, casual people, so a fancy dinner was not what we wanted. We ate in the lobby bar instead, of the hotel rest., the food was great, you get alot of it, and our waiter Stephan took such good care of us, and he was so friendly!! My mother in law went down to work out and swim while we ate, and she said that pool was beautiful, and the people that worked down there, treated her just wonderfully!! There is a very conveinent bus stop right at the end of the driveway to get to the Vatican, or else there is a taxi station right outside in the parking lot. Everyone that worked there could speak perfect English which can be a problem in Italy and was also very nice.

The hotel is set back from a (very busy) road, in beautiful landscaped gardens. The pool area and spa look great. The restaurant was expensive and had very, very small portions, however service was immaculate. There are two pianists - the main one plays in the restaurant in the evenings and then moves to the bar. His repertoire is very limited, basically he plays the same cheesy stuff over and over again, plus he \"sings\" in a gruff Italian \"doesn't matter whether I'm in tune or not\" manner. The pianist that plays in the restaurant at breakfast however is extremely good. In order to get to the Metro station, you really need to take a local bus. The bus stop is right outside the hotel and you can buy tickets from the reception desk. It's only a ten minute ride, but I wouldn't recommend walking it - the road is very busy and there is no footpath most of the way. The courtesy bus into town only leaves the hotel at 8.45am and 12noon and even then only goes to St Peter's. It would make much more sense for this hotel to run a bus every 30 mins to the Metro station - but they don't. There is also a taxi rank at the hotel which was extremely useful. Our room was spacious and clean, there is English language TV available and pay per view movies if you want them. The reception staff were also very helpful and courteous. I think if you want a hotel in Rome that is slightly away from the action, then this place is right for you.

I think the best thing about the hotel is that we were allowed to check into our rooms at 8:30 AM. That is great after a long 18 hours on planes and in airports. Hotel was clean, beds comfortable, and the bathroom the largest we had during the two weeks in Italy. The hotel bar was good for a late evening drink and the staff was helpful. Because of the cold temperatures we were unable to use the pool and other outdoor facilities, but they looked nice. When we travel we do not hesitate to take what ever transportation is the most available and convenient. The bus when available was just down the drive but you always had to wait and then take 20 plus minutes to get into the city center. We often took the taxi, no matter where you go it cost 10E, or at least seemed so. Taxis were always available when we walked out the door. The only meals we ate at the hotel were breakfast and felt they were very over priced even by Italian standards. Did not look for anything else near the hotel as we were alway in a hurry to start our day of sightseeing. There is a restaurant just outside the hotel entrance to the right. It opens at 7:30 PM. Good food, good service, frendly neighborhood atmosphere, good price, and good wine. What else could you ask for. While I did not find anything bad about the hotel, next time I would try to find something closer to the city center.
