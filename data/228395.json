Rooms are old, dusty, even dirty. A major disappointment for a Mercure class hotel. Staff at the reception is unfriendly. Easter Sunday morning, at 8.00AM, two cleaning ladies started to shout very loudly in the corridor - it lasted half an hour despite our remarks. Fair to say the breakfast is good, despite a lack of staff - anyway not very helpful (they do speak only German). We asked for a quiet room, arrived at 1PM (check-in starts at 3PM) but got a street room, very noisy. The hotel is not on Alexanderplatz, rather 400m away. We asked to park the car in the parking behind the hotel, but were told to leave the car in the street and put coins in the machine - while there was enough place empty in the parking.

Sheets were clean and were changed daily. Complimentary Wi-Fi worked most of the time. We also used the computers in the lobby to check some addresses. There was a chance to store luggage for 1 euro per locker, which was really useful both when we arrived before we could check in and when we checked out and had some hours to spend before our flight took off. Toilet and shower were clean and bright and had plenty of fresh towels. Biggest minus was that there was no way to lock the bathroom door. We didn't eat the hotel breakfast, but someone said it cost 18 euros, which is a lot considering you could buy croissants, bread and coffee next door for a few euros. The city is also full of a lot of great bakeries where breakfast with bread and coffee costs 4-5 euros. I should point out that this hotel is not really on Alexanderplatz, but rather one block away.

Everything is whitewash and we joked that it looked like a Nazi experimentation room, (we were visiting a concentration camp the next day) and there were creepy pipes coming out of the walls for no apparent purpose. The room smelled like smoke and was just flat out creepy. I felt bad for our other roomie who had to sleep in the adjacent room alone! The surrounding area was ghetto! There were obscene amounts of graffiti, rundown buildings, and terminated businesses. It was very communistic, like seriously nothing had changed since the Wall came down.

Before our second night there, we killed a few additional mosquitoes and sprayed ourselves with OFF insect repellant. We woke up with more bites. We complained to the front desk, but they just blew us off and said they know they have a mosquito problem and there wasn't anything they could do about it. If the hotel knows it's a problem, perhaps they should do something about it...invest in screens for the windows or air conditioning or fumigation...instead they did nothing and we walked around Berlin with red itchy bumps.

The room was clean and comfortable, reception was what I would expect from Germany as its more military than other countries. Reception staff were polite and did an efficient job, housekeeping were good the room was cleaned everyday and the towels were changes. There was no smell in the toilet which again was spotless with a good shower. Breakfast was exceelent and well stocked at all times the turn round on the tables was good unlike some British hotels we have stayed in. Its in a good location, the local station is Alexanderplatz which is about 10 minutes walk from the hotel, on the airport express train its just over 20 minutes to Alexanderplatz. Trams and buses run past the door and you can get anywhere in Berlin using the S or U Bhan a day ticket for zones A & B cost \u00a36 GBP (6.10 Euro). Attractions are exspensive some as much as 20 Euro. There is a nice restaurant not far from the Agon very nice food and good steaks. There is a food happy hour on Wednesday evenings and Sunday afternoon where all food is half price. We were luck as the Happy hour was on all evening every evening. Anybody going for the Gay Scene this hotel is some distance away, there are three areas and there is a need to use the U or S Bhan to get to them. The scene is not like in the UK in main it does not start to open until the evening and most bars and clubs do not open until 10pm or later, its good if you are a night owl as it goes on then until 6am.

Perhaps some people dont understand that it is only 20 years since the wall came down in Berlin and they are still doing quite a bit of construction work around Alexanderplatz. But it is by far the best location nevertheless, because it is so ideally located for getting to almost anywhere in Berlin. Generally we found the Berliners to be very friendly people but I have to agree with those who say the staff in reception at the Agon are a little lukewarm about the welcome you get. Is this a hangover from the old East German days? I dont know but it didnt spoil our stay and we will certainly go to the Agon again next year if the price has not increased dramatically. I asked for a room at the back of the hotel (less noise from the traffic) and they obliged. They were efficient in the reception area, just not as friendly as most hotel staff we've come across. But in other areas of the hotel the staff were great. No doubt if we had paid ten times as much, we would have got a better hotel. But the Agon is very good and they have some great deals. They do not serve lunch or evening meals but there is a very good choice of places to eat at in and around Alexanderplatz.

It took us 5 mins to actually get into the room via key card as had no idea how to use it (No instructions given at desk!!) First impression of room...not to bad, quite spacious and looked clean. Opened bathroom door and stepped back from 'strange' smell, toilet had been used but not flushed...oversight by cleaners perhaps?? Room stuffy so opened window and was literally BLASTED by the noise from the extremely busy cross-roads right outside our window...'thank goodness I remembered my ear-plugs' I thought. Both fell into bed exhausted and tried to sleep...no chance for me I'm afraid, the traffic noise was just to great, even with plugs!! In the morning, breakfast turned out to be chaos with other guests stood with plates of food but nowhere to sit as not enough room. We stood and waited (being British we queued of course!!!) and eventually got a table. You are NOT allowed to help yourself to the cutlery so we had to wait for that. Food was adequate and you are able to eat as much of it as you like. I asked at the reception if a fan was available so that I could shut the window but this request met with a very hostile \"NO, YOU ARE NOT TO HAVE ONE!!!!\" So we returned to our stuffy, airless OR very noisy room. Other problems that cropped up was that we bought some cakes but they needed a fork , my son asked very politely at the reception to borrow 2 forks, guess what...we weren't allowed!!(Eating cakes using a plastic credit card is quite ingenious I think!!) I was plagued by mosquitoes and have ended up with 6 nasty, very inflamed bites which resulted me seeking medical advice about ( not from anyone at the hotel though, I hasten to add!!) Because of the mozzie problem, we ended up having to go through the night with the window shut in a room where the temp was 75 degrees(thermometer in room) so woke up with headaches, sweaty and feeling generally yuk!! I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone I liked. We both loved Berlin but our trip was definitely marred by the accommodation.

We were kept waiting as we were told we might not be able to stay, the hotel at this point was empty so what is the problem. The staff were extreamly rude and persisted in ignoring everything we asked untill we gave up and went to our rooms. First night On getting changed i went downstairs to meet the other people in our party. I went up to the bar / front desk were a german man sat doing some paperwork, pollightly asked for a drink only to be screamed at that he was trying to work (got no drink and went back to speak to my party). We left the hotel and went around berlin, on returning the security gaurd was so rude and in our faces that we were all left speachless. Morning Me and some ofthers make our way to the bar / front desk again this german man resides working. We ask again for a drink (which we are paying a lot of money for, and being a large group i mean a lot of money) only for him to stand up lean over the counter and scream the bar is closed and he doesn't have time for us. At this point i respond that we paid to be here and it is his job to serve us. We got our drinks and our change was thrown on the counter, my friend left picking it up off the floor. Second night We arrive in the lobby (by the stairs the lift was broke) to find a film crew shooting for the hotel and were told we could not leave or speak. We could not get a drink and had to wait 30 minutes to get out as the back door was locked to stop people wandering in during the filming. At arrival back to the hotel the doors were locked so we pressed the buzzer only to be confronted by the security gaurd screaming abuse in german because he didn't understand we were guests. not even an appology At this point without rambling on you can all see the pattern, this hotel has the worst customer service of any i have ever been to. The rest of the trip was good but how this filthy hotel was given 3 stars is beyond reason for all FOURTEEN people who stayed.

On a previous review there was mention of the very rude lady at breakfast, we met her and know what you mean. Nasty looks and god help you if you want a knife to eat your bread with. Not all of the staff were rude, but those that weren't needed to be warmed up to be friendly. On asking for a taxi to the airport at the end of our stay we were told NO, they will be busy, walk and find one. 8 of us with cases and the nearest taxi rank 10 mins walk away. We then asked a different receptionist who called immediately and the taxi was there 10 mins after. The hotel was sold to us as 4* - it isn't, we got there and it was listed as 3*, so don't be fooled like we were. There are other hotels at similar pricing nearer the 'nicer' parts of the city than this one, and they are 4*. The rooms were OK, but agree the pillows are non existent, you daren't ask for another one, and there were NO facilities at the hotel to speak of. We asked for a coffee at the 'BAR' which is an extention of the reception desk with the reception person serving you and got two arms in the air and huff at such a request. Bear in mind there are no coffee making facilities in the room. However drinks can be brought from a dispensor on the 3rd and 6th floors via a VENDING MACHINE. We had one outside our room, nice. The main disappointment of this hotel is that there are no bars or restaurants close by, and we had to taxi to find anywhere decent to eat out of the depressing, opressive area we were in. You did not feel safe walking through the empty streets around this hotel. If they opened up the restaurant in the evening and had a proper bar it would make a huge difference to the hotel. Alexanderplatz is 5 mins walk away with shops but to get where the real life is in Berlin means travel. I have not written a review on a hotel before as not felt it necessary so I feel strongly that at the Agon Alexanderplatz, they are getting it very wrong.

Where the room and corredors don't smell stale and the lifts don't smell of wee and there is life outside the hotel to relax at the end of a fantastic days sightseeing.

The first difference is location; this is not the elegance and liveliness of the main square of Alexanderplatz, but instead a slightly run-down district of former East Berlin still very much in its East German era, with little elegance or refurbishment. The second difference is PRICE, we paid 62 Euros a night (40quid in British) for a double-suite and I think that is FANTASTIC value. Incidentally \"Lastminute.Com\" wanted 62POUNDS for the same booking - do they think we British are too stupid to know the difference between a Euro and a Pound? The hotel is not elegant, but nor is is untidy or run-down. Our room was a suite comprising: an ante-room with warddrobes, shelves, mirror, space to put cases, prams, bicycles. A shower/toilet room (no bath, no bidet), with all plumbing fully working and kept clean everyday, and heated. Then through an inner door into the main room which was about 5metres x 5metres and comprised two generous single beds, a large desk/shelf on one wall with some drawers underneath, a lounge area with 2 chairs and table and wall-mounted TV (only the ghastly CNN as an English Language Channel). There was also a kitchenette with sink, twin hot rings, cupboards and shelves - everything to cook a meal, but no fridge, no pans, crockery or utensils. Then there was a full width balcony overlooking the noisy Mollstrasse - those Trams run ALL Night long! We kept our milk and food on the balcony as this was like a fridge in the December air. The room was generously heated, and we were able to control this. I cannot say if there was air-conditioning in the room, so summer occupation may be difficult Our room rate included buffet breakfast, and whilst this doesn't sound very hearty, in fact it was large. Hot Scrambled eggs and sausages, also hard-boiled eggs. Masses of cold meats, cheeses, salads, fruits, yoghurts, juices, teas, coffees, cereals, milks, cakes, breads ... We walked from the Alexanderplatz S-Bahn to this hotel, so its location was not a problem. Far easier is the Tram, the M6 stops outside the Hotel in Otto Braunstrasse, but the M4 and M5 trams also stop outside on Mollstrasse (2 stops frm S and U Alexanderplatz. On the north side of Otto Braunstrasse (diagonally across from the hotel) you can catch buses 100, 200, and TXL which will run to Brandenburger Tor and Unter Den Linden.

I hve stayed here three times, and tend to make this my base when I visit my favourite city. It is a budget hotel made from a converted appartment block. The rooms vary from generously sized to suites, and all I have seen also have a cooker and sink. It is about 5 minutes from Alexanderplatz, the centre of the old East Berlin,and in my opinion the best bit of Berlin. Because of its history Berlin has two centres, the shopping bit is in the old West Berlin, which is a short train ride away, so if you want shopping on your doorstep then that is the area to go to. This part of Berlin has most of the museums, great cheap eats, and the cathederal. The area around the hotel is a bit grimy but I have never seen any trouble there, and there is a lot of redevelopment of the Alexanderplatz area. As far as the airport is concerned, the TXL express bus stops almost outside of the hotel. Furthermore, it is right at the end of the route, so you can't go too far, and on the way back you are certain to get a seat. My advice, go there, enjoy the fact it is not in the main tourist area.

Although some parts of the hotel are OK, there is too much against it to say this is a good hotel. We arrived in Berlin from Tegel airport which does not have its own train station, you have to get on a bus which will take you to a station on the U-Bahn so we ended up catching a taxi to the hotel instead which came to about 25 Euro's which is cheaper than most taxi's to other European cities we have been to. Initial impressions of the place are understandibly quite bad. Its right in the heart of the old East Berlin so every building in the area is communist in design, rectangular and not pretty and surrounded by busy main roads. Inside though is a bit better, checking in was quick but some of the staff behind reception need a few lessons in customer service (ie. a smile or even some acknowledgment when handing in keys wouldn't go amiss). We got a room on the first floor, used the 2 lifts initially which look more like detention cells, walked through the dark and very green hallway to our room. We had a south facing room which meant we were away from the main noise from the traffic and could see the main highrises around Alexanderplatz but did overlook some other grotty buildings. From then on we used the stairs coming to and from the room but in the evenings these are pitch black. The room in fairness was very spacious and included its own area for the wardrobe, a free to use safe, small table and chair in the middle of the floor (and a pretty stained floor at that) and a small kitchenette in the corner (although nothing is included to use with it so unless you bring your own pots, pans and cutlery I see little point in this being here). Bathroom is basic including a shower cubicle (complete with a large damp patch in the corner). The double room was in fact 2 twin beds so you will have to move them together but the covers only just fit the width of the single beds and the pillow is virtually non existent and even doubling up is not enough so sleeping for us was hard to achieve. There is also no air conditioning either and so the room can get quite warm especially in the evening. The room also has its own balcony which has not been cleaned for ages and still had traces of what used to shield the balcony along the side so could be quite dangerous as these are very sharp. Being on the first floor we could not leave the balcony door or window open as anyone could potentially climb in if they wanted to make an effort Breakfast was included in the price although nothing to shout home about, there were no hot breakfast options available, only a few cold meats, plenty of cereal and bread rolls and a handful of cake slices. My wife thought the breakfast was excellent though but hot breakfasts are more to my liking. The location I would say is well within walking distance to the majority of sites up to the Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag, beyond that you may want to choose the U-Bahn or S-Bahn instead, the nearest one being in Alexanderplatz some 5 minutes away. I would say one thing though, coming home when its dark to the hotel is quite off putting as its not very busy at all and very dark in places but there is a tram station round the corner. The trams though only serve the old East side. We paid just \u00a3149.75 for the 3 nights which is exceptionally cheap and therefore the review has to be put into that kind of perspective. If I were coming to Berlin again, I would probably find a hotel nearer the Brandenburg Gate so its more central to all sites and would be happy to pay a bit more but for those on a budget and do not mind relinquishing some comforts then this hotel is fine. Personally the fact that I had major trouble sleeping in the room is the largest factor to decide if a hotel is good or bad and in this case I would stay here again.", "Date": "June 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tunbridge Wells", "Title": "\u201cDon't get stuck in the lift!!!\u201d", "Author": "RogerKent", "ReviewID": "UR6908888", "Content": "Hotel was ok I guess, however upon entering the lift on our way down to breakfast, the lift brokedown on us.

We found the hotel to be extremely good value, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere cheap, comfortable, clean and safe. The rooms were huge and the bathrooms were perfectly adequate, with one of the most powerful showers I have ever used. There was plenty of wardrobe space, and an electronic safe. There was also a TV with about 20 channels, a small kitchenette area and a fridge. Check in and check out were both hassle free, and the staff were pleasant and efficient. A good breakfast was available in the lobby from 7:00 \u2013 10:00 and had a large selection of fruit, cereal and yogurt, as well as breads, meats and cheeses. There were no hot choices. The bar is part of the reception, and was therefore open 24 hours a day. German beer costs 2 euro (\u00a31.40) per bottle. The location of the Agon is its big advantage.

In four and a half hours we saw all of Berlin\u2019s main attractions including the spectacular boulevard of Unter den Linden, the Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall, the site of Hitler\u2019s bunker, the memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe, Museum Island, and the two main cathedrals. There was a 30 minute break for lunch at a nice cafe. The tour was in English and there were about 40 people of all ages on it.
