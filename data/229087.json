We had booked the standard room category, expecting that such a high standard of property would be well appointed at this level, but sadly not. My heart did sink when we entered the room, it was small, very small, and dark, giving us a very oppressive feeling. We had been on a real high, Roma is the most amazing place, but when we got to this room we felt really gutted to end our last few days here. We asked to upgrade, which the concierge - who was super by the way, was able to sort us out another room in a higher category for an additional 80 euros a night which I think was a reasonable price for the improvement we got in the room. So - this improved the situation, as the next room was much bigger, with nicer decor. I know Roma is expensive and you pay for location. My advice for this property is to choose a higher category of room than the standard types. The concierge recommended a restaurant to us called Guatano Costa, at Via Veneto - he booked us a table there, we had a fabulous dinner, the ambience is very en vogue - modern contemporary, excellent service, totally fabulous dining experience, I am grateful to the concierge for his advice on this one. Roma is magical, expensive yes, but you expect this. We loved our visit, and would definitely return , but maybe experience a different property that suits us more.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta", "Title": "\u201cThe Inn at The Spanish Steps..... remember that name.\u201d", "Author": "Irvansaid", "ReviewID": "UR128205736", "Content": "We just came back from travelling around Europe for 24 days, our first stop was\"The Inn\", and oh boy what a nice hotel to start a long romantic trip, it was indeed a memorable stay. Gina, the previous reviewer is my wife, and we both were so grateful for the upgraded room, the view was fantastic and the room was quite spacious considering the super prime location this little boutique hotel is located. I was a little apprehensive at first, since I'm use to big hotels, because the entrance to The Inn was quite deceiving as it was rather small, a little dark, and yes... the tiny elevator scared me a little bit. But that was it, the room was surprisingly marvelous. If you are a shopaholic for branded fashion items than look no further, this is the hotel for you. Downstairs next to the lobby is Cartier, opposite is Bvlgari, Gucci etc etc. My wife nearly had a branded stroke, luckily for our credit cards, it was our first city and we didn't want to carry shopping bags all around Europe. So instead, we walked around Rome and I was surprised to see how close everything was! Trevi fountain, Colosseum, etc etc...nearly all tourist attractions are within walking distance. The service is another thing, it was great! I had great breakfasts, and if you guys from the Inn are reading this, please tell me what kind of coffee you serving in the morning? I miss that coffee.

It was the hardest bed I have ever slept on and could really only compare it to sleeping on a dining room table. We enjoyed the hotel very much and made it through the stay on the bed and slept pretty well, but if these recommendations are going to have any merit I believe that issue has to be mentioned. Hopefully they will look into upgrading the beds in the near future. I would recommend the hotel to others, but I would want them to be aware of the bed situation before making their final decision.

I think we would have been shattered trying to find it in the rain had we had to get the bus. Check in was easy and our room was spacious and clean. One downside was the lack of tea/ coffee in room - this wouldn't have cost much and if like me you like tea before bed bring a travel kettle. We were informed that breakfast was a full English however it wasn't (although probably some discrepancy in definition). It consisted of lots of lovely cakes, pastries, cereals and a bit of cold scrambled egg and bacon. What didn't help was the seating- wicker sun lounger type chairs not conducive to sitting up and eating more suited to sitting back and relaxing and quite uncomfortable. The hotel did offer a free buffet in the evening but the drinks were charged and weren't cheap. The hotel was in the perfect location for all sights and very comfortable after a long day. There is a spar supermarket and a mcdonalds cafe round the corner to solve the tea problem. Lots of lovely restaurants close by near the steps. Lovely designer shops on the same street. We were due to come home the day after the snowfall and we had booked a private care back to the airport. We were informed on the morning of our departure Franco at reception informed is the cars were not running and we would have to rely on taxis or public transport. Easier said than done when not a taxi in sight and a vey difficult walk with bags to the stations.

The first exception to that was mostly just bad luck - we had a family staying down the hall with young children who apparently were still on North American time and who awoke us before 6 a.m. by going from their room to their parents approximately 30 times, with two accompanying door slams for each trip. This review isn't of said children's parent's parenting skills so I have not docked marks for that other than a slight deduction for the lack of soundproofing, which is unfortunately common in most of the hotels we have stayed over the years. The second issue is also minor but is the fault of the hotel - the towels were few and far between, and not what I would classify as suitable for a luxury property (small-ish and not very plush). We also had trouble throughout Italy figuring out why no facecloths, but I think thats more of a cultural thing than a hotel issue - it was the case everywhere except the big north-american chain we stayed at. Third, the room was exceedingly small and the bed exceedingly hard. There is a note on the hotel website that the classic double room (which we stayed in) in the main hotel are smaller than their counterparts in the annex, but I also note that there are no pictures of the smaller room on the website to show you just how much smaller. Since we forgot to take pictures, I will describe it as what I'll call the European classic, with maybe 5 inches on either side of the bed, and a bathroom with about 6 square inches of counter space. There was some room for clothes in a wardrobe but unpacking (or doing anything really) in the room was akin to playing Tetris given the lack of space. The bed along with the towels was also not what I was expecting out of something calling itself a luxury property - again the European classic, being small and a few notches above a piece of plywood in terms of comfort. The TV also only had about 3 working channels but we wouldn't have watched it anyway. On the plus side I can echo many of the other positives you will see in the other reviews. The location is truly outstanding, the staff very pleasant and helpful, and the rooftop lounge and breakfast are great as others have indicated. Everything was also very clean and the air conditioning blessedly worked well in the Rome summer heat. If this hotel marketed itself as something other than a luxury property (and/or charged less) I would not hesitate to give it a 5/5. However, for what we paid (almost 300 euro with the breakfast supplement) and with the negatives noted above I would rate it closer to a 3.5/5, rounding up to a 4 because of the great location and staff. I think the best way to sum up would be that we were disappointed because our expectations were so high - lower yours (and don't book the classic double) and it is probably a fine option. One other thing - if you are flying into Rome and staying here be sure to arrange to have them pick you up - in contrast to the other items this is a great value at 55 euro (pretty much what a cab will cost you) and its a huge relief to see someone holding a card with your name on it after a long day of travel.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kinnelon, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLovely, romantic inn at the heart of Rome\u201d", "Author": "pjonthego", "ReviewID": "UR115319284", "Content": "This is a lovely small inn at the bottom of the Spanish Steps where we stayed to celebrate our 25th anniversary.

The 'family' room is simply a portable bed in a slightly larger room, and with an appropriate price increase. The bathroom is very small and whilst appropriate for the age of the building, it's not appropriate for 5 stars. Cafe Greco is Italian snobbery at it's laughable best. The waiters will ignore you for up to 20 minutes before deigning to accept your order. Coffee was barely average but the service is classic Fawlty Towers.

But with Prada and Cartier right next door, and Bulgari, Gucci and Louis Vuitton across the street, there's no doubt that this hotel is all about location location location. The lobby is tiny and nothing to write home about, but the porter Pasquale is very welcoming and inviting. More importantly, we arrived at the hotel at 8am after our redeye flight from NY, and even though our room wouldn't be ready until about 1pm, they checked us in and held our bags for us, so that we could wander around without having to worry about them. At that time in the morning, we had a choice between a room at the Annex and a room in the main building. They said the rooms at the Annex were larger, but based on the reviews I had read, I preferred to be in the main building because that's where breakfast and snacks are served. We ended up getting room 401, which faces onto a courtyard vs. the street, so there was no street noise like I had read about, but I have to admit it would have been fun to have a birdseye view from my window of the street, which is a bit of a people watching mecca, though probably overrun with tourists similar to how Times Square is crowded on a Saturday night in the summer. The room was relatively quiet, but every once and a while we'd hear knocking or water dripping very loudly in the middle of the night when it rained outside, which actually woke us up, believe it or not. I was pleasantly surprised by the room, it had one 110volt US outlet, which meant I didn't have to worry about buying a converter or potentially frying any electronics. A hair dryer was provided too, and the shower had great water pressure. And though the room was small, they still managed to squeeze in a decent sized flat screen TV! The 5th floor terrace is very charming, and the breakfast and afternoon/evening snack buffets are fantastic! They even served prosciutto, salumi and several types of cheeses and grapes. You can order a glass of wine to accompany the afternoon snacks. There's also a great view of Via Condotti and the Spanish Steps from the terrace. You have to pay for WiFi, but it's reasonably priced, and I was glad to not be tied down to an ethernet cable. The elevator is the tiniest thing I've ever been on, so be warned if you are claustrophobic. The staff all speak English, and it also seems a majority (or all) of the guests are from Stateside. The air conditioning was very cold, which is such a welcome change from my last experience in Italy, where the AC didn't work and so we had to open the windows and deal with buzzing mosquitos all night long. Overall, the rooms were very clean, and they even changed our towels twice a day. No, this is not a 5-star luxury full service hotel with all the amenities you'd expect for royalty, but it has charm, a good value (considering that there are many comparably priced and officially rated hotels that received much worse TripAdvisor ratings), and an amazing location. The only drawback is that the bulk of restaurants are a bit of a walk from here, as this is more of a shopping mecca vs a dining mecca. And you will have to take several steps once you step off the elevator, for those of you that can't do steps.

I noticed on their web site that they also have an annex building, so it would be helpful if someone could review that as well. We were in the main building, Room 305, which looks out on Via dei Condotti. They said it was an upgrade from the Deluxe Double Room I had booked on the web for 319 Euros (including breakfasts for 2) plus 10% tax per night. It was clear to me that the 30-day advance booking price (with deposit) was going to go up after the 30-day deadline, so I went ahead and booked. They told us that they were full-up by the time we got there. Internet was 15 Euros for two days, very high speed. (This was essential for grabbing the last Borghese gallery tickets available!) This is a small hotel, with a hardworking, dedicated staff. There's an elevator, but it's impossible to avoid all the stairs. Although breakfast in your room is available, there's no way to reach the beautiful rooftop bar and breakfast terrace without climbing stairs. Those with bad knees, etc., should consider staying elsewhere. We had no complaint ourselves. The room was attractive and clean, if not more spacious than the average midrange european hotel. That is, we had a desk, but you had to push the chair in to get by when going around the huge bed-bigger than kingsize. There was one window with double glass. You could hear the garbage trucks, the noisiest things on the street, although you could not hear the crowds of tourists at all. We slept fine.The bathroom (with Jacuzzi that we didn't use) was more spacious, modern, and attractive. Like much of Italy, there's no shower curtain, but a glass partition kept 99% of the shower water in the tub. I strongly recommend that you stay here three nights, because you probably will then qualify for a free airport car pickup. We paid 55 Euros, and we enjoyed the luxury after a two-segment flight from the US. But because we were meeting a cruise ship, there was no way to stay more than 2 nights. The car to the Civitavecchia cruise port was 150 Euros (!), but that's the going rate for a trip three times as far as the airport, and no hope of a fare back for the driver. The managers also made two restaurant reservations for us in advance. We were pleased with all the staff we met. When the weather is wet, the breakfast room can be crowded, since many are reluctant to sit under the (huge) umbrellas on the terrace. An evening glass of wine (very reasonably priced) with complimentary heavy hors d'oeuvres is magnificent in the sunset. You have to look over the edge of the roof, and turn your head to see the Spanish Steps, however. (I'm not whining, just a matter of truth in advertising.) The location is excellent for attractions on this side of Rome. In particular, the Borghese and Barberini Galleries are walkable, as is The Trevi Fountain We did a sightseeing walk home from the Castel Sant'Angelo, through Piazza Navona, to the Pantheon, and the Trevi Fountain. But not everyone would want to walk that far. The Coliseum and ancient Rome are actually a shorter distance from the hotel than that walk added up to. Walking was cool in October, but you might want to use the Spagna subway stop on a sweltering summer day. I can't recommend the hotel at the full rack rate, but if you can get a discount, it's a worthwhile splurge. The rooms are not quite as charming as the hallways and public rooms, but our room was certainly quiet and comfortable. Our room was in excellent shape, and I wouldn't even describe it as \"dated\".

They placed a foam pad on the bed which helped to cushion the springs but I was rather disappointed overall with the size of the room, the furnishings and the amenities.

The biggest disappointment was we had specifically requested adjoining rooms since we were having 3 children stay in a room by themselves. I said this was a huge deal breaker for us if they could not accommodate us. They said they could but made us upgrade to a 100 euro, more expensive room. Well, I guess there is a little bit of a language difference on what adjoining/connecting rooms mean. These rooms were not connecting but next to each other. I was extremely disappointed. The rooms were fine and they did have the largest king size bed I have ever seen. It had to be 2 doubles pushed together. We could have easily had 4 if not 5 people in our room with the children, but they would only allow 3 max and 1/2 our bed went unused. The breakfast and hors d'oeuvres were good but you had to pay for the drinks including water, so they kind of get you with that. It was a nice idea though and customary in Europe.

The Inn's billing works in mysterious ways. We booked the stay several months in advance and were surprised to be immediately charged for the entire stay. When I inquired with the hotel via e-mail, they explained that the charge was just an authorization and would expire within two weeks, which it did. A few weeks before our arrival I checked the hotel's website to see if rates had gone down since the initial reservation. They had gone down dramatically, from 390 euro to 250 euro per night. Again, I contacted the hotel and they agreed to reduce the rate. Finding the hotel once you arrive in Rome isn't easy, it's hidden away and has only a tiny sign leading through a drab hallway to a small office - don't expect a lobby. The front desk personnel were warm and helpful on our initial two-night stay. Our room, in the \"View,\" on the top floor of a separate building, was relatively modern and had a lovely view over the Spanish Steps. Unfortunately, the ruckus from the Steps caused us a lot of lost sleep. The bed was more suited to a one-star hotel than one that commands nearly 400 euro a night. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the location, the wonderful terraces, and the friendly staff. We returned to Rome a few days later after a visit to Positano and the truly first-rate Le Sirenuse. We were greeted at the front desk with indifference and the staffer who had been helpful on the prior visit was quite unpleasant. We were stunned to learn that our room would cost the mysterious price of 340 euro, not the 250 the hotel agreed to, and not the initial 390. The front desk attendant said he had no record of the 250 rate and refused to honor it unless I had proof (even though we had just stayed there a few days prior). I emailed him the correspondence that mentioned the 250 rate and he said that only the manager could reduce the rate and we could discuss it when we checked out early the next morning. As it turned out the manager never appeared that morning, just a night attendant. Then there was the matter of our room on the second stay. This room, in the \"Inn\" proper, was small, dark, dingy, had no view whatsoever. The horrendous bed in that room made us nostalgic for the other lousy bed. The coup de gras was that our wake-up call the morning of check-out was a half-hour late. Our follow-up emails to the hotel haven't been returned. One last thing to be aware of - the hotel plays fast and loose with your credit card information. Expect them to take a huge authorization on your card and hold it for several weeks while also charging you for the stay once you check out. Apologies for the long message.

THE KEY TO STAYING AT THIS HOTEL if your going to, IS TO STAY IN THE HOTEL BUILDING NOT THE \"INN\" OR \"RESIDENCE\" BUILDING. There are really 2 buildings detached and the rooms are very different in each building. I stayed 2 nights, one in the Inn horrible and moved to the hotel building nice. It changed my rating from POOR to GOOD. 3) Since you are at the foot of the Spanish steps it continued to be noisey through the night with party goers.

We booked a great rate on the slh.com website. I highly recommend joining the SLH Club (free membership) because we received a room upgrade and several complimentary bottles of wine, fruit and Bulgari perfume during our stay. The entire hotel staff is very friendly and accommodating - from check in to check out. They made dinner reservations for us, provided maps and really went out of their way to make our stay in Rome perfect. You can't beat the location just a half block from the Spanish Steps down Via Condotti (amazing shopping)! There are countless restaurants within a few blocks. Our room had a lovely little terrace and several large windows. Our room faced the courtyard so it was very quiet. Breakfast is served on the top floor both inside and out in the beautiful rooftop garden. Breakfast consisted of juices, cereals, toast, eggs, pastries, fruit, meats and cheeses. In the afternoon there is a generous complimentary snack buffet consisting of everything from antipasti to cake to mini sandwiches. Each evening we would take the bottle of wine that the hotel had delivered to our room and brought it to the rooftop and enjoyed it with a few appetizers before dinner. Our room was a very nice large superior room with big windows that we opened a lot and a marble bathroom with shower and tub. Housekeeping came twice a day. There is a small elevator in the hotel but the stairs are very manageable. I highly recommend a drink not only in the hotel's rooftop garden but also walking up the Steps to the Hotel Eden and enjoying a cocktail at their rooftop bar - Bar La Terrazza. Stunning views of the sun setting over Rome! The drinks are pricey but well worth it! In summary, this is a fantastic deal in Rome when you add up all the little extras the hotel provides and the wonderful service!

We disputed it through Amex having been ignored by the hotel despite 3 telephone calls and numerous emails. The person to whom we were directed dint even work in that hotel and they refused to acknowledge us. Amex upheld our complaint. 3 months later, the hotel re-applied the charge and then claimed that the email I sent them had the wrong email address on it. This was odd - how would they know unless they received it? Likewise, it was the same address from which the notification of charges was sent! I have visited the Hotel to personally request a copy of their cancellation policy - they couldn't find one. The Hotel is in a fab location, though a little noisy.

The low-key entrance next to Prada was our \"secret\" escape route from the maddening crowds and it was always a pleasure to make it back to the hotel. In contrast to a number of the reviews on this site we had a great time at the Inn and received outstanding, friendly and professional service from Francesca and the rest of the team. Our room (315) was bigger than expected and while it had a few problems / quirks they did not detract from the stay in any significant way. We did not have a view (unless you wanted to open up the curtains and windows and look at the backside of adjoining buildings and their plumbing / air-conditioning) but if you stay at this hotel you should not be thinking about a view - when you understand where it (the hotel) is located and the claustrophobic nature of the average Roman street you will understand. Besides, the lack of natural light seemed to help us sleep really well. The room seemed to fall away from the bed slightly (it is in a 200 year old building ...) and while the bed was firm and comfortable and the decor stylish and luxurious there were a few problems with the period(?) furniture. The wardrobe was really struggling with the uneven floor and one door was very difficult to close and the whole thing seemed like it might fall on you but rather than get annoyed we just laughed at it (we called it \"character\"). There was no drawer space save for the two tiny bedside units. The bathroom was quite large with a good bath and shower and a nice size basin. Italian's seem to like bidet's but we didn't use it. The room was thoroughly serviced every day and they even changed the bed sheets daily. Breakfast is included in the rate and it was easily the best small hotel spread we've seen. The roof top terrace is a lovely relaxing way to start the day with table service for your tea or coffee (I recommend the \"american\" filtered coffee with hot frothed milk). The roof-top also doubles as a bar and sitting room (there is a comfortable inside section as well). They serve a reasonable amount of complimentary canapes every evening but the drinks seem a little over-priced (but subsequent bar / restaurant visits tempered that view). We were so tired one night we even ate upstairs from the limited room service menu which included a very nice lasagne. The hotel is exactly where you expect it to be - right at The Spanish Steps (which are perpetually crowded with tourists and hawkers) - we were speechless when our limo pushed it's way through the crowds past the Steps and into via dei Condotti. Get up early and you will have the steps (and the nearby Trevi Fountain) to yourselves. At 7am the average tourist is still in bed (or not so centrally located to start with) and even at 8:45am it was quiet. The Spagna metro station is right behind the Steps (good Gelato in the alley) and only a 1 euro ticket to Termini (main / central station) or even the Colosseum. There are buses that run down the Corso (down the other end of Via Condotti) - taxis can be hard to find (especially in a taxi strike like we encountered!!). There are many restaurants, bistros and bars nearby but the quality is variable - the one restaurant recommendation we solicited from hotel staff was ok but elsewhere it was very hit and miss. Same goes for coffee and gelato - look for establishments run by Italians and patronised by Italians as there are some rubbishy tourist traps. The shopping on Via dei Condotti is reserved for those who have money to burn - the Inn is next door to Prada, opposite Bulgari and there are all the other labels you could never afford as well. The good news is that there are more down to earth shops close at hand - head down to the Corso. But overall my wife found the shopping a bit disappointing and the quality and styles very hit and miss (much like the food).

I had really been looking forward to the Inn, based on the reviews I had read on Trip Advisor and my husband and I had decided to go for it, even though it was a bit pricey. On the plus side, the location is phenomenal with a fun atmosphere, surrounded by the ultra chic boutiques and Porsches cruising by. On the downside, I was a bit disappointed since we did not get any honeymoon upgrade like they advertise on their website--I know its based on availability but the place seemed empty but they claimed not to have any free rooms. So we were shown to what had to be the smallest room in the hotel, right next to the stairwell with a view of the backside of the elevator shaft and their air conditioning system. The really terrible thing was that the room had the distinct odor of raw sewage. I am from New Orleans originally and I know that smell, the aroma of the French Quarter, and it was definitely coming from somewhere in that room. I am not naturally a complainer and so didn't say anything because I thought maybe it was just me, but after leaving for the afternoon and returning--it really did reek. At that point though we had unpacked and it seemed like too much hassle to ask to move. To be fair, it was elegantly appointed with a fresco on the ceiling and a tiny but luxurious bathroom. Not a fan of jewelry catalogs on the bedside table-seems cheesy. The bed was rock-hard with scratchy sheets and a thin comforter that looked a little soiled. The breakfast room on the top floor is relaxing with a nice selection of goodies to choose from. It was winter so a little too chilly for the terrace, but it looked lovely. Their \"Evening Buffet\" is a racket designed I think to get rid of some of the food from breakfast and charge you close to 10 bucks fro a cappucino--not impressed by that at all. The waiter left the door to their kitchenette open the whole time we were snacking so I had the pleasure of watching the mini pizzas go into the microwave--kind of spoiled the atmosphere. All in all, I guess maybe we made the mistake of trying to go budget thinking that the cheapest room at the Inn would still be a luxury experience, but we were wrong. I'm sure if you have the really big bucks to shell out for one of the nicer rooms, your experience would probably be much different than ours.
