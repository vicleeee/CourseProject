WIth the subway you reach the central \"Puerta del Sol\" in under 10 minutes. In the surrounding streets there are multiple restaurants and bars, also a supermarket is only a few meters away. it really conveniently located for tourists visiting Madrid. Our room was surprisingly spacious for the location, also the bathroom is quite large and has windows, i.e. daylight. All was clean and comfortable, no complaints. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the committment they showed towards us was surely high class: Unfortunately we got robbed (in the city, not in the hotel) and they helped us calling and speaking to the police, agreeing on delayed payment (no money and no credit cards left :-( ) was also no problem at all, very good service! During the three days we stayed there we only dealt with staff that could speak very good english, we had no problems at all communicating though we don't speak any spanish at all.

It's so classic. Rooms are small and if you don't say anything you could finish in a room with a 135 cm bed (pretty small for these days).

Bad points: Timber flooring makes for a cold un-homely feeling and is extremely irritating when someone upstairs starts dragging the furniture around at 7:30 on a sunday. The heating, while it worked, sounded like an old car so we shut it off at night and froze. Television was only available in Spanish. CNN and BBC were available but it was impossible to change the Spanish dubbed american programs to VO like normal digital TVs The Location is not great for visiting the city, unless you need to take the Metro or Taxi to the centre Good Point(s): Free WiFi - It does seem though, that it is a 512K connection shared between the whole hotel (I tested it).

The staff are very friendly and helpful, and our lack of Spanish language skills was not a problem at all. The rooms are a good size, and the beds enormously comfortable, though perhaps a little modernising is needed there are no problems. The bathrooms are epic, and well equipped. Breakfast is a buffet, served from 8am to an impressive 11am with a great choice of pastries and hot food. In terms of location, its just a short and simple metro ride into the city centre (the metro costs 1euro a trip and is a 3 minute walk from the hotel. Top tips... leaving the hotel, follow the road to the right where you will find a great Italian restaurant (next to the amusingly named THONGS chinese). Hotel bar and mini bar prices are of course extortionate... BUT.... if you exit the hotel and turn left, follow the road past the chinese and to the italian, turn right and walk up the hill. Take your first left, and continue up the hill (five mins max) there is an internet cafe on the right and a SUPERMARKET on the left which sells everything you could need for a fraction of the price ! Finally... don't be caught out by the bars near the hotel, they charge upwards of 10 euros for a simple drink!

I would not recommend this hotel for those who speak no Spanish or who are picky about their hotels. The problems at this hotel may require that you speak with hotel staff frequently, sometimes daily, which may be more challenging for those with no knowledge of Spanish. The Good Some Service -- we had good service from a number of members of the hotel staff. We found the service to be particularly good in the restaurant and at times at the front desk, where some staff were very helpful to us on different occasions. Room and Bathroom -- Our room was nice and had hardwood floors. The bathroom was quite large with double sinks. The tub/shower was acceptable, although the glass pane blocking water did not work well. As a result, showers generally left the bathroom floor wet. The Bad We experienced a number of problems at the Hesperia Emperatriz: Internet -- the Internet service was often effectively nonfunctional during our stay. The hotel has free wifi, but the Internet service is at best really bad. If you are in town for business and need reliable Internet access, do not choose this hotel. If you want to browse websites or send email with any degree of predictability, do not choose this hotel. I waited on multiple occasions for consumer websites such as airline websites to load. These sites often did not load after 30 minutes or more of waiting. I had difficulty downloading and uploading documents and sending emails from my local email client and Gmail. At ti mes, the Internet service was a bit faster, but it was much slower than Internet access at places other than the hotel. Smoke -- our room, which were were told was on a non-smoking floor, frequently smelled like smoke. When we inquired at the front desk we were told that smoking was permitted on the third and sixth floors, which means that sometimes guests on other floors smelled smoke. If you are sensitive to smoke, this is probably not the best choice hotel for you. Housekeeping -- housekeeping was inconsistent during our stay. At times housekeeping was fine. At other times, some items were not provided. We did not have any towels one day and did not have any hand soap on another day. On some days housekeeping did not clear away dirty glasses. Room Keys -- We had to receive new room keys on 3 occasions during our stay because our previous keys stopped working.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood location, nice hotel though could do with an update\u201d", "Author": "Begonia21", "ReviewID": "UR45926868", "Content": "Recently stayed here for a 3 day business trip.

The hotel itself is well situated one block from the metro and a Starbucks, although the surrounding area is not particularly interesting. Some of the front desk staff were rather unfriendly and seemed to resent my speaking English or asking them to arrange restaurant reservations. There was an incident that was especially unprofessional: an older guest was standing just outside the front doors -- in plain view of the reception desk some 10 metres away -- with some large suitcases. She looked distressed and said she'd been waiting for a doorman to appear for 10-15 minutes to help hold open the heavy glass doors and pull her bags up the step and into the lobby. I went inside and interrupted chatting employees at the reception desk to inform them that this woman needed help... and I was waved away with \"Yes -- that's for the doorman\".
