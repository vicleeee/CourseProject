{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Dodgy Area. Ok for a quick stop only. My wife and I only stayed in Frankfurt for one night. Its only a stones throw from the railway station so don't bother about getting ripped off by a cab driver. The hotel is very average in all areas. Its architecture is very bland and so are the rooms and service. Ok for a quick stop over. Frankfurt is a beautiful city, a great blend of old architecture and modern skyscrapers. The inner city area is surrounded by a beautiful park. We were travelling back to the hotel on foot, just after leaving this park we had to walk through the Red Light district for about 400m. It was full of prostitutes and low-lifes, even in the late afternoon. We did not realise that this area is only about 150m from the Intercity Hotel. Be careful if you go for a walk.

I was staying at the InterCity for work, and having stayed previously at the InterContinental, it was of course always going to be different, but at half the cost it does represent good value. However......Check InVery long queue at check in as a large group was in front of me. This is a big hotel, with a very small check in desk. It took 30 minutes to reach the front of the queue. RoomDespite asking for an executive smoking room, on getting upstairs, it was clear that this was a non smoking floor. Don't get me wrong this is a good thing! For non smokers to be subjected to the stale rank smell of cigs is gross, so I asked to moved to a smoking floor. This was dealt with quickly and efficiently. The rooms are small, but well laid out...... just a bit tacky. Compare this to a Holiday Inn Express (same cost etc) and it just falls short. Old and slightly tired, woodchip on the walls, stains on the carpets. Having booked an exec room (same rooms but free wireless  minibar, bathrobe) none of this was available and therefore later, when I went on line having put on requested bath robe, had to get dressed and go to reception. The wireless just does not work. Could not logon at all and gave up. So, I took to my bed (twin room, very narrow single bed) only to realise that the mattress was PLASTIC!!!!!! This is completely horrible and resulted in my having a sweaty, and desperately uncomfortable night. Really really uncomfortable. I am neither incontinent nor a toddler and I felt slightly insulted about this. Only one, very flat pillow. The result? A complete failure by the hotel to provide me with what I was paying for..... a good nights sleep. NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE.A colleague had a really negative experience with the TV system. As there were no English channels, she signed in for Pay TV assuming it would be extra premium channels (Sky One, Comedy Channel, BBC etc) but was treated to a range of Porn. Take my word for it, she is no prude, but did not wish to pay for Porn she didn't want, but the hotel were totally intransigent about it. When I tried to sort this out at reception, another guest said he had had excactly the same issue. Please InterCity, all you have to do is list the Porn as Adult TV and you will not have angry, embarrassed guest demanding their money back to no avail!!Staff, breakfast  facilitiesStaff very polite at all times. Perfectly acceptable outdoor terrace with bar and large screen TV (football going on). Good breakfast choice, but room too small at busy periods and not refuelled efficiently. There is a gym and sauna, but I didn't try them out.LocationRight next to the station and walking distance to all of downtown Frankfurt.OverallI just can't stay somewhere twice where I cannot sleep. I was here to work..... and ended up feeling tired and not on form during meetings. Next time I will justify the extra cost and stay somewhere else.", "Date": "Jun 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR904198454", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "tryanythingonce"}, {"Content": "Avoid this hotel Yesterday I was in Frankfurt on business and was booked into the Intercity Hotel across from the train station. I only hope that the company saved money, because comfort was certainly not an issue.It is true that one hears no train noise. However, the noise inside the hotel is considerable. Doors banging, closets in the adjacent room opening, elephantine footsteps on the next floor, etc.I was given a room on the ground floor, where in case of fire the door to the bar/lobby is not allowed to be shut (I tried); ergo I was treated gratis to a concert of loud-mouthed drinkers until 1 a.m. To balance that out, the maids started rattling glassware, carts, etc., at 6:30 a.m. One of them tried to enter my room before 9 a.m. But the real kicker was the TV unexpectedly waking me at 6 a.m. I turned it off, fuming at a system which allowed the instructions of a previous guest to disturb my sleep. Unsuccessfully wooed Morpheus until 7:30 a.m. when the TV blared again. This time I called the receptionist, who, flustered, assured me someone would come to check. Thirty minutes later, having given up hope of succour and still gamely trying to rest, I received a call from the front desk saying I had neglected to press the OK button for a call left the previous evening, therefore the TV would continue to remind me. (At midnight when I entered my room, the omniscent TV had told me that a call had come. In vain I sought information from the TV and from the front desk. I was assured no call had come. Not true.)Even the manager attempted (admittedly, in not quite in so many words) to persuade me that these disturbances of sleep were my fault for having failed to press the OK button (also not true). Should I add that the remote control for the television was far from self-explanatory?Another colleague was awakened at 3 a.m.! But at least only once.I had to request that the soap containers be filled. No shower caps, shampoo, etc. Drains sluggish. Pillow was thin, although upon request an extra was provided. The A/C did work. The only other positive aspect was the not-quite-automatic offer of a free CombiTicket for public transportation. I received one at check-in, but other colleagues had to ask for it.One expects no better from the former proprietors of this hotel chain, but it is now owned and operated by the Steigenberger group.

The Intercity Hotel is a cozy, comfortable hotel in the heart of Frankfurt. I found the staff to be very helpful and pleasent. The rooms were small, but that seems to be standard for Europe.

I was unable to rectify this with the hotel, probably due to the laguage barrier (I cannot speak German at all). And I did not have a print out of my booking to prove what I was supposed to pay.

The location is superb, as the hotel is right outside of the Main train station. The staff at the hotel were friendly. The room was clean, but the carpeting could have used replacing.

In Frankfurt they have a group of drug dealers/users and Prostitutes. That being said, if you have to walk through them and you ignore them, they get on with what they are doing and don't seem to bother you. (or were we just lucky?)

KaiserStrasse has a few sex shops on it also, which enevitably attracts groups of Men so if you don't like the seedier side of life I suggest you stick to the U Bahn to head for the Zeil and main sites instead of walking.
