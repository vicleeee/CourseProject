Just been to the steak restaurant on the same street which is lovely (too shattered to walk any further after been out all day till six). And now sat watching tv in the room. We booked a privilege room (214)which is great and has tea making, dressing gowns slippers and a large bottle of water everyday - it was only a few euros more booked in advance on the Mercure site. Yes the walls aren't soundproofed ,it's an old building. Do wish they would get some better door closers on the rooms to stop them banging closed though - or only allow considerate guests to stay! We had breakfast at the bagel cafe and broodhuys, both great - broodhuys doesn't take cash and doesnt have any normal English breakfast tea though.

Stayed in room 112 which is a large room, with floor to ceiling double aspect windows, flooding the room with natural light... Lovely. Bathroom is compact, but everything is there and plenty of amenities which are topped up every day. We purchased a four day pass for the trams, and within a day realised how very very easy it is to use, and the fact the hotel is slightly further out than others, means that you have a really quiet night sleep. Everything is sparkling clean. The reception staff are polite and helpfull, and more than happy to provide you with information on where to go, helping us to print off our boarding passes ... We had their mini breakfast one day ... So we sat in their bar area and Amin (I think) served us in there. Very charming, if we wanted more coffee etc not a problem, just ask. I didn't like having the packet creamer on our coffee tray in our room, not a problem, within five minutes housekeeping presented me with a jug of milk to put in our fridge.

A great place to stop off at in late afternoon/early evening for an aperitif if you are returning to the hotel. The other place we liked was De Blauwe Hollander, Leidsekruisstraat 28. It serves typical Dutch food at a reasonable price and was packed when we went on Saturday night.

Room was on 3rd floor, facing over the street, at the front of the hotel. We'd booked a twin, but actually got a room with a large double and a single, so we had lots of room. Very impressed with the cleanliness and standard of housekeeping. The beds were supremely comfortable, and the ensuite, whilst compact, was modern, stylish and featured a large shower, with non-stop hot water and plenty of towels. Having read other reviews of the hotel, I'm surprised that people have complained about the noise. We heard nothing at all from neighbouring rooms, and could only occasionally hear doors closing further down the corridor - certainly nothing to cause a problem. The street is quiet. There is a school/nursery nearby, but the noise is only intermittent during the day, and, to be honest, it's a nice sound anyway. Location is terrific. Tram runs past end of the street but we pretty much walked everywhere. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the Oude Kerk and the same to walk to The Jewish Quarter or the Museum Quarter. You're just a few steps away from some of the prettiest stretches of canal. There's a large supermarket a block away with everything you might need and several cafes/ restaurants within very easy reach. The area felt very safe, even late at night. Reception staff extremely helpful and professional, and speak pretty impeccable English. They helped with directions, booking the airport shuttle etc. Only two downsides. (1) breakfast not inc and charged at approx 18 euros pp per day. We skipped this and got what we needed from the supermarket. (2) no tea tray in room but is offered at a rate of 5 euros a day. I thought this was a bit poor - it surely can't cost much to put a modest hospitality tray in the room and it's nice to be able to get a hot drink when you want it.

I fully accept that the hotel has no control over the building work, but it appears that the central heating problem is known to the owners. I know from my own experience of operational management that these things can be difficult to fix immediately, and the commendable staff changed my room without hesitation, but the fact remains I lost a whole night's sleep and, as that is the main point of a hotel, I feel I wasted my money and lost the enjoyment of a day's sightseeing through tiredness. I would have been very upset if I had only been staying one night and had a business appointment next day. Once the room was changed though, the noise - whilst still there - was bearable, and I was able to enjoy the very comfortable bed, good spacious shower and efficient, friendly service.

We booked a triple (3 single beds) and were given the keys to a 2nd foor room with 4 single beds. 4 beds were way too crowded for the room, but we managed by using one of the beds to hold our luggage, as there was no where else in the room/closet to put them - and we traveled with carry on size luggage. Below are my reflections on the items that matter to me when traveling: (1) Comfortable, clean, beds. Mecure gets a 5 star here. The beds were firm, the linens were clean and the style - white duvet was modern and up to date (2) Room furnishings. Mecure gets a 2 star here. Lights switches didn't match the sockets, no alarm clock, and furniture was old and hap hazzard. e.g. we had a rocking chair in a room, which was odd since that was the only place we could put something down on the floor (3) Bathroom. Mecure gets a 2 star here. The bathroom could only support one person as the shower did not have a curtain or door and the stahl was very tiny. No problems with hot water. Additionally, the toilet was located in the bathroom (as opposed to our other hotels with had sink/toilet in another room), which made it slow in the mornings as only one person could use at a time. Additionally they only provided one tiny bar of soap and one shampoo, and by the time the first person had finished showering, the soap had completely disintegrated. For those who use face cloths, they did not provide them. (4) Location. Mecure gets a 3 star. Located on a tiny side street (which is hard to find upon your first time to the hotel), one would think it would be quiet. Unfortunately not. There is a school on one side and the garbage trucks run the two perpendicular streets and were extremly loud upon pick up on Friday morning. Lastly, there is contruction going on at the other side of the hotel, so if you are close to a light sleeper, do not stay at this property. However, the location wasn't bad in terms of proximity to things we wanted to visit. (5) Transportation. Mecure gets a 4 star. From the airport, this property is easily accessible by 3 means of transportation: Taxi 45 Euro, Connexxtion Bus 16 Euro (easy!) or train/tram (16, 24, 25 - 5th stop to Wetering). For walking purposes it's a 10 minute walk to the museum district, or 20 minutes to the old city. You may also take the tram lines which are fairly easy to navigate, once you have your \"card\". Plenty of restaurants are close (6) Service. Mecure gets a 3 star. There was always one staff person at the desk, so typically you had to wait your turn. They were friendly and courteous, althought they certainly didn't go out of their way. There is no concierge, so you're limited to the map they provided and the word of the staff. (7) Price. Mecure gets a 2 star. Under normal circumstances, we overpaid for our room. However, we booked in October for a December Xmas stay, so figured we had paid more to support the holiday week. Would have given it another star if the rates weren't off from what was received. (8) Food. We never ate breakfast at the hotel, but they did offer breakfast for 20 euros per person. Overall this property fits the description on their website.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paignton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Twixmas Break\u201d", "Author": "Bowler10033", "ReviewID": "UR122359405", "Content": "Have just returned from a great stay at this hotel.

Breakfast, which was included in our package price, was exceptional. Freshly squeezed orange juice, cereals, cheeses, hams, pates, fresh fruit, all kinds of fresh bread as well as scrambled eggs and bacon. You could also order freshly cooked fried eggs if you preferred. Being English, I do like tea/coffee facilities in the room which are not provided.

We got to the hotel at about 11am but check in is not until 2pm which we were aware of and so we basically checked in minus getting shown to our rooms. The receptionist then allowed us to store our bags for the day which was extremely helpful The reception is beautifully decorated, very chic and unique but elegant.

Similarly the bathrooms which are fairly new and have stylish modern fixtures but there are no bathtubs, just shower stalls. In the case of Room 325 the sloping ceiling, besides posing the risk of head injury especially in the dark, detracts further from the already limited space making it literally a very tight fit. We'd be inclined to decline this room in future should the occasion arise.. There is an attractive small bar next to the breakfast room in the basement but we did not have the chance to try it. The piece de resistance at breakfast besides the extensive buffet is the self-serve orange juicer which squeezes the fresh fruit on command, an unusual but welcome feature. There is also a self-serve hot beverage machine which dispenses various types of coffee in addition to hot water. Altogether the quality/quantity of the breakfast provided is very good so when booking it'd be advisable to select the breakfast inclusive rate otherwise the charge is quite high.

Plan those trips to the bathroom accordingly). My room may have been the only one in the hotel with this arrangement. Or not. They didn't tell me. If they had asked whether I wanted the climb-to-the-bathroom-room I probably would have declined. I also would have had a lot less beer the first evening I was there.

It is located very close to the outset of the three main canals that encompass the centre of Amsterdam. The Museum Van Loon is a 5 minute walk away and the Heineken Experience is about 10 minutes walk away. Dam Square and the oldest part of the city are about a 20-30 minute walk from the hotel. There is, however, a tram stop located almost outside the hotel if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fancy the walk. The rooms look like they have been re-decorated in the past few years. They are contemporary, although perhaps a little dark, given that the lights in the room do not give out much light and the walls were painted in dark blue. This is not a problem during the day though because the large windows let in plenty of natural light. There are flat screen TVs in the rooms, mini-bars and a safe. But there are no tea/coffee making facilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c these have to be paid for at the rate of 5 Euros each day, if you want that facility. WiFi is also extra, just under 6 Euros each day, if you require it. The rooms are perhaps a little small by European standards, For instance, if sitting at the desk to work, the back of the chair pushes up against the end of the bed, which makes it difficult to sit down and get up from the chair. On the other hand, the bathroom is quite large \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is no bath but there is a shower. Whilst decorated nicely, the hotel could have put a little more thought into practicalities, e.g. the space for sitting at the desk, or providing a soap dish in the bathroom, or providing more adequate room lighting. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet included a wide selection of continental foods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c croissants and pastries, cereals, breads, cold meats and cheese, a cappuccino/espresso/latte machine, fruits etc. It is also possible to request scrambled or fried eggs at no extra cost. Breakfast is served from 6:30-10:00am each morning, which is helpful. Unfortunately, my stay was let down greatly by the building work opposite the hotel, on a private piece of land. I was awoken each morning of the 3 nights I stayed at the hotel, at 7am, by the noise of clunking metal being dropped into skips and the sounds of heavy machinery. See my photos and video for how bad this was. I chose the hotel for its otherwise quiet location. If I knew I would be awoken each morning by building work, I would not have stayed here. The receptionist did not now how much longer the building work would be continuing for. From the look of it, it will be ongoing until at least, January 2011, but I suggest you contact the hotel about this, prior to booking. Also, the walls between rooms seem thin because it was possible to hear the people in the rooms either side of me talking at night and/or their televisions. I have tried to review this hotel without being biased towards the issue of the building work. I acknowledge that the building work will stop at some point in the future. However, given the rack rate for this hotel is around 240 Euros, and that it is only a 3* hotel and there are a few issues with the size of the room and thin walls etc., I have rated the hotel accordingly. My main advice is if you really want to stay here, then please check with the hotel before booking, about the building work opposite.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "carol_trower", "ReviewID": "UR85284075", "Content": "This charming hotel in a quiet mews near many attractions, excelled in all areas.

Also, the cleanliness of the room is outstanding, can't fault it, and the decor in the bathroom is quite funky. But that's where the positives end, unfortunately. I was given room 230, and it was absolutely tiny. I am by no means big, but if I sat at the desk I couldn't even get my legs under it, or if I didn't want them squeezed the chair would be squished against the bed. No space to put anything, and while not claustrophobic, I certainly found it lacking severely in space. I was also very disappointed to find not a single room had a bath, they only had showers. The room itself was looking out to a concrete wall across and the garbage below, not pleasant at all. Also, the room was next to the service stairs, or service lift, and until late at night and early in the morning this would create a lot of noise, the walls in the rooms are very thin so you can hear everything. The bed was amazingly comfortable, but due to all this noise (also from the rubbish when it was being chucked out) sleep wasn't comfortable. Also, if you have the hotel keycard next to your iPhone, expect to go back to reception as somehow it resets it! I went down to say it wasn't working, but nobody checked my name against the reservation, they just asked me my room number and off I went again. Not particularly secure.

The sink had a nice delft tile like design, same as the wall tiles above the toilet. The shower was decent sized, never ran out of hot water, and had moderate water pressure. Mercure supplies you with plenty of toiletires so there is no need to bring soap or shampoo. The only downfall I found with the hotel room was the lack of free Wi-Fi access. In fact Wi-FI or cabled internet access is crazy expensive at the hotel, I think around $17US for three hours of Wi-FI (you can have multiple sessions that add to three hours or use it all at once). If you don't want to pay for internet access there is a free workstation in the lobby where you can easily check email or look up anything you may need to know while staying at the hotel. Some people's reviews have mentioned the reception staff being rude or not friendly but I found the exact opposite. Hans (on the desk in the morning) in particular was cool -- with a witty sense of humor and the ability to speak a million languages what's not to like about him. The other two reception staffer's that I sopke with were helpful, they anwsered all my questions and filled any requests that I made during my stay. I didn't have breakfast in the hotel as I'm more of a coffee and pastry person in the morning so big breakfasts are wasted on me.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco,CA", "Title": "\u201cLow key.

She was not kind with any of the following guests, including us. Guests in front of us were Gold members and asked for an upgrade. She replied with a straight rude 'no ugrade, sorry'. We asked for a basic info, she replied she did not know. Rooms are good and modern, positions was excellent, in the middle of some of the nicest canals. At check-out, again, a receptionist, this time a loud man, was rude to a guest that complained about high extra charges. Apparently they charge EUR 20 for parking, EUR 5 for internet., EUR 10 for coffe in the room. Again only 1 receptionist and 6 guests checking out. Some guests wanted lo leave baggages at the hotel for a while. Considering the queue, the receptionist could have collected them, and deposit them later. On the contrary he rudely inticated the way to the guests, left the reception, and went with them to a store room very far away. When he came back, looking quite distressed and upset that the queue was getting longer, he entered a room, to exit after a minute. He kept speaking so loud that everybody could hear all other guests: name, surname, details of nights stayed, minibar, movies watched. In short Agreable hotel, but AWFULLY RUDE reception staff.

Trams 16, 24, 25 run from close by to city centre tickets can be purchased from most shops. Trams are every few minuets, so you are never waiting around for long. On arriving at Schiphol airport, and not knowing our way around, we went to the tourist information desk and bought a return ticket for the shuttle bus, which took us right to our hotel. If you have never been to Amsterdam before like us, then I can recommend you use this or you may never know how to get to the hotel. For 19 euros it was easy. The hotel staff are all very helpful and polite, the rooms are basic and well maintained, and not bad size wise, which were cleaned every day. They have a free safe deposit box, T V with some English channels as well as Dutch. The bathrooms are average in size with shower, however the showers do not have doors, and water goes all over the bathroom floor unless you turn the shower head against the wall, but there is always plenty of hot water. Continental breakfast, with a good variety on offer. Part of the hotel is none smoking, which suited us fine. You must buy a good map, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rely on the small free maps that are given away.

Many of the guests seemed to have little regard for others' sleep; there was lots of hollering out in the hall. The windows could use improvement, as even on the quiet street we faced, there were motorists and drunken revelers passing by in the wee hours of the night. While some of the desk clerks we encountered there were helpful and professional, one was downright rude about giving directions to the VanGogh museum upon our arrival and another was curt and impatient. Breakfast was just so-so; we only ate there once and preferred to walk to Village Bagel on the main street. Unfortunately, the main street leading to Noordestraat was all torn up and under construction, which gave our approach to the property an industrial, unpleasant feel.

We were allocated Room 108 which we suspect normally had two single beds but the management had put in a roll-away bed as well. All the beds were fine and comfortable. Linen was changed for the third night. There were some cobwebs and dust visible on the high picture rail, quite a few marks on the walls (from suitcases?) and grubby paintwork around the light switches. All this made the room look a little worn and shabby. The air conditioner didn't seem to cool the room, just blow air around on what was a temperature record breaking weekend (27C). The clean, bright bathroom was huge with a proper full-size bath tub with over-bath shower. The sink/vanity unit was okay, and the towels were clean, fluffy and changed every day. The free in-room safe was a good asset. The mini-bar was well stocked, but the contents didn't entirely match the printed list. There is no tea/coffee making facility in the room. From previous reviews we elected not to use the expensive hotel breakfast bar but to eat at a small cafe a few hundred meters south of the hotel on the main road - that was fine. The bagel cafe mentioned in reviews looked good. Note that the Persian restaurant (the Teheran) mentioned in previous reviews is now closed and looking very derelict. Staff were helpful in providing maps and calling taxis. Although not in the downtown central area it is generally within walking distance of most tourist sights, and easily accessible using the 16, 24 and 25 trams from/to Centraal Station.

Clean and quiet neighborhood. We used trams No 16, 24 and 25 in and out all day (trams stop at Wettering Cirquit which is a 2 minute walk from the hotel). You should buy a - 24h or 48h or 72h - discount pass (available at Central Station) because it saves you a lot and can also be used for buses (including night bus). Breakfast is continental buffet and we felt it is overpriced for EUR15 pp per day - even if they can serve it to your room. Try walking to the bagel corner spot which is 3 blocks north, on your way to downtown - locals feel at home there, you should too. Or, walking south, try breakfast at the caroussel right on the Wettering Cirquit, you cant miss it. In other words, if you really dont need breakfast in bed, then there is something for you within walking distance. We are satisfied with the reception desk service. They will spend time with you to make sure you are happy with the information, they will offer alternatives and book almost anything for you. They will store your luggage if you need that on your last day. When we brought in an applepie and asked for utensils they responded in no time. The room (we stayed at 222 non-smoking) was clean - and they kept it that way. Room temp was fine, we never felt cold. It was rather small but we never felt we needed more space. The mini-bar was ok and fairly priced. No problem with the bed. Bathroom has no tub, but 24hour hot water plus bath amenities make up for that. Good space for your clothes. Also, laundry service availability - at a charge. Free safe, we liked that. Not much of a room view, but we did not care for that. TV with limited options but who visits Amsterdam for that. There is no restaurant in the hotel. There is a steakhouse right outside with very tasty food, but the steaks couldnt get any smaller - prices ok though. The persian restaurant nextdoors offers much more for less and surprizing good quality, we would eat there again on any casual occassion. Good reasturants you will also find near the meusem square. You will notice a very small pastry shop on your right, just around the corner, walking north to downtown. It is considered one of Amsterdams best. Do buy sth, you wont regret it, all those locals flocking in every afternoon cant be that wrong. In Amsterdam, do take some time to visit the south part of the city (city meaning the greater Amsterdam area, not just the centre, buy yourself a real map), the most expensive real estate there, along a great park with lakes. You will be happy to lose the bar scene and coffee shop picture that so wrongly profiles this city and notice Dutch people on their daily activities - we felt they are lively people with broad interests and we were very happy to have met some of them. Outside the city, take a tour or two to the country, yes it is pricey but - hey- you get to be part of the real country for a change.

Once you arrive in Amsterdam Central train station go to the front of the station and take tram number 24. This tram will take you to Wetering Circle which is where you will get out. Do not stop at Kerkestraat(sp) it is much further. The reason is that there has been a tram eliminated (no 25) from service due to the construction on a new part of the metro system. This construction is due to last until 2011. Once you get out at Wetering Circle backtrack one street. Look down the avenue and you will see the Mercure sign - it truly was easy to find. I would not suggest having a car - there are only 6 spaces in front of the hotel. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. They are able to book \"Key Tours\" from the hotel desk. This was very nice as we did the \"Dutch Countryside Tour\". It was a six hour tour. My suggestion is that if you have a day - do the Grand Holland Tour - it is 8 hours and includes the Delft, Rotterdam, Hague. The hotel rooms are small - but typical Europe size. About 10x10 plus the bath. There are no washclots so if you use one - you should bring your own. The room was very clean. The showers have no doors so the floor tends to get a little wet if you point the sprayer in the wrong direction. The hairdryer worked great - which is unusual for a hotel. We were in room 302 and it was pretty quiet - we had another relative traveling with us - in room 307 and he said it was noisy all night long, doors slamming and people yelling. With regards to the breakfast - they have a continental breakfast at the hotel. It is really not worth the 15 Euro they charge. However, there isn't much close around for breakfast so we had it 2 mornings. There is cold cereal, juice, coffee, pastries, coldcuts and cheese, fruit on one morning. They will make you eggs - you have to specify what kind. They are mediocre at best. The front desk will sell you 48 hour tram passes, they are a good deal - unless you buy a strippenkart from the bookstore at central station.

I travel a lot with my job and stay in a lot of hotels, most of which are the modern ones I mention. I don't find anything wrong with them, but I find this one very charming. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, the rooms are comfortable, the mini-bar is great value (and has chocolate and crisps in it, yum), very well located (although I would have to rely on the others on here, as I only go to my office and back)! They do a breakfast, and I always have this brought up to my room - they are incredibly prompt with it and it's the traditional continental breakfast - a couple of rolls, cheese, ham, croissant, jams, apple, yoghurt etc, but always does the trick for me. They also have BBC1 and 2 on, tragic of me to be so concerned I know, but especially if you're away on business on your own it can be very helpful to know these things!

Incidentally, the area is very quiet as it's a residential area, but if you do want to make sure, ask for a room which doesn't overlook the car park, it's only small but it's where the main doors are so you will hear people coming back from nights out etc. 2 restaurants within 1 minutes walk - a steakhouse (very popular) and a Persian restaurant next door to it - went in here one day because the steakhouse was full and have been going back ever since - great food and service.", "Date": "May 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cLovely and quiet location\u201d", "Author": "only1eebo", "ReviewID": "UR4984258", "Content": "I would agree with most of what the previous reviewer has commented on.
