There is no cars. The night lights are dim and mystical. When you arrive at the Santa Lucia train station at night see you find yourself on an ordinary European train station. You go out and your heart jumps a few beats. The ethereal city is hung in the air across the Grand Canale. This is Santa Croce borough (siestere) over there and the Capri hotel is there too, very Venetianly hiding itself in a maze of narrow alleys but only a few dozen meters from the waterfront. The hotel is very very close to the Piazzale Roma bus station (take the bus to the Marco Polo airport from there) and to the Santa Lucia train station (for Verona or Padova or Milano or other places in nearby Europe). Remember ther is no cars? Waterbus won't help you to get there from the train station, so it's very good that the walk with the luggage is short. Perfect. Closer to the train or bus station it would be too many people around. Carlton Capri is isolated but very near to a main footway across the islands to the major tourist borough, San Marco. It is a good walk though, so if you don't feel like walking you have to cross the bridge to the train satation (ferrovia) and take a vaporetto. Bloody expensive, those things are. I'd prefer walk anytime of day: you see so much around and it's impossible to loose your bearings because there a post showing you directions just everywhere. That the location. The hotel itself is great. The breakfast is great. Cofffe absolutely the best I tasted at any hotel anywhere.The stuff friendly. Rooms are high ceilinged. The bathroom is fairly big by European standards, room sized more or less regularly. Would be just perfect but the heating/airconditiong ducts were giving me some low volume but constant noise (this is just me being very light sleeper, I gather most of the people won't even notice this noise). Wi-Fi was free but the signal was very weak on the 1st floor, usable in the lobby. Also I would say this hotel is rather overpriced but for Venice normal values could not be applied, so ther it may be even considered budget. I was there in February, it was chilly outside but always warm inside. Can't say what happens in summer when Venice air becomes unbearable. Highly recommended. Very convenient for getting to/from the airport.

The location is very convenient and clean. Across from the Train stn. Along, but behind the Grand Canal. Piazale Roma is so close, it's where you can catch the bus to the airport ; only 5 Euros/person! A good 30 minute walk to San Marco and Rialto Bridge. Vaporetti is very expensive 6E each way. Day pass is good 13E /p that way you can hop on and off . Note: if you plan on staying longer than a week or you are doing a lot of vaporetting, then go to the bus stn -piazale Roma and fill out some form and that will allow you to pay 1.25 E for each way. I wondered how the locals paid 6E each way each time. Btw, on the day pass you can go to Lido and take a local bus from there- all on the pass .That way you can rest your feet and let the bus take you around; because in Venice you will be climbing a lot of bridges and your legs will beg for rest. Hotel: Staff were helpful...Stefano and Ricardo were helpful. Our room was not producing cool AC, we had to request for a fan..which was finally given to us. Our sleep was being affected drastically. Room: Clean, Comfortable for 3 of us...albeit a bit small. Toilette was immaculate as well with toilettries and bidet. Breakfast : Room was a bit too cosy for liking. Food items plenty, ample and fulfilling. Heathy choices, eggs, bacon, ham, cheese, etc. Coffee pot was placed at your table. Cappucino was provided cheerfully on request -no extra charge.

It is extremely close to the Train Station and all the Water Bus stops, which is no more than a three minute walk. We had no issues finding the hotel, I will admit before we left for Italy I used Google Maps to get a better view of the Hotel and mapped out our route from the airport which worked out great for us and we got there in no time at all. The map the Hotel email's to you will also do just as good. Upon arriving at the Hotel we had a very friendly greeting and the Concierge gave us a City Map, although I still stuck with the Street Wise map that we picked up at a local Barnes and Noble. The Concierge was very helpful and gave us great information and recommendations from their personal take on places to eat according to our price range, they also gave us the best place to catch a Gondola ride, and even looked up the train schedule for us. The hotel does offer free Wi-Fi in their lobby in case you have a Wi-Fi enabled device. The room we had was a good size although when I saw another room it did appear smaller than ours, they come equipped with the basic Fridge, Safe, Hair Dryer, Hot Rack for Towels, and Satellite TV \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in Italian\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There is not an Iron in the rooms since it poses a Fire Hazard to have them in the rooms but they do offer a service for cloths if you would like that done. Things that are just around the bend from the Hotel is a Laundry Mat, Internet Caf\u00c3\u00a9, Tabacchi shop \u00e2\u20ac\u0153which is like your local convenience store\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, ATM and a playground for the kids. At a further walk \u00e2\u20ac\u0153about 5mins\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the Car parking lot you can find a Post Office and a small little Grocery store. We were really happy with the location of this Hotel it is off the Grand Canal which was great since it got us away from all the tourist traffic and the noise from all the boats which make noise and honk like a busy highway, it was tucked away in a very nice and peaceful spot. Their continental breakfast was very nice with a wide variety of foods to choose from and well worth to catch each day. While speaking of food there are plenty of places to dine just a short walk from the hotel for both Lunch and Dinner. Also if you get the late night munchies or just want a quick bite to eat there are places near the Train station that are open late. We arrived on the 19th of October and checked out on the 26th when we arrived the A/C was turned off and the Heat was on, there is a thermostat in the room to control the heat or you can turn it off and open up the window. The beds were very comfortable we had a Queen size bed that was made up of two twins locked together, you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even tell that they were twins it felt the same through the whole bed and the seam connecting the two in the middle seemed like it wasn't even there that it was just one big bed.

We were pointed in the direction of a room that was n the ground floor between the toilets, the kitchen, the breakfast room and the little courtyard where staff put all the bins. Needless to say we asked for another room, but I was told by the receptionist that they were fully booked. Our sleep was interrupted by the air conditioning making a very loud buzzing noise (like an alarm) in the night - I sleep with ear plugs and don't normally have any problems with noises, but I had to get up, turn the air con off, then on again to get it to stop. Then the next morning, staff preparing the breakfast from about 6:30 again woke us. This was unavoidable, but the room should not really be used, it's the only one on the ground floor, and we could literally hear cutlery being laid on the table while showering! Breakfast was fine, checkout again fine, but I wouldn't really recommend the hotel. The staff's attitude could have made a big difference to this stay.

I had previously stayed in Venice at a much more expensive hotel on the Grand Canal which turned out to be a major rip off. This time after many hours of research decided upon booking 2 balcony rooms at the Carlton Capri. Directions as per website were accurate or should I say only involved one wrong turn and a request from the Sister Hotel Carlton for directions. We were only 3ft away from our intended alley and we were there. Reception greeted us warmly and we were directed to our balcony rooms via a lift and then stairs. No mean feat with large suitcases but very achievable. Rooms were lovely, Room 212 I think was ours, great size, large double bed, well equiped bathroom and the balcony overlooking other apartments but furnished with little table and 2 chairs and pretty flowers. The only night on our whole month long trip it rained it rained that night rendering my lovely little balcony unusable. Bed very comfortable and no complaints about noise issues at all. I must say, the only balcony rooms were on this upper floor and seeing as our friends were in the other had no problems at all. Breakfast room smallish but seemed to cope with the many guests and was attended by very friendly accommodating ladies who made sure coffee/tea was served to your table on entry and all food was replenished as per usage.

We had the most fun trying to see the sights and getting lost in all of the alley/walkways over and around all of the canals. Finding the Carlton Capri after 12 hours of flight time was hysterical for the first of our party of 11 when they arrived in Venice. Fortunately, they met us at the bus stop:Piazzale Roma and showed us the way. You can also take a train from the airport. The train station in Venice (stazione ferroviaria) is just up the Grand Canal from the bus stop. As the crow flies...Hotel Carlton Capri is across the Grand Canal from the train station, but behind some buildings in the Santa Croce section of Venice. This is different from the Hotel Carlton and Grand Canal which is right on the Grand Canal. You'd be best to ask directions once you get across the Grand Canal. However, if you can find the very small alleyway that starts on the other side of the Grand Canal: Calle del Bergamaschi..take it and then turn at the first right. Carlton Capri should be right there. Even the smallest of side alleys in Venice had a stenciled name up on the buildings. Once we were acclimated, we helped many lost looking people rolling their luggage behind them when we were near the hotel...it was too obvious. Speaking of luggage...make sure the wheels are in good shape because from the bus stop, you'll need to go over a minimum of 2 bridges with steps before getting to the hotel. The hotel itself was small and quaint. It was very clean and our desk clerk was very accommodating. The room keys were awesome. You leave them with the desk clerk when you go out. Our breakfast was above average.

To get there take the bus from Marco Polo for 6 Euros (very nice bus and not a hassle at all). When you get off the bus you will see a big yellow sign that says \"S. ROCCO FRARI RIALTO\". Go under that sign...keep on that path, you will cross a bridge. Once over the brigde, keep to the left and you will cross one more bridge. Then keep left along the canal. Take the second alley on the right hand side. The hotel is down the alley on the left hand side. The bridges have stairs that you have to carry your suitcases over. I would not recommend going to its sister hotel...much more expensive even with a 10% discount. We went for drinks. For two shirley temples it was 23 Euros and not worth it at all. We were bombarded with guys selling roses and guys playing acordians..they all wanted money. We also went for dinner and it wasn't great either. There is a great place if you go out the way you came, turn left along the canal...called Ribbot. Good restaurant. Also lots of little coffee shops all through Venice. Would only recommend a day or two in Venice...very confusing and touristy, but still worth a short visit. In Italy smoking is everywhere and smokers are not worried about blowing it in your face or throwing their butts on the ground or in the water.

It is set behind the hotel on the Grand Canal. It's nice and quiet and away from all the bustle of tourists and boats. You're literally in the midst of peoples homes so when you walk out you really get a feel of being part of that neighborhood. The one drawback is that you don't get a view of the canals or anything but the trade off is a nice quiet area and home feel. I didn't think I would like that before coming but once we were there and looking back it really was a great location. It was close to the train station, just a walk over the bridge and directly across. You can catch water taxis and ferries nearby. It's about a 30 minute ride by ferry to San Marco and maybe about that long if you walk (and don't get lost along the way). The hotel itself is nice and elegant. It's clean and the staff is wonderful and accommodating. The rooms are spacious and bathrooms full of marble and quite roomy. They have air conditioning so it was nice to have to escape the heat and humidity and especially to keep the windows closed from mosquitoes. They have a mosquito repellent plugged into the socket but it didn't seem to help as much as me going and buying a spray and taking care of it instantly. After that, the room was excellent. The halls are a little hollow and sound resonates. I could tell when our neighbors across the hall came back, but that was a minor thing. At least we didn't have traffic noise or anything. Breakfast is served in a nice breakfast room with the usual spread of fruits, bread, eggs, cereal, yogurt, juices, and coffee. There is plenty of shopping and dining nearby. Take a stroll in any direction and you're bound to run into a great place to eat or buy souvenirs. Walking around Venezia can be confusing but you'll find getting lost is a great way to find some nice, quiet nooks and crannies in the city. Looking back I'm glad we were at this location and not somewhere near the bustle of San Marco. After walking all over the city it was nice to come back to such a quiet place and walking down the alley to get to it really made it seem as if we were staying in that area and not just entering the front of another busy hotel.

For starters, we did request a balcony room (which from what i can tell, there is only one), and they gave that to us which was very nice. The rooms were spacey but the bathroom was nothing special. Our main complaints come with the service of this hotel. To start, there was a hidden window in our bathroom that was open our first night, when we woke up in the morning the room was full of mosquitos and we had bug bites all over our bodies. After finding the window in the bathroom, which was behind the two curtains in the bathroom, we closed it. The maid, after cleaning our room, proceeded to open the window again, which was completely not necessary. Well needless to say, we did not realize the window was opened again and woke up again with a room full of mosquitos. To the staff, all 3 staff members we dealth with were extremely rude. Being an American that frequents Italy often enough to understand they appreciate attempts to speak the language, this hotel staff was not welcoming or helpful at all. We asked the hotel staff for directions and about the bus service they advertise on the front desk and the staff member gave a one word response while playing on his phone. These are mild complaints but we definitely would not stay at this hotel again and there are surely better hotels then this hotel which is hard to find although close to the train station, and beware, because the gate on the grand canal is locked at night and you need to walk around through some dark alleys.

Arriving late at t the bus station the hotel was within a few minutes walk - if you know where to find it. It is down what looks to be a small alleyway and if you've not experienced the narrow streets of Venice, chances are you won't realise there's anything down there never mind a hotel. We had to ask at their sister hotel on the canal. However once you find it the hotel is clean, bright and cosy with a welcoming reception area. Our room was very good with a great, well appointed clean and spacious bathroom and highly efficient plumbing and shower. The bed was spacious and very comfortable. We were pleasantly surprised by size of the room and especially the bathroom. Furnishings and fittings were good quality and it was well decorated and appealing. Throughout our stay all the staff were super efficient and friendly. The lady managing the breakfast room in particular was a lesson in how to run a hotel , with super fast and friendly morning service. You have to be realistic - Venice is a cramped city where goods have to be hand barowed through the streets and the hotel soundproofing is not great so there is noise on a morning and you may hear other guests, tv etc. The breakfasts fall in to the slightly strange (to English tastebuds) continental category but offered plentiful food and good coffee in a very nice room. Take your own tea bags though - Italian tea bags generally aren't brilliant. The rather liquid scrambled egg bemused my partner but when in Italy..... The breakfast hours were very accommodating. The hotel is close to vaporetto stops, the bus station and given the size of venice, it is easy to walk or get the vaporetto to all the key sites. There are a lot of excellent trattoria's, small bars and shops nearby. The area is very quiet at night - don't be put off by the graffitti tags which are endemic to venice, its safe to wander the narrow streets. Arriving after 10pm we were directed to an excellent small restaurant round the corner that was open past midnight with great pizza and home made pasta. Given the astronomical cost of living and eating in venice it pays to eat local and away from St. Mark's square. We were not due to fly until the evening on our last day and the hotel couldn't have been more accommodating in looking after our luggage so we could collect it on the way to the bus station. All in all we were pleasantly surprised and very pleased we had stopped at the Carlton Capri.
