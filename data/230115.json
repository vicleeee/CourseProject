Also there is a lovely outside dining area looking over a pond. A small fitness centre has just been added. The hotel is opposite a large park, garden and lake recreational area. This area makes a very pleasant area for a walk or bike ride. However there seems to be a lot of men going in and out of the park, into the bush off the pathways, and stopping in car park in front of park.

The bus is number 197. Buy a day pass it is cheaper.

For the price-conscious, I found a better rate here than at Accor's lower-tier Ibis and Etap properties when using my company's client code. Those with a car can appreciate the parking options across the road and the proximity to major highways. For the car-less who want a nice room at a good rate, though, there remains the issue of location: halfway between the airport and the city. That's not entirely a bad thing, though. If you're doing business with ACN, IBM, NCR, PWC or others with offices in SW Amsterdam, you're very close. In the summer, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re steps away from a small beach and a lovely wooded area. Just down the road, you can board a number of suburban bus lines (I don't think they accept the GVB day-card); the trick is to know exactly when they arrive and where they're going. However, if you're willing to walk 15 minutes to the north to Nieuw Sloten, you can access good restaurants, supermarkets and Tram 2 to Vondelpark, Leidesplein and Central Station; check it out on Google Maps, and be sure to walk on the pedestrian/bike path, not the roadway! You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll reach many city destinations faster and cheaper this way than by using the airport shuttle and rail service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re dressed for the weather and the walking. But the quickest and most authentic way to roam the city \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or nearby countryside -- is by bicycle, and the hotel has a few available for rental. Liability is limited to 100 Euro; two locks are supplied. Follow the bike path to Amsterdam via the Nieuwe Meer locks, a sight in itself. A few other notes: the odd-numbered rooms face a charming quiet pond while the even-numbered rooms face a busy road and rail corridor. There is a lift way down the hallway; rooms offer a free safe and a small refrigerator stocked with pricey beverages and snacks. Various room media options exist either for for free or fee; two free internet terminals (with printer!) in the lobby operate virtually 24 hours. I also appreciated something I've not seen before in my budget travels: a bedside switch for all room lights!

A bus stops outside for a 3 euro trip to the centre of Amsterdam. The first two nights we ate in the hotel restaurant. The food was very good although the choice was limited. This was explained because they had an unprecidented run on stranded passengers arriving at the hotel. In spite of our uncertain situation we spent a pleasant 4 nights at the Mercure and would like to come back to Amsterdam in more relaxed circumstances and would most likely choose this hotel particularly because of its location as obviously a city centre hotel would be more expensive.

On the other hand, the position is not amazing at all, facing the Highway and being far from everything else. The building is modern and quite quiet, despite the works they were doing in that period. It has no character and it is very anonymous: a typical resort for business people in hurry. I didn't find a lift. The basicly furnished room was clean, as well as the bathroom. Much better if you have a car (large parking), so you can reach a restaurant different from the one offered by the Hotel. I had not a good experience here: heavy food for too high prices. A very good and rich breakfast compensated my disappointment for the evening dinner. The staff was quite friendly and available to give information. I did appreciated the computer station with free internet connection. It is nice the quiet meadow with a pond in the middle. The check-in was good and fast. The check-out was a bit complicated because of a problem with the voucher released by the travel agency.
