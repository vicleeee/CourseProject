The treatment I received from Se\u00f1ora Sole at the front desk was very curt as she shunned me off to one of the other staff, who fortunately were much nicer. I had been told by the airline that it was better if left my bags checked in at the airport for the next flight rather than picking them up and rechecking them, and everything I would need would be available at the hotel, which is rated 4 stars. I asked Se\u00f1ora Soles for a toothbrush and a comb, and she only gave me a toothbrush. When I said that the airline had told me that I didn't need my bags because the hotel would supply these things, she responded rudely that they didn't have combs.

The reception personnel couldn't have cared less that we were back, or even that we were alive. No smiles. We were not offered the 2 for 1 breakfast option. Our room had several cellophane wrappers and the tear strip from a lady's sanitary napkin on the floor.

A free shuttle bus runs regularly from the airport to the hotel and back which was easy and only took 10mins. Check in was smooth and friendly, good english spoken and lots of advice, tips and a map as it was our first trip to madrid. We did not eat at the hotel so no comment on food, but a few restaurants and bars within a few min walk of hotel. Metro stop was a 10min walk and the underground is incredibly easy & cheap to use, 1 euro gets you anywhere! We bought a block of 10trips for 9.3 euros which lasted 4 days. To get to Sol-the main town area took about 40mins from our hotel, but was no big deal as once we were there each day we stayed. Madrid is a fantastic city with lots to do and see, we did 2 english walking tours, visited the Prado(free after 6pm!), the botanical gardens and parks, good food and drink and loads going on untill the small hours.

You were right:! Very high quality hotel, excellent. Check-in at the reception was efficient and professional, and the staff speaks good English. After a long, exhausting day, what a joy to walk into our beautiful room! When you 1st enter, there's a whole separate entryway area with furniture/closet just to store your luggage. From there, you walk into the actual room and notice how spacious it is. Separate area/alcove with a desk/writing table and sitting area, etc. The bathroom was gorgeous with separate shower and bath, huge, fluffy thick towels on a towel warmer, marble counters, etc. Immaculately clean. Other definite pluses: Free internet in the lobby area, and 24 hour free shuttle to the airport which is just 5 minutes away. We had to be taken the next morning to the airport at 4:45am, and the shuttle was right on time. This hotel may be a bit more than some other airport hotels, but definitely worth the price. (139 euros). Save yourself time and stress and stay here if you need a good airport hotel. Also, thanks to the person who recommended on this site a nearby restaurant called \"Al Traste\", only 3 blocks away. It's like Appleby's, very reasonable prices and good food. They have a menu in English too. The BBQ ribs and chocolate brownie dessert were delicious!(Go 1 block east, then 2 blocks north).", "Date": "April 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Overnight Stay\u201d", "Author": "wrantar", "ReviewID": "UR7415023", "Content": "Hotel is clean, friendly, efficient, modern.
