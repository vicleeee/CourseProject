The staff were very helpful and pleasant and the room was fine, and perfectly clean. There was a great selection at breakfast time. Dinner was a different matter, not really much of a selection, plus, as this hotel seems to be popular with school/college tour groups, other 'residents' were seated outside the main dining area in a coffe bar type of area. Would have been nice to have had kettle/coffee in the room but then perhaps not having them is the norm in Spain? The only issue I had was on being charged 10 euros to access my room earlier, as the flight had landed earlier than expected. I was given the option of sitting in the reception area for 30 minutes rather than having to pay, but as I'd been travelling since 4 a.m. I just wanted to crash! otherwise, it was a pleasant hotel.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nahariya, Israel", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "D00rman", "ReviewID": "UR122954459", "Content": "The hotel was overall good.

It is a 2 minute walk to Clot metro station, which is on the L2 and very well connected without needing multiple transfers. That said, given the nice weather, we took a few nice walks to La Sagrada Familia and even all the way to Las Ramblas and did not find it too much trouble - it was a great location. We were able to see a few less touristy spots and eat a few more authentic meals than if we'd stayed directly in the city center. We stayed for 4 full days and did not use up our T-10 metro cards! Despite the fact that everyone raved about the breakfast - we did not eat it, instead, we opted for amazing .65 croissants at the bakery just 1 block past the hotel (away from the metro) - amazing, fresh, and much better than the 12 euro option at the hotel! Also, 'Isabels' is a local convenient store - .77 for a 1.5L bottle of water - if you are walking into town, better to buy it there, because at La Sagrada Familiar the same bottle was 2.50 euros. Booking: We booked on laterooms.com where the rate was substantially lower than the website and expedia. Then, I emailed the reservation staff at the Aragon, who emailed back promptly and worked with me to ensure that the room had 2 beds pushed together so that my boyfriend and I did not have to sleep across the room - very very helpful.

The bathroom was also newly redone and had a nice tub/shower combination. The housekeepers did an excellent job everyday of maintaining the rooms. You also saw them cleaning the common areas of the hotel everyday as well. There is a safe in the room but you have to pay about 5 euros per day to get the lock. Breakfast was very good.

The metro in the city is excellent...you can get to the beach fairly easily also. The hotel can get fairly noisy at times mainly because the floor is marbled for instance when people are coming in at night but don't let you put this off staying there as every other hotel I've ever stayed in have been the same. The walls are quite thin also but I think this is just common in hotels...we hardly stayed in the hotel so it really wasn't a problem for us so don't let it put you off, the positives easily outweigh the negatives.
