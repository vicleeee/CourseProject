Located between the main High Street and a rather seedy back street, it has a very small lobby/reception area (no seating whilst we were there). The bar/restaurant located on the first floor is modern with no atmosphere and therefore uninviting. At 15 Euros each the cooked breakfast was very poor, the cold buffet sufficient although many other nationalities seemed to have plates piled high so this may be a British view. The staff did their job but had no extra chat or civility to offer. The bedroom/bathroom was dark with poor lighting, but a good size and very clean with comfortable bedding and air conditioning that just about dealt with 41 degrees heat. It was quiet only because we were on the 7th floor - had we been lower down the traffic and drunken behaviour would have been fairly continuous throughout the night. Unfortunately Madrid has many many beggars and vagrants some camping in boxes outside the front door of the hotel, which we found very uncomfortable. Compared to another 4 star hotel in the same road which had a security guard on duty and no vagrants outside the Vincci seemed to have none in place. We generally did not enjoy Madrid although there is some very attractive architecture and pleasant surrounding areas outside of the Gran Via, Puerto Sol and Plaza Mayor.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but its a bit strange\u201d", "Author": "allaboutcricket", "ReviewID": "UR136991694", "Content": "We stayed in two different hotels in Madrid, the first one being the Emperador Hotel just 2 mins walk from the Vincci Capitol. However I was most looking forward to the Vincci Capitol having stayed in its sister hotel in Salamanca and that was great. We paid the extra to have a room with a terrace which was nice but the solid brick wall is so high when you are sitting down you can't see over it. Our room was very dark and a very narrow and long. You had to literally squeeze past the end of the bed to get to the wardrobe. The bathroom again was dark and was the strangest shape and design. The sink for example is massive with the taps at one end squashed against the back corner so when you turned it on the water didnt go all over the sink. The plughole was close to the tap and you had to manually lift out the stopper to let the water flow down, not nice really when the water has been used or else leave the stopper out and have a massive hole you could drop your toothbrush down. The bathroom needed a major overhaul and this disappointed me as it was more money than the previously mentioned Emperador. Check out my other review for this hotel. The bar was atmosphere-less. We went in it a couple of times and were the only people. Not even any bar staff. You have to ring the bell and hope someone comes to serve you. You would think the view would be stunning as the bar is on the 8th floor (I think, its high up anyway) but the windows with the view down Gran Via was filled with a massive dining table to seat about 20 people which you wouldnt sit at if you were only two, like we were. the reception is on the ground floor but there is no foyer and only one sofa to seat two people. Personally I think this hotel is trying to be something it isn't, perhaps they have visited the crazy Bear in London/Beaconsfield/Oxford but really havent pulled it off. Having said all that our stay was pleasant, the reception staff were very helpful and the bed was comfy but I wouldnt stay there again.

Result? isible dust and previous guests fingerprints everwhere. DISGUSTING. (ii) when not black lacque, why not colourless plastic? again, not practical for quick cleaning, fingreprints everywhere... (iii) the sophisticated light systems and its regimes. You have welcome regime, relax regime, tv watch regime, bath on regime....result? No matter what you do, yo do not get proper light in your room. You cannot have light in the bathroom without having a bit of light on in the sleeping room, etc....in combination with black you feel like in a dark cave, not a room. (iv) the rooms simply do not work. E.g. when using the oh so designed shower, the water doesnt go away from its bottom thansk to oh so stylish stones on its ground and when you then open the door, there is a flood in the whole room. WHen using the tub on the other hand, it is so nice and so big, but it has such sharp (stylish:))) angles inside, that it is not comfortable to sit in there. And the water outlet does enormous noise, (v) The choice of colours and decorations in the entire building including the breakfast area does not give a fel of a four star classy and modern hotel. It feels like a noght club or a brother which has its best days far behind, because all those oh so trendy black laques and other materials that were used were not of the best quality and the construction works were not done the best way so everything is peeling, tearing, going off... It certainly is not a four star hotel in treating its guests. The front desk staff really could plaster at least a BIT of smile on their faces. No smile, no welcome, no info on uipgrade of one of our rooms, no info on where and when the breakfast is, on pay tv and internet (with extraorbitant prices so no tiv and internet) and not on spa which I was longing to use but after the way they treated us, seeing the poor hygiene in the room (seeing that and STILL entering the waters of jacuzzi? I would have to be an idiot) and unable to read the conditions and price lists anywhere, I decided to spend the money outside of the place in the end. Furthermore, the staff were completely ignoring one of the persons staying in the room. In three day, we got only one shower gel, one shampoo, two pieces of soap and one toothbrush. And only one towel at time was replaced. Although BOTH were dirty. Huh? Further we got a room smelling like an astray although having specifically claimed and written anemail to the hotel 3 and half week prior to our arrival that we want a non smoking room. We had to leave the windows open for several hours and subsequently the room was so cold that we were trembling all night long and subsequently went sick (I am actually writing the review in bed). Next day, an additional card appeared in our room, keeping the airconditioning running to make the room warmer (and the air dryer). Note that there is no real heating system in the hotel. WHen we asked for additional blankets they only arrived after we went to the reception to ask again for the second time. Mind this, they were not clean. They had been used. Had some dirt sticking in the hair of the blankets. Huh? The breakfast was the brigher part of the stay. The buffet offered quite a lot of various possibilities, taking into account that SPanish are not a breakfast nation. It certainly was not like is Bavaria, Germany, but it was rich and plentiful. But be aware. I took a piece of honeydew which must have been lying around for four days or so, because it was sour. Other day, I noticed a highly stylish lady which spitting sour grapefruit juice back to the pitcher....(Besides, Spanish very little wash their hands after the loo, and dont get yourself fooled with LV bags, CH outfits and freshly coiffed hair....so be careful and rather touch the instruments using a paper tissue not to get some diarheea. it is the pure experience of life in Spain speaking out of me, not some hate - I love Spain.) DO not stay here if you hate Spanish style of bedding - sheets (with little holes) and not that clean blanket are on the scene here - when not friends with that, go Eurostars instead - my experience. I love the location of the hotel, because of the marvellous vista of bustling Gran Via with so different colours every hour of the day. Therefore I would ADORE to stay there again. But I will keep on looking for better place for my repetitive stays in Madrid becuase I want to GET four star treatment (smile? assistance) and service (especially cleanliness of the rooms) not only PAY that.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cornwall", "Title": "\u201cWhat a position!!!\u201d", "Author": "capersCornwall", "ReviewID": "UR121049580", "Content": "As it was our first trip to Madrid we really didnt know what to expect !!!! rooms were very clean and comfortable and the position was outstanding!!!

Whilst the hotel is very central right in the middle of Gran Via and within walking distance to many of the sights of Madrid and many restaurants and cafes it is as mentioned in other reviews quite dark inside with lots of black, red and dark purple colours for walls and furnishings and service leaves a lot to be desired. Our room had cream walls but very dark floor boards and looking a little tired. Although we had booked a room with a double bed we got a room with two singles put together. The bathroom was really dark with weird lighting options which you could set to arrival, intimate or relax but when you set the bathroom light it also affected the room lighting and vice versa. Even then the lighting was not very bright. The airconditioner didnt work properly and we had a room which had the afternoon sun coming through the window, which made the room hot even with the sunblock curtains drawn. When we complained the service technician told us that we were expecting the airconditioner to be as cold as we have in it Australia which they do not have in Spain. Bit a of joke really. Lucky for us we were moving to another hotel the next day. Some of the staff were friendly but mostly they did not seem too interested in providing any service. We only found out by accident the day before we checked out that whilst there is no free wifi at this hotel if you have your own laptop they will let you borrow a network cable free of charge and you can access the internet via cable for free. The hotel information provided mentioned not to leave your towels or personal items at the swimming pool, so you can imagine our surprise when we went looking for the pool that there is no swimming pool only a spa which we did not use as you had to pay to use it. Although the beds were comfortable, we had to take our pillows down to reception and ask for them to be replaced as they smelt of tobacco smoke. I had to phone twice to check where the pillows were and then when they finally replaced them they smelt the same. After we returned them for the second time they eventually gave us a set that did not smell but felt damp as if they had just washed the pillow slips and they had not quite dried. At least they didnt smell that time. Would we stay there again? I don't think so and I probably would not recommend this hotel to anyone else.

The terrace was great and south facing (especially as the weather was so hot) but it eats into the overall square footage of the room. i.e. rooms with roof terraces are tiny! You can barely walk round the bed to get to the bathroom. Room itself was clean and well maintained but unfortunately the TV didn't work properly, maybe due to the high winds we experienced. The bed was also very uncomfortable. Air con took a long time to get going. The hotel has a spa but it is \u20ac32 euros each (yes each) to use it for 1 hour!! That is outrageous. We assumed it was free as there is no mention of the charge on Expedia.co.uk whom we used to book the hotel. Location is fantastic. Right in the heart of Gran Via and easy walking distance to most major attractions like Plaza Mayor, San Miguel Market, theatres and shops. In in all, the hotel was a disappointment which was partly cancelled out by the amazing view we had from the terrace. If you are looking to book here I would say the roof terrace is the only really appealing aspect of this hotel.

Lamps in room had no bulbs. Lighting was at best dim not unlike a vampire crypt but bright burn your eyes our bathroom lights. Also at midnight the TV would just turn on and scare the daylights out of you! Their security is not very good and Madrid is high crime with a bad vibe. Within 20 mins of landing from Australia via LA I had been robbed they stole my passport and 2 credit cards! So terrible. Anyway I was in the glass elevator of the hotel a man got in on floor 4 and stayed staring at me up to floor 9. I got out so did he and he linger for me to do God knows what I was terrified pounding on my dole for my friend to let me in. Once inside I rang reception they do not speak much English. She could not understand me so did nothing. I went down again in morning and told the English speaking lady and she made some vague reference to checking security footage. She was not surprised and was totally blas\u00e9 even though she did say sorry. So pluses are it's in a good location and it's clean. Bad is not many staff speak English and poor security.

The bathroom is fairly large, but the shower screen leaked badly and the shower itself was very weak and disappointing.

The rooms have no tea/coffee facilities or ironing board - ironing boards were not available from reception; instead we were instructed to pay \u20ac4 per time to have them ironed.

The location was great \u2013 a short walk to restaurants, shopping, Puerto del Sol and other sites. Compared to the other hotels during our trip, this was not our favorite but it was definitely not a bad place to stay for the price. We experienced a problem with our shower door as it would not shut causing water to spill out. We informed the hotel staff and they told us that they would provide us with additional towels and send someone to fix the door. No one actually showed up so we ended up calling the front desk once we returned from dinner in the evening. Maintenance did in fact show up and graciously provided us with towels but said that unfortunately, there was no way he could fix it at that time. Well, in the end, we decided to just deal with it rather than make a big fuss. Other than this issue, we had no other problems with the room. We had been spoiled during the earlier parts of our trip at other hotels in which our room provided us with beautiful views of the city. This room did not face the city so we did not have this luxury. There was a rooftop area though which did provide aerial views of Gran Via and other parts of Madrid. We realized early on that the hotel staff were not as helpful in providing good restaurant recommendations in town. Fortunately, we had done our own research and knew where to sightsee and eat. Everything was within walking distance. We spent a great deal of time visiting Cava Baja which is a street lined with great tapas bars and restaurants, most of which were very reasonably priced (we probably tried the majority of them!). We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Madrid despite the minor issues at the hotel. As the other reviews indicate, many people, including ourselves, found this hotel to be a great place to stay. By the way, for those people worried about staying on Gran Via due to the busy road and prostitution, you really don\u2019t have anything to worry about. We barely spent any time on Gran Via except to get back to our hotel. My husband and I did not spot one single prostitute (unless they look different from those in the US!). We honestly felt pretty safe. Like any major city though, you will come across a great deal of beggars throughout Madrid.

The view of Gran Via from the 9th floor patio was a nice side benefit as well. The entrance to the metro is right outside the door, as are theatres and many shops. Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor, Teatro Real and the Palacio Real are easily within walking distance. Although it has an extremely central location in Madrid (read: lots of people and cars until the early hours of the morning), we had no noise problems or no problem sleeping, and we were on the 4th floor (but not on the Gran Via side, perhaps that helped).

Still, it is downtown and walking distance to old Madrid, which is good. However, no parking in the hotel and most important, no real place to stop the car and leave your bags, making the arrival a bit difficult. Honestly, I cannot understand this point as I guess most of the people is arriving by car (own car or taxi). Still, there are some parkings nearby, so no worries of leaving your car outside. However, the one I selected was really tight. Rooms are of an average size with usual amenities/facilities and usual bedding, nothing special. Bathrooms small, as usually happens in this kind of hotels, didn't really like it. Sleeping quality can be disturbed by the noise of the street, even when staying in high floors. My room had no proper desk to work. Breakfast quite normal, nothing to be excited about. The decoration of the corridors is fantastic, the staircase is lovely and the elevators are perfectly mixed with the whole package. Really, if you like this style, the hotel is worth a visit.

For example the bathroom door in our bedroom would not close fully and water leaked from under the bath when using the shower. There was also buzzing noise coming from the electrical service box in the room which was a bit annoying at night. We had asked for a double bed when booking and got two large sized single beds pushed together.

We were in a standard Room-704. Small but efficient. There is a closet, safe, bar fridge and shelving on one side of the room, all lit with overhead lights. Upon entering the room, the lights are turned on by inserting the door card into a slot. As is common in most Vincii hotels, the decor is modern and stylish-stainless and wood. The bath is compact and the door gets in the way. After a couple of days, we adjusted to the size of the room and bath. Our window faced a side street although we could see the plaza and a wonderful view of the city. We didn't spend any time on the patio which is also on the 7th floor. The street noise was minimal except for Saturday night when the young crowd was roaming the streets. There are 3 elevators and almost always there is one waiting for use. The beds were so comfortable which was great after a day of walking around downtown and standing in the museums, plazas and parks. The location is perfect. The staff at the reception desk is very pleasant and helpful, especially Severine in the afternoon and Cristina in the day. Plaza Callao is outside the door as is the Gran Via, Metro and numerous bus lines. We didn't do the hotel breakfast at 15 euros per person. Th bar/dining area is beautifully decorated but there are plenty of eateries for breakfast right outside the door. Our favorites were Pain Quotidien and VIPS, both just steps away from the front door. The Plazas are great places for walking, seeing and being seen. If you find you forgot something, there is a department store/supermarket on the plaza. We got water, soda and juices to keep in the room bar fridge. Do take advantage of the MetroCard. We used AeroCity to get to the hotel when we arrived. There was a mix-up and we waited about 45 minutes for our transportation. Finally we were picked up by a very nice and apologetic driver to refused a tip because of our inconvenience. On departure, we took the Metro to the airport. It was not at all difficult but be sure to get directions and a map. It was a much better trip. We travel light so we only had one roll bag and that helped because at one station there were steps to climb.

This hotel was absolutely perfect for my partner and I. The location, on the Gran Via, was so central I don't think anything else would have done as well for us. It was in the immediate vicinity of three metro lines and within immediate walking distance of major sights - Sol, Plaza Mayor, obviously Gran Via itself, Plaza Espana etc. Within a 10 minute walking distance were Malasana, Chueca and Los Austrias/La Latina and within a 20 minute walking distance were the Prado and the other museums on the Passeo. From this perspective, it was perfect. The architecture of the building is iconic to the city - the building was featured on the advertising for the celebrations related to the 100th anniversary of the Gran Via. The building's interiors were obviously recently refurbished but many of its original features were left in tact. Each floor maintained a 1930's-style design aesthetic with original plans and layouts for the building displayed in the newer elevator lobby. The interior was light and open. We were on the 7th floor, facing the interior courtyard and which featured a \"solarium\" looking out over old Madrid - basically a terrace with some lounge chairs, tables and showers should guest wish to tan. There was a 9th floor look out over the Gran Via as well which was popular in the evenings. The facilities, including the solarium and terrace, were amazing and provided for a good respite from the bustle of the city. The hotel was quiet despite being on the Gran Via. However, other items (massage room, sauna, restaurant etc) were no included in our hotel stay but looked nice. The restaurant was nicely designed and fit the look of the hotel. Overall, the location and design were very adequate for what we were looking for. A definite plus if you plan to party - Malasana, Chueca and the other parts of Old Madrid were in walking distance and right on the metro. There were some \"kinks\" that made us wonder, however. The room did not include a WiFi connection; internet access was offered via an Ethernet cable which was to be provided but never came, despite a second call to reception. By coincidence, we brought our own and ended up using it. As a business hotel, there was some other oddities - no desk for your laptop, but plenty of well designed but not so functional night-stand type tables were available in our room. Nonetheless, the layout was perfect - bright, plenty of closest space and a tasteful, large bathroom. The fixtures were very chic (-though, the side mirror was placed at chest level - I am only 5'8 - and I could only see my shoulders when looking into it; it couldn't move up or down nor could it be tilted; however, if you're 5'5, you're in luck!). We had a \"King Bed\", in reality, two queens put together, which wasn't conducive to, well, things one may partake in otherwise. These, however, were very minor oddities and should not be deterrents to staying in this hotel which honestly was great. The only complaint of merit would be the service. I understand that this is a Spanish chain and am very happy to learn a little bit of the local language when travelling (and am very happy I did), because on certain days and times no staff member spoke English. Despite asking politely in Spanish if the reception staff spoke English, several times there was confusion about what I was asking. At one point when asking for a cork screw for wine we purchased, I was referred to the restaurant, whose staff told me I had to come down to the first floor to get the corkscrew. When I appeared, they told me I had to go get the bottle and bring it down to have it unscrewed! Luckily for me, I was happy enough to have avoided the volcano mess and was in a good mood because otherwise it was insanely bizarre to me to have had to go through such trouble in a four star hotel. If I was in a family B&B, I would have understood this, but here? Weird! Nonetheless, every other interaction was prompt and courteous, though we figured out how to ask for ice in Spanish and it was all well and good! The staff also don't bother you when coming in and out of hotels, though if you have a friend calling or visiting, they sure do like to question them. Despite this oddity in service, we still had an excellent experience and, hey, learned a few extra words in Spanish.

The hotel rates itself as 4 star however the service is within the 1 star category. The last time I arrived, I left my bags at front desk and waited for them to be delivered. After waiting for sometime, I fell asleep. Awoke 30 min later and the bags were still not up. Called downstairs and was told to come down and get them myself if I need them quickly. Gee....like 30 min wait was not enough. Dropped dry cleaning off on Monday....2 days later it was not back, yet I did not receive even a call. When I called downstairs, I was told, \"Tomorrow.\" Every second day, your access card for the door gets deactivated. The hotel staff blames it on the guests, \"Oh, it is because you carry it beside your cell phone.\", \"Oh..it is because you kept it with your credit cards.\" And listen to the best one, \"It is because you went to a department store and the anti-theft system deactivated it.\". After the second deactivation it becomes so annoying to have to wait for the elevators, go to your room and then find that you cannot get in and to have to go downstairs again. Since we stayed for a 2 week period, after the first week the system deactivated my card because they wanted me to go to front desk and leave a bigger deposit on my card. After complaining that following a 12 hr day at the office, the last thing I want to do is go to my room and find that I cannot get in, I was told that \"The staff prefers to speak to us face to face when it comes to putting another hold on my card\" Duhhhh.....don't you think that there are better ways to discuss matters like this - like giving me call! I annoyingly told them that they can put whatever hold they want on my card and left. 15 min later I call front desk to have them connect mem to another room. Same employee I spoke to earlier instead of fulfilling my request decides that first thing he should tell me that my card is getting declined. I reply that it is their system, he insists it is my card and if I don't have another card I should put deposit in cash. At this point I am super annoyed and told her that I do not wanna discuss this and want to be connected to the other room. To make the long story short, I spent 15 min on the phone with AmEx and there were no issues with my card. The rooms are dark & do not have even a small working desk. Network jack for the internet is stuck in a corner, so if you need to work, your only option is to sit like a caveman in a cornet on a tiny coffee table and a bad soft cushion chair - definitely a no for a business traveller. Bathroom toiletries are sub-par, very weird and uncomfortable hanging rack for shirts and jackets. According to my co-workers, quality of room service food is poor. Bed is comfortable but the majority of the rooms have double beds so if you are with a wife/girlfriend/boyfriend and want to get closer, please mind the gap! Another annoying thing is that all electric sockets are connected to the room key-card reader, so if you go out and want in the mean time to charge your camera batteries or electric shaver, you cannot do that because there will be no AC/DC. Tried leaving my key in the reader and using my second card for entry, however room service knew better and collected my card key.

The staff were very helpful and speak English. One night we had a power cut in our room, I phoned reception and a repairman came up straight away. it wasn't until after he left that we realised the time. It was midnight so it really was good service! The hotel bar is very nice. A beer and a glass of red wine cost just over 7 euros. Which we thought was fine. The rooms are very quiet and you cannot hear any of the outside noise. We did however hear other guests letting their doors slam every now and then but it didn't really bother us. The area is wonderful and lively and is near lots of bars and restaurants. We definately want to stay here again! Even though there are loads of people around and this area is busy there are a lot of prostitutes in the area day and night, particularly in Calle de la Montera, which is a pedestrianised street near hotel. We didn't feel threatened at all, we just got used to it and enjoyed watching them in the end. Tips: We used the metro a few times. The ticket machine has an English language option we got a 10 trip ticket which we shared and it cost around 7.50 euros otherwise it is 1 euro per journey. If you decide to go to Botin restaurant, the worlds oldest restaurant which is in most guide books and in the guiness book of records then we recommend you book your table as it gets very busy. We asked the reception staff to book it for us. We had their set menu 40.20 euros Gazpacho Soup, Roast Suckling Pig, Ice Cream and 1/2 bottle wine per person. Delicious! If you decide to go to Toledo, be aware that the train get's full very quickly. We aimed to get the 10.20 train and we arrived at about 9.45 and it had sold out the next one was at 12.20 and took this train and at the time of booking you have to decide on what time train you are returning on too. Toledo is lovelly but there is a lot of steps to go up to get to the village. On a hot day it is a little tiring. We went to a bullfight. The stadium is right next to the metro station. The bullfighting is very popular and there was about 20,000 people there when we went and then of course a mad rush for the metro station afterwards. In the stadium We sat at the top in the shade and our tickets cost 7 euros each. Where we sat the seats are concrete steps. half of the step is for the person's feet behind you and the other half is for your backside it wasn't comfortable. There are cushions to hire. If you pay more then you may get a more comfortable step to sit on but our seats were the best in the end because it rained and all of the people in the good seat s at the front got wet. Prepare yourself, bullfighting isn't for the faint hearted. I did find it upsetting. It would probably be helpful to read up on bullfighting before you go so you can understand what's going on and prepare yourself on what to expect.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201camazing location amazing price amazing rooms\u201d", "Author": "mbilal84", "ReviewID": "UR40204238", "Content": "This is a perfect package!!

LOCATION- This hotel is located on Gran Via, one of the major streets in Madrid... hence, its name. It's a pretty quick cab ride from the central train station -about 6euros. It's actually a decent location for shopping and dining also, and because it's not smack in the middle of the center prices are not as high. Additionally, the main tour bus stops right across the street so that was a definite plus because you can get ALL around town and back to the hotel without any problems. (by the way, I recommend purchasing the 2day bus tour tickets) STAFF- The staff did their best to be helpful from the start. When we arrived (after 3pm) our room was not yet ready and because it should have been, the manager offered us complimentary drinks in the hotel bar while we waited -that was a plus. However, that plus was canceled out by the food we decided to have w/ the drinks. The food here is not at all recommended. The manager said she'd send someone for us when the room was ready and when that didn't happen after an hour and a half, we decided to go back down. She was very apologetic, told us the room had been ready for sometime and was upset at her staff for not calling us. Whatever, it happens!! ROOMS- If you choose this hotel, I recommend a room with a terrace, it was the only PLUS. We had room 910. It offered great views of Gran Via, the city and snow capped mountains in the opposite direction. Despite its busy location, the rooms were very quite. As for the interior, we reserved a room w/ a King bed but it turned out to be a Queen. The room was also really tight as most European rooms are. These things weren't that big of a deal to us, however, the cleanliness was. The room was not well lit but I'm an inspector. The chair in the room was very dingy as were the throw pillows on the bed AND the bathroom, OY VEY, it was icky. Surprisingly it was a rather large bathroom and if it had been clean, would've been great. However, the bath tub had moldy walls and the shower floors were really gritty. Suffice to say, we opted to not use the shower. Really was a shame :( To end, this room was a definite bargain at 100euros/night and like I mentioned, the location is convenient for tourists but I would NOT stay here again. There are too many other options in this city. While we don't ever spend much time in a hotel, I do require a clean one when calling it a night. Thus, I'd advise future travelers to keep searching!!!", "Date": "May 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNot Bad!\u201d", "Author": "Littlesean", "ReviewID": "UR25234738", "Content": "I looked at many hotels in Madrid before deciding on this one. The main reason we chose Vincci Capitol was due to its central location, however after spending 4 days in Madrid it is apparent how close everything is. We walked around every day and things are fairly close by including lots of other hotels! The Vincci capitol is the kind of sleek modern \"boutique\" hotel that we prefer and it was a nice clean hotel. We were give a tiny room though and you could almost touch both walls with you arms outstretched despite booking a junior suite in advance!! We ended up getting a move down to room 505 after being placed on the 8th floor at the side of the hotel (which we had to pay for!!). As you look at the building from the outside you can see the junior suites at the front of the building, the curved shape windows that look directly on to the Gran Via. 505 is on the second floor up and it is worth trying for one of these rooms if you like some space. The rooms nearby were also of a good size so dont settle for a \"Box room\". If you look closely at the fittings, fixtures and the finish you can see that they have cut corners and settled for cheaper fixtures, the shower rail and hand rail both moved and were loose, the door to the shower had not been finished and you could see the glue and nails holding the frame to the wall! The tiles felt like plastic as did the washbasin. If you dont mind these minor details then its a great look achieved on a limited budget. Not exactly top notch quality but still a nice hotel, next time i would try the Vincci 66, a bit further out (2K) but a beautiful place with a great bar and restaurant. Use the Metro if you can its easy enough but look out for thieves and hustlers in the area where you buy the tickets and on busy trains!!!!

The staff were friendly and helpful, and the room was clean and tidy. The Capitol building is iconic, and a feature in itself. Having looked at numerous hotels in Madrid online before deciding on the Vincci Capitol, it was certainly one of the most modern looking, compared to other 3 and 4 star hotels in the Gran Via area that were of a similar price. When we booked the room, we requested a double room, however having read a number of reviews from people saying they had ended up with two twins pushed together, I emailed the hotel direct to request a double. Their reply stated that they couldn't guarantee it, however when we got there, we were told they had the request and we had a double room. The room itself was nice - on the side of the hotel so not looking down the Gran Via, but still modern, clean and tidy. And yes, there is only one English TV channel (CNN), but do you really go to Madrid to watch TV in your hotel room?! It has to be said the lighting in the room is unique, and can be temperamental, but it didn't pose too many problems. Also, an added bonus is that each room has its own heating / air conditioning which you can control yourself, and the window can be opened to get fresh air in. The main selling point about the hotel has to be the location: right on the Gran Via and close to all the main attractions of the city centre. Don't forget to visit the roof terrace which offers amazing views across the city, day and night (although sadly no opportunity for a sunset viewing as it is on the wrong side of the building), and take some time to rest your feet in the hotel bar on the third floor, which offers views straight down the Gran Via. Overall, the hotel is contemporary, and high quality, and was ideal for a romantic long weekend break. I would definitely recommend it, more for a break rather than a business trip (whilst there is free wifi in the rooms, there was no desk or working space). If you're going, definitely look around for a discount on the room rate as although it's 4 star, with the poor exchange rate for travellers from the UK, it's probably not worth the full price.", "Date": "February 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Location\u201d", "Author": "Boroughbloke", "ReviewID": "UR24059796", "Content": "I've stayed here many times.

On the surface the hotel has a contemporary, style with clean lines and a rich but subdued colour scheme. I actually liked having the hardwood flooring instead carpeting for a change. The hotel is relatively new, so most things still look fresh and function as they should. A closer inspection shows some cost-saving choices, like a plastic wash basin and thin wood veneers. However, these do not detract from the look and feel. I had a shower but no bath, but I prefer this anyway. The shower stall was large and had a wonderful textured stone floor and walls and a huge, high-mounted shower head. The room could have been slightly larger and I think a coffee/tea maker should be provided. Service was very friendly and efficient. Because I was exhausted the first night of arrival, I tried to order room service - but be warned, unlike at the front desk, not much English is spoken elsewhere in the hotel.

During our previous visits we had booked Executive rooms which had been nice and relatively modern. This year after viewing the hotel web site, pictures and 'virtual tours' I decided to splash out on what appeared to be a decent sized Junior Suite costing around 390 euros per night. This appeared from the pictures on the hotels own web site to have a seperate lounge area, jacuzzi bath, even a really special looking round bed. At check in we were given keys for from 902, which I was assured was a Junior Suite. Image our dissappointment when we found that the room was actually smaller than that we had stayed in the previous year - no bigger than a basic room. The bed was a very small double. It had no seperate seating area, and a standard bath (which doubled as a shower). I immediately phone reception and was advised that 902 was classed as Junior Suite because it had a small terrace! I was informed the manager was out and nothing could be done that night. The next morning I met with the Manager. I explained that the room was nothing like that which was being marketed on this hotel web site and certainly not worth 390 euros per night (surely there must be laws against misleading advertising in Spain?). She agreed with me that 902 was not in anyway like a Junior Suite featured on the web site. We were offered room 903 (next door). 903 featured a larger, king sized bed and seperate lounge. The bathroom was identical to those in other parts of the hotel (in which some of our friends were staying). Interestingly the manager said that they only have one suite that looks like the suite marketed on the internet. And what appears to be a large round feature bed in the suite is really only suitable for single use. Marketing these rooms like this is in my view really misleading. At check out, we were still charged the full price for the first night. Other points to note. It seems that the hotel has problems with the showers - which leak water onto the floor. Be careful not to slip.

I would recommend these older reviews, they are really good. Just a few small points based on our own experience. The hotel lobby is very small, almost inexistent, because the hotel shares the lower floors of the building with a movie theater. This wasn't really an issue for us, just that you know what to expect. The restaurant and bar are on the first floor. A few select rooms have the terrific view of the Grand Via shown in the photographs. Most windows simply face the building across the street. Yet other windows open to a plain interior courtyard. Something to keep in mind if this is important to you. We had a room to the courtyard and it was very quiet. If you need to wear earplugs to sleep like I do, this may be a good trade. Some reviewers mentioned issues with the lights. Although the light controls are indeed unusually complicated, (7 buttons in total, only labeled in Spanish) they worked fine. The issue may be that the first two buttons from the top are switching and dimming the lights both in the room and in the bathroom at the same time. With the next two below them you can control the lights independently. I have a similar observation about the TV. You can watch regular broadcast TV channels, but you'll need to navigate through the menu system to get there. Finally, what you read here about the darkness of the colors used everywhere through the hotel is true.

Firstly this hotel is excellent for a swift visit to Madrid, close to the Metro and on top of all the places you need to cram in on a whistle stop tour. Positives: - Great location - Clean and comfortable rooms. - Nice staff. The negatives: - If i was to stay here longer than a weekend, i think the dark lighting and all the walls,and floors being black would get me down a bit. A little claustrophobic. -The lighting in the bathroom for the ladies to put on makeup is not ideal. - The TV does not broadcast local tv, it only does pay-per-view movies, news and music which were all a rip-off. I love being abroad and switching on the local telly and having a chessy music station on or just checking out the local tv. whilst getting ready to go out. All in all, would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone, especially for the price i paid ;-) Madrid is an amazing city and if your only here for a weekend, you really shouldn't be in your bed all that much! PS, our visit to Madrid was really made when we booked a Tapas tour for the Saturday. The popular and busy Tapas restaurants can be a bit intimidating and scary if you don't know what to order, drink etc. This tour was excellent and our guide introduced us to many off the 'tourist track' tapas bars.

I would not hesitate to return to this location if I am ever in Madrid again.", "Date": "July 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galway", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "Irelandhorse", "ReviewID": "UR8231519", "Content": "This hotel is right in the centre of everything, The shopping area is right outside the door of the hotel and the ''old part of the city '' Plaza de Mayor is about 5 mins walk away with lots of lovely restaurants and bars.

BEWARE! Still going thru some growing pains, but I suspect its a more pervasive problem than that. We a nice king bedded room, even a bonus terrace overlooking the Grand Via. However, when we were awakened at 2am sweating to death, we realized the air conditioning only blew HOT air. Needless to say we weren't going to call reception at that hour, but we had a totally sleepless night as the sirens roared down the Grand Via. And all but 2 TV channels were snow (and only spanish-language channels). Did I also mention one of the towels hanging was visibly filthy when we checked in? Normally overlook this kind of thing since we're pretty easy going but it was just more evidence of the lack of attention to detail throughout the hotel. In the morning, when we went to reception to describe these problems, the receptionist appeared to take interest and said it would be taken care of by the time we got back from sightseeing. Oh, the explanation for the spanish-only channels was the following: \"We've only been open 2 months and we don't have the satellite yet.\" Of course when we returned nothing was fixed and the afternoon receptionist had no knowledge of our morning discussion. They then sent someone to our room to check the A/C (si, caliente, senora!) and we were switched to a lower floor, interior view room for our troubles (but clean towels, working A/C, and 10 clear spanish TV channels at least). This process took 1.5 HOURS. When we asked to speak to a manager, the receptionist told us he doesn't speak English (a problem with many of the staff members, and the command of the desk staff is frankly not great). When I told the receptionist that I was disappointed by the way things had been handled, and described that hotels would typically give a free upgrade or substantial discount for a sleepless night such as ours, we got an offer of free breakfast. A small token but I shouldn't have had to ask if the hotel was genuinely remorseful or cared about customer service. Yes, rooms are modern and although small (expected for any city center location), well designed with reasonable storage space if you're staying a 1-3 nights. Anything longer and the closet/drawer space will be insufficient in a standard room. Location and free (wired) internet is a definite plus, and if they can get their act together, could be a great find. Overall, the Vincci Capitol is inconsistent, both in terms of the physical hotel and the staff. I sincerely hope they improve.", "Date": "June 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "singapore", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel at given rates & location\u201d", "Author": "donovanSY", "ReviewID": "UR7867504", "Content": "We are a family with a young one from Singapore. We loved the hotel's great location along gran via as its walking distance of the old city of madrid. The setup is new as its newly refurbished and given the location, its rates are attractive. Our room is of a decent size even though we added in a roll away bed. We stayed on the 6th floor and there were hardly any street noises. There are nearby eateries and the metro is extremely near for reach into other parts of madrid. The modern furbishing & look also went down well with our family although the water drainage of the toilet can be improved... Another pleasant surprise is the FOC internet access which is normally chargeable in other hotels. We will definitely stay at this hotel again if we do visit Madrid if the conditions remain the same or are better.
