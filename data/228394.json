{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very Clean, modern, good for a weekend stay I stayed in this hotel several years ago when friends visited me from the states. It was near the air force base (which was still open back then) so it was a convinient choice at that time. The hotel is modern, seems new,  very clean. Rooms were very euro Ikea ish. Quiet nights sleep. My only gripe is I need a fan to sleep and the rooms did not have any type of unit I could use. I suppose b/c its Germany  mostly mild weather year round. From what I remember this hotel is NOT within walking distance to eateries, train station, or the airport. So you'll need a rental car or use the hotel's shuttle service to the airport/city.", "Date": "Jul 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR257574632", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "nittanyliones"}, {"Content": "Nice Hotel - Good Room Prices Or family stayed at this hotel for one night prior to retuning to the US after three weeks abroad. The hotel was very clean, and resonably priced (55Euros). The rooms were modern and spacious with minibars (1 out of 3 were actually cold), bathrooms with tubs (rare in this price-range in Germany) and nice comfy beds. The amenities included a very nice pool (no shallow end for small kids), sauna, and turkish steam room. The hotel staff was freindly, English speaking, and very accomidating. The hotel is a 10 minute drive from the Frankfurt airport, and has many restaraunts, and a train station within walking distance. The only thing we were wildly disappointed about was the cost of food at the hotel - dinner started at 20 Euros, and breakfast was 16 Euros ($20) per person - that is over one third of the cost of our room.", "Date": "May 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR874889629", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mandlintx"}, {"Content": "hotel usato per viaggio lavoro   showReview(19555063, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR485568085", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "mile72"}, {"Content": "Giudizio : E' un albergo...   showReview(11375312, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 10, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR378305826", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d228394-r17808097-Hotel_Rhein_Main_Frankfurt-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "228394", "Price": "$163"}}
