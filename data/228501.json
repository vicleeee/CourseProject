We had the luxury of getting a balcony room on the 4th floor. The view of the Atacha train station was nothing to write home about, but our room had a lock-safe and a good sized bathroom (always a plus)! If we were to rate this hotel on just the hotel, I would have rated it a 4/5 but the location brings it down to a 3/5. At first the location didn't seem like a deal breaker, but a ten minute walk to the Metro, then a 20 minute Metro side to Sol (city center) wasn't ideal. My wife and I don't mind walking and seeing the non-tourist way of life, but every minute counts when your on vacation. A hotel located closer to Sol would have made the trip just a little better. I felt as if this hotel was very American, when I travel to Spain I want to experience the full Spanish culture! For a hotel close to the Atacha train station, this would be great.

The Rafael Atocha hotel was located in the south of the city not within walking distance of the main attractions but right next to the Atocha Renfe Train/Tube station. The Hotel itsself was very well maintained and extremely clean. The staff were very pleasent and very professional. We opted for room and breakfast and experienced the usual continental breakfast. It was well cooked and very fresh. Saturday was fine with plenty of space in the dining room but Sunday was extremely busy and we had to wait for approx 10 mins to be seated. However this is the only slight grumble on what was an otherwise excellent experience. The room was excellent, very spacious and cleaned regularly by the cleaners. The cleaners however need to be aware of the noise they make when cleaning as we were woke both mornings by the cleaning carts being dragged across the wooden floors by loudly shouting cleaners. When we checked out we asked to leave our bags as our flight was not until later that evening and the receptionists allowed us to do this without issue. All in all a fantastic experience and all the staff at the Rafael Atocha should be proud of their efforts as we both really enjoyed our stay. Madrid is a fantastic city, we did not see half of what we wanted to see (with only 2 full days there) and will definitely be returning to see the rest, and we would definitely return to the Rafael Atocha as it was a most pleasent hotel to stay in.

At first, the location of the hotel is perceived as horrible, but after a few days, it really grew on our family. It is not a 4 star, as most of the hotels in Madrid bill themselves, I am not sure any of them truly are. The hotel was clean, the beds are ok, bathrooms are tiled. I would say this hotel is more of a Holiday Inn Express or Hampton Inn type quality, fine for the price. If you stay, bring toiletries, as the only bath product is an all in one shower gel. Ask for a room in the back of the hotel, as the main road in front is very noisy if the windows are open. Use either Metro stop at Delicias or Palos de la Frontera, both are quick walks (8 minutes) and can take you right up to Sol. If traveling in from the airport, use the Renfe it is about 2 Euro each and runs right to Delicias. Stay away from the restaurant down the street, it is not busy for a reason, food is ok, but prices are out of line compared to other places. You must stop at Bodega Rosell which is on General Lacy and 5 minutes from the Hotel. Tapas are extrordinary and prices are great, we spent 65 and 85 Euros, for family of four, the two times we were there (two bottles of wine the one night).

A lot of banging, loud talking, etc. The restaurant's prices are not excessive, and we used our mini-bar fridge to store left-overs. The closest metro stop is 5-10 min walk away, and you are only three stops from the center of town (a 5 min ride or so), and a couple blocks from the bars, supermarket and restaurants/bodegas frequented by the neighborhood folks (i.e. not touristy).

Bathroom very nice with clean towels every day if you want them. All the staff are very nice and reception gave us a map to get around the city.

However, as has been pointed out it isn't the most accessible hotel from public transport and even you don't mind a good walk, as we do, it got a bit monotonous going up and down the same road nearly every time we went out even cutting through the impressive hall of the train station.

The Prado offers free entry on certain days after 6pm (open until 8pm) but it's not really a secret so expect long queues. Madrid itself is a lovely city and if you can manage the walk into the centre you'll probably find it quite rewarding (if not a little tiring in the heat of early summer). It probably just lacks a signature building that is instantly recognisable. Although the Metro is useful if you need it, it often requires changes to get where you want as it seems aimed more at the Madrilenos than any tourist trails (which is ok) and it can be a bit of a drag (literally) to get your luggage from the airport to the hotel and vice versa. A taxi to the airport would be very expensive I would guess.

Front desk staff stated that the manager made the decision and that he was off for the weekend and could not be contacted. They suggest that we open the windows. The hotel had a wedding party that spilled out to the terrace below many of our open windows, firecrackers exploding at 12:30 a.m., alot of noisy attendees,etc. Also the t.v. was small and pracatically mounted on the ceiling...difficult to watch.

Both mornings the hotel was very unreliable with wake up calls. It was either too early, too late or not at all according to the tourists I talked with. The breakfast was nice BUT the hot food was served much later than the cold selections, and was not even hot! Tables were not cleared and set quickly enough, a lack of sufficient staff. Our room phone was not working and service responded 6 hours later. Our room safe was locked in the open position, and although reported on the first day, service did not arrive to correct the situation. The hotel is clean and nicely appointed but located a little distant from the main attractions other than the museum, and required some form of public transit to reach most of the favoured sites like the Plaza Mayor neighbourhood.", "Date": "April 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, especially for the price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1505489", "Content": "I booked this hotel through the Hotels website for the amazing price of $90 / night (taxes included). The hotel is terrific, with clean attractive public spaces, and a great room with brand new beds and a very nice bathroom. Hotel restaurant was also very nice and a good bargain.
