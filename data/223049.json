That meant that we wanted a place that was close to the airport and since we knew that we would not be spending a lot of time in the hotel we picked the LAX Radisson. This time we used Priceline to get our hotel room and I think we got a good deal. I was a little leery because there were many mediocre reviews because of the construction but when we arrived all seemed to be okay. The hotel is a little dark and dingy looking but I think it is mostly just terribly old-fashioned like a hotel from the 80's. Check in was fairly fast at the LAX Radisson. I am not sure if it is because everything is brown or golden coloured or if it is because it looks a little natty but I am not overly thrilled with this hotel. The price was excellent and the location is very good. We got the room for $67 on Priceline and I think that makes it okay. We got settled in the room and the first thing that didn't work was the tv set. Then Marla found the place to insert the key to make the power stay on. Then once it was on there was some issues with getting a clear TV signal. The hotel's repair person came up and did the best he could at re-attaching a cable. Very European and you don't lose your key. Marla needed some rest and I needed some exercise so I walked up to the Ralph's and CVS about a mile away to get some milk, yogurt and peanuts. It was a really nice walk with planes landing overhead every few minutes. I also took this time to rent us a car. There is a car rental place in the hotel so I went to them first. It was kind of a no brainer deal since if I parked the car at the hotel from another company it would cost and additional $25 per day. But the local place covered the parking. Also, I think because they needed the business they changed the rental charges from $210 for the two days with full insurance coverage to $120. I was okay with $60 per day for a car rental. The room itself was nothing special. It has sleep number beds which give some variety but are no big deal. The beds did not really work all that well, very noisy and really not a big difference. We were on the sixth floor so traffic wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an issue. The windows were really kind of grungy and hard to see through but the view was mostly hangers and planes at the end of the runway. The best part of the view is to watch the pillars at the entrance to the airport change colours throughout the night. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat or drink at the hotel but the facilities looked nice. It was too cold to try out the pool so we skipped that too. The biggest downfall for me was that the shuttle is not all that direct. It is the same shuttle you would get from any of the airport hotels on a 30 minute circuit. It worked out fine though for getting us to the airport at 4am. We used the express checkout because it was just too early to think straight. I would stay at the LAX Radisson again. It was easy to get to, nice people (especially their concierge), clean and comfortable.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA tale of 2 visits\u201d", "Author": "CuthbertK", "ReviewID": "UR127166664", "Content": "We recently made 2 layover trips to this hotel, which we booked for price reasons & had stayed here happily before. The price is a good \u00c2\u00a330-40 cheaper than many other LAX hotels and nothing was drastically awful, but they were certainly 2 different experiences Trip 1 - great. Lovely big room, no noise, free wifi, sleep temper beds ( don't quite know how it works but you can change it from hard to soft mattress), nice toiletries, good shower, room service breakfast looked so tempting we nearly ordered it; free shuttle great; check in and out great friendly and efficient. Trip 2 - not so great. Had paid for deluxe room, didn't get it, so had to go back and be re-allocated ( which was done efficiently by the front desk). We had had to wait a really long time for the shuttle - though a tip, the Courtyard at Marriott is just opposite this hotel, so you could always grab their shuttle too. Room stifling hot, and we just couldn't get the air-con to work to make it colder. We had looked forward to booking a breakfast, but there was no details of any of the room service food in the room at all. In fact the only details of any services were in a very shabby brochure that was falling to pieces in the room. And I couldn't find out any information, apart from my bill, on the guest services part of the TV menu. Of course I'm sure I could have called the front desk to ask for one, but, us being tired and it being late, I just couldn't face it. Room size, wifi, and bed was good as before, but a series of little niggles really made this stay a disappointment when we were looking forward to enjoying the hotel a bit more as we had a longer time to spend there.

The staff were friendly and helpful and one nice feature is that you can check the progress of the shuttles on a screen which tracks them using GPS. You also get free WiFi throughout, something the Sheraton doesn't offer. I would normally rate this place as 3 stars but we got a very cheap rate for one night so I've raised it to 4 stars.

However must be said, that the Box always delivers on the price-value basis. The rooms are classic LA size, large, sufficent, free wifi, absolutely no frills but with comfortable beds, working bath amenities and reasonably clean (even though worn a bit). There is also a basic restaurant, ok wine offer for about 10US a glass, Starbucks fair for the morning and a basic fitness room. No luxuries through and through but in the end, the Box delivers espc. if you catch a rate below 120 US. Although it is the closest hotel to the Airport the rooms are quiet and if you insist the hotel is even accesible by foot (as usual in LA there are no sidewalks but worth taking the walk timewise espc. if you land at T7 - United terminal). The hotel shuttle is free as it is custom in LAX, the only snag is that the Radisson, out of all hotels in the area, has the longest (about 15mins) waiting times for the shuttle which on top stops at the Crowne Plaza before taking you to the hotel (plan to spend about 30 minutes Terminal to Lobby). I personally prefer the Sherator next door, but the rates there usually go above 150 US which is no deal for the difference and a little sexier feel you get over there. If you are on budget and expect solid service I\u00c2\u00b4d sugest the Radisson. Unlike the Sheraton they also put 500 miles on your Star Alliance card if you have one. Stayed there about 10 times, never experience any real problems.

The lobby was lovely but the rooms and hallway were a little worn. Our room on the 8th floor was clean and well-appointed but the carpet was worn throughout the room and actually frayed and torn at the door. The hallway carpets looked old and appeared to have stretched as there were bunched creases down the length. We had two double beds with the sleep number system that appeared to not work, but the beds were very comfortable and the linens luxurious. Having had an long day, we decided to go back down to the bar for a snack and cocktail,. We ended up choosing to eat in the restaurant and it was the highlight of our stay--the atmosphere was very relaxing and pleasant, the service exceptional and the food good--a little pricey (two soups, two salads, bottle of wine, one dessert, $85 with the tip) but to be expected in an in-hotel restaurant, I just didn't expect it to be good. We had breakfast delivered to the room (fruit, muffins, coffee, $12.50 each.) The servings were abundant and delivered on time, which was important as we had left minimal time between our wake up call and needing to catch the shuttle for the airport. The shuttle runs frequently from a back entrance with benches for waiting, both of which were convenient. Our pre-flight stay went off without a hitch and at a reasonable price.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Asheville, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201caverage\u201d", "Author": "bludaizie", "ReviewID": "UR125193917", "Content": "We had an early morning flight combined w/jet lag so the no hassle 10 minute shuttle ride to the airport was key and went off w/out a hitch for us.

The general manager must certainly have taken a tight hold because they treat you like you are at a St. Regis instead of an airport box. No task was too small for them. I received an upgrade due to my gold elite status and the room was two rooms: a living room and couch in one and the heavenly bed in the other.

We wanted to stay here because the rooms appeared to be affordable for the location near LAX, for our early morning flight the following day. We arrived in the evening to check in, and all was fine with concierge. We went up to our room, to find a slightly dated room with an average bathroom. It was about what we expected for a room at this price. We were starving and decided to order room service. My friend and I both ordered a burger well done, fries, and two waters. My other friend ordered a salad and a water. The list price was not available for bottled waters, but we assumed that bottled water wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be very expensive. Bad assumption. The waters turned out to be close to $6 a piece. The burgers we ordered appeared to be a bit pink in the middle, but we were hungry at this point and decided we would have them anyway. My stomach was slightly gurggly subsequent to this, but I figure it was just my food settling. Also, we assumed that a room with a Deluxe Sleep Number Bed would provide a comfortable sleep, but upon lying in bed we found that the beds, upon adjusting them for increased comfort, actually inflated just like a thick balloon. This was not comfortable, but we were ok with it as it was just for a night. After all, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be in Mexico the very next day at one of the finest hotels in the region (got a great deal on SkyAuction) sipping cocktails on the beach. A pink burger, expensive water, and air mattresses were something I could get past. However, early in the morning, I was awoken by stomach paing, followed by vomiting. I thought that something just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t settle on my stomach, and that would be the end of that. Well turns out, I vomited again\u00e2\u20ac\u00a65 times. Clearly my stomach was trying to get rid of something I ate. By the time I had vomited for the 5th time, it was clear that I would not be boarding a plane, and I needed to go to the ER. So after vomiting bile, I made my way downstairs slowly with the help of my 2 friends, and we went to the ER. And of course I vomited again on the way there as we sat in traffic for an hour. Needless to say, we missed our trip, re-scheduled the flight, and moved back our hotel stay, only to find that I would have to go back to the hospital later that night. The first doctor indicated that this could be food poisoning or the stomach flu, but was leaning toward food poisoning as I was vomiting bile the last couple of rounds\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6he did indicate though that it is difficult to distinguish between the two types of sicknesses. After I went to the ER for a second time due to continued stomach related problems, the ER doctor indicated that the reason for my problems are attributed to a food bourne bacteria, and I would need to take antibiotics. After the antibiotics, I was fine. I asked if it was impossible to get a food bourne illness even though my friend had the same thing, and he said that the food itself is not always the source for this type of illness, but it can also be the PREPARATION of the food\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6in my mind this means, hm\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6dropping beef on the counters, floors, or sneezing/coughing without washing hands, then subsequently handling food. The only thing I ate all day was the burger from the Radisson. The reason I say all of this is to convey the doctors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 statements to me, and the rudeness and lack of appropriate and professional customer service. The same name SLunquist that is responding to these messages about individuals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 poor experiences is the person who has given us lip service, attitude, and made accusations and false statements (some of which would need to come from a licensed physician) which I have never experienced before when dealing with hotels. I have stayed at MANY hotels and had a few problems, but never have I dealt with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153professional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who has acted SO incompetent and unprofessional. All we have asked for is the room service money back that we paid. We are not asking the Radisson to pay for the cost of the non-refundable hotel in Mexico that we lost because of the food poisoning ($900). We have asked that the cost of the room service be returned ($80). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all. She has told me and others who have called on my behalf, that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possibly have gotten food poisoning because me and my friend had the same thing. I believe such a statement normally needs to come from someone medically qualified to issue such opinions. She has also said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At this time we are not able to refund any money to (name of friend) as it was not food poisoning.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stephanie, is that your medical opinion? Because the last time I checked, you did not examine me, nor do you have the proper credentials to do so. She has interrupted my friend on the phone numerous times, has been rude and confrontational, responding to every statement we make saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not my fault\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not my fault.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Really?? Where does the Radisson hire their staff? She also indicated that I HAVE to have a doctors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 note as proof indicating that it was 100% without a doubt food poisoning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would have been more than happy to refund the requested if the back up requested was presented. Please let me know if you do receive a note from the hospital or doctor as they all keep records of visits specifically stating the cause of illness.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite submitting documentation from my first ER visit, she needs something that says it was 100% without a doubt food poisoning. First of all, hospital records which indicate patients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 diagnoses are private and are not subject for distribution. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the law. Even doctors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 notes that you bring to work, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have private diagnoses. She claims that in order for a refund to be considered, they need documentation showing it was food poisoning without a doubt. In my mind, it would make more sense just to be hospitable and to give the (small) refund without the hassle and invasion of privacy. If she, or the Radisson, took their caused illness to me seriously, then they should have tried to just put out the fire and then I would have respected the Radisson enough, like I have with other hotels which have made concessions for far less drastic and serious reasons. But instead of that, she would like for us to have to be inconvenienced (as if being sick and having to recover for many days and missing my two week, hard earned vacation wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough of an inconvenience), by getting a note. If I have to get a doctors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 note, it will be coming through as an exhibit in a legal deposition, as I sue for the $900 I lost on the hotel I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay at due to the food bourne illness I got due to the Radisson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negligence. Folks, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste your time staying here, because the incompetence of staff like Stephanie is mind boggling and will leave you wanting to do more than anything possible to spread the word about how terrible this place, and especially the staff, really is.

That being said, we found the rest of the room quiet and clean with a comfortable bed. The bell hop named Dewayne came quickly to get our suitcases the next morning, waited on a cold rainy morning to get all our luggage on the airport bus and was VERY friendly.

Our room didn't smell of smoke but smelled musty and moldy, like there had been a leak that hadn't been taken care of. The coffee provided in the rooms was terrible. It tasted like grounds had been moldy or rotten or something. Both my husband and I agreed that it was the worst coffee we had ever tasted. Not a deal-breaker, but pretty disappointing when you have to get up at 4 in the morning. The shuttle taking people to the airport was supposed to run every 10-15 minutes starting at 5 a.m.. That's what the front desk and the signs across the pickup area said multiple times. We got downstairs at 5:12 and didn't get a shuttle until 5:45. The man waiting with us was late for his flight (was actually thinking he would miss it) because he had been downstairs just a few minutes before 5 needing to catch the first shuttle, which never came. We prepaid for our room online, but two days later noticed an extra $22 charge from the hotel on our credit card. When I called, they said that was the parking charge that we had somehow not paid for when we checked in. WE DIDN'T HAVE A CAR THERE! We had dropped off our rental car, got a shuttle to the hotel, then took the shuttle to the airport.

They were wonderful and very very accomodating. The food provided at a food bar in the lobby was surprisingly good. I am not one for buffet style food, but it was actually very good and fresh. They used a lot of organic products and provided a huge array of fresh, alternative drinks like smoothies, wheatgrass, fresh squeezed juices, coconut water, and many more. Room service was great and was provided 24/7. Good for us as we were up at all hours of the night. I think may hotels would have a hard time accomdating this many people....especially this crowd, but they were super organized, prepared and ready to made changes as needed. WE also used all of their conference rooms for \"lectures\" and \"clinics\" and the mainballroom became a huge yoga practice room. Excellent facilities! THe rooms themselves were standard fly-through hotel rooms. Decent enough, nothing really stood out. The only drawback I could find in the rooms was the ventilation in the rooms....I doubt anyone staying there a night or two would even noticed, but when you are there for 2 months and have wet laundry drying in your room (we had to wash our yoga clothes out by hand most of the time in the sink for time's sake and by choice-the hotel provided washers and dryers). Our thermastat didn't seem to work. We had maintenance check on it several times, but apparently the problem was never resolved..it just got very very stuffy and humid in the rooms. I heard that they were going to remedy that as many rooms had the same issues. Again, if you are thinking of staying here for a few days, even a week, this is your place. Other than the ventilation, which is not the staff's fault, it's awesome! Other pros: -Car rental facility on site (separate from the Radisson and provide very very low rates)-II rented a car almost every weekend for around $36 TOTAL for one day with taxes and insurance. -24 hour shuttle to the airport -Separte shuttle to Manhattan Beach, which inlcudes stops at the Mall (with all your basic department stores, Whole Foods and a ton of restaurants) -There is a Trader Joes, a regular grocery store, like Safeway, two CVSs with 24 hour pharamacy, a medical clinic for walk in injuries/sick, Bed Bath and Beyond, 2 Starbucks, Panera Bread etc. -The local bus can get you anywhere from the stop near the hotel..I took it to Santa Monica..was a straight stop no changing of bus. -Krispy Kreme doughnut kiosk located inside the Crowne Plaza (about a 10 minute walk down the street -an awesome sushi kiosk located in the Crowne Plaza-some of the freshest sushi i've had and i've had a lot--it's a lone guy that prepares the sushi to order -he is only there from 5/6-10pm M-F or something along those lines. -The pool at the Radisson is heated -They have a bar/lounge in the lobby that servies food until 1am or something like that. I had the best burger ever there... Again, the stafff....EVERY SINGLE PERSON, whas wonderful! They take customer service to another level.

We arrived in the early hours, very tired, and looking for a room, and were advised by the night staff that they had just had a cancellation. Despite the fact it was 01.30 in the morning, the reservation assistant was adamant that he could not include breakfast or reduce the rate. We were also advised that we would have to pay a $22 valet parking charge! After some negotiation and dismay with this and the room rates, we were given a very small discount. How I wish we had found another hotel. We approached our room to find dirty glasses and coffee cups lying in the corridor outside, and it went downhill from there. Inside the room, we found a half consumed meal and bottle of water in the fridge, biscuit crumbs on the chair and table, and a 'sticky' pest control device underneath one of the beds. Far from there being a 'cancelation', it was clear that the room had recently been used and not been serviced. Only one coffee cup and water cup remained, there was no laundry bag, no glasses or cups in the bathroom, and the beds had not been made up properly. These were the almost forgiveable aspects of the airport Radisson. The completely unforgiveable, centred around the grey and stained net curtains, the stained bed linen, the cracked sink, the wallpaper peeling off the wall, and the socket hanging out the wall. The room was shabby and tired, with old fashioned furnishings, cathode ray TV, and was certainly not what I would expect for nearly $300. Added to this is the audacity to charge $22 or parking, and the valet parking service provided by individuals who openly tout for tips. Unfortunately, having travelled far with a half asleep eight year old, we were far too tired to take issue with the room that evening. We raised our disappointment the following morning with the reservation manager, Gandy, who was clearly dismayed at the situation, and offered an immediate reduction. We appreciate your efforts, Gandy, but this Radisson hotel needs to address the fundamentals of hotel value and service provision. I have no doubt that our room had been 'double let', having probably been used for a 'day let' or airline crew, and to then charge nearly $300 for an unserviced room is unacceptable. However, what is also unacceptable is the standard of rooms being provided at premium rates. This hotel has obviously seen better days, and needs a substantial refurbishment, but there appears little incentive so long as there is a lucrative airport traveller catchment market.

Courtesy shuttle runs every 15 minutes :) Terrific and helpful staff - also NO airport noise (maids on the other hand - we had a late checkout, peeps kept calling our room at 10 am and hanging up) left room to have a smoke and noticed someone took do not disturb sign from door) they were also yelling at each other in the hallway. Other than that - Daniel at the front desk was wonderful at checking - restaurant and bar staff excellent (as was food). Don't use sleep number beds if you are not used to them! Takes more than one night tio figure out \"your number\" - and waking up was painful.

Called the front desk, and they sent a bellhop up right away with another room key. Went to the new room, turned on the TV, and it wasn't working. I went down to the lobby to get a new room. Benny was working the desk- he took my key and gave me another room- he commented, \"I think you will like this room.\" And he was right- a beautiful suite on the top floor- spacious living and dining room, great features- big screen TV, etc. We enjoyed the room very much! I appreciate Benny going above and beyond the call of duty. One downside- no self-parking, only valet. But the lot is only a short block away, so not that big of a deal.

The first occasion there was a long queue at reception to check in and check out. No assistance offered with luggage, despite it being mid afternoon check in. Reception staff courteous, not overly friendly, unhelpful. The king single room was very small and bathroom shabby. Ordered one meal and hot drink from room service. After 35 mins the meal arrived sans drink. Was told if I wanted it I'd have to wait another 30 mins as the room service attendant was busy with other orders waiting. A hotel of this size with only one room service waiter? Next morning (after flight from Aus) had a Zzzz sign on my door but room attendants didn't take any notice - really noisy out in the hallway with doors slamming regularly. The fitness centre had no towels provided and only 1 of the treadmills was working. The second occasion (prebooked which is why I went there a 2nd time) there was again a long queue at check in (midnight), the lobby bar was being used for a function so it was packed with people, again no assistance offered with luggage/no trolley provided. I asked for a quiet room. Got a larger room this time with 2 beds, but the bathroom was a shocker. Had to hold the sink taps when using them as the whole mechanism was loose in the vanity casing. There was pubic hair on the toilet when I arrived and hair in the shower. No paper cups let alone glasses in the bathroom, and the coffee cups in the room are paper. Neither of the beds had an operational sleep system (which Radisson so heavily promotes). Could hear the TV next door and doors slamming until the early hours of the morning. The wallpaper was very marked and the old aircon unit had water stains on the ceiling next to it. The concierge didn't know how to get to the the nearest shopping centre by public transport and made a big deal of having to look it up on the internet. Huge queue for check out and the shuttle bus was late going to the airport - the staff basically couldn't give a toss and told me that it was a 3 minute walk to the airport! (if you look at Google maps you'll see that you have to cross freeways etc - great with suitcases - not!). That 3 minute walk, mind you, would've cost me US$20 in the hotel \"limousine\" (a regular sedan). Overall this hotel needs a massive refurbish and the staff need to be trained in basic hospitality etiquette. They're either lazy or understaffed - can't work out which. The only plus is that despite it being so close to the airport you can't hear the planes - however the noise in adjacent rooms/hallways will make up for it!!

This hotel is the closest one to the airport, literally next door, so if you wanted to walk over, you could. The hotel also runs a shuttle every 30 minutes to LAX, though ours ran late so you may want to allow a bit of extra time. We were checked-in quickly, and without problems. This hotel was procured on Priceline and we were able to check-in at noon. We received our request for 2 beds, and much to my delight, they were *not* Sleep Number beds. The front desk made no mention of this at check-in, and I'm wondering if they are being removed from the chain's hotels? The keycard still prominently displays an ad for the Sleep Number... The room was nicely furnished, in typical Radisson ways. The beds had nice mattresses and plenty of pillows, though I had to call down for a foam one. Our room also included a desk and TV stand. Bathrooms were also regularly furnished and designed. There was also free wireless internet in the room, which is always a great addition. Airport noise could sometimes be heard in the room, especially during the day though rarely at night. We enjoyed the pool area on this trip, though it was a little hard to find (we had to ask). There is a sign pointing to a sitting area in the lobby with the words 'Pool' on it. We found out that you have to go through the door to the outside, walk to your left around stairs and a parking lot and you will see the white fence that encloses it. It was never busy and had lots of lounge chairs, though the second day we went down there were no towels until after 11am, which was a bit inconvenient. Parking was available at the hotel under two different options - $15 for self or $20 for valet. We coughed up the extra $5 to have them park it for the night, though it looked like self-parking was relatively close by. The hotel also contained a restaurant, which we did not sample. Overall, our stay was good. I find the LAX area to be cheap and mildly central when it comes to going to different areas in Los Angeles.

On this trip, my older parents also from the East were joining me in the desert. I usually stay at the LAX Marriott but since its rates were suddenly crazy high and the Radisson was reasonable, the 3 of us booked at the latter for 1 night - two rooms, different names. My flight wound up 3 hours late and was difficult; when I arrived at 8:30pm, all I wanted was a room, food, some TV and a chance to get myself together before I left at 7am the next day. Since my former employer had a corporate arrangement with Radisson, I am familiar with their strengths (some) and weaknesses (many). Here's what i experienced: --I believe I was given the missing room from \"The Shining.\" It was missing a large piece of art from the wall - I know this because there was a print hanging over 1 of the 2 beds and 2 large hooks and a blank space over the other. It had a large floor lamp meant to solely light 1/2 the room, specifically where my luggage was meant to be unpacked - which had a burned out bulb in it. The TV had no reception whatsoever. The standard coffee machine was missing. I spent the first hour of my time there dealing with the front desk (when they stopped putting me on hold), housekeeping and the engineers to get these basics. Even with the engineer working on the TV and getting a picture, it came in and out throughout the rest of my stay. (I work in TV so having a functioning one is a basic necessity to me.) I also called the desk to advise them that I had a room with missing framed art, so they didn't accuse me of taking it. The woman I spoke to couldn't dismiss me fast enough. --It's understandable that the hotel has had to cut costs due to the economy. So face washcloths are gone, pens are gone. OK, no problem. But no bathmat for stepping on out of the shower and no rubber shower mat (or nothing attached to the tub floor to prevent slipping)? I had 80-year-old parents with me and I worried about them slipping in the tub. H-ll, I was worried about me slipping in the tub. This might be a cost savings but it's also an insurance risk. --Bookings were all screwed up. While that's normally just a headache to work out, it became extremely problematic when I tried to leave messages for my parents about my flight delay, to tell them to have dinner early without me. For some inexplicable reason, the hotel put both reservations under my name - despite the fact these reservations were booked separately and our confirmation paperwork showed the distinction. I finally instructed the very confused operator just to leave the same message on both rooms so they would be covered with whichever room they were given when they checked in. My parents received no message so they waited. --Let me offer a few good things. While the hotel is probably the closest on that strip to the airport (a plus) and right on a busy road, it's well-soundproofed on the outside. Not so much on the inside; noise carried from the hall including some very loud partiers at 2am. Room service was solid - decent selection, fast service, nice staff - and that's fairly consistent at all Radissons. Ask for a room facing the airport and you'll be entertained by the gorgeous outdoor artwork (giant pillars of changing lights) that greet arrivals at LAX. But there is a general lack of good management at Radissons. With probably 20-30 visits at various Radisson hotels over the past decade, mostly in the west, they are always just a big off: rooms are often missing basics, burned out lightbulbs and dead batteries in tv remote controls are frequent, standard things are not there. two days into a weeklong stay at a Radisson, the housekeeper amazingly threw out my hardcover book on my nightstand...then when I asked them to check their trash area (which turned up nothing) and then reimburse me, they accused me of lying about the book's existence. A few times when I travelled under the corporate arrangement, I found welcome gifts from the manager(s) in the room upon arrival: the fruit plate left for me once had mostly overripe mushy fruit, and when I was sent a bottle of wine the 2-part corkscrew that came with it had only 1 part. These are all symptoms of poor oversight and lack of accountability by staff. So while the Radisson LAX room was clean and the room service was decent, it required more work than should be needed by a guest staying there for a one-nighter.

Third-party prices fill rooms, and provide the business with opportunities to sell services and win future customers. My advice to Priceline customers: pay attention to reviews, articulate your needs clearly (both in advance and on arrival) and speak directly and immediately to management if your expectations are not met. If basic room needs are unmet and you bought from Priceline, ask management for adjustment; if unresponsive, tell Priceline in writing; use snail mail to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s street address and direct to Customer Service VP. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found them responsive. Talk to local management directly and pleasantly: they value meaningful guest feedback and often can use information you provide to correct persistent problems. Whatever rate you paid, be courteous and civil to a fault: it never helps to be confrontational. Commend with care what is commendable.] OVERVIEW and COMMENDABLE: For airport convenience, and if you don't need to park a car, this large (500+) hotel is tops; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s situated at Century and Sepulveda, right at the LAX entry. An airport shuttle runs every 15 minutes. Management was promptly responsive to my pre-arrival inquiry about parking, guest laundry and refrigerator. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a top-story lounge with a great view. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 24-hour room service, a fitness center, outdoor heated pool and free wireless internet access that (a) works and (b) loads with reasonable speed and is easy to access. I was situated at my request near the guest laundry, which is small but reasonably priced and efficient. The room was adequate but outdated; upper level rooms are better quality. Bedding including pillows was very comfortable. Despite proximity to airport, and facing Century Boulevard, my room was very quiet. QUESTIONS: It may be possible to check-in online 7 days ahead of arrival; an employee told me guests who do this are often upgraded, which means a nicer room and nicer bedding (floors 5-8 and above). An attempt to research this at the chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website turned up a dead FAQ link. PROBLEMS: The hotel seems to cater to groups more than to individual travelers. Of course, this makes economic sense. The touted lobby concierge is often absent, and long lines at check in are common. The hotel operator and front desk seemed overwhelmed and telephone inquiries (made necessary by the absence of amenity information from the room information guide) go unanswered. At check in I asked for a refrigerator; a crib was delivered and it took about 30 minutes to correct this. The services directory claims newspapers will be provided each weekday at your room, but this does ot happen; USA Today is at the front desk. Hot water runs slowly. Parking is a disaster: (a) $20 a day, plus taxes. (b) It is operated by a vendor, Quality Parking. (c) Valet is the only option. You are given a ticket, which you retain for your entire stay. The car is retrieved by presenting the ticket to a cashier station. (d) You then wait, and wait, and wait. I made the mistake of giving the valet my ticket one day, and he made the mistake of not telling me to keep it. This error, which was eventually corrected by cross-referencing my room number to the car, cost me 1.5 hours of waiting, calls, and frustration almost to the point of calling to report the car stolen. At one point, the cashier asked me to identify the key--of a rental car, from among hundreds in the case. Had I been on an important schedule, or needed to retrieve the rental car to return it, I would have missed my connection.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "York", "Title": "\u201cNot a good start\u201d", "Author": "Blackcat2york", "ReviewID": "UR49722983", "Content": "Things didn't start off very well on our one night stay here, although the room rate was good value.

Same thing applied to check out 2. some people might think parking is a problem, guess what, LOT C parking is just 5 minutes walk from the hotel. it is cheapest you could find nearby i guess. For first two hours parking, it is free, after that, a dollor every 2 hours, and the maximum you pay is 10 dollors for 24 hours (no tips, no tax). we are tourists, who will park there for 24 hours?? LOT C parking is just awesome, free shuttle to the airport too. 3. Room Amenities: we were staying in a stardard room on level 5 non-smoking. The bed was pretty comfortable. i don't really like the coffee maker, and no tea bag was provided, but whatever. room is big but the bathroom is rather small. They provided shampoo, conditioner and body lotion, the funny thing is there is no shower gel, instead they provided body soap. one more thing, i love the mirror in the room, free wireless internet is awesome 4. Im not sure about the business centre, swimming pool and gym, because we didn't have time at all to use them. However, the ground level looks newer than other levels 5. food around hotel might be a problem. on the first day we arrived after 20 hours flight, we were so exhausted that we slept until midnight. Since we heard about in-out burger, we walked down there, which was about 15 minutes walk. Further down there was a Ralphs supermarket. Only later on we realised we could have gone to the food court located at tom-bradley terminal, although there was only mcdonald's after midnight, but i get better choice 6. Public transportation: I thought it was not too bad, just takes long time to get where u want to go. we didn't rent car for the whole period, so for most of the time we had to take public transport. To go to santa monica, it is really convenient, big blue bus take you right there, and the bus stop is just 5 minutes walk. Since my partner loves santa monica, it is also good for us. There is bus to downtown and venice beach as well. If you want to take train, it is also easy, go to the airport, take the shuttle, and there u r at the train station. If you want to save money, these are the things you have to sacrifice! one little useful tip, if you go to metro local website, type in wherever you want to go, they give you all the details ( this is what we don't get back home in melbourne) I think that's pretty much all the useful information. I didn't regret at all for staying at radisson. Santa monica is nice, but way too expensive.

We had about 24 hours of travel behind us and had not eaten in almost 20 hours so we really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to wait to get another room. We decided to just get some food and go to sleep. We had another 12 hours of travel the next day. We got changed, had a shower and walked down to get some food. What a shock. The restaurant food is so expensive. Entr\u00c3\u00a9es started at 15 USD. Crazy. Main Meals were anywhere from 25-45 USD. We asked at reception and were told that there was another restaurant on one of the higher floors but it was more expensive than the one we were just looking at. I cannot imagine how much more expensive, we just went back to our room and ordered room service. We called down to order, the gentleman taking the order was very nice however he did advise the meal may take 45minutes up to an hour !!!!! Pretty crazy to be honest. But we just said fine. 50 minutes later we got our food and were told the food may be a little cold as the lift\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were not working and only one was in operation so it took the guy a while to get up with the food. Ok we understand the lift is not the guys issue, but the cold food was his issue. I found it pretty wrong that they would openly bring you cold food and admit it and charge you full price and expect a tip !!!!!!! Not on. Keeping in mind that by this stage we had not eaten for about 21 hours and when we asked how long before we could get HOT food, we were told 45 minutes to an hour. At that point I just laughed and ate my cold burger and fries. Unfortunately , during the night the air con broke down. All of a sudden our room was a sauna. It woke both myself and my partner up and we did everything we could to try and turn it back on but it jus didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. It was 3am and we had to get up at 8am we just tried to go back to sleep but it was almost impossible. Unfortunately It was a very bad stay. For 80USD a night, it was just poor.

There was a pool but I can't really comment on it as we were too busy sight seeing. I needed to print some tickets while I was there and the concierge did this for me with no problems and I found all the staff to be very efficient. I didn't eat at the hotel as we mostly ate in LA or at the nearby subway. All in all I found this to be of much better quality than I expected. For the price I was expecting something similar to travel lodge in the UK but the rooms were much bigger and there were more amenities.

The switch to the AC was broken off so we had to use a pen/hanger to push the button, wall paper is peeling in bathroom, vents are filthy, and wall plates for light switch are broken off in parts. This was all topped off by the horrible service in the lounge which we requested our check 3 times, and waited 20 minutes total to get finally. I've literally stayed at MOTELS that were nicer. I think the \"discount rate\" was still too much for the quality or lack of quality at this hotel. It's definitely left a bad taste in our mouths and I feel sorry for those who are tired from traveling and paid full price for the quality they receive. We will not stay at a radisson again.

Not having to drive back and forth was worth the stay regardless, but make no mistake, this is primarily a business-type of hotel. Upon arriving, the parking lot was under construction and valet was the only option for hotel parking. Being the starving college students that we are, we opted to park in a near-by lot for airport parking, which worked just fine. Check-in was a breeze. The staff was very friendly and we were allowed into our room a good 45 minutes before the listed check-in time of 3pm. The Saturday we were there was also Final Four day, and we had allotted time to watch both games in the room before going on with our evening. The television reception of CBS 2 was tolerable at best, but thankfully, with the hotel's free internet, we were able to watch both games in high-definition on my laptop. Our plans for the night in Culver City got canceled, so we were left with the frenzied task of finding something to do in the area without a car (parking lot charged more for ins-and-outs). This is no knock on the hotel itself, but there isn't much to do in terms of nightlife in the general vicinity, and that wouldn't be a problem for most guests of the hotel. We opted for a little bit of a cultural experience and wandered LAX for a few hours topping it off with a late dinner at the McDonalds in the international terminal. A real fun experience, to be completely honest. We got back to the hotel around midnight and the lobby was empty. Almost creepy. Again, that comes with the turf. Looking back, The Custom hotel a few miles north would have been a better option had we known our plans were scrapped. PROS - Nice, modern rooms with super comfortable beds and good air conditioning. The view was also great. We requested a runway view and got quite a bit of amusement out of that. The two double bed set-up didn't feel nearly as cramped as i've experienced in other hotels. The biggest pro, hands down, was the sound-proofing of the place. The double-pane windows let NO sound in whatsoever even though planes were coming in constantly a few hundred yards from our room. CONS - The elevator system was laggy and confusing at times. This may have been fixed by now. Also, out of boredom, we tried to locate the stairwell. found one, but it was downright creepy. rusty pipes, dark, and odd stains and splatters on the walls. Again, nothing that was too big of a deal, and the hotel was/is going under construction. One more thing was the pool area. Because of it's vicinity to the airport as well as Sepulveda blvd, the pool and spa area was very noisy (nothing anyone can do about that, obviously), but when we arrived, there was nobody out there midday on a Saturday. That, combined with the 70s, horror film architecture of the pool area and the imposing Eastern-European looking office building in the background, turned us off from taking a dip. Overall, though... it's a great hotel for anyone traveling in or out of LAX... especially the closeness to the airport, the quiet rooms, and great prices.

I checked in with no issue and found the front desk helpful and enthusiastic about their SleepNumber beds. So far, so good...until the elevator bank. It took longer than normal for the elevator to arrive, and once it did it was small, and bounced upon arriving at each floor. I figured it was just the one elevator I happened to choose, only to later realize this was not the case. Having returned my rental car earlier in the evening, and not caring to dare to explore the area around the LA airport by foot (not recommended), I thought I would check out the restaurant fare offered at the Radisson. Much to my chagrin, the Palmira restaurant downstairs off the lobby looked like too heavy a menu with a weak wine list, the lobby bar didn't have enough food, and the heavily advertised \"Top of the Radisson Lounge\" was amazingly disappointing. So they took the same menu from the Palmira bar, replicated it on the PH floor, (again, elevator issues up and down, one elevator wouldn't allow me to punch PH, the other bounced on the way up,) and the way the restaurant is structured, they created frosted glass walls obstructing views of the runways, and there are about four tables that have a decent view in the entire lounge. Kenny G blaring through the speakers and the weak menu made me leave before ordering to return to the Palmira. I ordered salmon and it came served on what looked like a hash brown patty (frozen/reheated) on top of frozen corn. They do an incredible job with smoke and mirrors - the decor, lighting and ambiance may lend itself towards an upscale restaurant, but one look at the wine list and a taste of the rubbery shrimp, and I wish I had stayed in my room and ordered a pizza. All that said, the room itself was not bad. It appeared clean, did not have any funny smells, and was highly functional. The SleepNumber bed was interesting, though not by any means an incentive for me to be persuaded to return. I did not try the high speed internet, and was disappointed the next morning when I received push-back from the front desk upon attempting to check out over the phone. After challenging them, they agreed to allow it and email me my receipt, but acted like it was a chore. I have yet to receive the receipt... The kicker, and the reason why I cannot fathom a reason to stay at this Radisson again was, you guessed it, the elevators. I mentioned earlier that there was clearly a situation the night before, and there were several hotel staff, even one person claiming to work \"for the owners\" on the elevator when it was bouncing up and down on each floor, with the doors closing in mere seconds of opening upon arriving at every floor...yet, NONE of the elevators worked the next morning. Walking down the many, many flights of stairs (with luggage in tow) arriving at a door with arrows pointing to it stating \"LOBBY\" and, at the same time marked with: \"ALARM WILL SOUND WHEN OPENED,\" I took my chances and opened the door. Alas, no alarm. I shot out the door and barely made my departing bus for the airport. I would not recommend this hotel for the seasoned business traveler.

The reason we stayed at the Radisson LAX is because it was close to the airport, reasonably priced and a brand name... It was perfect in location... we had 3 days in LA and you can't ask for a better location.. 15 mins to Santa Monica & Venice Beach (day 1 of our adventure) Day 2 we headed into LA and did all the sights - approx 30 min drive and very very easy to drive to... Day 3 we headed to Universal Studios... If you are not going to be in the heart of LA for your stay why stay there with their over ex-y prices, expensive car parking etc. The staff at the Radisson were extremely knowledgeable and printed out MapQuest directions for every destination we went to and step by step directions on how to get back to the hotel. They have a huge amount of local knowledge which was great for us, especially as this was the first time we had driven in the US. Car parking at the hotel was $13US per night - but we knew this anyway and was really cheap compared to everywhere else. Other reviews are spot on there is no noise from the airport, it is clean, spacious room. Our shower was the worse thing - it trickled, but when we mentioned it to the Front Desk they offered to move us straight away... Not the friendliest hotel staff, but definitely huge amount of knowledge which is what we needed.

My first trip is unmemorable to me now, but it must have been good enough that I decided to try it again. It's not a bad hotel by any means; rooms are very clean and generally comfortable, but on coming into the room, I noticed it was a little warm. I went over to the thermostat -- which was literally disattached from the wall -- and tried to cool things down from the 75 on the readout to a more comfortable 68 or so. The thermostat itself is very similar to the one in my home, so I knew how to adjust the settings, and no matter what I tried, there was no indication that it was working. I left for the evening, hoping it would have kicked in in the interim. When I returned, the room was still in the mid-70s, so I went down to the desk to request either a new room or a repair. After waiting in line (at 11:45 pm! The desk invariably had a line), the clerk assured me that they'd send a maintenance man up to look at it. I went back upstairs, and sure enough, within a few minutes, the maintenance guy appeared. I pointed out the unattached thermostat, which he re-screwed to the wall, then he climbed a ladder to look at the air conditioning's innards. After a few moments examination, he assured me it was broken (I had gotten that much myself) and that they would have to tear it apart to repair it right. He suggested I tell this to the desk and get a new room in the morning. Aftter he left, I did indeed to back to the desk (another line!) and was finally told by the same clerk that they were fully booked (given the crowds in the lobby at that time of night, I believed him), so the room-switch was out. He immediately asked what he could do as a make-good. I said I didn't know, so he offered me a free breakfast. Not a lot, but he was trying; I'll give him that. I went back up to the room, and while it was still about 73. it wasn't awful, and I was able to sleep soundly. The next morning, I told another desk clerk that I wouldn't be needing the breakfast, but that I hoped the room would be repaired. When I returned late that evening, the situation was the same, but again, not to the point where sleep was difficult. Other than that, I have few complaints. The shower is terrible, but I've come to expect that in hotels nowadays.

Since we had made the reservation on line, we tried to find a computer to borrow to cancel the reservation on line, but could not find one. We then called American Express operator and explain our problem, they could not cancel our reservation. We then ask the operator to record our problem. All these phone calls cost us over $50. When we got home we asked American Express to reverse the Radisson $162.00 charge. Radisson refused to refund the money claining we did not cancil within the 24 hour period. It is impossible it they don't give you the support or have the employees who can cancil your reservation. They sure know how to take the money before you come.

They did change rooms promptly into a double with minimal fuss. The hotel is clean and looked like it was recently renovated with new carpet and furnishings, but somehow still had an \"older\" feel to it. The lobby is very nicely appointed and visually appealing. The bed was one of those inflatable sleep number beds where each side was suppose to be adjustable for comfort...needless to say the bed didn't work and everytime I tried to get up or down my wife would either sink to the bottom (whenever I got up), or she would get bounced out onto the floor whenever I got into bed. By the end of the night the air in the bed had deflated and we had sunk nearly to where the box spring would on a regular mattress...horrible night sleep. The biggest complaint I had was in the elevators. We literally waited 20-25 minutes for an elevator going down.

I chose this hotel because it offered free shuttle service to & from the airport. Great feature. Having never been to Los Angeles, I asked the hotel Concierge, by the name of Tim, to direct me in the easiest & most economical way to get to the port. Tim was exceptionally friendly & helpful & informed me that there was no shuttle or bus service, that a taxi would cost me $150 & that I was better to take the \"Limo/Car' service offered through the hotel for $120, but would give me a deal at $99. As that appeared to be the way to go, I booked the car service to not only take us to the port, but to pick us up when we returned from our cruise as we were staying another night at the Radisson before returning to Canada. Throughout the cruise as we talked with other passengers, we learned that there is indeed a shuttle service from hotels to San Pedro & that the taxis advertise $53 from LAX airport to the port. I was extremely upset over this & felt I had been taken advantage of by the concierge. Due to a delay in the ship clearing customs, we did take a taxi back to the Radisson & it only cost us $57!! To cut a long story short, both Tim & the car service apologised for the misleading information I was given & did not charge me for our initial ride to the port for our cruise. We did hire the car service & a driver for a 3 hour sightseeing tour of LA. This was very expensive at $65 an hour & of course had there been more people to share the vehicle the expense would have been less. But we really enjoyed having a personal tour guide. The rooms in the hotel were large & beds very comfortable. So all in all, I would certainly recommend the hotel & the car service.

We found the hotel very inviting both from the outside and lobby area. The desk staff was very business like but curteous. The check-in went smoothly and because we drove to the hotel the clerk explained the parking proceedure and daily charge of $13.00. The parking garage( 2 levels) was behind the hotel and quite large. Hotel guests were able to park on the lower floor. With a validation ticket from the front desk you can leave and enter the parking area at no extra charge. Our room,# 901, was on the south side of the building wilth a view of the hightway entrance to the airport and runways. The only problem with viewing the sites was the window was dirty and with the sound material on the window it was hard to see a clear view of the outside. The room, or more accurately, a roomette, was below average size. With one king size bed, a small table and chair, and furniture for the tv, there was not much room left to move around. The bathroom was very small with very little counter space around the sink area. The room and bathroom needed a good cleaning and updating. There was a cigarette smell that was quite noticeable in the room and bedding. There are 6 elevators for the hotel floors. Going up is ok BUT going down from your room can be a 2-3 or 4 minute wait for a going down elevator. Obtaining breakfast and dinner, at a reasonable price, at the hotel was impossible. They have one restaurant, which appears to be their signature restaurant, with very high prices. (one small box of cornflakes = $4.00) Dinner for two without any drinks or dessert was $ 55.00. They had a breakfast/lunch room but it was closed for what ever reason. It appears that management is going after the business traveler with their pricing structure. The gift shop also had very high prices. Staying at this hotel would be good if you drove to L.A to fly out of LAX. The facility appears to be set-up for this business and from what we saw many, many people are using this service.

When I tried to check into the hotel I was informed that the computers were down and that I would need to wait an hour for the computers to come back up. After waiting for 1 hour in the lobby I proceeded to check in. I went up to my assigned room only to find that when I opened the door there was a female guest screaming. The room had obviously already been assigned to someone else. I returned to the lobby, explained the situation and was assigned a new room number. I entered the new room to see that all of the bedding and curtains were old and very faded. The room was clean however it was not a comfortable room. I pulled out my laptop to connect to the internet received an error stating that there was a problem with the host. I called the front desk to inquire about the problem. They said they would send an engineer to my room to take a look at the problem. The engineer arrived promptly. After performing a few checks he determined that there was a problem with the jack. He explained to me that they often had problems with the internet in certain rooms. He offered to change my room. I agreed. We went to the new room only to find that the Internet did not work in that room either. The engineer told me to stay in my original room. He gave me a phone number to call for their tech support. I called and spoke to the tech support. He told me that he would advise his engineer and then send him to fix the problem. Nobody ever came. After waiting several hours for a response I called the tech support again only to be told that he couldn't help. I then decided to order a pay per view movie. After selecting a movie on the screen and agreeing to payment the screen went black. I called the front desk and explained the problem and they said they would send an engineer. The engineer arrived promptly. He looked at the TV briefly before offering to change my room. I explained that I would move only if they could ensure that the pay per view would work in the new room. I did not want to move all of my luggage again. The engineer said he would go test the system in the new room and then call be back with the info. I never heard anything back. Another troublesome fact about this hotel was that everytime I went to take the elevator it would take literally 10 minutes before the elevator arrived. I do not understand why. I was at the hotel for 3 days and this happened every day! In summary, this is an old hotel that offers an uncomfortable room, and an incompetent staff with zero accountability. If you have a problem they will keep refering you to someone else until you are told they will get back to you. After reading other reviews, this hotel looked promising.

I can't blame the hotel for the number of clients using the shuttle, but in consideration of the number of clients and the time it takes to transit the terminals now, an additional shuttle bus should be considered. Check-in was fine, but that's because I was first off the bus. I'm sure the 10 other guests would not have agreed, considering that there was only one person doing check-ins. The hotel now has new carpets, but that's where the upkeep seems to have stopped. My matress was worn out, and I was surprised to see that the sheets had major holes in them. As the hotel uses low quality institutional grade polyester blend sheets, the holes were quite evident. The purported internet access in the room was not available and the TV internet option was useless. (speed and accuracy of the infrared device was poor.) So much for this being a \"business\" type hotel. In fairness to Radisson though, the room was fairly clean and there were decent sized soaps and shampoos etc. in the bathroom.

We were the closest hotel to the airport and had high hopes for getting to the airport in plenty of time. My husband travels often and has never had an experience like this. It took 45 minutes to get to the airport! Most of that was spent waiting for the shuttle along with a growing crowd of passengers and large amounts of luggage.

Locating the hotel shuttle was not a problem and the driver was very helpful with bags. Check-in went smooth and the front desk attendant was very pleasant, but seemed unsure how to process the hotel and food vouchers that were issued to me by my airline because of the missed connection. We were given a nice room, comfortable bed, but had to call the 'Guest Services' about the internet service. They sent some engineers up to work on it and they got it working - with my ethernet cable I travel with, not the cable provided by the hotel. We chose to use our 2 dinner vouchers in the hotel restaurant downstairs (Palmira Bar and Grille) and was very, very displeased with the level of service we received. The watier was impatient and dissapeared after taking our order. The food tasted great, but upon requesting the check, the waiter then decided to bus the table (very aggresively and noisily) right in front of us as we finished the last of our drinks. I had notified of the food voucher before ordering and told the waiter I would like to charge the remaining (i.e. tax & tip) to my room. We finally got it settled when he opened another tab on the room for $0.02 and then I added the tip (I was just flying in from overseas and didn't have cash). The breakfast vouchers specifically said they could not be applied toward room service purchases. However, breakfast didn't start in the hotel until 6:00am, and our flight was departing at 6:27am. I called the 'Guest Services' to see what could be done about this, and they authorized for use of the vouchers for room service. So we attempted to order room service at 2:30am (we were still on Asia time). It said the service was 24 hours, but we called 5 times over a period of 20 minutes before we finally reached someone. Order was taken promptly and delivered in just the same manner. It was well prepared and tasted good. The vouchers were presented to the attendant and the remaining balance was paid for in cash, not charged to the room. Upon check-out early that morning at 4:00am, the front desk manager told me their computer systems were down and they wouldn't be able to finalize bills. He told me there was a balance of around $40 for room service remaining and I told him about the food vouchers we had used for room service. He assured me it would be no problem and when they system was up and running it would all be worked out and they would email me a copy of the itemized invoice after that. Four days later I still have not received anything from the hotel, and they still charged my card for an amount I have no idea what it relates to (i.e. no itemized invoice to detail).

The room was fine, there was an ironing board, which was very handy. I think the rooms are perfectly adequate. The lobby was very nice and spacious. The surroundings are very lovely, with palm trees and a great view of the multicoloured cylinders that form the entryway to LAX. The rooftop bar? Awful service. We were there and it was not packed, but the three guys they had working there were __BUSY__ the entire time, and we could not get a drink. Eventually we got a round and some food, but then, we couldn't get the bill! I mean, seriously, this place is a great location with fine decor, we would have blown tons of cash drinking at the hotel bar if only they had any service. We ended up walking down to the Sheraton and enjoying the ambience there. Those guys can run a hotel bar, know what I'm sayin? Oh, the $12 martinis we had that night. How wonderful they were. So that really ticked us off, I mean we're buying $13 martinis and we can't even get service. For someone from Minnesota, you think $13 martini might mean decent service, but no, not anything like it. The breakfast was adequate to mediocre. Satisfactory. Your basic hot-trays of scrambled eggs and bacon, unartistically presented, yawn, with a few attendants running about trying to get everyone coffee. Ho hum. When getting off the elevator, you know the little sign that says \"201-221 -->\" and indicates which way your room is? Well, the numbers were falling off and you had to use trial and error to find your room. The hotel is very close to LAX, but there is no point in walking there. Even at midnight the little bus was running. And it would have been a pretty hazardous walk. So, it's pretty obvious that our ridiculous experience at the hotel bar pretty much ruined our stay at the hotel. That might seem petty, but sometimes a single detail, like non-existent service at the hotel bar, can just blow a whole stay. And it did, for us. Would never stay there again. The Sheraton is nearly as close, and those guys have a bar AND a sushi restaurant. That said, if you are a conventioneer, don't stay at LAX unless you are already renting a car. There is a mandatory taxi fee that you will incur, anytime you go to/from your hotel.

We stayed one night Feb 27th and found the hotel to be OK nothing exciting but we were just looking for a place to crash before catching an early AM flight back to Boston. When we arrived at the hotel the \"self\" check in was full and as I had 2 kids and 88 yr old Mom with me I found this very inconvenient. The valet guy was not particularly helpful at first (who wants to wait on a middle age Mom when there are limos lined up everywhere) as it was Oscar night but he valet parked my car for an hour so we could check in before returning the car to Hertz. On check out they wanted to charge me for valet parking (something like $14) until I reminded them that the \"self\" was full and I didn't have any options. Check in was somewhat of a nightmare as the system had \"crashed\". It seemed as though the system must frequently crash as they had a system worked out with walkie talkies and paper cards to determine who got what room. Truly bizarre! We had to wait about 40 mins to be given a room. There were 4 of us so no we couldn't snuggle into a king bed room!! I had booked at the Radisson for the pool & hot tub for the kids but we had a hard time finding it and it was so dark and scary that they wouldn't go near it. The room was quite small though it had a good view of LA from the 9th floor with a little airport noise but not bad. They did quickly bring a rollaway once I reminded them about it. Come to think of it I don't think they charged me for the rollaway. We didn't pay much for the room $69 so that was a plus and we used room service which came pretty quickly and was fairly reasonable and tasty. They had a very big room service menu with lots of casual choices which was great for the teenage kids. I didn't frankly feel safe enough in the area around the hotel to walk outside with an older person and kids to find somewhere else to eat and besides we wanted to watch the Oscars on TV! The shuttle worked out well and the staff was generally friendly. I was surprised that they did not offer express check out though. If you can get the room at a cheap rate then I wouldn't hesitate.", "Date": "March 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood, convenient arrival hotel\u201d", "Author": "mopezone", "ReviewID": "UR3224640", "Content": "I'm a bit puzzled by some of the bad reviews posted about this hotel. We arrived after a very long flight with a pre-paid (very cheap!) booking made in England. The hotel shuttle from LAX was prompt, quick and courteous. Check in staff were friendly, smiley and got us rooms that we wanted without any bribery (I think Americans call it tipping!) probably because we were friendly right back at them. Because we were travelling with teenage kids they gave us rooms with a connecting door which made life much easier. The rooms were spacious, clean and quiet, with great views of the runways, although soundproofing was so good that you couldn't hear the planes. We stayed for 3 nights and found everyone extremely helpful and the hotel very comfortable. I've only given 4 stars because self parking was $12 a night and frankly it should be free, and also because the shower in one of our rooms was temperamental and not up to the fire-hose standard that we expect and enjoy in American hotels. Not so bad that we had to call for service, though. Check out was simple. I'd certainly start here on my next visit to LA, and I might even stay here for the whole time, as with the freeways it's a pretty convenient location.", "Date": "February 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Az", "Title": "\u201cA MUst Place to Stayt\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3106908", "Content": "This Radisson has the absolute friendliest staff of any hotel in Los Angeles.

The shuttle that picks you up at the airport was adequate; the lobby of the hotel was very nice. The checkin process was efficient given the number of people checking in at once. The room however was adequate at best. The furniture and the carpeting looked like they were ready to be replaced. The bathroom was rather small and standard. One major drawback was the lack of a coffee pot in the room. It seems that most hotels now do include a coffee pot in the room, even the Super-8 style motels, yet the Radisson didn't.
