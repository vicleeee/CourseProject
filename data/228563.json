The room comes with a mini-bar and there is room to store some drinks/items of your own. We had breakfast in the hotel on our last day (the other days we wanted to get out and explore as soon as we got up) - the food was excellent with a great choice. Again the staff were helpful and accommodating. The hotel is ideally located - a short walk from the metro, bus and tram and ideally placed for the FC Barcelona Nou Camp stadium. The front desk were extremely helpful and knowledgeable and pointed us in the right direction on each occasion. They also provided excellent recommendations for local restaurants.

Also, the door to the toilet was opaque glass that didn't quite close all the way, so if you are a stickler for privacy while on the john you might have a problem.

Negative points: A little outdated, in need of refurbishment, I would tend to say it is a good 3+ stars A little pricey for the comfort offered (paid 150 e for single use) No pay per view channels on the tv, noisy heating, internet not stable, poor choice on the minibar, no bathtub but shower.

Apparently, you must insert your key card into a socket to work the light switches. It would have been great if someone told me that when I checked in...Instead I called and the hotel staff acted annoyed that I did not know this. A few minutes later, I went back to the lobby to ask a question. After waiting for 15 minutes behind one couple chatting about where to go and what to do, the front desk person asked if he could help me. I asked if they have an adapter as I forgot mine and right away just said NO. \"Is there somewhere else I may find one?\" I asked. \"El Corte Ingles, but it is closed now.\" I returned to my room to use my computer on its battery. When I booted up, the \"free\" wireless required a username and password that must be secured at the front desk. Back down 11 floors to ask for this. \"Unfortunately, our system is down.\" said the front desk person. \"I will call when it is up.\" An hour later he called with the username and password, at which point it was 11 pm and I was in bed. Trying to sleep was no easy feat. The walls in this hotel are very thin and you can hear everything in the room next to you. The housekeeping staff wears heels and is up quite early moving furniture and running around making noise. The room is pretty small, though the view is nice.

Before I tell you my experience I'll let you know about the rooms. My husband and I stayed in the Junior Suite, which compared to other hotels is not that expensive. The room is small for a suite, but the living area and bedroom was divided by sliding doors which was nice. Aside from the bed being huge and oh so comfy the rest of the room was average. The couch was old and not very comfortable, but it had a pull out bed which is good for groups. The rest of the decor was nice, but not that impressive. We had a great view of the city. Mind you, the hotel is not near the center, but long walking distance from some of the sites like Casa Piedra. The bathroom was small and there was no tub in our room. One plus for the hotel is that it provided free internet! The interesting part is that the first day we were there the maid walked into the room without knocking or making herself known. It was awkward because we were changing at the time. That was embarrassing and my husband was mad and called to complain. The day when we were leaving I was taking a shower and when I reached for my towel there was a giant cockroach climbing my towel. There are three things I have a phobia against: heights, needles, and cockroaches. I almost tripped over myself screaming trying to get out of the shower. I have gone my entire two weeks in Spain without seeing one and this was great end to my trip. Finally, the hotel prides itself on being a hotel for the business class, but has the most out of date business center. My husband went to make a copy of our tickets and he took a long time because they were operating still on Windows 95, the oldest version of Adobe, and a tiny printer that did not worked well. That was a big disappointment. One very impportant tip, if you order the Ceasar Salad you will be sorely disappointed because I ordered a Ceasar Salad and it tasted nothing like a Ceasar Salard.

There is a seperate huge shower, which once you figure out how it works is fantastic. There are plenty of guest amenities, including nail polish remover, first time I saw this in a hotel. On the downside, there was a maintenance door in the toilet that kept slamming in its locks, I fixed it in its place with a shower cap. Furthermore, the TV remote didn't work too well anymore. The windows of the rooms open to let in fresh air, which is great. Also there were plenty of power sockets to plug in smart phones, laptops and all other travel electronics. Even though the breakfast is extremely high in price, the quality is great. Good juice and excellent coffee from a Jura machine. Plenty of choices in bread, cold cuts, etc. I'm not sure if they fry eggs or not.

The hotel was very clean both in the room and reception areas etc. The room had THE most comfortable bed I have ever stayed in, and we had 3 great nights sleep - the bath was a bit dark but you don't live in the bath. Staff were very helpful giving us advice on tourist buses, taxis etc. We didn't use the bar or restaurant so I can't coment on those but they looked fine. Overall the hotel is very nice but is in the business district of Barcelona and is a little out of the main areas, if I was staying again I would look for a hotel in either the Port area or Baria Gothic area as both are good areas and very central. Watch out on the Las Ramblas area, by day its a pick pockets paradise and by night it becomes very seedy with lots of \"ladies of the night\" looking for business. The tourist buses are a great way of seeing everything in a weekend but they can get very busy.

If you don't mind a longer walk, many attractions were within easy reach on foot. If booking this hotel, we would strongly advise that you request a room on a high floor, as the views across the city are wonderful, and there is no problem with noise from the busy road. Another tip is to cross the Diagonal to a small cafe named TEO for breakfast. Their charges are very good and offer a great breakfast at a 1/3 price of the hotel's one.

Firstly, when booking directly with the hotel, the reservations lady was very reluctant to send me email confirmation and didn't ask for a credit card number to guarantee the booking. I booked at very short notice (the night before my arrival) so really wanted something from the hotel in writing before I left the UK. I never got my email but I did eventually (after 3 calls to chase it up) get a reservation number. The room was fine, perfectly adequate, if a little small. It was generally clean, apart from a few hairs on the bathroom floor and a rather fusty smell in the toilet cubicle. Although it was a non-smoking room, I have a sneaking suspicion that it had been occupied by smokers quite recently. On the plus side, the bed (or should I say beds - two large singles pushed together) were really comfortable and ensured a very good night's sleep. The staff was pleasant enough, although not overly welcoming. The bar is nicely laid out, although for 2 nights running we were the only 2 people in it. One thing that I did think was very cheeky was the fact that, despite offering 2 computers for guests' use in the business centre, I was asked to pay \u20ac5 for half an hour's usage. This should be free of charge. The location of the hotel is very practical and there are several decent eateries close by. There is a Starbucks just around the corner (not that you necessarily go to Barcelona to go to Starbucks, but it is a quick and easy breakfast option...) and in the basement of the nearly El Corte Ingles is a well-stocked supermarket. We went to a restaurant called Daps which was good value, served tasty food and had a lively atmosphere (just opposite El Corte Ingles). All in all, the hotel provided us with a good base to explore Barcelona. It could have been better but in general it was perfectly satisfactory.", "Date": "August 2, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hesperia Presidente", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d228563-Reviews-Hesperia_Presidente-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$112 - $280*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Avda Diagonal 570</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08021</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> (Formerly Tryp Presidente Hotel)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "228563", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/92/26/9226d80b404ffb925eec5c0d3d55ed826large.jpg"}}
