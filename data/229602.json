We had a lovely twin room which over looked the typical French street and we had a terrific view of the Eifel Tower as well which looked great at night. The Hotel was so easy to get to from the airport - Roissy Bus, metro from Opera to Ecole Militaire and a short walk. The area the Hotel is in is very nice and it's only a short walk to the Tower and the Seine. We bought a 5 day travel pass which meant we could travel from the airport and all over Paris on bus, metro or train. We used the busses a lot just hopping from stop to stop, and the bus stops are very near the Hotel. I'd highly recommend investing in a pass - just don't lose them as I did as once they're gone, they're gone! I'd also bought a Museum pass for 2 days which in hindsight I could have done without. It was great queue jumping at the Louvre, but to get our moneys worth we tried to fit in as much as possible and probably missed out on half the Louvre. Next time I think I'd just get an advance ticket for the Louvre and spend a day in there! It's stunning but so big! The staff at the Hotel are so friendly and helpful. I loved staying there, nothing is too much trouble. There was a fridge in the room which I used to store the many bottles of wine I bought from the supermarket! All in all I loved Paris, and the French people were so friendly and helpful - especially those that helped sort out the cheapest replacement travel tickets! We went back to the airport on the train and this wasn't as good as the Roissy bus. One or two beggars, crammed to the rafters until Gare de Nord, but quite pleasant after that with musicians playing for us! Will I be back? I hope so! Will I stay at the Hotel Relais Bosquet again? I couldn't imagune staying any where better!

My wife and I are in our mid 30's and we stayed here for 7 nights. I've travelled to several hotels in the US and a few in Europe and I can honestly say that this was the friendliest hotel staff I've ever encountered. We felt a little bad that we didn't speak more French, but all of the hotel staff spoke very good English. The hotel was clean and quiet. The rooms were large for Paris standards, especially for the price. The location was absolutely perfect. It was a 10 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and 2 blocks to the Metro Station that you could take to any place in the City. It was a great metro station location because we never had to make more than one connection to get to the sights we wanted. The restaraunts and bakeries in the area were wonderful. The breakfast at the hotel was quite good also. We loved the Rue Cler area. While we are younger, we don't enjoy the very loud, party scene. This area was perfect because, it was busy during the day, but not overwhelmingly crowded. It was quiet during the night. The restaraunts and cafes were good with good variety. The only very small negative was that the beds were a bit stiff, but we still both slept well. The one thing I would recommend is that perhaps they rotate a couple of dishes on their hot buffet. Something like quiche would have been nice once or twice a week, perhaps a special dish on Saturdays or Sundays. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone travelling to Paris.

The staff were very friendly and helpful and answered all our questions to the best of their ability. We had to return our key to the front desk each time we left the hotel, which was a little different, but not a problem. There was always someone at the front desk when we returned, so we didn't have to wait to get it back. We stayed in a superior room and it was comfortable and clean. The beds were very comfortable, and the room darkening blinds made it easy to get a good nights sleep so that we could make the most of each day. Keep in mind that the hotel rooms in Paris are smaller than what North Americans may be used to, and this is the same pretty much anywhere you stay.

The apartment is located on Rue du Champ de Mars in the building right next door to Le Bosquet restaurant. The apartment was cosy, spacious and well equipped. Unlike most serviced apartments, the kitchen had just about everything you'd ever need to prepare meals. Condiments and leftover food from other guests was also left on the bench for use, which proved very handy for us. There is an excellent artisan bakery on the corner across the road from the apartment (you'll see it when you walk back towards the hotel), which is great for picking up fresh bread and pastries for breakfast. Cheese shops, delicatessens, butchers and greengrocers are all just around the corner on Rue Cler and also on Rue Saint Dominque. There are also a couple of supermarkets and wine cellars very close by and the metro is just around the corner. The bathroom includes a washing machine and drier, as well as a bath/shower. There are two wall beds in the lounge room and a double bed in the master bedroom with adjoining courtyard. Since we were there in winter we didn't use the outdoor courtyards. We could imagine that the courtyard next to the lounge and kitchen would be a very nice spot to enjoy meals in the warmer months. There is a computer in the lounge cupboard if you need to use the internet and also free wi-fi. The apartment is cleaned and given a linen change every three days. The staff were incredibly helpful and arranged our transfer from the airport as well as booking us a table at Le Florimond for New Years Eve dinner. They were more then happy to provide recommendations for other restaurants in the local area and book you a table. There are plenty of great restaurants in the nearby area if you're after some great dining experiences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it just pays to book ahead or try and be in the door before 7PM.

My advice is to consult with the hotel through their Facebook page, which they seem to monitor regularly. Bernard made a reservation for us at a restaurant several days before we arrived, and I can see that they have done similar things for other guests.

I like the feel of quiet residential neighborhood and close proximity to good restaurants that lined Rue St Dominque and Rue Cler. For our 3rd visit to Paris we decided to get a nicer hotel closer to Rue Cler and after much research settled on Relais Bosquet due to the positive comments about customer service. In that regard I was not disappointed. The customer service was top notch. The front desk was very polite, and took care of business with class. Rue Cler is about 1/2 block away and the hotel is very close to the very rustic but good value Cafe du Marche. Unfortunately I did not know it at the time, but Rue Cler is a bit dead on Mondays. But during other days you can really pick up a lot of nice supplies for a picnic lunch or snack - from raw oysters to pates to fruits to cheese to bakery to chocolates to ice cream. A foodie heaven to sum. Rue St. Dominque is another street that is packed with nice shops and restaurants and about 10 minute walk away. We went to Fables de la Fountaine and Cafe Constant and they were both very good. The hotel was really 2 residential buildings transformed into a hotel. The is a hallway that connects the two on the ground floor. As a result, the elevator is miniscule (fits 2 person and 2 suitcases), and the staircase is narrow and not advisable to use. Partially due to the retrofitting, our room is a bit peculiar and a disappointment. It was a very large room by Parisian standards, and it was decorated nicely and very clean. But the toilet was in a tiny room next to the bed, and there was no sink near it. So every night we had to go through the ritual of going to the toilet, and then run across the room to go to the shower/tub/sink in the bathroom at the other end. Not fun. Lastly, the sound travels. One night on our floor, the kids (apparently in a different room) kept knocking on the door of their parent's room, looking for toothbrush and such. We could hear every word.

After reading reviews for this hotel and comparing them to other similar 'star rated' ones, I decided to book with Hotel Relais Bosquet and am so glad I did. Everything is excellent - the location, the accomodation, the service. To reveiwers that say they expect more for what they paid - THIS IS PARIS, of course it is abit more expensive to alot of other places. Just like visiting New York, Sydney, London: expect to pay alot more than what you'd get at 'home'. We've stayed at many Ritz Carltons and Westins, but we were still impressed with Hotel Relais Bosquet. This is a nice, small, quiet hotel in a safe, convienient location. We booked the superior room with the Eiffle view as it was our first visit to Paris and we were celebrating my birthday as well as New Years. Because we later extended by 2 days, we had to move to a no-view superior later which didnt bother us. The staff made it easy by allowing us to leave our luggage in the room and moving it for us when the 2nd room was available. We found the superior rooms to be comfortable and spacious for our short time spent in the room. It was nice having the Eiffle view but it really is no biggie as you will hardly be in the room. Also liked having a separate toilet to the shower. The 1st room had the shower head on the side of the bath which was abit arkward but nonetheless not a big deal. Superior room bathrooms are big. Housekeeping always did a good job at cleaning the room daily and replenishing toiletries and towels. Also liked that the rooms had slippers (usually only find these in 4-5 star hotels). The rooms are also equipped with a safe, blackout blinds, tea/coffee, mini fridge, iron, reading bed lights and flat screen tv (yes I found a few places with box tvs still and not all these amenities). The room also has a heater and a separate air con unit. The air con unit is however turned off during winter so if you are like my husband and still sleep with the air con on during winter, then you will have to open the windows. Luckily even during NYE celebrations, the area was still quiet at night for a sound sleep. Another plus is the free wifi you get in the room. Not readily available in public areas as you may be used to from home. Location is safe and excellent - bus stop and metro a short walk away, the Eiffle tower about 10 mins walk away and so close to many good restuarants, bakeries and shops. Service - the staff are all so excellent. All very helpful, friendly and patient, even the grave yard shift staff. You tend to be abit more 'free' whilst on holiday so it was good when theyd remind us of safety: pickpocketers, late night travel on the metro etc. They made our stay alot easier. I wish I knew all the monsieur names to mention them. It was nice knowing at the end of the day, we were returning to a quiet, comfortable, clean hotel with friendly staff in a safe, convenient location - we will definitely stay here again.

The price was very reasonable considering we had an entire studio apartment to ourselves. The apartment was very clean and had a full kitchen (no oven) with washer/dryer and Murphy beds.

Furthermore, she also helped arrange our tickets for Moulin Rouge, and adivised on a place to buy Louvre tickets in advance and avoid the long lines. I refrained from complimenting her too much as the wife may not have been very appreciative of that, we were in Paris for her birthday! The other staff was also very friendly and always willing to help with directions and any other queries. The room was very clean, comfortable and cosy, overlooking a courtyard, with motorized blinds on the windows to keep out the light. The bathroom was decent, except for the european style of half-size screen doors for the shower, which sometimes lets water splash out, and the shower being mounted on the side wall (instead of at the end), which can be an awkward angle at times, but not a big issue as such. We had the breakfast once, and it was excellent quality, though not a bargain. As noted by many other visitors, the location is super - the Ecole Militaire metro stop is five minutes away, there are two bus lines two minutes away, and the RER rail line that goes direct to Versailles is under ten minutes. There is a small convenience store two buildings away, and a small Carrefour supermarket a block away. The Rodin museum is a ten minute walk, as is the more popular Eiffel Tower.

This is a smaller, charming hotel in a great location: Rue Cler, just around the block, is packed with little restaurants, cafes, bars, a supermarket, cheese shop, bakery, etc. The Eiffel Tower was a short walk away, and the metro station (Ecole Militaire) is about a block and a half away. We took the metro everywhere (museums, Sacre Coeur, etc); the metro was fairly easy to figure out, but when we were confused, the people of Paris were so helpful, stopping on their own to help us when they saw us looking at the metro map in confusion. The Hotel itself is a wonderful value, very clean, with the most comfortable bed and pillows (very important to me). The rooms had everything we needed (flat screen tv, a/c, electric window shutters, safe, etc. The hotel even had free wifi service in the lobby. The staff was very accommodating both before and during our trip. Christian and Frederika answered all of our questions via e-mail before the trip; Frederika arranged shuttles to pick us up from the airport and then to the TGV station when we departed. We walked to the Eiffel Tower twice, once on the first day we arrived and later, on our last night in Paris. We took a boat tour (starting near the Eiffel Tower) that takes you down the Seine at night. It was a magnificent ending to our trip, seeing all the lights of Paris, and especially seeing the Eiffel Tower all lit up at night. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel because of its cleanliness, comfort, and location.

We planned our own trip, bought our own tickets (air and rail), and, with advice from friends (local and those good advisors on TripAdvisor) made our own hotel reservations. The Relais Bosquet was excellent in every way. (We did choose the deluxe - or larger - room size and glad of it.) We managed to see many of the museums and churches we had wanted to see. And we did take a day trip to Giverny - easy and worth doing. We also enjoyed walking around and dining in the Rue Cler area (where the Relais Bosquet was located). Our only difficulty was with the travel in country, and if I'd asked more advice from Trip Advisor, I probably would have spared us some anxiety (I didn't know how to find the right rail car when we took the train from Paris to Avignon, for example.) We managed the local transportation well. The buses are convenient and we used them quite a bit. Taxis are expensive, but we used them a good bit, as well, since my wife has knee and foot problems. We usually had very little trouble getting cabs - and only one really surly cabbie. We took a very expensive dinner cruise on the Seine. Next time, I would skip the dinner cruise and take a late afternoon/early evening cruise so to see the sights better and to see the lights come on. Dinner was excellent, but detracted from the sightseeing. We did take in a concert at St. Chappelle - a beautiful church/stained glass. Worth doing! We rented a car in Avignon and drove to St. Remy - a charming town. We stayed at L'Amanderie in St. Remy when we were in Avignon. It is not nearly as fancy as Relais Bosquet, but it was quite adequate. The hotel Trip Advisor recommended in St. Remy was full, which is why we stayed where we did; next time I'd try to stay right in downtown St. Remy - lots of very good restaurants. A HIGH POINT of our trip was hiring a tour guide for an all day excursion around Provence. Our guide was Laurent Catoni (<allprovence@gmail.com>). He picked us up in his van at 9 am and dropped us off back at our hotel at 6:30 p.m. We saw, among other things, the Pont du Gard, Avignon (center city, Pope's Palace, etc), Rousillon, a paper mill on a river which produced 'hand-made' paper from old cloth - a wonderful day. Laurent is very pleasant, knowledgeable, and accommodating. His English is excellent. We could not have seen and done all we did in Provence without him. We did manage on our own to tour Arles and we also found an olive grove and press business driving around on our own and had a tour of the whole place. A GPS in the car made that all quite easy. Advice from Trip Advisor travelers that we get to a hotel near the airport the night before our noon flight back to the states was very good advice.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mandeville, LA", "Title": "\u201cNice small hotel in a good location\u201d", "Author": "Rickster63", "ReviewID": "UR119109477", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here in late September.

We didn't have breakfast at the hotel because there are lots of bakeries, restaurants and grocery stores right next door and around the corner on Rue Cler.

Housekeeping did an exceptional job daily. The Superior room we stayed in was wonderful. Spacious (plenty of room for 2 adults), quiet, clean and newly renovated. Air conditioned with a big, comfortable bed. We slept very well every night. We used the in-room fridge and kettle and greatly appreciated the complimentary coffee and tea.

It can be a costly trip if you don't try to find the more economical choices. That said, you are in the most beautiful and magical city in the world, so enjoy it! We can't comment on the breakfast as we had our own each day in our room - happily purchased the night before at the Leader Price grocery store on the corner. Yogurt and cereal is our standard and the room's fridge made it easy to do. Do try the italian restaurant Del Angelo at 6 avenue Rapp - it's not too pricey and delicious. About an 8 minute walk from the hotel on the way to the Eiffel Tower. Make sure to stroll down rue de Grenelle and rue Saint Dominique - lots of shops and food stops. Overall, a real value for the money and we can't say enough about the Relais Bosquet. We did a lot of research before booking our hotel and were very pleased with our choice. We would like to thank previous reviewers on TripAdvisor for their honest and accurate descriptions of this hotel. You helped us choose it and we are very glad we did.

We were lucky enough to spend 10 nights in Paris and due to TripAdvisor reviews we booked this hotel for our entire stay. Since our stay was 10 nights, we made sure to book the largest room. Well unfortunately that room was very tight for our 3 suitcases and bags. There is just enough room to walk around the bed to the toilet which is not actually located in the same room as the sink and shower. Now, I do know that is very common in France but to Americans to walk across the room to wash your hands is a bit unappealing. Yes, the room darkening shades are a nice feature but there are some draw backs. You can sleep forever and not know what time it is unless you set your alarm clock (who wants to do on vacation!). And when you do sleep in later housekeeping keeps knocking on the door and actually once opened the door even though we had the privacy sign out. Lastly, you cannot control your own room temperature so when you close the room darkening shades no more fresh air is coming in and the room was very stuffy. Also, we did not find the bed comfortable. I continued to wake up with a bad back. We did pay for the breakfast and wish we did not. It was just breads, with no toaster, and some cheese and cold eggs. We did go to the cafe next door which had many pastries but can be a bit too heavy to have day after day. On to location. Yes it is great to be close the Eiffel Tower which we walked to frequently. In addition, we loved the restaurant Tribeca right around the corner. The waitstaff was great and food delicious. We went a few times!! The hotel is also close to Rue Saint Dominique which is a great avenue (has a Starbucks when you just need a little taste of home). A plus was free internet and good connection! However, since I had not been to France before we did not understand how important Left Bank and Right Bank position was. We were daily crossing over to the Right Bank where the Champs d'Elysee, Opera, Arc di Triomphe, and Sacre Couer are. So after four nights in this hotel we decided later in the day it was time to make a move to a hotel room that was larger, with a better bed, a more American style bathroom, individual room temp control, room service, American style breakfast, and most importantly, a location of the right bank. Since we were leaving later in the day we did get charged for another night since we did not give 24hrs notice but we did appreciate the staff not charging us the full price or the days we did not have breakfast, We were also packing so quickly that we forgot a few items in the desk and the staff thankfully held on to them for us! So when it comes down to it. Staff was great and helpful and for 10nights in Paris we needed a room that had some room! and on the Right Bank.

We had heard that the people in paris were rude. I truly believe if you are a happy friendly and polite person, you get back what you give. I now understand that being polite when asking for something is to say please first then ask for what you want.....in America we say thank you at the end of a request, but in Paris, the people and the children are so polity. They are respectful of each other and the children say excuse me and thank you when asking for something. I had a wonderful experience at a bus stop. The bus we were on came to the end of the line and everyone had to get off and wait 5 min for the next bus. A very nice women waiting next to me smiled and I did too. SHe asked if I spoke French, I said very little and asked her if she spoke English. She said no, but tried to communicate that is was a beautiful sun today. Now the next bus arrives and our tickets should have transferred to continue on the next bus without paying. When the next bus came and we got on , the driver wanted to charge again. She saw we did not understand that we did not have to pay and she spoke in french to the driver to help us out telling him we don't have to pay. It was a transfer. That was the best experience ever. We love Paris!

Cons: The double bed was two single beds put together and questionable method in regards to leaving/picking up in lobby. I will go into more detail about this subject later in my review. In a little more detail of my 3 night/4 day stay at Hotel Relais Bosquet Paris: Upon arrival, we were welcomed and greeted by a friendly staff. We arrived early, but the room was ready to go. As you may already know or have read, a lot of the hotels/apartments/etc are generally small in comparison to what we are used to in the states, but my girlfriend and I found that Hotel Relais Bosquet Paris accommodations, in regards to size, was more than enough. Large double bed (two (2) single beds put together), large and spacious shower/bath and bathroom sink. Hair dyer, iron, television (with several stations in many different languages), mini bar, and electric shade to cover the bright sun from those days you want to lounge around. After you receive your key, you'll have been told by the staff that they would appreciate (and it would be ideal) if you dropped off your key every time you decide to depart from the hotel. While I understand that this is probably for security reasons and to make our experiences more personal with the Hotel Relais Bosquet Paris staff, but there were times when I arrived at the hotel and asked for my room key (from a staff member who I have never seen there) and they just gave it to me. No questions about who I was and such. Now I understand that this would be acceptable if the person I had given my key to was there, but I had never seen this staff member before and he was more than willing to just give me my key. Maybe there is something behind the scenes that I didn't know about that helped them identify us and our rooms, but it made me feel a little uncomfortable at the idea anyone could ask for my room key and get it. Hopefully, the manager/owner of Hotel Relais Bosquet Paris will read my review and address this to clear up any confusion/misunderstandings I have. As far as location, this hotel is perfectly located (in my opinion). While it is not in central Paris, it is only a short walk (~2-5 minutes) to the Ecole Militare metro stop. There are a number of restaurants near by, which all vary in cuisine (French, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and more). Don't want to eat out all the time? There is a small, quiet grocery store just a few buildings down from your hotel. Is that closed? Doesn't have what you're looking for? There is a larger grocery store right near the Ecole Militare metro stop. Need money? There are several banks nearby including Bank of America's sister bank, BNP, which is great for those who bank with BoA. No international fee of 1%-3% every time you withdraw money (ideal way of getting money -- don't use those conversion places unless it's an emergency). Also, the Eiffel Tower and the nearby park is a very short (~5 minute) walk away. It was nice to step out of the hotel, step into the bakery at the corner and buy a baguette from the friendly of Boulangerie Artisanale, and then take a stroll in the park towards the Eiffel Tower. Sit down and just admire the beautiful monument at night or just people watch during the day. Don't forget to leave time to visit the Rue Cler that's right around the corner. Many cafes, restaurants, little shops (bookstores, shoes, chocolate, macaroons, jewelery, etc), and much more. Busy throughout the week, except Mondays where it is a little slower. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to visit Paris in the near future. Not only do you have easy access to the metro stop (order a \"carnet\" if you plan on using it often), but you get to experience a more Parisian lifestyle (aside from being in a hotel). If you have any questions regarding nearby attractions or anything else about the hotel, feel free to drop me a message.

The metro station was very close (3 blocks) and I could see the top of the Eiffel Tower from my bed! Easy walking to all the hot tourist spots, but not in a overly touristy area.

We were stranded in Paris for 3 extra days due to the snow storm that paralyzed Europe this Christmas.

The hotel We arrived in the early evening on the first day and check-in was smooth and the room was lovely. We were in a superior room (room 53) on the fifth floor. The room was much more spacious than I ever would have imagined for Paris and we could see the Eiffel Tower from our window. The road is quiet so no traffic noise and for those who like complete darkness (and I do mean complete darkness!) the electric black-out blinds were amazing, personally the complete darkness in an unfamiliar room didn't suit me but the curtains did a brilliant job of blocking out the light. The guidebook in the room was a nice bonus for those who weren't prepared with guidebooks. The bathroom was lovely with his and hers sinks and a nice set of toiletries and slippers to use. The hotel offers free wi-fi access which I found really useful (although there is internet access in the lobby) and a nice bonus as many hotels are all too keen to charge for it. The staff were all lovely with excellent English and were only too happy to help, whether it was recommending a restaurant on our first night or calling us a taxi on our departure, they were brilliant. The hote also offers a left luggage facility which allowed us to enjoy a full last day in Paris without worrying about dragging stuff round. Unfortunately I can't comment on breakfast though as we didn't try it. The location The hotel is fantastically located on a quiet street which leads onto Rue Cler with its restaurants and markets. The hotel is only minutes away from the Eiffel Tower and between two different Metro lines. The hotel is surrounded by restaurants and only minutes away from a supermarket, with a bakery selling fresh bread and pastries right on the corner. Everything that you could possibly need is nearby.

The maid comes every three days to change sheets and towels and clean the bathroom, and I believe vacuum.

They helped us with any questions we had, booked dinners for us and arranged our transfers. After this stay we will only do apts, we saved a lot by not having to eat out every meal, especially with so many food markets close by. On Rue Cler we had the butcher, fish-person (?), fresh vegetables, bakery, cheeses, pastries and even fresh flowers. This was especially helpful when we had come back from long day trips and all we wanted was a hot shower and a soft bed. I would highly recommend to anyone to consider this if staying more than a couple of days. If we had any complaints at all it would be with the dishwasher. Several of the dishes and pots and pans had to be rewashed before use, it wasn't as though there was food left on them, but they had a slight filmy feeling to them.

My two grown daughters and I shared a three person room which was extremely clean, well thought out (toilet room was seperate from the bath/shower/sinks) quiet and perfectly located in the 7th district, within a very short walk to the Eiffel Tower. The front desk staff were really helpful, spoke perfect English and were obviously interested that we enjoyed our stay. There was also free wi-fi which worked perfectly and a programmable safe and a small fridge in the room. That summarizes the 'pros'. The only real 'con' was the housekeeping. We were quite late leaving the room each day, but I had to chase down towel and toilet paper one night and the following day, the bare minimum was done - trash emptied and beds made but again short one towel. This may be a result of us leaving after noon each day. However on the second to last day, a housekeeping manager came by to check on the room so it appears the hotel is aware of the problem there and is working on it. As I said already, the room was clean, just not stocked. Also, buy your snacks and water etc., as there are many stores in the area to purchase snacks, including healthy ones, and water, wine, beer etc. The prices for these items through the honor bar system border on the ridiculous by North American standards. The real plus point of this hotel is the location as it is half a block from one of the most interesting streets in Paris, namely the Rue Cler. On that street there are many good restaurants, fresh fruit/veg shops, a pharmacy, clothing shops etc. The best coffee in our opinion was at the one crepe shop - we went every morning! Big cups of cafe au lait! Breakfast at the hotel was very good, not just bakery products but scrambled eggs, great coffee, perfect croissants, cereal, yoghurt etc. Best of all, the breakfast went until 11AM which was rare in our experience.

We chose the hotel after extensively researching the areas of Paris and reading hundreds of reviews on tripadvisor. Well, the Hotel is in between the Invalides and the Eiffel Tower; we actually walked all the way to Notre Dame as well (slow pace in under one hour, with several stops for pictures). The area is really nice (I wish I could afford to live there...). Rue de Champs de Mars has a few shops, a lovely bakery just one or two doors away from the hotel, a small supermarket abot 10 meters up the road, and a fascinating cheese shop opposite it. Pass the supermarket and you cross Rue Cler: packed with little restaurants, bars, a greengrocer and whatever you could wish for. The staff at the hotel were always polite, helpful and pleasant. Our room was fine for what we needed (I don't think we managed to spend more than 6-7 hours in a row in there!), with a wardrobe, table, TV, coffee and tea, kettle. The mattress was very comfortable (better than mine at home, according to husband!), and the room also has electric blinds, so even if you are a bit light-sensitive you can get a good sleep. On our arrival we also found a very handy map of Paris on the table, with all the landmarks clarly marked: a very thoughtful touch. The bathroom was spotless and every day it was replenished of shower gel, body lotion. They also provide a sewing kit, a shoe polisher, a nail file and a little vanity kit (make-up remover pads and cotton buds). The fridge was big enough to contain the bottles of water we bought, and more food can be stored in there. There was a safe, and the bedroom was on the inside courtyard, so we had the view of a tree in front of us. Metro stations: Ecole Militaire about three minutes away, Invalides about ten minutes. We ate in three different restaurants nearby, but the one we preferred was the Italian (Di Felice in Rue Grenelle): and that's saying something, as I am Italian and I don't normally enjoy italian food abroad... The area feels very safe, we never felt we had to look over our shoulders, not even walking around late at night. It is a brilliant location also as far as getting to it from CDG. Just get the blue line RER, stopt at St. Michel-Notre Dame, change to the yellow line RER, stop at the Invalides and get the lilac metro to Ecole Militaire. One hour and you are there. I am now trying to plan my second visit to Paris, and I will certainly be staying at the Relais Bosquet again!

The hotel was wonderful to stay at and the staff was marvelous! I asked for a view room, which we were able to get. That was perhaps a lucky break, but very much appreciated. I can't tell you how excited we were to see the Eiffel Tower from our room, especially the first time we saw it twinkle! We about fell out of the window!

The hotel owns three separate apartments, two of which are studios. We stayed at the Studio Valadon, which is right around the corner from Rue Cler and its many amenities and a short 10 minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower. A metro stop is about a block away. The apartment is on the 4th floor of a quiet apartment building built around a courtyard. There is a miniscule, one person elevator to get your luggage up the stairs (or you if you need), and the kids got a kick out of that. Although the apartment is tiny, it was wonderful to be able to have our own little kitchen, computer and to feel like we were true Parisians, buying food at the neighborhood butcher, fruit stalls and corner grocery. We didn't have the service one would have at the hotel itself, but we enjoyed being more autonomous and less touristy. The apartment itself is well-appointed, modern, and true to how it looks on the web. There is no view per se, but the many windows look out onto an inner courtyard and neighboring roofs. The kitchen could be better stocked with cooking utensils and service items, but it was adequate for what we needed. The shower and toilet are in separate rooms, which is handy if you have more than one person staying with you. Somehow they fixed the flat screen television to provide English speaking cable channels for us, and although we didn't watch much TV, it was nice to hear the news on CNN in English. The computer they provided worked so well we rarely opened our laptops. Cleaning service is every three days, but they leave plenty of towels and supplies. Frederica and her team are lovely to work with at the hotel, answered our every question and arranged for a very reasonable van service to take us to and from the airport.

Great loacation, spotlessly clean, fantastic facilities and very friendly and helpfull staff. Without doubt the best value hotel i have ever stayed in especialy considering we recieved free tickets to the Louvre when we booked. Checked in at 12pm no problem at all ( unlike the London hotel we stayed at the night before where we were charged \u00c2\u00a310 extra to check in before 3.30pm). Room was just as the hotel's own website shows and was very pleased when i opened the window to see we had a view of the tower ( room 24). I was going to update our room to superior on arrival but, after seeing our standard room i could see no point in the upgrade even though it is a relatively small charge. Great bathroom with bath and shower, lost of little extras like tissues, flannels,shoe shining kit, sowing kit, shower caps, body lotion and shower gell. Breakfast served in the room was a great idea 10 Euros for the continental delivered to your room at a time of your choosing has to be a bargain. The street is pretty quiet ( as is the whole area ) but with the electric blackout blind down its both silent and dark until you chose to open up in the morning. Hotel is within an easy walk of the Eiffel and the river ( i highly recommend using the Batobus Hop on Hop off service (just down the steps to the river at the back of the tower, bought a 2 day pass for 16 Euros ( 5 day for 19Euros) and used it all day every day) great views so relaxing and saved a fortune in taxis. Bars cafe shops and restaurants all around the hotel and streets nearby so you cant be stuck for somewhere to eat or drink but i would recommend, on a warm evening, pack a picnic with bottle of wine and get off the Batobus at the Jardin des Plantes to enjoy the locals in free music and dancing ( or maybe just watch the dancing like me) its a beautiful way to spend an evening and it will only cost you a few Euros if you shop at one of the supermarkets near the Hotel Relais Bosquet . This was our first visit to Paris and i have to say it was fantastic and cant wait to visit again. The Relais Bosquet will be on my booking list for sure as i cant see how this hotel can be beaten for value.So i would say if you are thinking of booking stop thinking and just DO IT you wont regret this hotel for sure.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat place, great neighborhood.\u201d", "Author": "llgg23", "ReviewID": "UR39113130", "Content": "Great hotel.

It was a hotel oriented to folks who needed to be in town for business reasons (I was in for a conference), yet wanted to be in an excellent neighborhood where leisure and recreational activities were within reach. The one thing that really stood out in my mind was the exceptional service, and the super friendly atmosphere. Being quite busy, I was hard pressed to come up with an itinerary for things to do at night. Lucky for me, my email to the Hotel was received by Mr. Christian, at the concierge desk. He stayed in touch with me online, and made 4 reservations for dinner (at the OK L'affriole, sumptuous Le Florimond, exciting L'Ami Jean, and for the coup de grace: a marvelous dinner cruise on Bateaux Parisiens for our final night). I do not think one will get service like this anywhere else at a hotel at this price point (if you find another place, let me know). Mind you, it wasn't just Mr. Christian -- the other concierge staff were real nice too, and ready to help out (Ms. Frederica comes to mind).

We were very pleased. Our adventure began the minute we looked out our hotel window and saw the Eiffel Tower (Tour Eiffel, en francais). I knew how Dorothy felt when she said, \"We're not in Kansas anymore, Toto.\" We booked our 7-night stay using the hotel's website and received a prompt response confirming our reservation. I emailed the hotel a week before we arrived to get info on day trips, etc, and received prompt responses and assistance setting up all the outings we requested, as well as a transfer from the airport. Our room was just like the pictures on the webite. By US standards the room was small, but we had plenty of room. There was a small dresser and armoire to hang clothing in plus a bench to store our suitcases; one on, one under. The bed was very comfortable and I miss the feather pillows. If you're tall, the bed may be short, but we had no complaints. The room staff kept everything neat and clean, with fresh towels and bathroom accessories daily. Our room, #54, was in the main building right on the street. There is a lot of traffic noise and nightlife, but with the window closed we couldn't hear a thing. We usually left the window open and didn't mind the noise - it was all part of the Paris experience. The few times we had the window closed, we used the a/c which worked wonderfully. There is a breakfast buffet available with a wonderful selection of breads, eggs, cold and warm meats, cheeses, fruit, cereal, yogurt, coffee, juices and the best butter we'd ever tasted. If you have the Rick Steves Paris 2009 book, as we did, breakfast is free (usually 15E per person). The front desk staff were friendly and helpful and very quick to speak English when our French left something to be desired. I do miss the friendly \"bon jour\" and \"bon soir\" we heard from them every day. I still have the urge to say it to strangers, just for the fun of it. The hotel location is wonderful and very safe. We were less than a minute away from two major bus stops and 5 minutes tops to the L'Ecole Militaire metro station. We found ourselves out walking late at night with no concerns for safety. The Rue Cler is about 1 block from the hotel with a wonderful bakery and several great restaurant options and is busy with locals and tourists alike. There is also a bakery next door with delicious baguettes, but I preferred Changement de Direction on the Rue Cler; their pastries were to die for and they gladly boxed several up for us to bring home on the plane. It made leaving Paris slightly less painful. By the time we left, we felt like we were leaving our favorite neighborhood.

The Ecole Militaire metro is a couple of blocks away. The room was decently sized with cheerful colors. It had a flat-screen tv and a fridge.

The small lobby features two computers for your use. Your touch-type speed will be slowed considerably unless you are accustomed to using a French keyboard. We had a few minor issues. The beds were very hard but given all the walking we did in Paris, we had no trouble sleeping. Also, the showerhead was a bit clogged so that the spray was erratic. Rather than have a full-width shower curtain, there was a partial glass door so that unless you were very careful, some shower water ended up on the floor. The breakfast is a little pricey at 15 euros but it is a nicely presented and high quality selection. The unintrusive desk staff was polite and helpful.

We wanted to spend a few days in Paris so I booked 4 days here using Travelocity. Part of the reason I picked this hotel was the recommendation of the Hotel Valadon front desk (# 12 on Trip Advisor) because it was full. Also the price seemed reasonable, $130 Euros for 2 twin beds. The location was great, we walked to the Eiffel Tower, to Musee D'orsay, to the Louvre, Hotel Invalides and really just all over. There are great restaurants everywhere, we walked to Rue St. Dominique for dinner twice. Rue Cler market street is just around the corner and it was awesome. Exactly what you envision Paris will be like. The staff was cordial but not friendly, and not overly helpful. I needed batteries and asked if the store across the street would have any and they told me no. What they didn't tell me was 5 addresses down was a Fran Prix market that had batteries and everything else you might need. When we needed to get to Roland Garros I asked the best method - taxi or metro. They recommended a taxi and called one for us. It cost 15 euros to get there and we could not find one to bring us home. We had to walk to a hotel a mile from Roland Garros and have them call us a taxi. Two days later when we had more tickets we decided to try the metro. The station was close to our hotel and took us straight to the stadium and cost us 1.60 euros each, quite a savings. Again, maybe they thought we were too dumb to figure it out on our own, but I was unhappy with their lack of guidance. Breakfast was adequate but expensive, 15 euros each for croissants, eggs, coffee and a fruit cup. It was advertised as 15 euros per room, but they insisited on charging us 15 each. We took advantage of the boulangerie on the corner and the Fran Prix to get our own breakfast after the first morning. Our view was a narrow courtyard and everyone else's window. That didn't really bother us. The beds however where too small for my 6 foot son and his feet hung over the end. He didn't sleep well while we were there. I guess upgrading to double beds may have been necessary for someone his size. The bathroom was very nice with nice toiletries, the towels were very large, but somewhat rough. They had free wi-fi which was very nice, our previous hotel charged for wi-fi. Bottom line, great location, clean rooms, nice bathroom, pleasant lobby, buy your breakfast elsewhere, don't get the twin beds if you're tall, and don't expect the staff to be overly helpful.

Polite, professional and courteous, the English-speaking staff anticipated and met our every need. They arranged a Yellow Van to meet us at the CDG airport (36E for two) and then reserved a return trip shuttle for our departure as well. They gave easy-to-follow directions for taking buses and metro and literally saved us hundreds of euros for our day trip to Versailles with directions on how to take the right train. The room was very clean with fresh linens and towels every day; the electric room darkening shades were a plus for late afternoon power naps. It was also lovely to have an electric \"hot pot\" for having tea or coffee in the room. Although some travellers may have been put off or inconvenienced by the on-going renovation to the lobby, we left early each day and returned early each evening so experienced very little inconvenience to mention. Nonetheless, the staff offered us an additional discount on our room and the one day we could not use the elevator, provided us with a complimentary bottle of champagne! We were about a 15-minute walk from the Eiffel Tower (which we could partially see from our room #33!) and an equal distance to Des Invalides in the opposite direction. The markets and cafes of Rue Cler were less than a block from our door. Served from 7-11am, the breakfast is quite adequate with eggs, sausage, ham, fruit, juice, coffee/tea, yogurt, breads and cereals. (Ask for the \"Rick Steves discount\" to have this included as a complimentary breakfast ). Go early for a clean tablecloth! For ordering on-line, we also had our choice of a free pair of tickets: the Louvre or Andy Warhol exhibit.

Positives: The room was very clean - the carpets and sheets especially. The bathroom looked updated and everyday it was cleaned very well by housekeeping. This room faced the street and the window had electronic shutters that you could close at night to keep the noise and light out (which were not at all an issue). The hotel is in the Rue Cler district where you can experience true Parisian life - no tourist shops here. This is the best part of the hotel. You can walk around the area and enjoy all the small shops and cafes. You can walk to the Eiffel Tour. Free internet in the lobby. Good value! Staff was very friendly and most spoke English. Negatives: In this room the toilet was in a seperate area than the shower and sink and that small room had no fan or window. There was a constant moldy smell there.

The costs of the room compared well with Paris hotels generally, especially the reduced rate for 3 days. Tea and coffee facilities are provided, which is often not the case in Paris. Decent size bath towels too! Minor quibbles were the fact that free internet was provided, but that the signal was very weak in the room we had.

The electric blinds and quiet neighborhood made sleeping very conducive, which was quite helpful. We felt it was a bargain, especially for the size of the room and bathroom facilities, at 205E a night. The Rue Cler neighborhood in which Relais Bosquet is located was perfect. It is walkable to many places (stores, outdoor markets, bistros, boulangeries, patisseries) and also situated near 3 metro stops and 2 bus lines, all which helped us to see as much of Paris as we could in the most efficient manner. It is a perfect location to see the traditional tourist sights of Paris, while providing a quiet nieghborhood at the end of the day to return to and have a glass of wine while watching Parisians on their way home from work stopping at Rue Cler's many outdoor markets.

It is a pity that all the outdoor eating is really off limits if you aren't a smoker. The hotel itself is somewhat tired in the public areas and there are plans to redo it sometime in the future. I was initially put off by the amount of dust on the carpet in the halls and am surprised it hasn't been noted in any review.

It was a good size with lots of storage, two large windows in the bedroom and one in the bathroom and very quiet in terms of noise from the outside. While smoking is permitted there was no hint of smoke.The windows were always left open by the cleaning staff and the room felt fresh and airy. The bathroom had a big tub and shower which was great and double sinks with lots of counter space and there was always hot water. It is also great if you have to rinse out clothes and hang them up since there are racks that work really well. The one drawback was the toilet which was in a separate room but it was across the room from the bathroom and felt very closed in. It was beside the bed and the sound of flushing from other rooms could be heard. The breakfast was ample and the staff serving it excellent. Christian and the other men at the front desk were all pleasant and very helpful. While I have noted some issues with the hotel I would still recommend it highly.

Great for having wine and cheese in the room. I can't say enough about the location (two blocks from Ecole Militare metro stop and in the middle of the 7th Arr. near the Eiffel Tower), the shops in the area, the staff (most pleasant I've encountered on my many trips to Paris) and the room itself. The restaurant across the street (Le Bosquet) is great food and well priced, also friendly staff there! Book it now, availability goes fast as people are discovering this place at a rapid rate.

We have four children so finding an adequate place to stay for 4 nights in a good location is not easy without spending a fortune. We stayed in two superior rooms with an extra bed in each one. The rooms were a nice size with a hallway and a closet to store things such as suitcases out of the way. The rooms had a mini bar which could also fit in a few things that you had purchased at the grocery. They also had free wi fi in the rooms which was so easy to use. Even the Hilton is paris charges over $30 for wi fi for one night. This came in very handy as my wallet was pickpocketed from my zipped purse when we arrived on our first metro ride. My advice for ladies is not to be dumb like me and leave that purse it home. We are Rick STeve's readers so we requested the free breakfast. Rick Steves has advice for paris that more than pays for his book. This hotel was part of that. Free breakfast for a family of 6 is worth about $75 US a day. The location was excellent. There was a grocery called Franix (I believe) within steps of the hotel so we could stock up on food for our back pack to eat while we were out. Eating at sit down anything is hard for a family so this was great for us. The wine selection there was great and very inexpensive. The personnel at the hotel especially Christian was wonderful. They helped in any way that they possibly good to offer advice, and point you to the right metro. Another wonderful addition to this hotel was that they had a great ice machine in the lobby. We did not find this any where else on our trip. I am sure it was added esp for all of the ice hungry americans that come to this hotel. The neighborhood around this area was very safe and quiet.

We recommend buying a \"carnet\" or book of 10 tickets good for Metro or RER. The hotel itself had internet access in the lobby and a cordial front desk staff. We opted to decline the 13E \"petit dejuener\" and stopped next door at the boulangerie for fresh bread, croissants and other bakery goodies for a fraction of the cost. They also had coffee to go which is unusual in Paris. The room itself is small, but had a decent bathroom, a safe and a complementary tray for coffee or tea. We also liked the metal shades on the windows that block out both light and sound. Our room faced the courtyard vs. the street, so it was already very quiet. All in all, we recommend the Hotel Relais Bosquet.", "Date": "April 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheddar, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIt's not in the top ten for nothing!\u201d", "Author": "Busmantoo", "ReviewID": "UR15298979", "Content": "Maybe there's no such thing as the perfect hotel in Paris, due to price, demand and so on - but this little gem gets pretty close.

The hotel didn't disappoint-- it was the best hotel we stayed at during our European vacation. The hotel is very reasonably priced for European standards. The good: Location, location, location! It's within a 10-15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower, less than 5 minute walk to the Metro, and a block away from a street that features a permanent farmer's market. Since I love food, it was perfect for me (I still dream about the warm buttery chocolate croissants from the corner cafe... *drools). The staff are friendly and extremely knowledgeable. Right after I booked the hotel online, I received a confirmation email from the hotel staff asking me if I needed them to help with any ground transportation. Also, when we checked in, they remembered that it was an anniversary trip and wished us a happy anniversary! Rooms are bright, cozy, and clean. Unlike soom other hotels we stayed at during our trip, it always looked forward to coming back to our hotel room, and we were sad to leave. The electronic shutters were good at keeping out the light. Free wireless internet. We are from Silicon Valley and love our technology. Free internet is always good. The bad: Beds are hard. Then again, none of the beds in any of the hotels we stayed at in Europe were soft. Breakfast is not included (and it's pricey). Skip breakfast at the hotel and go to the corner cafe to get a chocolate croissant (see above... yum). Our room had no view at all. It's ok though, since they gave us a bigger room to make up for the lack of a view. Walls are thin-- we were next to an elevator and could hear everytime people were using it. It didn't bother my husband, but I could've done without it. Overall, we loved our stay here and wish we were able to stay longer.

I arrived at the hotel, (ahead of my other half travelling from Edinburgh), at approximately 8:00am after a flight from the United States. I was grateful for the effort made by the staff to get me into our room very early. Cab fare from Charles De Gaulle during morning rush hour was approximately \u00c2\u00a335. Room #45 is a standard room and for the most part it resembled the photo on the hotel's website. It was snug but not as small as some of the European rooms I've stayed in; we had no problem stashing our luggage out of the way. The view of the Eiffel Tower and the Rue du Champs de Mars, decorated for Christmas, was picture postcard pretty. The window was outfitted with an electric shutter which came in handy when we wanted to block out the noise from the street below. The room contained two small twin beds pushed together, a wooden wardrobe which stored an iron and ironing board and extra blankets, a small desk and chair, a mini bar with plenty of space to store our own water and snacks, and a working safe. Everything was clean and well presented. The bathroom was small but equipped with a full bath/shower and the standard ameneties. The towels were large and decent quality and there was plenty of hot water and good water pressure at all times. One of the nicer things on offer is the use of the free internet access in the lobby. If you've never pecked out an e-mail on a French keyboard, (I hadn't), prepare to be amused. The hotel sits in a charming neighborhood with a range of good cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. The Cafe Champs de Mars, just doors down from the hotel, was the perfect spot for a late meal after a night of pub crawling in Le Marais. The metro station and post office are within easy walking distance. The hotel staff both at reception and housekeeping are accomodating, friendly and professional. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel so I can't comment on the food service. We enjoyed so many things about this wonderful little hotel but we did have one rather significant problem...we found the beds to be extremely uncomfortable. We loved the location, the price, the staff, the view, so many things...but we didn't sleep well. At the end of the day a good night's rest is the most important aspect of any hotel.

Frederique, one of the clerks at the front desk, is incredibly friendly and helpful. Don't hesitate to ask her for help with getting a taxi, etc...

The hotel can arrange for this pass to be delivered to the hotel and waiting for you when you arrive, and it will allow you to by-pass lines that can sometimes be fairly lengthy.

The Relais Bosquet is a great little boutique hotel...quite modest, but very charming. It is clean, and offers several amenities you would expect in a larger operation. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful (even in translating a french website on the lobby computer). The reservation was very easy and everything was just as presented on their website. We did not eat at the hotel so I can not comment on this. I wholly recommend a stay at the Relais Bosquet if you are visiting Paris...you won't be disappointed. We will definitely consider this hotel our own little home when returning!", "Date": "August 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgreat stay\u201d", "Author": "rubeus", "ReviewID": "UR8427798", "Content": "We stayed in the apartment for 3 nights.

We got to the hotel by Yellow Van which was arranged for us through the Hotel. This worked very well and made the transfer easy. You could have got here by a combination of the Roissy bus and Metro 8 but it would have involved hauling bags up and down quite a number of stairs. All in all, the van worked well and was not expensive. The front desk staff were extraordinarily helpful and pleasant. They speak excellent English and are happy to help you with suggestions, reservations and advice on request. Check in and out was efficient with no surprises. The front lobby has a computer to access the internet. It has a different keyboard than the one that we use in Canada but, with some considerable patience, you can get used to it. It is often used by guests but is generally available with a short wait. The hotel has wireless internet and so bringing a lap top would be a good idea. Ice is obtained through the front desk and isn't available on each floor which was fine as far as we were concerned. We had a superior room which was very nice. Had to insert the room \"key\" into a slot by the door to make the lights work, which was a new one for us and not something that came to us immediately. It had a large bathroom with two sinks and a large and effective shower. A separate WC was within the room. The air conditioning worked well, thank goodness! The safe was inside the small fridge (which wasn't the first place that we looked for it). The fridge has enough room to store soda, cheese, meat, and other stuff if you wish. They do stock it with the usual which we didn't use. They have a coffee maker in the room that we didn't use. There was a small TV which had 3 English channels plus a number of other channels. There was a large cabinet and a chest of drawers for clothes which was adequate. Electronically closing blinds completely darken the room and completely keep out outside noise. One could hear the doors open and close in adjacent hotel rooms. Breakfast was included in our package and was very good. It consisted of orange juice and \"cake\" to start, followed by coffee and heated milk, chocoate bread (addictive), croissants (very good) and additional bread with an assortment of jams and butter. Cheese came with it as did some cut up melon. This was one filling breakfast that was very good. We never were able to eat all of it and it pretty much filled you up until supper time cutting the costs of lunch (generally you might just need a drink and could share a salad and that would do you the rest of the day). I am sure that you could go out to a local bakery etc and it would be fine, but this was so convenient and so good! The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the Eiffel tower and two blocks from the Metro. It is one block from Rue Cler. There are two bakeries nearby and two grocery stores as well. Banking was within two blocks. I highly suggest the Le Bosquet restaurant nearby as it has great service and food. Cafe du March is also close and is a little cheaper with reasonable food and a fun atmosphere. You can get a crepe on Rue Cler that is the equivalent of a full meal. Wine shops abound nearby.

It was right around the corner from a Metro stop, which took us to most everywhere in the city very easily. We ate at 3 different restaurants nearby the hotel.

You have an ATM across the street and a small grocery a few doors down. If you stay long enough to need clean clothes, you don't have far to walk to a clean laundromat.

The hotel is a few minutes walk from the Ecole Militaire metro (line 8) and bus #69 stops nearby (great route - Invalides, Musee D'Orsay, Louvre, near Notre Dame and Marais) and a few mintues from bus stop #92 (Arch de Triomphe and Gare Montparnasse (we went to the latter to catch a train for Chartres).

Unfortunately, we didn't get much use of the patio due to the weather condition in November. The size was more than adequate and amenities were better than expected with the DVD and CD players. We didn't stay in one of the hotel rooms and therefore unable to comment on the quality of the room. My impression from the lobby was that the d\u00c3\u00a9cor was a little outdated and didn't look well maintained. I did like the fact that there's a PC/internet available for guest use. The location of the apt/hotel was excellent; just one block away from the Tour Eiffel. The neighborhood is mainly residential, quiet and upscale. I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking to stay at a place that's busy and happening. Most of the shops close early in this area. The front desk staff offered adequate service for a 3-star hotel. With that said, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to command the hotel staff on their professional and courteous way of handling problems. We encountered a problem with the apt lock upon check-out. One of the keys was stuck in the lock and we were unable to open the door. The hotel manager and staff calmly helped us check out and allowed us to leave for airport. We were told that the deposit would probably have to be forfeited if the hotel incurred costs in fixing the situation. I was not optimistic that I would be able to get much of the deposit back. However, the hotel emailed me after a couple days and let me know the cost was 30 euros. I was relieved to learn that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a costly problem and the hotel staff handled it promptly and kept us informed. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d go for a hotel if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your first time in Paris and prefer to join tours and visit the city in a well-planned out way. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend the apartment to experienced travelers who are adventurous and willing to find their ways around Paris. Staying at the apt is a bit more costly than staying at a hotel but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all worth it.

We had booked a standard room on the 5th floor on the street side (all the superior rooms were booked) and it was pretty good size (by european standards) for the two of us. I asked for an upper floor and a view of the eiffel tower and they did not disappoint me. What a fantastic view each evening to see it lit up (or twinkling on the hour) outside your window when you return to your room!!! I ducked my head into a room that was a 'superior' and I would recommend spending the extra $$ for the extra room it provided. Yes, I will admit, this does not look like a new hotel as based on the furnishings. And, yes, I think I saw a bath towel that was frayed a bit. But I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Everyone who worked there was more than friendly at all times. They answered all our questions with a smile. And opened our wine bottle when we realized the cork was REALLY stuck in there!! Who can ask for more? And they recommended a REALLY great restaurant on the next street over \"La Litote\" on Rue Bosquet which is a definite MUST for anyone staying in the 7th! The rooms are nicely decorated (bright yellow in our room) and it is really clean (which is a big issue for me). Although halfway through the week we must have had a change in the cleaning woman and we could tell as it wasn't cleaned as well. But still more than sufficient. Breakfast is free if you mention Rick Steves. Hey, I though you get a good deal for what you got---and hey, its free!! If you want more variety for breakfast, yes, Rue Cler is around the corner but I was happy with my croissant and coffee. (you get more than that) The roll down shades are great!

The Hotel is only a couple of blocks from the Metro -- best way to travel in Paris. Best of all, the rooms are air conditioned with individual controls!!!!!!! Definitely a plus when the weather in Europe has been so odd the past couple of years. I was concerned when we saw our room because it was next to the elevator. No worries. Couldn't hear a thing (I made my husband test it before I unpacked). Windows had, best I can describe, hurricane shutters that you could electronically lower if you liked.

I needn't have worried! The room, while cozy, was plenty large enough for the two of us and our two big suitcases (+ carry on backpack and shoulder bag). We didn't feel like we were stepping all over each other, or our luggage. The room had an armoire where we could hang some of our clothes, iron and ironing board, those wonderful electric darkness blinds, and a very functional bathroom with hairdryer and nice toiletries. Oh, and there was also a safe and mini-fridge. You could buy items from the mini-bar, but it also came in handy for us to store our own sodas/water. Just walk a few steps to the right of the hotel's front door, to the grocery store there, and buy Coke or Evian for something like 2.50-3.00 Euros for a 6 pack of either. The front desk staff was always warm and helpful, and housekeeping was excellent. I do recommend that you tip the housekeeper each day - it's apparently the norm in Europe, and you'll get much better service if you do it each day instead of waiting until the end of your stay. I generally left 2-3 Euros a night, and in return, got extra toiletries and towels, a spotlessly clean room, AND I wasn't charged for the 2 drinks we actually did take from the mini-bar before realizing we could just walk to the grocery store. We really enjoyed using the free internet on the computer in the breakfast room. I was able to check in with friends and family, and also get info about some of the tourist sites we wanted to visit later in our trip. The carpet and furniture in the lobby and in the halls is slightly worn, but we didn't mind at all. For the price and location, this hotel is a GEM. As for location, you couldn't ask for better. We spent some time in the Latin Quarter at night, and it was bustling and noisy even late at night. We really loved coming \"home\" to our little section of Paris, where it was peaceful and not as crowded. At the same time, it was soooo easy to get from our location in the 7th to anywhere else in Paris. For one, Paris is incredibly walk-able. Second, the Ecole Militaire metro stop is an easy 3 minutes or so away. I was a bit intimidated to try using the metro on our first day, but it really was easy, and we ended up using it multiple times a day, zipping all over Paris with ease. Finally, the location can't be beat for restaurants. The 7th is full of lovely little bistros that are moderately priced (23-30 Euros per person for a delicious multi-course prix fixe meal).

We had reserved a room for four nights at a nearby hotel that turned out to be nothing like what was represented on the hotel's website on in \"France for Dummies\". We called back to the US and had my husband check TripAdvisor for some other hotels in the same neighborhood. With three hotel names in hand, we wandered out in the rain and happily found the Hotel Relais-Bosquet just two blocks away. We walked into the lobby, looking quite soggy and miserable, and inquired if they had a room available. The man at the front desk was so kind and polite when we explained that we had a reservation at another hotel but the room was unsatisfactory. He said he had a room we could have for two nights but then we would have to change to a different room. We were more than happy to change rooms since we did not have a reservation. The desk clerk then asked us if we would like to see the room. It was lovely -- spacious, clean and beautifully decorated. We immediately went back to the other hotel, checked out and returned to the Relais-Bosquet with our luggage. As soon as we walked up to the desk, the clerk told us that he had found a room that we could have for all four nights. We checked in and went to the room. While it was a bit smaller than the first room, it was still very comfortable and spacious. The bathroom was very spacious as well and spotlessly clean. We had drawer space, armoire space and lots of shelf space in the bathroom. After getting settled in our room, we went to the lobby to check our e-mail since we hadn't been near a computer in a week. We asked the desk clerk if he could recommend a restaurant for dinner. He told us that many places were closed on Sunday and especially this particularly Sunday because Monday was May 1, a national holiday. He said, \"Let me see if I can get a reservation for you.\" He called several places and did arrange reservations for dinner at a very nice, reasonably priced restaurant about 10 mins. away. This was the beginning of a beautiful friendship between us and the people at the front desk. Every single one of them was so polite and helpful. They made reservations for us for all types of things and kept us apprised of when the museums were open, the best times to visit different sites, etc. We enjoyed the breakfast every morning we were there. The breakfast room is very light and airy and the service by Christian was impeccable.

One was a segway tour of the city which lasted about four hours. We were treated like celebrities and asked to stop for pictures all along the way. The other great tour was a bike tour to Versailles - you bike from the office near the Eiffel Tower to a nearby train station, train to Versailles, stop at a market to pick up items for a picnic and bike around Versailles - definitely the best way to see its 800 acres.

The hotel was 150 euros/night (about $180 US) and did not include breakfast. We were very pleased with the hotel overall and will stay here when we return and will also recommend to friends. Here's a rundown ... \"Spacious\" (by Europe's standards) modern bathrooms with plush towels and wash clothes - a rare luxury in Europe; spotless rooms that were well-maintained and cleaned daily; professional, helpful English-speaking staff; terrific location (right next to Rue Cler, which is the pedestrian-friendly food market, so delicious food is a stone's throw away); best boulangerie in Paris for breakfast and for patisseries (located on the corner across from delicious Cafe du Marche, which serves excellent Parisian cafe fare for reasonable prices); hotel is located a short 5-minute walk to the Eiffel Tower; free Internet access in the lobby; quiet neighborhood (request a room facing the courtyard for maximum quiet); black-out blinds, which would be helpful during the summer months. The hotel charges 6.5 euros/person additional for a standard, uninspiring continental breakfast, which is served in their lobby. I would recommend forgoing this expense and instead visiting the boulangerie for delicious breads and pastries and then walking 5 more steps to Cafe du Marche to sit and enjoy your breakfast and order coffee, juices, etc. at the cafe. Although the room was a bit expensive, we were happy with the extra amenities Hotel Relais Bosquet affords. Many US travelers might find the size of the rooms very small by US standards, but these rooms are fairly large by Europe standards and the bathrooms are especially large and modern. If you want to stay in this perfect Paris neighborhood but are on budget, try Champ du Mars, which is located 2 doors down from Relais Bosquet.

The other guests all seemed to be American with only a few exceptions. The guests also all seemed to be in their mid-50s to 60s. I didn't see any other young people (<35) at the hotel. The pastry shop on the corner makes the perfect breakfast stop (1-2E per pastry). So we never tried the breakfast at the hotel. There are about 6 restaurants within at 2 block radius, if not more. We tried a few and none of them were bad but none were fabulous. We enjoyed La Terrace near the metro the most. Location near many metro stops, RER, Eiffel Tower, Seine, and Invalides was great.
