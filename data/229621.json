These rooms are newly remodeled and if your standing on the patio they have a view of the arc. It was amazing.( I do believe they have direct view rooms as well). I do wish they had chairs on the patio... But they may have been a bit to narrow for that. The hotel location is great. Your right in the middle of it all - it is quite busy everywhere you go. (but thats Paris) The staff at the Splendid Etoille was super friendly. The rooms themselves were very big for Paris standards. Plenty of room. Even with all the luggage and clutter that comes with a 5 night stay. The rooms even have a small sitting area which we used often for our daily ritual of ordering coffee for 2 from room service. Highly reccomended! The bathrooms are anazing! My fsvorite! All completely updated and sparkling clean! Definately take a bath if your their in the colder months like we were :). The only thing I have to say that's remotely negative is that the beds were not as soft and plush as I would have liked... Or am accustomed to from nicer hotels in the States. I will say though, we visited 3 different locations in Europe for our honeymoon - all nicer hotels - and this was consistant across the board... Could just be a difference in culture? Either way, i would highly reccomend this hotel. You can walk to do many if the sites and your right next to the hop-on hop-off bus stop and the river cruises. The Eiffel tower is not that bad of a walk either if your up to it ... 20 minutes tops. If you stay here, be sure to visit drugstore republics right on the Champs. Honestly, it's the coolest store. One night we got amazing food from there...the grocery, wine and dessert sections and brought it back to the room for a carpet picnic. Highly reccomended.

Room was very well furnished, curtains, bedding etc 1st class and bathroom fittings all top of the range and spotless. Hotel concierge and all staff always very helpful. Metro within 50 yards. Negatives - no social feel to hotel, little public area, bar always empty, restaurant down narrow corridor. By my standards very expensive, we booked thro Expedia for a \"romantic break\" which included room upgrade plus bottle of champagne, cost \u00c2\u00a3500 for 2 nights room only. Breakfast another \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 per head. No tea making facility in room, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6 for tea/coffee room service (but it came beautifully presented with biscuits).

It was a regular room for two people. Before making a reservation for Splendid, I looked into and read reviews of 100+ hotels in Paris - and all of them had tiny rooms, barely larger than the bed (which is tiny as well :) However, the room I stayed in Splendid Etoile was reasonably large. The sleeping room itself was smaller than average European rooms, but there were lots of other space inside the room where you could put your baggage or other things. The bathroom was also spacious with a full sized bath. I cannot comment on the food of the hotel, because I have not had any. The most important and best aspect of this hotel was its location. It is 20-30 meters from Arc de Triomphe, which means it is also that much close to the beginning of the Champs Elysee street. This trip was my first one in 12 years to Paris, and I did not remember the city at all, so while selecting the hotel I was concentrated on selecting one with a good location. After spending 7 nights, I am happy I chose this hotel. The Metro station is right in front of the hotel. Also, the Air France buses that go to the airport also leave on the street across from the Hotel. You can use these buses to go to the airport even if you are not an Air France passenger. It is reasonable priced (I dont remember the price, however it was maybe 1/5th of a taxi ride).

We had what I assume was the best view, room 507 with the wrap around corner balcony. The room is a touch small, but beautifully decorated and the view definitely outweighs room size. This room is ideal for couples, there is no additional room for cribs, etc. There are 2 sets of doors for each window opening, insuring that outside noise and traffic will not be an issue. The bathroom is modern, beautiful, and clean. The staff were courteous, helpful, and spoke English. It is conveniently located, as others have said, with a taxi stand across the street and the Metro/RER across the street. We did not try the hotel restaurant. Some have commented that they did not like the fact that you left your room key with the front desk when not occupying the room. I did not have a problem with this and actually appreciated that I did not have to keep up with a room key. From a safety standpoint/ anti-theft standpoint, I felt that the staff was trustworthy and reputable, so this did not bother me.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "mark b", "ReviewID": "UR119055387", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Splendid Etoile in early October.

I just returned from a 2 night stay (for business) at this hotel. (As it turns out I also stayed here on my first trip to Paris as a tourist in 1993.) I found the hotel very comfortable and if you are looking for a relaxing but simple start to your vacation of a weekend city break then this might be a great option for you too. Here are the details The location of this hotel was the primary choice and for those that are unfamiliar with the large city (or like me) were looking to enjoy the odd hour away from work, then this hotel can hardly be bettered. Just next to the Arc de Triomphe and at the top/north-west end of the Champs-\u00c3\u2030lys\u00c3\u00a9es the hotel has great access to several sights, shops, restaurants, bars and entertainment areas. But as Paris covers a large area and has many distinct neighborhoods, the hotel also benefits from being on a Metro/RER line that connects you to every corner of the city. Note that in good weather the city bikes are also a good alternative with parking stations just round the corner. If arriving to the hotel by car or taxi be warned that due to its location you may need to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgo around the block\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in order to be dropped off on the right side of the road. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d prefer to avoid this \u00e2\u20ac\u201c give a taxi driver the cross streets and just cross the road. As far as facilities go this hotel is quite slim on options. The lobby is small and can get crowded if busy. Next to this is a small bar area with complimentary newspapers in several languages. The bar itself was not used but was small, dark and clearly not used by anyone other than guests waiting for people. Given the location this is not an issue but if you like to get your money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth out of each star of this hotel then you might be disappointed. The restaurant was only used for breakfast. At this time of day only half the space is used, with only a couple of staff meaning that when full it can get slow and hectic. Nevertheless the breakfast was well appointed with a small hot selection but large cold selection of cheeses, cold meats, excellent fruit, cereals, breads, jams, yogurts and so on. The staff for pleasant and helpful at all times. The breakfast team seemed to only speak French and can get busy when full which while OK for me might bother others. The rooms are mostly a good size with all the modern features. It seems some renovations are going on to upgrade some of the more dated furnishings but even in the older furnished rooms the bed was comfortable. With only 6 floors and 10 rooms per floor there is some variety in the offering of rooms. Rooms ending in 8 (e.g. 408) seem to have a good view of the Arc de Triomphe which for a romantic couple might add that magic extra. I had #xx1 which while at the back of the building (no view) had a lot of space and would be very suitable for a family looking to share one room. Be aware that many of the double beds are two singles put together so if this will be an issue ask at reception and ensure when you book that you specify that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a couple staying. Bathroom was modern and clean. Ultimately you get value for money because of its location but as a small hotel its never going to drop its price and you will find little else in the area better.

Strangely room '10' on each floor was missing! However replaced by room '11' - eg 511 [on floor 5]. Warning about these rooms - they back on to the lifts and you get an early morning call from the mechanisms when the first person in the hotel gets up! The rooms themselves were impeccably clean, kept up by an half an hour cleaning routine during which a room maid will keep you out. Our room decor was brown and dated, however we did catch glimpse of other airier and brighter rooms. They have a well stocked mini-bar and a tv. Breakfast has a good range of cereals, meat, cheese, fruits, bread etc. However the breakfast room itself only has 20 seats - [8 x 2 seater and 2 x 4 seaters], so once 10 rooms are down [estimating 60 in hotel] you can wait up to half an hour in the lounge area for a table to become free! 9 o'clock was the busiest time we found. Due to the lack of space and volume of turn over the staff dealing with these limitations often plummet into chaos. For example - lack of spoons, no tea or coffee unless you asked for it and so on. Ability to speak french also a necessity when conversing with breakfast staff [and rightly so as it is France]. Strangely even though we had arrived at the beginning of August the bar and restaurant we closed. We were never informed of this when we booked.

The Metro was easy to navigate and most of the tellers knew some English if you needed help. I would not recommend wasting money on the Moulin Rouge show. Everything else we did was wonderful. Notre Dame Cathedral took my breath away. Just an FYI- Watch out for the gypsies. We had 6 different people trying to sell us the same gold band. They will ask you to read a card if you speak English, which asks for money. They will walk up to you and drop a ring on the ground and pick it up to offer it to you. They are not aggressive, but this was annoying after awhile. I would recommend seeing the Eiffell Tower in the evening, and the lights are amazing at the beginning of the hour.

The small, inside rooms are fine if youre just staying for a couple of days and you need a quiet place to sleep in a clean room. But no, there's no view of anything but the next building. And being an old building, the maintenence folks are busy all day. In old hotels, whether Paris, New York, or London, you never know what you're going to get for a problem. My impression is that this Hotel does their best to address them. Taxis. This hotel is right in front of a busy taxi stand. Walk out the front door and take the cab at the front of the line. Calling a cab is unneccessary. Even during the general strike in France, there were cabs available. Carnot Street at the Arc is a major Paris hub for bus and cab, as well as an RER and metro stop. If you get the concierge to call a cab, know that Paris taxis, like most large cities, charge from the moment they start out to pick you up, not from door to door. So, the meter is running from the time the phone gets put down, not from the time the cab shows at the hotel. That's standard, and it can make a 6 euro trip cost 20. If theis is what you want, than be prepared to pay for it. Phone calls. I made a few short long distant calls (direct dialed), and was pleasantly surprised by the cost (total was 5 - 6 euros.) The staff were courteous and professional. The area is excellent. I had no problems. if you plan to spend any time in your room other than sleeping and showering, pay more for a bigger room.

Let me start with the Hotel Splendid Etoile. This was the perfect location, especially if arriving at CDG airport. I was slightly worried about how we would get into central Paris and find the hotel. I didn't want to pay a very costly transfer but I need not have worried. We flew with Air France and on their site I stumbled across their airport coach service. We got an Air France coach (Line 2) right outside the Terminal for 12 euros return and 30 mins later, after one previous stop, it stopped right across the road from the hotel! The hotel also had a metro and RER stop literally outside the front door - via a lift to the underground station - CDG Etoile. The hotel has charming & clean rooms with a traditional French feel and well equipped - mini bar, safe, bath robe etc. Tea & coffee would have been nice but I appreciate that this is not normally a feature of many European cities. An iron would be helpful for longer than 5 day stays but it wasn't a problem for us. Breakfast was an excellent buffet with a good variety. Staff throughout the hotel were friendly and pleasant. Farooq, the concierge was especially helpful and gave us excellent directions to Palace De Versailles. There was free internet just off the lobby where we could check e-mails and check-in online for our trip home. The hotel was steps from the L'arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysees and there we caught the open top bus tour. We paid for a 2-day ticket and with 4 routes it was a great way to see the City. But beware \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is a free for all when the bus stops. The pushing and shoving to try to get on was terrible. We have been on the tour buses in New York and Barcelona and they were well organised \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but this phew!! Most of the culprits we experienced were French; maybe they have a thing against tourists. We were told that to eat on the Champs Elysees was expensive but we found a very nice eatery that we would recommend. The Bistro Romain offers a two-course meal for 15 euros or three courses for 20 euros with a beer or glass of wine for only 2 euros extra. This was great value as the food was excellent and right on the Champs Elysees in the shadow of the Arc.. If you are nervous watch out for the pigeons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they were on the top of the canvas looking for scraps and flew down even onto empty tables. On our second time there we asked to be moved inside because a child was throwing scraps and they were everywhere!! At the end of our trip it was reassuring to just walk across the road and catch the bus back to the airport \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no hassle. A very pleasant trip and an excellent hotel.

Room was very clean and furniture might be a bit dated but very well maintained. Had a chandelier even. Felt like staying at someone's house guest room. The view from our 5th floor balcony is like looking at a live Paris poster. We must have taken 100 pictures with my DSLR. The staff is very frriendly. Only thing is that our room did not have a clock.Odd.... we overslept and almost misses our airport shuttle. WIFI worked great, and free. Room Bar charges are reasonable. The star rating for hotels seems to be a bit different from the US hotels, so dont expect too much . Also, contrary to the common perception, it looked like most parissiens knew english well and were all willing to speak, as long as you are not an ugly american, loud and proud, you know who. Over all, very happy with our choice.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cwould definitely stay there again!\u201d", "Author": "LondonScout", "ReviewID": "UR60711484", "Content": "An excellent hotel in a great location.

If breakfast isn't included in your rate, go to the cafe across the street which has a continental breakfast for 1/3 the price, or a full one for 1/2.) The superior rooms were very large for Paris - the standards looked small per the fire escape maps in the hallway. Bathrooms were modern (tilt the glass shower wall a bit into the tub to avoid water all over the floor), but the room looked a bit tired. We were on the first floor and could only see the Arc by leaning way out the balcony. The hotel's website has good photos, but make it look a bit more spiffy than it really is. Others have said the windows are soundproofed, but they are not. There are just two set of French door style windows which do block out a lot of the sound, but on the first floor, the cars could easily be heard. It's far enough from the Arc that you don't hear cars from there, just on the streeet, and August traffic wasn't bad. Noise from adjascent rooms is easily heard - we couldn't sleep two nights due to a Nigerian party of some sort in the rooms above us. We complained to the front desk to no avail; other than that, they were helpful. There's a free computer in a booth off the lobby for internet access, but the French keyboard is a bit of a pain. The location is great with the metro/RER stop right out your door, as well as Air France coach buses to CDG or Orly. The RER is cheaper and faster to CDG though for sure and the connection at Chatelet - Les Halles is easy - just cross the platform. So unless you have a lot of luggage, I'd suggest the RER. If you do take the bus, buy a round trip ticket to say about 6 Euros/person.

It could not have been more conveniently located for our 3 night stay in Paris. We took the Air France shuttle bus from Charles De Gaulle airport, which dropped us off right outside the hotel, for 15 euros per person. We could have taken the same shuttle bus back to the airport when we left, and booked it at the front desk, had I known this was available. There is a metro stop right outside the front door of the hotel, so each morning it was very easy to travel to whatever part of the city we planned to visit that day. A bit confusing on the way back if you don't pay attention, because if you exit the metro in the wrong place you can end up far away from the hotel and it can be quite a walk around the Arc to get back. But we finally figured it out after the first day. As other travelers indicated, the view off the balcony was spectacular, and totally made the trip: the Arc d'Triomphe is right there! The metro runs very consistently, so you are able to get anywhere in a matter of minutes: you could even visit Versailles on the metro. Just be sure to buy the Visite Pass which includes Zones 1-6, not just 1-4. The front desk staff was very helpful, despite our broken French, and helped with booking restaurant reservations. The room, though small, had wonderful full length windows that opened onto the balcony; when closed they totally soundproofed the room. We had a triple; 3 twin beds all pushed together in the center of the room. The beds were small for my husband and 23 year old son, and rather firm (I had bruises!) but you are so tired from walking all day it doesn't matter. The shower, as we learned later in the trip, was very good: a handheld system but anchored to the wall above your head, with a full shower curtain. Most of the other hotels we stayed at in France had the low-set handheld unit and no curtain, which made showers a challenge...lots of water on the floor. Good water temperature and pressure. There is a fridge in the room, which is nice if you need to keep anything cold. Overall we were very pleased with our choice. FYI: If you plan to visit the Catacombs, as we tried to do on our last full day, note that although they state they are open until 5 pm, they stop selling tickets at 4 pm. Even if you are in line before that time, they will not let you in after 4 pm. There were about 24 of us in line at 3:45, thinking that if we were in line by that time we would be OK. But the men working turned us all away at 4:00 sharp. So be sure to get there early, because you will be disappointed if you don't.

First, its location is incredibly convenient . . . the Air France bus from CDG drops off right across the street and the RER/Metro station is a few steps from the front door. In addition, I was easily able to walk to the Arc, the Champs-Elysees, the Bateaux-Mouches on the Seine and the Eiffel Tour. You can also catch the les Cars Rouge minutes away on the Champs-Elysees near the Arc. I was very fortunate to get a corner room, so I had a magnificent postcard-like view of the Arc de Triomphe through my floor to ceiling windows which I left open during my waking hours while in the room. Day and night, it was mesmerizing. I appreciated the intimate lobby. My room was lovely and spotless. The staff was very attentive and the concierges were all so helpful! The perfect ending to my magical trip happened my last afternoon there. After returning to my room and throwing open my windows to breathe in a little more of Paris, I was treated to a sun shower immediately followed by a huge double rainbow out my window over the Arc.

I'm being generous by giving the hotel at 4 rating, but 3 wouldn't give it justice either. I guess I expect a lot, seeing as it is my vacation. Our room, an upgraded twin double, had the largest room of any we stayed at during our month-long excursion to Europe. If you are looking for a good tourist hotel where you want something predictable but good, I'd stay here, but there are better options for my tastes. The guy who greeted us was extremely friendly--he's the one previously mentioned by others. We were able to book the hotel at the last minute, which made me worry just a little bit. While I couldn't really find fault with the accommodations or the hotel (yes, the bathroom needed a little updating, and the bedding was only average), I felt that something was missing. As this was my fourth visit to Paris, I have something with which to compare this visit. First of the all, the location is not my favourite; although it's right next to a Metro stop, the place is away from the action so you can't just stroll to anyplace except chain stores and tourist restaurants. You're likely to see a lot of people from your own country, if you know what I mean, which might not bother you. I much preferred staying in the St. Germain area where we stayed at Hotel de Buci one night before renting an apartment in the area. It's much more interesting. Second, the hotel obviously catered to North American tourists so much that it lacked a certain Parisian flair I was expecting. It was a little too predictable for my tastes. On the plus side, the service was attentive, courteous, and made us feel welcome, the room was huge and very clean, and the view when you leaned to the side of the balcony was great. On the down side, the location was a little boring, the decor was a bit tired, the price was expensive for the experience. If you are planning to stay for a week, which you really should plan for, consider renting an apartment in the St. Germain area. Don't we all want to pretend that we live there? This way you can shop for your own breakfast, have a nap in the afternoon if you want, and buy your own flowers for your table.

The areas around the hotel were great for finding great shopping, cafes and an afternoon bottle of wine. We stayed a week in late September in room 309, a Jr. Suite located on the 4th floor. We did not have a view of the Arch but knew that and preferred the Jr. Suite. I must admit that our first impression of the Jr. Suite was disappointing as it did not look as grand as the picture on the web site, but we soon got used to it and were very very happy with our choice. It was a bit expensive, but I'm guessing that is just Paris. The bathrooms appear to be reasonably new and are very well appointed. I was pleasantly surprised just how well done they were. We asked that the twin beds be converted to a king which they took care of for us. The appointments are minimal but very efficient. We had two very grand windows, one in each room, that opened up onto the street. Our view, while not of the ADT, was of a normal Paris street, and we found it very nice. The adjacent room was small but also very efficent and included a TV, mini bar and small table. All better than we expected. The in room internet sucked but they have a free internet station downstairs that was almost always available and it worked great. We did not request the breakfast package and did not use the bar, so I dont have any thoughts on those. The strength of the Hotel Splendid is the staff. They are remarkable.

The hotel is about 1 block from the Arc de Triomphe, but unfortunately our room wasn't on a floor where you could see it. The building in front of us blocked the view. For the price, I expected softer beds. Other reviews mentioned that they are hard. They really are hard and low to the ground. We had a 2 room suite. The first room had 2 twin beds and the second room had 1 twin bed. The second room would have been nicer if there had been an air conditioning vent in it. It got fairly warm in there. Each room had a small balcony. They were nice, but you couldn't leave the windows open all night since Paris seems to have endless sirens going. Besides the sirens, the hotel is next to busy streets. With the double windows closed, this is no problem. The bathroom was nice. We never did figure out what that one fixture was (it didn't seem to be a bidet). It was hard not to get the floor wet since the shower only had a half door. It also took a while to get hot water. The staff was pretty nice, especially when we had trouble opening the door, danced on the entry stairs, when the air conditioner lost power, and when we filled the bathroom with wet clothes (they later found us a nearby laundromat). The elevator really only holds 3 people, so they have to bring your luggage on a separate elevator. We never tried the breakfast. The location is convenient for several restaurants, a convenience store, and of course the Champs de Elysees. The hotel has Wi-Fi, but we didn't bring a computer. We enjoyed their free internet computer, but it was in something of a closet with no air conditioning and you had to stand.

Anyway, back to the hotel. We stayed in a superior room, room 403- with the exceptional view of the Arc from the balcony- probably fairer to call it a balcony rather than a terrace by the way, wouldn't really be able to hold a cocktail party out there! The room was MUCH bigger than I had expected, should even impress Americans. It had an entrance hall, bathroom off it, and a door to the bedroom that could be shut, so there is an extra level of privacy from the bathroom to the bedroom if you get my drift. Good size wardrobe, good flat screen TV, but dodgy air conditioning- we couldn't get it to move from freezing or off, but to be honest we are low maintenace guests, we reported it once and then didn't worry about it again. Fussy people would probably be whingeing round about now I expect. Tiny lift up- as per usual in Paris- charming lobby, bar area, and a little ( unairconditioned) phone box size room with an internet connected PC ( free to use) for all those people who aren't bringing laptops on holidays with them, but still need to check emails etc. As per this sites advise, we didn't eat at the hotel- Farouk in fact pointed out a great breakfast cafe down the road a bit , where he goes- much better than the place over the road. It really is ridiculously handy for transport- RER station right outside the door, Cab rank 10 metres away, metro stop 200 metres, and the 14 euro Air France bus to CDG airport just over the road- brilliantly located. We strolled under the Arc to the Champs Elysee for people watching, and visited quite a few of the local bars/ bistros where the Euro's were on TV every night.

We bought the round-trip shuttle bus tickets from Air France, at the airport, to take us to the hotel. Visit the Air France Shuttle website to find where the ticket window is in the terminal. It was very, very easy as it drops you off across the street and the buses run very early in the morning until very late at night and it's got to be the cheapest way, less then 20 Euros each. Our room was small, #408, but a good size for a European hotel. It was just the right size for us. It had a very roomy closet and safe. We had a double bed instead of 2 twins. We had a beautiful balcony overlooking the VERY busy street below, but when the doors were closed we heard nothing! We had a very, very partial view of the Arc de Triomphe and were satisfied with that. There was a mini-bar which we used to store our leftover cheese and wine. We used the wine glasses from the mini-bar every night and they were replaced with new ones each day. The bathroom was spacious except for the toilet area behind the door--it was a little tight. The hot water was reported as coming and going, but we didn't really have a problem with this. Sure, sometimes it fluctuated, but not intolerable by any means. What we were not told upon check-in was to drop the GIANT room key off at the front desk when you leave the hotel for the day, so keep that in mind when you head out. The staff was very helpful, kind and English speaking. Our room was always cleaned promptly and sometimes twice a day! The hotel is in a good location. Don't fear the metro--very easy and we were there during the transportation strike. We walked everywhere--Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, Louvre, Pompidou within 30 minutes, 45 for farther out places like the Pompidou-- and it is very doable except for the Sacre Couer area---too far by foot, VERY easy by metro and the metro pops up right in front of the hotel, or take the stairs around the corner from the hotel door. For affordable wine and cheese, turn left out of the hotel doors and head to the end of the street. There's a grocery store there with a good selection. There's a patisserie across the street from there with good bread and pastries. For a great meal, head straight out the hotel doors, cross the street , go to the end of the block, cross the street again and have the Etoile plate at the Etoile restaurant. You get an appertif, appetizer, entree and dessert for a good price ( not so good with the sinking dollar). For breakfast, there are Brioche Dorees on every corner and they have excellent coffees and breakfast foods at good prices 1.5 to 3 Euros. Paris is very easy to get around and nearly everyone knows some English. It is nice, however, to try to use the limited French provided in travel books.

It was my first time traveling based on reviews from Tripadvisor.com Well, I learned that I am not looking for the same things as most travelers. Everyone seems concerned with how posh and quiet it is. I am only 34 and when I go out of town, I want to experience the city. The hotel plays a large part in that experience as I am always going too and from it. The neighborhood is nice, but a sleepy bedroom community, for Paris that is. While sightseeing you have to pass all the fun communities with plentiful cafes and parks to come back to the Splendid. I would have preferred a hotel in the 6th, 5th near the Pantheon or Ile de la Cite, after visiting them. There you have more cafes with the chairs on the sidewalks in rows, and art galleries and tons of unique boutiques, bakeries and more. That being said, it may be the perfect hotel for those who want peace and quiet ( though there is a bar down the sidestreet, that you can hear drunks yelling sometimes. I ran to my balcony to watch, excited by the prospect of life, they were too far to see though.) The streets had few people and no street life. Granted, it was August. The Champs is very close, but mostly just a bunch of shops I have here. Walk through it on your way to somewhere. The Arc de Triomphe is close, but once you have seen it... The hotel was nice. I paid a little more than I wanted to because of the reviews on here. I would have gladly paid more for a more idealized Parisian neighborhood and atmosphere. Like on TV, and that is what you get in the other neighborhoods I mentioned. I had some form of junior suite. Walk through the door,then a little cloakroom or place to put luggage and hang coats with a door that shut it from the bedroom, then the bedroom, pretty windows that sealed off traffic noise, a balcony, then to the right of the bedroom is a little sitting room, and off of that the bathroom, which was very nice and large for Europe. Semi-mildewy shower curtain. The room had a balcony and a view of a pretty Cap-Gemini Consulting office building. Nothing at all to look at to the left or the right. Breakfast was good! I liked it. Not too different from other hotels I have stayed at in London. Bins with eggs, bacon and sausage in one small area, and a longer table with breads, meats, cheeses, fruit, cereal and beverages. The entire breakfast room is smaller than most master bedrooms in the U.S. I look forward to breakfast as I like to see the other travelers and get my bearings for the day. There is not a bar that I noticed and no place where other patrons congregate or one can talk to the staff in a less formal manner. Overall, a nice place, but not worth the #8 spot on here in my opinion. Not even close.

I complained at reception that I'd asked and been promised a room with a view of the Arc de Triumphe and had paid a premium - was told that all rooms were fully booked and there was no possibility of being moved.

I've visited Paris with my other half quite a few times and have always been very pleased with the quality of the hotels.

When we requested to change to a room with one bed, the front desk staff replied that they could change our bed to one bed instead of moving us. We were happy but we returned in the night only to find that they had not changed our bed to one bed but instead had used one sheet instead of two. We felt cheated. When we talked to them again, they said we either deal with the two twin beds or we had to move to a room in the back facing the courtyard. Our room had PAPER THIN WALLS. It was very noisy. We could hear conversations from neighboring rooms and people walking around and opening and closing doors. In the morning we would hear loud noises coming from elevator and kitchen. The door to our room had no dead bolt or chain link. One time the MAID WALKED IN ON US while we were sleeping. The bathroom was extremely small. The bathroom sink drained poorly. The shower water pressure would change depending on usage in other rooms so the WATER TEMPERATURE COULD CHANGE FROM VERY HOT TO VERY COLD as we were showering. The hair dryer handle would get so hot that I needed to wrap it with a towel in order to continue using it. The AC IN OUR ROOM DID NOT WORK AT ALL. One night when we got back to the hotel, the hotel staff were trying to pry open the ELEVATOR DOOR WHICH GOT STUCK WITH PEOPLE INSIDE !!!

The room is beautifully appointed, lovely furniture, chandeliers, flat screen tv, decent closet space. The view is great- The hotel is next to the Arc de Triumph- ask for a view room- its worth it.

The view from our room was fabulous -- we could see not only the Arc but also the Eiffel Tower -- you just can't get any better than that! We felt so charmed and special and delighted by this! We loved having the suite because with jet lag, sometimes one of us was up in the living room reading or watching TV, while the other was in the bedroom sleeping. There were pocket door separating the two so it was very handy. Other reviews mention the busy traffic and quietness of the rooms. We were astounded by the fact that the thick curtains, which are drawn at night over closed windows, TOTALLY blocked out the sounds of traffic, sirens, and helicopters. Yes, helicopters! The first morning we were there, there was some type of traffic accident or medical emergency on the round about around the Arc. Many, many emergency vehicles came including a helicopter, presumably to remove the injured. Traffic came to a dead standstill, and probably caused havoc throughout this part of Paris. We walked to the Eiffel Tower at night (the concierge said it was about 15 minutes but that must be in 'french walk speed' as it took us about 30 minutes. We thoroughly enjoyed the walk and especially loved seeing the tower lit up. We took a cab back and it was only 6 euro, well worth it as our feet were tired by then. We also got brave and took the Metro (subway) to the Louvre, based on Farooq's advice. The entrance to the Metro is right next to the hotel - it can't get any easier! We also took the Air France bus from DeGualle Airport based on Farooq's advice and were happy we did. It was only $13euro each and let us off directly across from the hotel. That was amazing! The evening concierges recommended two restaurants that were very good. One was a brasserie just 2 blocks away, and the other was a small restaurant about 3 blocks away. Both were excellent though the bill at the restaurant was scary -- $188 euro, but we chalked that up to being in Paris! I would definitely stay at this hotel each and every future visit to Paris.

She did eventually give in and speak some English to us (though she was clearly fluent), but it was clear that she was not happy. She was the only Parisian that we met during out stay that was seemed put out by my lack of fluent French -most were kind and friendly. There were 3 concierges that we met, two of which we dealt with. We feel that they must of had some sort of agreement with a nearby restaurant. We had asked each one separately to try to get us a reservation at one of TEN restaurants that we had chosen, and they both said that ALL of the ten were likely closed for August- though they never picked up the phone to check. We then explained that we wanted a very fine dining experience (after all, we were in Paris!). They both opened the cabinet behind them and promptly pulled out the exact same flyer and told us this was the place to go. We acquiesced, and one of them made the reservation. The restaurant was decent, but certainly not fine. The food was overcooked and the menu was limited. The room (room 405) itself was a decent size (Paris standards) and nicely appointed, but the bed was hard as rocks and the pillows were almost useless. There was a nice desk, a large closet, and an in room safe.

However, I am surprised that the reviews did not mention the b/fast area. The hotel has approx. 57 rooms but only 8 tables in the b/fast area!! We waited for15 min. one morning for a table and thereafter went down REALLY early to get a table without having to wait. The staff in the hotel are friendly but I must say that the lady who runs the b/fast room made our stay very unpleasant. she run it like it was a military and it was very regimental-it would not have hurt her to smile once in a while. Two tips - I agree with a recent review that complained about 'rip off' taxi fares. We approached taxi driver directly outside hotel to ask how much it would be to take 4 of us to CDG, he quoted 30-35 Euros. When I asked Concerige, he said it would be 70 Euros, so you can guess who we chose!! So advice is, you are better off arranging your own taxi. Secondly, we decided to take the Air France shuttle to hotel on arrival ,again based purely on T.A. reviews. The only problem with that is that if you arrive in Terminal 3 as we did, you have to lug all of your luggage to Terminal 2 to catch shuttle. You have a long walk then catch the CDGVal to get shuttle. The journey from the airport to hotel, which stops right outside door, took one and a half hours, hence the reason for taking the taxi back to CDG. This might not bother some people but it's worth mentioning. The lift only carries 3 people which again is a problem if there are more of you in your party and during our 5 day stay, the bar was not open at all. All in all, our stay was a pleasant one and I would probably stay there again if only for the location but I was slightly disappointed that it didn't entirely live up to all the hype which is a shame.

First of all, the beds are hard as rocks and instead of bed pillows, they only have shams on the beds - a big change from my last stay. The concierges' recommendations for restaurants were in most cases not worthwhile choices. More importantly, beware of the practice of some of the concierges to make arrangements with the hotel car driver to rip you off for local cab rides. We had agreed on a 30 Euro price one night ,(there were 5 of us) but were charged 50 Euros when we got back to the hotel! Farouq (the head concierge) met with me, apologized, and said that he knows the concierges should not try to rip off tthe customers by conspiring with the car drivers to pad the bill so they can make extra money, but beyond his apology, nothing else happened. After that, I called for our own cabs. When we checked out, we were charged for internet service in our rooms (when we had no computers with us!!) and over 35 Euros for long-distance phone calls which we did not make (as we used only our cell phones to make satellite calls). They took off the computer charge, but not the phone calls. When I returned home, I e-mailed and wrote the General Manager of the hotel (in French) and asked for a refund. I never even received a response, let alone a refund.

The Air France bus shuttle from the airport stops right across the street and the Metro entrance is also within a block. We often took the Metro to our destination (Louve, D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Orsay, Latin Quarter etc.) and enjoyed the walk back to the Splendid Etoile taking different routes each day. Our room, number 503, had a nice view of the Arc and a pleasant balcony to enjoy the signs and sound of Paris. The room was a reasonable size and clean. The housekeeping staff is very good and on numerous occasions returned while we were out for dinner to tidy up the room. The concierge staff was fluent in English and provided friendly and helpful guidance. There is a nice convenience store just a block away which was great for morning fruit and yogurt. Unfortunately for us the bakery located at the end of Carnot Ave was open for only one day and then closed for vacation for the balance of our stay. It is a superb option for breakfast coffee, bread and pastries. We tried several of the restaurants within a short distance from the hotel and found L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Arc, Lateral and Grande Armee to be decent.

As a matter of fact I do think the room itself needs renovation. Before I checked out, I asked to keep a superior room for my return. I was told they would try, if no superior room they would give me a junior suite at the same price. I gladly said thank you thinking about the photo I saw from the \"candid travelers' photos\"...only to be disappointed later. When I returned (late in the evening), the only room available was junior suite on the first floor...I went in gladly, only to find out it's a standard room (with no TV), attached with a small room that looked nowhere like the \"candid traveler's photo of junior suite\", that had no door in between, that had a make-shift kind of sofa bed with the TV and the bathroom. Wait...the most terrible thing I found was...there was no aircon but a big monster \"cooling\" machine about the size of a mid-sized fridge, which ridiculously split hot air out from the back of the machine back to inside the room!!! I could not open the window as it's on first floor hence too noisy. Apparently they told me all the rooms on 1st floor were all equipped with such monster only. I asked to change to a standard room but they said they did not have other room anymore. So they left a note for the front desk to arrange another room the next day if available. I was so upset...fortunately when I returned the next evening they gave me the magic room X07!!! That solved all the problems. I must say all the staff had very good attitude.

The view of course was incredible - talk about ambience! All the balconies had French doors with double glass which truly blocked the sounds of the streets below. We opted for the noise of the city and enjoyed a lovely breeze. The beds were comfortable, with crisp linens and extra pillows that were found in the closet.

So off we went, bags in tow, following him to our destination -- it's a memory I won't soon forget! Overall, our brief stay at the Spendid Etoile was wonderful. My only regret is that travel plans did not allow us to stay another night. The common areas are not large or fancy - if you need an impressive lobby, go to the Meridian or the Westin.

We enjoyed our stay very much. We booked a \"superior\" room through Travelocity (with an airfare package) for about 175 Euros (225 dollars) per night. For a 5th floor balcony room (503) with a full view of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris right next to a Metro stop and an Air France express bus, it is a steal! Our room was OK size for Europe, with two twin beds pushed together. (Hard foam mattresses that we liked, although the linens were very cheap feeling/scratchy -- definitely not the Westin Heavenly Bed!) Very nice marble bathroom with a tub/shower with very powerful water pressure. To get a good feel for the superior rooms in comparison to the regular rooms, go to the hotel's website -- they show them both. A great thing about this hotel is that the front desk staff and the concierge speak English. Before we left for Paris, we heard that \"everyone speaks English.\" We can tell you that this is nonsense. Everybody speaks English there like everybody speaks French in the United States. So having hotel staff that can get you pointed in the right direction when you arrive was very helpful. So the rooms are nice; the front desk staff are great; the lobby is cute (although smoking is allowed there); the maid service was exceptional; and it has an in-house restaurant for breakfast and dinner (it seemed vacant most of the time). We cannot comment on the food because we didn't eat there. However, we can tell you that the breakfast is 22 Euros (which based on the current exchange rate is about 29 dollars). Who needs a $29 breakfast? We ate the best baguettes/coissants we have ever had and a cup of coffee for breakfast like the locals for about 2 Euros. This leads us to tell you about the hotel's location. It is about perfect. It is surrounded by a hundred nearby restaurants of every type and plenty of convenience stores for snacks, beverages, toiletries, etc. Also, we found the French people to be courteous, friendly, helpful -- simply wonderful. Everywhere we went there were proud Parisians anxious to share their beautiful city. We felt honored to be among them all. One sidebar on the hotel reservation process to tell you about: We paid for a superior room and confirmed a high floor with a view of the Arc de Triomphe by email and by telephone. But when we arrived, they assigned us to a 1st floor room with a view of nothing. If you pay for the superior room upgrade, stand your ground like we did and we think you will find the staff willing to accomodate you appropriately -- they accomodated our request with little fuss. All in all, it is a very nice little city hotel in a great, safe, residential and commercial neighborhood near one of the city's greatest monuments. We highly recommend it and would stay there again (although maybe not at the current Superior room rack rate of 300 Euros!)", "Date": "May 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cThis is the only place I will stay in Paris\u201d", "Author": "bbotch", "ReviewID": "UR7552938", "Content": "There are so many great things about this hotel, but I will highlight the most important: 1) Coincierge staff is fantastic and set you up with reservations at great restaurants, off the beaten path of regular tourist traps 2) the view of the Arc d'triomphe from your bedroom.

Chose this Hotel based mainly on Tripadvisor's high ratings. We knew we were going to arrive at close to midnight from Venice, by Air France coach, hence the obvious choice was to choose this Hotel since we simply cross the road and the Hotel is located right at the corner of Ave Carnot. We were rather happy with our request for a corner room, which offers us 3 balconies with superb views of the Arc de Triomphe. Room was large even by European standards, bed was really really comfortable and the bathroom was simply long and huge! The view at night of the Arc was especially memorable ..... Location wise, it is very close to the Metro/RER and shopping in Champs Elysees. Even the Lido Cabaret show was very nearby. However, beware of the underground tunnel closing after 10pm or 11pm. When we were walking back to the Hotel after the Lido show, at around 11.15pm. We had to back tracked and walk above grounds instead. I was a little annoyed cos I emailed the Hotel before my trip and was told to walk back to the Hotel via the underground tunnel? As for breakfasts, managed to catch a glimpse of what's on offer - in my honest opinion, doesn't seem to be worth 22 euros. Right across the Street, you can find nice Cafes which offer breakfast sets at 7.50 or 8.50 euros per person. Finally, I did not grant this wonderful Hotel a full 5 stars rating cos of the lack of atmosphere in the common areas. I thought they should invest some money in decorating the reception and common areas so as to create a cosy/romantic Parisian ambience, which is why millions are visiting Paris each year. After two nights here, we stayed another two nights at the Paris Le-Grand near the Paris Opera, which is by far the most beautiful Parisian hotel I had stayed at (see my review under Paris Le-Grand).", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "california", "Title": "\u201cA FANTASTIC HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "SMC514", "ReviewID": "UR7487328", "Content": "After countless hours of research of Paris hotels..Splendid Etoile was our choice.

He knows everything about Paris and is a huge asset to the property. - The Air France shuttle drops you off right across the street (buy a round trip ticket upon boarding at the airport) .The metro is also across the street and is very easy to use (buy a carnat of 10 tickets to save $) -The view was breathtaking from our room. Even though you probably won't spend alot of time there..it is nice to see the Arc de Triomphe each day you wake up and go to bed. -The room was better than expected. The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. It was larger than a normal European room. The bathtub was the extra long too. -The coffee at the hotel is some of the best we have ever tasted. Order it through room service. -You can bypass the crosswalks to the Champs Elysees by taking the tunnel under the Arc de Triomphe. The stairs are on the same block as the hotel To do: * buy a museum pass * don't miss Montmartre (Sacre Cour) * Arc at night * Louvre early in the morning before it opens * L'Orangerie Museum (Monet) * Rodin Museum * Take the double decker bus tour for one day if it's your first visit to Paris.

The hotel is in a perfect location - 1 minute from the Arc D'triumph. In fact, from our room (406) you could open the window, walk onto the balcony, and there it was to the right. In addition there were plenty of bars and restaurants and cafe's within just a few minutes walk. Access to the RER rail system was just outside the front door, whilst the nearest Metro station was only five mins away. Check in and check out were quick, efficient and friendly and the reception staff were all extremely friendly and more than willing to speak (very good) English. The room was a good size, well decorated, comfortable and clean - as was the bathroom. No doubt the hotel is great - but there was one minor irritation which is why I've not given it a 5 rating (I've probably been a bit tight with my scoring, but 5 should be perfection). The cleaner has a store cupboard next to the bathroom of our room (406). The cleaners started banging around in the cupboard at about 8.00am and because it was right next to a hollow, fully tiled bathroom, the sound was quite loud. So my only quibble is - if you want to have an undisturbed late lie in bed, room 406 is not the room to have.", "Date": "February 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "mbm27", "ReviewID": "UR6812002", "Content": "My fiancee and I stayed here for 3 nights earlier this month, and it was everything and more than I could have hoped for!

This was my second trip to Paris. The last time I stayed at Hotel Lutetia on the left bank. The Hotel Splendid Etoile has a classic Parisian facade. It is very clean throughout. The common areas (lobby, lounge, breakfast room) are small, but nice. The the rooms are relatively spacious (by European standards - American's may find the rooms a bit cozy.) The beds were firm, but comfortable. The bathrooms were clean and modern. Wireless internet access is available in the rooms, although the connectivity, like that in may hotels, was sometimes spotty. The elevators are very small as in many in older properties where they were obviously retrofitted. Three normal size adults will fit snuggly inside without baggage. Two adults with standard roller bags will fit. So be prepared to smile and make friends. Forget what people say about the French being rude. The staff at this hotel is very courteous, attentive, and helpful. Desk personnel politely switched to English when ever I stumbled over my French. The concierge was cheerfully able to accommodate my requests for last minute dinner reservations at some of the city's more popular restaurants. A buffet breakfast is typically included with the room. The breakfast room is small, but was never overcrowded. The offerings were well rounded including all the necessities for a proper English breakfast or classic American breakfast. A small restaurant is attached to the front of the hotel. But there are many other great dining options within walking distance so be adventurous. The hotel's location is great. It is within steps of the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees. So getting a cab is easy. It is also just a few blocks away from the city's convention center. A metro station is located directly across the street from the hotel. Regardless of whether you want to take in the sights or attend meetings, getting around town from the hotel is easy. Getting to and from the hotel from the airport is also easy. Taking the advice of another TripAdvisor reviewer, I took the Air France shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel. The bus picks up and drops off across the street from the hotel. The cost is just 13e each way - 4e cheaper than taking the RER and Metro and a lot less than taking a cab. You can buy tickets on the bus or from the hotel's front desk. Air France provides an attendant to load and unload your luggage from the bus. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel.

The location of the hotel is prime for two reasons: it is extremenly convenient to the Metro and the fabulous views of the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triompe. Walk outside of the hotel, take 20 steps and you are at an elevator that whisks you down to the Metro and RER stations. There are lots of decent cafes and great shopping within walking distance. The hotel itself exceeded my high expectations. Front desk, bellmen, concierge staff, housekeeping and dining room staff were 100% friendly, proffesional and accurate in their recommendations. Our suite, 606, had a postcard view of the Arc and Eiffel Tower which was especially wonderful at night. Quality of bedding and bathroom linens were okay. Not bad, but not luxurious. This did not impede our enjoyment of the hotel, but I mention it just in case it is important to others. Room was very tastefully decorated and whisper-quiet even with all of the traffic whizzing by the Arc just yards away. Farouq is quite an ambassador for the hotel and Paris. His calm professionalism and friendly manner were most appreciated as we got our bearings in the big city of Paris. My wife asked him about onion soup for lunch one day and he said, \"come with me\" and walked with us about 3-4 minutes to a nearby cafe and introduced us to the Maitre d'. The meal was great, the service very attentive, and we appreciated the VIP treatment that Farouq provided. One other opinion to share: when in Paris, don't underestimate the importance of access to the Metro. Taxis are pretty reasonable price-wise but can be hard to find, and traffic jams eat up a lot of your time. You simply can't walk everywhere you want to go. Having a metro stop just outside the door make it easy to whisk down to the Louvre for a few minutes to see the building and pyramids at night, zip over to the Eiffel Tower for a coffee, and be back in your room all within 90 minutes, having spent only a few Euro. Taxis are pretty reasonable price-wise but can be hard to find, and traffic jams eat up a lot of your time. The bottom line is that this is an excellent hotel even without the beautiful view, and nearly unbeatable when you factor it in. We left Paris and after a few days in Amsterdam we returned and stayed at the Four Seasons Georges V, and I found the differences in quality and service to be fairly small considering the astronomic difference in price.

The only thing we did not like about the hotel were the towels. We're used to plush towels both at home and away; theirs were very thin and we felt we could never be dry enough. Oh well, one small ripple in a sea of superlatives. Paris is lovely and the people absolutely delightful. I do not know why Parisians have gotten such a bad rap from Americans. Maybe its from people who have never traveled there. They are polite and respectul people who went out of their way to help us; total strangers on the metro and on the street offered to help us find our way when they saw fumbling with our maps. I speak a little French, but most people wanted to speak English to us. We went to every neighborhood and tourist attraction you can imagine so we got a pretty good taste of the entire city. We always felt safe; no one at all bothered us. If you must see anything in Paris, don't miss the Louvre (Sundays it's free admission, as it's on Wednesdays after 3:00 p.m and the lines are short); Musee Orsay; Saint Chapelle; the ride up to the top of the Eiffel Tower; and if you have time, Versailles and Giverny (Claude Monet's home) which the hotel can arrange for about 143 euros per person for an 8 hour trip). All around this was the best vacation we've ever taken. We're already planning our next vacation to Paris, quite simply the most wonderful city in the world. We would consider the Spledid Etoile for our next stay, but we would probably stay some where else just to try a new hotel.

Found it to be exactly as others describle. I thought the room was great, rm 403. Big bathroom, lots of closet/drawer space, excellent a/c and 2 french doors to the balcony with view of Arc. The hotel never seemed crowded, the staff was helpful and spoke excellent English. I like that you never had to carry your key around they hold it at the front desk. We did return every night after the doors were locked and never waited more than a few minutes for them to open it for us. The hotel was very centralized, the Metro across the street is on the popular line that goes down the Champs Elysees -Louvre, very convenient. We also went to Versailles ourselves and it was about an hour total between taking 2 trains. Taxi stand was right in front of the hotel and it was never hard to get a taxi. Also we got the AirFrance shuttle \"navette\" (it's more like a bus) to and from the airport, 12E each way. Slightly confusing taking to the hotel, very easy taking it back. Make sure you have the hotel confirm your terminal before leaving since we got off on the wrong one and had to take another bus to the right one! We ate at the cafe La Flame around the corner for dinner/drinks on 2 occaisons, reasonable prices, great atmosphere. We also ate a fast breakfast one morning at the \"Quick\" fast food place 2 blocks away. We also at a few places along the Champs, Madigral and L'Alsace.... service was ok, food was mediocre, very pricey. Laduree was excellent!! We loved Barrio Latino in the Bastile area, great food and great music, dance floor was packed and fun to watch. We also liked the food court in the Lourve for a quick lunch. Le Petit Pont was a nice place to eat right across from Notre Dame, we also liked the live jazz at Le Caveau de la Hauchette. Lots of bars/cafes/nightlife on that street. We saw the Lido show and the Crazy Horse cabaret, Farooq the concierge, booked our tickets, he charged us 32E as a \"fee\", the seats were great and we did get free champagne at the Lido, but just be aware he has a booking fee. Both shows were great I would recommend both. We did the entire city in 8 days, there is so much to see, we walked a million miles and the weather was hot for September, 85F.

Booked direct with hotel. Before arriving emailed hotel to ask for a room with a view as it was a special occasion and our first time to Paris. They responded letting us know that a room had been allocated to us which we would like. On arrival, we arrived at 10.30am and didn't expect to be able to check in so early, however, we were greeted by Farook and given our room key by reception. Farook took our cases up to our room in a separate lift(not very big). We opened the door and walked in through the hallway/dressing area. Wow!! What a view, we had a corner room and the view was the Arc de Triomphe. Over in the distance to the right we could see the Eiffel Tower. There was again an excellent view from the bathroom and we had a balcony which we could walk right from the bathroom, past the side bedroom window and in the front window (which overlooked Avenue Carnot. The view of the Arc de Triomphe was exactly that of the brochure and seen in the website and truly is amazing. Bedroom and bathroom were both excellent, very clean and decent sizes. There was a small dressing area as you first walk in the room with wardrobe and safe, to the door in front was the bathroom, with full size bath, shower over bath, toilet and bidet. Was lovely sitting in the bath, window open listening the traffic whizz round the Arc. Toiletries supplied in bathroom and replaced when used as were the towels, although the towels do need replacing as they were quiet thin and not very luxurious for that of a 4star hotel. Large double bed in bedroom with dressing table, table and chair next to one window and tv with drinks cabinet in the corner. Also had suit stand and suitcase rack. Nicely decorated. Take time at night or in the day to sit on the balcony watching the traffic zoom round the Arc, interweving lanes and listening to the car horns beeping. Would recommend a radio in the room or at least have some music channels on the tv so you can listen French music whilst there. Internet access also available in room. There is a mini bar, but this is very expensive, do as someone else suggested and use grocers down the street and first on right for water etc. Staff were very good at all times, ordered taxis when required and were courteous and pleasant when entering/leaving hotel. If you are planning on staying out after 12pm be careful as they lock the front doors and yo have to ring the bell for the porter to let you in. We arrived back one night about 12.30 and were waiting short time to go in hotel. Had drinks one afternoon after busy day in bar but these were expensive, for a whisky and ginger and a beer it came to 18 euros. Didn't use restaurant as there were plently of wonderful places to eat but menu looked decent and it did look a nice place. Breakfast wasn't included and costs 16 euros for continental or 23euros for English so we ate this out. Couple of places in the area that we can recommend to go for dinnere are Etoile, which is a couple of blocks to the front of hotel on the corner and the Beer Station which is on the same street nearer to the hotel. Dinner at the Etoile was 32 euros for glass of tatinger, entre, main and dessert with coffee. Excellent food and very good waiters. Had booked Le Ciel De Paris for our Friday night dinner and this was an experience worth trying at least once. It's located in Tour Montparnasse which is a distance from the hotel, we took a taxi but there is a metro right outside the tower. You're taken by lift to the 56th floor in what seems like seconds and as you walk into the restaurant the view is fabulous, the Eiffel Tower is directly opposite the panoramic windows and at night Paris sparkles below with all the landmarks on show. Food was extremely good and the staff are very attentive. It's a must try for anyone. The metro station is right outside the hotel and from there you can go just about anywhere in Paris, we bought carnets of tickets which cost just over 10 euros for 10 and you use one for each journey not each line so you can get about very cheaply. The Metro is easy to use and understand and very safe. It can be tiring though going up and down the numerous steps and can be warm so take water with you to drink whilst waiting. Most stations shows how long there is to wait for next two trains which is a very good idea. We had three night in Paris and these flew by, managed to visit the Eiffel Tower(very busy), The Louvre, Musee D'Orsay, Pompidou Centre, Galleries Lafeyette, Notre Dame, Hotel del Invalides, Sacre Coure and Montmarte as well as take a boat trip along the Seine and wonder briefly through St Germaine and walk the Champs Elysee. There is so much to do and you could easily fill a week, taking time to relax with a book and some wine watching the world go by. Would we return, yes, to the Hotel Splendid and Paris.

We booked the Splendid Etoile by the positive reviews on Trip Advisor months ago for our 30th wedding anniversary getaway and it ended up being exactly what we wanted. Our room was #207 and it was perfect. Having a corner room wrap around balcony, with three floor to ceiling french doors - one in the bath and two in the bedroom/sitting area. French furnishings, a crystal chandelier and a large marble bathroom. A flat screen tv too! not that you will be watching much tv but a daily news report in English was nice to keep in touch with the world even while on vacation. This was our first trip to Paris and we wanted a hotel that was quaint, French, accommodating, clean, convenient to the Metro/transportation and near the Champs Elysees for evening walks. The Splendid fit all of our needs. The location was a few blocks from the Champs but was surprisingly quiet even with the french doors opened. The location is near many restaurants, cafes, bars, bakeries, wine shops, etc. Also the CDG/Air France bus stops on the opposite corner so getting to and from the airport is a breeze and less expensive than taking a cab. Buy the round trip ticket for the bus for a good deal. The Metro stop was right outside the door of the hotel and we used only the Metro for getting around the city. We also booked a couple of excursions thru a travel company that picked us up by minivan at the door of the Splendid Etoile as well. Walking to the Champs Elysees a few evenings for dinner and people watching was very nice and a lovely stroll among the neighborhood getting there. The staff--especially Farooq-- was the best. Always greeted us and spoke perfect English, thank goodness, since our French consisted of only a few words and phrases. Farooq was very knowledgable and more than accommodating about any questions we had, going over and above aiding us with helpful hints, good suggestions and general French info. He is by far the best concierge we have ever used! The rest of the staff were also very pleasant and helpful. The room we booked was a superior and very spacious, clean, with a french style decor-- silk wall coverings, draperies, furnishings, and the balcony with a wonderful view of the Arc d' Triomphe!!!! We never had breakfast or dinner at the hotel so we can not comment on the dining experience at the hotel. But right across the street is a nice restaurant \" L'Emporieur\" that had a delicious menu. We never had a bad meal there.........ate a few breakfasts and dinners there. Authentic french fare........duck, chicken with mustard sauce, jambon and fromage sandwiches, omelets, chocolate crescents........And the best steak, potatoes and dessert we had in the city all week was at this little cafe! And that is saying a lot since we didnt have a bad meal all week no matter where we happened to eat.....from the bakeries, street fare, bistros or expensive restaurants.........

To say we were not disappointed is an understatement. Our experience was fantastic. We had no complaints, period. None. Our room was marvelous, the service was genuinely friendly yet unobtrusive and the location was perfect. We chose the latter based on having stayed in the 17th before, and because the hotel is so centrally located. The CDG-Etoile Metro station is across the street (and there's an elevator right out front), as is the Air France drop-off. One block to the east on Rue de Tilsitt is a little place called the Beer Station, which has great food. One block farther east, on Avenue Wagram, is La Croissanterie, which is the place to go for breakfast (gourmet pastries, delicious coffee, at fast-food prices). And you're one block from the Arc de Triomphe, which we got so used to seeing out our room's window that we started not to notice after a while. (!) The CDG Metro station gets you anywhere you want to go, either directly or with, at most, one transfer. It's a long walk to the Eiffel Tower, and a long walk down the Champs to the Louvre, so don't expect to roll out of bed and be there. But that's not what the 17th is about, anyway. It's about quiet. And our room was quiet. Even though we were on the 2nd floor, we heard nothing because of the pair of double-double doors that shut out all noise. Not that we kept them shut all the time, because our room (207) had a wonderful wrap-around balcony (one of only two in the hotel). One set of doors looked out at the Arc, which was nice. The room was surprisingly large by Paris standards. The adjacent room is of the same class, but not as large. Room 207 is considered the second-best room in the hotel (aside from the suite on top) because of its size and because it has the huge balcony. Our room came wonderfully appointed with matching curtains/furniture coverings/bedspread (the latter of which they were nice enough to take off after the first day; we didn't need it) and a nice sitting area. The ceilings were nice and tall, so the twin doors let in a lot of light. The bathroom was also well-appointed, with nice fixtures, a wall safe, and two mirrors. The shower is a typical European shower, with one glass half-door and a high step-in. If you haven't used one before, you'll probably freak, at least initially. It's no big deal. We can't say enough about the staff. They were so overwhelmingly helpful with our questions. We tried to speak as much French as we knew, but they all knew perfect English and usually helped us out of our verbal assault on their language. (One aside: There was a guest who, when asking questions in English only, was somewhat rude. He didn't receive the same treatment in return, although had we been on staff, he would have.) With La Croissanterie two really short blocks away, there's no need to eat in the hotel. Their breakfast is 16 euros which, like most Paris hotel breakfasts, no matter how good, invites you to take a morning stroll. One surprising note: We didn't buy a phone card this time, so we used the hotel phone. Expecting to be gouged, we weren't at all.

We chose this hotel based upon its fabulous location, and the positive TA reviews. Reservations were made on line, with hotel staff, who were very acommodating and pleasant via email. Our request for a room with a view of the Arc was granted, and we were given a lovely corner room with an updated marble bathroom. The hotel is rather plain and charmless, but the rooms are well-soundproofed and pretty, the location is fantastic and we were quite comfortable throughout our stay. Sadly, I cannot recommend the hotel, though. The front desk staff are not uniformly pleasant and helpful. I speak some high school/college french, and they all speak excellent english, so it was certainly not a language issue. We would have been happy to recommend the hotel, were it not for one extremely unpleasant incident. The airconditioning system in our room was not functioning properly, and we were startled to find one afternoon, a sopping wet rug beneath the ceiling unit -- apparently from dripping condensation. The moisture was so great that the unit also dripped water in to the adjacent closet where my husbands clothes were stacked on the shelf. His clothes were soaked. A poorly functioning airconditioner is certainly not reason to be unhappy with the hotel, but what happened next is. My husband took his wet clothes down to the front desk to explain the situation. He requested that the clothes be cleaned, and that someone come look at the unit. A very nice young man saw the soaked carpet, and sent a repairman shortly thereafter. As it was a Sunday, the repairman was not a professional, and did nothing to repair the unit. The next Monday, while breakfasting downstairs, the day manager approached us at our table. She told us that according to the repairman, there was nothing wrong with the airconditioning unit, and that if we wanted our clothes cleaned, we would have to pay for it. My husband and I were flabbergasted. We are very honest people, and would never THINK of creating such an elaborate scam to get clothes cleaned. I took the manager up to our room, where she saw the wet rug and visible water drips on the wall. This was her opportunity to offer up a heartfelt apology, but it never came. She insisted that it was reasonable policy to assume the worst of the guests (after all, just that morning, some guests had run off with 80 euros of mini-bar). She explained to me that, \"You would be surprised at the things people will do to get their laundry done.\" I found this behavior unprofessional and simply, unkind. Call me naive, but I thought people went in to the hospitality business because they genuinely like serving the public. This particular manager seemed not to like her job, let alone people.
