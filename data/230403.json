The room was small but that is expected for hotels in Europe. The washroom was also tiny but overall the room was clean and we felt safe. The downsides - the wifi was awful and rarely every worked. They had computers available in the lobby which were free to use but two out of the four did not work which meant waiting for long periods of time to get online. Note: they do not have a business centre so we were unable to print out tour vouchers or our boarding passes. The other downside was the front desk - they were not helpful at all and very rude! We asked for recommendations for restaurants, we inquired about one of tours and each time they could not help us! Many of the individuals working at the front desk did not speak english which made it difficult to even communicate at times. Overall, we thought the hotel was ok but I would not come back here strictly based on the service we received at the front desk. In my opinion, the front desk should be helpful, knowledgeable and friendly....at this hotel, they were none of the above!

We had a suite with bedroom, shower room and small dressing/TV room. Smallish rooms, but tall and not oppressive. Very clean, spotless bedding, changed every day. Shampoo etc, lots of towels. Luckily there was a heated ladder towel rail in the shower room as well as the air conditioning as we got soaked and snowed-on during our trip, and we could dry our coats quickly. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Breakfast and bar service good, but bar shuts at 10.30 - not what you want on a rugby tour. Having said that there are bars and restaurants all around the area, so you only have to walk a short way. Maybe it's best for the other guests who are not rugby fans to have a peaceful place for a quite drink. The hotel is only 5 mins walk from the Termini station and we got the train from there to the airport on leaving as we extended our stay by a day and the rest of the party resturned by coach on Sunday. The ticket machines were easy to use at the station, with commentary in English, and two tickets to the airport cost E28. We also had a 48-hour 'hop-on-hop-off' bus tour, paid in advance, to get our bearings, meaning to use it on the following day to get between sites and the Olympic Stadium. However, due to the snow the bus didn't run, so that was a bit of a waste of money. Not their fault though. We walked on average 10-12 miles per day, and saw all the main sites, but did not go into the Vatican or the Collesseum. We did, however, visit the church of St Clement, which has a beautiful church built on top of a 4th century church, which is built on top of a 1st century building which was used to celebrate the pagan Mithras. There is also a Romas house underground and you can visit it all for E5.

As two young women, we worried about safety as we traveled in a country where neither of us knew the language. Staying at this hotel was a great choice. It was centrally located to many attractions (we only once took the subway, and walked everywhere else to/from the hotel). It's also located near the train station, which is convenient for many (we flew). There are many restaurants and shops in this neighborhood, and we felt comfortable walking alone at night. Additionally, the staff was professional, knew quite a bit of English,and were friendly. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and attractive. In choosing a room, my friend was concerned about safety--break-ins, or feeling like a \"skeevy\" hotel staff would take from our room, and we definitely felt safe leaving valuables here. The hotel's rooftop patio bar was gorgeous, with views of the city and lots of flowers, a wonderful environment, especially at sunset. Included with the price of our room was breakfast each morning, which was plentiful in choices and food.

Depends on what your requirements are, but if you are fond of working internet connection, fresh morning cappuccino or more than one international tv channel, this is not your choice. We stayed for four nights in a triple room which consisted of two twin beds and a good size sofa bed. The room was outdated but decent size. It had a desk, a wobbly two door wardrobe, two nightstands, a minibar and a small TV. The only non-Italian channel we had was CNN with poor picture quality. The bathroom was spacious. However the shower was tiny with the shower curtain clinging to your body. By far the worst thing was the so-called internet connection. It is wireless but we could not log on with more than one device at a time and it is very slow. From the front desk you get a printed paper with a username and a password on it which allows you to use the internet for 24h from the first login. Every day you had to get new usernames and passwords which you had to insert every time you wanted to access the internet, they could not be saved in any way. Some of the passwords worked just once and after fifteen minutes of surfing it lost the connection and refused the password was supposed to work for 24h and you had to run downstairs to ask for a new piece of paper. In the lobby they had three computers which also needed the login which was good for one hour at a time. When it was time to charge the camera battery we found that the room had only three inconveniently placed sockets: one in the bathroom, one behind the desk for the TV and one behind the other nightstand by the floor. You had to choose whether to have the TV or desk light on with the desk socket. The room was very clean and nothing was stolen. However all towels and soaps were changed every day no matter where you had placed them. Seemed very unnecessary. Even though our window faced the street with a construction underway soundproofing worked and we got a good nights sleep every night. Sounds from other rooms could be heard though, but not badly. Airconditioning wasn't working all the time, there was some problem with the controls. We had to contact the reception four times before it was somewhat fixed. The breakfast was ok, no fresh fruit or vegetables (e.g. cucumber or tomato) though. Three different juices, bad quality machine coffee (espresso or cappuccino), croissants, breakfast rolls, toast, marmalade, chocolate spread, butter, one kind of cream cheese, one kind of ham, machine yogurt, muesli, cereal and canned pineapple/peach/plums. Breakfast was ok but still lacked freshness.

So we cann't say anything about it. For this reason we chose a hotel near the train station, bus terminal and the subway, which assured us the agility to get around town. Another quality hotel: good location. However, the last day, we experienced an unpleasant situation. We asked the clerk to schedule a taxi to take us to the airport at 3:00 am. The hotel clerk told us it would cost 50 euros. Upon arriving at the airport, the driver charged us 60 euros. We paid the amount charged to avoid hassles. However, I was upset and wrote to the hotel to tell them what happened. The hotel apologized for the robbery of the driver, notified the taxi company and repaid us 10 euros by post.

The location can't be beat- 10 minute walk to the Termini train station, 25 minute walk to the Collosseum and very close to the bus stops. Numerous cafes, souvenir shops and dining options (from McDonald's to a chinese, korean and indian restaurants) and gelaterias around the hotel. Walking distance to the Rome Opera House and Plaza Nazionale. Front desk staff helpful and friendly. Location is safe yet they still keep the front door locked from 11pm to I think 5am even if there's a night staff working in the lobby - i like the extra security detail. Breakfast is fantastic. Lots of choices and even if we were there for a week- we didn't get tired of the breakfast spread. the variety is great. The downside is the elevator is too tiny and seems slow at peak times. In the middle of the night too, you can hear the garbage trucks coming or going... And because it's Rome, they don't allow the use of A/C in the autumn so you have no choice but to open the windows if you want fresh air... that includes leaving it open and getting exposed to the sounds of city living; siren, garbage truck and the occasional drunk singing on his way back to his hotel... The double rooms are spacious enough, bathroom is a good size and housekeeping staff highly efficient though they speak little to no english. The rooms are outdated but we didn't go to Rome to enjoy the interior of a hotel. There is only one computer in the lobby with internet access and fee is a little too high so I have to walk closer to the Termini station where they have more affordable internet service. When we took the train from Termini to go to Venice, it only took us 10 minutes to walk from the hotel to the train station. Termini station is a destination itself and a good venue for people watching and have lots of dining options there too. Souvenir tip: If you want to buy chocolates or souvenirs to bring home to friends, look for a neighborhood convenient store where the locals go. The prices are way cheaper than duty free chocolates and souvenir shops close to major tourist stops. These convenience stores are usually hidden in street corners....

But I got a great summer promotion deal, directly from the hotel website. They have a lot of deals going on if you scroll down and look to the right. A single room with 2 beds at 77 euro a night, plus it was a 3 star . ($110) The staff was very friendly, the continental breakfast was adequate. Cold cerals, toast, boiled eggs, pastries, cakes, coffee/ hot chocolate machine, juice machine, yogurt, etc Matter of fact I even made a few ham cheese and crossiant sandwiches to take with me during the day. The room and bathroom was clean. Beautiful terrace upstairs. Also its So close to the termini station that we walked maybe 4 minutes. And its easy to find. Close to everything.. I only booked for 3 nights.... but after checking the hotels neighbouring this one and the outrageous prices, I asked If i could book the other three nights at the same price at the front desk. and they agreed. The A/C after a hot days walk wasnt the coldest, but was cool enough. NO IRON in the hotel at all, So iron your clothes before. Also no adapters at the front desk for usa appliances. The bathroom hair dryer appliance has a 120 plug. but double check before plugging in. Also no free wifi. . The computer station they offer downstairs is .35 cents a minute. But you can go to an internet cafe around the corner which is way cheaper. Also the only tv station in english is CNN world. Lotssss of resturants nearby - all pricey. But like i said this is Rome.

The front desk reception staff were not helpful. To start with they asked me to keep the passport at the reception and come back in half hour to collect it. As it would take them 30 minutes to complete the check-in formalities. Wonder why ? I remained at the desk and they eventually did complete the check-in in the next 10 minutes. 2. We were 3 of us including our 14 months baby. We were given a room with 2 single beds. We were provided with a child cot later. I do not expect a classic double bed room to have two single beds. The room decoration was in-adequate. 3. We were recommended an open top bus tour Ciao Roma. We were asked to pay 6 Euros to the hotel front desk and remaining 13 euros to the bus company. This tour company unlike the several others stopped far away from places of interest. Hence we had a long walk to where we wanted to go. Plus even after charging the 6 euros we had paid for the reservation we did not get a seat on the top floor of the bus. 4. The morning breakfast was just about average. No fresh juice. There was a juice machine (from a concentrate). 5. No kettle in rooms. (But I guess generally true with all hotels in Italy). 6. There was a standing shower with curtains. Water spilled out after a shower. Positive points ... 1. Near Termini train station. 2. The staff did call a Taxi whenever required. 3. They have a locker room to keep luggage after you checkout. So you do not need to take your luggage to any other left luggage facility. 4. Near a few attractions. If I visit Rome again I will not stay in this Hotel.

We came from Naples via train into termini. We walked 2 blks to this hotel easily with luggage. Front desk prompt and friendly. Elevators good and big. Our standard room was clean and neat. Decent closet space, could have used another luggage rack but we moved the bench and made it happen. Safe gave us a bit of trouble twice, but was fixed within 30 minutes. Hotel lobby, breakfast room and bar --gorgeous and clean. Breakfast was a bit weak compared to our other 2 hotels, yet yummy and fresh. Staff very attentive! Bartender treated me like Gold every night when i had my night cap. Loved the decor and walk the stairway at least once to look at the sketches. Main bonus the location. Didn't find the area scary or dangerous at all. Wouldn't walk through the little dark park by the termini though. Easily advoidable. We stayed by the forum for the 1st leg of the trip and walked everywhere. Now we got the roma pass and used the metro and buses to get to villa B and the Vatican and down to the Paramid etc. Its great because no matter how bad u mess up. Your bus will eventually come to a Metro stop and that will always take to to termini! EASY system to use, even for those who never tried mass transit. Our room overlooked the Diocletian Baths and it was a lovely site day and night. Wanted to eat in the sister hotel down the street, but the wine celler restaurant was closed and the other was way to pricey. Lots and lots of little local places in the 4 blocks west and south. Also the Opera house is 2 blks NW and there must be tons of great spots. Never got there or to see an opera--but lots of literature in the lobby for those interested. I heard its worth it if you can fit it in. Overall the hotel can be a bit loud, but we were to tired to care (again wine helps with all these little annoyances). I think its a good pick for a great price for those interested in using mass transit. Oh and they gave us a prompt wake-up call at 3:30am and we walked over to termini and got a cab to the airport easily. Cabs always there.

The hotel is near a ton of restaurants, particularly if you venture down Via Giovanni Amendola towards Via Cavour. If you walk downhill on Via Cavour, it takes you toward the Coliseum which will be on your left. Total walking time from the hotel to the Coliseum is about 20 minutes.

Hotel was ok - good value for what we paid (about 100 Euros a night), and what you would expect from a 3* hotel. Gymnasium was much better than we expected - new CV machines, and good weights for women. Not the best weights for men though - my husband laughed when he saw that 10 kilos was the heaviest! Roof top terrace bar was also a nice place to have a drink before heading out for the evening - nice view and relaxing atmosphere.

Also, the staff weren't that friendly/helpful to be honest, even though I spoke Italian to them. On the other hand, it seems that most staff in hotels/shops in Rome aren't the biggest smilers in the world! Good areas for restaurants/bars - Trastevere (need to catch linea 'H' bus from outside Termini station, takes about 20 mins); Campo di Fiori is a bit touristy but plenty of restaurants with outside seating and good atmos. One nice place to eat by the hotel is 'La Gallina Bianca' - can't remember the name of the street it's on, but it's just off Via Cavour, about 5 mins from hotel. Bar Artu in Trastevere (just off Piazza d'Egizzio) is a good place to start a night out - they serve delicious and FREE aperitivo between 1930-2130.

It does have a little roof terrace with a bar which is absoultely beautiful to sit and have wine or coffee and look over the Bascillica of Santa Maria Maggiore. The rooms were very clean and the shower cubicle was huge! The rooms were practical and comfortable. There is also a fitness gym in the hotel if you have the engery to use it. The hotel is near the termini and for a busy city centre hotel is quite quiet. Overall this was one of the best hotels I have stayed in in terms of friendly, helpful staff. They had lots of maps at reception and are happy to point things out for you or order taxis etc. I will certainly be returning to this hotel. We were originally booked into the International Palace hotel in Rome who when we arrived denied all knowledge of a booking and told us the hotel was full. We were placed in the Nord Nuova which we were told was only a 3 star superior compared to the 4 star International.

We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel, costing 75 euros. We were able to check in early (10:00 am). The hotel was in good condition and nicely decorated. The staff spoke English and provided us with a map. I recommend picking up a map during your stay as it was much more detailed than the maps we brought with us. Our room was small but very clean. The mini bar was a small refrigerator consisting of two bottles of water and two drinking glasses, leaving plenty of room to put our own snacks and drinks inside. The room was nonsmoking, but the floors are not. Therefore we constantly had cigarette smoke in our room. Surprisingly, our room was stifling hot even though the weather outside was cool. The air conditioner did not work, so we had a hot room that smelled of smoke. Opening the windows provided a great breeze, but our room was on the 1st floor and unfortunately right above a very busy and loud city street. The shower drain was clogged. We reported this but it was not fixed during our stay. A 5-minute shower risked flooding the bathroom. The bed was hard as a rock. Normally I like a firm bed, but even I was shocked by how hard it was. We could also hear other guests in their room. We could hear the telephone, conversations, using the restroom, etc. Our room was near the stairway, so we could hear the other guests coming and going. Breakfast was included in our hotel cost. It consisted of pastries, toast, hard-boiled eggs, sliced ham & cheese, frozen yogurt and cereal. The beverages consisted of juices, coffee and tea. Breakfast was served from 6 am to 10 am. Also, the hotel does not have \u201claundry facilities\u201d as I read in the description on different web site. It has a laundry/dry cleaning/pressing service. The hotel is not far from the Termini. We never took a train, but there is a grocery store there, plus other shops. The metro is also nearby and we used it for some of the tourist attractions a little too far to walk.

Eventually, the combination of time constrictions and budget, led to us buying a package deal from Expedia - plane tickets and hotel. We bought a deal that took us from London to Rome flying Alitalia and 5 nights at the Bettoja Hotel Nord Nuova Roma for 720\u00a3 (about 1300$), excluding breakfast. As usual, it was not easy to decide which hotel to choose. We did some homework and most reviews indicated that the Termini area was \u201chighly undersirable\u201d. The decision to stay in the area was influenced by price and the fact that there were renowned 4-5 star hotels in the same vicinity \u2013 how \u201cundersirable\u201d could the area really be then? On the morning of July 2nd we arrived at the Termini train station using the Leonardo express. The hotel is located in the street Giovanni Amendola so it is only a short walk from the main entrance of the train station. The reception desk area was typical for a smaller European hotel I guess: quite tiny. But the check in was pretty fast and after filling in some papers we got the key to room 544 and took the lift to our room on the 5th floor. The room looked really dark when we came in but it got much lighter when we opened the doors to a small balcony. But we didn\u2019t leave the doors open very long. It was getting quite hot even if it was early morning so it was better to keep them shut and let the air-conditioning do its job. The air-conditioning only seemed to have three settings: high, medium and low and it was a bit noisy\u2026but it was better than nothing :-) The view from the balcony was not spectacular either. The room itself was not that big but had what we needed: a double bed, a little TV on a desk with a few English channels (BBC, CNN etc) and a small safe where we could lock up our valuables. The floor was tiled and the walls had been painted in a yellowish color. This did brighten up the room as it looked somewhat gloomy with the dark furniture. The bathroom was bigger than expected and was nice and light - with light tiles and natural light coming in from a window. There was a bath (with a shower option using a shower curtain), toilet, bidet and a sink. Together with the usual soap, shampoo and shower cap. And there was also a hair dryer on the wall. Tip: If you like hot showers, let someone else shower before you! The water took a while to heat up to Nikki\u2019s liking. According to the information in the hotel it was possible to get access to wireless internet connection but I didn\u2019t bring along my laptop so I never got to try it out. There was also a gym that we never took a look at as we got enough exercise from walking all over Rome every day :-) On the roof top there is a terrace where you can sit, have a drink and enjoy the view of rooftops in Rome. Breakfast was not included in our hotel package and we didn\u2019t eat at the hotel. But there was a nice place to have breakfast on the corner of the hotel (turn left when leaving the hotel) called Nori. They had very good coffee and different sandwiches. Remember that it is cheap if you just have your coffee by the counter. But if you sit down and get the coffee served then the price is higher. I think I paid about 0.7 \u20ac for an espresso at the counter. But when we sat down we had to pay about 4.5 \u20ac for a cappuccino. Location As mentioned initially the hotel is located a few minutes from the Termini station. This was handy when arriving from the airport and when leaving again :-) It was also handy for getting around Rome. There is a bus station in front of the Termini and we used busses no. 40 and 64 all the time to get around. There is also a metro station at the Termini that can be used but we didn\u2019t really use it that much as the Rome guidebook didn\u2019t have a proper subway map. The Termini area is not that far from the main attractions in Rome. If you walk down Via Cavour I think it only takes about 15 minutes to get to the street where you see Coliseum, Forum etc. There were restaurants in the area around the hotel but we normally ate in places around Piazza Navona. Conclusion We had a nice stay at this 3 star hotel and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate recommending it to others. But as in New York we got just what we expected: a small room where we could spend the night and get a shower after walking around in the heat of Rome all day.", "Date": "August 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ridgewood, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly surprised by this small pretty hotel\u201d", "Author": "nangela", "ReviewID": "UR3741613", "Content": "We booked this hotel, very close to the Termini Train station, for our last night stopover in Rome before flying back to New York.

My girlfriend and I stayed at the hotel the evenings of 3-5 and 9-10 July 2005. The first room (3-5 July) was nominally a \"double\", but was actually two twin mattresses pushed together on the same frame. The rates were 105, 115, and 135 euro for Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday nights. We initially had a problem with this room because it had two separate twin beds; because we had already occupied the room before we complained they wouldn't change the bed until the next day. So on Monday we kept the same room but they mounted the two mattresses on one frame. I don't know if this is typical of other \"double\" rooms in the hotel. In addition to the bed(s) the room had a nightstand, a table with small (old-looking) color TV, a comfortable chair, a large wall-mounted mirror above the table, and a closet (I believe with a chest of drawers inside). There was a small safe in the closet but it didn't come with instructions. The decor seemed plain but nice. The bathroom had a small window and a sink, toilet, and bidet, as well as a bathtub with a wall-mounted showerhead (the shower curtain only encircled half the bathtub). The room was on the side of the hotel and overlooked a small street/alley that had some restaurants (Chinese and other) on it. The room had air conditioning, which was nice (it wasn't too strong but maybe we didn't set it high enough). The second room (9-10 July) was a true double with one large bed; the rate was 105 euro per night for Saturday and Sunday nights. The decor was nicer -- the wood looked fancier, for example. The main differences were that there was no closet although there was a large dresser for clothes (with a safe inside, this time with instructions) and the shower was different: it was a stand-up shower with doors and a detachable hand-held showerhead. It was big enough for two people but just barely. This room had the feature that to enable the lights in the room you had to insert a special key (included with the room key) in a socket near the door. I think this room was more modern that the first room. It also was a smoking room, but that actually was fine once we aired out the room for a while with an open window. (They told us later that the hotel only had six non-smoking rooms and none of them were true doubles; our first room might have been non-smoking.) This room was at the front of the hotel and overlooked a slightly larger and busier street, but the noise wasn't too bad even when the window was open. The air conditioning seemed stronger in this room, but maybe we just set it higher. Interestingly, the doorknob to this room was on the right side of the door and unlocked by turning the key counterclockwise, whereas in the first room the doorknob was on the left and unlocked by turning the key clockwise. The hotel is quite close to the Termini train station (we took the EuroStar high-speed train to Florence from there). The hotel is particularly near the end of the station that houses the bus terminals and the Termini Metro station. It's probably a five minute walk or so. The Repubblica Metro station is about the same distance but the Termini Metro is nice since both Metro lines intersect there. (By the way, if you want to take the bus, you can buy a ticket at the machines at the bus terminals (or any other major bus stop). If you want to get a 75-minute ticket, for example, press the appropriate button on the machine and insert your 1 euro coin and after some time it will print a ticket and drop it into the bin below. When you get on the bus validate the ticket by inserting it arrow-forward and face-down into the yellow machine, where it will print a time stamp. No one actually checked our tickets during any of our rides, however. The exact same tickets can be used for the Metro: just validate them before passing the turnstile.) From the Termini station we took the 40 Express to the Vatican which ends near Castel Sant'Angelo and St. Peter's Square, and we took the 910 to Villa Borghese and the Borghese Gallery. I didn't time the walk to the Rome city center (we were stopping to do sightseeing along the way), but I imagine it's not more than a half-hour walk to most of the historical sites in the center. We didn't seem to find any really good restaurants near the hotel, but our search was rather casual. Apparently the hotel has a patio up on the 7th floor with a bar (open from something like 4 PM to 12:20 AM), but we didn't go up there. There was a computer terminal with high-speed internet access for which the rate was 0.35 euro per minute with a minimum charge of 5.25 euro. There are better rates to be had out Rome's various internet cafes (we eventually found one a 15 minute walk away which charged something like 2 euro for 45 minutes). The hotel also had ads stating that the hotel was set up for wireless internet, but I didn't bring my computer with me and don't know what the rates are. I tried using an international calling card from the hotel to place a call to the United States, but the call to the 1-800 number listed on the card wouldn't go through. I ended up going through an international operator and charging it to my credit card: big mistake. The cost was US$50 for a short phone call -- approximately $10 per minute! We didn't have too much interaction with the staff, but they seemed pleasant (aside from the initial confrontation over the beds in the first room). The desk staff is pretty English-friendly, as is the case in most locations of Rome frequented by tourists. To check into the hotel you'll need to present the passports of everyone staying in the room (this may be due to regulations about foreign visitors registering with the local police) and you give your credit card when you check out. The concierge on our first visit was helpful in suggesting bus lines to get to various locations within the city. The hotel has a breakfast buffet (ends at 10:30 AM; not sure when it starts) which is pretty nice. They have a selection of rolls, croissants, slices of ham and cheese for sandwiches, some packets of butter and jellies, and cereal bins. They have machines that dispense fruit juices (blood orange, grapefruit, and pineapple) and water, and they serve coffee and tea. Overall, except for some glitches I found the hotel to be comfortable and conveniently accessible to a wide range of public transportation.
