The breakfast buffet (which we had as part of our room fee) was excellent: many cold and hot food choices including a wide variety of pastries and breads, yogurt, meat, cheese, tortilla Espanol as well as beverages and coffee/tea. The location is fantastic-close to the Prado as well as the Reina Sofia and the Thyssen museums. The Puerto del Sol and Plaza Mayor are an easy (uphill) ten minute walk. There are many interesting small shops, restaurants and markets in the neighborhood. I recommend the hotel and plan on staying there the next time we travel to Madrid ( which hopefully will be soon as it is a great city to visit) One more thing, the bathroom was comfortably sized and had an amenity kit in addition to the soap/shampoo/lotion that we had expected.

I imagine they spend a fortune in heating, and give instructions to every employee to spare energy. The breakfast room was always cold. The lady in charge complained every morning.

The service has been impecable and cheerful but especially so when I returned late Saturday night in a total panic because someone had lifted my wallet with passport, all money and credit cards. The desk person on duty helped me calm down and directed me to the nearest police station to file a report, she loaned me 10 euros out of her personal money so I could get something to eat until I could get money wired from the US. When I got back from the police station she helped me phone the US embassy.

I like my hotels on quiet side streets, which this hotel is, and it was not the hotel's fault that a huge demonstration against the government went on the entire time we were there at the Bureau of Sanitation which was across the street, but it made for a less than quiet experience.

The twin room faced the street (and noise), but we were told there were no other choices. As non-smokers (I am asthmatic), we appreciated that there was not much smoke smell in common areas or shared ventilation. The desk help from the female staff was superb! They were gracious, went out of their way to make reservations and go through map routes with us, but the men were not warm, and not very helpful. The bellman was wonderful as was the breakfast girl who worked her bottom off! We tipped them daily. The bathroom was large and clean, but the tub was narrow and very slippery. We suggest a towel on the floor of the tub when showering. On my European Hard Hotel Bed Scale (1 cement to 5 comfy), the beds were a 3. A Caveat to Non-Smokers: One thing we didn't know before we got to Madrid was that it is a city behind in respect for people who don't smoke or have health issues. Ninety-five percent of the restaurants allow smoking in the majority of the place, with small areas called \"Non-Smoking\" that are not separated by any barrier, or if in a separate room, have an open door and smoke fills any non-smoking area. We found two restaurants through the concierge that are non-smoking (our tour guide to Toledo recommended one), but they were VERY pricey.

My room was a double and was ample size for two adults. The shower was comfortable and the bathroom bigger than European standards. I heard no street noise and no neighbor noise at all. My only complaint was how expensive the breakfast buffet was -- 12 euros. I stayed in two other hotels in Spain with buffets and they were half the price. I only wanted juice, cereal and a roll, yet had to pay full price as if I was eating the omelette, meat, fruit, etc. All in all this is a great choice for business and vacation travelers.
