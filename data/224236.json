{"Reviews": [{"Content": "They Stole My Money Well, I was in a southern city to work on a contract computer programming job. I checked in, and found the hotel to be in a nice location, clean, and a nice value.One day a few weeks later, I was doing laundry. I found a broken dryer (it kept my money) so I wrote broken, don't use (please refund $1.50 to room xxx) on it with a dry-erase marker. Anyone who knows these markers knows it is SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to wipe right off.Next day, I went to work. Got no call or message from management. I presumed they credited my account for the $1.50.At TEN PM, the manager came to my door with a thug for backup, acting very aggressivly and complaining about graffiti and told me I am evicted. Mind you, I had just paid for an additional week of rent! The manager did not telephone me, or even talk to me earlier, which she could easily have done if there was a problem. She specifically chose 10pm to do this in order to give me the MAXIMUM inconvenience! She proceeded to tell me I had 20 minutes after which they would throw my stuff off the balcony. I replied Why even say that, you would not want to damage my stuff and get into a lawsuit? She got real mad that I called her bluff.I got dressed, and began to pack. She stood in the doorway, partially blocking it. As I came by with a box, she screamed you touched me,that is assault, you cannot go back in! This was obviously a well-practiced technique, designed to make sure I can not go back into my room to get my property. The thug blocked the doorway, and they told me they would throw my stuff onto the hallway, and I can get it from there. I shrugged, and continued to put a box of my stuff in my car. I noticed that the thug had a set of bolt cutters. I realized later that this was because they PLANNED to do this, and brought the bolt cutters in order to cut the security cable on my laptop computer, again, to give me maximum inconvenience and cost, instead of just asking me to unlock it.After the police came, I asked them to accompany me to the room, because I sensed that some property seemed to be missing. The manager screamed He has it all, we put it all out! I replied that I would like to look to be sure. Lucky thing I did, because the policeman and I found all my tools, some of my clothes, and computer equipment still in the closet.Later I heard the policeman telling the manager words to the effect of You cannot keep evicting people in the middle of the night right after taking their money, it will cause problems. If you dont want them to stay, simply refuse to take their payment and notify them in the daytime that they have to leave. Don't take their money, and then come to evict them in the middle of the night Apparently, this is their pattern of practice.So here it is, midnight, I just paid one week rent the day before, ($190) had a deposit ($50), and a broken security cable ($40). Also, I have to find a hotel room ($80) at midnight, reorganize my stuff (the made a mess of everything) and try to get some sleep before work.I went to the intownsuites.com website to look for the corporate office address.... IT ISNT LISTED! Also... no telephone number! NO Email addresses!I used their puny web form to write a note, and got one single response by email... they asked for my phone number so they could call and discuss it with me. Of course, they NEVER called, and NEVER answered any more emails.Their whole system seems to be arranged to take advantage of people. I would SERIOUSLY avoid this company. Stick with the major chains of suite hotels, and long-term hotels.", "Date": "Jun 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR873620154", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "talldarkhandsome30"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d224236-r7900352-InTown_Suites_Forest_Lane-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "224236", "Price": "$171"}}
