After these hours, take the public transport 451 to/from Ponte Mammolo metro station. One one occasion we got bumped off the shuttle by the driver as he wanted to accomodate somebody else (guess why??). Not wanting to create a scene on the shuttle and delaying other perople we got off and took up the matter with the receptionist (Emmanuella??) and the hotel manageress who promised to investigate with the driver (not George but the other one). No explanations to date forcing me to surmise their cowardly behaviour! 2. As for the hotel, the rooms were ok - airconditioner hardly having any effect. The cleaners never did a completely satisfactory job. Either they forgot to replace to tea tray or never vaccumed the carpet or omitted to do the bed altogether. We had to get these complaints rectifed via the reception. On 3 occassions the locks refused to open up on swiping the card and once we had to change the room becasue they could not programme the key due to a broken down machine. The mattresses need replacement as most perople we spoke with complained of back aches when we met up in the breakfast area. 3. The reception staff tried to be as helpful as they could especially Daniel went out of the way to make us comfortable. 4. The supermaket and the cafeteria behind the hotel was a boon as we could not find restaurants nearby.

The hotel is actually located outside Rome at about 2 kms from the nearest metro station (Ponte Mamolo). The metro takes you to Rome Termini (central) in 15 mns and I do not consider this as a problem. The only problem is that you need to take the shuttle to go to the metro station. The shuttle is a courtesy of the hotel and the trip is less than 5 minutes but DO NOT expect to walk to the metro as you need to cross highways and we haven't seen walkways. Also the shuttle departs from the hotel and back every 30 mns from 7h30 to 11h00 and then from 17h00 to 22h00. A taxi from downtown would cost around 20-30 Euros.

Contrary to all the published reports, driving in Rome was no worse (maybe even easier) than driving in downtown Boston, Massachusetts, USA. The hotel has a shuttle that runs every 30 minutes or so to the train station. From there, you take a train to the Metro. We did not find this mode of travel convenient, plus strikes by public transport workers are common and unpredictable. There is nothing in the area of the hotel in which to see. No restaurants or sites. It is a residential area, but if you want to save money and can get yourself into Rome, stay here. Since we rented a car, we did not buy the 11 euro pass for the buses and metro. We were very pleased with our situation. We were glad to have a car as there were several strikes by public transportation workers. On the first day, the taxi drivers were striking, onthe third day all of the public transportation was shut down for the day (taxi, bus, metro). It took us about 40 minutes to get into Rome and find parking on the first day. Thereafter, it was about 25-30 minutes. The parking was within walking distance of most major sites, except the vatican.

If you are thinking of booking it my advice would be not to bother. It is really in the middle of nowhere apart from a supermarket nearby(the only redeming feature). There are no other hotels or restaurants(apart from a wee pizza takeaway). No bars either and the hotel bar closes about 11pm! And don't expect them to have any change for the vending machine! There was a lot of derelict land with graffiti everywhere. There is a shuttle bus but it only takes you to a local subway station at certain times of the day. Some of the staff tried to help(and they are certainly not bilingual as claimed) others had no interest in helping. The sky tv is in Italian. The hotel seemed clean enough, but not nearly as nice as the Holiday Expresses we have stayed in in Scotland though.

And yes it does have good facilities for the money, the room was a good size with decent air conditioning and a nice early check in time. As all the other reviews show the hotel is quite a long way from the city centre. It does have good connections to the city centre. To get to the hotel you need to take metro line B (blue line) to Ponte Mammolo and then go down the escalator and go outside to the left. The hotel shuttle goes from right outside this exit of the metro station but does not run between 11am and 6pm. There is a local bus, the 451 that goes from outside the station too and this runs very frequently until midnight. Be aware you need to push and shove your way onto all buses and metros as that is what everyone in italy does and being polite gets you nowhere. You need to stay on this bus for 6 stops, it is a very busy bus so you can notice 6 stops easily, if not when you see the circus looking tent on your right or the hotel itself on your right press the button to stop the bus. The hotel does seem to be very near to a lot of prostitutes who do not bother you at all but do seem to be around from mid afternoon and go into the fields which are not very concealed! we saw more than we wanted to see! To use the metro and the buses you get a ticket from the metro stations, this ticket is valid for both trains and buses but you need to validate the ticket in one of the stamping machines at the entrance to the metro or on the bus as if you do not have one or have not validated it you can get a large fine. Once you have validated it then you can just walk on and off the trains with ease. Overall the hotel is a nice hotel for the money but if i went again i would pay that bit more and stay more central as we struggled to get home at night as the metro stops at about 11pm. A taxi to the hotel from the centre cost us about 25 euros so its a bit expensive to do every night.", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cDecent clean hotel, good value for money\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4937551", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and were very happy with everything. I would only recommend it. There is a small shuttle bus, lets say for 18 people, which runs every 30 minutes from the hotel to the nearest underground station called Ponte Mammolo, which is on the line B. Once you get on the underground or Metro as the italians call it, you get anywhere you like, so for someone with commom sense it is very easy to get anywhere. The ticket for the train journey cost 1Euro and you get 75 minutes in which you can change as many times as you want. If you want to travel all day using the underground then is better to purchase the ticket for 4Euros and that's valid till midnight and you can use the same ticket on any bus, so that was great too. The hotel bus does not run between 11.00 am till 6.00pm assuming that people are seesighting and only be coming back at around 6.00pm which is fine. If you miss the shuttle bus, there is a local bus number 451 just outside the underground station which will take u near the hotel and you can use the ticket you used all day on the Metro. Rooms were spotless, bathrooms same, no kettle though in the room, but we had a small travel kettle to make our tea or coffee. Every morning from 7,30 till about 11 the breakfast was served downstairs, buffet style and the choice was great, you had croissants, pastries, jams, fresh bread, baguettes, scrambled eggs, cereals, yoghurts, selection of freshly squeezed juices and coffees. If you needed anything else to eat, there is a large supermarked just behind the hotel called Auchan . After the Auchan you will get to the street with some restaurants and small shops too. The weather was excellent considering it was beginning of April, we could not ask for better. Staff was very nice too, they understood english and gave us maps and directions when we asked, they even allowed us to leave our luggage at the reception after we checked out at 12.00 noon, because our flight was later on that evening and we did not want to drag the suitcases with us, while going to Rome for couple of more hours. You don't have to take the taxi for 45 Euros from the CIAMPINO airport, there is cheaper way - just take the bus from outside the Ciampino to Anagnina underground station and then get from there to Ponte Mammolo station and from there either the free hotel bus or the normal 451 bus mentioned above and you will save so much money.", "Date": "April 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cLarge, clean rooms and good breakfast.

Neutral aspects: Some staff helpful/others uninterested in giving \"detailed\" information when asked, that would have been helpful and saved us time and energy; breakfast room gets pretty crowded and tv is loud. The negative: LOCATION It is quite a ride from Rome center, and between metro stops and changes and catching the bus to the hotel, one can expect it to take around 40min... Unless of course,if you miss your bus stop and get out on the next one (hotel said 6th stop but that doesn't mention possibility of people ringing for unscheduled stops)than it could take longer. It is only a 10min walk to hotel from bus stop but that was passed quite a few prostitutes even in the middle of the day;So I suppose it goes without saying that the area is pretty \"seedy\". last negative: no screens in room so mosquitos can make an appearance. If you decide to book hotel, here are some helpful hints: There is no air condition but windows do open (unlike most hotel windows in States).There is a laundromat (Fonda Blu) about 15min walk that has reasonable prices and you can just leave laundry and pick up--they wash and fold--or self serve. If you take bus from metro, it's really difficult to count 6 stops if people ring for extra stops, and it's possible to miss hotel, it's wise to ask bus driver to let you know \"Hotel Express Holiday Inn\".The bus stop closest to hotel has a little bench and covering. We also double checked with people on bus who were helpful. Oh yes, shuttle runs approx. 7am-11am and then again in evening so be aware there's no shuttle service between those hours.

The hotel accomodations were basically clean. My only real problem with cleanliness were some \"questionable\" stains on the bedspread on our second stay. The bathrooms were well kept. The breakfast buffet had something everyone could enjoy, but when you're there for a while it does get dull and predictable. In the breakfast area, there is a big-screen tv, which the staff likes to keep turned up way too loud on an MTV-type station. This hotel is in the suburbs of Rome. The hotel-sponsored tour provider is happy to pick you up to take you to the tour terminal downtown, but will not bring you back to this hotel, like they will for tour-takers they pick up closer to the city center. What a surprise and inconvenience this was! You either need to return (and pay additional) on the metro, or find a taxi (and pay a lot more additional) that will bring you back. It was difficult finding taxi drivers in the downtown area that either knew where this hotel was or if they did, would agree to take you there. We found a nice, little restaurant close to the hotel to have dinner. The Auchen store (Italian Wal-Mart, as we called it) right next to the hotel was convenient.
