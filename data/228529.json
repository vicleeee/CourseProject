I booked this hotel in a 30% off sale as we ended up saving a lot of money. The reviews were quite worrying and I was quite nervous about staying at the hotel. When we arrived, the receptionist was very friendly and checked us in very quickly. He told us that we had been upgraded to a bigger room as we were staying for a long time (10 days). So that was a nice surprise! The room was very large and spacious with plenty of room to walk around. The bathroom was also a good size, with a bath/shower, toilet and bidet. The room was clean and the cleaner came in daily when we were out to make the bed and change the towels. The air conditioning worked great and was actually a bit too cold! But we didn't mind, we just would turn off for a little while and let the room warm up. Unfortunately, we didn't eat at the hotel at any time because our room didn't include breakfast. The staff were pleasant and the receptionist organised our transfer to the airport within minutes and it was only 35 euros. I saw that some people said the hotel was 'old and needed updating', whereas I totally disagree! The lobby was newly decorated with marble flooring and the sitting area had old fashioned style seats and sofas in purple and green - I felt like I was in Mad Men or some other TV show based in the 50s/60s. The lifts were a bit old and creaky but it just added character to the hotel. Really great experience and I would definitely recommend. Also, the hotel was around a 10 minute walk from Puerta del Sol, a 4 minute walk from Gran Via, a 2 minute walk from the Royal Palace. The tapas bar across the street called delGreco was nice for a drink and the chicken wings were fab! There was also a place on the way to Gran Via, about a couple of minutes away, called Nemrut which did the best kebabs ever!", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wexford, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Break in Madrid\u201d", "Author": "Maywex", "ReviewID": "UR138707614", "Content": "We had a great stay in the Tryp Ambassador.

WIFI comes in blocks of 48 hours, you can renew it as much as you like. Our room was massive, the bed and pillows were really comfortable. Everything was very clean. The bathroom was typically Spanish and a lively shade of orange! It was a stark contrast to the contemporary room, but we holiday in remote parts of Spain so weren't fazed by it. The bar area is pleasant, with a resident parrot, and the barman who served us was very friendly and spoke excellent English. The breakfast selection was huge and seemed to cater for all.

We were given a non-smoking standard room that did not have wifi (advertised for free) a clock, iron, or hot beverage setup. The room, elevator and corridors to the room were very tired and in need of refurbishment. In addition, this room was smaller then all of the rooms we experienced on a recent trip to Japan.

The decor was quite dated, especially the salmon pink bathroom suite but it was clean and very comfortable. There was enough space to entertain asa there were two couches, two easy chairs, dining table and chairs and desk. We were able to get Wi Fi. The negatives were no tea / coffee making facilities ( offered in other rooms I think ); old style small TV sets; and a door lock which usually jammed and needed a lot of fiddling about with to get opened.

The breakfast was excellent with a huge range of items on the buffet, including cava.

The hotel occupies the former residence (palace may be too grand a word) of the Dukes of Granada, and is located in \"Royal Madrid,\" about a 5-minute walk from the very grand Royal Palace. It is also about a 5-minute walk, all uphill, to the Grand Via. It is within walking distance of the Plaza Mayor, the Plaza del Sol, and many of the historic sites of central Madrid. The nearest subway stops are either a 2-minute walk uphill or a 3-minute walk downhill. Even though we had a standard room (the smallest size they have), it was larger than our rooms at either of the other 4-star hotels we stayed at in Spain. It was a pleasant size, with hardwood floors and an all-marble bath with all amenities. The heating system was very efficient, and the room was so well insulated that the heat rarely needed to come back on during the night, even though the weather was uncommonly cold for early March. The other classes of rooms in the hotel are larger, and are in fact rather large in comparison to those of most other 4-star hotels in Spain. Breakfast in a rather grand affair in a large room with crystal chandeliers, with waiters in sharp uniforms. Although rather costly (sometimes less if chosen when you book your room), it was very extensive and very good. There are ample hot choices of meats and eggs, excellent fresh pastries, and a very large assortment of fresh fruits and juices, along with cheeses and other items. If you enjoy a large breakfast to start the day, you will be pleased with this one. While the room and the breakfast were just fine, what I really appreciated about this hotel were its public spaces. These consist of a fairly large \"living room\" in a converted courtyard with a glass roof, a separate pleasant-sized bar area, and a separate restaurant, also with a glass roof, where we enjoyed a good meal. (Warning: hotel prices.) The night we dined there, a large green parrot enjoyed the goings on and occasionally commented from a corner perch well above us. The hotel staff were pleasant and capable, and helped us sort out the one or two problems we encountered. They also recommended a restaurant, Cafe Central (1870), which had arguably the best jazz I've ever heard--and I'm not young. Madrid has a plethora of good hotels, but I felt this was a good value for what I paid--94 euros per night (US $129), including tax and the two grand breakfasts. Without breakfast, we would have paid only 70 euros ($96). Larger rooms cost more, but our \"basic\" room was just fine.

Grateful though we were to drop into a comfortable bed it wasn't until the following morning that we fully appraised our inadequate room. My husband had notified the hotel reception 3 months in advance of our visit saying \"\"I have just made a reservation, Booking Reference 0900883974, for 5 nights from 16th-21st December 2009 on your 'Super Sale Europe' offer.

Yes, I realise we were only going to sleep and bathe in the room but besides its size it was also in need of refurbishment and was very certainly not up to the standard of the hotel's current 4-star rating. In room 345 we experienced tatty damaged wallpaper, a dirty and misaligned 4' x 3' ceiling vent, pinched walking point between the refrigerator and the end of the bed, an enormously heavy security type door without a closer which banged noisily when pulled to as did all the other room doors along the corridor. The hotel's really only saving grace was in fact it's position, central and very near a lot of the major sights, but then this we knew when we booked and it was in fact for this reason we chose it from the other Madrid \"Sol Melia\" hotels available, that plus its nice public rooms.

The dark orange bathroom suite added to the dated appearance of the hotel, though it's good to have the choice of a bath or shower. The ventilation system didn't clear the steam very effectively. Our visit took place during the low season and it seemed as if the whole of Madrid was undergoing a facelift with roadworks and repairs in many plazas and pavements. Some work started early on the last morning of our stay. That said, the side road location meant that, traffic noise was minimal. The most disturbing noises were from the heavy room doors accidentally slamming shut, or 'musak' coming from a speaker in the ceiling. It took us some time to find the control for switching it off. (On the wall by the bed!) Our board basis was room only, but there are a wealth of places to have breakfast, including San Gines - a 5 minute walk away- for hot chocolate and churros. A must for an evening meal would be Casa Patas; enjoy the flamenco show afterwards. Only a minute's walk away is Cafe de la Opera for dinner and talented singing waiters. The hotel is a 2 minute walk from Santo Domingo metro. It's a 2 line change from the airport and about an hour's travelling time. Purchase a 10 journey ticket, remember the airport supplement. Our group of 4 shared the ticket, just pass it back to each other at the ticket barrier. You can keep a note of how many journeys are left with the 'counter' displayed at the barrier.

On our return to our room we found that someone had been in the room (on the 5th floor) and stolen money from my girlfriends handbag. We immediatley reported this to the manager who didnt seem to take us particularly seriously and noone even came up to our room to see what had happened. We spoke at length with the manager down in reception but he seemed unwilling to accept that there was a security issue in his hotel and someone, either a member of staff or someone from outside, had been in our room and stolen stuff.

Most of the comments are dead on. Here are some of my comments to add: CAB FARE to hotel (from MAD airport): For us, I think it was \u20ac 35 [because of the additional person (I think) and a tarrif]. I did not leave a tip. Also, when we left our hotel (going back to the airport) at 7 am on a weekday, it cost \u20ac24. Whatever. That driver really helped us with our bags, so I tipped \u20ac 1. He seemed really appreciative of it though! Generally, I was advised NO TIP NEEDED for taxi drivers. LOCATION: Wonderful! It\u2019s 2 short blocks to the metro (Opera station, Green Line). It\u2019s also a 5-10 minute walk (depending on how fast you walk) to the Palacio Real (the Royal Palace). It\u2019s also a 10 minute walk to the Plaza Mayor (a \u201cmust-see\u201d on anyone\u2019s Top Ten list of things to do!). STAFF: Very helpful. All speak English. Fluently. No worries there! Particular mentions go to Miguel (works days), Manuel (works nights), and Todor (youngish, works nights). They gave terrific advice and recommendations! ELEVATOR: Very small. It reminded me of my pantry closet for my linens (at home). Really small. They have a \u201c0\u201d floor (usually ground level). We were on the 3 rd floor, but when we tried to walk down, we could never get to floor Zero. So we had to use the elevator every time. Oh well so much for conserving energy. ROOM: Um\u2026 small. It made me feel like I was renting a studio apt in NYC rather than being in a hotel. But it was fine for its purpose. Always clean, well kept, but also small on the closet/storage. I liked that the hotel safe had shelving and was VERY EASY to use. Their were signs in the elevator for upgrades to a Junior or Master suite, but unless you were more than two people, I don\u2019t feel it was necessary (or worth it). TELEVISION: Unless you speak Spanish or German (didn\u2019t get that one! Is there a significant German population??), you are going to hate the tv here. Only CNN and FoxNews. Bring a dvd player or laptop and upload (or bring) a few movies to watch. ADAPTER PLUGS: Prepare to bring your own. This hotel does not supply any! If you cannot find it at a local electronic store, you can order these online if you are not leaving for your trip for at least a week (to account for delivery time). I emailed them a week before my trip, so I already knew this about them. ROOM DOOR: (Silly, but we needed help!) Put your key in the lock, turn the key to the right (leave the key there!), THEN (and only then) turn the doorknob to the RIGHT. Voila! Door opens. Insert your \u201cstick\u201d end of the key into the slot\u2026 otherwise, no electricity for you! (Strangely, the tv still works, but no lights.) INTERNET: If you have a laptop, do not pay for internet service! There is free (FREE!) wireless service in the hotel \u201ccourt\u201d/foyer area, off the lobby. (The same room with the couches and the arched glass ceiling.) We tried many times, but we could not get an internet connection in our hotel room. If you didn\u2019t bring a computer with you, the hotel\u2019s internet service (we thought) is very expensive. You are better off going to any of the internet cafes throughout the city. Many of them serve food (or coffee, at the very least) so you can kind of kill two birds with one stone there. GYM/ATHLETIC FACILITY: There was none in the hotel. I didn\u2019t bother to ask whether the hotel had any complimentary guest passes anywhere. No matter \u2013 we did plenty of walking to make up for that! BREAKFAST: Okay\u2026 our travel agent pushed the breakfast on us. Breakfast was (in a word) SPECTACULAR. In hindsight, I think I would have tried to use a discount website and book the hotel MYSELF without breakfast. Oh, the buffet breakfast was WONDERFUL (more in a minute), but we felt obligated to overeat since we paid for it you know. I think you could do fine going off the beaten path elsewhere, and getting a croissant or pastry with coffee. By the way, the Spainiards LOVE LOVE LOVE their desserts (postres) with ANY MEAL: STARTING WITH BREAKFAST!! Assortment of anything for everyone, incl those with allergies. They love their pastries (so I\u2019m skipping this), but they also love their meats & sausage & eggs! \u201cSalad\u201d bar style spread of stuff: baked beans, 2 types of sausages, various platters of cut fruit, whole fruit (apples, oranges, etc), champagne (it\u2019s actually cava), 2-3 types of fruit juices, 2 types of water (gas/regular), ice (there is a CHARGE if you want this in your hotel room!!), cereals (we didn\u2019t have any, but it looked like 2-3 different types), coffee/tea, cucumbers, corn, chopped tomatoes, dry nuts, smoked salmon (sometimes), various cheeses, salami, chorizo, ham, and a few other things that (b/c my Spanish was so poor) I didn\u2019t know what they were. Oh, it\u2019s not that I couldn\u2019t ask, but my dictionary was so bad that when they answered, I\u2019d still have no clue what that was. METRO (subway system): Very easy to use. Very clean. Quite safe. If you are there for 3 days or more, highly recommend the 10-trip bonos (bonus) for \u20ac 6,90. The only downside is the 10-trip card is per person; two people cannot use the same card. Otherwise, each one-way ride is \u20ac 1,15. We each used ours 7 or 8 times (we didn\u2019t even finish it) and the bonos still saved us money! Two restaurants within walking distance worth mentioning- SOBRE DE BOUTIN: (near Plaza Major) You will need a reservation. The hotel will do it for you, just ask at the front desk! Ernest Hemmingway mentioned this restaurant in his book. AND, more importantly, it is the oldest restaurant in the world. No kidding! Yes, of course it's tourist-y, but you pay for charm, atmosphere and amazing, falls of the bone, yet crispy-skin roast meats. Their specialty is the roast suckling pig and roast lamb. We got one of each, but in hindsight, we'd get 2 orders of the cochinillo. TRES ENCINAS: OMG\u2026 excellent seafood paella! Not cheap but well worth what you pay for! We split the seafood croquettes (8 pieces), and the paella for two, each enjoyed a glass of house wine and the bill was around \u20ac 80 (yes, I tipped about \u20ac 2 \u2013 see my section about Tipping below). GENERAL TIP on RESTAURANTS: bread & butter is additional in Europe. I know, I know, but that\u2019s what it is. If you don\u2019t want the additional charge, you MUST SAY SO when you order (\u201cno pan\u201d or \u201csin pan\u201d will suffice), or REFUSE IT if they bring it to your table before you even order. Also, they push the bottled water but we read that the drinking water in Madrid is perfectly fine. If you want tap water (I come from NYC, so I enjoy good tap water!), ask for \u201cagua de grifo\u201d. They will look at you funny, but you will get cold water, usually in a pretty glass pitcher, and usually with ice! SPECIFIC DAYS to know about: SUNDAYS: Bullfighting. Generally, it\u2019s all year around except for the 2-3 cold winter months (December \u2013 Feb?). I think it\u2019s either at 5 pm or 7 pm. Ask the front desk if you want to know. MONDAYS: Most (if not all) museums are closed on Monday. Many restaurants are closed on Monday as well. Call ahead (or ask the front desk to call for you) to be sure. WEDNESDAYS: Do not quote me (since we weren\u2019t here on Wed) but I think the Changing of the Guard is done at the palace (Palacio Real) on this day. Again, ask the front desk. TIPPING: At self-service places (buffets, etc), zero tip. Easy enough! If you are unsure, carefully observe other people who leave. Do they leave money/change? Do they leave their tray/used plateware? You do the same! I generally left 1 or 2 euros. Examples? Two drinks at a hotel bar costing between \u20ac 9-12: 1 euro. A tapas lunch for 1 people costing around \u20ac 20-25: 1 euro. If more (like a \u20ac 55+ dinner): \u20ac 2. One dinner we did (by accident) was an outrageous dinner (excellent quality, make no mistake about my complaining!) costing \u20ac 98 for 2 people: 3 euros. People seemed appreciative enough, so I\u2019m not sure if I tipped correctly, or if that was sarcasm on their part. Do not tip the taxi dude. If you tip him, do so if he helps you with your bags and maybe \u20ac,50 or \u20ac 1,00 tops! BEFORE YOU GO: Helpful to bring a small Spanish dictionary or any of the gamut of little books put out by any of the travel or language people. This is ESPECIALLY important if, like us, you enjoy going off the beaten path. Most people in the working world do not speak very much English other than \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d or \u201cSorry\u201d. I am not making any statements or putting any culture down; it is based on my own travel observation & experience. It was very humbling to conjure up my high school Spanish irregular verbs\u2026 but I think the majority of people seem appreciative if you genuinely try! If you have any allergies, I would specifically learn that word (for your allergic item) so you can ask the waiter whether that dish includes it (\u201ceste plato incluye ___?\u201d). Better to know for sure than to spend your vacation at a Farmacia or worse (El hospital). Bring all medications you need for your trip in a ziplock bag. I prepared 8 days\u2019 worth, each day in a snack sized bag, for convenience (since some of my vitamins look identical). Be sure to include pamprin/midol (GOOD LUCK explaining THAT to a pharmacist!), Citrucel (or fiber/stool pills), and even basic aspirin/motrin/advil or painkiller. Also, call up your credit card companies. Two reasons for this: first, you will find out what the fee is per transaction (yes, it was a surprise to me but using your charge card outside the US, the credit card companies tack on an additional fee to your purchase price!). VISA/MC is usually 1%, whereas AmEx is 2%. But you will want to confirm with them. Secondly, you want to tell them that you will be in Spain/Europe. The last thing you want to do is to be in a posh store and your credit card company thinks you aren\u2019t you (fraud alert), and you have to provide the store additional identification [we almost never took our passports with us (we were mugged in Rome 3 years ago \u2013 learned our mistake then! Lovely US Embassy in Rome!!), except on travel days]. Spare yourself the hassle. REGRETS: We were here for (almost) 4 full days. If we had gotten better situated, I think I would have liked to have done the day trip to TOLEDO. Alas, we did not! BEST ADVICE I LEARNED BY ACCIDENT: Chat up your airlines steward(ess) during your flight. While I was waiting to use the bathroom, I decided to ask them a few questions. They have all been to Madrid (many times) and can give you advice and helpful tips (length of you hotel ride, metro, etc). They told me the advice I gave you (above) about tipping! Also, if your hotel is part of a chain like this hotel (sol melia), you can email them in advance of any questions/concerns you may have. They will respond well within 24 hours! You should DEFINITELY sign up for their frequent flyer-type program. They\u2019re usually free and the perks are great! I would stay here again. The location was great. But this time, I would forgo the travel agent and try to get a hotel rate online.

Even with the quirks I will describe below, overall it was generally positive experience. Planning to stay 6 nights, I opted to reserve a superior room, thinking it would give me more space and a nice view. While the first room they gave me was spacious, it was layed out in a bizarre irregular shape and had only one window facing a small light well. The second room was also spacious, but also layed out oddly, with a tiny room for the large bed and a large living space. It had a balcony, but that would be little use in the cold dreary month of January. I'm not usually picky about rooms for a short stay, but I asked for a room facing the street and got a slightly smaller but brighter room facing the street. This last room had the unfortunately typical two small beds pressed up against each other, but faced the street and had better light. (Note: when you reserve, call the hotel and ask for exactly the type of room you want and see if they will reserve the specific room number for you.) The room itself was in good shape and had clearly had a recent upgrade. (The major renovation was done in the early 90's judging by the installation date posted in the elevators.) The floors in all the rooms I saw had grandma-type furniture and dark hardwood floors. The desk was not set up for a business person -- no outlets nearby for a laptop or cell phone charger. Additionally, while the hotel advertises WiFi in all rooms, my WiFi connection worked only when sitting in one corner of my room, facing the corner. If WiFI is important, as for a room near one of the WiFi base stations. The minibar looked out of place, but was relatively well-stocked with typically priced items. (There's a little store just up the street for cheap water, snacks, booze, etc. -- ask at the front desk.) Room service was quick and friendly. Unfortunately, most of the hot dishes were usually luke warm on delivery. Food in the restaurant was generally very good. Great breakfast buffet. The staff all around was helpful and friendly, but mastery of English language varied from person to person. Other quirks: the doors to the rooms were like heavy doors to a bank vault. But there was no lock on the inside to keep housekeeping staff out. It was ironic to have a heavy steel door with heavy locks, that anyone from the outside could open. Definitely use the \"do not disturb\" signs. I described above that the hotel was recently renovated. Unfortunately the renovation skipped the bathroom. The bathrooms in all three rooms I saw were small and all had weird burnt-orange fixtures (including a bidet). The shower dribbled and wouldn't hold a position. The drop ceiling was stained and warped. But that was the worst part of the rooms. The neighborhood was under construction, and with all the above anomolies, I opted to move to a different hotel for my last few days, hoping to get a room with real internet access and a better locale. in summary, nice staff, quirky by decent accomodations, but not a good hotel for a business trip.", "Date": "February 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona", "Title": "\u201cNice central hotel\u201d", "Author": "2003Ibiza", "ReviewID": "UR6509776", "Content": "I stayed 3 nights in this hotel during a business tryp with my husband.

Good plentiful breakfasts in large dining room. Didn't take any evening meals as preferred to eat out in Madrids choice of many reasonably priced bars. Helpful reception staff who ironed out a problem when local taxi firm (Aerocity) fouled up on return journey to airport. Small but comfortable lounge used to take very generous nightcaps.

A great service staff fixed minor problems quickly and room service breakfast in ten minutes. There's also an enormous buffet downstairs. Great location for Metro. A nice little English book store around the corner but greatest find was our nightly 6 pm restaurant just one block away from hotel, next to the Opera. It is called La Traviata. The food was lovely , best grilled salmon I ever ate - rare steak and LARGE green salads !

I greatly appreciated my first stay at the Tryp Ambassador in 2002. The staff at that time was attentive, the room was spacious and airy, the breakfast buffet was exceptional. It was such a comfortable experience that when I returned to Madrid in 2003 I again chose to stay at the Tryp Ambassador. This time the hotel lost my reservation and the manager was extremely rude in her reception of me. She was condescending, rude, and argued that I couldn't possibly have a reservation when in fact I had twice confirmed it weeks before. Only after I produced my copy of the reservation confirmation was I grudgingly provided with a small, dark room. I was entirely appalled at this reception and at the grossly inappropriate lack of courtesy.
