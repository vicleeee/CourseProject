It is about 700 metres from Central Station and right off of Dam Square. When I booked the room I requested a room facing Damrak and when I checked in I was extremely pleased as the room was recently remodeled, was large by European standards for a standard room and was very quiet considering it faced a major street. When I checked in I mentioned two things to the front desk staff: First that I had been sick and was interested in finding a doctor and second that i needed to do 10 days worth of laundry. By the time I got to my room they were calling to let me know that they had a doctor who would come to the hotel after 5pm for 125 Euros or I could walk there (15 minutes) and it would be 50 Euros. As i was leaving to walk to the doctor they gave me a map of a place around the corner that would wash, dry and fold my laundry for 17.50 Euros. I have to say that the staff at this hotel were friendly, cheerful and went out of their way to help me and I am extremely grateful.

I had booked the hotel through Otel.com for a cheap 3 night break and requested a smoking room. I arrived at around half 12pm with my husband and we were able to check straight in, which was nice. Not so nice, was the fact that it would cost 45 euros extra for a smoking room which had not been mentioned at the time of booking! Fair enough I thought, Otel should make this clear, they probably charge extra for cleaning the rooms. When we got into the room though, the smell of stale smoke was overwhelming, topped off by sickly mint air freshener. There were scuff marks to the walls, the kettle didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work and the bottom of the mini bar was dirty. All in all, it felt a bit neglected. We left our bags and went out for some lunch, but on returning a couple of hours later the smell was just unbearable. I went to reception to ask if we could switch to a non-smoking room, but very conveniently there were no double rooms available. In the end I chose to upgrade to a superior room for an extra 75 euros, as we would have had to pay the 45 anyway! All of the reception staff were friendly and helpful, speaking excellent English, and I was able to view the superior room before committing. I must say the superior room was lovely, having recently been refurbished. It was twice the size of the standard room, with a great view and a bath \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which really swung it for me. On a couple of minor points, the TV was rather too far away from the very comfortable bed (good selection of channels though) and there was no decently lit mirror for applying make-up. A definite plus was the hair dryer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so hard to get right in a hotel! It was definitely worth the extra, but was an additional expense we had not accounted for, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget the city tax either! We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the hotel, finding 15 euros a bit steep for a buffet breakfast, but the restaurant did look busy at all times of the day. Overall although the stay was pleasant enough, I found the hotel to be lacking atmosphere \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a very small \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmotel-ish\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reception and no bar area, and I would probably choose somewhere a bit more homely if I was to visit Amsterdam again.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cLocation Location Location\u201d", "Author": "dean00_0", "ReviewID": "UR123374915", "Content": "Brilliant hotel, rooms pokey but ok.

First of all, this hotel just sucks. It is extremly expensive for the quality and price they charge and the services they provide. It is an old hotel in an old and outdated building built in 1913. The weekend I was there for they claimed they were charging 260 Euros a night! (outragious. I believe there should be some sort of regulations on these kind of thuggery as they charge what they want).The first floor is under renovation. We were put up in a so called superior room ( a blatant joke) on the 2nd floor and for all the price we payed, I could hear all their construction jazz and jack hammers in our room. When asked to be put to a different room, all I heard was that they are sold out and the 2nd floor is the only floor they have superior rooms on. Their front desk has no etiquettes. Their night person named ' Prashant' should get a job somehere as a club gatekeeper or something like that as he lacks basic talking manners and is plane 'rude' and so is there other lady who works in the mornings (sofina). Their so called manager 'Virginia\" is no better either. If you have any differences with them or if you tell them that you want a different room or comment on their services, they do not wanna talk to you. They would just ignore you. This lady Sofina or safina ( can't recall her name correctly) told me one morning that she can't talk to me about an issue with my room billing charges as she was very busy (though the front desk was empty and had no guests that she was tending to at that time). Their rooms are really small and cramped (even their so called superior rooms). Their hallways are real narrow. I could hear the foot step noises from the guests above my floor and the coughing of the other guests next door very clearly. Their TVs are a shame (real small). Their bathrooms have absolutely no space. Everything is crodwed and stuffed in their little bathrooms. The toilet seat is in a corner with no space to sit and something hanging above your head. Their bathroom sinks are small and so is their bathtub which is shielded by a half size glass partition and the water just sparkles on the bathroom floor when you shower. The heating in rooms takes forever to start (15 min or so- they claim the hot air comes from a different pipe systems) and the temp would claim to go upto 28 degree celsius but you would be freezing all night in cold Amsterdam winter weather. The hotels in the vicinity are much less inexpensive. The hotel Kransnaplosky's room rate right acroos the square was 100 Euros a night with all the basic services as this hotel provided. Hotel Doria was charging 80 Euros a night and another bigger hotel nearby (can't remember the name was charging only 120 Euros a night). What a rip off. I even saw 4 star hotels being advertirsed for the same weekend being charged at 120-130 Euros a night onnly. The only nice thing about this hotel is it's location. If you don't want to be ripped off and want better value for your money, there are plenty of nicer and much inexpensive options in the vicinity. O, please don't believe on their website propaganda and all the praises they shower on themselves.

Because in all other areas this smallish hotel is rather good. It occupies a spendid location on the Damrak immediately next to Dam square and well placed for pretty much all of the cities main sites.The main Tram Lines run past the front door and it is also no more than a ten minute trolly-case drag to and from the Railway station.The staff were(with one exception) unfailingly polite and helpful. The restaurant is quite upmarket and pricey but there is no seperate bar and so I felt as if we were imposing on the diners paying top dollar when we were using it as a bar or briefly for a coffee.And so to the accomodation! The rooms are small as you would expect in Amsterdam.But they are also in drastic need of rennovation (which to be fair is starting to happen).But in the meantime you will find your room to be badly and cheaply furnished with uncomfortable beds and a bathroom so narrow that, to be indelicate,requires some flexibility in your angle of attack to use the critical facilities. And so i would summarise thus.The Red Lion is a fabulous little hotel until you open your bedroom door. We may return in the future when the rennovations are completed but as these are evidently being done by the staff themselves maybe I shouldn't hold out much hope.Perhaps by the time we return we will have saved up enough to stay at the Barbizon Palace which is so so much better.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tracy, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, Great service! (detailed review)\u201d", "Author": "Auzeen", "ReviewID": "UR121704053", "Content": "Prior to booking any hotels we were looking for a big bathroom, good location and affordable. Great thing about Tripadvisor is that you can see the photographs that other's have taken. I read about how small the rooms were and how some bathrooms comes with a shower or a tub. I contacted De Roode Leeuw regarding this and they got back to me the following day assuring they can provide a room with a tub (for my fairly large sized husband). After I booked the Superior room, they emailed me again with positive feed back for taking the larger room and assured that we will be very happy for our week's stay. This was very comforting. We arrived at about 11am and the room was not yet ready but they took our luggage and advised us to wait 2-3 hours. Luckily there were lots to do in the area so we had something to eat then walked around for a bit. We came back at 1pm and the room was ready. The room (202) was, in my opinion, Superior as said. There were 2 twin beds pushed together with clean sheets and pillows and side by side tables. I am a religious hunter for bed bugs and I am very happy to say there were none. Even behind the beds were dust free. A wardrobe with a few shelves (we had to move the coffee and liquor around to make room). 2 chairs with a middle table (looked old but I take it in that it's not necessary to update the furniture if it's not broke). A desk with a chair (this is where we charged our electronic devices). 2 Balconies and 2 Windows with long curtains or drapes (I live like a vampire and like my room dark and the drapes really helped with that). The view was of direction towards the monument and the street with the department store across. With the drapes open the room was very bright and open. A heater (the heat didn't go very far but it kept the room survivable). A TV with a few local channels and a few channels in English A mini bar, but we were able to store our water in there at least. 2 separate bathrooms: Very modern looking and I loved how the floor was not cold when you stepped on it. One bathroom was long with a sink and a toilet. There's no window but there is a small fan. I recommend bringing an air freshener for the big loads, lol. The other was L shaped with a sink, tub and a separate shower. I absolutely loved the tub that I took a bath twice! I don't even take baths at home. There's a window far up that you can open and close with a stick that is hidden in the corner. The shower has no door so you will get some water going around the floor but just place a towel right next to it and the rest of it will dry up quickly. The room also offers a pair of slippers which helps keep your feet dry. The sizes of both bathrooms were generous and definitely worth the upgrade to the Superior rooms. The room also provided (but we didn't use), a coffee/tea machine, safe and air conditioner. The carpet was dark but looked fairly clean. From what I remember, there were a few stains but how can you expect a carpet to stay clean when you have thousands of guests per year. It was very satisfied with the cleanliness of the room. I have read in other reviews about the noise coming from the streets. Yes, there is a tram stop right in front of the hotel that go by every 2 minutes during the day and some during the night and, of course, the sound of the thousands of residents and tourists that walk by but we got used to it after the first day. There was construction in the floor beneath us but we were informed upon arrival and the sawing and drilling didn't usually happen until the late morning in which by then you shouldn't be in the hotel room but you should be out and exploring the city!! While looking for restaurants to add to the itinerary, I came across the De Roode Leeuw Restaurant a few times. It's a very popular spot as every time we walk by it's packed and it's recommended to make reservations. We tried the breakfast buffet and it was worth the 15euros. Lots of options and all kinds of drinks to choose from. The waitress was so nice and even recommended things to us. On the last 2 days we got incredibly sick and asked room service if it was possible to order from the restaurant because we didn't want to step foot outside. (There's a separate menu for room service FYI). They were very happy to accommodate that. Service was very nice. I mean don't expect them to give you the world on a silver platter and chat it up with you but they do their jobs. I wanted to call a restaurant to see what time they closed but I couldn't figure out how to use the phone in the room so I asked the front desk to call. They were very helpful with that. Housekeeping will stop you in the middle of the hall and ask if you need anything in your room to be refreshed. Check out was very informative. They explained how much of the deposit they took out and how much they will be keeping in detail and how much we will be getting back on the card right away. The best part of all was location. I could not believe how easy it was to walk everywhere we wanted. you were literally in the center of Amsterdam. From my previous Europe trip experience, I had always spread out my itinerary because I know it's hard to get a lot done in such a short period of time and all of Europe requires lots of walking. We were actually able to finish a week of things to do in just 4 days!! This is because of the location we had picked. Dam plaza and tourist shopping areas are right next to you. The trams goes to the major tourist spots, like the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum. The centraal station is just a 10 minute walk away. Red light, 5 minutes away. The nine streets is right behind the hotel and takes you down to Leidseplein and the flower markets. Jordaan is 10 minutes away. Lots of restaurants near by. It was also good for times when it started raining pretty badly. We were able to just run back to the hotel for a few hours and then come back out once the sky cleared up. The first few days we were pretty jet lagged and it was good to go out during the morning, come back to take an afternoon nap, then out again for the night. Safe area too! It's just overall the most perfect location. I really enjoyed staying at this hotel and if I ever do go back to Amsterdam, I am staying here and will try anything to ask for room 202 again. lol.

We have stayed several times in Amsterdam now and are used to the variable standard of hotels here. The Hotel Amsterdam is definitely a gem of a find. Having arrived at the tram stop directly outside the hotel, we received a genuinely warm welcome from the reception staff. We had booked a superior room as we wanted a step up from basic. We were pleasantly surprised that because my wife and I were celebrating an anniversary we had been upgraded to what I imagine is one of their junior suites. It was huge with a recently refurbished bathroom containing both bath and separate shower, separate en-suite lavatory and a seating area. The amount of space was phenomenal, occupying a corner of the hotel building with full length balcony doors facing almost onto the Dam Square. However with double glazing none of the street noise ever bothered us and the distant 'ding ding' of the trams outside only added to the great Amsterdam atmosphere we love. The bed was comfortable if a little firm but we slept well. Unlike other reviewers, we did not experience any problems with the 'open' shower cubicle in the bathroom. By using some common sense, flooding of the floor was easily avoided. The bathroom itself was beautifully done out in a contemporary style with fantastic underfloor heating. My only criticism is that because of the large sink, I found using the mirror to shave was a problem but this was a very monorail inconvenience. I came equipped with an iPad and iPhone but could easily keep connected via the wi-fi in the room which was surprisingly speedy considering it was free. The room was spotless and miraculously had regained the same condition on our return to the hotel each afternoon! My requests for wi-fi passwords, an extra blanket and even clarification of the thermostat use were met with the same faultless pleasant response from the reception staff. We could not underestimate the excellent service we received even down to the cheery hello and goodbye as left and returned to the hotel each day. As with all hotel breakfasts in Amsterdam, the price was more than you pay in most of the cafes around the city, so as usual we chose to find a little 'hoek' by a canal to watch the world go by. Therefore I cannot comment on the quality of breakfast offered at the hotel. We came to the hotel with certain expectations, but found these had been far surpassed. I understand that the reat of the rooms are all currently being refurbished and if ours was anything to go by then I am sure the rest will not disappoint. One last note which has really impressed me and is indicative of the standard we found on our visit here at the end of November - the manager has responded to every comment placed on here. This clearly shows that the management are interested in what the customers think at the end of the day. Keep up the good work!

Since we were staying for 5 days they \"upgraded\" us to a bigger room (still had the two twin beds pushed together) - but as you know all hotel rooms in Europe are small so I'd hate to see what the other size was! The room also had a weird smell - like a musty wet smell - even bought Febreze to try to get rid of it to no avail. If they would replace the carpet and do a fresh coat of paint it would help a lot. But the bathrooms have been updated which is great, but the shower is small and there is no shower door which is a little strange and water gets all over the floor (perhaps the source of the weird smell?). There is a big grocery store called Albert Heijn only a block away which is awesome but strangely they don't accept credit cards. Would I stay here again? Probably not - would pay a little more and try to stay at the Swiss Hotel next door since it's nicer.

HOWEVER, unless you pay a LOT more for a European hotel room, tiny is what you will get almost everywhere! Perhaps best of all were the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153front end\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd people. They were knowledgeable, they were helpful, they were courteous, and they were friendly. You cannot beat the transportation convenience of this hotel. One of the city's tram lines stopped right in front of the hotel entrance! De Roode Leeuw is located on a main street and is actually a very short walk from the main train station. Since we traveled from Amsterdam to Bruges, Belgium by train, this was VERY convenient. Furthermore, the starting point for canal tours is in front of the train station, slightly closer to the hotel. The hotel is also within walking distance of many sights of this wonderful city. I recommend a stroll through the infamous \"Red Light\" district, even if you are happily married and with your partner. It is quite interesting. The hotel has its own restaurant, and there are many interesting shops nearby if you just like to browse the touristy stuff.", "Date": "May 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia Beach", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location\u201d", "Author": "JudyVirginiaBeach", "ReviewID": "UR64266961", "Content": "My husband booked this hotel because of it's location and he chose well.

I have stayed in many mid-market city centre hotels and this hotel compared very favourably. The location of the hotel was perfect; close to everything (transport, restaurants, shopping, etc). I had booked a double room and that is what we got with no problem whatsoever. Mid-price city centre hotels tend to be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccompact\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and this was as expected.

Obviously newly installed and to the highest of standards. Other than breakfast, we did not eat in the restaurant so I cannot comment on the quality. However, I can say that the restaurant itself was very pleasantly appointed. The menu was traditional Dutch fare and appeared to be reasonably priced. This was endorsed by the fact that every evening and lunchtime it was extremely busy. Our room rate included breakfast which consisted of a hot and cold buffet. This was a relatively modest selection but perfectly adequate. My only comment would be that at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15 it appeared a bit on the expensive side. I have nothing to compare this with other than my experience in similar hotels in the UK. However, as breakfast was included in our rate this was not an issue.

I had read some good reviews on this place so was hopeful it would meet expectations. Firstly, on the plus side, the location of this hotel was very good. Virtually next to Dam Square and very convenient for many of the central attractions. The location is busy at all hours but was an easy walk from the station, red light district, Anne Frank's house and the cruise tour depot. Getting around the city was very convenient from this hotel. On the negative side we were disappointed with the condition of our room. I have traveled around the world and seen all sorts of 4* hotels, this one I did not feel lived up to its status. The communal decor of the hotel (outside the small lobby) I felt was very dated and our room had peeling Artex wallpaper and felt dark with old fashioned mahogany fixtures and lurid starched bed covers. The external aspect over an air conditioning unit/back of a neighbouring building was not very pleasant but at least we could kind of see a bit of Nieuwe Kerk. I felt a bit embarrassed as I had booked this trip for me and my partner for a romantic getaway but I felt the quality of the room was far worse than any other 4* hotel we had visited and for the money I would have expected better. Nevertheless we tried to spend as little time as possible in the room. On the plus side the bathroom appeared to have been recently modernised with contemporary fixtures though it was extremely small and the open 'wet room' effect shower just made for a horrible wet floor around the toilet which was very unpleasant to be standing in. The staff were all friendly and helpful at the front desk but aside from that I would not reccommend this hotel if you are looking for a true quality get away. If you need a well located crash pad when city-breaking that is good for getting around, sure, this would probably suit your needs. But anything beyond that, if you seek a bit of character, charm, opulence, relaxation, no way - this is not the place for you. Maybe we were just unlucky with our particular room and in that part of the hotel.

I wouldn't like to be sharing. The windows of my room opened to a view of a brick wall of the building across the laneway, and whilst uninspiring, I appreciated the central location of the hotel and that not every room can face the front. Fortunately(?), my view was of a portion of the building that did not have any windows, so I did feel a sense of privacy when I had my windows open. The heating in my room was adequate, the double-glazing kept the noise out, I slept well, and the staff were friendly. The room was clean and stocked with all of the usual ameneties, including a mini bar and although a surcharge was payable (15 Euro), I was grateful for the option of a smoking room (a rarity in Amsterdam).

Most of the rooms are very loud and you will not have a peaceful and quite stay here. If you like newer and updated this is NOT the hotel for you. If you like open, airy, and bright rooms this is NOT the hotel for you. If you like quite and peace this is NOT the hotel for you. If you like having nice views from your room this is NOT the hotel for you. We left within 30 min after checking in and expedia took care of us immediately. I do have to say the front desk girl and manager were very very nice to us. We loved how they treated us the little bit of time we were there, but their sweetness was not going to change how dissapointed we felt with the hotel itself. We did not like it all and would never book a room there. It was totally worth paying $200 more and stayed at a absolutely gorgeous hotel with views of the river/canals to die for!!!

The room itself was very spacious and clean, and a fun mix of modern and aged fixtures (flat screen tv and modern bathroom fixtures and windows juxtaposed the curtains, lamp shades, and carpet that hinted of the disco era - though very clean). The amenities were great, and everything was kept stocked and cleaned daily. The showering area was different than we are accustomed to (squeegie included), but we read that full sized tubs are quite a luxury in this area, so it was not a surprise. The bed and pillows were comfortable, and the lighting more than adequate (we had the corner room three stories above the entrance with four huge windows and a smaller bathroom window). I was very impressed with the security of the hotel (in room safe, room key required to use the elevator, and small lobby the required you walk just feet from the 24hr attendant to access the hotel). Breakfast was always good, and the service was always fast and friendly. We also ate at the restaurant for a classic regional dinner, and rate it a 9/10 as well (see the restaurant review for more). The staff seemed to truly enjoy their jobs (or at least acted as such very well), which made the stay very pleasant. (We also happened to stay during a holiday and were able to watch the Queen assist in the Memorial Day event from our window!)

Plus, the price was right in the package we booked, so we took the faith leap and booked our 5 night stay here. We were also impressed that the hotel management responded to each review on TripAdvisor - however, I've realized now that a management response AFTER you've had a bad experience doesn't really help you when you're holding your nose to tolerate the bathroom smell while you're there. I wish we'd have forked up the extra $200 and stayed somewhere else. I'm a travel writer, and try to be fair in my reviews, but honestly, I can't recommend that you stay here. There is one good thing I can think of - LOCATION. If location is what swings you on a hotel room, you really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat the Hotel Amsterdam. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 5-7 minute walk down Damrak to Central Station, and you can practically spit on Dam Square, with the Royal Palace. For those Americans that just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay away, there is a McDonalds and a KFC right next door. If vices are up your alley, then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mere steps from the Red Light District, the Vodka Museum and the Sex Museum. There are tons of restaurants within walking distance, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tram stop smack dab in front of the front door. That's where the good stopped for us. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t terribly impressed with the room we were given upon check in. Located on the first floor, it looked worn and drab. It was large for a European room, which was great, but it was big on size and small on, well, nice. Stains on the carpet, worn spots on the chairs, and two twin beds instead of one king. We were right next to a shared-by-all-guests restroom (though each room had it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own) and was straight across from the elevator. It was loud, and kind of seedy-looking, so we asked to change rooms. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible the first night, but we were moved on night two. The new room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as big, but had a king bed and looked at first glance to have more charm. There were stained glass windows and a balcony overlooking the Damrak. However, if you peeked behind curtains, there were mouse-sized holes in the walls (chewed by whom?) and more stains. Not to mention that the great view during the day became an overlook for party central at night. We went from a loud room to a louder room. Additionally, the hot water in the bathroom sink didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually heat up until you turned thebathtub water on. We should\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve complained again, but my boyfriend didn't think it would help, and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be the rude Americans, so we put up with it and avoided our room until we absolutely needed to sleep. The worst part was the smell that stank up our bathroom - it was almost unbearable. It smelled like the mildew had become self-aware, it had been there for so long. It got to the point where we had to hold our nose to shower. The staff weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the brightest bulbs in the bunch, either. There were a few exceptions, but I expected them to be more help with directions and activities (but they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.) We try very hard not to be the \"spoiled American\" tourists, and have come to understand and accept the differences between what a 3-star is in the States and what it is in Europe. Plus, I seldom spend a lot of time in my room - I'd rather be out experiencing the culture and seeing the sites. Thank goodness this beautiful city overshadowed the bad hotel experience. There are so many hotels to chose from, and honestly, in a city with public transport as good as this one, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine that any location would have you too far from the action.

My other half says 'it's just somewhere to sleep' but if you're like me, you look forward to day trips then coming back to your hotel to freshen up etc so it's a bit more than that. The good sides - we loved the location, it was totally spot on and not at all noisy even though it was right on Damrak. The main square is less than one minutes walk and the tram stop is just outside. Staff were friendly, well presented and breakfast was good with a wide range of food on offer. If things run out, don't be afraid to ask as they are really happy to help. The not so good side - the hotel (according to signs up in it) has had a smoking ban since July 2008 - all the rooms on our floor had smoking signs on them (we stayed on 2nd floor) and there was an ashtray and matches in our room. I have to be brutal here but our room absolutely STUNK of smoke. The curtains, the chairs, the over cover on the bed - it really was off putting -I was all for complaining but my 'keep the peace' other half said he could live with it as we were hardly going to be in it. In the shower (which was FAB and hot and lovely) there was nowhere to put your shampoo/soap etc so it had to go on the floor around your feet - not ideal. The toilet was a 'shelf loo' so everything that goes down there sits on a shelf before being washed away - I had a real problem with this as we didn't see this anywhere else in the City. Maybe it was because it was smelling of stale smoke, but the room felt dirty and unfortunately it was only as we were leaving and did an 'under the bed search for stuff left behind' did we find someone elses slippers - it looked like it hadn't been hoovered in weeks. The reason this review is hard is because we've agreed that if we go to Amsterdam again, we would probably stay here for the location but ask to be transferred to another room if there was a problem. Halfway through our stay a lovely staff member asked if all was ok and I stupidly said 'yes' - I just hate to make a scene so thought it easier to shut up - I now wish I'd said something as although not for my husband, for me it really made the whole trip a little tainted.

The waiter hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really seem surprised when I returned for that second glass of beer.

The staff were very, very helpful and even when we requested a late check out, they sorted it no problem with no charge, even though it stated in the hotel guide an extra charge would be made. The rooms were quite small but more than adequate for a long weekend. The air-con was somewhat efficient, but as the weather was boiling outside, was quite welcome! The beds were very comfy and the bathroom was more than good enough. The hotel didn't have a bar, although there was a public restaurant downstairs, the food looked quite expensive. We used the minibar for any drinks/snacks we wanted, wasn't too expensive like the rest of Amsterdam, 3eur for a beer for example. Amsterdam itself is a fantastic place, with more than enough to see and do. We took a trip round the canals and went to various odd museums you won't find anywhere else. The red light district is also a must see!! There are 300 'coffee shops' around, so the place has a very distinct smell wherever go!!! The best place we found was The Grasshopper and 2 min walk from the hotel with a bar upstairs and a coffee shop downstairs and had a wonderful outside terrace where you could drink or smoke or do both if required!!!!

Rene Wildeman replied immediately and the reservations department got back to me letting me know they would try to put us together, and then offered us an upgrade for $31 per night per room. We accepted it, and was glad we did since I saw a regular room later on and it was tiny. I am pretty sure our luggage would not fit in there. We took the train from Schipol to Central Station and then walked the straight road to the hotel. It was about 7 mins away. Check in was prompt, the desk people were very friendly and the rooms were ok. They were dark since they were in the back with no view at all but the size of the rooms were amazing. I did not like the toiletries that came with the hotel however. The shampoo felt like watered down laundry detergent. I would recommend taking your own supply. Also, a warning, be careful of what you sign up for as wireless internet. We were told to open the internet page and follow instructions to sign up for internet. Well, we turned on my laptop and Tmobile came up. So we signed up for it, and lost signal right after that. Turns out that was not what the hotel offered. So, I will now have to dispute those charges since the connection was bad and I did not get access at all except for the first few mins it needed the credit card number. The beds were very comfortable, the toilet paper felt like sandpaper :) The location was unbeatable. It was in the middle of the tourist section. After I saw where the Crowne Plaza and Marriott was located, I was glad I won the Red Leeow bid, since we like being in the center of touristy things and this was it. The RDL was literally a block away, we could be there in about 5 mins. Loved Extase coffee shop, people in Amsterdam were so so friendly I cant begin to say enough! Remember to buy water from the supermarket near Madame Tussauds, much cheaper than anywhere else. We were charged city taxes of 5.66 euros per night per room. Room service was quick and efficient. Only once did we come back and see that housekeeping had kept a bag of trash on the bathroom sink and had forgotten to remove it, however someone came up in seconds after I called the front desk and had it cleared and kept on aplogizing. There was an electric kettle in the rooms with cups, coffees, teas, sugar and creamer. The only thing I did not like was the absence of an iron in the room. I was told we would need to go to the ironing room on the third floor to iron...which felt wierd. We also asked if we could keep one room till about 1pm and check out from the other two rooms since our flight was at 5pm and we were planning to leave the hotel around 2pm. The desk agent was very quick to say \"no\" and it was abrupt, if the other agents had not been nice I would have had a problem with it.

As long as you get a good deal on the price, you can't go wrong. It's location is perfect - right on Dam Square, seconds away from the Royal Palace, Madame Tussaud's (which I also recommend), museums, tours, shopping, restaurants, and the infamous Red Light District. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. I would advise that if you plan on sleeping in in the mornings, don't forget to put out the \"Do not Disturb\" sign as the cleaning staff are up early and very persistent. The hotel had a few english speaking TV news and entertainment channels available, and the TV was a nifty little flatscreen. The choice of movies was fairly good too. Only negative point: The room was small. We only saw the standard (or \"comfortable\") room, so I don't know how much bigger the \"superior\" rooms were. If you get the choice, ask for a room with a bath as the bathroom will be bigger and the shower is attached anyway. The \"double\" bed was two single beds pushed together, and the only other things that could fit in the room were a desk and a chair. But that aside, the room was clean, not completely out-dated, reasonably quiet, and perfect for falling asleep in after a big day out. We booked the room online for around \u00c2\u00a360 ($100USD) per night. This was about half the average price quoted on this site at the time, and way way way below the price on their web site. So considering the excellent location, staff, and price, the size of the room was easy to overlook. If you do get a good deal on this hotel, and you are prepared for the room to be small, you will absolutely not be disappointed. I would definitely stay here again. A few helpful tips: #1. The English name for the hotel is \"The Red Lion\". I found it was easier to say this than pronounce the Dutch name. #2. There is a shuttle bus from the airport. It costs 12 euro per person and drops you off across the square from the hotel. A taxi is about 35 euro (but be careful because the taxi drivers in Amsterdam will try to con you). The train to Central Station is only around 4 euro and it is about a 15-20 minute walk up the main street to the hotel. A cheap option if you have very little baggage. #3. Breakfast at the hotel is 11 euro. That sounds expensive, but that's what you'll end up paying in a similar setting elsewhere in the area.
