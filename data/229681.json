The Regencia was perfect in every way for us: an easy cab trip from the airport, perfectly situated and close to La Rambla, immaculately clean but non-fancy rooms, and a price that couldn't be beat.

It is behind the Hotel Colon and just a short walk to the Gothic Cathedral. The hotel was spotlessly clean and very basic. Our room was the same as most hotels that I have stayed in before but very functional. It did seem to be bit noisy but what else can you expect in the busy area that the hotel is located. It didn't trouble us unduly. The breakfast was a buffet style and you could choose cereals and then you had scrambled eggs, bacon and little sausages. There was a toaster to use with choices of bread . There was also a selection of cold meats and fruits with yoghurts and croissants. It was a little samey after the first two days but at least it set you up for the day. There are loads of places to get coffees and snacks. Las Ramblas is only a few minutes walk through a little warren of streets with little shops. There is also a tourist bus which you can buy a 1 or 2 day ticket for. this takes you to all the tourist places on either the red, blue or green route. You get offat the stops and then get back on the next bus when you are ready. Sagrada Familia is fantastic and worth a visit. We then went to Park Guell where Guadi lived for 20 years and there is a museum there. The Casa Batllo is well worth a visti but may seem quite expensive but the building is amazing. We walked for miles but is worth the effort and there are some fantastic eateries. The main one we used was Choquitas on Las Ramblas and the waiters were very friendly. The best two were Estruch which is opposite the Gothic Cathedral just round the corner from the hotel. The food was excellent and good value for the portion size. The most relaxed one was at the port and is called the Celler de Tapas in Placa Universitat.

A nice improvement from three years ago is you now pay for your elevator ticket along with your entrance fee and you are given a choice of taking the elevator up and down. In the past, taking the elevator down was not an option, and an unwelcome surprise for visitors who had to make the trek down the scary spiral stairs. When visiting Sagrada Familia be sure to arrive when it opens at 9 a.m. otherwise you\u2019ll waste a lot of time waiting in line to enter. Also, allow 3-4 hours so you\u2019re sure to see everything. No visit to Barcelona is complete without eating at least once at the Mercado de la Boqueria. If you love markets, you will love the Boqueria. At the market you will find the freshest fruit, bocadillos (bocattas), and seafood in Barcelona, and it is the cheapest place to eat. For example, one morning my husband and I each had a fresh fruit salad, a large bocatta, and a coffee for 11 euros (total). The Boqueria is my favorite eatery in Barcelona and I will miss it. Getting around Barcelona is so easy. The metro system is great and cheap\u2014a T-10 card costs around 8 euros and can be shared. However, I think you\u2019ll find that you may prefer to walk because the sights are all so close to each other and if you\u2019re underground you\u2019ll miss the art and architecture that fills the city (we\u2019re not fans of buses so we tend to avoid those, when possible). One last comment, be wary of pickpockets and bag thieves. We didn\u2019t have a problem, but we heard the frantic screams of a woman who had placed her bag down for a moment only to have it disappear in an instant. A woman should never, ever, take her bag off of her lap in a restaurant and a man should wear a wallet that is chained to his belt.

We had to leave earlier in the morning just to get breakfast at the airport. Each day we had to go across the street to get our ice at their sister hotel. No one to help with your bags (no valet) and you have to carry your bags up a stairway to get in & out of the hotel (bad for anyone with a disability). By America standards, this is barely a 2 star, maybe 1 1/2 star. Also, because we had to leave the window open it was too noisey to sleep as people party until 5am here. Only good thing------super location. \" Here is what I think of this opinion and my opinion on the hotel as well: - The hotel has air conditioners. We were in the hotel on 15-th of Novermber 2010 and have stayed for 3 nights. In the corridor it was so hot compared to the weather outside (14 degrees C) that we did not needed air conditioning. - You need the buffet breakfast to open before 7 am, wow? The museums in Barcelona open at 10:00 am usually, La Rambla's stores and restaurants stay opened even after at 24:00. This is not Vienna, where most stores and restaurants are closed at 18:00 o'clock. Do you have any store in your neighborhood that opens prior to 7:00 am, but is not working non-stop? I would never get out of bed before 9:00am when I am for a leisure trip, except if I am to catch my flight/train/bus early. I cannot believe that you haven't prepared in advance for this event. And do you need to eat before 7:00 am seriously? I am not hungry at this time ever. Have you actually thought that the other countries around the World, might not have your breafast schedule? - Why do you need ice (uh and in November)?! I don't know if you have heard, but this is not an all-exclusive hotel, is it? I would usually get the ice with my beer, and probably I will take that in one of the restaurants around the hotel. I am wondering how these people have managed to remain calm and provide you with what you need from their sister hotel. In the end, why didn't you rebooked and took the other hotel? - I am wondering how are you going to reach into the airport or explore the city if you do not have the strength to move your luggage some 10 steps up or down. The elevator of the hotel works for the rest. I would advice you not to go to Europe any more - we have hotels with more than 300 steps - it could cost your life to reach the hotel. There are lots of hotels without elevators. - Let me know, which American hotel in the heart of New York would cost me some close to the price for this hotel and compare it. The rooms were very very tidy, and what you have there in the rooms is really nice! I have been in Italy, France, Austria, Germany, Monaco, Slovakia, Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, Switzerland in 2 or 3 star hotels and only one of the six 3 star hotels in Switzerland (Bristol in Zurich), is comparable to this one. The lady that cleans the rooms is perfect, the furniture is perfect, they have an LCD with maybe 100+ channels but I really do not care about TV (my girl listens to music, hence I skipped more than 100 channels to find one). - The location of the hotel is superb. I always choose the best locations before I choose a hotel. - This hotel is noisy - and I knew that before I have visited the hotel. There are two things a man can do about this usually - to get a room which is more quite than the other rooms (I got our room on the last floor), and to put something in his ears. Of course you decided to open the window of the room, so that it noisier to you - cool! And the noisy there is not from parties around - they are simply cleaning up the streets at 1-2am night (yes, it is a clean area). - What my girl and I need from a hotel: - Good location - Good sleep - Good service - Clean hotel - Comfortable room The only true con of this hotel is the noise. By the way the receptionsts are nice, and make nice jokes. It wasn't a problem to leave our luggage in the hotel for many hours after we checked out, or to check out with some delay. We also got a free map, some nice tips for newbies to Barcelona, a large room for 3 (we have paid for a double room) And my girl is really thankful to the lady that is cleaning the rooms every day - my girl is pedantic when it comes to cleaning. If you use a towel - the lady will change it the next day, something that they did not do neither in Zurich, Bern or Geneva - three of the most expensive cities in the World. Have some nice time in Barcelona, definetly choose a hotel in Barry Gotic and if you your pocket matches this hotel - choose it. If you have more time to prepare or if you are more people, an apartment could do a great job too I trust. Don't choose a hotel on La Rambla...

Just minutes by foot from Las Ramblas and many of the museums and if you like music Palau de la Musica Catalana. This area is full of restaurants, shops and life. We rented a car for couple of days and it was very convenient that our hotel has a contract with the parking situated under the Cathedral Square. You pay only 20\u20ac per day including unlimited amount of outgoings - note you have to ask first that from your hotel reception - otherwise you pay over 2\u20ac per hour ! This parking has the best facilities and is easiest to drive in/out. The staff really wants to help you so don\u00b4t hesitate to ask. We got our problems solved everytime - Great ! They all seem to speak good English. Our room was normal size with roomy bathroom. All the premises were very clean and aircondition worked well, maybe bit noisy if you like cool room. We used the mildest no 1 position out of three. Only thing that needs your extra care is thiefs - they are clever. Keep an eye of your bags and do not leave them unattended. My wife lost her purse in Starbucks nearby - it was in her bag but unluckily leaned from backside of the chair. I would recommend this hotel to my friends because of good service and location.

We were extremely lucky that the weekend we were there was the only warm and sunny weekend in between weeks of snowy freezing temperatures. Upon checking in to the hotel, the receptionist was very helpful providing maps and giving info re bus tours etc. We had booked a B&B deal although the receptionist was convinced that breakfast had not been included in the rate until I managed to find the booking confirmation. The hotel room was small but comfortable with two single beds a small dressing table and wardrobe. The bathroom was clean and spacious with a power shower. The bathroom led out to the balcony with a view of the cathedral to one side. We were very lucky to get the only room with a balcony and assume this was just because it was low season. The windows were not double glazed and had a pull down shutter on the exterior, there was a little noise at night as the window of our room overlooked the side room which led on to Via Laietana which is one of Barcelona's busiest throroughfares so perhaps best to take a pair of ear plugs if travelling in the summer. I do not recall whether the room was air conditioned as, given the time of year we went, we did not have use of it. The breakfast was a continental buffet with a good selection of with the usual cooked meats, fruit, yoghurt and coffee. In terms of location, the hotel is brilliantly placed, close to all the action, tourist hot spots, beach, harbour, cathedral and public transport with two metro stops only a short walk away. The metro system is one of the most efficient that I have encountered thus far and always on time. All in all a very good deal considering the prices generally in Barcelona; which can be significant.

It was clean and comfortable so that was alright by me for the price we paid. The bathroom on the other hand was tiny. The only real complaint I have about it was that some of the toiletries were used and placed back in the basket on the sink. I took them out and set them aside and the cleaner replaced them the next day. Overall, the bathroom was clean and there was hot water so it worked for me. I must admit, I booked this hotel already knowing what others were saying that the walls were really paper thin and they were right. Thankfully I can sleep through a lot but my friend that I was traveling with was up almost all night because of the excessive noise outside and from the room next door. If you are a light sleeper this isnt the hotel for you. If you can handle a little noise, then I have no problem recommending it. The location was absolutely fabulous. We were within walking distance to most of the major sights and the hop on hop off bus picked up right outside the square. I couldnt have asked for a better location. We didn't want to be right on Las Ramblas so this was perfect, only a 5 minute walk from it and everything else. If you are in the mood for some great mexican food, there is a little restaurant down the street (the main one where the hop on bus picks up and as Starbucks) called Rosa Negra (i think).

Its a good 3 star hotel with extremely courteous helpful staff and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. The front desk staff gave us lots of information about what to do and see whilst in Barcelona, and when we expressed an interest in open topped tour buses, sold us tickets at a discounted rate. (This is a brilliant way to see the city) They didn't push this, just responded when asked. One night we returned to the hotel and my partner bounded up the front steps and completely missed the central opening part of the plate glass door and bounced off the fixed glass panel at the side (he blamed his poor eye sight but it may have had more to do with the local brew) and the chap on the desk was concerned and solicitous and supressed his mirth admirably (which was more than I managed to do!) We checked out the breakfast on the first morning and had it every day after that! At \u20ac12 it sounds expensive but it was really tasty and plentiful, with the usual spread of cereals fruit, yogurts toast, rolls, croissants & muffins - plus hot choices of scrambled egg, bacon and sausage, as well as Spanish cured meats (chorizo, morcilla etc) & cheeses. Fresh fruit juices tea & coffee. It was replenished right up until 10.30 when it finished. The room was larger than average and spotless, and the sheets were changed during our stay. The bed was a tad firm but that's just a personal preference. The bathroom had the usual array of toiletries, and the hot water was constant and the shower had good pressure. I have read comments that the hotel is in a noisy position, and to be honest there was quite a bit of noise but as it is only a stones throw from the beautiful old cathedral and the bells chime every 15 minutes so there's no getting away from that. Otherwise our stay wasn't typical because whilst we were there they were busy erecting the biggest stage I've seen outside Glastonbury, about 70 yards from the hotel, in preparation for Catalonia s largest music festival. There was a cherry picker type lift pipping all night and they were pressure hosing the stones. I would still say get ear plugs if you're a light sleeper rather than miss out on this lovely little hotel. One tip - the nicest restaurant we found by far was Les Quinze Nits (not a typo). It's in the Plaza Real and you can't miss it. Look for the huge snaking queue! Not only is everything delicious but it is cheaper than all it's neighbours. They lay up the tables for dinner at 8pm and the queue starts to form by about 6.45, so sit down about half six, have a few leisurely drinks and stay on for dinner. Lots of buskers to keep you amused. (And one or two 'characters')!

Hotel staff were all very friendly, and spoke really good english.Staff gave us tips on were to go on each night and maps and directions to the best bars and restaurants. The hotel itself was nice, clean and a bit quiet, which was good. The hotel is literally 20 seconds away from the well known catherdral, and the cathedrals square. Las Ramblas is approximately 6-7 minute walk away, the marina is about 25 min walk away, and the beaches are about 50 min walk away. The walk to the beach is not the bad really, as there's bars and restaurants, shops, etc everywhere you go, so theres always places to stop in and have a drink or bite to eat whilst your walking. It cost around 7-8 euros in a taxi from the beach back to the hotel, which is cheap. Check out was 12 o clock, but we were catching the bus from the bus station at 6pm, we asked the staff is there anyway we could leave our luggage, and they said no problem and we could put them in a locked cupboard until we were ready to go, which we did! this worked out very handy for us. The hotel is next door to Hotel Colon (sister hotel) which has a restaurant and WiFi access. But there's so much going on elsewhere around Barcelona, that we never visited this hotel, and ventured out elsewhere around the town. Some people may find it a little noisy outside at times but thats what you must expect from a central hotel!! if you want a hotel in a quiet surrounding, you will have to look right outside barcelona. We enjoyed our stay here and are planning on a weeks stay, next year, in August. Theres so much to see and do in Barcelona, it really is a great place to visit. The nightlife here is also really good, check out, Shoko + Opium down by the beach front.

Location The hotel is located in the city center, in the Barri Gotic near the Cathedral. Subway station is nearby (Jaume I, Placa de Catalunya,..). The hotel is located close to the main shopping area of Barcelona. Moreover it is close to many restaurants and bars. It's a 5 minute walk to the Rambla, which is the most famous street of Barcelona, and a 5-10 minute walk to Placa de Catalunya, the central area of the city where the aerobus drops you off when you're coming from the airport. A possible disadvantage of the central location is the fact that there is some noise from the street at night. Nevertheless I think this is typical for hotels in big cities. 2. Food The breakfast was pretty good for a 3 star hotel. Everything was fresh and there was enough choice. There were croissants, little breads, toasts, cakes, eggs and bacon, fresh fruit, yoghurts, ... The buffet didn't change during the six days we've stayed in the hotel. 3. Service The reception staff was always very friendly and helpful. They helped us with our questions about transport to the airport. The waiter in the morning wasn't really that friendly. He got mad quite quickly. When the breakfast room was full one morning, he practically yelled at people who were still trying to find a place to sit : \"Compledo!! Full!\" 4. Room The bedroom was rather small but comfortable. The bath was also pretty small, but good enough. The room was made up every day very well. There was soap, body milk, toothbrushes,... in the bathroom. There was a minibar (that was switched off) and a safe. One disadvantage: the first days of our stay we could litteraly hear almost every word our neighbours said. And they woke up around 7 am. The last days of our stay we got other neighbours who were much more quiet and calm. However, the isolation of the room just wasn't good enough, in our opinion 5. Facilities There is an elevator, a restaurant (only for breakfast) and a sitting and reception area. In the hotel next to \"Regencia colon\" was hotel \"Colon\". This is a 4* hotel located at the cathedral square. In this hotel there actually was a real restaurant where you could have dinner. Conclusion: A good 3* hotel with a perfect location.

Also, another past poster is correct--the breakfast is overpriced and not worth it. The room was fine (which helped) and clean (ditto), but the shower door was only a half door, so water got on the floor easily.

If you are a vegetarian, you might find the breakfast a bit light. If I should find something to nitpick about, I would say that it was annoying that the bathroom for the room next door was by the door and the shower and toilets were very clearly heard to our room.

There is a taxi stand across Laitana so it isn\u2019t necessary to call cabs unless you need someone to pull in front for heavy bags. I always told taxis to take us back to Laitana, circa del Catedral, (very easy) and that got us right around the corner. I stayed in this hotel twice, once for a long weekend before a cruise and then for another long weekend at the end. The two rooms which I was given, 556 and 557, were next to each other on the fifth floor (which I had requested) and close to the corner where there is a partial view of of the Cathedral Square (and lots of light but not a view of the Cathedral). The rooms were identical, mirror images of each other. Decorated in chintz, each came equipped with two beds, a desk, a minibar with room to put a couple of water bottles, a safe, a place to hang clothes with very limited drawer space, and a desk chair. The room was certainly decently sized and perfectly adequate. The fifth floor has tiny balconies outside the rooms on this side of the hotel. The balconies are miniscule, but you can step out and check the weather. There are shutters on the doors which can be lowered to keep out light and the hotel uses old fashioned metal keys, which are kept at the desk. The bathroom was small, but also perfectly fine. It contained a hair dryer, a tub with shower, toilet and bidet. Everything worked. Toiletries provided included a shampoo/conditioner, shower gel, soap, and toothpaste/toothbrush kits, shower cap, and a shoe-shine cloth. The safe was quirky but worked. Instructions say to press the red button on the back of the door to reset the combination. Unfortunately, there is no red button and when you press the button that is there, you need to make sure you press and hold it sufficiently before trying to enter your new code. If you need help, one of the desk guys will come up. There are some differences between the Regencia Colon and a more expensive hotel (I stayed in the NH Duc de la Victoria last year, for example, and found the bed and bedding there of higher quality.) The Regencia Colon lacked Kleenex and there are no robes or slippers. The desk guys (Jose, Luis and David) are all very nice and try to be as helpful as possible. Just know that their knowledge can be limited (especially related to food!) We were given directions to the PANS when we wanted to go to the Bocatta one day. Victor, who does the reservations and is very efficient, seemed to have no knowledge of most of my restaurant requests. I provided him with the telephone numbers and he made the calls (I had written to the hotel several weeks in advance to make the reservations, but they said there had been computer problems and they hadn\u2019t received the requests.) If you do your homework and simply need help with the map, you\u2019ll be okay or if you want suggestions for the neighborhood, they can help. We also asked for extra towels and pillows and received these without any problem. At these prices you can\u2019t expect first rate concierge-quality help. As many have commented, the rooms at the front of the hotel are just off the Cathedral Square, which often features loud music blared through speakers and a variety of concerts. The Cathedral clock chimes every fifteen minutes. People can be noisy and the noise seems to carry very easily. We also noted the arrival of the garbage trucks sometime early (or maybe in the middle of the night) on the first morning we were there. The big problem is that the room in November was stifling hot. Since you can\u2019t control the heat (and apparently once the hotel turns it on, it stays on until the month they turn it off), you are forced to open the doors or windows. While this solves the temperature problem, it means you will need ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Since I have no trouble going back to sleep, it was a minor problem for me, but I can see how it would be a big problem for others. There is plenty of eating close by. You can walk to virtually all of the Barri Gotic eateries and those in the Born. For breakfast, there is a PANS and a Bocatta two minutes away, Neyras is around the corner, and best of all, the Boqueria is an easy walk away for a memorable breakfast. Don't miss the Boqueria -- it's a fabulous market just for sightseeing. The front desk sells Hop On Hop Off bus tickets for the same price you pay at the Catalunya hub. If you buy at the hotel, you can get on the Blue Route bus right across Laitana and do the entire loop without having to stand on line at Catalunya. If you want the Red Route, you simply transfer at the first transfer point, which is the Gaudi houses \u2013 La Padrera and Casa Bottilo (the first stop for the Red Route). As many have said, the HOHO bus is the best way to do the sights in Barcelona. We paid 26 euros for two consecutive days (the cost is 23 euros for one day at the moment). You can stay on the bus and get an overview, get off at the stops that interest you and ride the buses as many hours as you like. We paid different rates for different nights at the Regencia Colon (it was significantly cheaper at the end of November than it had been two weeks before but I think it also depends on the cruise schedules since many of their clients seemed to be cruisers.) I booked through the hotel website and we paid in euros at the end of each stay, which worked well for us since the value of the dollar was significantly better when we paid than when we booked! On the whole, other than the noise problem, this is an excellent pick if you want to save money and be in a great location.", "Date": "December 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat service and location!\u201d", "Author": "Jinglegirl_8", "ReviewID": "UR22471227", "Content": "This hotel had a terrific location just across from the Gothic Cathedral.

I got the absolutely cutest room up on the 5th floor, tucked into a corner, obviously modernized within the past few years and with every touch exactly as I would have designed it. Little stuff that might not sound like it makes much of a difference: A light in the closet! Warm-colored (instead of white) walls! Enough hangers! A built-in stand for your suitcase with trim on the back that helps you keep from dinging up the wall! Extra switches for all the lights next to the bed! A fridge that you can put your stuff in without breaking a seal that brings the Mini-Bar Charge Police! Good, light-blocking shutters! Yummy coconut-scented shampoo & lotion freebies instead of some gross perfume-y smell! And best of all, a satisfying shower that has enough door on it that you don't end up spraying the whole room! - The cleanliness. I couldn't find anything to quibble with, and there were little signs everywhere that the cleaning lady had been there. It's a small enough hotel that there may be one person who does the cleaning, and she seems to take pride in her work. - Location. Really perfect. - Yeah, the breakfast is a bit pricey, but it's also very complete and good, with fresh Spanish cheese and fresh orange slices along with all the usual cereal/toast/coffee/tea stuff. On your first day, it's a perfectly reasonable way to get off to a good start. It's hard to think of any negatives, although if you feel strange sleeping with earplugs in you'll definitely want to stay somewhere else. The only thing I can think of is that although Spain's new anti-smoking law is most definitely respected and enforced, if I left the bathroom window open some second-hand smoke came in that way (maybe from an employee break room below?).

Overall, we thought the hotel was fine. The room was large, with a telelvision, safe, large bathroom with plenty of hot water, and it was clean. The hotel staff were very nice to us, but they were nicer to my wife than to me. They did offer many recommendations for dinner (some were very good, some were terrible), and helped us with taxis and show reservations. The biggest problem with this hotel is the noise. There is the ringing of the cathedral bells all night (once every 15 minutes then 1-12 times on the hour, depending on the time). Then, there are all of the people out late at night, which is fine. But, for some reason, construction would begin at 5:00am and deliveries and garbage collection happened throughout the night. Also, the walls are very thin, and we could hear the man in the room next to us snoring all night. Some have written to request a room off the street because it may be quieter. We thought about that and inquired after we had spent our first night - but there are no rooms off the street. The hotel is in a terrific location. You are in walking distance from just about everything (or at least close to the subway). However, it would take a lot for me to go back there. I'd rather try somewhere new when I go back to Barcelona. Unfortunately, we were there during a large conference in the city, which cause room-rates to shoot up city-wide.

The location is definately the biggest plus of this hotel. It is one block away from the Cathedral, when you come out of the hotel you walk about 5 mins (towards the right) and you are in the La Ramblas area, which is quite the happening strip at all hours of the morning. The subway is nearby and really the best way to get around town. There are a few markets nearby and well as many nice restaurants. The rooms were very clean and well kept. there is a safe in the closet, so you can keep your valuables in it. There is a small TV in the room but has a few english channels. We had a room facing the street and it was extremely noisey at night. I found it abit weird having to give the hotel staff our hotel key when we left but nothing was taken from our room, so it is just a safety thing. I found the front desk staff to be a little unfriendly, maybe they need to hire some friendly smiling females instead of having nothing but 45-55 year old men working the front desk! Anyway, I did not have to deal with them too much other than asking them for a cab and enquiring about trying to stay an extra night (I booked off the website but needed an extra day, so they gave me a rate of 80E for another night, two single beds). Overall, the location was great, with average quality rooms, what brought down my rating was the noise and unfriendly male staff!

We booked it having read the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor. We paid with bancotel vouchers which made it cheaper than normal prices. We took an airport bus to Placa de Catalunya and then walked for about 5 minutes to find the hotel. On arrival at the hotel the staff spoke English to us which was helpful because we can't speak a word of Spanish. Our double room was excellent. It had laminate flooring, modern decor and a small but nice sparkling white bathroom with loads of free toiletries and fresh towels which were all replaced every day when the room was cleaned. There was a minibar and even a TV. The only problem was CNN and Eurosport were the only English channels it had! It was a bit of a pain having to hand your room key into reception every time you left the hotel and then asking for it on return. (?for security- unsure why). The location of the hotel was great for La Ramblas and the Gothic Quarter, with loads of nice tapas bars and restaurants if you look further than the typical touristy places. We were recommended to go \"Taller del Tapas\" restaurant nearby the hotel - it was not good. The staff made several mistakes with our order and then tried to charge us for food we never had and were quite rude when we questioned them. The food was very poor value for money compared to many traditional tapas places we went to. AVOID THIS ONE! Night time was a bit noisy because (as already mentioned by many others) the hotel is on a busy side street where dustbin lorries and other working traffic continue all night. It also seems to be a walk through for a few drunken shouting people at 3am. We knew it was 3am because you can also hear the cathedral clock chiming!

There were many good restaurants close by, subway and bus connections were great, shopping was wonderful. We like to eat vegetarian and would highly recommend Juicy Jones and Organic. Both are a 5 to 10 minute walk from the hotel. Most mornings I would walk to a bakery about a block away and bring pasteries and drinks back to the room. We were able to leave excess baggage at the hotel when we were out of town for a few days. That was a real bonus. We took the city bus tours the first day, both red and blue, and it really helped us get our bearings. You get a coupon book for discounts at many attractions and we made good use of it.

I booked this hotel solely on the advice I read from the Tripadvisor website. As I have said in a review for another hotel I would not book a hotel room without consulting this website. You really cannot go wrong, you know exactly what you are going to get so you can make an informed choice. The Regencia is a three star hotel and is everything that a three star should be. It is clean and comfortable. We were given a rather large room (no. 560) on the fifth floor. This contained three beds, although only two of us travelling. The bathroom was very clean and with plenty of toiletries supplied. There is a hairdryer in the bathroom. There is a mini fridge but please bring your own kettle if you like a cuppa in the morning! The location as has been said in other reviews could not be bettered. It is situated directly behind it's 4 star sister hotel the Colon. Our room overlooked the Cathedral Square which is \"the place\" to be. Within two minutes walking distance of the Ramblas and about 5 mins from Port Vell. All in all a good stay. We booked the Bus Touristic for two days as this is the official Barcelona tour bus and stops at all the major sights. You can get on and off the bus as many times as you like. Yes you do have to keep an eye on your belongings as you should do anywhere but I never felt there were any problems. The Ramblas is a great place to walk day or evening just to see the fabulous and inspired mime artists, when you go you will see what I mean. The one downside for me was that there appears to be a real lack of decent restaurants. The fashion at the moment is tapas bars and there are simply hundreds of them. So can't say I enjoyed a really good meal. A tip though is to eat and drink along one of the side streets from the Ramblas or in the Cathedral Square. The Ramblas tapas bars seem to charge sky high prices because they are in such a popular location.
