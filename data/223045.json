It's in a bad part of Dallas, very scary! One street over and your in china town?! This place NEEDS a makeover!!!! there is only one elevator and it was a MESS and took FOREVER!! The TVs were not flat screens which is not a big deal but the picture wasn't even clear!!!! The service was HORRIBLE! During check in there was a paper on the pool windows stating it was \"closed for repairs\" but there were people swimming, the attendant Mary Ann told us it was closed but we could swim now. Later that night we asked her what time it closed and she stated it was open 24 hours as long as we were quiet. We went swimming but when we asked for towels Walter told us we couldnt have any because THATS WHY WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE SWIMMING, like its out fault because its under construction!?!?! Mary Ann told us we could? So we couldnt get towels, even though in our bathroom a sign tells you not to take your towels that some would be provided for you. OVERALL, it was horrible, the beds are not comfortable, it was messy in the hallways, the breakfast had waffles but they kept sticking to the machine because the breakfast attendants came out to spray it with the non stick spray every once in awhile, instead of leaving it out like the other places. THIS PLACE IS WAY OVERPRICED! the 3rd night we stayed at Baymont Inn and Suites same price, indoor pool and it TOPS this! Same price and it is a FULL UPGRADE, flat screens modern room. GO THERE! I left a great review! This place was a total disappointment :(", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing\u201d", "Author": "Aprincess365days", "ReviewID": "UR126062170", "Content": "I came in late and everything was comfortable from the front desk to my bed.

He pounded his fist on the desk a couple of times to try to attract attention from the adjoining office. The manager on duty appeared and began to call my husband some VERY derogatory names, told him he could just wait, he was not king. He then asked to see my husband's identification to check and make sure he was registered. When my huband handed him his driver's license, he threw it across the room and told him to get out of the hotel. My husband retireved his license and left the lobby, telling the manager that we intended to stay - that we had already paid for 2 rooms (my daughter & family were there too). As he walked away, the manager yelled that he would erase the payment from the hotel's computer.

You may not want to stay here if you don't want to expose your family to these sights. But the facilities are well maintained, everything works, and it's clean. It has everything you would expect in a hotel like this--free well-lit parking lot, free wired and wifi, free hot breakfast, a small gym, indoor pool and hot tub, free use of a computer to work and print out boarding passes. The room was spacious and clean. Furnishings were a little dated but comfortable. There is a small kitchenette with coffee maker, fridge and microwave.

It's slightly above 'average', but not quite 'very good'; rather it's a SOLID 'good' rating as I see it. Other reviews below touch on some of the more important issues related to this property. I'll try to expand upon some of the more important factors which I find of greater significance which matter to me. Location: When I'm in Dallas, I have to travel to appoinments all over Dallas. Typically from downtown -to- Park Cities -to- Plano -to- Garland -to- etc! I find this location, on the NorthWestern side of Dallas, to be very adequate in terms of it's location to the metroplex as a whole. It's right off the highway @ 35E & Walnut Hill (About 1 Mile South of 35E & 635). I give it top marks in Location. As to the 'strip clubs' noted by a previous trip advisor member... beware, there are multiple strip clubs around this hotel. I usually don't have a problem with this, but then again I stay here as a business man with no family members present. Now, I would say there are NOT \"drunken men\" hanging around this hotel as previously indicated - that's a bit misleading. In fact, I have typically found this area to be usually quiet with not problems of vagrants or drunkerds hanging around this property. I have never brought my family (wife & child) to this hotel, as I'm always here on business - but I don't think I would have a problem doing so if need be. Cleanliness: Your Mileage May Vary... However, I have stayed at this location about 15 times over the past year, and have always had clean, fresh rooms. Typically there is nothing I can complain about in terms of the overall 'cleanliness' of these rooms. HOWEVER, I will say that these rooms are not as modern as some of your more recently built Comfort Inns. So, the decor may seem a little dated to most travelers; especially if you like features like flatscreen TV's in your room or granite counter tops in the bath rooms - don't expect that here, just your basic accomodations a good price (for Dallas hotels). Some people may construe these 'dated rooms' as not being clean, but I see this as just old age and wear & tear on this slightly older hotel. I will say I have never had 'mold' or insect problems in my rooms, but again... YMMV! Service: Typical chain type hotel staff. Friendly enough, and address minimal issues as needed (i.e. requesting a CAT-5 cable, etc). However, I have never had major problems or concerns when staying here. Nothing that terrible or special in this category - just run of the mill interactions with employees on duty. Rooms: I touched base on this one above. Hotel is a bit 'older'. Probably in the neighborhood of 10-12 years old Decor is a bit dated for my personal taste. No flat screen TV's, granite counters, fancy linnens or bedding, etc. However, rooms I've stayed in are typically clean and nice... no major issues to cause concern over. Sleep Quality: Just 'ok'. Again, nothing that special, but then again not that bad - just average in this category. I did sleep good. You don't hear the highway next to the hotel, and I've always found the hotel to be very quiet during late night/sleep hours. Value: Very excellent value for a typical Dallas hotel. Rates are pretty on on ChoiceHotels.com, and I've even negotiated reasonal rates without a reservation. Other Features: They have an excellent 'breakfast' and 'happy hour' at this property. They actually make real eggs in the morning, have real sausage or beacon and even tortillas for tacos (I love me sum tacos)! They have complimentary beer (usually Miller light) and wine with finger foods around 6PM (p.s. - beer is as much as you can drink, so bottoms up)! These two features are the reason I keep comming back to this property. This really separates them from their competition as far as I'm concerned - especially for the price. Also, you are literality 5 min from 'restaurant row' at 35E & Northwest Highway - which offers multiple restaurants and bars if you need to head out for the evening. Overall: Great business hotel for the price and location.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Woodlands, Texas", "Title": "\u201cDo NOT take your family to this area!\u201d", "Author": "keris1", "ReviewID": "UR61854834", "Content": "looked ok until we turned down the street all around was strip clubs and \"massage\" parlors if that is your thing then stay here.. otherwise take your family and run! there were drunk men everywhere.. i have never seen anything like this......", "Date": "April 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cEven the rooms are big and nice in Texas\u201d", "Author": "flridagril", "ReviewID": "UR53499065", "Content": "We chose this hotel based on a review from Tripadvisor.

Despite the bad reviews I found that it was probably one of the nicest places I could have stayed on this trip. Its a very nice property with friendly staff. The room was clean and fresh. The bed was a bit hard but I am used to sleeeping on a much softer mattress, so it might be just right for most travelers. I was quite impressed with the decor, its not the run of the mill Choice Hotels decor. I found out that it was hand painted by an artist that they brought from Atlanta. This gives the hotel more of a homey feel. The lobby has a really pretty sittting area with a nice staircase to the second floor. The breakfast area is right off that. The breakfast was fantastic. They served Migas with refried beans and tortiallas. Very very good breakfast. They also had the regular cereals, breads, coffee, juices, ect. They do offer security for the property. The parking was well lit and the street fairly quiet. I would diffentantly stay again. They have a really pretty King Spa room that has a white poster bed and is done out in French Blue and white.
