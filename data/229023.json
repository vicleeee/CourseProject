I think we paid about $120us per night, it was extremely worth it. I imagine in high season it would have been much more expensive though. We stayed the week after the Venice Film Festival, and all the movie stars stay here. I was visiting a friend in a hotel in Venice, the room was like a closet, and 4x more expensive.

We did not actually see any one in the restaurant during our stay. The breakfast, however, which was included in the price was very good. Again service was impeccable and there was even a bottle of sparkling wine for whoever wanted it which we had on the morning of our anniversary. Very decadent!! We had a lovely big room on the corner of the hotel so had a view of the sea and the garden. There is a pool in the grounds but it was closed and we did not have time to use it anyway. The room was clean and bright with pieces of furniture which matched the character of the hotel. Anyone who likes original charm will love this hotel. The hotel has a mini bus which takes you to their sister hotel, The Excelsior, from which they run a boat over to Venice. All gratis. Would suggest you get there early as it can get busy. We had a messy end to our trip courtesy of Alitalia which included delays, canceled flight and then lost luggage. Not good at all.

We had a terrific view from the sea front rooms, but the water was kind of nasty with things floating around. I'd recommend to anyone and would love to visit again.

When traveling with children, Des Bains is the best alternative if you want to both go swimming, as well as sightseeing in Venice. The Lido location implies that it takes you 30 minutes to get downtown. There is a bus shuttle to the sister hotel Excelsior, connecting to a water shuttle downtown every half hour. Both are free for guests, and are anyhow more comfortable that crowded public transport. So this is not for those who want to make Venice in a day or two, but rather for the more relaxed schedule. And Des Bains is definitively a lot more relaxing than the hectic downtown. The hotel got \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downgraded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from a Westin to a Sheraton in 2007, probably a more truthful classification. The hotel is around hundred years old; you should decide for yourself whether you would classify this as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153charm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Most things have definitively been modernized throughout the years, but you will experience quirking floors and doors that does not fit snugly. The air-condition is also substandard. We were staying during a very hot period (around 34 Celsius outside), and the room temperature would not go below 25 even with AC set to max cooling. Apart from this, we found everything to be of high standard. The rooms and bathrooms are clean and well maintained. We had an extra spacious room, accommodating two adults + two children, will still a lot of space for a desk, drawer, and lounge chairs. Sea view rooms are more expensive, but worth it if you are on a floor that would overlook the trees in the garden (3rd floor and upwards). The breakfast buffet had a good selection of cold cuts, cheese, cereals, fruits and pastries. There are also a limited number of hot dishes, mostly scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages and mushrooms. Additional items (like boiled eggs) can be obtained from the waiters, although they do not advertise this. For lunch there are two alternatives by the pool, either an outdoor restaurant, or the pool bar. The bar has more snack-like meals like sandwiches and hamburgers (around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20), while the restaurant has larger dishes and a buffet (around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac35). The dinner restaurant is also rather expensive (starters \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25, main dishes \u00e2\u201a\u00ac35, desert \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 10, cover charge \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12), easily exceeding \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100 per person including beverage. (Even a small bottle of soft drink is charged \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.) We had half-board, and thus dined as the restaurant most days. There are only a limited number of main dishes (3 fish, 3 meat, 2 vegetarian, 3 local specialties), and no daily menu supplement. Thus we needed to repeat some selections during our stay. The food is very good though, but not better that what you should expect at those prices. For swimming, there are two options: Either the pool or the beach. The pool is very large, with depth from 1 to 3.5 meters. There is also a separate children section for non-swimmers. (We had lunch one day at the neighbor Excelsior, and their pool is only a quarter of the size). The pool is located in a park with sundeck chairs. There are also tennis courts for rental at the corner of the park. Some of the trees was in blossom during our stay, implying a lot of flowers in the pool (despite frequent cleaning during the day), that colored any white swimwear yellowish, but it washed out easily when we got home. The other alternative is the beach. Entry to the beach is at additional cost, unless you have chairs or cabins included in your room rate. Rates are from around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 for a locker, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac210 for a front row \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tucul\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The sea water is rather salt, and definitively not crystal clear. Due to the salt content, you should always shower afterwards to avoid rashes. So swimming conditions are definitively better in the pool, but there is always some extra magic in being on a beach. The staff at Des Bains is excellent. The restaurant staff is although not always able to understand English, so make sure they have understood any non-Italian order. Just around the corer of the hotel is the main street of Lidos \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downtown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area, with numerous shops and restaurants.", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cAlways quiet and charming\u201d", "Author": "French", "ReviewID": "UR8132928", "Content": "We try to go back regularly every year, since we like the atmosphere of this hotel.

We were impressed with its grandeur on first sight, and the chairs and tables on the verandah looked very inviting. Reception/concierge were very good,and we were escorted by the receptionist to our room, while the concierge took care of our bags. Our biggest disappointment was that in spite of the hotel being practically empty (it had opened for the season only 3 days before) we were given a room at the back, overlooking the garbage! It would have been no problem for the hotel to allocate us a room at the front. However, our room was spacious and well furnished; the bathroom was large and luxurious, and the walk-in wardrobe was a bonus.

The shuttle service to central Venice was wonderful! Minibus to the Excelsior, launch into Venice and the same back - we really felt we were travelling in style!

Everything in Venice is very expensive and the most economical way to get around is on the water bus that goes up and down the grand canal. WHile stayying at the hotel, there is a bus that transfers you to the Westin Excelsior and from the Excelsior, a water boat shuttle takes you to hotels near ST. Mark's Sguare where everything pretty much is. It runs about every 15 minutes which is very convenient. There is not much to do at night there accept go to the casino, which was a fun expreience..We had to pay five dollars to get in and rent a jacket for my husband.

The usual is about 90 euro for the two of you alone, no singing.. The catch with ours was that the boat would have up to six people in it.

The shuttle to the Excelsior to take the vaporetto to Venice was extremely convenient and reliable, and the vaporetto ride to Venice was picturesque and delighful, and provided the same sense, to me, of riding on the waterways of Venice so as to make a pricey gondola ride unnecessary. It was so convenient to take our car on the ferry and drive right up to the hotel and have the bellman take our luggage, that next time I return to Venice, I will again stay on Lido at the DesBain in order to avoid dealing with the struggle of toting the luggage through Venice, which I saw so many tourists deal with. (Parking was free, a pleasant surprise.) I cannot imagine staying anywhere else in Venice.... The beach was magnificent and we splurged (100 Euros) and rented a lovely cabana in the first row on the beach. Even though we come from a beach town, the day we spent on Lido was the best of the trip. The beach and facilities were wonderful (and immaculate). The concierge service at the hotel was excellent. A note about a side rip to Murano The concierge was very willing to arrange for a boat to meet us at the Excelsior to take us to Murano (it was there by the time we got to the Excelsior five minutes later, even though he called for it just as we were leaving DesBains)! While it was fascinating to see the beautiful Murano glass being made and the spectacular showrooms, the prices are so over the top that you have to be crazy to make any substantial purchases. As an example, the lovely little Murano glass heart pendants with a black rubber necklace, which you can buy all days long at kiosks and shops in Venice for 5 Euros, sold for 40 Euros at the glass factory! They looked the same, and I cannot imagine any difference in quality to justify the exorbitant prices. A salesperson is assigned to you upon arrival at the factory and escorts you throughout the showrooms.. Even though we knew we were getting ripped off as we were doing it, I am embarrassed to say we spent several hundred dollars that I regretted by the time I got on the boat to return (As a consolation, we did pick up lovely, unique pieces that I did not see in shops in Venice). By the way, as prompt as they were about picking us up, we waited quite a while for the return boat- the driver took time to eat a full lunch while we waited. Bottom line- it is very interesting to see the glass being made, but unless you are confident that you are completely immune to high pressure sales tactics or have money to burn, approach Murano with caution. You may wind up spending more time than you wanted to (and money) taking this little excursion.", "Date": "June 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, VA", "Title": "\u201cVery 'belle epoch' feel\u201d", "Author": "NadirAhmad", "ReviewID": "UR5079119", "Content": "Very classy and historic hotel in the Lido.

The vaporetto is a scenic 10 minute walk away, and the hotel also has a shuttle service to take you into Venice. The beach is literally on your doorstep.

Sure, it's not refurbished to look like every other corporate hotel of the early 21st century - and it has some creaky floorboards. But what it has above everything is great charm: it's a relaxing and pleasant place to stay. On the plus side: great pool, lovely gardens and immaculate terrace. Housekeeping is of a very high standard and the hotel was clean and a nice environment. The concierges are brilliant. Air conditioning worked plenty good enough for me. On the minus side: Breakfast is good quality but can be a bit of a bun-fight (almost literally) when the hotel is full. Some of the waiting staff lack the charm of the rest of the hotel's employees. But it gets back to a '5' overall because the restaurant food is delicious in what is a bit of a Lido culinary desert: the other local eateries are cheap and convenient, but don't really break out of the Tourist Menu syndrome that becomes depressing after a while. Overall, though, it's a wonderful cosmopolitan multi-lingual place with enough of its Bohemian past to keep it interesting.", "Date": "August 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay at Hotel Des Bains\u201d", "Author": "Stanwich405", "ReviewID": "UR3750253", "Content": "I read and re-read the reviews of this hotel many times while planning our trip to Italy. Because Hotel Des Bains is part of the Starwood group (Sheraton hotels), I was interested in staying here so that I could use our Starwood Points. We had two rooms, next to each other, facing the water. Both rooms were large with good size bathrooms. Having stayed at the Rome Hilton Cavelieri and Westin Excelsior in Florence prior to our arrival in Venice, we were a bit spoiled. Both of the previous hotels are beautiful. The Des Bains though did not disappoint us - I would definitely stay here again. The rooms were clean, the staff was nice. We didn't have time to use the pool but it looked beautiful. We did sit on the beach for a couple of hours and the water was clean, warm and delightful. We did not have breakfast included in our rate so I can't comment on that. However, one night we ate at the Pagoda Restaurant which is both of the hotel (across the street, overlooking the water). The food was different and delicious. Another evening we ate at a local restaurant on the island, it was very good, be sure to ask the concierge for suggestions. As far as the shuttles, this is was something I was worried about and wondered if it would be inconvenient. I thought it was great - a shuttle left every 1/2 hour to the Excelsior and then we boarded a shuttle boat immediately. The ride was very quick, 15 minutes or so and was a welcome relief to the hot, humid weather. It dropped us off at a very convenient location. It was not hard to plan your day or evening around the return shuttle times. They were always very prompt and easy to use. I was pleasantly surprised. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others, it's a great place to go if you have kids especially due to the pool and large size of the rooms.", "Date": "August 9, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Des Bains, Venice Lido Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d229023-Reviews-Hotel_Des_Bains_Venice_Lido_Resort-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$466 - $974*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Lungomare Marconi 17</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30126</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "229023", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/14/09/14092663068370d38dae56a1e48601292large.jpg"}}
