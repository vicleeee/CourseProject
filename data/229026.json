When we entered the room, there was a really weird smell coming from the furniture and the carpet (that reminded me of my grand-mothers home), however after leaving the window open for a few hours every day, we could not notice it after a couple of days. The room was quite small but warm (temperature), the bathroom was the best place as it was rennovated and clean. The matrices were quite old and a bit uncomfortable for a 3 star hotel. We had clean towels every day and room service was great. I have to say though, that it was quite noisy since the cleaning would start around 8 from the corridors, using hoover that was walking us up. Our breakfast contained only a few things and the quantintes were not always sufficient so if we would go after 9,30, we could not find enough a couple of the days we stayed. All in all, it did not meet our expectations for its price but perhaps. Have in mind the extra charge of 2euros per person per night that is in force for tourists in Italy: although we had pre-paid the hotel, this was not included and the receptionist did not informed us during checking but at the check out!

Nothing to get to excited about, but nothing was mentioned when I booked the room through the hotels website nor at check in so thought that was a little inconsiderate.

Had a look at this area when there and really glad we did not choose this area. If you like noise,bizz and generally 'tatty' surroundings this is the place to be!. The Hotel Diplomatic is located on the opposite bank of city center, near the Vatican. It is about a 10 minute stroll to the Spanish steps. The beauty of the hotel location is that it is out of the tourist areas but easily accessable for all attractions. The furthest is the Colloseum which is approx 20mins by bus from outside the hotel. Bus tickets are purchased from the cafe/tobacconist at the stop for 1 euro each. They must be time stamped on the bus and this allows 75 mins travel. The standard of the hotel was more than adeqate. We booked a double room and were very pleased with a front facing room with small balcony. I would suggest requesting this if possible as rear rooms would look into other buildings.Our room was small but very well appointed. Aircon worked! Clean laundry. LCD TV (though not a good selection of cannels!). Bathroon was all marble with wet shower. A small reception with friendly staff, lift to all floors,internet avilable at 1 euro for 1hr. Breakfast served in pleasant surroundings looking on to patio area with tables & chairs (although surrounded by high buildings). Buffet breakfast which was more than expected. Cereal, meat, cheese, rolls, bread ( & toaster), fruit cocktail,youghurts, croissants, tea, coffee etc. Fill up and this keeps you going for most of the day. There are a number of restaurants situated locally. Note; there is a Fiumicino airport bus stop in Piazza Cavour 50yds from the hotel running every hour charging 8 euros p.p. We used it and it works!

That being said, when we arrived the front desk staff was curt and unhelpful. We had just finished an at least twelve hour trip and though we were exhausted we wanted to start sight seeing. We asked the front desk staff what would be the best way to get to the Old Synagogue, and wanted to walk. When it appeared that he did not know what we were talking about we gave him the address we were looking for. We were told it was way too far to walk. We told him that we were okay walking a couple of miles, it was a beautiful day and we had been on a plane for a long time. He basically refused to give us any directions. So, we just left, and after walking around for a couple of hours we found what we were looking for. On the second day we asked how to go about getting onto the internet. We were given a code and went up to the consoles. The code did not work. We went down to the front desk and were told that we did not put it in right. - though he never asked how we entered it. He reprinted the code, but this time it was illegible. When I asked if he could discern what the last number or two were he looked at me and rolled his eyes. We went upstairs to try to enter the code again and it still was not working. So, we went back downstairs and told him it still was not working. At this point he got rude and snippy and told us that we obviously didn't know what we were doing. I told him exactly how we were putting the code into the computer and asked him if that were correct to which I got another roll of his eyes. At this point he gave us another code and we tried it again. When it STILL didn't work I went downstairs told him it didn't work and said that we wanted our money back - which he obliged. However, he repeatedly stated that we must have been doing something wrong with the code and each piece of paper was incredibly difficult to read as there was no ink in the printer. The next morning my husband asked about the internet service and we were informed that it was down and had been down since yesterday. Aha we thought. Anyway, some of the other front desk staff were \"okay\" but in general the customer service was quite lacking in this establishment. I was very disappointed as I had read about the hotel on Trip Advisor before we booked, and had not read this in any of the reviews.

Not sure if I should be grateful for having one because most bars/restaurants in Rome were missing them. Breakfast was nice 6:30am-10:30 with rolls, croissants, cereals, yogurts and cheeses and ham. Get there early because after 9:15am things run out and you\u2019re only left with cereals and toast. From FCO airport we were going to take the train for 11 euro per person to Termini but opted to take the mini bus service offered by the information desk near the train platform for 15 euro/person. Found it a little odd that they wrote 7euro on the front main of the receipt and 30euro on the back. Once at the hotel your very central to everything and will walk mostly the main sights. 87 bus outside the hotel takes you directly to the coliseum if you don\u2019t want to walk or back.

So we opted to take the number 70 bus to termini which stopped about 1 block away. You can\u2019t buy the ticket on this bus so buy it before hand. Next trying to buy a Leonardo Express ticket was a bit deceptive because on the train platform the machine only seemed to support Italian language but one guy approached us I tried to sell us his tickets for the same price, pretending he had vocal cord problems. Hesitant at first, I agreed as I watched others buy tickets from him and the train was due to depart in a couple of minutes. He validated the ticket for me but afterwards I noticed that the ticket had a timestamp of 9:15 when I was indeed travelling around 4:52pm. Thought we had got ripped off I reluctantly got onboard and handed the ticket to the inspector. He seemed to hesitate but then just stamped the ticket as valid. Not sure if he saw we had been had and as gesture of good will never said anything or the ticket was indeed valid. Phew! Rome is very expensive with the poor exchange rate to the \u00a3. Can of coke can cost up to 5 euros in some places. If you\u2019re interested in buying those fake handbags being sold near some of the tourist attractions then we managed to pick then up for 12-14 euros when the initial price quoted was 45 euro.

Also, even from up on the 5th floor with the windows and shutters shut, there was still plenty of noise from the traffic below during the night. Nothing that bothered me but I imagine if you were lower down, it might be more of a problem. No, what bothered me more was the extremely thin walls. If there was someone in the room next to you, you knew about it. I think it was perhaps the air conditioning system too, all the rooms connected, meaning that if someone spoke in the room next to you, you could hear it pretty clearly where you were.

The venue is excellent - just a 10 minute walk across the river to the Spanish Steps and the centre of town, plus a lovely 5-10 minute walk along the river to the Castel Sant'Angelo and St Peters. The hotel itself is exactly what I was looking for in a good three star hotel, if not more. The rooms were clean, the beds comfortable, the bathroom a good size and the mini-bar is the type of small fridge which you can put your own water / wine in. The wardrobe is a good size and there are real hangers which you can actually remove from the wardrobe - result! Some people have complained about the air conditioning, and having just spent four days in Rome when it was 42 degrees, I agree that it's not the best air-con system but it's perfectly adequate. If I can survive in these temperatures then I'm sure everyone else can. Just keep the shutters down during the day and keep the air con up and the room will be a lovely temperature at the end of the day. On a positive note, the fact that the air-con is not heavy duty means that you don't wake up in the middle of the night with a dry, scratchy throat. The complimentary breakfast is simple but perfectly good - especially the ciambellone - with a selection of breads, pastries, cheeses, hams, yoghurts, fruit, cereals and hot and cold drinks. I expecially like having breakfast outdoors on the terrace under the canopies - a lovely way to start the day. The staff is also excellent - very friendly, remembered our names, and booked a car for us for our return journey to the airport. At only 5 euros more than a standard taxi, it was nice to have a lovely air-conditioned mercedes to give us a relaxing return journey - I would definitely recommend you take up this service. The hotel is very reasonably priced at approx \u00a360-70 per night (particularly when you consider that it includes breakfast) so I would totally recommend this hotel to everyone - I am delighted with it and will definitely return.", "Date": "July 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood location, good rooms, good breakfast.\u201d", "Author": "Jeff_and_Dianne", "ReviewID": "UR32566054", "Content": "This is a basic, no frills hotel.

Well, I put the paper in my pocket and kept walking. When I got to the hotel that I was staying in, (Holiday Inn), I was very disappointed and after one night there I decided to try another hotel. So I found the hotel flyer that the guy at the airport had given me and called Hotel Diplomatic. The price was way less than I was paying at the Holiday Inn, so I decided to give it a try. Everyone was so nice and helpful. I fell in love with the hotel due to the location and how convenient it was to everything, not to mention the price. The rooms are a nice size for Europe, even though the bathrooms are a little on the small side. So here I am twelve years later and still enjoying Hotel Diplomatic's quaint coziness.

We arrived early (11:30 ish) and so in fairness hadn't expected to be able to check in. The reception desk were extremely helpful and allowed us to store our luggage until the rooms were ready. We were told that there would be about a 20min wait and so we decided to take a walk around to get our bearings. The receptionist very kindly provided us with a map and the address of the hotel so that we would be able to relocate it! We had a twin room (106) both the room and the ensuite were much larger than expected. The room itself came equipped with a stocked mini bar (prices same as in the local shops) TV (although only CNN is in English!) and possibly the best air conditioning ever experienced ! (something much appreciated in the 35 degree August heat) Breakfast was good consisting of toast, cereals, pastries, yoghurts and fruit. The rooms were made up daily and the towels were changed at the same time. After about 5pm the road outside is empty and so you experience no disturbance from the traffic. We stayed 4 nights and had a very enjoyable stay I couldn't find fault in anything. I would definitly recommend the Hotel Diplomatic. Top Tips- * Pre book excursions to the Vatican/Colosseum the queues are huge I used www.myvaticantour.com who offer several others. The guides speak excellent English and you are provided with headphones so that you can hear through the crowds. * Buy a Tour Bus and Boat ticket. These can be purchased from either onboard the bus or at one of their kiosks. They are valid for 24 or 48hrs and are a great way to see the sights. You can hop on or off at any of the designated stops * Take Bus 87 to the Colosseum it stops right outside. Tickets can be purchased for 1 EUR from any Tabacchi but are only valid for 75 minutes. Be warned, trying to get a bus back is a little less simple as none seem to head in the right direction (this is where the above tour bus comes in handy as buses come every 15mins) * Try to eat away from the main attractions. The side roads just along from the Spanish Steps are very reasonable with a meal and soft drinks costing approx 22 Euros (this is in comparison to a restaurant near the Vatican which charged 45 Euros for practically the same)", "Date": "August 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery convenient location\u201d", "Author": "Headabove", "ReviewID": "UR18086601", "Content": "Stayed from 12-15th July 2008.

As far as restaurants in the area are concerned, Pizzeria Roma is OK, Vito's seems a bit overpriced and definitely catering for tourists...

The front desk staff speak perfect English and Claudio in particular is wonderful, keen to debate football, roman history and the opinions of his grandmother, he entertained us whilst we waited for the excellent door to door tours he arranged for us with Carrani Tours (we took these for ease because of the scorching heat). I can thoroughly recommend this hotel. We did however arrive during a taxi drivers strike (it was never clear why they chose to randomly take strike action) which made us use public transport from the start as we had intended to take a taxi from Ciampino until we were familiar with the public transportation system. It was probably a blessing because once we had the route to the Diplomatic clear it was very easy. Bearing in mind a taxi from the airport is E48 and during the taxi strike rebel taxis are/were holding people to ransom and charging double the normal fares. This is how to do it - There are numerous coaches from the airport into Termini charging E6 one way and E10 return to Termini (incl Easyjet). At the airport or Termini buy a day ticket for E4 which will allow you to travel on buses, trams and metro. At Termini you can then take either the no 70 bus directly to the hotel or take the metro A line to Lapanto and walk down Via M A Colonna to the Diplomatic. There are nine buses which stop outside this hotel, the 70, 78, 81, 87, 186, 224, 492, 913, 926 which are available on the public transport ticket and a hop-on-hop-off private trambus no 110. Having mastered this we refused to use taxis at all on principle and toured Rome by public transport. Wherever we ended up as we walked about Rome we simply looked at one of the many bus stops and we were guaranteed a bus to get us back to the hotel.

The staff were pleasant & the breakfast simple but with all the places to eat in Rome you should'nt go hungry. We only had one problem which was on our first night there. After a long day of travelling and seeing the sights all we wanted to do was to go to sleep & wake up refreshed for the next day....In our room we shared an adjoining door with the other room which was not good lets just say that the couple next door were a gay couple and we could hear everything that was going on as clear as day. We were tired & did'nt want to listen to that so my husband went down to see the guy on reception who basically said that there was nothing he could do that the hotel was fully booked up & that we would have to wait until tomorrow & that if the noises carried on to knock on the other rooms door!!! The noises got worse so we went down again. My husband told the guy on reception that we can't stand to listen to that & asked him if he could move us to another hotel if they could'nt accomodate us here. With that the receptionist changed his tune and said that there was a room but it was a suite and that we would have to pay for it - my husband told him why should we pay for something that is'nt our fault after abit of a debate he said we could stay there for the night & that they would put us in another room tomorrow which was fine by us. After that we had no problems. For our first visit to Rome it was a good one yes the hotel was ok.

We were initially told that we would be accomodated at another of the group's hotels across town (and were supposed to be comforted by the fact that they would cover the cab fare). This was not ok. We picked the hotel because of the location and were quite upset. After a bit of arguing the concierge finally changed his tune and admitted that there was one room left, but it was a suite and he would have to get special permission to give it to us and we would have to move out \"immediately\" the next morning. After verfying with his boss that he could infact give a room to a couple who had reserved a room (seems like common sense to me) he took our passports and our reservation confirmation and refused to give it back to us until the next morning. we politely explained that we would be happy to wait for him to copy down our passport information--no rush, but we'd prefer to just wait and get them back--and we at least wanted a copy of our reservation seeing as it was the only thing we had to prove that we had a reservation at this hotel that had given away our room. He started yelling at us and saying that it wasnt America and this wasnt how things worked and we needed to \"hit the road and travel a bit\" (funny...since we had been in 6 countries in the previous 2 weeks...). Though he finally gave us our passports back, he refused to give us our reservation confirmation sheet and when we said we felt more comfortable keeping it, he grabbed the key out of the valet's hand and said \"Well i will not give you a room then.

As far as I could ascertain there were no other public rooms in this 'hotel'. My room on the first foor was a relatively small twin bedded room, clean with a comfortable bed and good linen, tv in the bedroom showing only Italian channels. The bathroom, though small, was very clean with an excellent shower and clean towels daily. The airconditioning on the first night was excellent but sadly failed on day two of my stay. The hotel was without airconditioning on both the second and third nights and was somewhat restored by the fourth night although it was very poor. The electricity failed due to an internal fault on the third day leaving the hotel without power for some hours. Breakfast was fairly basic and adequate with one disturbing factor. There is a refrigerated display but the staff chose to stock this with tinned fruit and yogarts leaving the cold meats and cheese lying on a table next to it, except for day 3 of my stay when the meats were in the refrigerated cabinet. Given that breakfast service begins at 6.00 am and continues until 10.00 am I didn't risk eating the cold meats at 9.45 am when they looked a little 'tired' to say the least. The breakfat staff were very polite and helpful. The furniture on the terrace is somewhat worn and chipped with large chunks of melamine missing from the table tops, hardly hygenic in a food service area. The hotel was in a great location for sightseeing 15-20 mins walk from all the major attractions. The desk staff were all extremely pleasant and helpful although there can be a problem with late night entry. On my first evening I arrived back at the hotel to discover a notice on the door saying 'Will be back shortly'. Some twenty minutes later the night porter appeared apologising saying that he had been doing 'room service'.
