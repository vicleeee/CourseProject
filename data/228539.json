For the most part, it was fine. We had a family room, which consisted of a double bed and bunk beds in the room. The room itself was a good sized room, with a modern bathroom, and a balcony of sorts. There was air conditioning in the room, that worked very well indeed. In terms of drinking and dining, there was a garden bar, where we sat and had a drink. It was pleasant but for the few annoying wasps. We didn't have dinner in the hotel, and to be honest, i'm not sure the restaurant was open for dinner as there were rennovations being carried out during our stay. Breakfast was included in the price of the room and it was very good actually - a mix of hot and cold items - the usual things: cereals, yoghurts, pastries, sausages, eggs, bacon, cheese, cold meats, breads, tea, coffee, juice etc. It is a bit of a strange area by the airport so there weren't a lot of restaurants nearby to eat at in the evening we were there, but we did find one (the name of which I cannot remember, but it was about 5 mins walk from the hotel. The name of it translated roughly into something like 'happy times') and had pleasant enough food, including a full children's menu, which was great. There was no pool, which was a shame as the kids would have loved a swim - but again, it was only for one night. They offer a free shuttle bus to and from the airport - and it's a regular, reliable service.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seville, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay close to Bajares Airport in Madrid\u201d", "Author": "Julian S", "ReviewID": "UR138864026", "Content": "In order to connect from the Sevilla-Madrid AVE high speed-train from Sevilla to my flight to Baltimore, I had to spend the night in Madrid close to the airport, as i have done before.

The airport shuttle service was efficient and operated more hours than some of the other hotels near-by.

There is a free shuttle bus from the airport which was handy but we were told we had to call the hotel first - I think Reception may sometimes need to prompt the driver that someone is waiting! But it only took 10 minutes to arrive and around 5 mins to take us to the hotel. Although near the airport we heard no noise at all from aircraft. In fact the room was very quiet - couldn't hear our neighbours at all! We had a standard room but I believe there are different types - some even had gym equipment in! The standard rooms are reasonably spacious with a very nice bathroom (full bath and shower, wash basin/vanity unit, toilet and bidet). There is a free safe and good size TV but we could only find one English speaking channel - BBC World News. Not a great deal of drawer space but adequate. You can tell the hotel is more geared to business travellers than tourists. We were told there would be tea and coffee in the room but there wasn't. We asked at Reception and they promised to sort it but nothing materialised. We also asked them to check the air conditioning as we couldn't adjust it but again nothing happened [it reached 43 degrees whilst we were in Madrid so we wanted it turned up!] On a more positive note when we arrived one of the wardrobe doors was jammed meaning we couldn't access the safe - Reception sent a man up straight away who fixed that problem there and then. The beds were comfortable but we found the hollow fibre pillows uncomfortable. Also whilst there was a spacious balcony there was no furniture which was a disappointment - none of the other rooms had patio furniture either which we found strange. We'd booked for breakfast each morning which we were told by the booking agent was continental but as well as the usual cold meats, salamis, cheeses etc there were also fried, boiled and scrambled eggs, bacon (albeit Spanish style), sausages and mushrooms. Plus there was a nice selection of fruit, cereals, yogurts, pastries, cakes and even churros with chocolate sauce. We didn't eat any other meals at the hotel but we did notice they offered a variety of evening meals including a range of tapas for a rvery easonable price. The main issue for us was the distance the hotel was from the centre of Madrid. We found the easiest and quickest way into central Madrid (the 'Sol' district) is by the Metro although there did also seem to be a lot of buses about too. The nearest Metro station is about a 20 minute walk away (Barajas Station). The Metro system is very cheap and there are plenty of free maps to help you. It's similar to the London underground with colour coded numbered lines. The Barajas station has a ticket office so just tell them the station you want and they will give you the ticket. The Metro is very spacious, clean and efficient. It takes 2 trains to get to the centre of Madrid roughly 30 minutes travelling, possibly 3 trains if going farther afield but you never have to wait more than a couple of minutes for any connection. It also appeared very safe from what we saw. Nor was it overcrowded but as we were there in July it's possible many spanish were on holiday themselves. In summary, the hotel was ok apart from a few niggles but I dpon't recommend it if you're wanting to explore the city. Get a hotel nearer the centre.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cnice rooms, good food overall pleasantly surprised\u201d", "Author": "Pheephox", "ReviewID": "UR135023625", "Content": "was put up here by the airline when missing flight connection and very pleasantly surprised.

In my books a good airport hotel needs to offer only three virtues: close to the airport, frequent airport shuttle, clean rooms - everything else is a bonus. I ended up in this hotel after missing my flight connection and was subsequently \"assigned\" to this hotel by Iberia. Upon leaving the airport building, the shuttle was waiting for passengers and got us to our destination in a quick and efficient manner. Check on one of my virtues. The front desk staff didn't speak a lot, a quiet, kind of slow chap, who got the job done. An ok experience. The room was surprisingly large, well equipped, decent TV and more importantly free wifi internet in the room. I was pleasantly surprised that there was no aircraft noise at all in this location and that is a real boon for an airport hotel. The bathroom was a good size and very clean, as was the rest of the room. Check on the second one of my virtues. If you venture outside the hotel you'll find a bunch of small bars, a supermarkets and more all in very easy walking distance, so you don't need to feel locked up. The airline had paid for dinner and breakfast, so I \"enjoyed\" both meals. While dinner left me wanting, breakfast was wonderful with a very good selection. I am not sure I would have been happy to pay for dinner (average), but breakfast would have been a decent investment (above average for Spain, I'd say). When I was ready to leave at 7am the shuttle was yet again waiting for passengers and got me to the airport. Check on the last of my three virtues. So my key requirements were fulfilled very well: easy transport to and from the airport, just about 5-10 minutes by shuttle bus reasonably large, clean and comfortable rooms without aircraft noise a good night's sleep, decent breakfast Even though I didn't pay for this hotel myself, I would have been happy to pay for it.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sevilla Spanien", "Title": "\u201cMy favorit Airport hotel in Madrid\u201d", "Author": "Hans-Germany", "ReviewID": "UR131064155", "Content": "This hotel is my favorit Airport hotel at Madrid Barajas.

I arrived on a Sunday night, quick checkin, despite quite a few people standing in line. Walking up to my room, I was not too impressed.

Big bed, big TV, adequately sized desk that allowed for some work, a balcony and a well groomed bathroom. On the downside of this hotel: no wifi in the rooms (but you can get an ethernet cable at the reception, and there is WiFi in and near the bar-area). The restaurant is clearly designed to move the masses: generally a buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner, quite a nice selection of dishes, but not of the quality that would make you come especially for eating there. There is also a small, clean, fitness room with three or four machines. In short: this hotel was efficient in trying to get done what had to be done, with few staff. I slept well, it was actually very quiet at night. The hotel is perhaps a 10 minute walk from the subway station, and there is regular free shuttle service to and from the airport.

Like others, we stayed here because of an early-morning outbound flight from MAD. The hotel is a bit hard to find because of some major freeway interchange construction. The parking is adequate, but can get crowded late at night. The lobby is bright, modern, and clean. There is a swanky bar area and a large business-y/lounge area for relaxing (and in Europe, smoking). The front desk staff was adequate and professional. They apologized when we called down for an extra towel and brought it up within 20 minutes. They speak some English, though not a lot. This is Spain, after all. In-room internet is reasonable at 6 \u20ac for 24 hours - but it is not Wi Fi. The rooms are clean and modern. The bathroom was full of marble and chrome; very clean and of a good size. There was just a hint of noise from the street below, but not enough to bother us. Room service from the restaurant, as well as from a Telepizza franchise is available - the food from both sources was only mediocre. The restaurant was adequate. They have a dinner buffet for 25 \u20ac which was too pricey for me. I had a few appetizers and then ordered a pizza to the room. I found the overall quality of accomodations to be similar to a Hampton Inn - plenty enough for my last night before flying home. Not sure why all the negative reviews. As I said, the Tryp must have been recently renovated because it is clean and sharp throughout the interior (much better than the cell block lock of the oexterior).", "Date": "November 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201c1 Star Service at a 4Star Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5292311", "Content": "I was traveling through Spain with family and returned to Madrid the day before our flight home. As our flight was at 6 am, we booked a room at the Tryp Alameda near Barajas Airport. The hotel website says that they have a 24 hour shuttle to the airport and most hotels don't even start running their shuttles until 6 am. When we checked into the hotel, we were greeted by an extraordinarily rude desk clerk, who gave one word responses to my questions about arranging the shuttle. I kept at it, though, and eventually discerned that she would not arrange the shuttle for me - I must come down to the desk in the middle of the night and ask the night desk clerk to call the shuttle. Then I would have to wait in the lobby until it arrived. I could not get a good idea from her about how much time I needed to allow for the shuttle to arrive once called, so we decided to be downstairs by 3:30 am in order to be at the airport by 4:30. The room was nice enough, but the attention to detail was lacking. As an example, although the room was generally clean, the edges of the tub had mildew. There was no bath mat or wash cloth. There was no shampoo, only the shower gel. There is a speaker for the TV in the bathroom, which was nice, but the amenities weren't what you would expect from a 4 star hotel. We settled in to repack all of our belongings and try to figure out how to bring home all the things we had bought during our trip. The hotel has a restaurant that opens for dinner at 8:30 pm, but as our flight was so early, we wanted to have an early dinner and nap until 3 am or so. The room had a card for Telepizza, which says orders are delivered directly to your room, generally within 30 minutes, and can be billed to your room. That was exactly what we needed. The instructions said the front desk would place the order, so we called at 6:30 pm. A different desk clerk told us to call back after 8 pm or go to the Telepizza location in person. He said they would not take hotel orders before 8:00. So we called back at 8 pm and placed our order with the desk clerk. He said he would call it in and it should arrive in about 30 minutes. About 90 minutes later, we called back and the female desk clerk who had handled our check in answered. We asked if there was a problem with our order. She said we would have to wait a half hour. We explained that we had already waited an hour and a half. She said she would have someone call in our order now and we would have to wait a half hour for it to arrive. There was no apology for not having called in our order to begin with, just attitude when we told her not to bother at that point. We were not filled with confidence about having the shuttle in time for our flight. We were so angry at the rude treatment we were receiving at this supposed 4 star hotel that we refused to spend our money in their restaurant. We walked around the residential neighborhood and did find a small restaurant to have dinner. Back in our room, we tried to watch television for a while, but could not find channels that didn't freeze up and say there was a problem with the signal. When 3 am rolled around, we got up and brought all of our luggage downstairs to request the shuttle. Yet another rude desk clerk checked us out and we made sure to hear him call for the shuttle. The bus arrived quickly, but we were left to load our own bags. The driver dropped another passenger at terminal 4 and tried to get us to get out as well, although we had told him terminal 1. He did take us to our terminal, although it was an impossibly long trip from terminal 4 to terminal 1. When we arrived, he opened the back door and let us take out one of our own bags. The other one he grabbed and dropped on the ground without so much as a glance in our direction. Then he just turned his back on us and left. All in all, the convenience of the airport location and the 24 hour shuttle made our stay there necessary, and the room itself was nice. But those things are not enough to overcome the incredibly rude treatment by the hotel staff. In the same situation again, I would rather sleep in the airport terminal than stay in that hotel.", "Date": "June 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lima, Peru", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel with bad front staff\u201d", "Author": "life43", "ReviewID": "UR4128865", "Content": "While travelling in Europe for a month with my daughter, we stayed in three Melia hotels. In Sevilla and Granada everything was excellent. However, the experience at the Tryp Alameda was quite different, due to the following incident: The day before our arrival I called up from Paris in order to find out what were the steps to get the shuttle service at the airport. They told me to ring up as soon as we arrived and they would send a shuttle. I did so and they asked to explain exactly the place where we would be waiting. I gave the exact location (the taxi cabs stop) as requested. After waiting for about 30 minutes, we called back again and they said not to move from we had been waiting. We saw the shuttle speeding up twice without giving us time to call it. We called to the hotel two more times and again we were told to wait at the same spot. We wanted to take a taxi but we were told that there was a shuttle stop. We went there but dindn\u00b4t find the hotel shuttle so we returned to the place. Finally, we saw the shuttle and ran with the lugagge to the shuttle stop and could take it. If we had been told there was a shuttle station we wouldn not had to wait, tired, for more than 90 minutes outside at night, without a seat. We lost precious time we could have used to rest since we were going to take a 15 hour flight early the morning after. We finally got at the hotel at around 11 pm, but what made things worse was that no one apologized or said anything about it. We felt very disappointed! Something else we didn\u00b4t like about their accomodation was that we had to carry our luggage through a 6 or 7 step stairs in our way to the lift and up in the morning before leaving the hotel. I hope those stairs will be redesigned since the hotel is being refurbished. Regarding the room, everything was great: spacious, confortable beds, cozy lights, beautiful and convenient bathroom. The toileteries were first quality. We had a good dine with very polite staff. As I have Mas Card, we had the newspaper in the morning and enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast 2 por the price of 1.

We had regular power outages all through the evening and I sat in total darkness at times for up to an hour.3. The restaurant is an absolute disgrace. The evening buffet had a hot section consisting of a few cold chicken bones. The waiter failed to turn on the heater to keep them warm. Service is \"managed\" to ensure that your stay at the table will be as brief as possible. Immediately you stand up to go for something extra the table is cleared.4. Breakfast service is again \"managed\" to get the tourists off to the airport ASAP. Only a few of the available tables are set for breakfast. This strategy ensures there will always be a line up for tables and those concerned about time will opt to head for the airport rather than wait.5.
