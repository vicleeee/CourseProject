We found the staff to be extremely helpful, providing us with city maps and writing on them so we would recognise landmarks - this was really good as Amsterdam is easy to get lost in. The staff struck a good balance between politeness and friendliness and invited us to ask them if we had any queries. This hotel is away from the main tourist squares, which is actually a good thing as this means it is quiet in the evenings, while still being only a few minutes' walk from decent bars, cafes, restaurants and coffee shops.

The location is great, but that can be said of all central Amsterdam hotels. The City is quite small and almost everything is a short walk away from wherever you are. The breakfast is nice with lots to choose from, and the rooms are a good size and clean. There are lots of English (BBC1 & ITV) French and German channels on the TV. Unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros. The hotel is generally quite shabby and very dated, certainly not a 'classic' look, more a 'we have forgotten to renovate for 30 years' look. The furniture in the dining room and communal areas are dark and depressing. Some windows are cracked and the courtyard rear of the property is quite unkempt and unpleasant if your room overlooks it (ours did). It is a great size hotel, and it could be lovely, sadly it isn't. I think the hotel is popular with the stag party crowd as in the evening there was a lot of rowdy noise that was very distracting. Generally there is quite a lot of noise from other customers. Staff are friendly enough, however when we checked in, a customer was being dealt with as there was a mix up with their reservation. I can only say the person (who I think was a manager) seemed quite off with them and quite rude. All this while there is an increasing queue of people waiting to check in and watching the whole drama. It could have been dealt with much much better. They advertise there being free Wifi, this is partly true. There is very slow basic wifi available, however the hotel must subscribe to a certain amount of free wifi as by early evening the free facility goes down and you are prompted to purchase faster wifi. This happened every night, and then you have to wait until 9am the next morning to get the free wifi again. The price of this hotel may be what attracts many people, however Amsterdam is saturated with good low cost hotels, if you shop around you can get much better value for money, much better surroundings, much better quality and much better service than the Rembrandt Classic.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gibraltar", "Title": "\u201cfantastic location, close to main attractions\u201d", "Author": "tgendorf", "ReviewID": "UR125693651", "Content": "I recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights.

When I checked in 3 employees were at the desk while 6 customers waited to check in/check out. One of them disappeared to the back room, one decided it was time to check and fill all the staplers. So after about 40 minutes, I got checked in. The room was very small, (about 1/3 of the size of most cheap chains in America) The windows were old and there was a constant breeze coming in and even with the heat cranked up, it was cold. They brought up a space heater which did the trick. The staff are very friendly. The breakfast was pretty reasonable at 8.50Euros. When the employee brought up the space heater and came to check the room out, he just used his key and came on in (even with the Do Not Disturb on the door) he never knocked or anything. I thought it was very rude and disrespectful to a guest to not at least knock first. Once you learn the hotel location, everything is a 10 minute walk, so no need to ride the trams. Even though the room was small it was clean and comfortable, and the bed was even a good night's rest. Overall I would recommend Rembrandt Classic Hotel, just don't expect American type service from the employees and don't be afraid to ask for an extra heater. (Ice is also available, but it takes about 10 minutes for an employee to get it for you.) oh, by the way, the room doors slam shut on a spring action, so it's not uncommon to hear doors slamming all day and night as people enter/exit their rooms, so if you're a light sleeper this might be a problem. When I was awake and didn't know what was going on, I just thought some kids were being disrespectful, but all of the doors seem to slam the same way. This property is not handicapped accessible.

No longer the case. I checked in after a long night of traveling and was given a room on an upper floor. Looked fine, until I went in the bathroom. Due to the sloping of the ceiling on that particular room, there was no shower- just a tub and a shower head about 2 feet off the ground. It's Europe, and that's fine- except I'm 6'1\" and had I known I was getting a room without a proper shower I'd have booked somewhere else. I politely asked the front desk if I could be changed to another room that had a full shower and was told they were entirely full. A few minutes later the attendant returned to the desk and said he found a room with a shower, albeit a single bed. That was fine with me (even though I had paid for a King room) and I went up to the room to go to bed. No sooner did I open the door did I see a sleeping, naked man in the bed in front of me. Luckily I didn't wake him or there would be another terrible review of this hotel from HIS perspective. This should have ended it- but the attendant insisted that because the room was booked through a third party, there was no getting out of paying for my stay. I quickly booked at another hotel- who would stay there after that? To this day they have not issued a refund to the third party vendor, GetaRoom.com.

This is a decent little hotel in a fantastic central location in Amsterdam for a good price. The hotel is located by a river, amongst cobblestone streets and traditional Dutch buildings. Amsterdam is an interesting city, and has a real personality of its own and is quite a pretty city. I arrived in Amsterdam by car and had no idea what problem parking was. The hotel had no parking but they offered a great solution for me: hotel staff arranged a type of valet service. A parking attendant came to pick up my car and took it to a garage outside the city. And when you want your car again, you just call and wait for about 20 minutes for them to bring it back. A brilliant solution to local parking problems! This classic Dutch building has lovely exteriors but is perhaps not in the best shape on the inside. The reception area felt a little less updated than my room, which was clean and fresh. Check-in could perhaps have been a bit more efficient. The interiors of the hotel was fairly basic North European hotel-design and perhaps not the most inspirational, but the location was great and its a fully decent hotel. My single room was on the first floor, small but not cramped, comfortable, qiuet, and had two lovely tall classic windows and a comfortable bed. Breakfast was included in the rate and was modest but sufficient. Be prepared to orient yourself in Amsterdam and bring a map and your hotel address once you leave the hotel, because its easy to get lost amongst all the waterways and roads if you have never been to Amsterdam before. Would I recommend the Rembrandt Classic Hotel? Yes. You get a small rate for an older hotel in a great location where you'd probably pay much more in other hotels.

Ridiculously awful stay\u201d", "Author": "Nicole W", "ReviewID": "UR116862736", "Content": "My friend and I are both young women in our twenties who have visited Amsterdam several times and adore the city. We are both polite and reserved, and as a result I feel the hotel took advantage and treated us terribly. Firstly, the pros: This hotel is extremely well located, the rooms are fairly clean and of a decent size (at least for the price). Cons? Where do I start? On our first night a pipe burst in our room, spewing boiling hot water- steam and smoke filled the air quickly- across our bathroom and onto our carpeted bedroom. We gathered up our belongings (we both burnt our feet and had to wear shoes), stuffed everything back in our cases and exited the room. We were hastily given a second room, and being 3 in the morning and tired we accepted, presuming we wouldn't be charged for the room, at least for that night! The next day the entire floor was without hot water. As we were to find out, however, the receptionist had made no note at all on the system that the event had ever occured. In our second room, a window smashed with such force that I presumed someone had thrown something through it. What actually happened was more to do with the fact the hotel has ill-fitting, old fashioned and paper thin glass in the windows. The windows do not stay open independently- guests are required to prop them up with chunks of wood. The wind had blown one of these devices sideways, which resulted in our window slamming shut. The pressure had smashed the entire window. Luckily, both my friend and I were not near the area at the time, as shards of glass covered the carpet and one of the beds. The hotel, having no free room, boarded up the window with a sheet of carboard. Two days (!) later, my friend and I were doing our make-up at around 2pm when, without a knock or a phone call, two men walked into our room to fix the window. Now surely this is ridiculous? We should have at least been warned or asked beforehand. Our room was not cleaned for several days, we had to ask staff for clean towels at one point. The reception also checked us out a day earlier than we had booked, and we had to have our key cards re-activated. Again, no apology. Finally, upon checkout I was agast to discover we were to be charged for all five nights of our stay. The hotel did not offer us ANY compensation- not even a free breakfast- or even an apology. When we pointed this out to the staff they appeared confused and at first seemed to deny the flood on our first night had even occured. No note was made on the system, and we had to stand arguing as polietly as we could before a manager finally confirmed the event and printed us out a short letter with his signature for our insurance. We were not given an apology at all. I also have a problem with the method the hotel used to take payment- they freeze your assets and only unfreeze the amount at the end of your stay. Furthermore they took a 50 euro desposit on my card and I had to ask for this to be cancelled, as it was not on my invoice...I study law and I am fairly certain this is illegal. I love Amsterdam and have stayed several times before, and I have never encountered such a ridiculous turn of events. Both my friend and I are young women and I am also fairly certain the hotel treated us as they did because they felt they could get away with it- if I had been travelling with my mother I am sure they would have been a lot more apologetic! We have both made seperate official complaints to the hotel's Head Office, but, surprise surprise, have yet to hear back. I doubt we will.

The room did not feel very clean, and the breakfast really basic - not worth paying 8 euros for it, there are plenty of nice little bakeries around.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Croydon", "Title": "\u201cSuperb location, friendly staff.\u201d", "Author": "CroydonDiva", "ReviewID": "UR30130518", "Content": "You really can't beat the location of this hotel.

Breakfast was great value - all you can eat including cheese, cold meats, breads, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, little fluffy pancake things, beans, salad, tea, coffee, cereal, fruit juice, etc. and the selection changes slightly every day to stop you getting bored. As eating out in Amsterdam is generally very dear, I'd recommend the hotel breakfast as a great start to the day. The staff were great. We arrived far too early to check in, but they took our luggage so we could go and explore without lugging bags around. Also, when it came to check out, although the check out times should start at 7am, we had an early flight and Reception were happy to arrange to check us out at 4.30am! And they booked our taxi to take us to the airport. We booked through Lastminute.com so don't know the exact price we paid, but it was definitely value for money overall. Twin room, canal view, warm room, and when it got a bit stuffy we could open the windows to air the room, which was lovely. The beds were really soft, and spare blankets and pillows are provided if you need them. The bathroom was really clean, with a great powerful shower and bath. It did get a bit damp because the extractor fan didn't seem to be working(?) but that was easily solved by leaving the door open. In the UK, we are used to even the most basic hotels having tea and coffee making facilities in the room, so I was disappointed not to have that as standard, but it didn't ruin my holiday experience! The maid service is exactly what you want - efficient and invisible. We never saw our maid, but the room was always spotless by the time we nipped back for an afternoon nap!

Check in was very efficient and although we were early only had to wait a few minutes for a room of our choice. Room though small was clean, comfortable and adequate for our needs. There was more outside noise during the night than we anticipated but this was my fault for requesting a canal view at the front which was only on the first floor. Reception staff were tremendously helpful throughout the stay even allowing me to use the reception computer in a vain attempt to check in our return flight on line. ( Does anyone else have repeated problems accessing the KLM website when abroad? ). The hotel is located in a pleasant residential area alongside a canal on Herengracht just minutes from Dam Square. Earlier reviews seem very mixed but then people have different standards. The hotel interior is looking tired and dated and in need of a major re-decoration and some new room curtains. Some minor irritations included the shower head fixed too low ( I am only 6ft tall) and a towel rail fitted above one end of the bath where you can hit your head when showering. We strongly disagree with earlier positive reviews about breakfast which we found to be mediocre and the choice of items very average. On our first two mornings we went down for 7.00am the official opening time and some items including fresh coffee had not been put out. Hot drinks are from a machine which I detest and causes queues when busy. On our last morning we went later and got the last clean table. Subsequently people were arriving to tables cluttered with crockery and debris and staff made no attempt to set clean tables unless specifically asked to do so. A table near us remained uncleared for the enitire duration of breakfast. We love Amsterdam but it is currently expensive for UK visitors. Great for walking and exploring, people very friendly and helpful and lots to do. It is a short season but Keukenhof is wonderful ( go by train and bus ) and if you like Indonesian cuisine go to the \"Antelope and Tiger\" ( reception will give you directions ).

All linen was spotless, pure white towels, very spacious rooms overlooking the canal, very quiet location but only a 5 minute walk to Dam Square, Anne Frank House and a Canal Bus Stop. The Canal hop and off bus is a must. Takes you to all the attractions and a very good commentary on the way. Once you buy your ticket it last until 12 noon the following day, well worth it. We had to take a trip into the Red Light District as did most tourists. As a female I have to say I did not feel threatened and saw no bad behaviour. Another must trip is the Henniken Experience. It cost about 15 Euros each but it is a fun trip with a couple of free samples of Henniken. You can email videos of yourself to friends singing or just a happy wish you were here video. Great fun!!

You can book on their own website and this was a lower price as the prices I found with the usual internet providers so it is worth checking out their own website to see what price they are offering All in all I would really recommend this hotel for location and service.", "Date": "August 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for us\u201d", "Author": "David-Sydney_Aust", "ReviewID": "UR18563285", "Content": "In the heart of it in old Amsterdam.

I researched and researched to find the best deal. I succeeded with the help of this hotel and a European internet booking company. You have to plan when you are going, since I do understand that the rates are typically much higher. I certainly cannot complain about the hotel's holiday rate. The location is superb. It is a block from one of my favorite hotels in Amsterdam and a fraction of the price. There are nice loft-like hotels that can look out onto the canal. Based on the view that our room had, we just wanted to stay and relax in our hotel after a long flight. I will say that there are definitely ways to save in getting to the hotel. First, you can take the train from Schiphol to Central Station. From there, you can take the 1,2, or 5 tram, and you will be about 3 blocks from the hotel. I was very impressed with the local transportation. Be aware that for early morning flights, you may have to walk to the Central Station. The tram does not go out before 6 am. If you do go out, go in groups of 2 or more. It is not the safest to be out in the early morning hours. The police patrol the area, but that may not always be enough. Also, it is about a 20 minute walk from the hotel to the train station. Seeing as there was so much savings and excellent accomodations, why would it not be five stars? There were two things that caused my husband and I to give it 4 stars. There are no alarm clocks and hair dryers in the rooms. Honestly, that seems fairly minimal until you take into effect - jet lag and a morning flight to our final destination. Other suggestions for improvements might be: air conditioning during the summer, affordable breakfast, more info about internet capabilities (TMobile Hot Spot) and wake up calls, and finally, better ways to keep out the colder draft. All in all, I am very impressed. The service is very good. Hopefully, next time I can give it the powerful 5 stars. Until then, I would highly recommend it. It is not luxury, but it is definitely worthwhile. Have fun in Amsterdam! The canal, inexpensive eateries, wonderful archetecture, and museums make it a place to remember.

The bathroom was a bit problematic as the ceiling in the shower was very low and quite moldy.

Book-in was quick and efficient. The room was clean and neat with extra bedclothes in the wardrobe. The bathroom, however, needed a little bit of attention. Although the room was spotlessly clean, the shower-head had only two positions- straight up or forty-five degrees down. When you turned the taps from \"tap\" to \"shower\" position, water would flow from where the hose connected to the tap block, resulting in water running along the top edge of the bath onto the floor. Once you jammed the shower-head in the upright position and put a flannel adjacent to the taps to divert the leaking water back into the bath, it wasn't so bad....so long as you stood halfway along the bath so that the spray actually hit you. Both these faults could have been fixed in two minutes by someone armed with a screwdriver and a molegrip....maybe next time. The one thing which I missed was the means to make a cup of coffee or tea ( as has been mentioned ) although the room did have a trouser-press!! Why? I've never used a trouser-press in my life and folks, I can honestly say, I never will.

A few near death experiences with cyclists outside the hotel, but you have to get used to the idea that cyclists rule the roads in Amsterdam! Price was good for Amsterdam but shop around as prices differ hugely for this hotel. I would say this hotel had an excellent location and is one of the hotels biggest assets. We were offered 3 twin rooms all on the ground floor, one next to reception which was a bit noisy in the mornings but nothing too bad. Over eager cleaning staff with Hoovers at 7.30am ! Rooms were very clean and of an average size, no in-room safe was a let down but otherwise each room was equipped with most things needed. (no tea or coffee in room, but only 1.5 euro in the bar). Our Shower curtain leaked like a sieve so we had daily moping up to do on the bathroom floor. Lots of hot water when needed. Smoking is allowed in the reception/bar area and although it did not bother me, some guests found this off putting as it got quite smokey at times and was the first thing to hit you when entering the hotel. Breakfast was a mix of American and traditional Amsterdam fair, as much as you can eat, coffee/tea was always too cold for my taste. Toaster blew up on our 1st day and never came back.. Breakfast room gets quite busy late in the mornings (9.30-10.00am) so get in early. Staff were all very friendly and helpful, although they could not direct me to an internet cafe (Amsterdam has very few Internet cafe's, business opportunity maybe ?)

Yes, there are mice in this hotel. I was there in late March, early April this year with two of my friends. Long story short, they were coming out through a hole in the wall behind a dresser. I suspect that rather than plug the holes in the wall, they just put the dresser in front of it. Whatever the case, I complained to the manager and he acknowleged the problem but didn't have another room to put us in. Instead, he offered me towels which I used to jam between the wall and the cabinet to keep the mouse from entering the room. The mouse didn't like that! He scratched and squealed for about an hour, making it impossible for me to sleep. Finally, he gave up and retreated back into his hole in the wall. Another problem I had was that the underside of my bedcover was sprinkled with nasty unidentified stains. I complained and the staff replaced them, but this should not have happened in the first place.

We chose the Rembrandt Residence Hotel based on the availability of a triple room, good location, and above average reviews on TripAdvisor. Location: The location was on Herengracht, one of the 4 original canals of Amsterdam. We could walk to anything, and only used the trams a couple of times. Dam Square and the Jordaan neighborhood were both a 5 minute walk, offering easy access to trams. The Damrak and Central station were approximately 10-15 minutes walking. The Red Light District was about 5 minutes, and about 15 minutes to Leidseplein or the Museum area. Note that the trams are a couple of blocks away, so it might be easiest to take a taxi to/from the Centraal Station if you have a lot of luggage (plus the trams are crowded and are not recommended with lots of luggage anyways). Check-In: Quick and efficient, by friendly personnel with excellent English skills (just like almost everyone else in Holland!). We were given a triple room with 3-beds, as requested. Note that Expedia had a great rate on the hotel, but we booked through the hotel's website and the rates were even better. The Room: The hotel was definitely older, and was in a few different buildings (the buildings in Amsterdam are tall and skinny, so it isn't unusual to have one \"hotel\" take up several buildings upstairs). Our room was large and spacious, and was a good size for 3 people. It also had a small table which was nice. The bathroom was pretty small though. The room had a pretty low ceiling, and you had to duck a bit to go through the door (I'm 6'2\"), but this wasn't a big deal. The worst part was that there were some large beams sticking down from the ceiling, which made the shower rather unpleasant for anyone taller than 5ft! But these were only minor inconveniences. We had a view of the canal, which was great. Unfortunately, the windows seemed pretty thin. This wasn't a big deal except during the mornings when there were workers outside. You could hear practically everything outside, and this was from the top (4th) floor. We were also right next to the housekeeping office and it was very noisy, plus we could hear lots of walking around directly above our room in the mornings (I'm not sure if there is a room up there or what, since we were supposed to be on the top floor, but either way, it was annoying hearing all the footsteps). Amenities: We did not take advantage of the breakfast or other hotel amenities. However, there were several good bakeries near the hotel, one of which gave lots of samples! Check-Out: Quick and Efficient. We opted to take a cab to the Airport because we had 3 people and lots of luggage. The hotel called a cab and it was there within 2 minutes. Conclusion: Despite the minor annoyances with this hotel, I'd probably use it again, especially if I needed a larger triple room. The location is great - right by everything, but on a quiet side street. I loved the Jordaan neighborhood, and it's easily walkable from the hotel. All other major sites can be walked easily, but you're close enough to public transport if you really want it. I'd probably take some ear plugs next time, though.", "Date": "January 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Great Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "SMainstay", "ReviewID": "UR6532598", "Content": "We stayed here after christmas for a few days to relax and enjoy Amsterdam.

Having carefully weighed up all of the hotel options in Amsterdam via Trip Advisor I chose this property, namely because it seemed excellent value for somewhere so centrally located and because I needed a wi-fi Internet connection whilst in Amsterdam (which is specifically advertised on the hotel's own website). Having reserved a room by phone (and having been told that I would be allocated a wi-fi equipped room) we checked-in only to find that no wi-fi Internet access was available at all. The first receptionist said \"it may work, it may not\". The next day a young lady on reception said \"Oh, here's a password, although I don't know much about it and it's only a trial anyway. And it normally doesn't work\", while on the 3rd day yet another employee told us it hadn't been working for over a week (which meant that when I booked, staff most likely knew it didn't work but still reserved me a room on the basis that I wanted the Internet). In the end I made a trip each day to the Swiss'otel just off Dam Square and used their wi-fi service (which is reliable and reasonably fast). The hotel itself has nicely refurbished public areas and a ground floor breakfast room which is light and airy. However, once you open the door to head towards guest rooms, the hotel shows its true age, with fixtures and fittings that have not likely been updated since the late 80s. In some areas, there's also a stale smell that pervades the air, almost as if someone has been smoking (though we were on a non-smoking floor). Our room, which overlooked a small courtyard was clean and tidy, though on the small side. The bathroom was recently re-tiled though and equipped with a decent power shower (and plenty of hot water). Although not plush, we weren't disappointed given that accommodation prices in Amsterdam are on the high side. One thing of concern though was the state of the wiring in our room. On the first night my girlfriend plugged in her hair-dryer only to find that it immediately short circuited. We took it to be just bad luck as the TV (plugged into another wall socket) worked just fine. However, when checking-out I always have a quick look under the bed just to make sure no valuables/clothing have been left behind. Naturally I was somewhat amazed to see a wiring loom under the bed, with exposed wires and a lead that seemingly connected to electrical sockets behind the headboard. Fire or shock hazard? Well, I'm no electrician, but I've stayed in hotels good and bad and that's a new one on me. Other than that, breakfast provided us with an adequate selection to choose from, although traces of shell in the scrambled egg and poor washing of plates/cutlery confirmed that improvements are needed in some areas. All, in all, bearing in mind the price and location it was still a good deal, though with the problems/niggles that we experienced, on balance, I would be unlikely to choose the Rembrandt residence again.

The bathroom was small, comprising of wc, washbasin and bath with overhead shower. There was a plentiful supply of piping hot water all day long. Towels, toiletries and bed linen were refreshed daily. Being on the top floor of a traditional canal side building, there were two wooden beams which intruded somewhat into the room space. I presume that this would be the same in all of the rooms on the top floor, but this is a part of the character of the building. Canal-side rooms have french windows which open out and overlook the charming Herengracht Canal, so, if you have the option, I recommend you request a room with a canal view.
