The room was very small and had no AC. The bathrrom was smelly and really tiny. The tiles had started gping mouldy. There is only liquid soap in the bathrrom, no shampoo or any other bathroom amenities. While checking out I saw that you can ask for some free things (bathroom amenities) at the reception desk. But there was no hint given by the receptionist when checking in. In the smoking lounge the wall paper comes off and the ashtrays are emptied but not cleaned in the morning. Breakfast offered quite a choice of different things, but was presented carelessly. Assorted cheese was heaped on a small plate and looked gross. A pot of coffee stood on the table. Service was hardly to be seen. The lady only collected the breakfast vouchers. I won't stay there again.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antwerp, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGood Price/quality ratio - gloomy area in winter\u201d", "Author": "MrLoo", "ReviewID": "UR95486928", "Content": "Stayed 3 times now in this hotel - but mainly in fall/winter. That's why i first did not recognize the website photos - whereas the room and restaurant area are correctly represented on the web - the entrance really is on a fairly gray dull street. The back to the water is only really possible in the summer Positive: Price of 80 euro including breakfast was fair Free internet works well Reasonable rooms would recommend this - but only for business Negative: Fairly dull area in winter - hotel restaurant fairly deserted I turn right out of the hotel and then right again over the bridge - crossing the road after bridge - you come to an area where there are a few pleasant bars and restaurant -cellars", "Date": "February 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cWell run and friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "JFPAmsterdam", "ReviewID": "UR28891390", "Content": "Best Western is certainly a reliable brand.

The location is outside of the centre in the south east of the city, however the S-Bahn is a 5 min walk from the hotel and provides a fast and easy route into the centre. The hotel was clean, and friendly though on the downside the bar wasn't open during the day. We would recommend this hotel for anyone wishing to visit this wonderful city who do not want to stay in the centre.
