Our door keys kept resetting themselves which meant several tips back down to reception to sort out (ok, maybe just bad luck). The thing I would definitely warn about is the car park. I consider myself a reasonably good driver and we had rented quite a small car but I found it very difficult to manoeuvre around the narrow underground car park and resorted to actually trying to reverse in as it was so difficult to get out of the small spaces.

Check in was extremely straightforward. The receptionist was so helpful and gave us lots of information about the local area. We had an inward facing room. You couldn't hear a thing from outside. Unfortunately the soundproofing between the bedrooms isn't as good but overall, it was very quiet for sleeping. The beds are two pushed together but they were roomy and spotless. The room was cleaned to a high standard every day. This hotel is not right in the centre of Barcelona, however it is only ten minutes on the train into the Ramblas. If you are travelling around anyway, then it's really no hardship. The T-10 card is exceptional value and so easy to use. The trains are frequent, clean and safe. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but there are enough cafes and two supermarkets nearby to accomodate this. To get to the hotel, look at the posting from June 2008 from another contributor, giving very extensive directions (very helpful). If you get the train from Catalunya, look for the metro sign, outside Cafe Zurich, as the FCG train sign isn't as easy to spot. If you go to Camp Nou, be prepared to queue and pay \u00a319 euro entry (we didn't want to queue so we missed it!).

The confirmatory response was impressively fast. The hotel is situated away from the city centre, but very close to a metro station which enables travel to the centre in approximately 15 minutes, and also provides access to other parts of the city. The T10 multi journey ticket recommended at check-in is very good value, with each journey costing 82.5 cents On arrival in our room we found that a leak in the washbasin had been very poorly disguised, presumeably by the cleaning staff. However, we were very quickly allocated an alternative room. The rooms were quite satisfactory, apart from being extremely hot (25 degrees). In response to our request for the air conditioning to be examined we were advised that it was not activated until slightly later in the year. We resolved the problem by opening the window in the evening and closing it at night to avoid trafiic noise, which did not disturb sleep through the close window. We ate in the hotel restaurant on one night. The menu was limited, but the service and food was excellent. Unfortunately the menu did not change during our five day stay, which influenced us to subsequently eat elsewhere. Equally we did not take advantage of breakfast which we felt to be expensive at almost 13 Euros.

We were on the second floor and the room size was reasonable. Small gripes with the double bed actually being 2 singles and with the single duvets tucked into each bed - so not too couple friendly there. Whilst we're at the negatives, another thing is that the air conditioning, we're told, is switched off for the autumn/winter months. It's completely inoperable until spring and we found our room very stuffy at first. Nothing that a slightly ajar window didn't fix. The streets are not too noisy at all and it's a very quiet residential area, so it was fine to sleep with a slightly open window. Apart from those small things, it was overall a very enjoyable stay. The location is brilliant - very safe and literally 1-2 minute walk to the station (El Puxtet on L7 underground line). If you come from the airport, the T10 ticket (similar to a carnet, it's a ticket with 10 journeys on it) works fine - you can get from the airport to the hotel in one journey (even if you change trains, the T10 only deducts once per passenger). Multiple passengers can use it (just need to feed it into the machine for each passenger to go through the gate) and costs just under 9 Euros. Incidentally, there are multiple companies that operate the underground system in Barcelona and if you swap between the companies (e.g. going from L3 to L7), then you need to use 2 separate single tickets. However, the T10 allows you to use the all the metro lines and interchange as much as you need without charging more than that one journey - so remarkable value really. If you need to return El Puxtet area from the city late at night after the trains have stopped, the N5 bus takes you from some of the main streets in the city (e.g. from Catalunya) straight up past Pl Molina, Padua and then there's a stop just before a cross-road (you'll have to look at the map/ask the driver) - and this stop is 3 minutes from the hotel. So, again, very accessible. Back to the hotel itself - there is also free wireless internet - good speeds in our rooms. There is a small supermarket near the El Puxtet station, which also has a few market stalls in that same building. If you need something small, directly opposite the hotel is a convenience store.

Our impressions? The very best. Let me explain. This hotel is situated in the St. Gervasi region, which is 5 subway stations away (line 7, station ElPutext) from placa Catalunya, which is the centre of everything if you are a tourist in Barcelona. The hotel is not a walking distance from the major attractions, so people who do not want to use the subway for some reason might find it uncomfortable. For the rest, the ElPutxet station is 3mins away from the hotel and the subway is always a good way to get accustomed to a city. Originally we booked the hotel because it came with a good price and some good comments on trip advisor. We were so lucky. During our first stay, we got a smoking room (107) on the first floor: decent size, very clean,big bathroom, sound-proof although the housekeeping room was next door. During our second stay, there was no smoking room available, so we were upgraded(!) on the 5th floor (510): very spacious room, nice view of spanish terraces, huge bathroom and also very quiet. The overall appearence of the hotel is non-pretentious and cosy. The lobby is comfortable, although not too big or fancy. On ground level, breakfast is served. It costs 13Euros/person and includes pretty much all you can usually ask in a breakfast, plus some dishes on request with no extra cost. On the ground floor, a pc with internet access is also available (2Euros/30mins). WiFi access is also available. So far, so good. All in all, Silken St Gervasi would be a decent hotel for budget travellers, which we would simply recommend. However, the stuff of this hotel makes all the difference. You can get plenty of clean rooms and hot-served breakfasts in a lot of hotels but you cannot easily get access to such friendly, kind and intelligent young people that welcome you and make you feel at home. This hotel's stuff was simply amazing. Isabel and Marc work at the reception and give hospitality a whole new meaning. They both speak excellent English (Marc also speaks great Italian), they are fast, proactive and know how to serve you right. Our check-in was fast, our check-out equally good. When we arrived for the second time, Marc would remember our name, asked about the trip we had in France and apologized for the lack of a smoking room. Late at night, we asked for a blanket and Marc just got it for us in zero time. When we first checked-in, we didnt know how to use the air-condition, both Isabel and the housekeeping lady were eager to assist. MOreover, during the last night, when I was trying to e- check-in for our flight, I had trouble with printing our tickets in the public PC of the hotel. Although, it was obviously the time to change shifts, both Marc and Isabel stayed with me, offered me the front -desk computer(!!!) and started a discussion while I was trying to fix the tickets problem. The most amazing of all? They even offered to compensate me because the public PC was not printing out!!!! We had a great time in Barcelona and part of it was because of these two young perople and their kindness.

Sleep Quality - I had to ask to be moved to another room after one night here. I was placed in the first room on the bottom floor, close to the kitchen and consierge. From about 5AM onward all I could hear was the banging of pots and pans and the consierge's heels clicking back and forth past my door.

It was average in almost all respects. The rooms were clean, well equipped, functional, but nondescript - you could find the same room in any European 3-star from Dublin to Sofia. Slightly annoying: when we arrived early afternoon, the rooms were not yet ready (although this had been specified before). Each room had a safe in the wardrobe, but they were not fixed with bolts and could have been easily removed as a whole. The hotel is located on a narrow but noisy street. One of the rooms had its windows to the street, and with an open window we were woken up at around 5 by the traffic. The other room was very calm - sleeping with the window open was not a problem. Staff were reasonably professional and the receptionists spoke good English and French, but when one of us had lost some documents on the way from the airport, they didn't know any lost+found telephone numbers. We had found some numbers in our own travel guide book, and the receptionists were kind enough to call them up for us. Breakfast: no need to take it at the hotel - there are a few nice places for continental breakfast in the vicinity of the hotel, especially around Pla\u00e7a de Joaquim Folguera. Getting there: the hotel is a bit off the main attractions of the city. The nearest subway station (\"El Putxet\", line 7) is within easy walking distance (2 or 3 minutes). But the big problem is that you always have to change trains at Pla\u00e7a Catalunya (and often at yet another station) and walk through miles of tunnels there. As mentioned by other reviewers before, subway line 7 is not operated by the same company as the other \"metro\" lines. Single tickets for the metro are not valid on this line, you need an extra ticket. However, the multi-ride \"T10\" tickets are valid on all city train lines (including line 7 and the line from and to the airport), *and* they cost much less than 10 single tickets. Changing trains is included in a single ride. You can also use a T10 ticket for multiple persons on a single ride (just need to validate it several times at the gates). Overall recommendation: I would recommend this hotel for a short-term business traveler - decent value for money.

Negatives: Absolute nightmare to park if you have a car. Tiny protected lot underground that had the tighest turn I've ever seen to get down and we've driven all throughout Europe many times over the years. Took us awhile to get in and out so I'd suggest either not taking a car or parking it than using transportation (which is what I suggest for all big European cities anyway). The parking was pretty expensive as well. In addition, no free breakfast at all and the Internet was really expensive.

I had heard that people had booked hotels online and didn't get what they paid for in Spain. However I was very pleased with this hotel. Firstly it is easily reachable from Ex Puxet Metro just two rights and you are there. Only a five minute walk literally. Ok so its on the north side of Barcelona, and up a quiet side street, but only a short walk to a fabulous quiet park with immense city views (highly recommended) The reception is open and inviting with staff that can speak French and English as well as their Mother tongue on call 24 hours a day! Fantastically polite, and very willing to please, I was made to feel right at home. The room was cosy with a clean bathroom, fresh towels and a fantasitic array of bath freebies.. a picasso box in an array of colours.. truly fab! The bed was comfortable, TV and a mini fridge containing an assortment of refreshments and snacks. I found these to be a bit on the expensive side, but across the road from the hotel is a local Spar grocer store that sells pretty much everything and very cheap. There is a cafe/bar for coffee and more along with a restaurant. Admittedly I did not eat here as I was too busy exploring the city to spend time at the hotel! Overall the hotel was comfortable and friendly. Not to mention helpful with advice when I needed it.

Booked at last minute based on reviews & price. Location & Directions: Although this is out of city centre, the advantage is it's quieter, better value & the train station is 2mins away. The maps on the site & Google aren't that accurate, so follow these directions: From airport get the blue aerobus to the terminus at Placa Catalunya (it only costs 7 Euros return & takes about half an hour). At Pl Catalunya, cross to the opposite side of the square (like a big roundabout) & on the corner of the next street look for the sign for FGC station. If you're here for a few days, select the T10 ticket option - this allows 10 journeys on any Metro/FCG Train/Bus in Zone 1 (otherwise just get a single for 1.30 Euros). Take the brown Line 7 to El Putxet Station (5 stops to Pl Catalunya) - takes less than 10mins. When leaving El Putxet, as you come up the steps, bear right & use the exit signposted 'C. Joaquim Folgeura'. At street level, turn right & look for 'Mercat de Sant Gervasi' (an indoor meat/fruit & veg market). Walk down the side of this & across a pedestrianised square to the road that runs parallel to the one you left. The road you are then on is Carrera de St Gervasi de Cassoles (which is the actual address for the hotel). Head left down this road & about 200 yards on the left is the hotel (opposite the SPAR supermarket). There's several cafe's, tapas bars & restaurants nearby (the hotel breakfast was ok for the money, but the evening meal we had was overpriced & they even charged us for the bread rolls!). As it's a residential area, take your phrasebook with you as, unlike in the city, the local restaurants don't have the menus in English. Alternatively, get the train back into the City for lots of choice. Staff on reception speak good English & were very helpful. Room: We had room 5 to the left of reception on the ground floor. Was a little concerned about noise, but it wasn't that bad, apart from the noisy guests above us who thankfully left after 2 nights. This room had the advantage of a small balcony, but only actually got sun for about half an hour. Room 6 next door was better positioned, but as the rooms face into an internal 'courtyard', the surrounding walls tend to block much of the sun. The room was a good size with a decent sized bed, wardrobes & safe deposit box . Decor is contemporary & functional, although TV picture quality was poor. There's a small mini bar with enough room to store some water/soft drinks from the SPAR across the road. No tea/coffee facilities in room (seems to be a common theme in Barcelona!). Bathroom was good size with shower/bath & hairdryer. Good range of complimentary toiletries i.e. tissues/ toothbrush & paste/disposable razor & cream/small bottles of shampoo & bath gel/bath sponge/comb, but only a 2inch square piece of soap! Aircon works, but heating didn't (we had mixed weather, so had to turn off air con to keep room warmer). Out & about: To get back to city take FCG train to Placa Catalunya - you're then at the top end of Las Rambla & can use Metro to most places from there. Alternatively, if you want to visit Park Guell, just turn left out of hotel & when you reach main road, cross over to other side & walk up to the right about 200 yards to get the no: 74 bus - tell the driver where you want to go & they'll happily tell you when you're at the right stop (think it's near Larrard). At the drop off, cross over the dual carriage way & walk down to the left then take the 2nd right up the hill - it's signposted up to Park Guell. To get to the city from there look for the park exit nearest to Valcarca Metro station (near Glories?) - it's about 400 yards downhill to the station & turn right at the main road (again it's signposted all the way).", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aylmer, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDisappointment\u201d", "Author": "Canadians-in-UK", "ReviewID": "UR13086939", "Content": "Beautiful and clean hotel with friendly staff but for the price, we were quite disappointed.

Furthermore, if this had happen right in downtown Barcelona, I could have understood it, but since that hotel is a bit out of the way, the inconveniences were not worth it at all.
