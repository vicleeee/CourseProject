This includes car horns and sirens of emergency services, which will probably wake you up a few times (though we slept ok after a busy day of sightseeing). However, the Hermannplatz U-bahn stop is right around the corner, which is very convenient, and we were generally not bothered by noise from other guests. The area doesn\u2019t have many restaurants or bars, but be sure to ask for a map with recommendations at reception because there are some within walking distance. Our room had a double bed, two chairs, a small desk, a very small television and a luggage area next to the door (big enough to store and unpack a small suitcase). It had air-conditioning and free Wi-Fi, though to access this you need to get a 24-hour access code at the reception desk (and you don\u2019t get access codes for every day of your stay at check-in). The hotel also advertised free coffee and tea facilities in the rooms, which as it turned out had to be requested first. We did this soon after arrival, but were told they could not be delivered until the next morning--not very convenient if you stay for one day! Our bathroom had a very small shower area with one of those shower curtains that insists on clinging to you. Unfortunately this meant that even with a short shower the bathroom would be soaking wet, and we had to sacrifice two of our towels each day to make sure we could go to the toilet without getting wet feet. The wash basin in our bathroom was leaky, but this actually didn\u2019t matter at all because we had to put towels there anyway because of the shower. This wetness was reflected in some moldiness between the tiles. On the other hand the cleaning staff (which did a fine job) did clean our room early each day, which confined the water problem to the mornings. Breakfast was adequate but nothing special. The room was quite busy and so was the staff, which did not appear to have time to actually notice any guests. Service at the reception desk, in contrast, was friendly albeit a bit cool. The reception area also features a small lounge, public toilets and a luggage storage space. Perhaps one of the most interesting services of the hotel is free access to a fitness center at the Karstadt across the road (though we did not use this). One thing to be aware of is that the hotel allows smoking in many of the rooms and in the common areas. Although you can request a non-smoking room when booking this is not guaranteed. Also, the hallways and elevators tend to smell like very well-used ashtrays. To summarize: Noisy location but easy access to the U-bahn. Good service, clean, but our bathroom was inconvenient and wet.

Well, the Hermannplatz it is not really the Kurfurstendam or Unter den Linden, but as all Berlin sights are scattered all over the city, the hotel is located rather centrally. Around KaDeWe or the Friedrichstrasse would be more central but probably also much more expensive. The Hermannplatz is quite busy with several streets intersecting, 2 subway lines, various bus stops, the large department store Karstadt, a McDonalds, several bars and small restaurants. From here, one can reach virtually each interesting place one needs to see in Berlin within one metro transfer. We found the extensive bus network also very useful. A tip: bus M29 (stops 10 meters from the hotel entrance) runs very frequently until 2:00 or so in the night to the giant KaDeWe department store, in 30 minutes; in the upper level of this double-decker bus you have a nice view.

Well worth a visit are the palaces and gardens at Chalottenberg and Potsdam, the superb museums on the Museum Island and the new Reichstag building (expect to queue for about an hour).", "Date": "September 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cClean and convenient hotel\u201d", "Author": "AlexFamily", "ReviewID": "UR8721053", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel on a package tour and were very pleased with the rooms and breakfast.

Large clean bathroom with ample towels and hair dryer. Built-in soap dispensers were a plus as we were travelling light. TV worked well with two English stations - CNN and BBC News.

Hotel was clean, price was reasonable, location near Turkish area of Berlin interesting, with excellent shwarma near by, some of the best I ever tasted, at great prices. Although it is close to the subway (across the street), it is quite a distance by subway from the centre of the western part of the city (the Ku'Damm) although not too far from the Alexanderplatz in the eastern part. The hotel is not located in a touristy area. Staff was efficient, if not overly friendly. My one complaint is that I could not figure out the air conditioning in the room, and the room was hot, stuffy and smelly for lack of ventilation. Iam not sure that the hotel had air conditioning or internal ventilation at all. Then again, I could have asked for assistance, but did not. My room was a single and quite small. Decent breakfast served as part of the price, although when in Europe I prefer a quick espresso on the street rather than a sit down breakfast. A good place to stay on a budget. Not much in terms of facilities such as a gym, pool, etc, but the hotel does advertise that it is affiliated with a health club near by. Good neighborhood bar a few doors down, lots of locals hang out. Friendly clientele.

The Hotel is based in a predominantly Turkish area,and has very easy access to Hermanplatz U bahn.There are ecent eating places nearby(especially if you like Pizza,you can get decent ones for 3 euros!!!) there is even a subway and Mac Donalds if you are abit sad!!! The Hotel room was big BUT it faces a busy road which can have noise implications.If you have kids you may want a back room.When we were there it was HOT! There is no AC but we got fan and there's a mini bar with a good fridge.A shop nearby allows you to buy your own drinks and use the fridge!!! Breakfast was buffet style and was more than adequate and comprised of the usual Euro delights of breads,cheeses,meats,fruit,cereals,coffee and a nice touch of Earl Grey tea!!! Overall this may be a problem if you have kids and are facing the busy road,although the double glazing drowns out the noise,if its hot at night you wouldn't want the windows open and a fan might keep you awake.The location is ideal for travelling around and it is relativelt inexpensive.

It was comfortable, pleasant, convenient, and seemed to be meticululously well-run. I was travelling alone, and was given a single room of a reasonable size for one - not just a converted cupboard. The bed was comfortable and the shower/toilet was clean & attractive. I chose the hotel mainly because of its location : in Hermannplatz right at the terminus of the airport bus (No. 171) from Schonefeld Airport. That's very convenient - esp. when you arrive at around midnight, and are a bit wary of being ripped-off by taxis taking you across a huge & strange city. The city U-Bahn is literally just around the corner, and it took me straight to Alexanderplatz in c. 12 minutes. The bus stop (for other buses places in town e.g. Charlottenburg) is at the hotel front door. People in Berlin asked me: \"Why are you staying all the way down there? That's not where tourists go.\" But I always said the location suited me fine. I never needed a taxi once: I always knew where I was going. The quality of the hotel was a pleasant surprise: the cold breakfast buffet was large, varied and very saitsfying - although the only hot dish was scrambled eggs ( but that's minor). It was lovely to eat breakfast on the top storey while looking out over the panorama of Berlin. I took my own electric kettle, coffee & milk powder with me, as the hotel didn't supply these for evening coffee in the bedroom. But they had complimentary coffee on offer in the foyer: you helped yourself as you wanted. I was even allowed free coffee after I had checked out and was waiting for the airport bus. Little things can mean a lot. I asked for 2 pillows instead of one, and got them. I was asked to pay a 50 Euro deposit for the mini-bar when I arrived. I said I wouldn't, because I had no intention of using it (I suspected having been ripped-off in other hotels) and I asked for it to be emptied straightaway. At midnight, the young receptionist didn't think he was allowed to do that: but the following evening when I returned, the minibar was empty and stayed empty all week.

My friends and I had one triple room (with one double & one single bed) and one single room between us. Both rooms were very clean (cleaned and towels changed every day) and the beds were very comfortable. We were on the sixth floor which helped reduce traffic noise, as the hotel's at a corner next to a crossroads with traffic lights. There's a phone, a minibar, TV and internet access. The restaurant on the top floor served an excellent breakfast every morning - it's a self service buffet with a large selection of breads, meat, cheese, eggs, yoghurts and drinks. The best thing about the hotel was the location. If you're coming from Schoenefeld you can get the 171 Airport bus to Hermannplatz (the last stop) for 2 Euros. It takes about an hour but it's also a regular bus service. There are a lot of people getting on and off - not the best if you have large suitcases. You could take the U-Bahn from Rudow station instead - It's about five mins from the airport in a taxi but there is also a station outside the airport. The hotel is right next to the Hermannplatz U-Bahn station. Buy a day ticket for 6 Euros (or a group ticket for up to five people for EUR15) and take advantage of Berlin's integrated subway system, you'll only have to wait 10 minutes at the most for a train. We had no problems getting around. The streets around the hotel are fine, we didn't feel unsafe at any time. There's a great Croatian restaurant about 2 minutes walk down the street and there's also a Lebanese one nearby. You're also close to a bakery, shops, bars and a McDonalds (if you really have to!).
