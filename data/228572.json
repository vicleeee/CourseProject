The only reason for writing this review is that I believe this hotel is an insult towards customers and travellers. Our stay's duration was 7 days and as the days were passing the things did not get any better, on the contrary became even worse. To begin with, our room did not have any internet access and thus I had all the time to move to the reception in order to check my business emails. In addition, the sheets were not extremely white-clean and room service did not visited the room for a couple of days without any reason. Furthermore, the sound isolation was really bad. Moreover the toilet rubbish bin was broken from the beginning and althouth reported several times never got replaced. The response time of the reception was extremely slow and the staff generally speaking was quite rude. Last but not least, the worst thing that happened was this one time that the room service did not visited the room and the toilet paper run out, after my request and delay of 30 minutes and a second call to the reception, one of the staff opened the door and entered without even knocking! Because I would not like to refer to only negative issues, althouth these seem to remain in memory, the hotel had rich breakfast, really spacious bathroom, reasonable pricing, it is near the centre of the city, but apart from these nothing special. Based on my personal experience, I would NOT recommended it under no circumstances!", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWorst Hotel Experience ever\u201d", "Author": "Hardiman_11", "ReviewID": "UR118516129", "Content": "We wanted to stay on the Ramblas to be near the centre of the city knowing that it had Gaudis work there and to basically have lots of Sangria and see the Sagrada { unfinished cathedral.} My agent didnt tell me that we were going to this\" out of town\" horrible hotel . I found out when the taxi drove us there after our 4mths of travel. We were short of money but not worried because breakfast was included and we had paid for a city tour before we left home. Now we are very fit walkers but we are oldies and the hilly walk to the Ramblas and Guell Park in 38 degrees nearly killed us. Our city tour didnt turn up and we waited for 2 mornings. The receptionist didnt want to help . It was though she didnt like Australians. When it was time to leave they wouldnt give us a late checkout and we werent going to fly out till 6pm a long trip Barcelona-London- sydney. As it was so hot i went into the toilets to wash myself before the trip home and the receptionist followed me in. I dont normally be critical of staff because they are a plentiful commodity and they move on but this experience ruined our only visit to Barcelona. We had a view of rooftops and the bathroom was narrow.

The reception were nice and talked very good English, the rooms were very big and clean, breakfast wasn't Catalan or Spanish, but international, fresh and yummy, and the metro station was a five minute walk. The hotel is really good and it's near a super market which we bough bread and cheese from it and made sandwiches for dinner. We took the Barcelona Bus Turistic ( http://www.barcelonabusturistic.cat ) and it was a very good decision, we walked about 20 min.s to the nearest tourist bus station and went to see the best of Barcelona including Sagrada Familia, Montjuic area, Tibidabo, and the Barcelonetta area while we took the metro to Placa Espanya at night (magic fountain show) and Placa Catalunya and we walked about an hour to Parc Guell.

It was an average 4* hotel with spacious rooms, clean enough. Comfortable beds and pillows. Stayed in a room on 7th floor (max 8) noise level from the street is kept low through the double glazing. The room has air conditioning mini fridge and TV. The bathroom also spacious but smelly due to lack of good ventilation. Breakfast average continental but plenty. 5minutes walk to underground metro stop, 10 minutes away from plaza Catalunya (start of LaRamplas). Tips. Buy the T10 ticket to use in Metro and Bus ( u can use it numerous times within 1 hour, costs 8.25E) The tourist bus is also an economic solution costs 20E for 1 day or 25E for two days. It will take you everywhere. If you're planning to visit all the museums buy the museum card costs 25E and allows you to enter several museums including Picasso and La Pedrera in different case expect to pay around 10E and 14E for each, as u can see just the entrance to these two costs around 25E, so buying this museum pass is a good value for money. Entance to Miro museum costs 8E while Dali museum in Figueres 9E p/p Expect to wait in ques at least 15min in all main atractions (Casa Batlo-La Pedrera-Picasso) while at SagradaFamilia it will take ages waiting in line. Better stay out and take photos the exterior. Make sure you see the water fountains show at Plaza Espanya (the show I believe starts 9.30 to 10.30 Thursday and Friday) Take care of your belongings at all time. Communication with the locals is difficult (use hand language and gestures). When ordering food also check the drinks prices.

We were there as a football team participating in Barcelona Cup and I am one of the coaches. We stayed there 7 days. On the 4th day a wardrobe door fell from the wardrobe (a sliding piece of glass with a frame is the door) and hit one of the kids on the head. Thank god the boy was not hurt badly. The door ,as it was only glass, was teared into pieces. The bellboy came to the room after we were notified and we noticed that the wheel on the bottom of the door was faulty so as the door slided it went off the rail and fell down. The bellboy then apologised and gave instructions to the reception to change the room, something that didn't happen as the hotel was fully booked. The boys parents wanted to sue the hotel after this incident, but since they apologised we convinced them not to proceed. On our check out day (after three days) we asked for a room for our luggage and were given one ,as we had to check out at 11 o clock but the bus would come on 4 o clock in the afternoon. At 3 o clock the \" joke of a manager\" of the hotel came with an invoice of \u20ac215 as the cost for the broken door and demanded to pay!!! For three days we were told nothing, and one hour before leaving the hotel with our luggages locked in a room we had to pay to go!!! After we refused to pay, as we explained the situation and that the hotel should apologise and that somebody could have been hurt badly from this incident, the \"joke of a manager\" of the hotel insisted that the door was broken from the boys. Actually the boys that was hurt parents got furious and the \"joke of a manager\" called the police who arrived without uniforms (4 of them) but with guns on their waist. In some stage the \"joke of a manager\" asked us to pay half the price to end the argumet (how cheap can this be as he insisted that the cost was \u20ac215). When the police arrived they were just looking and not intervening, and then we asked them if they were the police and if they were on duty. They replied yes to both questions. Then we asked them why they were there and replied that they came for coffee!!! Therefore we told them that the \"joke of a manager\" would not give us our luggage to go and we were held hostages and asked them to take action. One of them showed his gun and told us \"pay\". The bus was already waiting for 20 minutes and we could lose our flight. 64 people left on the decision of the so-called manager and the so-called police if they were to leave us go to the airport. The most ridiculous part of the story is that we had 34 rooms booked for 7 nights and the least a chain of hotels like Catalonia Hotels is to be able to cover a minor damage even if it was made from the guests which in our case was a faulty door with a danger of a really bad accident. What happened then is that we paid the \u20ac215 because we would lose the flight. We reported the incident in the police at the airport and will proceed with legal actions from our country against this \"joke of a manager\" and the \"joke of policemen\" whom we have their faces in camera and also Catalonia Hotels. Also we will report the \" joke of a manager\" to the higher hierarchy of the Catalonia Hotels Chain as he is a disgrace to their brand. Now apart from the above incident. -Location far away from centre -Bar without bartender most of the time and some times they wouldn't have change and therefore would not give any drinks unless you didn't want change. -Restaurant service a total disaster. Could wait for more than 20 minutes to replenish dishes in buffet and also plates. The same with breakfast as to replenish cheese or ham could take ages. Food though was tasty. -Reception friendly and helpfull and could speak english. -Manager a total joke!!!!", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent for students\u201d", "Author": "Nikole2011", "ReviewID": "UR114561043", "Content": "This is our last night here as apart of eftours and ii must say it's great.

There was a drainage problem with the shower but it was taken care of right away. The staff was courteous and helpful. Most guests we encountered were American or British.
