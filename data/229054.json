The nearest metro station was about five minutes walk from the hotel, and it was pretty easy to get to the hotel from the airport. We just booked in advance a shuttle from airport. However, if you arrive late at night I highly recommend to take a taxi. We took a taxi when travelld from the city back to the airport and the price (40 euros if I remember correctly) was about the same but it was much quicker than a shuttle service. Took about 40 minutes at nine o'clock in the morning. The other thing we liked in this hotel was that it served a good breakfast. We just ate in the morning and next time late in the afternoon. Make sure that you ask for a cup of cappuccino or espresso from the staff. It's much better than the coffee from the machine. There were also fresh fruits available. Then about the room. We got a room from the first floor even though we asked one from the upper level. However, the room was quiet and nice. It was quite big too! The view was on Montecitirio square. We would have appreciated for a free wifi but they served it only for one hour per your stay. Afterwards the price was 10 euros for 24 hours. Do not be afraid of policemen because the hotel is located next to Italian parliament so there are always policemen around.

The staff were always friendly and helpful and the nibbles they gave us with our bar drinks were always an added bonus. We didnt have dinner in the hotel, but took a guide book by rick steves with us and ate in his recommended restaurants. If you do this, avoid the Osteria di Fontana near the Pantheon. Very over priced for very bland food, Miscellenea round the back of the Panteon was great for cheap food and a great atmosphere,seems to be a hit with the locals too which is always a good sign.

Little things, like decent coffee at breakfast, or a new bar of soap from the cleaning crew (really, I had to snag a new one off a cleaning cart after our little soap bar was used up and not replaced after two days). The rooms themselves seem slightly shabby. The tub leaked, leaving a huge puddle on the tile floor, but I thought that this probably explained the water stains on the ceiling of our room ...

The only real down side was the AC had been shut off for the season and the room was on the warm side forcing us to open the 8' tall windows which let in the noise of the morning cleaning, trash pickup, occazional protester, etc. One of the staff, Patrick, spoke English and genuinely tried to act as our tour guide. The other staff were stuffy and rather brusque.

We could walk to everything (Vatican and Trastevere are a little far but the ancient Rome sites, Piazza Navona, Campo Fiori, and the Trevi fountain are just short strolls away.

Super atmosphere, great waiting staff and able to have a bit of fun. Returned there having sampled a less than memorable eaterie the name best forgotten. Romans very pleasant people.

We had been to Rome before so just wanted to stroll around and have an evening among the beautiful sites. We usually prefer small B&Bs with more personal service. We arrived at the hotel with our suitcases and backpacks after a five hour train ride. The man at the front desk was somewhat friendly, but in a contrived way. We asked about getting a taxi to the airport the next morning, and all he did was try to push their limo service on us, which is more than a taxi. We\u2019ve been to Rome and have taken a cab to the airport before, so we know that it is a 40 EUR fixed rate. He was trying to make us think that it may or may not be higher than that, implying that the taxi drivers could rip us off, which isn\u2019t possible. There were other people checking in beside us that were in a higher age bracket than us and were most likely more well off than us. They were getting much nicer treatment, getting everything explained to them. Our guy didn\u2019t even tell us anything about breakfast, I overheard it from the other group. When they were done they were offered the services of the bell hop. We were not and handled our bags ourselves. When we checked out the next morning we asked the (different) guy to call the taxi for us and he also tried to get us to take the limo. No thanks. He was very cold and impersonal and hardly talked to us. I felt like since we are probably not in the regular demographic of people who stay in this hotel, the staff were condescending towards us and did not treat us equally to other guests. The room itself was fine. We had a great view onto the piazza. We didn\u2019t spend much time in there but it worked fine for us. The decor could use a serious update. Very dated and tacky. Hideous carpet. Wifi is a rip off at 10 EUR a day. Breakfast is mostly included and had quite a bit of selection. Eggs and omelettes cost, and were outrageously priced at 8 to12 EUR. The location is absolutely fantastic, with the Pantheon a few minutes walk and the Coloseeum about 15 minutes, but I would never want anyone to stay somewhere where the staff are so blatantly rude and stereotyping towards people who they don\u2019t think fit in at their establishment. The behaviour of the front desk staff is totally inappropriate, as we are all paying money to stay there and should all be treated the same and with genuine kindness.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middlebury, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "Karo8083", "ReviewID": "UR118577408", "Content": "The rooms are large and clean.

This hotel had been recommended to me by a friend and I was able to find a \"reasonable late booking rate\" on the Hotel website. Rome is very expensive , particularly to find a good hotel in the historic district. The day before leaving for Rome, I read in newspapers that a \"general strike\" was to happen on Tuesday, 6 September..... not a good thing for a visitor... and the day after my arrival... Upon arrival at the hotel, the Front office staff was helpful in trying to confirm as to what would be open, what would be closed i.e. on the following day ( General strike) ( although no one seemed to be certain as to what would happen during the general strike ) I arose early on 6 Sept, - Day of strike and the bus's, metro were running !..... I took bus to Colisseum for the Special under ground tour.. (previous --- prepaid reservations required ) but Colisseum was closed.... due to strike !!! ( I had been assured that Colliseum would be OPEN... and that public Transportation would be closed ) Instead.... public Trans was working ( at that time) and the museums were Closed !!! After discovering that Colosseo was closed,,,, I tried to take bus or Metro back to central Historico area...... but now both the bus's and Metro were CLOSED !! In the meantime,,, thousands of people were assembling in the Colosseo area for the Strike !! Police were assembling so this did not look like a good place to hang around !!! So.,. walked back to Centro Historico area.... a pleasant walk,,, approx 20 minutes to get where I needed to go to .. ------- Note: Bus's, Metro re-opened several hours later.... so Public Transportation was closed only for a few hours.. ( due to General Strike but most all museums were closed for the entire day) Church's remained open.. (i.e.Church's were not closed due to General Strike !! ) At the hotel, Front Desk staff helped me to call Reservations office and re-schedule my Colesseo reservations for following day... very helpful... Front desk also called to book my tour for Pallazo Valentini..... a new attraction in Roma that requires reservations.. ( must reserve a tour, either in English or Italian) ....This place is a newly opened attraction in Roma... and IMO,,, is a MUST SEE for anyone visiting Roma.. mulit-media attraction.... When booking my room on hotel's website, I had requested a room overlooking Piazza but upon arrival at hotel... such a room was not available. The room that I arrived into was a large spacious double room... very nice but no view.. i.e. a small window looking out the back... Whenst traveling, I do not spend much time in hotel room but do like some type of view ( if available) when in room. I requested a room change at Front Desk,,, and when doing so, was warned that \"there might be some noise \"... i.e due to the general strike\". I packed my bags, and left hotel early in the morning ... requesting that my room be changed.. Returning to hotel, late afternoon, Front Desk had moved my bags to a new room, smaller,, but with a wonderful view,.... overlooking piazza.... and the strike !! Strike was indeed noisy... so I pulled out my faithful ( don't leave home without them) earplugs..... and slept like a baby.. ( I do not believe that front rooms would be noisy otherwise ) This room ( albeit small) was comfortable and had a great view... overlooking piazza, obelisk, Marcus Aurelius column in the background and the Italian Parliment building... The breakfast was superb... the staff most helpful,,,,, a great location... Public transportation hubs are a few minutes walk away on the Corso..... My only complaint......Nazionale Roma Hotel charges 10 E, daily, to use internet .. There is a computer for guests in lobby area and wireless service is available in your room.. .... but at a cost of 10 euros , per day.... To me,,, this is not necessary.... Most ALL of the low, mid priced and higher priced hotels , throughout Europa, are offering FREE wireless service and a FREE computer point within the hotel , for the convenience of their guests.... for FREE... i.e NO charge... It costs a hotel , virtually nothing... to offer their guest free internet, free wireless.... but to charge 10 E .... seems excessive , in my opinion... and is not \"guest friendly\"..

We arrived earlier than check-in, but were able to go to our room right away. Every member of the staff was always courteous and helpful. We asked for suggestions for restaurants in the area, and were provided two very good restaurants to try; both within walking distance and both really good. Can't say enough good things about the staff, but shortly after we arrived, we noticed a small water leak in a corner of the room. I contacted the front desk to let them know so they could check room above ours and fix water leak before more damage could occur. Rather than disturb us to fix leak in upstairs room, they moved us to a suite. I found that a nice touch -- we were not expecting that at all!! Breakfast buffet, which was included, was unexpectedly nice. Good variety. Everything was fresh and nicely presented. I had never seen kiwis that BIG! Both rooms we had during our stay were clean and well kept. I particularly liked the view from the windows in the first room we had -- St. Peter's dome in the distance was what you would expect in a postcard. Just gorgeous. The second room had a view of the Pantheon...also gorgeous. My daughter and I walked everywhere. The Nazionale is really at the center of it all. There are signs posted everywhere indicating direction of where the different sights are so it's difficult to get lost. We had our choice of gelato every night on the way back to the hotel. Can't wait to start planning next trip to Rome. I'll definitely stay here again. One thing I wasn't too happy about, and I really don't think it's the hotel, is the fact that only a \"select\" number of cars can come to the hotel's doors. I hired independent transfers to and from hotel, and both drivers had to drop us off and pick us up on Via del Corso -- about two blocks away. We had to walk with two suitcases through Piazza Colonna and the Palazzo di Montecitorio.

The hotel is in a very charming old area, and is a very short walk (5 minutes) to the Pantheon and wonderful piazzas and restaurants. One of the best gelatto places is also just around the corner. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the Forum in one direction and 15 minute walk to the Spanish Steps in the other. All our rooms faced the Piazza and it was amazingly quiet at night (we were there when Parliament was not in session, so I am not sure how quiet it would be other times). EACH ROOM IS UNIQUE: We stayed at the hotel 2 times. The first time we had 2 Deluxe rooms on the 4th floor (the highest floor), the second we had 2 Deluxe rooms on the 3 floor. Each room was completely different in layout and decor, but they all had updated nice bathrooms, 'antique' (or older) furnishings, high ceilings, newer very well insulated windows and shutters that opened, a very large flat screen TV, and a minibar. The ceilings on the 4th floor are quite high, but lower than those on all other floors. The only minor negative was the wallpaper in the rooms was starting to curl at the edges. That combined with the eclectic antique decor could be either charming or a hint of shabby chic - depending upon your taste. I am not sure if all the hotel rooms face the Piazza, but I would recommend those rooms as it is a pleasant view, and the rooms are quiet and sunny. The other rooms would face very narrow streets, which could be noisier. GREAT BREAKFAST: We were pleasantly surprised at how wonderful the complementary 'continental breakfast' was. It included a selection of cereals, meats, great selection of fresh fruit, great coffee, juices, and great pastries. It is also served in a pleasant dining room. It seemed every complementary breakfast was standard, but I would check when making reservations. RESERVATIONS: We first heard of this hotel from Rick Steve's Italy travel guide. We booked the rooms directly through the hotel's website and got the 30 day pay in advance, non-cancellable rate which was a better rate than what we could find on the various other travel websites. We thought the hotel, while not inexpensive, was a great value. BOTTOM LINE: We would recommend this hotel but if you are looking for quiet, I would recommend that you check w the desk to see how noisy the Piazza is when Parliament is in session.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!

I'd booked it on the strong advice of a friend because of its 'authenticity, comfort, and divine location\" but honestly we were blown away by how comfortable and special it was (and I have stayed in four and five star properties all over the world.) Nazionale is literally at ground-zero from everywhere you want to walk in Rome: two minutes to the Pantheon (we looked at this awesome 2000 year old building at least five times a day,) five to Piazza Navona, a few more minutes to Campo di Fiore and the Tiber; and in the other direction it was five minutes to the Trevi Fountain, another ten to the Spanish Steps and the Borghese Musei... I think the longest walk from the hotel might have been 30 minutes to the Vatican or Coloseum. Nazionale is on a quiet pedestrian square next to the Italian Parliament building, so it is very well-tended to and safe. The best gelato in Rome (Giolitti) is around the corner, and there are dozens of heavenly little trattorias, vias, and amazing churches all in the 'hood.' Now about the room. I was travelling with my grown daughter so we needed a 'twin' bedded room (hard to secure in Europe) and had reserved a 'twin classic\". To my pleasant surprise we were upgraded to a 'twin executive' which according to the hotel's floorplan was one of two largest rooms in hotel. Gorgeous view over the piazza, comfortable beds and linens, spacious bathroom with huge jacuzzi tub, quiet, cool AC (a must in Rome.) The room was a fantastic refuge for late afternoon siesta every day after hours of sightseeing in the heat. The staff at the hotel was also most accommodating, arranging excursions, hotel reservations, airline check-ins, etc. Though the rooms are updated with modern comforts the whole feeling of the hotel is old-world Italian, very appealing and what we look for in travel (which is to say you knew you were not staying at a Mandarin Oriental or Four Seasons.) Only down notes: The coffee at the inclusivo breakfast (ample with plenty of choices) could have been better; the internet was 15 euro/day (I think it should be free at any four or more star establishment); and we couldn't check into our room until late in day of arrival, about three hours after promise (and we were very tired having taken a night flight from the east coast US.)

My dad and sister stayed in one room the first night, and because of my dad's snoring, we had to move them to a room with a wall/door. They were more than accommodating, giving us a larger room at no extra charge, and moved our luggage there as well. Nothing to worry about on our end!

And of course, for people like us who are from the Tropics, air-conditioning was of utmost importance to us. Having cancelled a nearby Hotel in order to stay at this Hotel Nazionale last minute, we thought the Hotel oozes much more Italian charm. Whenever we are in Italy, I will try to stay in classically designed Hotels. And from the reviews here, rooms were reportedly more spacious, and I am glad to say that rooms are indeed bigger here; common areas are also classically beautiful! Took a cab from the Termini and arrived at Via del Corso's Palazzo Chigi (the PM's office) and the Hotel Nazionale was easy to find - just cross the road and walk straight on! Having requested a higher floor room facing the Hotel's back, we were shown to a 4th floor Executive room, facing other houses' roof tops and courtyards. A glimpse of St Peter's was in the distance. Not facing any roads or the Piazza Monte Citorio, the room was indeed very quiet for a good night's sleep. Our room was indeed very spacious, it is certainly the size of a suite by any Itatian city's standards - right beside the comfy bed was a closet room, a dressing table within a wall niche (nice for putting on make-up!) and a spacious bathroom with jacuzzi tub and shower. Separated by a door to the bedroom was a nice walk-in area and sitting room with 3 seater sofa bed, dinning table, coffee table, armchair and an office table. Though everything in the room was not brand new, everything worked and there was sufficient lighting for reading. Toiletries including body lotion and a safe were available. There were 2 TVs with English channels, good for catching up with news happening around the Globe. Breakfast choice was the widest among the 6 hotels in this trip, enabling us to enjoy something different during our 2 nights stay - perfectto! Location wise, this Hotel is also very centrally located - 5 minutes to the Trevi and Piazza Navona, 10 minutes to the Spanish Steps for branded shopping and Il Vittoriale for the Capitoline Museums etc. But the closest supermarket we could find was at Forno's, a shop right beside the Trevi, 5 minutes away. Maybe there were other closer shops around the Hotel to buy drinks and fruits, but we did not come across any during our stay? All Reception staff that we had come into contact with was knowledgeable, kind and helpful. Special mention must be made of Sig. Yanni, who had gone out of his way to help converse with the owner of a handicraft shop in Spoleto, to help to send our purchased items to the Hotel. Grazie mille, Yanni, we cannot thank you enough! So, after all the praises, why still the 4 star ratings \u2026 Frankly, if not for the air-conditioning issue, we could have given this Hotel a 6 stars ratings if we were allowed to do so. Yes, from beginning to the end, we were so pleased with this Hotel that my husband had said that after numerous trips to the Eternal City, this was the Hotel in Rome that we should be returning to and I fully concur with him. Our stay was at the beginning of the autumn season. In the day, I could still see ladies walking around in T-shirts, sleeveless blouses, baring their cleavages and sweating. Night time temperature was still around 20 or 21 (note: Rome is not like the Umbrian cities which were already experiencing 10-15 degrees during the nights due to their hill-top elevated position). Much to our surprise, on the night of 3rd October, from 6pm onwards, air-conditioning was switched off for all rooms. A check with the Receptionists had confirmed my most feared - that the Hotel didn't think air-conditioning was necessary, and so switches it off. We then requested and received a huge fan, which blows no air - this still puzzles me at this point? Needless to say, we open all windows but I still didn't sleep well that night. The next night, I asked again, and this time, received a much smaller fan that actually worked! And with this smaller fan, I had slept much better, in preparation for a 13 hour flight home the next day. During our stay, I had also seen porters sending fans to the other rooms, so we weren't the only ones who complain about the lack of air-conditioning. In our honest opinion, the Hotel should have waited till mid October, or for the temperatures to fall below 15 degree C, before turning off the air-conditioning. Needless to say, this air-conditioning thingy will keep us from coming back to this Hotel at least during the 'border' months of October, March and April. So if air-conditioning is important to you, my advice would be to double check before you book. Notwithstanding the air-conditioning issue, I thought we had enjoyed our stay very much at this well located and well managed Hotel. We thought it should have enjoyed a much higher rating. The price and quality ratio is really quite high here but to us, rooms must be air-conditioned unless you are talking about the period from November to mid March.

Third, the breakfast is substantial, if a bit boring because it does not change regularly. Also, while guests can make their own boiled eggs the hotel charges 10 euros for scrambled or fried eggs--that is a bit odd but I guess gthey do not want to bother with 'special' orders. Fourth, one can get a really good deal on one's room rate by booking and paying early. We got 30% off the standard rate which is not inconsequential. On the negative side, the hotel is in a very old building which needs work and the decor and fit and finish of the rooms needs improvemet. Everything looks its age. Perhaps an upgrade is in the works. They are dong some work on the outside of the building. Perhaps they will tackle the inside next.

We loved it. We travel extensively in Italy but were really being quite selective about where we stayed in Rome as we wanted a superior type of hotel without being in something overly extravagant. Equally we wanted to be away from traffic noise and stay somewhere with character. This hotel fitted our wishes. The hotel is, as many have commented, so well situated it is hard to imagine anywhere better. It is very central and it is amazing how quickly you can walk anywhere. The staff were helpful, the rooms were spotlessly clean and the shower was good - which is often not the case. The breakfast buffet was also very good. The hotel is situated on a beautiful, quiet piazza with numerous good restaurants in the area. I note the comment about access to the piazza. This is because your are near the government buildings and so the area is protected by police but taxi drivers seemed to be allowed through if they just told the police in the area they were headed for Hotel Nazionale. In any case the hotel offers you a limo service from the airport. It was 70 Euros whereas a taxi might have been say 40 odd euros but it was nice to be met at the airport and whisked stright through to the hotel without any hassle. Incidentally the limo driver offered to take us to the Systine Chapel the day after our arrival with \"no queues\"! We were a bit sceptical but he collected us on time and for an extra payment of 40 Euros he whisked us straight into the Vatican through the exit, paying some guards it seems (!) and straight into the very front of the building - the queues outside stretched literally for miles and it was the best 40 Euros we have ever spent - we felt a bit guilty but hey this was Rome! Clearly this is not unusual as the guards just viewed it as routine. A great hotel - not cheap - but if you can afford the rates - which are not extravagant - I think you will enjoy your stay and leave feeling happy that you booked.

Room 306 faced the Piazza Colonna/Parliament, had a sofa, upholstered chair, coffee table, queen-sized bed, a regular sized bathroom and room for a cot for an infant. Room 302 faced the back of the hotel, had a desk and chair, two upholstered chairs, twin beds, a roll away bed and a big bathroom (with a nice size soaking tub).

The breakfast buffet was good and offered something for everyone. The front desk staff made excellent recommendations for local restaurants and were able to provide directions to places nearby. The location of this hotel is top notch! Most of the major sites are within walking distance. Pushing two strollers, we walked to The Coliseum, The Vatican, Piazza Navona, the Pantheon, Campo D'Fiori, and the zoo (northern part of Villa Borghese). TIPS: 1. The hotel is located on a pedistrian only piazza next to Parliament and it seemed that the piazza has car restrictions at certain times of the day. We never figured out the \"rules\" but it looked like only cars with permission were allowed on the piazza between the hours of 8:00am and 5:00pm. Arriving from the airport, we found out the hard way that our car service could not drop us off in front of the hotel. The driver let us off at a side street and we had to drag our luggage (and strollers) around the perimeter of the piazza until we found a way accessible to wheeled luggage and strollers. 2.

Nazionale, however, looks out onto the piazza behind the Italian parliament building, which is extremely quiet at night, and patrolled by policemen, too. Quiet and safe. Good place for sleeping. The hotel itself was, well, fine. The common spaces are smallish, but quite nice. They gave us a free upgrade to a superior room, which had plenty of space, much of which was over our heads (the beautiful ceiling was at least 15 feet high). The antique furniture was lovely, if a little bit suboptimal in design. For example, a walk-in closet might have been nicer than the beautiful free-standing piece of furniture they offered. But one can't really complain about this sort of thing in a European hotel situated in a building that probably served some other purpose in the past. Above the desk there was a rather severe painting of a bare-chested young woman stabbing herself with a dagger under her right breast. We tried not to look at that just before retiring! Despite the abundant space available, our bed was a double, rather than a queen or king sized bed (why do they do this so often in Europe?) The air conditioning was a little bit weak, but not too bad. The bathroom was modern, and the plumbing worked just fine. The people working at the desk were friendly and helpful, and they spoke excellent English and other languages as well. We spent most of our time out of our room, and we weren't looking for many amenities. The hotel has a restaurant, in which I never saw a single person eating.

The shower curtain and tiles were moldy and human hairs (other than my own) were visible in various corners of the room. I booked this hotel on a 'stay three pay for two night special' but checked-out after the second night thereby giving up a free night stay in Rome. I just could not handle anymore bed bug bites. I found a wonderful hotel around the corner next to the Pantheon that provided the cleanliness and service you expect when paying 4 star rates. Aside from my brief stay at the Hotel Nazionale, I found Rome to be a beautiful, friendly and obviously an historically fascinating city. I am looking forward to returning to Rome soon.", "Date": "June 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cPretty good place\u201d", "Author": "TexasSooner", "ReviewID": "UR2063260", "Content": "We stayed here in May 2004 and we would stay there again.

Awesome location. Centrally located to everything. You can walk everywhere, even the Vatican (this is the secret to not gaining weight while in Italy eating all that gelato and other great food). The Pantheon is right around the corner (it was my favorite place in all of Rome--it's absolutely magical at night). Even though it is in a central location, the hotel is very QUIET in this bustling city. It is located off of the road right next to a piazza where the Parliament is. So, there is no car traffic that goes by the hotel. There are a lot of police around Parliament, so it keeps the noise down from any rowdy people walking by. Our room was large and so was the bathroom (in comparison to some other hotels we stayed at in Italy). We would definitely return to this hotel.", "Date": "May 5, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1758642", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for six nights at the beginning of March 2004.
