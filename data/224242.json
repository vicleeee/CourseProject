The price was fair considering the prices everywhere else and we had the luxury of a full refrigerator, microwave, stove, sink, cups, utensils, bowls and plates. The room was average, the bed a little stiff for me but my boyfriend had no problem with it. Good size bathroom with good lighting and A/C in the room. The room was clean and we were able to check-in an hour early. When we checked in there was no soap in the bathroom or kitchen so we had to ask the housekeeper down the hall who only had one on her cart and the box was mangled. The soap was unused so we took it. The people at the front desk were very nice when we checked in and let us check-out and hour later than normal check-out. My only real complaint would be that the walls seem a bit thin, especially if you have someone above you. Very early Sunday morning from 1:30 a.m. and until we checked out at noon, we could hear the people above us walking around; this didn't make for a very nice night's sleep.

This ES is clean, quiet, friendly, and conveniently located within a few miles of the SAN airport, the city center, and major tourist attractions (zoo, Balboa Park, Sea World, city beaches, Mission Valley shopping centers, etc.). Like other ES properties, each room includes a kitchen with basic cookware, china, and flatware for two people. This is a great benefit in those cities where restaurant food is either greasy or expensive. Like other ES properties, housekeeping is do-it-yourself, except for a once weekly cleaning and linen change (towels are exchangeable at the front desk daily). The room was clean, but showed food stains on the carpet around the dining table (the kitchen area has laminate flooring which should have included the table area). Like other ES properties, this motel is quiet because it does not have party or convention facilities to attract bridezillas or drunken parties. It is set back from the freeway, so traffic noise is a low hum. Because San Diego offers only rudimentary public transportation, a car is essential, but our Thrifty airport rental car was brand new and cost only $183 per week including all taxes and fees. There is nothing of interest within walking distance of this ES property. The problems we had were minor, but multiple. The front desk took care of most (except the plumbing problems) promptly and politely. There were no hangers for the coat rack. The china and flatware were missing a few items. The kitchen counter trim was coming off. The shower diverter and the tub drain did not function properly -- both leaked. Most important, the tub faucet did not turn off -- there was a constant flow of hot water which made the bathroom warm but damp. This was a pity in a city that has chronic water shortages. This leak was present on our arrival, but it was the only room available at the time, per the front desk. One suggestion for your stay in San Diego. Request a room above the ground floor since the climate is mild and you will want the option to sleep with open windows. Overall, we would stay here again.

If you really don't mind staying in a total dive, then this hotel is fine (really, it should be called a motel), just be prepared for what you will get: stained carpets, foul stench in the hallways, filth all over the cabinets/counters/fridge in a supposedly \"clean\" room, stained towels and bed linens, a phone that rarely works, no pans (you get 1 pot, 2 nasty plastic cups, 2 coffee cups, 2 small bowls, 2 plates, 1 butter knife, 1 \"steak\" knife, 2 forks, 1 large spoon and 1 small spoon), and no large bowls to prepare food in.

The doors are regularly propped open on the \"secured entry: doorways, so people can wander in and out as they please, and you need to watch where you step outside because most guests do not pick up after their pets. Be prepared to be bombarded with smoke every time you leave the hotel because people smoke in every doorway and in the stairwells. Lastly on the cons, over half of the washers AND dryers do not work... rather than having them repaired, the hotel just puts a print out that reads, \"Out of Order\" on them while more continue to break. We've been here for 2 months waiting to move into our condo and we've yet to see a single machine be fixed.

But they stuck me on the first floor across from housekeeping and literally a door away from the front desk. I heard every guest coming and going. The walls were paper thin so I heard TVs blaring late at night and people's loud, muffled voices at all hours. Housekeeping would start early in the morning yelling right outside my door, cluelessly greeting me with a smile when I exited. One morning they were vacuuming in the hallway outside my door beginning at 7:45 AM!! I tried to ignore it but finally called the front desk at 8:15 to ask why on earth they were vacuuming this early, and they said that it was after 8 AM. I have NEVER stayed any where that vacuumed that early.
