We awoke to bugs in the bed and bite marks on our bodies. We complained to the hotel manager...frankly he did not care. We had no idea what the bugs were but we were glad to get out of the very buggy Vagabond Inn.Days after we arrived home, I started being bit in my home...it turns out the bugs were bedbugs. They feed on human blood when you sleep (possibly transmitting disease) and travel in suitcases from buggy hotels and infest your home.At the least this has been a nightmare for 5 months!! I have had my home professionally exterminated several times (bedbugs are hard to get rid of). I have lost thousands of dollars in ruined furniture, rugs, bedding and clothing. The physical and mental toll has been costly. I've spent months without sleep, I've taken medication for the bite marks and started on anti anxiety medication to help cope with the entire ordeal.I contacted Manager of the Vagabond Inn Hollywood when I discovered the bugs had infested my home from his hotel, only days after returning home. At first he pretended he did not remember us speaking on the phone from my hotel room the morning I checked out to complain about the bugs. He also pretended he didn't remember my friend and I speaking with him again in person when we checked out. We spoke with him twice about bugs and being bitten in his hotel! And now only 10 days later he doesn't remember? When I asked to speak with the owner of the hotel or someone over him, he suddenly remembered our conversation. I asked for the owners name again, and he refused to give me any information... he was withholding and dishonest! And he said, \"I am not telling you anything, I am not giving you any information\"So, I did call the Vagabond Inn Corporation who offered me a free nights stay for my trouble. Are they kidding? The corporate office said there was nothing they could do since the Vagabond Inns are franchises and each franchise is responsible for how they manage their hotel.My advice...stay away from every Vagabond Inn. It is a violation when a hotel or motel does not provide a bug free environment to stay in. The Vagabond Inn Hollywood has very low standards and why should they do any better? The Corporation does not require them to.The Vagabond Inn Hollywood wasn't exactly cheap for a week nights stay at $85 per night. The minimum I expected was a clean, safe environment. I did not get that. With all of my complaints...I've been told I have no proof the bugs were in the Vagabond Inn. No proof? We woke up to bug bites on our bodies, bugs in the bed and we took a bug to the office to show the manager the bug and filed a complaint. How is that no proof? What I got was a nightmare, in the form of a physical, mental and financial toll. Stay away from Vagabond Inns...especially stay away from the Vagabond Inn Hollywood. They have bedbugs which carry disease and will infest your home.", "Date": "May 21, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Vagabond Inn Executive", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d223044-Reviews-Vagabond_Inn_Executive-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$76 - $135*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1133 Vine St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90038</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "223044", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/4e/ae/4eae89176eef8060e51d8a9e8deee5d86large.jpg"}}
