The room was on the same floor as the reception, right at the front of the building...next to the busy road, which was noisy (even at night). So after very little sleep, the next day we decided to ask if there were other rooms available - and we were moved very quickly, to a much nicer room; there was no traffic noise, the bathroom was bigger -there was a shower AND a bath and it had a newer television. Food-wise, the breakfast was lovely, there were breads, butter, ham, sweet croissants, cereal, orange juice and a really good tasting coffee! We had booked half-board, so our meal in the evening was mainly various pastas in a cheese or tomato sauce, followed by a second dish (I recommend the cheese selection, comes with little pot of honey) and a side order of either salad or baked potatoes. There was only one night where we had to go somewhere else to eat, so we ventured round the corner to a place called La Baita in Via Lucania - wonderful little restaurant with reasonable prices (when you consider how expensive Rome can be!) I had a big pizza which cost me about 7 or 8 euros. The hotel was well situated for us; the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, Villa Borghese, a couple of metro stations and a supermarket (called Conad) were in a walkable distance and we even got to the Colosseum in good time. We went to Vatican City on the metro - and found that the Spagna metro station was the most straightforward to get to from the hotel. In the end, we got what we were looking for from Hotel Priscilla - it isn't grand, but the staff are friendly and its just what you need if, like us, you spend pretty much all day exploring the city and want somewhere clean and comfortable to rest your head at night. The only downside was our first room next to the street.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holon, Israel", "Title": "\u201cEfficiency, not luxury. And great service.\u201d", "Author": "Gal V", "ReviewID": "UR126289676", "Content": "I have read trough alot of reviews on this hotel. some are good, but some are really bad. Here are some points to consider: - If you are looking for a luxurious hotel - pay more. Rome is exepensive. -Hotel priscilla is not that pretty, the quallity of the facilities may not be great. -YOU DO GET a decent SHOWER and BED, and your room will get CLEANED EVERY DAY. -You CAN walk to almost any site (Rome is for walking, don't like walking? get a bus tour...). -If you get a room facing the street, there will be some noise (Bearable, not recommended for light-sleepers). -EXCELENT SERVICE, something that's not very common in most of Rome. -WIFI costs 5EURO for the whole stay and DOES NOT work in the room. -Breakfast is there only to fill you up a little before a long day. Not that satisfying but thats how they do breakfast in Rome (A few pastries, some bread, some cheese and ham). -All in all as said here before - a great base to tour Rome from - Nothing more and nothing less. Stayed for four nights, here is the summary: DAY1: Arrived to the hotel at about 9PM, very tired from the flight. We were immidietly welcomed with the wounderful smile of ALEX at the recception. Check in was quick and efficient, and as we did it we also got maps and directions to the colliseom (Bus line 63 for less than 5 minutes and 5 more minutes of walking). Had dinner at the hotel restorant, not amazing but very nice. DAY2: Line 63 to the Vittorio Emanuelle monument (you can walk there, but I have planned a route including all the MUST SEE places that we could see in one day), colliseom, palatino hill and the roman forum (all three of them = one ticket - 12EURO Pp). That part took us about 6 hours including lunch at a restorant. Than we crossed the Tevere river trough the little island in the middle and had coffee on the other side - very peacefull and nice - Highly recommended. Crossed back at the next bridge walked to campo the fiori, piazza navona, pantehon, fontana the trevi and finally the spanish steps (try to plan your walking so you'll pass by all of the little pictures in the tourist map, it's worth it). Went back by foot. Spanish steps to Priscilla - 15 minutes if you take the streets ABOVE the steps. All in all, that day took us anout 10 hours. Dinner was at a nice restorant in the area of piazza salustio (few blocks from the hotel). DAY3:Bus line 490 from piazza Fiume (3 minutes behind the hotel) to Ottavino street and less than 5 minutes to the Vatican. About 2 hours in the Vatican museum, s.Pietro square and basilica. By foot to Castel S.Angelo (The amazing view from the top is worth alot more than the 5 euro ticket), than walking on the river side and passing trough Cavour bridge, than by foot to piazza del Popolo (the 3 streets heading in to the centro turrico are loaded with places for shopping, eating and even some pubs). Via del babuino took us back to the spanish steps and again to the hotel. 7 Walking hours that day. For dinner we went back to \"PizzaRe\", near piazza del Popolo - very nice place. DAY4: That day was just about Roaming the streets of Rome (Sorry about the stupid pon). Started walking twards the termini station, the republica square is beatiful but not alot to do and not a very nice area. Had lunch at \"Aramando Al Pantheon\" a nice small place we were lucky enogh to get the last table that was not reserved ! It's just in front of the pantheon but it's sure not a tourist restorant (Stay away from these Usually they have English signs and people outside offering you to eat there as you walk by, food is OK but it's not great as the food in the less touristic places). That day took us about 6 hours of walking. For dinner we went to \"Ristorante il Rifugio del Buttero\" (if you face the hotels restorant it's the second resorant to the left). The only thing that we were sorry about is not going there for every lunch and dinner ! It is a very nice restorant/wine bar, not too exepensive and the food was simpley AMAZING ! Aspecially the beef T-bone steak. On day 5 we got up earlly had breakfast and straight to the airport (flight was at noon). So, as you can see me and my gf can walk alot, we're in our earlly 20's. If thats not your king of tour you might consider paying extra for a closser hotel. For us, this hotel was all we needed. Again I want to mention the great great service by all of the staff (And I work at a 5 stars hotel in Israel so I know good service when I see it) and a special thanks to ALEX which was very helpful and nice!

The hotel has a nice reception, mediocre bed rooms with single beds that don't leave much room for turning over in. It has the tiniest shower (can fit you with about an inch either side) and not much more room for anything else.

I booked this hotel based on trip advisor reviews only to show up and realize that it is OBVIOUS that the staff is writing FAKE positive reviews. This place does NOT deserve the label \"hotel\"- this is a motel at best (and that's being generous). Save your money and stay at a free hostel for the same quality.

On the whole though the staff were extrememly helpful and spoke good english and helped with our luggage when we arrived. They always smiled and were pleased to help with any little question. The room (119) was in desperate need of updating with staining and peeling paint. Bedsheets were clean but very worn as was the furniture. Yes I know it doesn't matter that much on a short trip when you're out most of the day but you can't escape the fact it's a bit grim. Shower was good and hot so no complaints there. Appeared to be air con but this didn't work either - the room was far too hot and we struggled to get the temperature down, so we slept on top of the sheets. The location is of the hotel is fine, situated on the north east part of the city, but everything is accessible on foot - we managed to get to Vatican City and back in a day, with a pushchair, and see loads in between (Trevi, Pantheon etc).

By the time we passed through customs, and traffic getting to the hotel, it was around 9-10am. Although our room was not ready, we were able to leave our bags in the lobby and were encouraged to explore the city. Check in was very friendly and the man at the reception desk was very friendly and gave us a map of the city. When we arrived back to the hotel at 11:30, he informed us that our room was ready. Our room was on the same floor as the lobby. I thought it was large for European standards! The bathroom was standard, sink, toliet, and a stand up single stall shower. Our room had a tv, we did not turn it on even once, we were in Rome on our honeymoon! The bed was hard as a rock, but again, I think this is a Eurpoean thing, wasn't concerned. We purchased the wifi for the week at a flat 5 Euros. The wifi didn't work in our room, but we did have a very strong signal right outside our door, so I sat on the bench right outside our room most mornings while my husband was getting ready and sent e-mails home. The housekeeping always did a fine job, we had no difficulties with them. The front desk staff was great, there was the man who checked us in the first day, a lady and an older gentleman. We had no problems with any of them except the older gentleman on the last day who gave me problems when trying to settle up on our final bill. We owed a total of 25 Euros, 5 from the wifi, and then the 2 Euro fee per person per day for 5 nights = 25Euros. They had the Visa logo posted right on their front desk, however he tried to tell me they didn't accept Visa, just cash. At that point, we only had enough Euros to tip the driver taking us to the airport, so it was the Visa or US Dollars. Finally, once my husband came into the reception area he backed down and took our Visa. The other 2 reception staff members were always very helpful helping us with which bus routes to take, and where to buy bus passes. Their English was very good as well. Rome seemed very big looking on the map, but once we were there walking around for a few days, we realized that it isn't too large, and most things are within walking distance as long as you have the time. We walked to the Spanish Steps, Trevi, Down to the Victor Emanuelle Monument (the wedding cake), Piazza Navona as well as Piazza del Popolo. The restaurant connected to the hotel was AMAZING! Truely the best food we'd ever tasted, and a great welcome on our first night in Rome. Unfortunatley, when we went to pay and tried using our Visa, we were given a hard time there as well, and ultimately ended up using 90 of the 130 Euros that we had budgeted for the whole trip since they wouldn't take the Visa. Knowing now what we didn't know then, we'd bring more cash, and not plan on using our Visa. We figured the Visa would be a better option as it is quick, and Visa woud take care of the exchange rate.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Runcorn, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cI would go back!\u201d", "Author": "funkygibbon32", "ReviewID": "UR119582933", "Content": "I was a little sceptical about arriving at this hotel after reading the reviews on here. However, I found the hotel to be charming. The reception staff were very friendly and perfect English which helped, as my Italian is less than poor! I was travelling with friends, and I had been allocated a single room. We had to laugh when I opened the door, as my room was really, really small with a single bed and bathroom. I found it comfortable enough for what I needed, as I was only there to sleep and shower. The walls have been decorated, but the main problem I noticed with the so called dirty walls, was that I could see where people had put dirty suitcases on the beds, and then rested them against the walls, so not really the managements fault. The rest of the room was clean, with a small fridge. The view overlooked a residential courtyard and had very little natural light. We had breakfast included in our package, which consisted of tea/coffee, cereals, juices, croissants, bread, ham and cheese. Which was enough for us. The lady who is in charge of the breakfast room was really nice, and welcoming and made a fuss of the child in our group. The hotel is conveniently located, a Conad supermarket is 5 - 10 min walk away, and the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain about 15 min walk away. We booked tickets on the Roma Cristiana hop on/off bus tour. 21euro for 48 hours and free for children. This tour stopped at all of the main attractions, and in my opinion the best way to see the city. Rome itself is a fascinating city, with lots to do and see. However, it is very expensive to eat and drink. We went to Piazza Navona, which is a lovely square, but very touristy, hence the prices. We shared a ham and cheese pizza, and had a bottle of water, and I had a 2 pint glass of beer, and it came to just under 50euros. Needless to say, it was the most sober I have been on a holiday. I would certainly go back to Hotel Priscilla. All in all, a friendly family run hotel, in a handy location.

The sheets and towels were spotless and each day the room was cleaned really well. Unfortunately, the room's walls were the scruffiest I have seen, the decor was ancient and there was a really unacceptable level of noise from the street due to poorly performing 'double glazed' windows.

Luckily, they moved me upstairs to a very nice and large room that must have recently been refurbished (was a triple room with king bed and 1 single). It was like being in a different hotel all together! So, beware of what room you book and it's probably worth paying more for a better room. There was some street noise since my room was facing the road but the AC worked well so I kept the windows closed and had a good night's sleep. As for location, it is not in the exact centre of town but it is close enough to get to all sights. Just about 20 minute walk to the top of the Spanish Steps and about 15 minutes or so to Villa Borghese.

Our flight in was late arriving, and by the time we'd transferred, it was very late. The receptionist wasn't at allbothered by this, was expecting us, and made us feel very welcome. Our 3rd floor room was small, and so too the double bed - which had one side hard up against the wall, the room was so small. But it was clean, the toilet and shower worked, so too, the refrigerator and the TV, although we weren't in Rome to watch Italian TV. As it is the end of March, and although the temperature hit 22 degrees over the weekend, we didn't need the Aircon, didn't even try to see if it worked; assumed it did, although the plastic casing was badly cracked. The room was attended to every day, bed made, cleaned, new towels etc, and an extra pillow arrived quite soon after we asked for it. Breakfast was as expected, although one day, when it was busy, the room (being small) was difficult to manouvre past tables. The breakfast menu offered was typically European, as in not English, but it suited us -self service, cereal, fruit juice, coffee cheese, ham, toast ,breads etc The female member of staff gave the impression she woulkd rather be some where else though, but she was always busy, keeping the plates etc full. The guys on reception were always helpful when asked for information, and especially when we were trying to confirm our homeward flights and print boarding passes. We used the Hotel restuarant just once, on our last night in Rome. The young waiter here was superb! He spoke at least four languages, had a senese of humour and couldn't have been more helpful. I had been trying to find out where I could eat a particular dish in Rome called La pajata, which the receptionist hadn't heard of. I later found out that it has been widely discouraged and is rarely offered in restaurants anymore, and in any case, is usually found in more rural parts. The receptionist rang the chef there and then ( a lady, who did know of the dish), said she'd call back to confirm if she had the ingredients. She didn't, but offered some other delicacy I can't remember the name of, but it doesn't matter - the lady cooked something especially for me that wasn't on the menu, and was priced very reasonably. The hotel's location is a little way out from the centre of Rome, but we walked in every day. It's about 15-20 minutes to the Spanish Steps, half an hour to the Trevi fountain, Pantheon, Colloseo etc. The Vatican is walkable, but is over the river.....we walked back, but took a taxi there and arrived within 15 muinutes. I've given our view of the Hotel Priscilla, \"warts and all\". Don't be put off, by anything we;ve said, even if it sounds a little negative.......it's a budget, 3 star hotel, it's cheap, it's clean, it's got reliable staff, it's comfortable. A useful place to provide a bed for the night, a breakfast to start the day......and an excellent meal in the evening, if you want it.. We'd stay again.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cnot well\u201d", "Author": "Mioannis", "ReviewID": "UR98622298", "Content": "When we arrived in hotel , the man of reception gave us a room which was room for one night stand ( just for little time,not to stay) it was dirty,the blanket had a hole from cigarette and everything there were dirty,the bathroom,the tapet,the fridge was destroyed and was smelling.everything.when we demanded to change room because we did not like it the receptionist told us to tell the morning to the other receptionist lies,that the room is not quiet and has lot of voice.

The air conditioning in our room was not working at all for one day (it was in August and the daily temps were over 40 degrees celsius) and this was extremely uncomfortable as we have 2 children. The staff could not care less. They stated that the people in our room prior to us had not complained and that the hotel was fully booked and we would not be able to change rooms. In addition to this our refrigerator was not working properly. We had gone to the supermarket and picked up some groceries like yogurt and cheese for the kids and they were about to spoil. Again the response to our complaint was that it was working properly. In addition to this there was no volume on the television for some channels. Our children were trying to watch cartoons and there was no volume on the channels that they wanted to watch. Again the staff insisted that everything was working fine. Please keep in mind that while were trying to resolve all of these issues we had wasted one day of our valuable vacation time. We were only in Rome for 3 nights and an entire day was wasted trying to have these problems resolved. On the final day we asked that we be allowed a late check out of an hour or two, however this request was refused. The staff could not care less as to how displeased we were and did nothing to try to rectify the situation. When we asked to speak with the owner or director of the hotel we were told they could not be contacted but that the director would arrive at the hotel between 1 and 2 p.m. on that day. We checked out of our room on time and left our luggage in your lobby which we trusted would be in safekeeping. We returned at around 2 p.m. only to be advised that the director was not coming in that afternoon and that she was never expected to come in that afternoon. Obviously we were told a lie just so that the employee of that morning could get us out of his hair. In addition to all of the above referenced problems we came to realize that some of our jackets which were in the outside pockets of our luggage were stolen during that time that they were in the lobby and under the so-called supervision of the employees. We e-mailed the owner about our complaints to which his reply was there were no problems with our room. We paid for an air conditioned room, with a working fridge and working television. We did not receive a room with air conditioning, working fridge or working television. We obviously did not get what we had paid for. The owner's response to our complaint was that he was sorry we didn't like the service.

The previous reviews posted were right in some respects (rooms at front are noisy) but way off in others. We have just returned from a four night break and have had no complaints whatsoever. The only thing I would say is the hot water takes a while to come through. However, once it does it is piping and plentiful. The staff were friendly and unobtrusive. The decor is a little tired (find me a hotel of this standard that isn't!) but the rooms, bathrooms and public areas were absolutely spotless. The breakfast room is tiny but breakfast can be served in your room at no extra charge. My dad was going to take just a coffee up to my mum one morning but the waitress insisted on taking her a tray including fresh rolls, various jams and cheeses plus said coffee. Avoid the American coffee and hot milk and ask for cappuccino. Tea and hot chocolate are also available on request. We can also recommend a cafe/bar across the road which serves an excellent coffee and sweet pastry for only one and a half euros. Several reviews have said that the hotel is a fair distance from the main tourist attractions. This is true but we found that we benefited from this in so far as the local restaurants and bars were more reasonably priced. The price we paid for an excellent quality meal with wine for four varied from between 65 and 100 euros. The Pizzeria La Baita which is just around the corner was particularly good. The hotel is a 15 minute walk (we timed it) from Termini station where you can catch the metro. However, we found that taxis were convenient, plentiful and surprisingly cheap. A taxi from the hotel to the Trevi fountain one evening was only 7 euros.
