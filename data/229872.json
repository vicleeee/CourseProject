Then, when I pressed them, they totally changed their story and said that it was an ongoing problem, and that there had been several other thefts in the past few days.

We weren't wrong when we arrived, that is until we got up to our room. It was small, which I can cope with but like an oven as there appeared to be no air conditioning or any other way of cooling it down. Well I opened the window and the door that went into a little area within the building. Sadly there was a dank stench almost sewage like, but don't think it was, and one little airconditioning unit that must of been for another hotel or room within ours. Bathroom was clean, as was the room although there was a cigarette burn on the beds oversheet. The people on reception couldn't be more helpful, recommending places to eat, phoning the reccomendations to see if we needed to book, helped us get online with their wi-fi and even sourced us a taxi on the morning. The room really let the rest of the hotel down but am sure that there were other rooms that were a lot nicer. Perhaps it was our own fault for not asking to move, however I felt for one night it wouldn't make a difference. The location is handy for the Gothic area and La Rambla.

Some of our problems - bed very uncomfortable. Room tiny. Lino floor which looked unclean. Hole in the bathroom door. Bath you could only sqaut in (half normal size).

The rooms are very basic and a little tatty now with tatty laminate flooring and basic furniture but our two rooms were clean, as were the bathrooms. Everyone on the desk were helpful except for one guy in the afternoon who was a bit on the grumpy side to say the least. He could not find the key we had handed in and with a big que forming he got stroppy and said it was our problem to sort out not his! He then looked again after we wrote the room number down and he found the key. He apologised but had shown dreadful customer service. However on the other hand, on arriving I could not genuinly remember if I had paid upfront or pay on arrival. The chap very pleasantly explained that he thought it would be on arrival and suggested i rang on the hotel phone to England to confirm that i needed to pay on arrival. He was right and i paid 200 Euro in total for two rooms for two nights. During our stay the staff searched out restaurants for me on the internet and suggested discounted ways to buy Tourist Bus tickets and Camp Nou tickets. I think that 200 Euro for 4 people for 2 nights is very reasonable for the centre of Barcelona especially during school holidays. I am certain that you get much better hotels even in that location but I wanted an easy start to the holiday by knowing were i was going with an easy walk from the Airport bus. I emailed ahead of our stay saying we were repeat guests and could we have two nice rooms at the front. They replied and duly arranged! The shilling bar next door is a smart bar/Tapas and welcomes families and there is also a fantastic genuine Tapas bar with an amazing selection of Tapas displayed approx 5 doors up from this hotel. Cullertas restaurant (the oldest in Barcelona) is within metres and so is La Fonda another fabulous place we ate at. I reccomend the place if you are happy with basic accommodation in an excellent location. I enjoy 5* beach holiday accommodation but can equally recognise the appeal of this basic 1* style place!

During the day, the surrounding area is fine and pleasant but at night there are prostitutes and drug dealers all around, with vomit on every corner. We arrived late and even though we thought the hotel didn't look particularly secure (pretty flimsy locks on the room doors and again, rough part of town) we decided to stay. Bad mistake. When we arrived we were warned about thieves on the streets, told that the neighborhood was known for pickpockets, and told not to carry around any unnecessary cash or IDs, etc. We followed this advice and even though we never had much cash, we did leave some tucked away in the bags in the room. Our last night there, we returned to find the money stolen, around $80. That in and of itself would not have been the hotels fault, but to complicate matters the hotel required us to leave the key at the front desk when we were out. So it could have been someone from the hotel. Or it just as easily could have been someone from the street who walked in, since they never check ID when you ask for the key and I never saw the same person at the front desk -- i.e., I walked up and told him/her my room number and without any way of verifying that it was me they gave me the key. The attendant immediately started launching into an explanation about how he couldn't believe this had happened again, people had been losing money from their room for a week and they thought that someone posing as a guest was picking locks and then immediately changed his story when I got mad because THEY KNEW THAT ROOMS WERE BEING BROKEN INTO AND NO ONE HAD WARNED US. They didn't say a thing. He then told us we must immediately (it was midnight) go to the police station and report it, couldn't wait until the morning, and the hotel insurance would cover the theft if we had a police report. So we went, put my Spanish skills to the test filing the report, and returned at 2:30 in the morning with the report. Next morning, a new guy told me that there was no way the hotel insurance could cover an amount so small and that the police report wasn't good for anything. When I asked about a partial refund -- since they did have the key in their possession when the money was taken -- he said there was no way, refused to call the manager, and said they weren't going to do anything else to warn other guests. That was a lot of words to say: the hotel is unsafe, the hotel management didn't tell guests that they knew a thief was robbing rooms, they changed their story and lied to my face when they realized they had just incriminated themselves, and sent me to the police station in the middle of the night for nothing. Worst hotel I've ever stayed at and I've traveled to some very sketchy and low-budget hotels all over Latin America and Europe. I'm usually very easy-going, don't have high expectations at all, and if the manager had come up to me and said I'm so sorry, here is a 25% refund and we will alert other guests until we get this figured out, I would have left pacified. As it was, I left livid.

Breakfast was good for a 2 star hotel, with fresh bread, cheese, cold cuts, cereals, jams ecc. There is also a machine which serves hot drinks, so the product is consistent. The only problem is that the area can be noisy at night and you can expect it since it is in a busy area and in front of it there is a pub, however I cannot complain about not sleeping all night long.

If God were writing a trip advisor review of the Familia Sagrada he would extol its virtues and give it an excellent rating. But I am not God and I stayed in a far more down to earth establishment - the Hotel Adagio just off La Rambla. I was on a lone visit and the room was small despite having a good size double bed which at first seemed rather hardish but afforded good rest qualities. The room was simply decorated and the furniture was in keeping with the ambience - perfectly adequate for my short stay with a large wardrobe with plenty of shelf space. It would be unjust to judge the adequacy for a couple staying at the hotel because I booked a single room but the room I stayed in would have been rather too cramped for more than one - even if the couple were on exceptionally good terms! Other rooms might well have been bigger. The room had a veranda which looked out onto an extremely narrow street - one hopes that the person living opposite would not peer down from the balcony at the same time otherwise heads might bump - no not that bad but certainly 'intimate'! By the way, no sign of druggies or ladies of the night as mentioned in another review( not that I was looking for either!). The bathroom was small but very clean. The shower was fine - powerful and with temperature control easily achieved. Interestingly, the shower appeared to double as a bath which was adequate for a child until they understood the meaning of the term NSPCC. But then a family would not have been staying in this room. Bed linen, towels, room cleanliness were all of an exceptionally hight level and I really must commned the lovely ladies who kept the room spotless and were very civil and happy to smile. Well done Adagio! The reception staff were excellent - and I use the term advisedly. They were friendly, courteous, smart, helpful and all I encountered spoke excellent English. Very commendable indeed. They were happy to print out my priority Ryanair boarding pass for my return flight - free!! There was a continuous humming from the heating/ac system which took a while to get used to but I mention this only in passing. Walls seemed rather thin and conversation could be heard from adjoining rooms. Television had CNN and plenty of indigenous channels. Breakfast was typically continental - croissants, buns, cereal, jams, meats, cheese and a good selection of hot and cold drinks. It was rather more limited in variety than other hotels I have stayed in but a perfectly adequate start to the day and for the price paid I got this hotel at a bargain price and quite frankly, I'd be happy to stay again. It is central and immaculately clean with a friendly staff. f you sleep lightly then you might want to look elsewhere - the noise is not the fault of the hotel, just the result of its location. It's a 2 star tourist hotel so don't expect the Ritz but for someone like me on a tight budget I can recommend this hotel as an ideal base for Barcelona.

And I was right. This hotel is conveniently located close to all major attractions on my visiting list. Before I arrived I was a bit worried after having read somewhere that this hotel is located in the red-light district. But what a wonderful lively area it was, full with activities, people, bars, restaurants. So my worry disappeared right away. The only problem was the street Ferran is mostly pedestrian and not open for traffic, that was what my taxi driver told me, who left me at the city hall square from where I have to drag my luggage to the hotel, about 3-5 minutes. But it was really not a problem. I booked a single room, clean, quiet, basic. The TV did not work. But I didn't come here to watch BBC anyway. The bathroom was perfect, no problem with leaking water or drainage. My father's room has a window facing a horrible looking well so he had the curtain down all the time. My room window is facing a small side street, very quiet. The breakfast was basic, toast, juice from the machine, and coffee. I read that there was free wifi internet available, and it turned out only the laptop computer in the lobby was connected. And there was only one so you have to queue.

We booked a triple room through a UK-based hotel company, but were given a single-size room with 3 beds in that you could not walk around and, in order to open the window or watch TV you had to move one of them each time. To negotiate the toilet in the bathroom you had to squeeze past the wash basin. There was 'air conditioning' that came out of only part of the battered unit and was totally useless, and the bedding was dirty, plus, there were fire hazard ceiling tiles which would not be allowed in the UK. It was dark and unkempt and totoally unwelcoming. When we asked for another room, the reception guy just shrugged his shoulders and said to get another hotel which, with the help of our booking company, we did, but we had to sleep in this awful hotel overnight first, which was very hot and smelly. The breakfast consisted of a few tasteless and dry pastries, nothing hot at all, and was presided over by an equally unfriendly old woman, who didn't acknowledge us or smile once. Knowing that we were moving out, the hotel would not let us stay until we could check in later that afternoon- even though we had paid for 6 nights - as they said they had already given our room to someone else. No wonder then, that we were so pleased to see the back of the place and move to a 4-star hotel further up, in the much nicer Modernista area. We had chosen La Rambla as our base, due to having our son with us, and my current mobility problem, so it was an inconvenience to us to move hotels but, given the cirumstances, we had no choice, and we were able to see a lot of Gaudi's buildings close by. We have stayed in a lot of hotels and understand that this is only a 2-star, but the state of the hotel and unfriendliness makes it the worst. Our booking company said they were going to remove the Adagio from their list, which is very wise. It might be OK for single, young packpackers, but for a family it is hopelessly inadequate. On a general point about Barcelona: In high summer, it is very busy, noisy and stinks, due to the poor drainage. Plus, the service is generally very slow. However, we did not experience any of the pickpockets we had read about, thankfully. Tip: Don't waste your money on the boat trips, the scenery isn't exactly stunning and the glass bottom aspect only works when it's tied up in the harbour beforehand. DO go on a city tour on a bus turistic and get a feel for what Barca has to offer, then you can return. And, finally, make an early start, because every attraction gets packed by midday, especially the tram and funicular railway up to the Tibidabo mountian (which has a great theme park at the top, next to a magnificent church with giant statue of Christ).", "Date": "August 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cNearly Perfect\u201d", "Author": "hmlaw88", "ReviewID": "UR5414470", "Content": "Stayed in Adagio in Mid JUN 2006.
