We visited the the hotel prior to making a booking and found everything to be satisfactory. The next day we booked a junior suite for four nights, and we checked in the following day. Some of the guest writing reviews here complain about the charming elevator from 1912. These type of elevators are common in the orginal buildings of the same age and is the only posssible way of maing an elevator without chaning the structure. We find them charming and cosy. After checking in, we found ourselves on the top floor in a small room facing the National Assemby. The view was in a small window 1,8 meters above the floor. The celing was at about 2,1 meters.

Pentecote.

It was in a quiet district in the heart of what I call \"Business-Land\" ie not many shops, bistros, cafes about, mainly Office/State buildings. The hotel was in excellent condition having been re-furbed lately. Everything seemed new and it was very clean. The room (a standard double) was small but adequate but I have to say I have never slept on such a hard mattress in all my life! Plus the sheets (flat, not fitted) kept on slipping on the polyester mattress cover making for a rather fidgety night as they bunched up underneath whenever we moved. The room had a mini bar fridge, wi-fi, kettle, TV and safe so everything you need, along with a huge double shower. We didn't eat breakfast in so I cannot comment on that. The lady at reception was very very accommodating and eager to help...she booked a restaurant table for us and gave us any info we needed quickly and without fuss. She made us feel very welcome so well done to the front desk\u2026same for the man who did the later shift! I have no complaints about the hotel. Maybe next time though I think I\u2019d like to be a little closer to the action with a good choice of bistro\u2019s etc close by rather than having to walk at least 15 mins or so\u2026but having said that, chances are that hotel would not be in such a quiet area with such sights on the door step!

We had booked the Hotel de Varenne, which is up the street but due to some booking problems in the middle of the high season, when we reached the Varenne, we were told that they had to make a booking for us at this hotel. We were skeptical at first, especially because Hotel de Varenne was very high in the TA ratings and was the reason why we had chosen it. We had no other option but to say yes to moving to the Bourgogne et Montana (the name of the hotel is definitely a mouthful and not very easy to remember) considering the rate that was given to us was the same as at the Varenne. We walked in a little bit uneasy considering we had no clue about the hotel except as were told it was a 4 star. We had stayed in the Varenne for 3 nights previously and so we did have a benchmark to compare right on the same street. We found the Bourgogne et Montana to be much better equipped than the Varenne (they are a 4 star vs. Varenne a 3 star, so that plays a role). The room was bigger, the bathroom was bigger, the amenities offered were more and quite frankly we had a better stay at this place than at the Varenne, which by the 3 star standards in Paris, is pretty decent (that is for another review). We had one issue with the shower not working properly (our mistake, not the hotel's) but they had no problem in sending someone to our room who explained what was wrong with a smile on her face. The breakfast offered was much better than the breakfast we have had at other hotels in Paris. The staff at the front desk was pleasant all through our stay. All in all - I am very surprised at the negative reviews for this hotel. Considering this is in a great location (very central and yet not very crowded) in Paris and we paid an okay amount for the high season - we had a pretty satisfying stay there.

It is also super convenient for so many museums, and of course very close to the river and Place Concorde. We arrived from Australia early in the morning on the 24th April. As expected, our room of course at such an early hour - it was only about 8.30 in the morning - but our luggage was stored and we were shown a lounge where we could freshen up and relax and were advised that our room could be made ready for us by 10.30. That was great news. Of course, Paris waited and so we had a quick freshen up and then walked the short distance down to the river, across the bridge and into the Tuileries to just remind ourselves that we were back in our favourite city. When we returned to the hotel it was probably about 11.00, and our room was ready. We had booked a premier executive, but then found that we had been upgraded to a junior suite. It was lovely. Quiet, comfortable, restful and roomy, with the most superb round stained glass windows - so very Paris. The bed was fantastic. Was there something which we could fault? Oh yes, no shower screen or curtain, and so, as has been mentioned before, the bathroom became rather flooded when you took a shower. That is a pretty minor problem, and one which the hotel can easily overcome. The breakfast, which was included in our excellent advance purchase rate, was great. As well as the usual cereal, yoghurt, pastries, there was bacon and eggs, and the bacon was just delicious. We couldn't fault the breakfast. Members here have commented on the unfriendly staff. We didn't find that to be the case at all. We did find that most of the staff were very professional, and perhaps in a way quite different to staff in Australian or American hotels. Give me an unsmiling professional over a I'm-your-new-best-friend slightly incompetent person anyday. After three nights in the hotel we were heading down to Bordeaux for 10 days, and so we left some of our luggage at the hotel to collect later. This was handled in a professional way, and kept in such a way that it was secure and we had no cause to worry about it, and when we called back to collect it after our trip south we were actually escorted to the luggage room, a little point I found very reassuring.

Just across the Seine from the hotel you reach the Place de la Concorde (5 mins). If you walk 10 mins to the East you reach the famous Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00c3\u00a9s. Three metro stations nearby: Invalides, Assembl\u00c3\u00a9e Nationale & Solf\u00c3\u00a9rino. The breakfast is included in the room rate and offers a good choice of food and drinks. Employees at the reception desk are very friendly! Now the small list of negatives: 1. The very old elevator was out of service (again!) for the whole three days, which is quite annoying when you walk around Paris all day and need to go to your room on the 4th floor. 2. All rooms have a bathtub, NO showers, and I definitely prefer to use showers in hotels. 3. Room noise insulation is not great, which is quite typical in large city hotels.

The elevator, a box that could just fit two adults WITHOUT suitcases broke during the first day of our stay. with a room on the 6th floor, we had to walk up and down the narrow and uneven staircase. Apparently the ancient elevator would not function for another few weeks. Our room absolutely reeked of some cheesy incense, probably sprayed to cover the musky smell that was noticeable. there was also a scent of cigarettes that might've been coming from the air conditioning. speaking of which, there was no way to turn off the AC nor adjust the speed, which meant that it was blowing at full blast through the vents right above the bed. The room was right next to a maintenance storage, which meant that there was constant noise from early on in the morning. Also, apparently the exterior of the building was being renovated at one side, meaning there were very loud sounds of constructions through out the day. Housekeeping seemed to leave room doors open when cleaning them, so I actually caught a glimpse of several different types of rooms when walking down the stairwell. seems like some were more nice looking where as others looked very washed out. Overall, the only things that made my stay here memorable were the strong odor, endless stairs and loud construction noises. not exactly the most pleasurable stay.

We booked an \"executive room\" through their website, primarily because we got such a great deal. Well, everyone else evidently booked this special, too, and the managers couldn't seem to keep up with the traffic. When we arrived in the afternoon from the train station, the lobby was full of people, and it took two people behind the desk to attend to one customer (this was true throughout the trip). When we finally got to the desk to check in, a frazzled woman behind the desk greeted us by saying \"you should be thankful your room is already cleaned.\" (!) We were then notified that we had been \"upgraded\" to a suite on the first floor. The room itself was huge--we even had a extra WC--but the ceilings were really low and there were two tiny windows that looked out onto a courtyard that was above the room, giving the room the feel of a basement apartment (it's room 17, by the way, in case you want to avoid it). When we inquired as to whether there was a room with more windows, even if it meant a smaller space, we were told that \"all of the rooms have those windows.\" So, I can only assume that if you are taller than 6ft or claustrophobic, that no room at this hotel is suitable for you. In a town like Paris, I can accept the fact that rooms are strange. What I had trouble with was that the hotel was so poorly managed. A request for a wake up call was missed the morning of our flight. The concierge assured us she had made reservations at a local bistro, and when we showed up, there was clearly no reservation. The starting price for a room according to a board posted in the lobby, is 200 Euros. For this, you should be able to get a wake up call and a room with sunlight. The breakfast was fine, but the quality of food wasn't what we had been having during our stay in France. (I'll make an exception for the raisin rolls--quite yummy!, but not the lukewarm yogurt). The location is decent and highly walkable to many areas of Paris. You are in a more residential area, so if you are hoping to be steps away from lively cafes and restaurants, you may want to look in the 5th, 6th, 3rd or 4th. But, the cafe by the Assemblies National is a good place for a pre-dinner drink. Also, you are about a 5-min walk from the Assemblies metro and if you walk a few minutes further over the river, you can hit the Concord stop, which has a few more lines. If you need a taxi from your hotel, you are better off walking to a main street. It takes the hotel about 20 minutes to call one for you (so plan ahead if you are going to the train station or airport). If this hotel could be run better, it might be a gem, but given it's location and cave-like rooms, there is no way I would ever recommend this to anyone.

The bed is a standard double (4'6\" or 1.50m) and the area is cosy, but has quite a bit of storage. The bathroom is a reasonable size and nicely fitted out (except that the absence of shower screen/curtain, as is the French way, takes some getting used to). It takes a moment to realise that the curtains in the room are for decoration, and that the way to block the light is to lower blinds which are outside the windows. The TV is small, and only had one functioning channel in English (CNN), but then I guess not many people go to Paris to watch TV. We didn't take breakfast so can't comment on that, but we did discover how cheap food and wine is in French supermarkets, so we bought our own supper/breakfast and kept it in the minibar fridge, which had plenty of room. The lift up to the rooms is an amazing old device, and big enough only for two people without luggage or one with, but it seems very safe. The service was very good throughout our stay - my attempts at French were humoured and where comprehension failed all the staff had enough English for us to communicate effectively. There were a couple of minor issues with the room when we checked in (the previous guest had left the safe locked open, and a couple of lights weren't working) but these were all fixed very promptly once we notified the front desk. The room was clean and the servicing was very efficient, and done even when we didn't leave the room until well into the afternoon.

The issue with of there not being a shower-curtain was not a big deal (best to hold the shower-head). The room was also serviced very nicely each day and, very imporantly, the mini-bar was restocked, with fairly reasonably priced drinks! We booked B&B, however, we missed breakfast every day.

In fact, we found the staff very friendly and helpful. Although, we would recommend that if you indeed to book tickets for anything to do it yourself.

The staff was exceptionally friendly, and all spoke English. They went out of their way to assist in any way possible. The guest rooms, restaurant, and lobby areas were immaculate! The bird-cage elevator truly is part of the charm and experience. This is an exceptional hotel, and an amazing value for the money.

Walking distance to the Hotel Crillion. Small somewhat elegantly/tastfully decorated hotel. Cons: Elevator only holds one person with no luggage; felt somewhat isolated from the action of Paris; room had a view of the roof of the next building; breakfast is very basic and very expensive; staff does not offer to help with anything unless you ask (no help with luggage, etc, even when they are standing a few feet away) Staff seem to be annoyed when asked anything.

It is in a beautiful neighborhood. However, it is rather expensive. The breakfast,which is included in the price of the room, is of poor quality. We would have rather gone out to a local cafe than eaten at the hotel(which we,in fact, started doing after a couple of days). The rooms were clean; and the beds were comfortable.
