{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice hotel for the price I stayed here in December 2007. I booked this hotel through the hotel web site. I found it slightly cheaper at another site. I filled out the hotel's online best rates guarantee form and did get 10% off the lower price. Nice feature! The room was clean and a nice size (studio with queen bed). The bed was hard though and the room could have used more noise insulation. You could hear people talking outside and in other rooms. The room had a nice size refrigerator and everything else necessary to prepare a meal. They give you soap for washing hands and taking a shower though it would have been nice to have dish washing soap to wash dishes. The location of the hotel was convenient and I would stay here again.", "Date": "Dec 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR855569511", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "MinnesotaVisitor"}, {"Content": "I would never check-in here again. I was in Chandler on a business trip. Travel agency booked my stay for 9 nights at the Wellesley Inn due to no vacancy at other suite-type hotels (Residence, Summerfield, etc.). The Wellesley Inn parking lot was filled mostly with semi-tractors, motorcycles, old pick-ups, etc. So, I was uncomfortable concerning security. I purchased some groceries for breakfasts, slept the first night, and worked long hours the next day. I kept my suitcase and laptop with me during the day. Upon my return to the Wellesley for my second night, my room key didn't work. Why? Because these idiots had cleaned-out my room (threw away the groceries) and rented the room to another person who was asleep inside!! I had never checked out!! They said sorry, we have other rooms available, would you like another? Shocked and upset, I declined, and went searching for other accommodations (at 11PM at night). I have traveled on business over 20 years, and never had anything like this happen before. I guarantee that I will never check-in to this place in the future.", "Date": "Jul 8, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR175094142", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Good rates, Great free breakfast, good location sorta My son and I recently stayed here in early March 03. We got a good rate (49$) a night. Rooms are large, with a kitchen though there were no pots/pans etc. which makes no sense. The free breakfast buffet here is great, with even Belgian waffles! The location was nice due to it being close to the highway. On the other hand, it seems the location is bad, since our rental car's windshield was shot after the first night! Luckily, Hertz didn't charge us! Parking space here is limited, and we had to park out in a field the first night (when the car got shot with a BB). Nice hotel for the price though.", "Date": "Mar 26, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR975743857", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d223039-r11690001-Extended_StayAmerica_Phoenix_E_Chandler_Blvd-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "HotelID": "223039", "Price": "$108"}}
