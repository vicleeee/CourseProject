The personnel is quite friendly and the hotel is well located, not far from the Paseig de Garcia and Diagonal metro station. But the hotel is quite old and needs to be renovated. On the first day the door lock didn't work well and after a few trials by the porter I had to spend the night with the door unlocked. After some maintenance intervention, on the second day I found myself locked inside the room. After the intervention of the porters, I had to change to another room. In this one the bathroom basin was broken and when I open the door of the bathroom the smell was not what one would expect.

The hotel itself is badly in need of updating; the sliding doors had come off our wardrobe and were propped up against the wall for the 3 days we were there. The door next to our room had been kicked in and was hanging off its hinges, as was the door to the toilet downstairs. The staff were surly and disinterested and it took ages to get served at the bar as the barman appeared to also be doing various other jobs.
