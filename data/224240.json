It was a convenient location for our purposes and we felt safe and secure with the locked garage. (All the security warning signs made me question if we should feel safe, but the neighborhood seemed fine.) We stayed in a Deluxe King studio which has a sofa bed in the living area, a large walk-in closet, and a well-equipped kitchenette. It was identical to the rooms we've stayed in at other Hyatt House locations. Some observations: Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. The location of the lone TV made it impossible to be viewed from both the bed and sofa at the same time. If it were installed differently, perhaps it could. I was surprised to find they charge $8/night for self parking as other properties in the area provide it complementary. The breakfast is adequate, but nothing special.

To address the roach comment made by a previous review--I saw nothing of the kind while we were there. The hotel is in an upscale neighborhood with a large shopping mall and many nice restaurants (about 1 mile away) in the vicinity. We were visiting Dallas for medical reasons, and the close proximity to Texas Presbyterian was a huge plus (about 5 miles away). The only downside might be for light sleepers--the hotel is just off of a busy highway, so there is a little traffic noise, but it did not keep us up or wake us up when we were there (we stayed on the top floor and this may have helped). The staff was very kind, efficient, and helpful. I needed some medical records copied and they did so at no charge. The breakfast in the mornings has eggs, meat, fruits, breads--it isn't four-star dining but it is a money and time saver. In the evening there are finger foods, wine and beer at no charge. Two of the evenings we were there, this was our dinner. We stayed at this type of Hyatt so I could have a kitchen to cook gluten free meals; the kitchen was up-to-date and well-equipped. I was very happy to see stainless steel cookware and glass bowls instead of cheap plastic and aluminum. There is a Tom Thumb grocery 1/4 mi away and a Whole Foods by the mall. The bed was very comfortable, there are 2 TVs in the room and a DVD player, as well as a desk. My husband worked in the room during the days when I was gone, and he was very content (not an easy accomplishment). There is a morning shuttle to locations within short drives of the hotel and another in the evening, and this transportation was a godsend to me. The parking garage (gated and 3 covered floors) is attached to the hotel ($8 per day with in and out privileges). Very convenient. There is an outdoor pool/spa (nothing fancy or huge) in the courtyard, small workout room (elliptical, 2 treadmills, free weights, exercise bike), and a business center in the lobby area. I think our room was nicer in person than online photos depict, but it was more basic than the Hyatt Regency. We will be back! (NOTE: the price drops in increments depending on the length of your stay after the 4th night. If you are traveling for medical reasons, mention that as well.)", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cGood experiences in the past - but concerned about recent review\u201d", "Author": "NANCY B", "ReviewID": "UR127313871", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel about twice per year since 2002, when it was the Bradford, and then Summerfield, and I intended to book a room for this June.

Keep in mind that this is Dallas, and the Super Bowl was 2/6/11, in Arlington. I was in town for the NFL Experience, at the Dallas Convention Center, about 7 minutes away from the hotel. It was less than $90 per night. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. I shipped and received many, many packages during my stay, and they were always very gracious about everything. I used the business center every night, to print packing slips, and they were always there to help with paper jams, or extra paper. The room was spacious, with a living room and office area, complete with free high-speed internet (wired or wireless - your choice). There was a kitchenette, complete with microwave, dishwasher, two burners,a full fridge/freezer, and all the dishes, pots, pans, and utensils you could want. No oven, however. The living area has a comfy sectional couch, w/ pullout bed. Also has a flat-screen TV, and a thing that you can connect various audio/video devices to. The office area was just inside the door, and was a desk, lamp, and bulletin board. The bedroom, has a door, and has a very comfy bed, flat-screen tv, and two nightstands. The mirror/sink area is outside the bathroom, and is very well lit. There are drawers and a counter for your stuff. The bathroom is your basic bathroom, with a toilet and a tub/shower. The shower has good water pressure - always a plus. They have free breakfast buffet every morning. Not just fruits and cereal, although those are available. They have sausages, ham, pancakes, muffins, etc. They have an evening social most nights, and that is another buffet, which also includes wine & beer. Some of the evening offerings were: tacos, pizza, fresh cookies, etc. Parking was free, but I think that was just because of the length of our stay. First two floors of parking are covered, 3rd floor not. This mattered, since it snowed while I was there. There is a gym on the 1st floor, with an upright bike, a recumbant bike, 2 treadmills, and an elliptical. Towels and water are provided. Even a scale! There is a small market on the 1st floor, with microwaveable food, ice cream, soft drinks, etc. Grab what you want, take it to the front desk, and charge it to your room. Minor complaints: The elevators are extremely slow. I used the stairs whenever possible. The railings in the staircases are not all securely attached to the walls - be careful! The housekeeping staff did a great job, and added nice touches like: folding a shirt I left out, washing dishes I left in the sink, and making a fan out of a bathroom towel.

Our flight on American arrived from Los Angeles at midnight, so we were tired and anxious to get to bed. I was traveling with my son visiting Southern Methodist University and the tour was at 10AM the next day so we just wanted some sleep. We arrived at the hotel, which is a nice looking brick building up against the freeway and the checked in at the virtually silent hotel. First impressions was that the lobby was nice and clean, possibly recently renovated/new and typical of this hotel type. There are marble floors, some white wainscoting, tan walls, and warm fabrics in the lobby. We drove the car up into their complimentary parking structure on the side and went to our room, by this time at 1:10AM. I was very upset to find the room had a horrendous smell of smoke and I noticed it was the only room on the hall without a no smoking sign. I had specifically asked for a no smoking room and they insisted the hotel was non-smoking, which I though was the case, but I did not know why this room did not have the no smoking sign. I had to walk down the long hallway (it was pretty far to an elevator), get a new key, sign some new forms, and then walk back to move to the room next door, which was fine and had no smell of smoke. The rooms are modern, spacious, and new. We had a guest room style where a modern sofa with a pull out bed is first and then there is a wood cabinet separating it from the area where the bed is. It was a nice room overall. The only downside was the loud noise from the freeway which disturbed my sleep a little. I recommend leaving the fan in the bathroom on to cover up the freeway noise. It was a decent stay, but average. The only things I didn't like was the eggs at the continental breakfast, the loud freeway noise, and first getting a smoking room (avoid room 506, 504 is fine.)", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, well-executed\u201d", "Author": "JJNOLA", "ReviewID": "UR23610681", "Content": "This hotel is very convenient.

After that experience, any property would have been great, but the Bradford turned out to be a most welcome change for the remaining two months we were on this project. The suites we had had the feeling of apartments, and were largely quiet. I had a suite on the interior section, with windows facing the central pool/courtyard area. The suites were exceedingly spacious, with a nice living area, kitchen area, bedroom, and bathroom. Storage space was more than plentiful, which was good for long stays. There were TV's in both the living room and bedroom, though the cable options were a bit limited. There was a very basic VCR in the living room, which was a nice touch, but would be better utilized if it were a DVD player instead. The bed was a tad firm, but otherwise comfortable. Kitchen appliances and tools were ample, and allowed more flexibility for dining in. A nice feature of the suites were that the in-room phones had their own separate numbers with a voicemail inbox that could be set up with a personal greeting. This made it nice for people to contact you, as they did not have to go through the front desk to be transferred to your suite. The pool facilities were nice, though could get busy and noisy if a lot of kids were around. The fitness facility was small, but functional. The laundry facility was more than satisfactory and contained several washers and dryers, so it was near-impossible to ever have a wait to wash clothes. The facility was clean, safe, and secure. Room keycards were needed for access to the parking garage, and to enter the main doors in the overnight hours. The facility is in a safe area, within easy walking distance of a Tom Thumb grocery store, Barnes & Noble, restaurants, and the North Park Mall. It is also within easy driving distance of other area shopping and attractions. The front desk staff was helpful, if unspectacular, in their customer service. I did not have any encounters with the housekeeping staff, though they kept the suites clean and well-stocked. Another nice feature in regards to housekeeping is that the rooms were serviced twice a week, and the guest could \"customize\" the days that they wanted that service to occur. In my last couple of weeks at that property, they were beginning a renovation of some rooms and other parts of the facility. I have since learned that ownership of the property has changed. I hope that the good standards were maintained in this upgrade and change, because for the price and quality, this was a very good long-term stay facility in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northfield, IL", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel; Few Complaints\u201d", "Author": "af847", "ReviewID": "UR14147412", "Content": "This place was recently updated.

The minuses: The wood blinds, while pretty, let in way too much light--- we were all up at the crack of dawn. I certainly wouldn't have been able to nap during the day. I just can't imagine hotels not having block-out curtains in their rooms nowadays. The breakfast buffet wasn't that great--- I've certainly seen better at hotels much cheaper than this. The Nintendo controller was in the bedroom portion of the suite. We had hoped to let our children play in the den area (where the fold-out couch was) while we watched TV in the bedroom. Not possible. And the pool---- it was FREEZING! And this was late September in Dallas! The highs all week had been in the 90s, but you couldn't even let your legs dangle in the water in the afternoon, that's how cold it was. The pool is in the center of the courtyard, blocked on all sides duing the day by the 4-story building, so it only gets direct sunlight for a few hours each day. Our children were extremely disappointed, as hanging out at pool was going to be a big part of our long weekend. I couldn't believe how cold it was. I'm not sure if it's heated at other times of the year, but it would HAVE to be, if it was this cold in September. You might want to check on this if you intend to swim. We wish we had--- this alone would have made a huge difference in our satisfaction with the hotel.
