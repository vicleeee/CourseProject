Unfortunately, it is located right downtown in San Diego where all forms of traffic come together and can be heard all through the night. Planes from nearby San Diego airport roar overhead and the \"normal\" downtown noise from cars can be heard in the room. But the worst are the trains. The hotel is located right on the train tracks running through downtown. Even though we had a room as far away as possible from the tracks it was impossible to get any sleep without ear plugs (my wife used them, but I needed to listen for the kids). The constant (oftentimes several times per minute) arrival of all kinds of trains, trams and locomotives announced by their horns, bells and whistles was accompanied by the fantastic cling-clang of the railroad crossing sign, which is at the corner if the hotel. I am sure a train lover would have enjoyed staying up all night spending time identifying every type of engine and car rattling by. I really didn't, as I was hoping for a night of rest after a week of visiting Southern California amusement parks. The hotel itself is not bad and, as noted, close to downtown and the airport (which was our reason for selecting it).

Once I got the station, they provided what I needed. Upon arrival, she was there and I asked for extra towels(directly). After waiting for an hour I called from the room asking her for the towels. She apologized and told me that she had sent them, but to the wrong room. HUH? One evening I asked for suggestions on things to do in the area. She simply circled a few places on the map and said that it usually is a personal choice on best restaurants. I was a bit taken aback. Since she worked days, I waited for the evening shift to ask the exact same questions. The answers were completely different. Alex was wonderful. I had friends meet me at the hotel and he gave us great ideas on places to eat and enjoy ourselves. The hotel was practical and exactly what I needed on this trip.

Fruit juice, hot tea, hot chocolate and 3 varieties of coffee. Cold cereal and milk- even pitchers of ice water.

The on site parking garage has spaces that are SO narrow, you have to fold in your mirrors to fit your car in the space.

As I'm writing this, a train is passing behind the hotel property maybe 200 ft away. It wouldn't be so bad if it just passed by but the conductor had to pull the horns as he passes by. The horn sound is so powerful that it's like getting slashed by a knife and getting punched below the belt at the same time. No, I'm not exaggerating. The sound is loud and unpredictable and goes on through the wee hours of the night. You have to be sadistic in the most awful way to like staying at this hotel.

There are more positive sides about this hotel than the negative(noise). The location is so great. I didn't want to drive all over SD so we used the MTS trolley to Seaport Village, Gaslamp Quarter, etc. by paying $5 per person, a day pass. This tram goes to Old Town also. It was awesome! There is also Old Town Trolley for about $30 per day where they take you places, more like a tour and narration by the driver than a transportation. This trolley stop is close to the hotel.

I, too, read about the train noise. I did not receive ear plugs on my nightstand nor did I need them. During the week, (I was here for business) the train stops running around 11pm. Before that, it is a bit noisy and takes a little getting used to. I guess if you're a light sleeper you should find another place to stay. The train noise didn't start again until sometime between 4am-5am the following morning. I slept peacefully through the evening and actually got used to the \"train noises\" after the first night. As for the train - it's not like this is the only hotel that is affected by the train. It runs through downtown so most of the hotels in the little Italy area and various hotels thoughout the downtown area will hear the train noise. My friend actually lives several blocks up from the train and can still hear it so I'm not sure how easy it is to escape the noise. As for homeless people wandering into the hotel - that's ridiculous. I felt completely safe throughout my entire stay including walking to and from the hotel through various parts of town. It's a big city - there are always pockets of not-so-nice. The lobby doors are locked throughout the evening and you can only access with a key card. The parking is somewhat limited. I never had a problem, but I was only there during the week. If I would have had a problem - the front desk personnel were extremely helpful and I'm sure would have found alternate parking. There's plenty of street parking that is free after 6pm if you end up having to wait a bit. The front desk people were extremely kind throughout my stay. They helped me look up information about my rental car, provided info on where my guests could park, and gave area restaurant recommendations. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. It's conveniently located next to Little Italy, the Beach, and is even within walking distance to the Gas Lamp Quarter. They even have a pool that faces the ocean so there were some pretty nice sunsets (I even saw someone have pizza ordered to the pool). The rooms were very clean and I didn't have any problems with my stay. People should remember this is a Hampton Inn not the big fancy Hilton in the Gas Lamp Quarter. If you want something big, fancy and expensive go stay somewhere else downtown.

Personally, I did not have any problem with that. Maybe it is because I live in a city and I have learnt to block these background noises.

Becasue this is a debit chard once something is authorized against it you no longer have the ability to spend it. How do you think they thought I was going to eat while I was there ... taking hundreds of dollars more than my stay was going to cost. This should be illegal!!!! I will never stay at a Hampton Inn again and I will advise all I come in contact with to avoid Hampton like the plague. It should also be noted that this hotel lists as one of its pros that it is one block from the trolley ... it is right on the railroad track and trolley track so you have trains blowing horns ALLLLLLL night long. Also, the homeless mission adjoins the hotel on one side so if you decide to take the trolley as your form of transportation you can expect to see many homeless, especially in the morning, and get begged for money while you wait for your ride.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Little Rock, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cBring earplugs!\u201d", "Author": "RxManOnTheRun", "ReviewID": "UR115376582", "Content": "As a frequent traveler and HHonors member, I'm used to Hampton Inns.

The location was great, the breakfast was great and the service was great. The fitness room was nice, usable and cool. There's one night girl that's either little surly or just lacks personality, but other than her, everyone else is wonderful. The trains are horrible. Horrible. We started out in a room on the side that faces the train tracks. Me and my husband are in our very early 30s and thought the trains wouldn't bother us. We thought wrong. We go to sleep fairly late but do like to get up pretty early in the morning. We heard a train at 11:30 that night (though we were still up) and then again the following morning starting before 6 am and continuing, I am not joking, EVERY TEN MINUTES thereafter. All day, the entire day. We promptly asked to be switched to a different room. Luckily, it was a Wednesday and wasn't too crowded so we were graciously accommodated and moved to a 4th floor room overlooking the pool. It smelled somewhat of mold and old cigarettes, but that's nothing compared to the trains. You really have no idea how loud those trains and trolleys can be until you're listening to them every 10 minutes. It's like some sort of mental torture. The guy at the front desk told us we should have booked through Hampton and we would not have had those rooms. He said when people book through other places, like Hotels.com, they put them in those rooms so fair warning. Their shuttle service was great; they even took us to dinner at The Prado at Balboa park for the Thursday night prix fixe special (very highly recommended for anyone. Delicious food, amazing setting. It happens every Thursday night and for $75 per couple you get a bottle of wine, seriously delicious three course meal and two tix to the photographic exhibit next door\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich featured awesome iconic rock 'n' roll photos when we went). For getting around, we used the trolley service behind the hotel (yes, the ones that come by every ten minutes), which was awesome and cheap. We just didn't want to sleep next to them. I would totally recommend this Hampton to someone looking for a great deal and great location, but you MUST make sure you avoid the train track rooms. I thought people were perhaps over-reacting. They were not. For dining, I'd recommend the Prado for romance. The Indigo Grill is right down the street from the Hampton as has some of the most deliciously huge portions I've ever seen. The food is a sort of South American/American fusion and the corn pudding is AMAZING. We also grabbed half price tacos and drinks on Tuesday at the swanky hipster restaurant/bar El Camino, which is in little Italy. We didn't make it to Papalecco's, but heard good things. We ate at Harbor House in Seaport village. Lovely atmosphere, but the worst food we ate in San Diego and, unfortunately, our most expensive meal.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seminole, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed HHonors Customer\u201d", "Author": "petersenby2", "ReviewID": "UR70679137", "Content": "I am a loyal Hhonors Customer who booked this trip using my director's credit card.

It is in a terrific location; the charm and excellent restaurants of Little Italy, the excitement and attractions of the San Diego Bay waterfront, and shopping/dining at Seaport Village are all just steps away from the hotel. This time, however, I had a train noise problem unlike my last two experiences. I was put in room 614 which overlooks the train tracks.

The only other issue I had was I returned to the hotel from a play at the Old Globe Theatre at about 10:30 PM. The hotel had a \"Garage Full\" sign up, but I had already paid for parking during my stay. I had to park out in front of the hotel, inform the desk clerk, and the clerk had to move his own car so that I could park.

Though, the hotel does offer free shuttle to/from the airport. We only used the shuttle service when we headed back to the airport. If you want to use their shuttle, remember to give them 24-hour advance notice. It was extremely convenient to have the Trolley right behind the hotel (fyi: it is the \"County Center/Little Italy\" station stop). We used it everyday. Especially coming home at night, it was a savior knowing that we just had to walk down the block and we were 'home'! It isn't the Trolley that's loud, more like the Amtrak that passes by (I do believe) that makes the most sound when it blows it's horn upon passing. Honestly, with the tv and a/c on in the room and being exhausted, you really end up not caring for the noise. It really isn't a big deal. I mean, you do hear it but it's only temporary for a brief moment. At one point, it was so loud (horn) it startled me, but I gruntled a bit and that was it. It passed. No big deal. ---Room--- Since everyone mentioned about the noise since the railroad and Trolley is right behind, I did try to request for a room opposite of the railroad! I got a room on the inner side of the building on the top floor (6th floor). I must say, what I loved most about the room was the nice soft/comfortable King-size bed and the comforter. I slept comfortably. So this makes up for the negative (i.e. noise) for me. ---Amenities--- What I didn't enjoy so much were the bath amenities. The towels were hard to the touch - really, they should consider using fabric softner! Though, luckily, the bath tissue was soft which was a good thing (Angel Soft brand). The other bathroom amenities I didn't enjoy. Using the shampoo made my hair rough. Bar soap as well. The next day I went and bought my own trial size shampoo and bar soap as a consequence. Again, this is no big deal, minor sacrifice! ---Other--- It was great to wake up in the morning to complimentary breakfast. That fueled me well for the day. Free newspaper on the weekdays.

Having been former residents of San Diego, we were full aware of the location - between busy Pacific Highway and the train tracks that services the SD trolley system, commuter rail and the Amtrak.

But all who plan on staying there should know that the trains are loud, shake the room, run most of the night and regularly honk directly behind the hotel because it is next to a crossing. I am rating this place average not because of the trains but because of the service. First, we waited 40 minutes for the free airport shuttle to retrieve us from the airport despite calling ahead and being assured they would be there just a few minutes after we got our luggage. Knowing the area, we seriously could have walked there quicker. And second, once we arrived at the Hampton Inn, I specifically asked the desk clerk if we were getting a back room (we were checking in late - around 9pm local time and we figured if the hotel was booked we'd probably be in one of the back rooms and right next to the tracks). But instead of saying, \"yeah its late and that's all we have left,\" he said \"no, you are very far away from the train tracks.\" Well, that was a blatant lie because we were in the closest room to the tracks on the 4th floor and had a perfect view of the Beech Street railroad crossing.

The continental breakfast was plentiful and there was free internet service in the hotel.

I've stayed in 3 Hiltons in the past year and the rooms at this Hampton Inn were comparable in every way, just a little smaller. The beds had the \"Cloud Nine\" description which is a great big (clean) fluffy comforter with cover, sheets, fluffy pillows and lap desk. TV in armoire, clock radio, two phones, coffeemaker in the bathroom, the usual, but it was all nice. Hotel cons - got stuck in the elevator on our first day there. The emergency phone calls the front desk and the clerk hung up on us twice because we think she couldn't hear us. Hotel pros - free breakfast! This in itself was worth it! Breakfast was 2 hot dishes (our stay = eggs and sausage), various pastries and bagels to toast on your own, a selection of juices, whole fruit and fruit salad, cold cereal, instant oatmeal, milk, coffee, tea hot chocolate and yougurt. All day long there is coffee and tea service in the dining area as well as whole fruit (oranges, bananas and apples for us). Eat a BIG breakfast, grab some fruit and you can make it through most of a convention and grab dinner later on. The website advertised breakfast to go, but no one said anything to folks talking food up to their rooms or stopping by on the way out. Other Pros - transportation - the hotel again is right on a trolley/train line. The trolley stop is right behind the hotel and there are 2 ticket machines there. Two blocks south is the Santa Fe/American Plaza station which is a transfer point for the trolley as well as the Amtrak and Surfliner local trains - you can walk there easily as well. Across the street is the Holiday Inn and the waterfront. For our stay the Holiday Inn was also a shuttle stop for Comic-Con, but the hotel is an easy 15 minute walk I think. It wasn't that far in my mind at all and I don't walk much, on a map it looked really far but it wasn't. Food - the hotel is right next to a taco stand that's open early and late, and 100 feet away is a Jack in the Box. If you go behind the hotel and up the hill is an area called \"Little Italy\" and the clerk at the hotel told us nothing about it when we asked for a place to eat, but it was wonderful! There are pricey and moderate cafes, restaurants and chains coffee shops, but we ate Filippi's - a great old-style place with wine bottles hanging from the ceiling, employees eating on their breaks right next to the customers and great CHEAP food! Ask for the waitress Irene, she's fun and tell her the bingo girls wrote about her on the internet. The place is full of character and good food. For some the area around the hotel may be iffy, there are those low budget, in my mind \"scary\" hotels a few blocks down - 1 block north is a Courtyard by Marriott, then 2 scary hotels, then what looked like an industrial area. 1 block east, not even a block, was the trolley stop and 2 blocks east was Little Italy. 1 block west was the waterfront, and to the south were the main train station and city center-ish area, so for us it was ok walking around after 11pm, but again there were 100,000 people in town too, lots of taxis, pedi-cabs, etc. so just use common sense. I noticed a room being cleaned had a microwave and mini-fridge, you can probably ask for that at check-in. There is a 7-11 if you go out the front door of the hotel, make a right then make a right. In that neighborhood, alcohol sales stop at 10pm I think. But Filippi's sells 6-packs to go too! You need your hotel key to get into the ice and vending areas on your floor. Parking is $12 a day with in and out privileges and it is added to your bill at the end. You need your key to get into the parking lot - underground, 3 stories and TIGHT if you get in late - and you need your key to get in the elevator from the parking lot. On our last day, we packed up the car, checked out and left our car there until we were done at the convention, caught a trolley back, got our car and left. Not sure if that was Kosher, but it worked for us and saves us parking fees. I'm trying to book my stay for next year's Comic-Con again now! Oh, if you book through the convention, they do use this hotel at about the same rate we paid but with a harsher cancellation policy, 72 hours I think, and with our booking directly through the hotel it was 48 hours and no credit card deposit - I'm a HiltonHonors member though so don't know if that helped. Oh and free daily paper, or almost daily, frree wi-fi in the lobby, free internet in the rooms, and they have a shuttle too! Ok, and this may sound funny, but I think they steam or poach their eggs in a microwave, so they look really bright yellow and white, someone said like Play-Doh food, LOL, but they tasted fine!", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cTrains too much!\u201d", "Author": "attytravel", "ReviewID": "UR17920270", "Content": "I found this property to have the typically nice quality and service I expect from a Hampton Inn.

You will not find a better central location for seeing the sites in and around San Diego. The hotel is located approx. 3 miles from the airport, one street over from the water front. Compared to the hotels within a two mile area the Hampton offered the best prices by far. The hotel itself is spartan but functional. The rooms were standard hotel size and clean. The beds were extremely comfortable and the bathroom was well stocked and clean. Housekeeping was prompt and thorough. One of the things I liked is that you could open the windows and take advantage of the breeze off the water. The morning breakfast was average but provided the protien to start the day and get you to lunch. As stated in previous reviews there is ample parking but it is tight. With a little manuevering you should have no problem. Check in took about 5 minutes and check out was automatic. The hotel provides a computer with printer (no charge) to print your airline boarding passes. You can also use it to check the internet for information on any sights you might plan on seeing. Across the street is the Embarcadaro (sp) which is the city's tourist waterfront. You are within two blocks of the Maritime Museum, six blocks of the Midway Museum (fantastic tour) and about ten blocks from Seaport Village's quaint shops. They have a Crazy Shirt shop and several restaurants. For dinner one only has to walk out the front door, turn right and head two blocks up the street to Little Italy. There you will find approx. two blocks of very nice restaurants. Be sure to eat at Phillipes Pizza Grotto. they have one of the few parking lots but get there early. We arrived at 4 PM and when we left about an hour later there were approx. 20 people waiting to get in. Price's are local and not touristy. And this was on a Tuesday afternoon. Heading back to the hotel you will pass a 7-11 where you can buy your Cheetos for an evening snack. If you like Mexican there is a locals taco stand next door. If you don't choose to sitesee by rental car the City Trolley is directly behind the hotel. This is one of the best kept tourist secrets and takes you almost anywhere you may want to go. The Trolley runs all the way from Old town and the Fashion Mall to the Gaslight area. You may want to try the Commercial Tourist Trolley also as it goes to all the tourist attractions including Coronado. All in all we found the Hampton Inn to be the ideal location for seeing San Diego and saving a few bucks. Now the bad, the trains. Yes they are loud. Thank goodness I'm a train lover or I might have been upset over our location in the hotel. We were on the interior courtyard which acted just like an amphitheatre. With the windows closed they were a noticable nucense. With the window open they were LOUD. A pair of earplugs would do the trick, which I had, or you could come back later in the evening as they seemed to stop about 9 PM. I would suggest asking for a room on the outside or at the front of the hotel. Anyway, we kept remarking about what a great location we had every time we returned to the hotel.

The staff is excellent. Their shuttle service is VERY accommodating and the breakfast buffet is \"yummie\".

More Good: Location is very close to the USS Midway museum, the Maritime museum, harbor cruises, cruise terminal, Amtrak station, rail rapid transit station. The bad: Very close to railroad tracks. Due to numerous grade crossings, trains must blow whistles often.

I was in a room on the second floor close to the tracks; the noise is likley to be less noticable higher up on the opposite side of the hotel. I was there on weekday; weekends likely have less trains due to no commuter trains. Better soundproofing is needed.

We had two rooms, one facing the back and the train lines and the other on the side facing down town. I heard the first trains and tried to move rooms but no others were available that night. My Wife usually sleeps through most noise but this room was the exception. Neither of us slept all night - what a racket these trains make - hooting and tooting all night long - and during the day. Our Daughters stayed in the other room and were also wakened but not as much. We moved next day into a side facing room which was a bit quieter but we still never got a full sleep. It's a real shame because in every other way this hotel is great. It has an integral car park, a swimming pool facing the sea / naval base, fantastic complimentary breakfast and is within walking distance of down town. You can take the trams but at $2 a ride why bother - the exercise does you good. Perhaps double glazing is needed to cut out the noise or the toiletries should include earplugs but that would be unsafe - you might not hear the fire alarm.
