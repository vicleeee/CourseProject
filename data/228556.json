We were not disappointed. The hotel is in a good location - a 10 minute brisk walk to Plaza Catalunya which is at the top of the Rambla. The room was a good size with a huge bed! All very clean and well presented. You do have to pay to use the safety deposit box but it is only 4 euros per day and they didn't charge us for the final day as we left at 11 am. There is a TV in the room but it does not have any English channels apart from a music channel. The Internet is free to use although it was a but intermittent. However, it was useful to have as we had phones and an iPad with us which we were able to use. There is also a balcony in some rooms, it was a very small one but nice to have and it was good to watch the goings on outside. We did not have the breakfast in the hotel as this was not part of our package but it was not too badly priced - 8 euros each per day.

We stayed in a superior room on the top floor. These are the renovated rooms and all of them have a large balcony with table and 2 chairs. The room is big by European standards. It had ample room around both sides of the bed and about 4ft of space between the end of the bed end the wall on which the desk was located. The bathroom is a good size and renovated with tile walls and floor. The shower had a rain-head and a hand held. The wireless internet worked great and was free (just ask reception for the log in and password). The bed was very hard, the towels are your basic hotel thin towels, and they do not have facial tissue/kleenex in the bathroom. We had considered staying at the Cram, Axel and SOHO hotels. All 3 of those hotels seem nicer and much more modern based on the images and hotel websites. The reason we did not choose those hotels were based on reviews here, size of the rooms, and the cost for a balcony. The rooms at those hotels looked tiny, reviews show the internet unreliable, and if you wanted a room with a balcony you had to pay much more. The Caledonian provided a nice sized room with a big balcony terrace and good internet. The trade-off was that we had a hard bed, basic level accommodations, and no pool (we went to the beach instead). Basically we went with the best room in the lower class hotel instead of the basic room in the higher class hotel. The choice worked well for us. It is located about 1.5 blocks from Universitaat Metro station.

In Barcelona there is so many options to choose between cafeterias etc, so no problem to go without B&B. One funny thing - during reservation I added only one comment - pls do not give me the room next to elevator. And guess, where was my first room ? Elevator basically went thru it:) Luckily they were able to give me other room - this was ok, even though facing street, windows were soundproof. The only problem was - metro. This is common problem in many hotels in Barcelona - you can hear (and feel) every single metro train pass under the building.

My only gripe was the noisy gurgling water pipes - it could have been from the air conditioning - but they gurgled non stop all night. My advice would be to ask to swap rooms if you encounter the same problem. Also the bed was a little hard for my liking.

There's even a Starbucks a few minutes towards Las Ramblas and on the same street..if your into that. Note: they do and don't take Amex! This was a business trip and so I have to use the Amex BUT they insisted that I could not use the AMEX for pre-authorisation.

I arrived at the hotel on Wednesday at around 1:30PM, I was quite tired as I had been traveling for 16 hours before arriving at Barcelona. Anyways, I was told my room wasn't ready yet and to come back at 2PM (although it says check in time is 1pm) So I went to an Internet Cafe across the street to stall for time until my room was read. When I came back I was given room 101 on the first floor... It was a single bedroom which looked to me as probably the smallest room in the entire hotel. It was spotlessly clean to be fair and everything looked tidy, but the size of the room was so tiny that I couldn't even do push-ups if I wanted to. The bathroom was great, very clean with soap, towels, and a hair-dryer available. My room had a mini-bar with all the usual drinks, and also a TV with only 1 English Channel (CNN). In total their was maybe 7 channels but in other languages. Anyways, In terms of tidiness and hygiene the hotel was excellent, the only thing that bothered me was being cramped in a tiny room. The hotel staff were somewhat friendly, but very formal. The most friendly was the gorgeous lady at the breakfast room on weekdays. She was a real charm, very polite, friendly, helpful and even thought me a few things in Spanish. The breakfast was the best thing at the hotel, a wide variety of excellent food. Hot eggs, sausage, and bacon. Fruit Salad, Tea, Coffee, Fresh Bakery, Cereal and much more. The hotel location wasn't that bad either, it's about a 10 minute walk to Plaza Catalunya. To summarize my thought about the hotel, don't expect anything fancy like a Sauna, Gym, or a pool. It's a great place if you just need a place to sleep after a long day, but nothing luxurious or special. It was closer to a 2-star than a 3-star, and a bit over-priced considering the amenities and services offered. I'm not saying the place was horrible, or not a good hotel.

When you were coming back from nightlcubs in the early hours of the morning the blackout curtains made you think it was late at night.

Despite leaving the do not disturb sign on - the maids would knock on your door and if you were not up by 12.00 the phone would ring and ask if you wanted your room cleaned. V annoying.

The hotel is in a very convenient location - within walking distance to Las Ramblas, Barrier Gothic among other areas. The metro is also very close by. The hotel in terms of amenities, staff assistance, room size, etc. was average at best. Our air conditioning did not work the entire time we were there (we did have staff attempt to fix the problem but it was never resolved) and there was an odor in the bathroom. With that being said, it was an inexpensive hotel. We don't spend too much time in hotel rooms so the issues were tolerable while we were there.

We booked in from the Friday to the Monday and were the last of our group to arrive. When booking we did ask for a large room. Our room was a small double at the rear of the hotel overlooking lots of rundown apartments. The bath was miniscule and I'm only 5'3\"! More akin to a hip bath really. Room was cramped, lots of hanging space and open shelves but only one small drawer. Extra blankets are in the wardrobe but no extra pillows. Had to ask at reception and we were given 'the last 2' Reception had no spare key cards which was a blow as my hubbie and I often like to do different things and it meant we didn't have the freedom to come and go as we pleased. Their excuse was that they were full. Surely it is not impossible to hold a few extra key cards for programming? TV had only CNN as English language station. My brother and sister were each allocated a room on the top floor which were much larger and had balconies - these are the rooms for people with mobility difficulties. What happens when there is a fire alarm I dread to think! The location is excellent. Breakfast is 13 euros so we went next door to a terrific cafe and had spanish breakfast (tortilla, tomato bread, a glass of rioja[!] and a cafe con leche) fo less than 6 euros. The cafe also had freshly squeezed orange juice made to order. Yum. Barcelona is a terrific city to visit and we will definately go again but we will look for somewhere better than the Caledonian.", "Date": "July 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "lisburn NI", "Title": "\u201cexactly on the button\u201d", "Author": "me_always_away", "ReviewID": "UR7871957", "Content": "just a short one this time....went to Barcelona on June 8 and stayed in the Caledonian.

I contacted the hotel directly via email to request availability and the prices. Was waiting foran answer 8 days and then had to send another email again to remind them about my request. The answer arrived back from them 12 days later on. They did answer that they are fully booked and do not have possibility to accommodate us. After that we went to internet search to find another hotel. The search results also brought up the Caledonian hotel who actually did have availability. It seems to me that this hotel booking/ reservation policy is to sort out their guests. I only wonder why our family was not good enough for them to stay there. I dont agree with this kind of behaviour and truly feel that this hotel has big working issues. Also reading previous reviews here on tripadvisor, I have to admit that in the end I am happy that we did not book with them. I would like to let the hotel management to know that they need to take better care of their costumer service ethics.", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ile de France", "Title": "\u201cGood location, not outstanding but fine\u201d", "Author": "terabytes", "ReviewID": "UR7374497", "Content": "Caledonian hotel is a \"simple\" 2-3* hotel, with no major flaws. Rooms are clean and OK. There are not many facilities besides the rooms (small restaurant and bar). Breakfast is average: OK but \"minimum\" in terms of choice (even if no important item is missing) and service (the waitress is here only to ask your room #). A tip: include the breakfast in your hotel room reservation (50% reduction). The hotel's location is very convenient, just one block away from \"plaza de la universitad\" (subway station) and a few minutes away from \"plaza de catalunia\" and La Rambla. Two mini-marts, opened late at night, are just around the corner. Many buses lines also stop near the hotel, including the \"aerobus\" line coming from the airport, which stops at \"plaza de la universitat\". However, in the other way around, the aerobus does not pick up passengers at this stop and you have to go to plaza de catalunya to get on. One plus is the free Wifi connexion, which - surprisingly - isn't advertised anywhere in the hotel (you have to look at the hotel's web site to know it).
