Luckily, next door you will find the Park Hotel. Upon setting foot in the hotel lobby, you will be impressed by the lovely warm decor and the aroma of \"Under a Fig Tree\". By the time you get to the reception you are anticipating if your room will differ from the pictures you have seen through the lens of another's camera. However, in my case, I was given a vacant expression and the news that my booking had failed to appear on the system. Great. Once I had controlled my rage and could construct a coherent sentence in my already confusing Scottish tongue, I asked what could be done. From here, the Park Hotel had arranged a room with breakfast in another hotel and would provide transport to get there (despite being a stone's throw away). They had asked us to come back tomorrow and they would guarantee an upgraded room. The hotel we were placed in was the NH Amsterdam, which was reasonable but we did witness a rat scuttle across the floor with a piece of toast someone had dropped during breakfast. So, the next day upon returning to the Park Hotel, I was pleased to be back. The hotel staff had upgraded our room to a Junior Suite. After some thorough apologies, I made my way up stairs and was instantly impressed by the hotel's standard of apology as the suite was a considerable upgrade from my initial booking and expectation. The suite has a large lounge area which had enough room to cater to all the mess we would make while staying in the hotel and was also nicely covered with nice dark warm colours. The bathroom was nicely decorated with a large Audrey Hepburn Ikea picture watching over the toilet. The shower was spectacular, the rain shower head produces so much power and water that I thought the cubicle may fill before the water can drain. The hotel provides an exceptionally comfortable bed with high thread count sheets and duvet's and I am honestly still missing the warmth. In terms of location, the hotel it situated just outside the center but it is for this reason, the area is not as run down and dusty looking. The hotel has trams, taxi's, buses and canal bus's all within two minutes walking distance, which will take you right to Dam Square if required. Given that the hotel is within the Museumplein, it is obvious but it is very easy to get to the Rijkmuseum and the Van Gogh museum, as well as others. The hotel also has a number of small restaurants within a half mile radius where you will find good food without the hustle and bustle of the center and also at a more reasonable price. However, the Momo restaurant, which is attached to the hotel is a good choice, with nice meals. All together, I stayed in Amsterdam for three days and found the hotel to be amongst the best I have stayed in which includes long list from Los Angeles to Shanghai. I would recommend this hotel to anyone making the trip to Amsterdam. Also, today I received an apology in letter from the hotel regarding the initial booking problem. This was a kind and an act which didn't have to be carried out but displays the thought and quality of the hotel and people that work within it's walls.

The staff checked us in but unfortunately no one showed us to the room, we were just given directions to get there. Our baggage was also just left for us to take ourselves. Our room was on the 5th floor which meant that we had to get the lift to the 4th floor and then go up 2 flights of stairs with our luggage. The room was spacious, but I was expecting a much bigger room. The gym was available for all visitors but we did not use this. We drank at the Momo bar/restaurant next door which was very convenient. The shower was the best, a huge shower head, but be warned none of the toiler or shower doors locked. All trams went past the hotel so getting into dam square was very easy. The location itself was pretty good. Staff pretty much helped us find where most touristy things were, which was a big help.

I chose the hotel because of the central location. I was not disappointed on that. The restaurant adjacent to the hotel is a very hype restaurant and brings in a crowd of trendy people. It's a nice feeling of being in a good place. Room was very clean. Staff at the reception desk and luggage were very nice and helpful. The breakfast is lovely and varied.However, for the full week I stayed there, only 1 lift was working. The other one was not being repaired ! Being on the 7th floor, I did a lot of waiting at the lift during my stay. Did not appreciate that. I also had a bad experience with room service. I've ordered a full meal on night = pasta and fruit salad with ice cream. I was told that the wait would be 20mn. Being busy working, it's after an 1hour that I realized that the food was still not delivered. I called room service again to let them know. And I was told that they came around but nobody was in the room. This is not the answer I was expecting...! I've asked them to come around again and make sure that the food is hot. The food was not hot, even the ice cream for the dessert had completely melted but they didn't bother to replace it. I do understand that this can happen but it's the way it is dealt with that shows the quality of the service in a hotel. I complain when checking out and I didn't have to pay for the meal.

Shower and toilet were modern, small but not a problem. TV has about 4 English channels, some German, Italian and Dutch. Plenty of storage space. Mini-bar is WAY overpriced though (8 euro for a small can of Heineken!), we didn't use it.

The first level had a small seating area, a wet bar, a desk, a powder room/water closet, and a door that opened up to the outside. There was no real balcony that you could step out on to, but I did open the door to the outside and read a bit overlooking the street and canal.

I travel to Amsterdam frequently for work and, unfortunately, this hotel is the preferred hotel closest to my office. I'd like to start on a positive note. The first impression of the hotel when you arrive into the lobby is good. It's modern, elegant and leads you to believe this is going to be quite a slick operation. It doesn't take long for the cracks to appear. The staff on reception are polite but don't seem genuinely interested in making you feel welcome. Every time I arrive I'm asked if it's my first time at the hotel, I tell them that in fact I've been there several times. Nevertheless, every time I have to fill out a customer information card. Any half decent hotel saves your customer details to save you the hassle and time of filling out yet another guest card. When I last arrived I was informed that I was in a room on the 4th floor but that the lift was broken. It was late at night and they didn't even offer to help with my bags. So I was left to walk up the four flights to reach my room. I opened the door and it was ice cold inside. Not because of overactive air-conditioning (which they have) but because they had thoughtfully left the window wide open and it was about 7 degrees outside. The rooms itself was ok otherwise. Don't take OK to mean good. It looks relatively stylish but everything is quite cheaply done from the bathroom fittings that are loose on the wall to the sockets that are so thoughtlessly placed that you can't fit a power adaptor into them. So you might struggle to charge your computer, I also found I struggled to get online as the cable network didn't work. Thankfully the overpriced Wifi was available. On the plus side, the bedsheets are nice and the bed is comfortable (if you like them very soft). I did end up with some insect bites which I can't positively attribute to bed bugs but all I'll say is my colleague staying at the hotel had the same (!) So back to the lift. Four days and it was still not working. Beware the basic rooms, they are tiny. So tiny in fact that the bathroom is in the room just separated by a curtain. The breakfast is OK, nothing special. And they have the tiniest cereal bowls I've ever seen. If you like a decent bowl, you'll be making several trips back to the buffet. On my last checkout, they asked me if my stay was nice.

I'm frequent flyer with Lufthansa and KLM, frequent traveller with Deutsche Bahn and drive with a chaffeur about 12,000 km per month. I booked this hotel because I supplier wanted to meet me there. He had been there some years before and had spend a lot of money for a distributor meeting. So I thought, it can't be that bad, although I was astonished that the price was just 130 EUR per night. When I saw the room I was shocked. The room was stinking and had a very humid air. Obviously the carpet had been under water and was still wet. I went to the reception and asked for another room without carpet - because I had seen in the internet that they have rooms without carpet. The offered me a room without carpet for an upgrade price of 80 EUR per night. After some negotiations I took it for 60 EUR more per night. Then I tried to eat something in the restaurant. It was 10.55 pm and they told me at the front desk the restaurant would be open until 11 pm but the restaurant didn't want to serve me food anymore as it was closed since 10.30 pm. The next day we tried to have lunch at the restaurant at 2.15 pm. The reception told us again that the restaurant would be open but the restaurant refused to serve us food - because they were closed. So we had food in the lobby and went to my room to work - until we saw ants on the floor walking between the small carpet underneath the living room table and a flower. We called the reception and three people came to my room and offered to spray poison in my room. I heavily refused because I didn't want to have poison in my room but they told me it's biological. Also some mushrooms are biological but can be nonetheless lethal. What a stupid idea. I told the three people that I'm not willing to pay an upgrade price of 60 EUR per night, because they had in first step given me a room with wet floor and mould fungus in the air and on top now having the ants in the room. He said he would consider it. We left the room to have dinner and when I came back I found a box of cookies for about 3 EUR in my room. The service was bad, the people were not helpful, the stairs in my room to the upper level were with carpet and the carpet was dirty, overall just a horrible place. On top they charge 19,90 EUR for going online per day plus 24 EUR for breakfast, even if you just want to have just a muffin and a cup of coffee. And the parking btw costs 49 EUR per night. So if you come by car, want to stay in a room without mould fungus, want to have breakfast and wifi, you have to add almost 100 EUR to your room rate and that doesn't include any meals in the restaurant where they most of the time don't want to serve you.

Great location, in the Museum Quarter, you can walk everywhere.

Rooms: Good comfortable beds (and warm duvet covers!), spacious enough bathrooms with underfloor heating. Beware, not all rooms in this hotel are the same. Some bathrooms are open plan - which is not for everyone. The only negative is that there is no double-glazing, therefore the room feels a bit cold (in October) and you can hear the noise from the street. Lobby: the lobby area - or \"Living room\" as they call it - is very nice, with books, magazines and newspapers available for everyone to browse, nice music and in general a good atmosphere. Check in was fast, and everyone in reception was very professional and helpful. Restaurant: Momo is a very popular restaurant, so do book if you want to have dinner there, because tables get booked up fast. The bar is quite busy too. The very annoying drawback at this hotel is that internet is not free - there is a charge or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19.50 for 24 hrs!

We booked through hotels.com and pictures there looked good. I did notice that the room we booked did not have a picture, and now I know why: the room is rediculously small, has a shower closet, and a toilet, but no real bathroom. Apparently this is what they call an \"open bathroom.\" The room is barely big enough for one person to walk round, and there is no room for suitcases. We asked for an upgrade because we felt deceived by the high price and very small accomodations of which pictures were deliberately omitted...........the only pictures they showed was of their other rooms, so it felt like a bait and switch! Since we thought we had splurged on this expensive hotel room, it was very disappointing and not at all what we had expected. They were only willing to upgrade us for an additional 40 euros, which after a lot of arguing they lowered to $25. We did not receive a free upgrade as one of the other reviewers said they received ( I wish I had checked tripadviser before booking). I told them no thank you, as I wasn't going to spend any more money on this hotel and the staff wasn't even friendly. I asked for a refund to cancel the room, but the room was pre-paid and they couldn't give us any. Another thing that shocked us was that the hotel manager was on vacation even during the busy IBC convention that week in Amsterdam! Then the front desk told us of a bus service to Schiphol (bus #197)around the corner from the hotel, only to find out that the entire month of September this bus service had been discontinued due to construction. I was fortunate to be able to read this in Dutch or we would waited for nothing and missed our flight entirely. When we ran back to the hotel we were told that their airport shuttle needed a 2 hour advance reservation, so we were forced to take a taxi instead to make a mad dash to the airport. Their wrong information caused us a lot of stress, and you'd expect hotel staff to be properly informed of a month-long cancellation of the schiphol bus service.

My 'Poor' rating is based on the following incidents: - We arrived at 10am on the first day and enquired about early check-in. The receptionist said no without any investigation. Fine - we were early, so we could see pass this. But as it was pouring outside, we asked if we could borrow an umbrella, to which her response was 'we have no more - you'll have to buy one'. We subsequently asked concierge the same question as we dropped off our bags, and miraculously one appeared. So first gripe is this particular receptionist clearly did not care for us much at all. - When we eventually returned to check-in, we were assigned a room in the older quarters of the hotel. The room was refurbished but had a god awful sewage stench. I had my suspicions when I noticed the room was to the very end of the corridor and so it proved. We called reception and requested to switch rooms. - Our second room was up on the fifth floor - again in the older quarters. To reach this room you have to take the lift to the fourth floor and walk up another flight of stairs. Interesting. Again, room was reasonably refurbished and thankfully no smell. The problem with this room was the practicality of the layout - as one reviewer has previously pointed out. The shower and toilet cubicle doors get in the way of each other and it is impossible to step out of either without having to play some sort of physical exercise game. Apart from this awful design, everything else was decent. - We received a letter the following day to apologise - again, as highlighted in a previous review, these letters seem quite common and impersonal.

We can't speak highly enough of Joost, we were watching him potter about in the reception area and it was clear that this was a man who only cared about the experience of the guests whilst in the hotel, fully prepared to get stuck in and sort out things that were outside of his remit.

The facilities, i.e. the gym, are outstanding, the food in the restaurant, MOMO, is exceptional as are the cocktails in the bar, even though it takes an age to get served, but this is because the bar is evidently very popular with the local 'beautiful' people!", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo", "Title": "\u201cgreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "yehiaCairo", "ReviewID": "UR116060938", "Content": "great hotel, amazing location, staff and room, recommended", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "wales", "Title": "\u201cTRUE REVIEW OF THE PARK HOTEL AMSTERDAM\u201d", "Author": "ccfceuropesNO1", "ReviewID": "UR115883964", "Content": "Just back from a 4 day trip at the Park Hotel. The hotel is everything you could want from a 4star hotel. Its very clean and modern and in a great location for all of Amsterdams attractions,especially shopping,bars and resturants. We stayed in what seemed like the \"older\" side of the hotel.This side has no double glazing and overlooking a very busy main road can be very noisy at times. Directly oppersite the hotel are some lovely bars/resturants including an Irish Bar and Hard Rock Cafe,these were lovely to sit outside and watch the world go by. Although we never ate in the hotel the new modern bar and resturant always looked quite busy with regulars and guests. One small gripe we did have was that the shuttle service to the airport which was offered by the hotel was GREATLY over priced.We took the tram to central station and caught the direct train service to the airport,total journey time was approx 30mins and saved ourselves quite a bit of money!!!

They have a 'living room' around the foyer in which snacks & drinks are served which is pretty good. However, if staying here (or for that matter anywhere in Amsterdam) a visit to Momo, the hotel restaurant is an absolute must. Yes, it is expensive, but you certainly get what you pay for here. Try the beautiful lobster & mango sushi roll or the perfectly cooked teriyaki fillet steak.

It seemed quite busy but we got straight to the desk very quickly. The young lady seemed very busy but quickly asked how our flight was and efficiently checked us in. It wasn't the warmest greeting we have had on our Europe trip but I'll put it down to how busy they were at that particular moment. We got quite a nice room on the top floor which over looked some of the surrounding buildings, not the canal which was ok as I didn't pay for or request a canal view. The room itself was very nice with bar a very comfy queen sized bed, LCD TV which got quite a few English speaking channels, safe and bar fridge. The room and bathroom were both very nice. You are able to get both wired and wireless internet in your room. For a price. For a ridiculously expensive price. It was around 24 euro for 24 hours! What the! It's 2011 and it is just unacceptable for this sort of extortion. One word of warning when leaving the Park Hotel. Watch the steps when leaving the hotel. There are only three steps, but when we left to get breakfast in town prior to checking out I used the little steps instead of taking the ramp which we would normally do. There had been some rain the night before and as I went to stand on the middle of the three steps, which I hadn't noticed was very small, my foot slipped out from under me and I was able to just put my hand down under me before my butt collided with the steps. Unfortunately my hand got a lot of skin torn from it by the steps. Luckily I am fairly fit person and was able to save myself from getting seriously hurt, as a simple slip and fall onto concrete can cause serious damage. The doorman saw what had happened and showed a lot of concern for my welfare. He told that this is a very common occurrence and has seen someone very seriously hurt on those very steps. He insisted I let them know at the reception desk and I said I would when I checked out. So, when checking out I let the young lady know of my little mishap, as I didn't really consider it a big deal, but thought it really needed to be highlighted before someone was seriously hurt on them. The young lady at the reception desk didn't seem that concerned when I told her my story, showed her my hand and told her what the doorman had told me. Eventually she gave a half hearted sorry and finished checking me out.. I bumped into the doorman on the way out and he asked how I was. I filled him in on the lack of interest and concern during check out and he told me to email the management later on. So big thumbs up to the doorman and a thumbs down to the check out personnel.

It's modern and quite funky, but it is looking a little worn around the edges in places. Hotel rooms are notoriously small in Amsterdam and this hotel is no exception, so we upgraded to a junior suite, just to get a little more space and a bathroom that you could actually swing a cat in. The upgrade was 80 Euro a night - quite pricey for a couple of square metres of extra floor space, but we felt it was worth it not to feel like we were sleeping in a cupboard for 3 nights! Breakfast is apparently 'the most extravagant in Amsterdam' (or something like that according to the hotel advertising posters) - well it was fine for a buffet, very nice actually, but we've had far better in other 4 star hotels, so we're not really sure why they think their breakfast is so special?! Service was very average all round - not much of a smile from any of the reception staff and pretty poor at breakfast time (apart from the lady who signed us in each morning for breakfast - who was lovely and friendly): we observed other guests (thankfully not us) encountering long waits and considerable difficulties when ordering fried eggs instead of the scrambled eggs already cooked and available on the buffet - at one point one morning it took three waiting staff to work out between them how to fry eggs 'sunny side up' and get them to the correct guest who had ordered them 30 minutes previously!! Understandably this particular guest was not amused. There was no fresh (or even UHT) milk in the room for our tea - we kept having to ask for some to take up to our room. And the maximum number of English breakfast tea bags we were given at any one time was two - annoying if we wanted a cup of tea in the evening and then one in the morning when we woke up. Would it really hurt to give guests an ample supply of tea bags each day??! If you stay at this hotel be prepared for traffic noise - the hotel is in a great location for all the sights but it is on a very busy road and our windows were only single glazed (with rather a draught whistling through them in places - thank goodness it wasn't winter!). It didn't bother us too much, but if you want peace and quiet you should definitely choose another hotel. One thing that particularly bugged us was the 20 Euro daily charge for the use of the internet. Having upgraded to a junior suite, we really weren't prepared to pay another 20 Euros each day to use the internet. Totally and utterly scandalous inour opinion. When my husband expressed his discontent about this to a member of the reception staff, he was told - \" All four and five star hotels in Amsterdam charge for use of the internet so we are only doing what everyone else does\". What crazy logic! Our advice to The Park Hotel management team is . . . DARE TO BE DIFFERENT! You never know, it might just make you stand out from the crowd, get you a few more customers and increase your positive ratings on TripAdvisor! You could certainly do with them. Upon checking out, we were asked - \"Has everything been to your satisfaction during your stay ?\" We told the (very miserable) girl that it had all been ok but that there were a few things that we were a little disappointed with (one being that the phone in our room wasn't working - which meant we couldn't contact reception from our room and had to walk downstairs each time we wanted to speak to someone - we told them the phone wasn't working but no one bothered to fix it!). The girl on reception just nodded - she didn't ask us what could've been better about our stay and just gave us our bill. It's such a shame when customer service is poor like this - it really leaves a bitter taste and is so easily remedied and unnecessary. Some people just take no pride in their work.

The toilet cubicle also smelt badly of stale urine and clearly was not cleaned properly, and the overall structure was so small that when standing up from a sitting position one almost inevitably banged one's head on the wall. The shower had two sprayheads, one fixed, and once we worked out how to use it it was not bad, good water pressure and temperature. However, there was nowhere to easily dry towels eg if two of you had a shower in the same morning. The bed was comfortable although the duvet was rather too warm (and this was in March!) but again, the designer had not thought hard enough about the lighting which was appalling. Each side of the bed had its own little bendy LED light which meant that instead of throwing out light, it was directed (eg onto your book) and gave the impression of reading by torchlight. There was a spotlight at the top of the wall to one side of the bed which was angled so as to blind you when you turned it on if you were still in bed, and the lighting for the bathroom mirror was useless (including the illuminated shaving mirror which did not illuminate). We had a room looking out over the main road (the Stadhouderskade) and the tram bells were a bit noisy, plus the people who decided to honk their car horns at 4.30am were annoying, but overall the noise wasn't too bad. The windows were also a bit drafty but again, not really a problem for us. Plus points in the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a real hairdryer, and the curtains blacked out fully. There were tea/coffee facilities (kettle, cups etc) in the wardrobe but we did not use these, nor the minibar in the fridge. Plenty of wooden coathangers but not a great deal of storage space for clothes if you are staying more than a few days. Like others we only had breakfast in Momo but it did look very busy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are, however, hundreds of good places to eat near the hotel of an evening. The location is good, far enough away from the city centre for peace and quiet but near to museums, shops, and so on \u00e2\u20ac\u201c let's face it, you can walk pretty much anywhere in Amsterdam! We caught the 197 bus from the airport to very near the Rijksmuseum and the Park Hotel is just a short walk. The staff were helpful and the hotel itself is very stylish, with a lovely \u00e2\u20ac\u0153living room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area in the lobby with designer seating, loads of books to read and beautiful art and sculptures to enjoy.

After booking I was slightly worried as so many of the reviewers seemed to be reporting slight niggles with the room which spoiled their stay and as this trip was to celebrate a milestone birthday I wanted everything to be as perfect as possible. The bathrooms especially sounded less than ideal. I needn't have worried as the executive rooms we had booked had a 'proper' en-suite bathroom as opposed to the leaking walk-in showers in other rooms. The raindance shower was absolutely gorgeous. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and clean. Ours was on the 7th floor with a view down over the canal and the rooftops of Amsterdam. There were no problems with noise. My only criticisms would be that the room was very dark - the lighting seemed inadequate and there were no bedside lights. It was also freezing cold the week we were in Amsterdam and it was difficult to maintain the room temperature - sometimes too cold, sometimes way too hot. The staff we encountered were capable and friendly. However, even though we arrived way after check-in time had started, it did about 15 minutes to assign rooms to us, but I think a full hotel the night before had held things up slightly. The hotel is smart and stylish with a gorgeous lobby area where you can sit and drink cocktails from the bar, sink into comfortable chairs and flick through the endless shelves of coffee table books. A lovely way to end a busy day walking around. The location of the hotel is excellent - close to the museums (my main reason for choosing this hotel).

This, mostly a clean and comfortable place, is run by a friendly and competent staff. Our room was on the first floor and facing the busy Stadhouderskade, but we did not notice much noise at night at all. We had a disappointing view of The Hard Rock Cafe directly across the canal from the hotel, yet we weren't in Amsterdam to hang out in the hotel room so that did not bother us much. Our room was on the small side, but well laid out and with decent storage areas. The location is nearly perfect, most of the city centre's attractions are within a reasonable walk. We had a few problems with temperature control in the room. Basically, it was either too cold or too warm, no matter how much we fiddled with the heat controls. Also our beds were much too soft and bouncy, with thin, foamy pillow-tops which had the tendency to slide off the beds during the night. We were only given one pillow per bed, but two more pillows were sent when we asked. The breakfast was abundant and good. We wished that they had it going until 11, not 10, but we managed fine. We loved sitting by the street level windows every morning and watching Amsterdamers and tourists whizzing by on their bikes. Momo, the pan-Asian restaurant at the hotel, had lots of delicious choices for a memorable, albeit pricey dinner. Unfortunately, room service seems like an afterthought at The Park. There're only a few, very basic choices like hamburgers, steak and club sandwiches. (Why not offer selections from Momo also?) Our room service dinner was delivered by two people on two hand trays; they did not bring a cart, so it was a little awkward to scramble for some space for them to place the trays. The bottle of white wine we ordered came luke-warm in an un-chilled metal cooler; we couldn't drink it until it was cooled in the mini-bar fridge. The cleaning staff the next day did not know how to handle the glasses and cups left over from the room-service dinner, so they just left them as they were. The mini-bar is decent, but lacked a few basic mixers while offering too much Coke and Sprite. And the mini-bar was not refilled one day, leaving us vodka-less that evening as we were getting ready to go out. Having said all this, I do want to reiterate that overall this was a very nice stay and we would definitely consider The Park on a return trip to beautiful Amsterdam.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle/Italy", "Title": "\u201cReally great service, incredibly comfy beds and great location.\u201d", "Author": "UpNorth2010", "ReviewID": "UR99029551", "Content": "I chose this hotel as it was reccommended to me by my dad who had stayed there 10 years ago and I liked the look of the website. The location was great, right next to the museums and bars and you could walk everywhere. I used the shuttle bus from the airport straight to the hotel and back again at a cost of 25euros. You can do it on public transport and I am sure it would of been cheaper but as I arrived late and I was on my own I played it safe. When I checked in I was told that they had run out of standard rooms and so I had been given a suite (what a shame!). However, I wasn't that impressed with the suite, as all it was was an additional room with a work area in it. I am guessing for business people. But the bed was amazing, really modern bathroom, bottled water, TV with English channels and it was really clean. Unfortunately the room was very noisy (on the street with the trams) and had an external light that shone right into my room (gap between the wall and the curtain). I didn't sleep well at all. But, to the hotel's credit, they moved me straight away to a room further up the hotel and at the back. And they sent me a letter apologising, which I didn't expect. This room was perfect, in the eves, just as beautiful, sofa, TV that moved so you could watch it from the bed or seating area, double sinks in the bathroom. Really lovely. So I was very happy for the remaining 2 nights of my stay. The Living Room area was lovely, with lots of interesting books to read and good wine/coffee/snacks available. Perfect for a few drinks in the evening. I didn't eat in MOMO or have breakfast as the breakfast was 23/25 euros per day. Pretty steep for breakfast. I am curious to hear that other people seem to have had their breakfast included in the price. I looked on lots of websites and couldn't find one that included it. I got a good rate-around 80/90 per night without breakfast on ebookers. I think it was well worth it- especially with the upgrade.

The wet room floor meant we had to use towels to mop up water, which leaked everywhere after using the shower, a bit of a pain when getting ready for a night out. On a positive note the bed was the one of the comfiest we have ever slept in and the multi colour lights were pretty funky! It was a plus to have a little balcony too. We got a full breakfast included in the room rate which we decided to get sent to the room at 9am at a cost of 3.50 euros.

Why ironing rooms still exist in a hotel as nicely renovated as the Park Hotel is still a mystery - on a business trip the last thing that you want to do is to trek to a different part of the hotel to iron your shirts. Also, some rooms catch a lot of noise from the trams - but this is the flip side of the great location.

Something which isn't actually stated in their room service info- it is, however, in the Dutch version from what I could make out. Internet use is extremely expensive at 19.50 euro for 24 hours. That's about the most expensive I've seen around the world!!! \u00c2\u00a0Most good hotels give you so much time for free.

We got a superior room on the 5th floor, it was quiet and comfortable. We're from the US and saw a lot of reviews complaining about the room size but we didn't think it was bad and found it easy to open up our bags and spread out all our stuff, besides it's a hotel room, it doesn't need to be huge. We went to Paris from here and our room there was much smaller. The hotel is in a great location with tons of restaurants, shops and museums close by, not to mention the beautiful Vondel Park. The Hard Rock across the canal was a let down, there are better Hard Rock's in other locations, don't waste your money. We never ate the breakfast at the hotel it seemed a bit expensive and Momo was always packed so we didn't eat there either but like I said there are a ton of great places near by. I can't remember the names of the streets but across the canal and a block or two down there's a big square and a main road the #5 tram goes down. There you'll find the Hoopman Irish pub - Amazing, Pancake Corner - Amazing, down the main street is Wok to Walk - Amazing, B&B Lunchroom - Amazing (get the waffle with strawberries) and just off the main street is Bagels and Beans - Amazing (I had the best latte there). We only took the tram to get to the hotel from the airport and to get to Central Station, otherwise everything was in walking distance and that or renting a bike is a great way to experience this beautiful city. Ever person we met there was so friendly! I highly recommend the canal cruise thats across the street from the hotel, we did that our first night there. The red light is a must too although it's super touristy, it's almost like visiting Disneyland but for obvious reasons...different. What I found really neat and a bit ironic was there were a ton of swans swimming in the canal in the Red Light. When we checked out we still had a lot of time before our train to Paris so the hotel held our bags for us. What's also nice is you can buy your museum tickets at the hotel so you can bypass some of the long lines! We also read a lot of reviews about the bathroom flooding when you take a shower and I'm so confused, it never flooded once for us, the shower was great and the tub was really deep and so nice after a long day of walking.

It was the only time it happened during my stay, and it didn't put me off the hotel at all, but they probably need to do more to tackle this issue, even though I'm sure they're not the only hotel with this problem.

The re-furbishment is not without design flaws, e.g. shower screens that don't stop water flooding the bathroom floor.

Frankly, I have no idea how. All I can say is, what a disappointment! The whole time I felt as though we were an \"inconvenience\" to the staff at the Park. The reservations agent was rude and brusque with me when I inquired about changing our reservations dates due to the volcano travel delays. Thankfully this shortened the time we were due to stay at the Park, because I had no idea what I was getting myself into. We were given an awful, cramped room in the corner of the hotel (AND charged the same rate as any other room - 199 Euro per night - a complete rip off!). We could hardly walk around the bed, and were uncomfortable every moment we were in there. We literally had to move the desk chairs into the bathroom in order to walk around and find places for our luggage. The cleaning service was terrible. The bed sheets had a dark (blood?) stain on them from a previous guest (TOTALLY gross), and we had to call down to the front desk every evening to ask that our coffee maker supplies and bathroom soaps be restocked. The second time we called down, we had to call again an hour later to \"remind\" the front desk to take care of this issue. You'd think after making this mistake one day, the next day the problem would have been fixed, but no. Each evening the entire 4th floor stinks to high heaven of FISH thanks to the \"uber-chic\" restaurant MOMO on the first floor. YUCK.

Sorry, allowing me to spend 10 minutes online to double-check my email is not worth 25 EURO. The one nice thing about our stay was that the bicycle rental service was very good - we got bikes in fantastic shape (though the rental prices were double the going rate in Amsterdam).

We loved playing cards by the fire downstairs with the chill out music playing late in the evening after a long day on our feet - and whilst we didn't eat dinner at MOMO, it smelt divine! The service at the desk was slightly brusque but I'm not sure that it wasn't just the one girl as every other member of staff were pleasant and helpful. We were given our room (517) and dutifully went over to the lift where we were directed. Despite there being two perfectly good, recently refurbed lifts, apparently they don't go to our room(?) so we were taking what seemed akin to a service lift. It didn't even have proper doors so you had to stand in the middle away from the passing floors! Anyway when we got to our floor and room we realised that we'd been given a room on a floor that was in the middle of being refurbed (evident from all the building debris around). Happily, the room itself seemed post-refurb but without the much hyped 'customer changed lighting system' from the website. Not even sure what this would be! We also didn't have the toilet and shower inside the bedroom as critiqued in previous posts on this site, I was very happy - the bathroom was stylish, big and very luxurious feeling. I had a really lovely bath on the first evening and an amazing rain shower the next day ;o) My only gripe is that the room was FREEZING when we checked in and took hours whilst we were out to heat up, and the window were incredibly drafty. The mattress was initially comfortable, being a queen size and with lovely sheets but actually it was too soft and both my boyfriend and I came away with sore backs after just one night! We were a bit disappointed with the lack of storage space which would be a problem were we staying longer, the wifi is not free, and the snacks for the mini bar were placed above the safe next to the kettle/teas and coffees in such a way as to appear like complimentary snacks but they were not ! The breakfast is fantastic, served in MOMO, and the hotel itself is in an amazing location, close to Leidesplein and Vondelpark but it seems at the moment to be a work in progress.

The hotel rooms are lovely (we were given a free upgrade) with TV, tea/coffee making facilities and a super comfy bed! The hotel also has a gorgeous restaurant next door Momo which we ate at-the food was delicious and atmosphere relaxed and plush with gorgeous cocktails and a dj. I'd recommend doing a bike ride with yellow bike company, it was fantastic and allowed us to see places and landmarks we may have missed or not had time to see! Anne Franks house is a must!

Not what I expect of a European hotel and certainly not when I've called as a result of their flooding shower.

Well, at twenty odd euro, save your cash and go elsewhere, fast! The variety and quality was ok, but not worth half the price. Most annoyingly, their wifi was exceptionally overpriced at Twenty Euro for Twenty Four hours. I had to make use of the service for work, it operated fine but I though they were seriously mugging me by charging a rate I can only describe as 'thieving'.

We last visited 2 years ago. The hotel has a great location in southern central Amsterdam. We caught a taxi from Centraal Station and it cost 13 euros. You could quite easily get a tram but with luggage we couldn't be bothered. The hotel is situated on a main road with a canal bang opposite. It's also within easy walking distance of Liedesplein and also has the Hard Rock Cafe and an Irish pub opposite. It's also in the museum quarter and the opposite end of town from the seedier Amsterdam districts. On arrival we couldn't believe the change. When we visited before the hotel was undergoing a big refurb and you could choose whether you stopped in the old part or the newly refurbished part. We had a superb modern room that was massive on that occasion! The reception area had been totally moved and looked amazing, the check in experience was spoiled slightly by some rude American bloke. We were stood about 6 feet away from the person in front of us (can't stand people who stand over my shoulder in queues!) when this guy just waltzed to the front and started lecturing the reception girl!! Not the hotels fault but it would have been nice if she'd have sent him to the back of the queue rather than serve him and apologise afterwards! Once again we had one of the newly refurbished rooms although this time it was a lot smaller. The shower cubicle and toilet closet were around 4 feet from our bed (seperated by the sink) which is not great if you're in a new relationship at not 100%comfortable with each other!!! The other problem was that although the shower was superb and an experience in itself, it did leak through the seals at the bottom of the door. This happened in our previous room a couple of years ago but as previously mentioned, the room was a lot bigger. The water ran into the toilet cubicle next door meaning we had a pool of water a couple of cm's deep for the rest of our stay! The bed was again, one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on. After an afternoon of trailling round 'Dam in the cold it was nice to have a couple of hours in a lovely warm bed before going out for dinner. One let down was the MOMO restaurant next door. We only popped in for a coffee during the afternoon. It was well designed and reminded of a hotel bar in New York. Most of the tables were taken so we took a seat at the bar. There was no sign of any bar staff during the 15 minutes we waited and we must have been one of 6 other couples waiting at the bar. I did notice a couple of ladies sat tutting and looking at their watches for a while before their drinks arrived.....must have been waiting a while I guess. We enquired about breakfast to be told it was 18 euros......dont bother....go to the Irish pub opposite, full English breakfast for 11 euros. All in all another good stay and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this hotel to friends. Upon checking out we were asked if we had consumed anything from the mini bar (we hadn't). The guy on reception didn't seem to believe us and he asked again!! I didn't think anything of this until I checked my credit card a couple of days after returning. I found a \u00c2\u00a36 charge on there for the mini bar!!! I know it's not much but it's the principal of the thing. I've emailed but heard nothing yet.

I highly recomend this hotel if you want a clean, comfortable and modern stay in Amsterdam.", "Date": "November 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin", "Title": "\u201cLovely modern hotel - be weary of executive rooms!\u201d", "Author": "maver1ck", "ReviewID": "UR49491370", "Content": "I've just returned from 3 nights stay at the Park Hotel.

We had booked the executive room which oh dear is absolutely lovely to look at with its LCD tv, mood lighting, underfloor heating area & modern look BUT the designers had one major flaw! The shower and toilet are incorporated into the room. There is no seperate room for toilet & shower and this was very off putting. You had a sheer curtain that pulled across from the bed to seperate the room and you walked into a cubicle no bigger than a standard public toilet cubicle as your toilet. TV volume was raised when bathroom was used and its a shame as everything else about this hotel was excellent. The hotel is located in a lovely area of amsterdam about 15 mins walk to Dam Square, beside Van Gogh museum. You can take the 1,2,5 tram from across the road to the centre of the city in less than 10 minutes. Word of warning, you have to pay 20 euro a day to use the wi-fi in your room which is ridiculous.

The hotel is located in a trendy part of Amsterdam a couple of blocks away from the fashion district & near 2 large parks, the Museumplein and the Vondelpark. Also within easy walking distance of the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum. Just across from road the hotel is a canal with trip barges around the city. Very wothwhile. The transport system, trains, trams & metro all intergrate well. Its well worth buying a daily travel ticket from the hotel that gives you access the city. Its easy to walk around too but watch out for the speeding bicyles, scooters & motor bikes that all use the citys bike lanes \"on the pavement\". Breakfast in the hotel is very expensive- 25 Euros per person but we were offered a deal for 18 Euros each per day. The breakfast is fantastic. I `ve never seen such a choice of food that sets you up for the day. We didnt eat again until dinner. We had to change our hotel room after the 1st night as there was a bad smell of sewage.

The Park is sleek and modern. The lobby, called the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Living Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, includes a gas fireplace next to comfy chairs and couches where one can sit, sip a glass of wine, and have a pleasant conversation. Through the Living Room are the Concierge and the reception desks. Everyone was most helpful and made me feel welcome. Upon check-in, guests are given a coupon for a complimentary drink at Momo, the on-site bar and restaurant. Guest rooms are larger than one might expect for Europe, and feature a contemporary design theme that struck me as almost stark. Not my personal taste, but well done nonetheless. The rooms are equipped with mini-bars, coffee and tea, an in-room safe, and iron and ironing board. The bathroom has a drench showerhead, typically deep European tub, a hair dryer, and high-end amenities. I received a pre-paid rate of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac119 per night, which I found fairly reasonable. Wireless Internet access is available in the rooms for about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 per day. The Park has shared computers near the reception desk where one can also get Internet access for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 for 15 minutes. Within a few blocks, however, there are several Internet access points where the rates are quite a bit lower if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re willing to put up with the inconvenience. On the lower level, the Park has the best-equipped hotel fitness center I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen. Guests can use treadmills, an elliptical trainer, free weights, and weight machines, all while watching one of two big-screen TVs. On the ground floor, Momo offers a variety of sushi and Asian-themed dishes that are well prepared and nicely presented, though a bit on the expensive side. Drinks at the bar seemed pretty reasonable at around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 each. Among the Park\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positives is its location. Situated on a main canal between the Fashion and Museum District and the entertainment area known as the Leidseplein, it has easy access to a wide range of attractions, restaurants, and transportation options without being in the middle of the action as soon as you step out the front door. Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous Museum District, about two blocks southeast of the Park, boasts the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, the House of Bols (reputedly the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest spirits manufacturer) and its Cocktail & Genever Experience, and the Diamant Museum. Two large parks, the Museumplein and the Vondelpark, are also within easy walking distance. Across the canal to the northwest is the Leidseplein with a wide variety of restaurants. My personal favorite, simply because it is distinctly Dutch, is a snack shop called Febo where one buys traditional Dutch \u00e2\u20ac\u0153krokets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (deep-fried, roll-formed snacks containing various types of meat) from dispensers that resemble an updated version of the Horn & Hardart Automat. The locals call that eating \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uit de muur\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153from the wall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At the other end of the spectrum, the area also has outlets from international chains including the Hard Rock Caf\u00c3\u00a9. The Holland Casino is also in the area. More interesting, however, are the locally run restaurants, bars, and old pubs that line the side streets. Many of the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s older drinking establishments are known locally as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brown caf\u00c3\u00a9s\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so called because years of cigarette smoke (banned in most Amsterdam establishments since July 2008) turned the walls brown. Many offer bar food, including simple toasted sandwiched; some do not. Near the Park are stops where one can catch the Canalbus for a waterborne tour of Amsterdam, hop on the tram, or catch a bus. The Park also rents mopeds (which share the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bicycle paths) for about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac49 a day, and rents bicycles as well. Guests at the Park can buy tickets to many of the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s museums and attractions at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front desk at the same price you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d pay at the attraction. Buying the tickets at the hotel can save you a lengthy wait in the ticket line at your destination. The front desk also sells tickets to the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tram and bus system.", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, good value, good location near tram, some small issues\u201d", "Author": "dieselbp67", "ReviewID": "UR47427629", "Content": "We stayed at the Park Hotel after looking around a bit on trip advisor, and found a good price (I think around 130Euros). The website also is very nicely done and made the hotel really stand out from others. The service was good on arrival and throughout the stay, so no real comments there. I was on the fifth floor in the older section of the hotel, so I actually had to take the elevator to the fourth floor and walk up a flight to the fifth floor. A lil different than what I am used to, but no problems with that. I just wanted to mention it so if any readers of this review would prefer to not have to do that, they will know ahead of time. When I got to the fifth floor there was a little bit of an odd smell, I wasnt sure what it was. I think it may have been from the housekeeping/laundry area. It wasn't a big problem, just something I noticed. The room was nice, safe, minibar, cool decorations. The bed is def on the soft side, but I still had no problem sleeping in it. The bathroom though is weird. Actually there is no real bathroom, its just right there in your room. There is a sink area, a toilet and a shower. First, it's def a lil uncomfortable for those of us who would like a little privacy when using a bathroom. Second, the shower door and floor set up probably wasn't designed correctly because when you shower the tile floor and the carpet of the room gets soaking wet. Housekeeping takes care of it, but there is a slight musty smell in the general area. The actual shower when you are in it is fantastic, great pressure from the rainfall head. So overall the room is comfortable and clean and does the job. TV is nice also. They also have this whole \"living room\" concept in the lobby where you can relax and read and stuff. That was pretty interesting and I spent some time there. Room service - only ordered late night dining once and it was fantastic. It was some kind of pie and wow. Totally would recommend that. The location of the hotel is really good. It's near the museums, and right by bus and tram stops to take you anywhere else you want to go. In the vicinity there are also cafes, coffeeshops, bars, and a casino. So thats pretty much the summary of the hotel, and I would recommend it for the right price. I saw the average price year round is very high, so I would look elsewhere if the price creeps up too high.

First off, it's not remotely modern or glamorous or funky, so if that was holding you back from staying here, don't be deterred. The furnishings are sort of modern and contemporary, but the overall vibe is very late '90s and stale. What should deter you from staying here are the following: (1) expensive internet connections at an outrageous 20 euros a day, (2) too-soft, uncomfortable beds, (3) dank bathrooms that are clean enough but incredibly musty-smelling, and (4) a a lot of loud, obnoxious people taking over the hotel restaurant on weekends. During the week, the vibe is mostly businesspeople and quiet. The location is decent if your main priority is the Van Gogh and Rijk museums, but the most lovely parts of town with the classic canal houses and interesting boutiques/galleries/restaurants are a good 20-minute walk away. The concierge service was mediocre. Our first request was for a place to have breakfast. The concierge mentioned a place. We asked, half-kiddingly, whether she was sending us to a good place or a touristy place. She said, \"Oh, you want a place that's actually good?\" When we said yes, she directed us someplace else. It's disappointing that the concierge assumes all her guests are ignorant tourists with no taste, but that's apparently what she did.

The shower and toilet cubicles do have doors but these do not lock, nor do they reach the top or bottom of the cubicle. I've been with my girlfriend now for a number of years but there are still some things you want to keep, ahem, private! Also the shower has two heads, one for a regular shower and one for a 'rainfall' shower. Our rainfall shower wasnt working, and the regular one came on with such power that it nearly flooded the bedroom. But anyway, that is really a minor complaint and didnt detract from our stay at the hotel. The main reason we chose the Park was its location - 2 minutes away from the Rijksmuseum and Leidseplein, 1 minute from the Vondelpark and little more than 10 minutes walk from the busy Dam Square which in turn is 5 minutes from the red light district and coffee shop area.

While its location is convenient, there were just too many other inconveniences from the very beginning to warrant recommending it to anyone. First of all, as we always do when making hotel reservations, we had requested non-feather pillows before our arrival because I have asthma and am extremely allergic to down. There were feather pillows on our bed when we arrived, and when we requested different ones, not only did we wait a long time (and we were anxious to get out in the city) before anyone showed up at our door, the housekeeping person finally came and told us that he had been looking everywhere for non-down pillows and insisted that the ones he was holding were the only ones he could find. They turned out to be feather ones again. We wound up having to go downstairs ourselves to complain to the desk manager, who finally was able to find the appropriate pillows. The inconveniences continued....although there was a note saying that the bottles of water provided for us were free, there were no bottles of water provided other than the ones in the mini-bar. There was no ironing board, nor iron, and when we inquired because we had wanted to use one, we were told that they were all \"out\" and that if we wanted to iron anything we would have to go iron in a different room in the hotel. There were lights missing in the bathroom, and the only lights in the actual hotel room were one small and dimly-lit floor lamp, and dim colored lights (for which one could change the colors) behind the bed. There were reading lights coming out of the wall, but they were miniscule and malfunctioning. There were not enough towels and the shower flooded the bathroom because of the design of the shower door. In addition, the hallways of the hotel were poorly vacuumed, and when the housekeeping cart was in the hallway, it took up the entire space, making it almost impossible for even a normal-sized person to pass. All in all, considering the price of a room at this hotel, these inconveniences were unacceptable... there were lots of superficial minimalist design aspects to the hotel and room interiors, which they use to promote their hotel, however this is an example of form over function and comfort.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Place, Perfect Location.\u201d", "Author": "LindseySheffield", "ReviewID": "UR38774265", "Content": "Myself, my Husband & our friends stayed for one night & it was brilliant.

We had 4 huge pieces of luggage, 2 pretty big carry-on bags and still had enough room to move around. The room and the bathroom were very clean and the bed was very comfortable. The room had an electric tea-kettle and it was very convenient to have a cup of tea or coffee in the morning with a croissant from the local grocery store! The location is the best in the city: all major museums are just a few steps away (Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum), Rembrandt House and Anne Frank House are 20 -25 minutes of walking. The Canal Tour is right across the street. Leidseplein square is right behind the corner. It's an ideal location! The staff was extremely friendly: check in and check out were fast. Initially we had a room with a Canal view, but the noise from the street really bothered me during the night. After I mentioned it we were immediately given a new room facing the back yard (nice and quiet). And when we returned after our cruise to stay one more night - they already had a note and gave us a quiet room even without us mentioning it! Great service!

For weeks before the visit I had been on their website to get a feel for the hotel and the area, it looked like they had taken pictures of somewhere else! It was late and we were tired, so we just went to bed with a view to seeing how we felt in the morning. We were woken early by drilling and banging only to realise that our window lead out to the forecourt of the building works, and the builders could see straight into our room (our curtains were closed but the night before we couldnt see out there!). We went straight to the reception where we told them our issues with the room and said how unhappy we were there, they told us to put our bags on the beds in the room and they would move our stuff for when we got back from our morning coffee. I know this all sounds like the start of a horrid time, but that really was the only problem, they sorted out the problem as soon as we told them and were very apologetic. I got a letter of apology from the hotel manager later that day, which I thought was a nice thought. If you have a problem with your room, rather than silently seething, go and speak to someone. They dont know anything is wrong unless you tell them. Our second room was perfect. It was as the internet had shown and I can only assume the hotel was upgrading all of the rooms like this and we were in one of the few remaining old, nasty rooms. Why they put us in that one to begin with I have no idea, but I was very happy once we were moved. The hotel is in a fabulous location, its much quieter than Dam Square end, but its not far to get to. I like walking around new places, and a 20min walk is nothing to me. If, however, you dont like walking such distances, the tram is very well located all over the city and very easy to use. Locals are all very friendly and will speak to you (with no hidden agenda) while waiting for the bus/tram. Ask you how your stay is and where you are from. I could live in Amsterdam very happily.

I dont understand why they did that as some people like to get a little fresh air sometimes. A kettle was missing from my room but a call to the front desk sorted this out. The bed though was so uncomfortable. It's foam on top of a base and one end of it was so worn down my legs ended up higher than my head. The pillows are also a bit soft. I ended up moving to the other end and sleeping the other way round. It was much better. Others have commented on how comfy they found the bed, but in my case I've never slept in such an uncomfortable bed so I guess it varies. The general feeling is the hotel is nice and the staff friendly and courteous, room nice with great view, nice general areas and in a great location, but bed was uncomfortable and disappointing no \"step out\" balcony. I'd be happy to recommend it to a friend but I'd definitely mention the bed.", "Date": "February 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDidn't quite live up to the image\u201d", "Author": "JMBe", "ReviewID": "UR25332948", "Content": "The location is excellent, bang next-door to the museums, and so convenient for transport into the rest of the city.

Like most, I am a traveler who expects to get what is advertised and what is paid for. As far as reviews go, I could be considered a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair-weather\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reviewer. I love to make a recommendation and/or review only when I am extremely satisfied or extremely dissatisfied. This is my 3rd trip in 2009 and my first review. What has prompted this review is how horrible this hotel was on so many levels. I have been to Amsterdam 5 times over the past 2 years; staying from hostel to hotel, no star rating to 4 stars and with exception to this trip feel I received everything I paid for. United should be ashamed for recommending this hotel with a 4 star rating. Hotel is situated in a good location, and walking into the hotel was quite impressive. I believed that the rude and condescending hotel staff just was a part of staying at a nice hotel, and by the looks of the lobby this was going to be a great hotel. Well designed and comfortable, the lobby is exactly as photographed and described. In an almost empty hotel, I still had to wait until the 2PM check-in time, which I do understand is usual and should be expected. But it is the unexpected that makes a 4+ star hotel, especially in these hard times. And especially since the room was available to me. Still the lobby was so nice, so I was patient. It was so nice in fact> I inquired at the desk if they could accommodate me for 3 more nights- Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. Knowing the online rate, I was further curious regarding what the quote was going to be. On the (weeknights remember) that I requested, the quote was 40% more that advertised online (in an almost empty hotel.) I still seriously considered it. Fortunately, I decided to wait until 2PM check-in so I would have the privacy to check prices again online and to call United to reschedule my flight. Room is grossly exaggerated. GROSSLY! The bed was comfortable, though. It was like the rooms were an afterthought. Furthermore, no aromatherapy as described, just some low budget toiletries. Similar to Best Western, Vegas. The tragic continental breakfast opens at 7AM, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think if you get down there at 6:45 you can get a cup of coffee from one of the 2 coffee machines the hotel has. Because all you will get is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the restaurant opens at 7, sorry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Again, the little extra it would of taken to say yes would have been the difference between expected and unexpected\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 especially since the door man that told me this was drinking a coffee from the machine. On the last hours of my trip (Sunday morning,) as I sat in the restaurant, my opinion of this hotel was sealed. Up till now, I chalked off the rude and condescending staff as just a language barrier, I am a very reasonable person. Figure I must be because to chalk it off as a barrier would ignore the fact that most of them spoke some English, and ignore the fact that my other 4 stays in Amsterdam have been fabulous. Anyway, I met the one person, who to confirm all things, one of two nice employees at the hotel. (There was one pleasant woman at the front desk.) Anyway, I was sitting there almost ready to choke down one more horrible free breakfast, when I saw a mouse running along side of the breakfast bar. Mind you, I have lived in cities with rats the size of small cats, so I am not grossed out or scared. The lady setting up the buffet walked by so I mentioned it to her. I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have a little helper there.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Suddenly the sour-puss face that seemed to be a hotel policy dropped off her face and she became the 2nd nice person I met employed by the hotel. No more language barrier, or attitude ((and she spoke the least English of everyone>>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but made her way through how they have tried traps and poisons and still cant get rid of him. And with an// If You Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Beat Em, Join Em attitude, said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so we named him Chip!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And in ending, I am home reviewing my statement and the Park Hotel has 2 unauthorized pending transactions on my credit card, One for $+450 USD and one for $+580 USD. Disputing once posts, but worries me now. Last thing you want to deal with 5000 Miles away on Jet Lag. To the future traveler, I hope that this review is considered very seriously in deciding your stay. I was extremely dissatisfied, good luck on your decision. And to the hotel, Hire an exterminator only after you hire some sort of Customer Relations Supervisor. It is sad that a rodent infestation is second to your miserable staff. There is no reason that any guest should leave your 4 star hotel feeling mistreated, robbed and lied to. I did the research and paid the price because I wanted this trip to Amsterdam to be more relaxing than my normal Amsterdam party. I will only be satisfied if United credits me on the hotel portion of my vacation, since your hotel and your staff could only smirk and say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "co.antrim", "Title": "\u201cnot the place we thought it would be\u201d", "Author": "ulsterelks", "ReviewID": "UR24941947", "Content": "After reading a lot of reviews we thought this must be the hotel to stay and i know people like different thing but this hotel was not for us.We were able to check in as soon as we arrived wich was about 11am which was good but as we booked the rooms (2) together we thought we would be beside each other but we got 1 on floor 1 and 1 on floor 2 .After looking on the webside we thought the rooms were a good size but how wrong we were ,after having a shower we were able to have a bath on the floor after as half the room flooded ,the bed were very uncomfortable to sleep on and the pillows are very soft so i asked for 2 more but the never arrived, the breakfast is ok but not worth 23 euro, our room overlooked the back covered in portacabins but is was quite ,my wife sister and husband were in a room at the side of the hotel and didnt got much sleep with the noise of the trams and the nightclub down below.The location is not to bad but there are a lot of hotels more central and at a better price.I know some people do and some dont but when checking out make sure to check your bill as we got charged for an extra breakfast.", "Date": "February 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly acceptable\u201d", "Author": "beccy12001", "ReviewID": "UR24938685", "Content": "Stayed here for a short break in Amsterdam in August 2008.

Its very clean, and the bed is super comfy! The bathroom arrangement in many rooms is a bit odd. The sink is right next to the bed, and there is a separate toilet and shower cubicles that open right out onto a tiled area in the room, with frosted glass doors. There isn't a huge amount of privacy, and sometimes water from the shower can leak under the door onto the tiled area as there isn't a watertight seal, but this wasn't a big issue. Rooms are cleaned every day. Other negative points are that if the people next door are being quite loud, you can hear them as the walls are quite thin but most of the time it was fine. Also, the restaurant in the hotel is very expensive. Following the recent renovation, the hotel does look very nice, with lovely touches everywhere. But I think that all the renovations are superficial and I might be disappointed if I had paid a lot of money to stay here.

I am not sure were to start on this review, it was that bad. Firstly check under the bed and sofa or chairs, especially if you have young children. We found sweets, rubbish, money and pills. I could not believe it - the cleaners are awful - the rooms are filthy. Then the smell of drains in the lobby - oh it looks sexy, but you can't stand the smell so can't use the area. They are apparently aware of this issue, but come on it's a 4 start hotel?! What else, the service. I was asked to pay a 40 euros charge for our pre-paid breakfast. Then after informing them we were asked to stand in front of everyone eating while they checked - nice. The noise. If it's windy and you are on the fifth floor take ear plugs. The wind noise off the roof, will keep you up, or the noise from one of the service rooms were cleaners enter and exit at all hours. They seam to also have washing machines going in them and that's not a nice noise while staying away from home. I could go on and on there was a lot of shabby service and details here, doors chipped and stained carpets are the start of it.

Although, I have been advised that where the hotel is situated and the surrounding area is well known for its ridiculously high prices. So please make sure that you bring enough money esp if you plan to eat in this area and not travel for your meals as 3 nights here cost us \u00c2\u00a3450. For me, this is a lot of money for two people and all we did was eat out two or three times a day (not in exceptionally great restaurants just little cafe places) - thats it - didnt go to museums, there was no night life while we were there (Tues to fri) and we dont drink anyway! So Anyway, the hotel - really nice for a european hotel. We got an excellent deal with expedia and the flights were cheap so I was really impressed. The superior rooms are quite small but I have stayed in smaller, its a bit strange how the sink is near the bed and the shower and toilet are in your bedroom with a bit of a glass divider and curtain. The bed is soooo comfortable but if you have a bad back then its not good idea as my boyfriend has a really bad back and he couldnt get up in the morning!!!! The TV is nice, the room is modern and and well decorated. Movies are expensive (13 euros) Momo the bar/restaurant in the hotel is a great place to sit for a drink and dinner although I didnt try any food in there, the kitchen is open and I saw them preparing and cooking food it looked very appetizing. One of the managers gave us a free drink each in Momo because it was my birthday. The staff are really attentive and polite. The weather was absolutely freezing and for some reason the streets were very quiet. We spoke to an owner of a bar in Leidsplein and she said that they were losing a lot of money, people were not out or if they do come out it would be between midnight and 3am. Restaurants were also empty it was very strange. I'm glad I didnt come here with a group of friends for a few nights out as we would have been very disappointed. I know this isnt the norm as friends that had gone previously a few months ago were out every night and it was very busy. The redlight district was very entertaining! We enjoyed walking past the windows, very interesting!

This was not our first, second, third, fourth, fifth, etc. choice. But we chose to go to Amsterdam during the International Broadcast Conference, and really, it was nearly impossible to find a room. Because of the conference, the prices were ludicrous. The first night was about $500, with each successive night a little less expensive. The art deco lobby was cool, and you think, wow, this might be neat. Then you hear the directions to your room. You literally turn the corner and leave the art deco behind and arrive in a dinghy, scary hallway. Then the elevator is pretty much an old freight elevator converted for guests. Then it's another flight of stairs up to the fifth floor where our room was. Upon entering the hallway, the first thing I noticed was the smell. To me, it was like stale trash lingering in the hallway. It never went away. The room was ... interesting. The bed was amazingly comfortable, and it had funky lighting so you could sleep in your own private red light district, or blue light, or yellow, or green, or white. You get the idea. The bathroom area was cramped, and the shower -- yes, it's exactly as everyone says ... flood, flood, flood. We tried everything, but the most we got was ... less flooding. We had a room overlooking the road, so it was very noisy. And, it just didn't feel clean, I wanted to walk through the room with an antibacterial wipe, and believe it or not, I am decidedly not a germaphobe. The location was extraordinary ... you can't fault that, and if you don't mind the smell, the shower, etc. this is a good place. It is kind of funky. But weirdly, this was our last stop on our European honeymoon, and this was the only place we met rude staff. But we laughed it off, things like, you can only get the full breakfast buffet in MOMO, you can't get just a coffee, well, you can, but they'll only serve it to you in the lobby. But did I mention the bed was super comfy? I can't say this place was horrible, only that we would never stay here again.

The next day we were eventually given a new room (one of the refurbished ones) and they moved our suitcases over to the next room which was nice. The new room was nicely decorated but so small you could not swing a cat! There is no bathroom, only a white see through curtain seperates the bed from the sink. There are stained glassdoors to a seperate shower and toilet, but unless you like being in full view whilst going to the toilet this is not great. The water from the shower leaks out on all sides when using it so make sure you go to the toilet before you have a shower (unless you want wet feet!).

We could hear them going down the hallway immediately after knocking on all the doors.

Having booked through Expedia, when a fourth member was to join our party I phoned them to upgrade one of the rooms from a single to a double. They told me there would be a charge of \u00c2\u00a3111.00 to which I was shocked and phoned the Hotel directly who said that there would be no problem sorting out an upgrade once we arrive. When we arrived at the Hotel ( there are now 4 adults in our group ) I mentioned that I had spoken earlier to someone about the upgrade which they confirmed. Two of our party were going to share a room ( the double ) whilst myself and another colleague decided that we would spend a little extra and upgrade to a Superior room. This however seemed a little to much for the receptionist to cope with and after calling her manager for help they both struggled with the computer screen in front of them and finally turned round and said that we would all be upgraded to a double room! Not what we requested. ( and we were to be charged...no free upgrade here, not that we were looking for it ) Rather than confuse them any more I just agreed and said that I would pay the upgrade fee for all the rooms on departing. As most people feel after arriving by plane and then travelling by Taxi all you want to do is retire to the room, drop off the bags and venture out! Well the first night was hell, the double room that I had been given ( no. 153 ) was the noisiest Hotel room that I have ever stayed in. The heating pipes clattered and banged all night, there was one thick pipe that must have been supplying the whole hotel through my room, there was no heating control for the room and with the window open the noise was a little too much to sleep. In addition to this I think I was located next to the service elevator as ever few minutes there was a loud electrical hum that vibrated through the pillow. Well after no sleep and seeing that the clock said 6:30am I decided to have another go at upgrading to a Superior room. Got dressed and ventured downstairs, this time there was a different face at the reception and this face was able to give me what I had originally asked for. zzz... Better room, newly decorated and had a minibar ( ah, cold water! ) after getting up and out for a lovely walk around the Leidseplein Square area I started to itch....yes I had been bitten three times on the left shoulder and upper arm by flees.

From the lobby, to the restaurant, bar and actual bedroom. Carpets ripped and stained. Furniture very shabby. There is no way this could be considered a 4 star on this planet. And this was after we were upgraded (another trick?) to their Executive suite/floor. Weak back office systems. Like many other reviewers, we had our reservation confused. While we were (trying to?) check in, next to us, a US hip-hop group (Dilated Peoples?) was struggling to get their reservation sorted. Even the final bill had a couple errors plus a surprise tax. Look over your paperwork carefully. --- Overall, this was a decent hotel in a fantastic location. The pros definitely outweigh the cons. These guys are trying hard. But the hotel owners are obviously reluctant to invest in some refurbishment.

What a fabulous, and fabulously entertaining city! Last time I went, about three months ago, it resulted in a somewhat euphemistically pre-anaesthetised broken ankle. This time, I determined to keep myself just that little bit more sober. I booked flights and then turned to the infamous Priceline in order to book accommodation of some sort. For the centre of the \"action\", you really can't do an awful lot better than the Crowne Plaza City Centre or, say, the Golden Tulip. For the Leidesplein, Rijksmuseum and a spot of culture, you'll certainly enjoy the Park hotel. And that's exactly where I was allocated. There are a load of very decent hotels in this particular region. Don't get me wrong - I adore art. The Rijksmuseum, next door, is, however, apparently closed for the next 18 months or so due to major refurbishment and my agenda meant that planned entertainments - nothing terribly untoward, you understand - meant a tram ride into the real centre. Tram lines 2 and 5 will certainly do the trick. I messed up, however, and ended walking both ways. Probably 20-30 minutes. No real problem. I'm amazed at my sense of direction. I needed it! I'd hunted down 5-star hotels on Priceline. No luck. Similarly, I fruitlessly checked out their selection of 4-star hotels. So I opted for the 3-star level, and got a night at the Park Hotel for a very decent rate of \u00c2\u00a345 per night. Something of a steal as, for once, I would actually take issue with the 3-star rating. If nothing else, the rating is certainly somewhat marginal. Located next to one of Amsterdam's canals (where you can buy tickets for canal tours) it is an impressive building and I entered through the revolving door to find that the reception area was spacious, reasonably luxurious and well-staffed. It was a quiet and peaceful haven. The receptionist really could not have been much more friendly nor helpful and it was not long before I had the key - and it was, indeed, a proper key - to room 221. I also had a welcome letter given to me, inviting me to enjoy a half-price breakfast in the morning. The offer price of 9.50 Euros would have been an exceptionally good deal if I had not preferred the alternative option of a post-very-late-night-lie-in to the \"American buffet breakfast\" that was on offer. Check-out time was 11:30am and I just about made it! I had a meeting with some friends and despite hunting down the venue the night before, could I find it? Nope! Probably because it had actually closed down two years previously. But soft! We did meet up. After checking in, at any rate, I was offered help with my luggage, but I was only carrying a small case and, having declined this, was pointed in the direction of the lift. The bar and restaurant, which I passed en route looked really welcoming. In Amsterdam, however, I think that there are better places to drink than hotel bars, so - for a change - I can't share my experience with you. I used neither. They did, however, look inviting if that's your thing, and the menus were interesting. Room service was also available 24 hours per day. I reached the lift. It was at this point that I realised that I was not staying in a terribly modern hotel. I pressed the button to summon the lift. It arrived. The doors don't slide open like in any normal 20th or 21st Century lift - nope - you pull them open like a room door and step inside. Select your floor and up you go - no internal door at all; just watch the wall slide down below you! Stand back! I've seen this once before in a budget hotel in Prague, and was truly amazed to see it again. Still, it got me safely to the second floor and my room was only a few steps away. I unlocked the room and ventured inside. I worked out how to use the lighting. Interesting room - yellow painted walls and blue carpeted floors, with two single beds pushed together to form a double. These were extraordinarily low-level and very soft. They actually provided a great night's sleep, I have to say. Standard hotel-issue remote-controlled TV with personalised welcome screen. The bathroom was reasonably large, was white and was spotlessly clean. The toiletries were decent, and the bath / shower combination was efficient; plenty of hot water. I just don't know how to sum up - it was very comfortable, and it was certainly more than adequate. It was, at the end of the day, somewhere to lay my rather weary head, and it was clean, comfortable and moderately luxurious. There was 24 hour room service. That's all you need in an Amsterdam hotel - in fact, it's probably more than you need. What probably stops me raving about the place is simply the fact that it just struck me as being somewhat tired. The reception area had an air of elegance about it yet, once out of the lift, the place had a certain shabby feeling about it. A water pipe, for instance, ran down the wall of my bedroom. Small point, but I just don't like to see such visible plumbing in my hotel room. Perhaps I'm just too picky! Check-out in the morning was friendly and efficient. Yes - I'd happily stay there again, but there are certainly better places to stay in Amsterdam - if only for the location. If you're more intent on doing the Art thing, however, this would certainly be a contender. Priceline have it down as a 3-star. Le Meridien have it down as a 4-star. I'm finding it quite hard to judge, to be honest. Customer service gives it a definite 4. The somewhat jaded fabric of the bedrooms leads me towards a 3. As a place to stay, well - it was more than adequate and I couldn't complain at the price; perhaps a star-rating is irrelevant - which is a cop-out. I guess that, whilst it would never be my first choice in Amsterdam for a variety of reasons, it suited its purpose pretty well and I've no real right, or need, whatsoever to complain.", "Date": "October 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cmajor works outside the Park Hotel Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2624473", "Content": "We stayed at the Park Hotel Amsterdam from 2nd Oct to 5th October last.

Although the suite was very nice, we were still a little bothered because it had only one bed (we needed two) and it did not have air-conditioning, which the club room we booked was supposed to have. To apologize, the management sent us a bottle of wine, which was a nice gesture. Overall, it was a comfortable hotel with all the amenities, although it's a little worn around the edges. The front desk staff were very friendly, with the exception of one sourpuss. However, they gave us misinformation on two occasions, regarding the opening hours of the Rijksmuseum and which tram to take to the Resistance Museum. The location is excellent -- the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum are right around the corner, along with trams and buses to the city centre. There is massive road construction going on outside the hotel and expected to last for at least a year, but we didn't hear any noise from it during our stay.
