This hotel was better than we even expected. The location was fantastic right on Rembrandt Square with many restaurants and cafe's and walking distance to many sites. The room was very nice and with a great view overlooking the square. The only drawback for some but not for us was that the square could be noisy at night even with the windows closed. For us the view and liveliness made up for the noise.

Rembrandt Square has so much to offer. The tram stop is 30 seconds outside the hotel door, which will take you to the Dam, Central Station and Anne Frank's House. The hotel itself is clean and comfortable. However, staff are not as friendly as they could be. They were polite and courteous but made no effort to go that extra mile. The breakfast is ridiculously expensive so we chose not to pay for breakfast. Instead there are lots of nice cafes around the square serving breakfast for much more reasonable prices. We liked Frame, where the staff was always very jolly. The wifi connection is also over priced and the hotel computer is painfully slow.

The hotel is a little dated but comfortable. If you're at the front you'll definitely need the complimentary earplugs that they leave by your bed. There's no AC so during the summer the noise from the square will probably be an issue unless you're getting to bed at six in the morning. The breakfast isn't bad but very Dutch with thin streaky bacon and quite the worse reconstituted scrambled eggs I've tasted for a long time. I went to the Irish bar across the road one morning but theirs was no better and gave me food poisoning.

You are a few steps away from great restaurants and some great attractions. The hotel looks good from the outside and walking in, you get a feeling of the old dutch grandeur. The rooms are quite roomy as well, with great views of the square. However, you pay for internet and a lot. It is 18 euros for one day of internet, and that is just ridiculous. Mobile internet (iPad included) is 8 euros. In this day and age, I don't get how high end hotels continue to charge for internet. Moreover, my bathroom smelled really bad. I was there for two nights, but I didn't want to bother changing rooms. I did regret it on the second night, but what is amazing is that the cleaning staff didn't smell it and address it. There is no air-conditioning in the hotel, so it might not be comfortable in summer. I was there in March and it was hot in my room, enough to keep me up at night. The bed is not very comfortable and it was two single beds put together. While I didn't order room service (you don't need to with the Burger Bar, and Wok to Walk a few meters away), the menu didn't have anything to tingle my taste buds. So I advise passing on this hotel.

Location The location is good, right next to the flower market. Getting round Amsterdam involves a lot of walking (you will be tired) and the hotel is right in the middle of everything you would want to see. We were able to pop back for a siesta after a long slog before we headed out again for food and a beer. Our trip was a mid week one, so I don't think we saw the full glory of the Rembrandtplein, but it has a club a couple of coffee houses (we liked the 80/90s alternative music in the one closest to the hotel), a scattering of restaurants and a pretty nice square with a statue of Rembrandt proudly standing in the middle. I would imagine at the weekend it would get lively. The accommodation It's a medium sized hotel, doesn't feel corporate and has a few nice touches. The reception people were very helpful, very friendly and welcoming - which was a great. Reading the reviews on here we were careful anyway and asked straight away for a quiet room and we got one on the second floor. The room was clean and well worth the price. comfortable beds (twins) and a big bathroom (which was a little chilly). Everything worked, everything was of a decent standard and it served as a great chill out spot. There was a TV (and if you are interested - BBC1 and 2 were there). In the morning the breakfast was very good - a buffet with cold meats, eggs and sausages - along with the juices, cereals, bread etc. The breakfast area is in a lovely old bar - great atmosphere. Getting to the hotel If you are fit it takes about 20 mins to walk to the hotel from the train station - and you'd want to walk if you can, because you get to see the chinese quarter, the red light district, a very beautiful canal, and several lovely bridges. Trams run straight from the station here (which we didn't use) so if you are less mobile you can use them to get to the hotel. Accessibility There are a couple of small steps at the front of the hotel, but once in, any disabled traveller would have no problems getting round - the ground floor is all one one level and the lifts are spacious enough to get a chair in. What we liked about the trip Highlights for our trip was the food (some very lovely places) as well as being the typical tourist and visiting Vondel park, the Van Gough museum, the red light district and the canal walks. Only one moan - why oh why in 2012 is wifi not included in the room, for free. You can use 30 mins in the reception for free, but really it should be standard in the room.

We booked through Expedia and as usual I consulted Trip Advisor and was almost put off by the many reviews saying it was impossible to sleep because of how noisy the street outside the hotel was. We arrived early Thursday morning and the first thing that happened was that the receptionist tried to send us to the sister hotel across the square, the NH Caransa. But we didn't book there, didn't want to go there (it's far more modern and concrete looking, although probably of similar quality) and I always find it far noisier on that side of the square anyway, with the clubs and trams running all night long. My partner insisted we stay where we had booked and we were told that we could, but we would have to wait until 3pm until a room was cleaned and available - he also requested a room at the back of the hotel for quietness. The staff were friendly, polite and helpful throughout our stay, and they took our luggage for us, tagged it and gave us receipts. We didn't have a problem with the extra time to kill as there is so much to do. We went back after 3am and found we had been given a room with a double bed instead of twin beds as we had booked, but it wasn't a problem for us (maybe it would be if friends were sharing instead). The room was lovely, spotlessly clean and quite large, room to walk about and sit (we had room 409), with big windows with blackout curtains right across and overlooking other houses - but a pleasant view, not like the usual backs of hotels where the only view is of metal air-con shafts! There were tea and coffee making facilities, a cool air fan if needed, a wall mounted TV with dozens of channels (including BBCs 1 and 2), a comfy chair and handy side table that you could pull in to yourself for eating, writing or reading, another chair at the desk and lots of bits and pieces - telephone, pen and paper, guide books, extra pillow, blanket, mini bar, fridge, safe etc. The bathroom was lovely, absolutely spotless and modern, a big bath with shower, basin, toilet and lovely clean white towels and complimentary soap, shower gel and shampoo replaced each day. There is also a magnifying mirror with a backlight, a hairdryer and shaving points. Only thing I didn't like was that the toilet tissue was those silly little squares that fall everywhere! But that was the only 'fault'. Now, the bed! The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, I wanted to keep it! The bed covers were pristine white, the pillows comfortable and the room was warm enough to not need more than a sheet (although there was a 'summer' duvet). I never heard a sound at all in all the time we were there, no banging doors, people or traffic and no clanky water pipes. No waking up with a bad back - in fact, I went there with a bad back and seriously, it got much better! I have one niggle and that is that the windows have a safety bar across outside to prevent people leaning too far out, but I dread the thought of children leaning out, as they could fall under the bar as it would be above them as it is high, so please be aware and keep the windows closed (the maid opens them sometimes to air the room). We didn't eat at all at the hotel (because we like to try different places), so I can't comment on the food quality, although I did notice that the menu was quite pricey! There is a huge art deco bar and a large lobby with newspapers available and a lovely quiet smaller room where you can sit in peace and watch the square, and directly in front of the window is the famous statue of Rembrandt. There is internet access available and free wifi, you have to ask for the code at the desk.

I have mixed feelings about this hotel. First the positives: 1) Location, location, location!! It is situated on a beautiful city square that leaves you within walking distance of many of the main attractions in Amsterdam - Anne Frank house (10-15 minute walk); Heineken tour (15 minute walk); Red light district (10-15 minute walk); the flower market (5 minute walk). Just bring your walking shoes and you can cover a lot of ground and sights out of this hotel - no need to even jump on the trams which are also conveniently located in the square. 2) They have a very good brasserie restaurant and a separate bar also attched to the hotel. 3) Hotel was booked a t a good price point considering it's central location. The negatives: 1) The hotel does not have air conditioning. This in itself is not an issue BUT if you are on the front side of the hotel (which is where the noise is) it could be problematic. I also noticed that the room did not have a thermostat SO I would imagine that in the winter you have very little control of the radiators in the room. 2) I asked for a \"quiet\" room and found myself on the 5th floor in a very small and dated room - carpeting looked like it had been in place for 50 years - not appealing at all. However - it was QUIET and I did get a good night's sleep. 3) requested a wake up call on both mornings of my stay and received NONE!! Thankfully I woke up on my own and was not late for either my meeting on the first day or my flight back home on the second day. This could have been disastrous!! Would I stay here again or recommend this hotel?

My room (121) was clean, modern and spacious- it made a good first impression apart from the rather poor view. Unfortunately I got an appalling nights sleep the first night as the club next door seemed to be piping their bass heavy techno music directly into my room. I'm not overly fussy with noise but this was at a level where my trusty ear plugs plus noise cancelling headphones combo was barely touching it. When I complained on the second night I got moved to a much smaller but much quieter room on the 5th floor. Again, I can't fault the service but I still struggle to imagine how anyone in that room could put up with it, unless they one of the people that were actually in the club (and from looking in the window I definitely wouldn't want to be one of those people).

If there is wireless available, why not let residents use it at their own discretion? )I had difficulty using the oucher to connect, but found the reception staff were very helpful. You can also ask for a free 15minute voucher to use on their own computer (one voucher for your stay). The tram stop is just opposite the hotel and this is very convenient. It was raining some of the time we were there (late February) and it was great to be able to 'pop' back to the hotel to our cosy room at intervals. A down-side if you like a late night drink or just want to chill out in the lounge, is that the bar/restaurant area (very nice art deco) closed its doors at around 10.30, but of course there is plenty activity outside the Rembrandtplein itself. This picked up at the weekend, and on the Saturday night we enjoyed the benefit of being at the back of the hotel as we heard the muffled sounds of entertainment late into the night (we did have our window open too).

Staff is very nice, but details are sometimes missed but I think these details get missed at most hotels in Amsterdam, e.g. they didn't call a taxi for me for an early morning departure as I'd requested, but I'd planned extra time in case this fell through knowing it was likely. I also thought the soap and shower gel were very poor quality and not effective at removing the grime and stink of days of sightseeing. There is a pillow menu, safe, hairdryer, hot water kettle and minibar. TV included about 3 BBC channels and much of the Dutch television was subtitled American programming. Although it is an older building, there is a lift. The free 15 mins of Internet daily was helpful for quick research and printing confirmations.

So when my girlfriend and I needed to spend an overnight in Amsterdam we made a booking at the NH Tropen. Arriving at the hotel we found it a little out of the way although in a beautifully green district, near the Tropical Gardens, Zoo and so on. We wanted however to be somewhere more central and to be able to explore historic Amsterdam on foot so the girl at Reception was very helpful and actually transferred our booking to another property, the NH Schiller on Rembrandtplein, at the same price and without any fee or surcharge! The Schiller is in an older building with a turn-of-the-century feel to the lobby (19th - 20th obviously, not 20th - 21st!). It gives on to a rectangular plaza with a statue of Rembrandt, tramlines, cafes, two more NH Hotels some restaurants and so on. Are you surprised at there being three NH hotels on one square? They have thirteen in Amsterdam and there's not really a lot of space to spread them around! Back to the neighbourhood, shops and restaurants and even cinemas abound in the lanes that lead from the square and 5 minutes to the south or east will find you strolling along the famous canals, looking into houseboats and trying not to get run over by strange half-bicycle-half-wheelbarrow contraptions. Our room was not particularly spacious but it was comfortable and spotless. As with quirky older buildings, sometimes the ensuite bathroom is actually larger than the actual bedroom which was almost the case here. Everything was clean and well cared for but pretty old. A nice touch were the little sweeties they'd placed on the pillows and the desk and a book of short stories actually compiled and published by the hotel chain, on the bedside table. To sum up, we were satisfied with our stay. We didn't try the breakfast as we had an early morning flight the next day but if up to the usual standards for this chain I'm sure it would have been perfectly acceptable. A little surprise was when we asked room-service for some ice and drinking glasses they said they would charge us if they had to bring it up but it was free if we went down to the restaurant and fetched it ourselves. And a word of warning if you get a room that actually faces on to the Rembrandtplein: there is a MASSIVE advertising LED display on the building opposite that is on all night and that the very heavy curtains only barely manage to block out.

Super easy to get to from the train station; trolly 4 or 9 will stop right across the plaza from the hotel. We got to museumplein and Dam Square easily using the trolleys and never had to transfer. There were lots of good restaurant choices on Utrechtsestraat, a street that lead off the plaza on the right as you exit the hotel. Cute little plaza, decorated with Christmas lights during our December stay and complete with Rembrandt statue and waffle stand. We didn't eat at the restaurant since it was a bit pricy and did not need internet service so I can't comment on these aspects. I reserved our room late and got a good price; I would probably be less enthusiastic at the regular plrice but it would still be a decent hotel choice given it's location and charm. We had a very nice two night stay at the Schiller and would probably stay there again if we return to Amsterdam.

We were on the first floor, facing the backyard, as this was supposed to be calm, but as our suite was directly above the kitchen there was a nice background noise from its air conditioning, but fortunately it was shut down before midnight. Our room did not have one, so I am grateful it was not too hot. There was also a house on the other side of the backyard that was being renovated, and the work (compressors, etc) started at 8:00am. Of course the hotel was not responsible for that inconvenience, but neither was there a small basket of fruit or anything else as an apology for being awakened so early during your holiday. It is true that the location is excellent, if you arrive by train the Tram No 4 or 9 will drop you on the Rembrandtplein, directly in front of the Hotel, and around are plenty of restaurants. I can only recommend Memories of India which serves the best Indian food that it was my pleasure to eat. Reception was cool, if you asked you got your information, but nothing else. As for breakfast I can but strongly recommend not to take it in the hotel as it is much too expensive for what they are offering. The buffet has all essentials, hot meat, cold fruit, yogurts, cereals, etc, but no luxury items like cold salm or exotic fruits. Personally I am a fan of french breakfast and their croissants and the bread are not exactly the same as their french cousins. Also for coffee, tea or hot chocolates you have to serve yourselves from a sophisticated machine, but as it happened twice in the 5 mornings that we were there, they forgot either to stock up the milk powder or the coffee. I also managed during those five mornings to eat their entire stock of those cute little Nutella pads. As I took only 3 each morning I have no great estimation for their stocking ability, nor do I think much of their surveillance of the buffet.

It was a convenient choice for us both. The easiest way to arrive from the airport is to take the train (tickets on sale in the airport luggage hall) and walk onto the platform five minutes away. We were in Central Station in 15 mins. Walk just outside and get on a no 4 or 9 tram (it's the terminus, so no worries about which direction to go!). Ask for the Rembrandtplein (square), about 5 mins away, and the hotel is immediately opposite. So, much cheaper - and quicker - than a taxi or the hotel shuttle bus, for which there were huge queues. The hotel is supposed to be an Amsterdam 'landmark' - over 100 years old. I was initially disappointed; the entrance and lobby are small and dark and looked a little worn. The lift is antiquated. But the staff couldnt have been more helpful. Having read Tripadvisor reviews I had asked for a quiet room at the rear,and this was the best piece of advice I got!! The noise at the front of the hotel must be awful at night and especially at weekends with all the bars and cafes in the square and the clanking trams! Butwe were upgraded to a more spacious business room at the rear which was comfortable and very quiet. The beds were extremely comfortable, bathroom small but perfectly adequate with masses of hot water; nice flatscreen TV Breakfasts in the Cafe Schiller were good - a range of hot and cold dishes, plenty of fruit, choice of lovely breads etc. You could even have sparking champagne if you wanted! And the cafe area was what actually 'grew on me'; it was quite nice to be in an older building with some character and charm instead of the usual modern hotel areas you find everywhere. The best thing was the convenience of being able to walk to every major sight in minutes. Turn left out of the hotel and left again and within two minutes you were on the quietest canals with their wonderful architecture. Two minutes in the other direction and you were in the heart of the city. We ate in some good restaurants - but the best by far was again two minutes away - down the road to the left of the hotel which leads to the canal. On the corner over the first bridge is a tiny Italian place - only about 8 tables - called Ponte Arcelo (or something like that!) run by two Italians.

It was a standard single bed for which I payed 502 Euros for 3 nights. I realize that this may seem high but it was actually quite fair considering the prices of many many other hotels I looked into.

The room was exceptionally clean with a flat screen lcd tv, mini bar, desk, and comfortable bed. I will say that I was there in October so the weather was quite moderate....this room didn't have any type of air conditioning so I would ask first in the summer before staying. I can't imagine the heat then. As for the restaurant and bar, the service was impeccable as was the food. If you have never had a Heineken in Amsterdam, you must try one. The waiter convinced me and I could not believe the difference of taste. As for the location, this area is very nice for anyone who wants to walk downtown Amsterdam. The city is fairly small and you can walk it in about 30 minutes from one side to the next(I am 38 and out of shape and done it).

NH Schiiler is right in Rembrantplein. Its literally in the square. You don't really get a sense of this when you visit the NH website and frankly, the website photo makes it look better than it is. So what does that mean for you? The good is that is a pretty major stop for the trams which are great public transportation in the city. Its also pretty centrally located. About a 20 min walk to Central Station, 20 mins to Leidesplein and Museumplein, very close to Spui. Bad news, there are tons of restaurants, neon lights and a huge TV screen. Think a small New York Times Square. So its bright and noisy. If you are a light sleeper, beware. It was pretty noisy. Our room faced the main square. The are restaurants all around but the neon lights are across the square, separated by a small park so that does reduce some of the brightness. Inside, its an interesting mix. The hotel exterior and lobby is very old. Quaint? Its style is early-mid 20th century but a bit rundown looking to me. They are in the process of remodeling but I am unsure of what parts they will change. The rooms themselves were very new and modern and all the NH hotels seem to have a similar decor. They are a pretty good size, especially for european rooms. Only issue was the bathroom but I'll get to that later. The TVs are flat screens. The room has a built in safe for valuables. There is a nice reading chair by the window to relax in. The only negative was the bathroom. First, the bathroom door opens up right by the bed. Its one of those rooms where you enter the bath, straight from the bedroom. The bath was older and cramped. The shower was the worst part. The shower is a bit old and the tiles had some stains. The problem was the shower curtain was a flimsy and didn't reach the bottom. The water would leak and flood the floor all the time. We only stayed here 2 days and moved across the street to the NH Caransa. It wasn't because of the room, we just booked it that way because of availability but it ended up as a better situation. The staff was very friendly and gave my daughter a kid's kit of puzzles and art supplies. Our room fee was still pretty expensive but that is also largely due to the exchange rate these days which is pretty terrible for US travelers.

Occasional trams rumbling by which I found quite comforting. Windows didn't fit too well and quite a draft through - temps very low whilst we were there but this was our only gripe. We ate in the hotel the first night which was a bit of a treat as quite expensive. We ordered a bottle of house white and was asked to taste another wine to see what we thought. It was lovely but double the price - they sold it to us for the same price as the house white! Beautiful paintings all over the hotel by Mr Schiller. Worth a good look, they are everywhere, look above you! A beautiful painting above and opposite the lift in the lobby. Hotel in good central position. You can walk everywhere from here and will miss so much if you are lazy and take the tram! This was my second visit to Amsterdam. It was just as vibrant and diverse as I remembered it.", "Date": "March 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cornwall, England", "Title": "\u201cJust perfect\u201d", "Author": "Coxei", "ReviewID": "UR4595182", "Content": "Just returned home from a lovely stay at the NH Schiller. We booked this room in November and had a 'buy two nights get one free deal' including breakfast, so had 3 nights Sa/Sun/Mon for less than \u00c2\u00a3200. I has requested a non smoking, quiet room and this is just what we had, with a king size bed, two armchairs and a desk, a choice of pillows, chocolate on your pillow each day, tea/ coffee, toiletries in a spotlessly clean bathroom etc, and although we didn't use the mini bar, we did use the fridge. There was an ice machine on our floor (previous review said they would have liked one)and a canned drinks machine. The staff at reception were more than helpful, giving us a map, showing us where to go and also looking after our luggage on our last day as we had a early evening flight. The bar was no more expensive than anywhere else we visited for drinks, and the breakfast was fine, lots of breads, jams, meats, cheeses, fresh fruit salad, fresh fruit, salad, yoghurts, cereals, juices, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and good coffee, all help yourself. It was snowing whilst we were there, but the rooms were very warm. We couldn't fault it.

The NH Schiller was the perfect choice. The location is perfect. Just a 10 min or so walk to Dam Square and the Red Light District, and right out the door in Rembrandt square you can find just about anything for dining and entertainment. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was nice, very clean and the bathroom was spotless. The only minor problem was the location of the room, we were in room 120 and it is right near a bar which made it a bit noisy at night. Luckily we're late night people so it didnt bother us too much. I would definatley stay at the Schiller again and recommend it to anyone going to Amsterdam. One small tip. If you're from the US and plan on changing money at an exchange center, we found out that most places will not accept $100 bills with a serial date from 2001. Apparently there were a number of counterfiet bills during that year, so most won't take them. Luckily we had enough not to worry, but did find a Western Union near the hotel that took them without question.", "Date": "February 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel and Service\u201d", "Author": "enemy01", "ReviewID": "UR4350548", "Content": "The Schiller hotel was just what we were looking for from a short break in Amsterdam. The hotel is located right on Rembrandt Square, close to lots of clubs, restaurants and coffee shops if that is what you want. The tram stops on the other side of Rembrandt Square and makes it easy to get around Amsterdam. Our rooms were at the rear of the hotel, so we had no problems with noise at night, although I think the front rooms may have been more noisy, but that is what you would expect if you want to be close to all the restaurants and bars. The hotel is very attractive with its art deco history. The rooms were very clean and the bathrooms were great. In house movies were good too for a fee. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant so I can't comment on that, but from the menu it seemed interesting if a little expensive. I would recommend staying in this hotel if you do not have children, I don't think I saw more than a few children staying here.
