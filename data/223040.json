We loved Miami Beach much more than Miami itself!! So much livelier! A lot of this had to do with the location of this hotel. The hotel is in the Financial District so the streets were bare every time we were on them as there is no retail etc just offices in this area. There was a nice little intersection with some nice restaurants on it a quick walk away but other than that we felt like we were an awkward distance from things. Too close to take a cab but just far enough that it was a long walk. This is solved by the free metro line the hotel is very close to which can get you out of the area....but its never nice to stay in an area you cant wait to get out of all day and night. The room: The rooms were ok. Nothing special. Bed was veery comfy but the room was muggy and very average. We had a lot of problems exchanging money in Miami since our hotel was not only not near anything that could help us with this typical tourist practice (odd since it's in the financial district), but also because the staff could not and would not try to name a place we could cab/walk to do this. In contrast, we went by the Holiday Inn on Bayside across from the market to ask them where a money exchange place was nearby since they were the closest hotel to us at that moment and we thought they might know how to answer this touristy question (I always pop into nearby hotels when I am out of town if I have questions about the city as the day goes on since they are in the tourism business so always know the answers and are always ready to court new guests). The cheaper Holiday Inn helped us despite us not being guests and pointed us to the nearby Western Union (Miami tip: exchange all of your money before going it was a real headache exchanging it there for some reason). All in all, the much less prestigious Holiday Inn seemed to be just as clean and comfortable with better service and a much better location for tourism (by the Arena, Bayside Marketplace, and the bridge to Miami Beach) and I imagine it would have cost a lot less... This hotel is well suited for business trips but not worth the price or travel time for a tourism trip. Maybe if it were super nice it would make it worth the poor location but alas it is not...it is average.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cQuality hotel....\u201d", "Author": "AlexanderDelarge", "ReviewID": "UR125547672", "Content": "I enjoyed my recent stay in the JW Marriott Miami.

The refrigerator was set up like a vending machine, so there was no room to put anything else. We did not get to go to any of the restaurants or lounges in the hotel, because we wanted to explore the city.

I was told to stay here along with a few other co-workers for 2 reasons...1) it's less than a mile from the office I'd be working out of, and 2) you've got to see these TV's they have built into the bathroom mirrors! Well, the rooms are very nice. Very big and roomy. While I couldn't get a view toward the water, I was given an end room with two walls of windows...very nice view of the downtown area beyond Brickell Avenue. So after checking in, I went to the bathroom to check out the novelty of a TV in the mirror. To me, it looked like a mirror. I asked someone at the front desk when I was there, and they told me that if you weren't in a suite, you had to be on the 19th floor or above (I was on 17) or in a suite to have the TVs in the mirror. A fellow coworker, who was on 19, was told you had to nbe on 21 or above. I was kind of bummed, but I'm not sure how you'd watch TV in the bathroom anyway...certainly not while using the toilet, which was on the same wall and separated by a partition. The room is comfortable. The flat screen in the main room is very nice...would've been better if they offered HD, but I don't know if anyone does that. The large desk chair was nice as well. While they do offer free wireless service, it was very unreliable...slow, failed to connect regularly, unsecure, and overall, worth about as much as it costs. Now, for $10/day, you can have secure wired service. The 'tech' maintenance guy wasn't much help in diagnosing what was wrong with the connection. The scene they set for you in the room (i.e., curtains all open, some type of classy music playing on the CD player in the room, etc.,) is a nice touch. Towels were clean, soft, thick, and big...best I can remember at a hotel. I always wondered why hotels don't use some form of fabric softener. If you can pick what type of pillow you want, why can't you pick whether your linens have been washed with a fabric softener. Anyway, these were really soft. One irk...I don't mind housekeeping coming in and straightening up every day; however, when they get anal to the point where they have to move your stuff in order to get the room to look exactly the same as it did when you check in, that really bugs me. If I move the yucky hair dryer (that I don't need) bag away from the hook on the back of the bathroom door b/c I need that hook for my hanging bathroom bag, I don't need the hairdryer back on the hook (on top of my stuff) the next day. And I definitely don't need all of my bathroom items pushed to the sides of the bathroom counter so they little bottle of this and that can be put back where they're supposed to be...like I said, just a little irk...but after fighting with these and many other types of things...and literally having to put the room back the way I want it each day for a few days in a row. I finally just started hanging the sign on the door each day so I wouldn't have to mess with it anymore. You're only a few blocks from the water, and within walking distance of around 20 restaurants, bars, nightclubs, etc. The concierge keeps a handly list of eateries in the area.

I wish that I could have stayed a day or two longer! Service at the JW was excellent! Every single hotel associate went out of their way to offer a pleasant greeting. The hotel seemed very friendly. Checking in, I received room #2212, which is on the 22nd floor, also designated the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Presidential Floor.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Getting off of the elevator there is a round presidential seal on the wall and both the Presidential and Vice-Presidential suites are on this floor. My room reservation was made by a colleague and I received a room with two queen-size beds instead of a king, but it was fine with me. The room was very comfortable in every respect. The air conditioning was quiet and effective and did not blow directly on me when in bed or working at the desk. Lighting in the room was good. One of the features I liked best about my room was the espresso machine. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if all the rooms have espresso machines, but it was a treat for me. I made decaf the evening I arrived and used up the four packs of regular the next morning. The desk had a PC on it, but I travel with my laptop so I did not use it.

My room had a very large flat screen TV mounted to the wall. Only standard definition programming was available. The bathroom was very nice, with a glassed-in combination tub and shower. This was the first JW Marriott that I have stayed in where there was not a separate shower. The bath amenities seemed to be high quality. The towels were thick and very absorbent. Lighting was OK for me, but my wife would probably have said it was not bright enough. There was a TV in the bathroom, but it showed through the mirror so it was very dim, especially when the both lights were on. Water pressure was high and hot water flowed immediately. There was a large leather arm chair between one of the beds and windows. It was very comfortable. There being no ottoman, I used the edge of the bed. Because the room had two queen-size beds, there was not room for an ottoman or a coffee table. My room, #2212 faced east and had a partial view of Biscayne Bay and Miami Beach in the distance. I say partial, because there were several tall buildings between the hotel and bay. However, the view was good from my 22nd floor room. The one queen-size bed that I used was very comfortable. The bedding was high quality and the pillows smelled fresh. On the night stand between the two beds was a combination CD player and clock radio. I tried for about five minutes to figure out how to set the alarm, but finally gave up and asked for a wake-up call. The wake-up call was by a person, not a machine. The only place near the beds to plug my cell phone charger in was behind the night stand, a minor inconvenience. My colleague and I arrived just before the concierge lounge closed, but were in time for desert. There were several selections including individual chocolate cake that must likely boasted over 1,000 calories. It was very good! The buffet breakfast in the lounge offered scrambled eggs and bacon as well as a wide assortment of fruit, breads, and juices. The coffee was excellent and the concierge even offered to brew espresso for guests. I visited the spa, but only to take a few photos of the exercise room. The exercise room overlooks the outdoor swimming pool. The equipment looked very new. Exercise towels and water were set out. The treadmills and stationary bikes faced windows that looked out onto the pool area. There was an adjoining room with weight equipment and free weights. The outdoor pool was deserted when I looked, but it looked inviting. We used valet parking and calling down before I left my room; the rental car was waiting for us.

First impressions not good - pulling up in the car, I learn that it is valet parking only at $27 per night - that's getting close to how much it cost to rent the car per day. As it was a Saturday night, there were loads of white clad valet parkers standing around - that just makes me hassled. I want to park my own car, get the stuff I need and take my time. I asked about alternative local public parking, but none of the white clad gentlemen understood the term \"public parking\" - it took four guys to consult before they knew what I was talking about. That ain't Five Star hotel service either. The hotel is in Downtown which looks pretty dead at the weekend and it is sorrounded by much taller apartment blocks and offices From my SW facing corner room there is a very small glimpse of the sea.. The room feels small compared to the Singapore Fairmont that I just got back from.Now that is a proper Five Star hotel and is the benchmark I am using to rate this place. Furniture is quite tired looking, big lumps of brown wood placed so as to block access to the window blinds and electrical sockets. Closing the blinds at night is a real pain and I tripped over a stupidly placed magazine rack which has seen better days and looks like plenty of other people have tripped over it too. There is no central control of lighting, so hitting the bed and leaving the light on means you have to get up again. Don't come to this hotel if you want to stay in touch with international TV news channels - no BBC World? But loads of the usual religious channels in the morning and those selling channels. Perhaps the line up will improve as the working week begins. Wireless access works well here on the 17th floor and is free. There is a mini Wyse \"Winterm\" on the desktop but I have not used it. It has two USB ports but not sure if you could plug a card reader or other USB peripherals into it. There is also wired internet access but it costs $9.99 per day. A strange pricing structure - if you don't have wireless on your laptop you are in trouble. The hotel seems to be participating in this foolish \"pillow arms race\", there are seven pillows on my bed at present - which is ridiculous. Someone need to let them know loads of pillows does not a \"Five Star hotel make\". Other room amenities - mini bar fridge with minimal space to put your own stuff - just squeezed a one pint bottle of fresh milk and some chocolate in. Coffee maker in a drawer but only plastic cups supplied - that definitely downrates this place. There are wine glasses and tumblers for drinks but plastic cups for tea or coffee. A quick call to housekeeping did sort that one out. Large wall mounted LCD TV but positioned badly for watching if you are sitting working at desk in room. At the desk in the room, there is only one power outlet built into the lamp. Another is hidden behind the desk and is both a stretch and not practical to plug in many AC adapters. My tip, always bring a multi-way socket outlet for these situations. Breakfast was in another tired looking room - a poor selection - they passed my porride and bacon test - both available and tasty, but croissants poor, orange juice had to be requested - not available on buffet (a first for me). Room seemed lifeless - no buzz even if it was a Sunday morning. Overall, the US seems to do budget hotels really well, I have virtually always been satisfied with a range of hotels from a really cheap Knight's Inn in Pennsylvania through excellent Holiday Inn Expresses and recently a Candlewood Suites even Marriott Courtyards, but proper Five Star service seems to be sub-standard when compared with the best European or Asian hotels.", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay at the JW Marriott\u201d", "Author": "KimCT", "ReviewID": "UR29147139", "Content": "We had a late flight and arrived at the Hotel close to midnight.

The place was a ghost town, and I can't figure out how it could have been sold out. The lobby and bar area were completely empty. They put us on the 10th floor overlooking the pool, which was not a big deal, though we would have preferred a view. The hallway leading to our room smelled old and musty, and the carpet was ancient. Our room was a standard king, nothing special aside from the flat screen in the wall and the computer. The Wi-fi (which was free) was slow at best. It was pointless to even try to connect to my laptop wirelessly, and had to use the DSL cable. The tv volume control was set not to turn up any louder than \"15\" on the control. our alarm clock woke us at 7 am, though we didn't set it. The wall paper was peeling off the bathroom wall. The bed was hard, and not as plush as other JW's or even Marriott's. The guest room carpeting was old, stained and I didn't want to walk on it without my shoes! I called the front desk at 11pm and told them we would be checking out in the morning and not staying 2 nights as planned. They did not ask why. Upon checkout, I told the clerk of the above issues, and he simply said he was sorry I felt that way. We're Marriott Reward members and often stay with Marriott, but this was nothing special.

Top-of-the-line amenities (soap, lotion, mouthwash, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel); free bottled water and coffee/tea service; 42\" plasma wall-mounted TV; FREE internet in the room; awesome views of the city; comfy but firm bed with crisp white smooth linens and lots of pillows; great room service ... really very pleasant stay!

Very convenient, FREE, and lots of bang for the buck (LOL! shopping queen here). Right next door to Gordon Biersch which was very nice to have a variety of cold beers and then be able to walk back across the street to the JW Marriott. Also across the street from Morton's Steakhouse, if that's what you're into (I'm not, since I'd much rather BBQ my own ranch-raised steers than pay for their overpriced a la carte steak dinners). Last, I do have one suggestion for the JW Marriott folks ... you are missing a TREMENDOUS opportunity for some really great PR with those silly newspaper holders...you know the ones that hang over the door, with your hotel name on the front, and a little strip of fabric holding the newspaper inside. Well, spend a few more cents and make it a bag with a solid bottom, and I'll bet folks will take them home/traveling with them to tote items around. What a great way to get publicity and get your name throughout the airports, with very little cost or modification of what you're doing now.

I did a LOT of research before choosing a pre-cruise hotel in Miami. The location of the Bayside Marketplace Intercontinental was VERY appealing, but many of the recent reviews on that hotel have been disappointing. The main Miami Hyatt also didn't have great press. In the end, I narrowed the choice down to the JW Marriott or the Mandarin Oriental. The consistently good reviews and the price led me to choose the JW Marriott - we weren't to be disappointed. We were flying in from the UK (connecting in Orlando). Our flight into Miami was delayed and we eventually arrived at the hotel, by taxi, quite late (about 10.30pm). We were checked in very quickly and efficiently - the staff were friendly too. I was very impressed with the room: very tastefully furnished, very clean, lovely bed and linens, very nice large flat screen TV mounted on the wall, well appointed spotless luxurious bathroom. The room was also very quiet: didn't hear any noise from Brickell Avenue or from the corridor. It was a perfect short stay hotel room. The whole hotel was very modern, sophisticated, tasteful and spotlessly clean. I was surprised how quiet the hotel seemed to be - maybe because we stayed on a Friday night: I assume that the hotel is probably a lot busier, with business people, during week nights. It was getting late, but - because our body clocks were so confused - we popped down to the casual bar/restaurant for a quick bite to eat. I had a shrimp caesar salad, husband had a burger - food arrived quickly and both were good. Service was a little \"laid back\", but there weren't many customers and we didn't have any trouble getting the attention of the servers when we wanted something. There was what is supposedly a very nice restaurant next to the JW Marriott - the Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant. Also a Morton's across the road from the hotel. We didn't have time to try either unfortunately. The bed was excellent and I slept like a princess... I used the gym the next morning - I THINK that it may be 24 hour, but am not sure. I was there by 6.15am and didn't see any other guests there (just one cleaner) - I left at about 7.30am. Cardio machines are pretty good and there are TVs there that you can plug headphones into. I thought that the resistance machines were few and very disappointing. There were plenty of complimentary bottles of water available in the gym (also some in the room and some in reception) - a nice touch. I am probably spoilt by having such a good gym at home, but I thought that the JW Marriott gym was perfectly acceptable. We didn't use the swimming pool, but it looked nice: pretty small, but nice for a quick dip. We had breakfast in the main hotel restaurant - a HUGE selection: what looked like a very good buffet, plus a good a la carte choice too. It was fairly pricey, but for a treat (or if you are on an expense account) it is fine. Good food and good service - very enjoyable. Check-out was as efficient and friendly as check-in. One of the doormen hailed a taxi for us and it was a short taxi ride (about 15 minutes and about $25) to the Port of Miami. Was very satisfied with our stay - this hotel is spot on for short pre-cruise stays or business trips. If you are looking for a \"resort\" hotel or a bustling family-oriented hotel, then look elsewhere.

She obviously didn't know where she was or possibly if she should be in a horizontal position. Housekeeping is another deal. They snoop through hotel guests garbage. The hotel is non-smoking and housekeeping found a wrapped up cigarette butt in my garbage so they ran to brown nose Mr. or Ms. Big Shot. Before I know it I have a Smoke Recovery letter in my room with a $250 charge. I went to one of the many managers and she took it off my bill. She told me that they check with housekeeping and asked if she smelled smoke. Housekeeping said \"No\". Of course not, I didn't smoke in the room. A week before arrival I made a spa reservation for a body wrap and message. The girl, who did more giggling than talking called me about 4 times to get my credit card number, to confirm my 9:30 appointment, to change my time to 8:30, and to giggle. When I went to the spa, they were going to give me a body wax not body wrap. The woman said \"The Chinese girl doesn't speak English well\". So I ended up getting back to back messages because the woman told me I was going to be charged anyway. My husband was accused of stealing by a valet person. We parked our car in valet every night. My daughter and son-in-law pulled their car into valet, and we had lunch. When it was time for them to take their car out, my husband gave the valet $10 (the cost was $9). The valet guy came back and gave $11 in change to my son-in-law. My husband said he gave the valet guy $10 not $20. All of a sudden, the valet guy started screaming at my husband for stealing money. The cashier girl came out and was confused. But my husband is honest. They didn't even apologize. Additionally, we were never told that if visitors eat in any of their restaurants, there is no charge for parking. My daughter and son-in-law ate with us at the hotel 2 times.

The beds are uncomfortable, oh and bring a scrub brush and soap so you can clean the bathroom. They install a tv in the bathroom hoping you will be distracted and not see the dirt. Ask for towels, otherwise you'll end up using a washcloth or if you're lucky 2 washcloths to dry yourself off after a shower.

The stay was reserved on the Marriott website using Marriott Reward points. This was a very last minute trip (booked on Thursday for Saturday night), so we were willing to consider all Marriott properties in and around downtown Miami or South Beach. This was the property that had availability. By the way, in late January rooms were available starting at over $400 a night. Our stay included the buffet breakfast on Sunday morning and my husband said it was really quite nice. The property is located on Brickell Ave., in the midst of many high rises - both condos and office buildings. I had printed directions to the hotel off of Mapquest and I'm glad I did as it wasn't readily apparent where the entrance to the hotel was. Parking was $27 per night (or $9 per hour - you do the math) and it appeared to us that it was valet only. Valet staff was courteous and quite efficient. The check-in was pretty efficient and the hotel had an accurate record of the points being used for our reservation. The hotel lobby is very spacious and filled with beautiful seating areas. Lots of dark wood and gleaming brass, marble floors. Our room was on the 17th floor, looking out over the city of Miami (which appears to be a city of cranes and partially constructed high rise condos and offices). The room was reasonably large, very light and airy. It had very nice furniture with the lovely new Marriott bedding. Desk with chair (and a computer and keyboard, though we had our own laptop), easy chair, chest with minibar and drawers under a flat screen TV. Bottled water was provided for no charge. The bathroom seemed a bit on the small side, with only a single sink and a combo shower/tub. Plentiful and good quality towels and the type of shower curtain that bows out to give you the feel of more space in the shower. Generous toiletries - be aware that the hairdryer is stored in the closet outside the bathroom. The one odd thing about the bathroom was the \"open\" toilet - no closing lid, which I found a bit disconcerting when brushing my teeth at the nearby sink. We were at the hotel such a short time that we didn't have time to use any of their facilities such as the gym or the pool. We did have pre-dinner drinks in Drake's Bar and it was a quiet, very clubby bar in which to wait for family to gather. The single bartender had our table of 6 and another couple to wait on, but seemed to disappear just when we needed something. She was however, very nice and very attentive when she was around. We were able to walk to dinner at a nearby Italian restaurant, though we did notice that there was almost nothing (store, restaurant, bars, etc.) open within the area of the hotel on the weekend. I would assume there would be more during the weekdays, but the area appeared to be virtually deserted on a Saturday. The hotel is not near the beaches or the activity of South Beach or Coconut Grove. This made me think of this more as a business hotel, rather than a place to take the family for a vacation. Lunch on the day of our departure was a bit disappointing, as we ate at the La Terraza Cafe in the hotel and experienced indifferent, extremely slow service. It wasn't busy, so we were a bit puzzled by the inattentiveness of the wait staff. All in all, the JW Marriott Miami served our purpose - a (relatively) free stay on short notice for one night to visit family. For a business hotel, I would say good choice. For a family vacation or to really experience Miami, head out to the water and the beaches. For the rates they charge during our \"season\", I'd consider other options.", "Date": "February 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cIt was fine- Wouldn't be my first choice\u201d", "Author": "meglu", "ReviewID": "UR6634809", "Content": "Pool was small, no view to speak of, often shaded from buildings close by.

I checked in on Wednesday March 1st for a 2 night stay. I arrived at the airport at 10:30 PM and immediately called the hotel to let them know I was coming. I told them I wanted to order room service before I got there so it would be ready for me when I arrived. The lady on the phone put me on hold and said she had to confirm if I could order from the dinner menu at 11:00 PM. I was on hold for 7 minutes and she never came back to the phone. I called a few more times and she did the same thing so finally I spoke to a night manager named Florencia (Best person who works there) and she took my order. That was just the beginning of the horror show I experienced there: After I checked in I was put in room 2123 on the concierge floor. The room had numerous maintenance problems 1)TV volume control did not work 2)Air conditioner made strange noise 3)Curtain was falling off I got to know the engineer very well on this trip. The next day I spoke with the General Manager(also named Florencia) and I told her what happened. She didn't offer me anything off the room and tried to say she would upgrade me to a suite for $299.00 the next night. I couldn't believe it and after 30 minutes of arguing with her she agreed to comp the previous night. I mean, the whole discussion was ridiculous!!! Anyways, I literally got no sleep the night before so after viewing my new room I proceeded to fall asleep in my original room (I was dead tired!!!) I got a phone call at 4:00 PM from the front desk manager who told me I had to move now because the hotel was sold out but I could not even move I was soooo tired. I told him I'll just stay in the original room because I was very tired and he said okay. Well, when I got up I went to eat out and came back around 11:30 PM to my room. This time line 1 on the phone didn't work and up came the engineer who tried for an hour to fix the phone with no luck. I woke up at around 4:00 AM and was a little hungry so I called room service to get some cereal and milk. Here's the kicker - I can't drink 2% or whole milk because I have stomach problems so I told the order taker I would like skim milk (I said it 3 times). So what do you think the waiter brings up to my room???? 2% milk of course. The kicker is that he tried to tell me for 5 minutes that the milk he brought was skim and I ALMOST believed him until I looked at it ultra carefully and determined it was 2%. When I finally screamed to him it was not SKIM milk, he said \"Oh, skim milk is not the same as 2% ???\" I just looked at him and shook my head in disgust. That summed up my stay at this horrible excuse for a Marriott!!!! Bottom Line is this: if anyone decides to stay there, they need to be aware that most of the staff don't speak good english, they have 1 \"at your service\" button that handles all the departments and if you ask for let's say, the front desk extension, they'll never give it to you!!!! Lastly, the general manager of the property, Florencia (I forget her last name) is the worst GENERAL MANAGER I have ever seen. I tried asking for her boss's name and she would not tell me all \"call the corporate office\" she kept saying. I fially found out that a gentleman named Mr. Glass owns the hotel and I tried to reach him unsuccessfully. Sorry for the long review but everyone needs to know what I experienced at this horrible hotel.

It doesn't matter if you are wearing shorts or a tuxedo, you are given nothing but the best. The room faced the pool area and was quite nice with the plasma screen tv, internet access, marble bathroom,and pillow top beds. I love to work out at the fitness area because it was like a real gym!! Not only were there plentiful machines, but LCD television screens at almost each machine!!The fitness room had a large 42 inch plasma when you walk in, if you prefer just to relax and read a newspaper or magazine, cranberry juice, apples, pears, and lots of bottled water and towels ...like being in \"fitness heaven\". There isn't much nite life because it is in the financial district of town, and not many restauarants open late in the evening. We did find an Italian restuarant called Ludo''s that offered great pizza and tasty pasta.

It was a great treat to have excellent food and drinks brought to your chaise lounge. The pool is heated so even if the breeze is a little cool, you can have a comfortable swim.

One great touch is free internet access via a computer terminal in your room. I loved this - - very easy and convenient to check e-mail and get info off the net. Room service was very good too. I had access to the concierge lounge which had a great breakfast buffet. Overall the service was excellent. The staff are very polite, prompt, and professional. While there is not a lot to do in the immediate area around the hotel, as mentioned in a previous review, this hotel is only about 10 or 15 minutes from South Beach. We took Highway 1 North to the Venetian Causeway (turn right on 15th St I think - - near the Omni?). It's a very easy drive and we never encountered much traffic. One other thing, this hotel is also very close to Key Biscayne and the beaches there - - also a 10 - 15 minute drive and very little traffic. I did not have lunch or dinner in the restaurants so I can't evaluate them. We got a great rate of $169.00 on Marriott. For this price, this hotel was a steal.
