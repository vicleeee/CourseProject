We reserved and pre-paid for a high floor golf course/pool view room. This hotel has 6 floors. When we checked in at 3p, not only were there no high floor rooms in our room type available, there were no rooms ready at all in our room type. We we're told the 3rd floor was the best they can do or we can have a parking lot view higher up. No apology....just very matter of fact take it or leave it attitude. I reminded them of my pre-paid rate that I booked on their website and was told that this sometimes happens....again no attempt to apologize. If anything, he seemed bothered I was asking at all. We chose the 3rd floor room as we really wanted the golf course/pool view. We then were told that they were still cleaning our room and to take a seat in the lobby for about 20 min. We were also told we would be advised right away once the room was ready. Thirty minutes later, I went back to see the status of the room. He said that it's been ready for a while and gave me the key with no apology for having us just sit there. I then asked him when a higher floor room would be available. He said that tommorrow, some higher floor rooms would open up and to speak to the front desk in the morning. In the meantime our 3rd floor room balcony overlooked an overhang that goes out to the pool. The top of the overhang was littered with trash. The next morning, I went back to the front desk and spoke to a manager, who advised me that the guy the night before never should have told us there were higher floor rooms available the next day as this was not true. He said we'd have to wait until tomorrow. We were only there 4 nights, and 2 of them were in a room type we didn't want and hadn't pre-paid for. Again, the manager was very apathetic and acted like I was irritating him. Furthermor, there was no offer made to refund the rate difference or compensate us in any way. Half way through the trip, they did indeed find us a higher floor room (6th floor) and moved our stuff for us (after we had packed it all up). That was greatly appreciated and made all the difference in the world! The hotel itself is very nice! The suites were clean and comfortable with excellent housekeeping services. The breakfast was ample and pretty good....especially the made to order omlettes. The evening manager reception was great. It's basically an open bar from 5:30p - 7:30p. As other people have said, the snacks are nothing to write home about, but certainly fine. The pool and hot tub area was nice, but the pool itself is not well taken care of. There was a brown film around the inside edge of the pool from the waterline up. It's obviously not cleaned regularly and kind of gross. The views from this side of the property are wonderful. The golf course driving range is literally 50 feet from the pool deck. Beyond that are beautiful hills and mountains to enjoy all day long. The hotel is very close to the Paradise Valley Mall and there a lot of nearby restaurants. Would we stay here again? You bet we would, but we'd go in knowing not to expect much from the front desk folks and that we may or may not get the room we reserved. I see that a manager writes responses to these reviews. I certainly hope he/she is noticing the trend in most of these reviews......nice hotel....lousy front desk service.

We had a beautiful room but it overlooked the parking lot..ASK to look over the golf course. Our hotel was booked solid as it was spring training in Phoenix. Also, the maid service was not up to par..one day they didn't service our room and when we called at 5pm everyone had gone home for the day. They sent someone up for \"light\" housekeeping..but they didn't even make the bed! NEVER have I had a hotel bed not made everyday. When we called, they took care of it.

We paid for an upgraded room facing the golf course and were told none was available. Upon further searching, the front desk clerk was able to find a room for us. It faced the clubhouse, but that wasn't a problem, although you can hear the loudspeaker and there was a wedding on Saturday evening. The strong positives for us: comfortable suite hotel in a good location for touring around Phoenix and Scottsdale with full made to order breakfast. And, the hotel is about 20 minutes from the airport. The room was fine; very clean and the bed was comfortable. The view of the golf course is lovely. We didn't have time to hang out on the property so I can't comment on the pool, etc. but the common areas were clean and comfortable. Used the business center to print out boarding passes; the center was clean, had office supplies and the printers worked well. Breakfast was GREAT; made to order eggs and efficiently done. The cooks were so nice and friendly. The dining room has nice views of the golf course. Took advantage of the cocktail hour once--bartender's were also friendly and welcoming.

Our stay was Thursday-Monday. I am a Hilton honors Gold member traveling with my husband. I used points for our stay and had reserved a mountain/golfcourse view room. Upon check-in, I was assigned a room overlooking the street and was told there were no other rooms available. I found that hard to believe because the parking lot wasn't too crowded. After much discussion, the front desk clerk finally found another room with the view I had requested. I didn't really expect to be hassled like this. We had just flown across the country and were tired. Anyway, we finally got into our room and all was better. The room was typical 2-room suite. We were in room #6013 and has a great view from both the bedroom and the patio. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was nicely redone. The sofa was frayed and sagging and needed to be replaced. As said in a previous review, the furniture in the lobby and throughout the hotel needs to be updated. The hotel was a very nice experience on Thursday and Sunday and the weekend was another story. Several large groups took over the hotel on Saturday. The pool area is very small and they had half of the area. They were wheeling in coolers and carrying in 12 packs of beer and being rather loud. Finally, management came out and told them they can't have their coolers and their own beer. I wish they would've come sooner because it was hard to enjoy a beautiful Saturday afternoon at the pool with all the chaos going on in such a small area. The area is nice around the hotel, not as nice as Scottsdale, but many different choices of restaurants nearby. We enjoyed walking the trails through the neighborhoods. The business center was usually available but the printer needed servicing. We had to ask the front desk to print our boarding passes as you could not read them from the printer in the business center.

Do based upon recommendations we gave it a try knowing we could always move if we had too. We ended up staying there all 3 nites. It's situated on a golf course (ask for a room overlooking that). It was quiet and relaxing. Breakfast is pretty amazing considering it comes free with the room with cooked to order omelets too! There was a business group there having a function, there were families w kids- all blended well. The staff was discreet & helpful. Our room, the public areas, even the laundry room are immaculate. All this for $101.00/nite w our AAA discount. We were so pleased w every detail. Did I mention location? There is a Whole Foods around the corner, a fabulous mall the opposite direction, and a terrific local neighborhood restaurant named Floyds on N.Tatum, also around the corner.

We chose this hotel because the conference was located here and we did not want to rent a car and drive each day to the conference. However, if you choose to rent a car, parking is free. The hotel is located a 20 minute drive north of Sky Harbor Phoenix airport. Taxis run about $35 one way. You can also use the Desert Coach service, which is a $40 flat rate one way. Super Shuttle is another option for $19 one way, but it's a shared service and you might end up going to other hotels first before reaching your destination (your hotel or the airport), which might mean that transportation time will be longer than 20 minutes. The hotel recommends Desert Coach service because they are the most reliable, according to the hotel. The front desk will call Desert Coach to arrange transportation for you, but if you want to take a taxi or the Super Shuttle, the front desk will give you phone numbers for you to call. Two of the front desk members said that taxis might not arrive on time and be reliable, but I called the taxi myself the night before and the taxi was there, right on time. The hotel is located in Paradise Valley, and I do not know Phoenix well, but this area seems nice. Paradise Valley Parkway is a loop, and in the center is an indoor mall, as well as a Target and REI. It is easy to walk to Paradise Valley Mall, and it took us about 15 minutes to walk to some of the restaurants on the outskirts of the mall, which is great because we did not have a a car. The hotel lobby is clean and modern with a large lounge area. Check-in and check-out was efficient. I noticed 2 elevators, but since my room was on the second floor, I chose to take the stairs every day except for moving luggage. The stairs are located at the end of the hallways, and sometimes, they will lock you out. Someone had left a towel stuffed in the doorway to prevent that from happening. Our room overlooked the front entrance of the hotel. The hotel is located in a residential area that is quiet, so there are not clubs or bars or restaurants unless you walk towards the main road. The hotel has its own golf course that is shared with condominiums that also overlook the golf course. The view is fabulous from the lobby because you walk into the pool area and then you seen the golf course that is green with a beautiful backdrop of mountains. The pool is nice, not designed for lap swimming, but fun for families. The deepest section is 5 feet. There is also a hot tub. Towels are not provided. Every night from 5:30pm to 7:30pm, there is a manager's reception where they serve free drinks by the outdoor pool and snacks by the indoor lounge area. There are numerous flat screen TVs, so sports fans will be quite happy here. Embassy suites is known for their breakfasts, especially their made to order omelets, and they are great. There is also a hot food section with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, and oatmeal. There is also fresh fruit and yogurt as well as pastries and English muffins and bagels. There is also milk, juice, tea, coffee, and soda. The chef who made my omelet every morning is so pleasant and she remembered me because I ordered the same thing every day. There is usually someone greeting you at the entrance of the restaurant where breakfast is served. They will ask for your room key and then cheerfully say, \"Enjoy your breakfast.\" Our room was nice and modern and spacious for 2 people. As per the usual Embassy Suites room, we had a sitting area with a couch, chair, and desk. We had 2 TVs, one for the \"living room\" and the other for the bedroom. There is also a desk, as well as a fridge, which is great for storing drinks. There is also a coffee maker, and they provide you with a bottle of water, but according to the tag around the bottle of water, it costs $4.95. It was also nice to have 2 closets, which allowed plenty of space for 2 girls. The interesting thing about the desk is that the socket doesn't provide electricity to charge your phone or other electronic equipment, so make sure you check that when charging electronics. The beds were comfortable. You can hear hallway noise sometimes, but fortunately that didn't bother us too much. Our room was by the staircase, which made it easy for us to go to and from the lobby as long as the towel was stuffed in the door. The bathroom was standard, slightly small, and the bathtub looked a little rusty. Water pressure was fine, but the tub wouldn't drain as quickly with the shower on, so you would be standing in a little bit of water while showering. The good thing is that the sink had a lot of counter space and is not in the same place as the shower, so that one person could be showering while the other was brushing teeth. There is a business center with 3 computers and a printer. The computer is a little bit slow, but there are direct links to airlines to you can check in and print out your boarding passes easily. There is also a small exercise room with about 3 treadmills and 1 elliptical machine. Each has its own Cardio Theater, which is great. You have to bring your own headphones. There are also a limited number of weights. Most people, though, chose to go running outside, swim, or play golf because the weather was quite nice this time of year. Overall, this was a good place to stay for the travelers who are here for a conference and have limited time to explore Phoenix because they have to be at the conference. The golf course and swimming pool are located behind the hotel. The hotel is quiet and in a residential area of Paradise Village. It is a 15 minute walk to some of the nearby restaurants. If you stay here and wish to go other places, you will either have to take a taxi or drive a car.

The location is sort of out the way from most attractions in Phoenix, a reason the front desk used to justify the $15 per day charge for wi-fi. The rooms, while large, are rather dated and not in the best of shape. Our room (actually a 2 room suite had wallpaper that was loose and dirty carpeting. In fact, housekeeping did not vacuum the carpets for the first 3 days. While we had 2 flat panel TVs, the selection of stations was very limited. Some things to beware of if you choose to stay here: The $15 a day charge for wi-fi (the rooms at one time allowed hispeed connections, but that has been discontinued; no coffee is available in the lobby after breakfast (you can buy a cup for $3.50 at the bar; the bottle of water in the room costs $4.95 per bottle (not a big bottle either); and beware if your credit card is also a debit card. They put a hold on a significant portion that can take up to 3 weeks to get released; I found it interesting that when I commented on the wi-fi charge, the person at the front desk later tracked me down and gave me an article on hotels charging for wi-fi. The basic premise is that since people now use cell phones, hotels have lost a big source of revenue from the use of in-room phones so thay make it up with wi-fi charges. When I stated that many hotel chains and mom & pop motels provide it free, the person argued with me and said he had worked in a number of hotels and they all charge for wi-fi.

The GOOD: My father, brother and I booked a 2 bedroom suite with a view of the golf course. I called this hotel the day before our arrival and left a message for the hotel manager, Jessica, confirming ourselves into a good room and upon arrival she greeted us and had us reserved in room 6013 (possibly the best view of the golf course and on the top floor). The room was clean, spacious, updated and as previously mentioned had a spectacular view. The shower was spacious and never had a problem with not having the towels restocked. The cleaning ladies were friendly and efficient as well. There are a lot of stores and restaurants surrounding this hotel and within walking distance (Olive Garden, Subway, McDonalds, Outback Steakhouse and Target among others). The pool and hotub area were well maintained and set to a perfect temperature. We were also able to walk the golf course and enjoy the scenery as the fairways and greens were in pristine condition. Every morning they held a make-to-order omelet breakfast that lasted from 6:00am-9:30am which also held a wide range of breakfast items from muffins, bagels, toast, coffee, juices, sausage, bacon, hashbrowns, fruit, yogurt and pancakes. Each night the hotel had Managers Reception which allowed all guests of legal drinking age to enjoy complimentary drinks from 5:30pm-7:30pm. The BAD: When booking this hotel a big advantage this hotel had over others was the complimentary full breakfast it offered. Unfortunately the hotel staff did not seem ready for the amount of guests it had booked during the long weekend. The seating area was not able to hold the amount of guests booked at this hotel and had guests venturing out to the bar area and lobby in order to have breakfast. Ontop of this, it was rare to even see one bus-boy clearing tables leaving guests to set dirty trays wherever they could find. The line-up to get an omelet averaged around 15-25 minutes and getting to the other types of food in the chafing dishes was always a challenge as well. I have been to the Embassy Suites in San Diego and LA and both had bigger and better lobby areas as well. Don't get me wrong, a lobby does not make or break a hotel but I just remember being \"wowed\" in San Diego when walking into the main entrance and seeing fish swimming in the indoor pond and being able to walk over the bridge having the fish swim directly beneath you compared to walking into the E.S. in Scottsdale and seeing... a normal lobby. The Ugly: What I still am scratching my head over is the fact this hotel just underwent renovations to update the rooms and hallways yet decided against renovating the elevators. Such a small cost yet it was left untouched. They were the only thing in this whole hotel that looked dated. Again, an elevator doesn't make or break a hotel but if I were the owner, I'd reconsider that decision. All in all we enjoyed our visit to Phoenix and had a good time at the Embassy Suites. It was a nice place to come back to after a long day of doing tourist activities. I think if I visited this hotel when it was not a long weekend the breakfast service would not have been an issue. I would recommend for the owners of the hotel to invest some more money into some minor renovations to possibly turn this 3 star hotel into a 4 star.

I stayed here one time and there was a wedding party happening. It was rather loud in the lobby area but the rooms were perfectly quiet. You are only about 15 drive fom Scottsdale airport and about 30 min drive from PHX in moderate traffic. The beds are very comfy! The covers for the beds are plush. The rooms are big.

The two beds were double and seemed short - not a problem for me, but someone tall might have a tough time. I didn't think they were overly hard either - slept well. We ordered room service on Friday night after more drinks than were advisable to drive for dinner and the food was fairly good, plentiful and no more expensive than usual. It is close to shopping - Paradise Valley mall is an older mall, but we certainly didn't have trouble spending money. There are also many other stores nearby. We had little interaction with the desk area after check in which was easy and the clerk was courteous. Towels were quickly supplied as was room service.", "Date": "June 19, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Embassy Suites Phoenix-Scottsdale", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d224250-Reviews-Embassy_Suites_Phoenix_Scottsdale-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "Price": "$92 - $193*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4415 East Paradise Village Parkway South</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Phoenix</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">AZ</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">85032</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "224250", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/72/5f/725fa723ce7e1ce28f1a9b60a6cd11ec4large.jpg"}}
