With a quick phone call to the hotel to annouce your arrival they notify you that the shuttle will be on its way to meet you from the bus stop. This can be quite confusing but simply head towards number 1 and you will see a sign for hotel buses and the minibuses that arrive have the hotel name on so you can't go wrong. The bus is air conditioned and will go to other terminals to pick up other passengers. The day before you leave you need to tell the reception what time you need to leave and the minibus is arranged to take you back. Saves you a lot of Euros so a great bonus. The reception staff are very helpful and speak english. If you want to use the wifi you must collect daily a sheet of paper with the login details. We had good connection in our rooms but not by the pool. The pool is open 1pm- 8pm this can be annoying but we found it adequate. There are parts which are in shade due to the large trees but this is often welcomed in the 40degree celsius heat! The only problem was that there are only 9 sunbed two of which are broken but still useable so if you are a sun worshipper you need to be there at 1pm however people come and go from the pool so you might get lucky. The hotel has towels available at the pool so you dont need to bring your own. There isnt a bar by the pool but they dont mind you eating and drinking. We didn't choose the buffet options for eating as they were pretty dear. about 10euro for breakfast and 17euro for lunch/dinner. We went to the local supermarket which is a 3-5min walk and bought croissants, jam and salami's for breakfast and made sandwiches for lunch. There are bars and other places to eat in the hotel which are nice and restaurants within walking distance mainly italien and burger places but resonably priced. The rooms are of a good decor and high standard. Cleaned everyday so if you are staying more than one night remember your do not disturb sign so you don't get woken by the maid. The ensuite in the room was clean and always had hot water. All rooms have balconies and there are twin and double rooms. There is air con which is defo needed in the heat. Only negative was found the bed rock hard/firm which was a struggle when you are staying for 8 nights and there is no fridge which would be nice for water. There was some building work going on which they advied through posters near the lifts, so heard hammering from about 9am which was a little annoying for those who want to lie in. To get to central madrid you can walk to Alameda de Osuna metro station to get the line 5 metro. This takes you to all the best places. I suggest getting off at callao as gran via, sol, opera are all within walking distance. I suggest buying the 10 journey ticket its 12 euro but can be used for more than 1 person as it simply deducts the journey so you can pass the ticket back to whoever you are travelling with. I would defo recommend this hotel and would return again for a city break to Madrid.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlottesville, VA", "Title": "\u201cRight hotel for the right reason\u201d", "Author": "PlayballTim", "ReviewID": "UR137937824", "Content": "Better-than-average hotel <2miles from the airport, but ~a half hour from the heart of the city, so you know that it's a very good overnight hotel for the airport.

The room itself is pretty clean, nicely furnished with a nice TV. The lobby looks nice and has a magazine and news stand with a few restaurants in it (do not eat there).

After waiting 45 minutes for the free bus shuttle, I called the hotel to ask if I should take a taxi. 15-20 minutes later the shuttle arrived and took 15-20 other minutes to go to the hotel, because of the traffic and the tour it had to do. The hotel was announced to be at \"only 10 minutes from the airport\", according to Iberia's desk... Except the hotel registration desk, everything was at least minimal when not insufficient in the Tryp Diana, announced as a 4-star hotel. The carpet in the room corridor was at least 10 years overused. The room door had probably been forced by a screwdriver before; I even tried to open it with my room key-card and only stop to not brake it but I am sure I would manage to open the door, like in an old US motel. I therefore decided to take my laptop with me when I went downstairs to get the offered \"last-meal\": I had the right for a glass of wine (just one, probably to not risk to get drunk, anyway I could not choose the wine and it was definitively cheap). The fish was overcooked and too salty like the soup (nice combination). I could exchange after some discussion and my request to get an invoice, a 1-hour (of very slow) Internet connection in exchange of the 6-minute phone call Iberia had apparently generously negotiated (which I did not know anyway). The bathroom was spartan and the bathtub was old and also overused - no invitation for a bath. I also refrained to remove my shoes in the room, because the room carpet smelled the dust and was likely inhabited. Phonic insulation was totally lacking (even for a 2-star hotel it would have been bad) and people where arriving and having noisy showers until 2 in the morning and others got up at 4 am and had showers, probably to get their plane. I would therefore never stay on my own in this hotel and would not advise anybody to get there, even for free. Should I again miss a plane in Madrid, I will certainly not accept to go in this hotel again, even if I have to pay another one on my own.

So the evening meal provided is very basic with only a choice of two starters and two mains, the quality of all of these were poor at best. Desert was cornetto type ice cream, on a take it or leave it basis. Breakfast was okay by Spanish standards. The only saving grace we thought in this hotel were the bars around the reception which served good Tapas and wine/beer. However, that thought changed as given it was a Friday evening the parties tarted in teh bars and went on till 5:30am Saturday, our rooms were on the first floor directly above, so very litlle sleep that night.

Our first impression in the lobby was that this place was very outdated and needed drastic renovation, but were we in for a real shock when we went up with the elevator and entered the corridor to our room. The carpet was apparently not from the last century but most likely from the century before that, if that is at all possible. The room was soul destroying after the long delays we had already endured, there was nothing appealing in it, the wardrobe doors and surfaces on the furniture and upholstery felt dirty and grimy, the bathroom was below standard with minimum amenities and inadequate toiletries, the toilet was horrific, rusty and stained from calcium and hard water not thoroughly cleaned off on a regular basis. We took a chance and slept in the bed, but were wondering if we were the only creatures on the matress.

The Tryp Diana hotel seemingly fit all our requirements; close to Terminal one, a courtesy van to and from the airport, and an early breakfast buffet that starts at 6:30 AM. The morning of our departure, we were a few minutes early and we decided to come down to the breakfast room. Once there we found all the lights on, apparently all the food in place, all the doors open, and nobody in charge. Since it was about 6:20 AM we thought it would be fine if we sat down for breakfast. It was just a few minutes later that a woman employee came to the room and started to shout, telling us that it was still not open and we should not be there. I tried to explain that we saw everything ready, the lights on, and that we thought a few minutes should not matter. She angrily replied that the lights were not all on, and that it was only 6:20 AM !!!!!!!. My wife and I offered to leave the room and I asked the woman to calm down or otherwise I will have to go to the front desk and report her, she defiantly replied, \"I will go with you\". I told her that it would not be necessary and I will do it right away, once at the front desk the people in charge where surprised about this incident and told me that they will talk to her. We went back to the breakfast room (it was now 6:30AM), and finished our badly interrupted breakfast. I also want to add that the breakfast ingredients were not of good quality and some were not fresh. All this incident has been reported by letter to the people in charge. My suggestion to all travelers would be to stay away of this hotel (there are several other available), but if you need to stay there, just take the room, go early to the airport and have some breakfast over there. Otherwise most of the staff was polite, and the courtesy van was on time. The rooms were not as good as those of a true four star establishment and there was a lot of construction going around.

FYI: cab cost us about 15 euros. The hotel is on a street with several other hotels. It seemed to be a fairly residential neighborhood.

The room itself was very large, with a comfortable queen-sized bed, table and chair, desk, computer hookups, and TV. There is also a nice tour book of Madrid to browse through. Finding a welcome with my name on the TV screen when we entered was a nice touch! The bathroom provided oversized, plush bath towels, 2 hand towels, and several amenities such as shoe shine, comb, and an in-shower shampoo/body wash dispenser.

That's the positives.

Twice it sped past the pick-up area at about 40kmph but despite diving out in front of it, it \"didn't see us\".
