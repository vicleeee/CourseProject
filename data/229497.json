As prices go up quite a bit over new year in most hotels around Amsterdam we got a really good price for this one! First impressions walking in to the hotel was how great the service was and how beautiful the lobby was. There was a log fire burning which was really nice as it was snowing outside. Going into our room we were gobsmacked because of the size of it! It was so spacious, clean & cosy at the same time. The bed was HUGE!!! and also really comfy, I slept very well whist staying here. The curtins are great too as they block out ALL of the light. There was a flat screen TV, wine glasses, cups, coffee facilites & a fridge. The bathroom was also very modern and clean. We loved the shower. The room was cleaned every day. I've been to Amsterdam quite alot and we just loved this location of this hotel, it wasn't far from central station or the dam square, less than 5 mins walk to each.

The hotel we choose is important for location and that is why we have always booked the Marriott Renaissance. The ambience of the makeover they have completed recently was amazing. The welcome area and lobby are warm and inviting. There is a fireplace and seating where we always had coffee and waited for our friends to arrive. The location is perfect for everything including restaurants, walks, canal boats, clothing stores, souveneers and even groceries. A 2-minute walk up the alley will bring you onto a major tourist walk where you can find everything. The tram is a short half block walk that can take you right to the museum area as well. The rooms are a bit small but comfortable with newly designed bathrooms. Wi Fi and wired rooms are available for a fee, but we would walk to a Bulldog nearby that offered free Wi Fi. There are 2 restaurants on property and the one we enjoyed for breakfast or early lunch was the Koepel Caf\u00c3\u00a9. We could sit outside and enjoy the nice weather, or indoors if inclimate happens. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone especially first time visitors, as the staff is ready to help you with your daily plans. We even had the concierge walk us over to the canal boats to get us on the best selection.

Amsterdam is a small city and most places are accessible from the hotel by foot and for the less nimble, access to the extensive tram network is very close by. Because you are situated close to the canals and are on the edge of the Red Light district, evenings can prove a little boisterous in a pleasant sort of way. Thanks to the ineptitude of British Airways, our visit should have been longer than the two days that it was, however we did manage to pack in a fair amount. Key places to visit are the Rijksmuseum, which has been in a curtailed form for a number of years, but will be fully restored and re-opened in 2013. It does however feature a very good exhibition on Dutch maritime history, as well as many fine and familiar paintings, including \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Night Watch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; also not to be missed is the Amsterdam Museum, which is close to the Calwerstraat and deals specifically with Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history, which is brought to life in a number of very good ways.

It's literally around the corner and a hop across a couple of streets. Can't be missed. Very convenient when you're totting luggage.

Very much in keeping w/ Marriott's customer service standards. Note: front office manager, Steve Provance goes above and beyond to be helpful. ROOMS- The rooms are very much what you would expect from a Marriott property. Very clean, large, and comfy. At least they were on the club/concierge level. Great place to return after walking all day, which is exactly what you'll do in Amsterdam. Note: I believe this building is shared w/ a night club in the rear. If you're a light sleeper be certain to request a room at the front of the hotel. Otherwise, you'll hear the music well. It wasn't a nuisance for me but I'd imagine it would be for some. As well as rooms with windows facing the alley. Most young kids park their bikes there and congregate after club hours before taking off. They aren't at all obnoxiously loud or anything like that but they can be heard at 3am. RESTAURANT- Within the hotel, there are a couple of different choices that are fine. A bit over-priced but that's typical within hotels. I'd recommend venturing into the city for a variety of food options- from various regions.

I have some mixed feelings about this hotel. On the one hand, there's nothing wrong with it all - nothing to complain about - but on the other hand, not a lot stands out, either. Our room was relatively small though perfectly adequate and faced in to an internal square (they call them \"quiet rooms\" - and they are, if people don't have their windows open while partying, which happened only one night but hey, it's Amsterdam and we were on holiday and it was pretty tough to complain about it and we didn't - doesn't affect our opinion - just thought I should mention it). When I'm on holiday I like to sit in the hotel and read with coffee or a drink and to watch the sights - well, I couldn't - so that, and the fact that internet was so expensive and sometimes iffy (I think it was 20 euros a day), are the only 2 downsides. The location is truly excellent - the hotel is walking distance to the train station (we took side-trips to Delft, the Hague); the Red Light District (odd! but very interesting!); the canals and everything actually, that there is to do. We walked and walked and walked. I never did manage to orient myself and was forever getting lost and wandering in circles (literally, one time I thought I'd walked a good distance and found a solo lunch spot and I looked out the back door and voila, there was the hotel) - but my husband got the hang of the city and spent hours traipsing around and exploring. The front desk staff were more-or-less welcoming but the concierge staff I found, were excellent. We found the restaurant to be expensive and did not eat there. I believe the breakfast alone was 26 euros. We found little bakeries and a grocery store (Albert Heijn) close-by and bought bread and cheese. So I give this hotel 4 stars but mainly for its location.

One note about reception to the elevators - you will have to make use of the ramps by the stairs from reception to get to the elevators if you have luggage and wish to carry this yourself. We were in room 562, which is their normal \"Deluxe\" room, with a view of the church across the street. The room was small (237 square feet), but functional for our short 2 day stay. If this were a longer stay, I would have attempted to book a larger room, as things did feel a little cramped after a while. The bedding and bath were both functional and comfortable, and the water pressure and temperature in the bath/shower were excellent. The only minor annoyance is that the corridor between our room and the elevator had a smell of fried/prepared food - sometimes smelling like fish.

The Renaissance Amsterdam is basically a good business type hotel conveniently located close to train station and Dam square. Upon booking thru Marriot's own site we called the hotel to double check the possibility of having 3 adults in the rooms (had booked 2 rooms) and ask for \"nice views\" as Amsterdam is of the few cities having so many \"blind\" rooms. We were allocated club rooms and we were happy...until we saw them...from the attached pictures one can see that it is absolutely impossible to fit 3 adults in a club room without actually jumping into the bed! In a 5 star hotel! The only available actual solution was an upgraded room with an extra charge of 75 euros per night, including breakfast and \"happy hour\" drinks in a designated area. So, some of us decided to pay the extra 225 euros, not having another choice, and the others not, as the third person was coming just for 1 night. And now comes Collin -- striking issue. One evening an extra guest from the allowed number joined the rest of the group in an empty bssiness lounge for a drink. I repeat one extra guest, one time. Having no idea whom we were, Collin -- gave us a ...warning not to repeat it, as \"the business lounge is for those paying for it\"! Never, ever in our lives had we been insulted so much. And please, keep in mind that we were there on a medical meeting with a registration fee of 1500 euros, staying at a 5 star hotel! I guess to that person's mind we had a great need for a free drink!!! Nowhere in the world that we have so far traveled or lived such an attitude was encountered. Assistant manager Marielle -- was very nice and apologetic for the incident but we think that the hotel and the Marriot chain should not let people such as Collin -- ruin their reputation.

Club Lounge continental breakfast is good but busy, (extra coffee machine needed) and we felt somewhat restricted in the evening using this facility but that maybe down to the large number of corporate guests that were resident during our stay.

I had purchased a GVB (public) transit card for the duration of my stay but ended up using it only twice as most things are under a mile from the hotel. In regard to amenities, the hotel offers coffees and teas in the morning (at the bar) free of charge. They can be enjoyed with the complimentary newspapers located throughout. A concierge plus an information type office staffed by friendly personnel can help you plan your day. The rooms are larger than most standard rooms I've stayed at in Europe. Our room was equipped with a large flat screen TV with limited channels. We had a robe in need of fabric softener and slippers in our room. The room had a safe, hair dryer, and iron with ironing board. The comfy king bed had a total of 6 nice pillows. The room was warmer than I liked and a/c was a little difficult to operate. Fortunately, the windows open so the temperature wasn't too hard to control. Other reviewers are correct in stating that noise carries. Thanks to those reviewers, I took some earplugs and only noticed the noise before turning out the lights. I forgot to put them in one night and did get waken up but I think it all depends on how much of a light sleeper you are. It is by no means a \"noisy\" or unruly hotel. It is actually pretty quiet and I believe that makes the occasional door slams or voices in the hallway much more noticeable. Earplugs were a small price to pay for such a conveniently located and well managed hotel. The only other small nuisance was that water temperature in the shower fluctuated briefly but often while bathing. The hotel does have a pretty good sized, yet under utilized fitness center with modern equipment. Internet access is available for a hefty price. Unless you really need the web in your room, I suggest strolling into a coffeehouse and paying on average of about 1 euro/10 minutes to use one of their computers. If you're taking a laptop, free, albeit unsecured wifi can be found at many dining/drinking establishments. For those of you who are wondering but afraid to ask ......If you walk for 10 minutes you will have passed quite a few 'smoking' coffee shops, some gay establishments, several slot only casinos, a couple of windows for gawking at (or pitying) the ladies and well, just about anything else. In regard to food, there is no shortage of places to eat nearby. I didn't try the food at the hotel. There are too many choices nearby that will not put as much of a dent on your wallet. For breakfast, some egg & bacon type cafes were close enough, good enough and cheap enough (6-7 euro plates). For lunch, steer clear of the pizza by the slice place that's behind the hotel. You'll only get horrible pizza if you're lucky. Nice dining can be found around the corner on Spuistratt. The Chinese & Indonesian restaurant is terrible so opt for the Thai place next to it. Sorry if I went beyond just reviewing the hotel. Many folks, like me, choose a hotel based not only on comfort but also take convenience into account. After several trips to this fine city, I've concluded that the Renaissance is the ideal place when looking for an excellent mix of both. Many might find this hotel a little too modern, but after a 14 hour journey or in preparation for one, I opt for modern.

Fortunately there are plenty of nice cafes and restaurants a stones throw away where they will happily dish you up a big breakfast, luch or dinner at a quarter of the cost (6-9 euros) Conclusion: Fantastic, wonderful hotel but watch the prices of the extras. Make sure you get a good deal from your travel agent with BREAKFAST INCLUDED. All in all 5 stars. One of the best hotels I have stayed in, even with the criticisms of the prices. The staff, facilities and comfort of this hotel were second to none. ***** 5 stars.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Knoxville", "Title": "\u201cThe Perfect Spot to Launch a River Cruise\u201d", "Author": "RTK1316", "ReviewID": "UR90478972", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at this hotel for three nights in October, prior to a (Gate 1) Rhine River Cruise.

Lobby service was excellent, and the concierge got us tickets for a canal cruise, as well as the Van Gogh Museum. The Club Level was a real plus, with high-speed internet and all-day access to snacks, newspapers, etc. Our room was clean, well-appointed, and functional, offering everything we needed for a place that we pretty much only wanted to sleep and refresh in. (Really; we didn't come to Amsterdam to stay in our room!) More than anything, we loved the location of the hotel. Even though we could pretty much walk everywhere from there, we took the trams a few times, since they all seem to congeal at Centraal Station anyway.

That is a huge sum for U.S. citizens...anyway the room was beautiful but NO COFFEE/TEA FACILITIES, something I am quite used to in lesser bargain hotels.

So difficult to sleep...so loud outside with doors slamming and an all-nite club right outside the window of my 3rd Floor room. Wonderful! So I was told turn down the heater from high to low.

The Club Room had a brick wall, and was an inside room so not that much noise from outside came in. All rooms have conditioner, shampoo, modern hair dryer, bath gel, bath salts, bath cap, modern bathroom, spray shower head, extra toilet paper, minibar (which you pay for, so not really a big deal), ice facilities, extreme security, elevators that were not really slow, and helpful \"At Your Service\" employees who allowed me to briefly check my email/print boarding passes/toothpaste and toothbrush which I forgot also given to me at no charge... Can't recommend this hotel at the moment.

It's also perfect for getting an organised canal cruise from right outside Central Station. Some of the best bars in Amsterdam are within easy walking distance of the hotel, these were located between the hotel and the Red Light District, lots of cosy pubs with wide ranges of beer and friendly people. The hotel bar is very modern, prices are typical 4* prices but they are worth it for the good service and atmosphere.

Very few steps and traffic lights to get through before you hit the hotel. Just look for the dome-shaped building which is directly across from the hotel.

Sure, the rooms are a bit small but that's Amsterdam. You can't expect a ton of space while traveling big cities in Europe--it's just not possible unless you're staying in Presidential suites. I found the bed very comfortable and the entire hotel was spotless.

The rooms where not too small, good size for a weekend-stay, clean, nicely designed, bathroom spotless and all necessary items available - toilettries and hairdryer. The only thing I didn't like about the room was that it had only one rather small window and therefore it was a bit dark even with opened curtains (that's 0,5 star minus). The Full American Breakfast Buffet offered everything one could ask for, the logistics could be improved, we had several empty tables but the dishes had not cleaned away and so we had to wait for a table to become available (that's the other 0,5 star minus).

We chose to take a hotel shuttle instead. You can follow the signs once you come out of baggage claim. We took the Connexxion shuttle and it was 25 euros if you purchase a round trip ticket or 15 euros one way. I believe there is also public transportation that can take you to central station. Hotel is located close to tram stop and a short walk to central station Hotel a bit outdated. Our room was in a different wing of the hotel and we had to take 2 elevators and walk down several hallways to get to it. Front desk staff are nice and when we asked to switch rooms they were willing to accomodate us Room is an average size for Europe standards. We didnt spend much time in the room except to sleep and shower. they have lots of English channels on TV Hotel concierge sells tickets to the museums at cost. I thought this was great as it saves time having to stand in lines at the museums or go to the TIs to purchase them. They also sell the 24 hour transportation card for 7 euros. It can be used on trams, metro, train and bus. Individual tickets are 2.60 euros so its worth it to get the pass. You can also charge these to your room. We used the tram to get most places I had heard that many places dont take credit card in Amsterdam but most of the places we went to did. Only a few did not. If you change money at the airport I think if you change at least $300 they waive the commission fee that they usually charge. Maps can be a little confusing but if you are up for trying to figure it out its not impossible and people at the hotel and restaurants are very nice and most will try to help you. 20 Euros for 24 hour internet!! And you have to pay for internet in the public area as well. On the public internet area by the lounge, they do let you print your boarding passes for free which I thought was nice even if you couldnt use the internet for free.

This historic centrally located property inherits Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique character, including the local charm and quirks. It is an excellent hotel for business and leisure, but may not be the best option for travelers on a budget. Getting in and out The Renaissance Amsterdam is located a few blocks from the railway station, with regular and reliable connections to Schiphol Airport. Taxis to the airport are also available for approximately 50 Euro. However, parking near the hotel is costly. My first time finding the hotel, I got lost. The lobby entrance is tucked around the corner from the main road leading from the train station, so be sure to consult a map prior to arrival. After you actually get inside, check-in with the staff is casual and efficient. However, the lobby is small and awkwardly shaped with steps and ledges, and if you have mobility issues or lots of luggage, then ask for assistance from a bell hop. Bedroom and Bathroom The Renaissance Amsterdam has stylish, uniquely designed guest rooms that are carved into a building with historic architectural detail. This atmosphere is charming, but occasionally constraining. Louder guests can sometimes be heard from adjacent rooms, and guestrooms on the top floor have angled ceilings. Request a lower floor if this is a problem. I was pleased to find a large-screen LCD TV, an iPod dock, and a digital safe in each room. Some upgraded rooms also offer sitting area or couch, which is a great for relaxing with a few drinks. Internet access is available at an extra charge. The en-suite bathrooms are sleek and modern with chrome dark wood vanities, white surfaces, and chrome fixtures. On my first visit, I was pleasantly surprised with a walk-in-shower, but disappointed when I had to call maintenance to come and unplug the drain. Also, if you are traveling with kids, be sure to request a room with a bath tub when booking or checking-in. Otherwise, you might need to use one of Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sparkling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd canals. Food, Drink, and Amenities The Renaissance Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surrounding neighborhood offers museums, restaurants, and shopping that attract a mixture of crowds during the day and night. Umbrellas are offered at the lobby entrance, which is convenient during one of Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frequent and heavy downpours. The concierge desk did recommend ticket and transportation options, but did not appear to be a dedicated expert. For a great meal, check out the Turkish restaurant across the street. The hotel also offers a variety of in-house eating and drinking options, including a full-service restaurant, a pub/bar, and a club lounge. The squid-ink pasta at the Mediterranean restaurant was tasty and attractively presented, and and each dish features a wine suggestion. The pub was dark and cozy, with an attractive selection of light meals and snacks. I tried the burger with fries, which was excellent.

Since this meant we could get two double beds instead of a rollaway bed, plus free breakfast, we went for it. So, I don't know what the standard rooms are like, but the club level room was very nice. It was definitely on par with a Marriott hotel room in the U.S. Average size, with nice amenities, nice bathroom. Very comfortable beds. And very clean, of course. The club level continental breakfast was wonderful! Best yogurt I've ever tasted, and a machine offering your choice of about eight different cappuccinos, lattes, etc. Also offered meats, cheeses, good pastries - all the standard stuff - in a very comfortable lounge. Club level also offered an evening happy hour that included an incredible array of desserts. And the fridge in the lounge always had a variety of waters, soda, and juices available. Club lounge also had a nice, fast computer available. Hotel lobby was very pretty (modern decor). We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant. Our experience with the staff was very positive.

I don't think you could find a better location if you want to stay in central Amsterdam. It took us less than five minutes to walk from Central Station (with rolling luggage), yet the hotel itself is on a quiet side street half a block from a canal. We liked the location better than that of the Grand Hotel Amrath, which we thought was a little too far to the eastern side of the central city.

Check in and out was efficient. The problem with the building being odler is the lack of sound proofing from the outside. My room (118) was just above street level and the traffic noise was quite intrusive late in to the night and from early morning.

This is a great hotel in a great location. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a simple five minute walk from Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Central Station so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re flying into Amsterdam, take the train from the airport. It costs only four euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and takes around fifteen minutes. A taxi will cost up to eighty euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and can take twice as long. The hotel was recently renovated and has a modern, comfortable look. Due to my Marriott Elite status, we were upgraded to a superior room with access to the Club Lounge. Even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t qualify for a complementary upgrade, you may want to consider paying for access to the lounge. Unlike many other lounges in the Marriott/Renaissance chain that close their lounges on weekends, the Renaissance Amsterdam Club Lounge is open seven days a week. Also unlike others that have an honor or paid bar, wine, beer (Heineken and Amstel of course) are free. An assortment of waters, juices and soda are available all day and night as well. There are three food offerings per day. Breakfast (cereal, breads, pastries, fruit, juices, etc.), nightly hors d'oeuvres and desserts. Also included is free internet but it is only available on the one computer located in the lounge. While wifi is available throughout the hotel, it comes with a steep price. 19.95 euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s per 24 hours. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around $34! Another alternative for free internet is going to one of the several Bagels and Beans locations throughout Amsterdam. The closet one to the hotel is about a 10 minute walk. You can sit as long as you want and access their internet as long as you buy a coffee or bagel (both of which are pretty good in their own right). Other than Bagels and Beans, there are very few other free offerings for internet service. The rooms are comfortable and have more space than many typical European hotels. Beds are comfortable although they are not the new Marriott beds that you find state side. The room has a small but modern bathroom. There is a good size desk and plenty of closet space. There is an in-room safe, mini-bar and nice size flat screen LCD TV. There is a gym with plenty of new cardio machines although it is lacking in weight equipment.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s by far the best way to get around the city. There are bike lanes everywhere and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an easy ride to just around anywhere in the city given the cities flat terrain. There are several companies close to the hotel that rent bikes. Hotel Scooters is located a couple of blocks away from the hotel. They rent new, easy to ride bikes for 15 euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a day. Less if you rent for multiple days.

The hotel provides a very good detailed map, make sure you take a copy when offered on check-in. The rooms are all styled in the same decor, we know because we stayed in three different rooms!! They look as they do from the website and other travellers photographs. One thing to note and to ensure you make a request for on booking if privacy as a couple are important to you, is that you request a room which does not have inter-connecting doors!! Our first room did and we could hear all the details of the conversation of the guests staying next door and I guess likewise for them!! In the end we decided to up-grade to executive level which meant our room was up-graded to include a supposedly bigger room, a king size bed and also included access to the club lounge, which was expensive but well worth it. The rooms are on the small size with small but perfectly adequate fully functioning bathrooms, as expected from a city centre hotel. Furnished nicely and with most of the touches you come to expect with this class of hotel. Beds are on the soft side and the queen bed that we were orginally allocated was obviously quite old as you would have a tendency to roll towards the middle of the bed! Plenty of pillows and towels though. No tea or coffee making facilities in room nor complimentary water but (expensive) fully stocked minibar as well as room service. All staff are very friendly and helpful and service very efficient.

After much advance research I selected the Renaissance Amsterdam and was very pleased with the experience. My goals had been : -A good location -A large spacious room that would sleep 3 - A very comfortable bed for my picky husband(princess and the pea syndrome) -Ambiance, quality, decor, cleanliness etc. The hotel is near the Central Train Station which is actually very convenient and easy to access both in the arrival and in the departure from the city. The hotel has JUST been totally renovated and apparently fully reopened in May of 2009. The hotel is modern, well designed and appointed and very well maintained. As I was looking for a large room I asked the staff and they cheerfully supported my desire to actually look at and compare 5-6 rooms from a standard, deluxe and superior size. It was a Monday so maybe it was not as busy as later in the week. but it was very helpful for me. I found the front desk, the bell man(Marcelino) and the Concierge on duty(Leo) to be Excellent. Leo is originally from Indiana and knows his history and all areas of the city. from museums to restaurants. All of his tips were excellent. He was exceptional. I loved the location of the hotel although some might by looking at a map ask if it is really that convenient and the answer is yes. We like to walk as a matter of exercise(wearing off all the delicious food calories). But I liked the quiet street(this is a big deal in this city as it has a lot of young and energetic, visitors and residents) the modern sophistication of the hotel and the decor etc. So for us it was perfect. The city is fairly compact so walking to virtually all the areas we wanted to visit was very doable or if you prefer, the tram is readily available.I am very glad we selected The Renaissance over some of the more \"famous\" upper end hotels which frankly looked a bit tired from the outside and in noisier neighborhoods. While we mostly walked the tram is very easy to use and reaches all desirable areas. Biking was also great fun and while there are several rental shops one is very near the hotel. I have posted some photos of the room and the very nice size closet. The bathroom was very nice as well. This was a standard room but was spacious, quiet and comfortable. It was on an inside courtyard so no view but that ended up just fine. (rm 429). Each room has a similar overall interior decor but most rooms have differences in shape and view etc. There is an older portion to the hotel (back side I believe) that is thoroughly updated and modernized but some of those rooms were really great in their unique shapes. The first room I looked at on the 9th floor had a cool peaked ceiling, tall windows reaching up to the peaked ceiling and great light. A lot of ambiance but we decided was too small for 3 of us so we selected the 4th floor. There is also complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning! A nice perk.

Of course, because the concierge was drowning in luggage, there was no one available to help with info about tours, etc. As a result we lost out on opportunities for most of the longer tours we might have liked to book (that other cruisers we ran into who had booked themselves into lower priced lodging nearby were able to get assistance from their hotels in arranging). Hotel restaurants were closed on Sunday. After finding a place for lunch, then being able to check in to a room and waiting an hour, I wound up bringing up our luggage myself because things were still somewhat of a mess downstairs.

The first incident took a bit of doing and reminding later on about their agreement; the second incident had an immediate and surprisingly fair response. The one staff person who truly understood customer service and how to run a hotel was Guus Verhulst-outstanding hotel representative. Marriott should put him in charge of the whole place. Perhaps the most frustrating thing is the way you have to reach the front desk or concierge from a phone in the room. There is one button called \"Delighted to Serve\" ;ironically, it seems they are neither-they are not delighted and they do not serve. I attempted to use it and many times you are left on hold before speaking to anyone for long periods of time. I was connected to the wrong room a couple of times, I received misconnected calls, and yet it is the only button you can use to get anyone in the hotel. If you press \"0\" you get the acutal operator from the phone company. My brother in another room had as many or more issues and miscues on the part of the hotel all related to rather simple requests and service.

The others he spoke of were on the other side of the lounge and had not notified me that they were waiting to use the internet. I got up right away. I almost lost my temper to this man, but I did not want to be removed from the hotel so I simply left 8) I went to buy an internet card from the front desk (in-room fee for internet is OUTRAGEOUS). I wanted to buy the cheapest $5 EU / 15 minute card which was out of stock. So the lady wanted me to buy the more expensive card, and did not understand me when I said NO, and that I just wanted to check my email for a few minutes. She looked at me like I was fool 9) BIGGEST PROBLEM -- NEVER ENOUGH BATH TOWELS. Every single day I had to call the front desk for more bath towels. Most days they would remove our old towels and not give us any clean replacements. Other days they would just give us 1 towel. They knew there were 2 of us staying in this room, not just 1. Literally, there was not 1 day where I received enough towels without having to call downstairs. 10) Does this hotel even know what Platinum members are? They seem to do absolutely NOTHING for them 11) Front desk did not know how I could call Germany from the hotel room. The instructions in the room were incorrect and they did not know it was incorrect All in all this was the WORST Marriott experience I have EVER had. I did not believe this was a Marriott when I left. I love Marriotts, unfortunately I will not be coming back to this one, EVER. I fully expect Marriott to re-imburse a portion of the hard-earned points that I used to stay at this hotel. Worst service ever... Some of the staff are completely inept, others outright rude... To add further insult, I made it a point for the hotel manager to contact me about my problems during my stay... Guess what, no hotel manager ever contacted me during my stay.

NEGATIVE:The hotel has been undergoing renovation which was visible in the parking garage where one floor was packed with old furniture and other equipment. The elevators also had old interiors from which you could tell that renovations must have happened in all other areas of the hotel which were very modern.

Have tried different locations and have been in budget hotels and business hotels. So far, the Renaissance takes the cake for being the best. The hotel has just been newly renovated. The lobby is impressive and the rooms are fairly large by Amsterdam standards. There's an LCD TV and in the rooms I stayed at, King size beds. The fitness centre was also just newly opened and it was quite well equipped. I stayed on 2 separate occassions for a total of 2 weeks. Now I never stayed at Renaissance before so I am not aware how it looked before the renovation. But just looking at it today, I must say it was well worth it. The fact that Centraal Station is just a 5 minute walk away is a big plus. The Jordaan and Dam Square are also nearby so plenty of choices in as far as eating out is concerned. Kalverstraat, Amsterdam's main shopping street was just a couple of roads away. Despite the central location, it was very quiet and peaceful. I imagine such was not the case when the renovation works were on full blast, but I did not encounter any such noise during my stay, so I assume most if not all of the work had been completed at the time. I was staying on a corporate rate of 145 Euro and breakfast was not included. Reasonable enough for the location and particularly for business travellers though admittedly expensive if you were paying from your own personal pocket. But hey, this is Amsterdam and hotels are meant to be expensive. Space comes at a premium. Breakfast was also quite expensive ranging from around 19+ to 24+ Euros. It was buffet style but the cheaper option allowed you only to have cold cuts and bread. The most expensive option included the hot items such as bacon, eggs, sausages as well as cereals and pancakes. In the few occassions I did have breakfast, I found the food and service to be quite good. But frankly, I usually just grabbed something from Albert Heijn at Centraal Station and had my breakfast on the go. Even on corporate account, I found that it just was not value for money. There were also several other places to eat at just outside the hotel which possibly offered better value for breakfast. One other negative was the broadband service. There was no short term service available, only a 24 hour rate or longer could be purchased and it came to about 20 Euro for each 24 hours. Now I typically used the service in the evening after dinner just to do some more work and to catch up on news from home. Again despite the fact my company was paying, I felt I still was not getting value for money so I used the service only a couple of times. Admittedly, most hotels still try to make money out of what to me is part of the basic services that a hotel should provide, so the Renaissance is not an exception in this case. Overall, for the business traveller, I would say the Renaissance is a good and central place to stay in.", "Date": "April 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel but a little on the pricey side\u201d", "Author": "bison1847", "ReviewID": "UR27352909", "Content": "Very nice hotel with ok room service and nicer rooms.

I would have felt very angry if I was paying this much for such a stay, with this level of disruption, noise, and odd smells. My rating is strictly based on what I got for the price I paid and my imagination of how the property would be rated after the renovations are finished.... For the price I paid, and what rooms were going for in Amsterdam at the time, the problems were bearable. Location: This hotel is in a convenient location, where you can easily walk to and from the Central Station. Its also quite a short walk from Dam Square. We could not find the entry, however, due to the many construction areas. Things may have changed by now.

I found the choices made for carpeting, curtains and duvets very pleasant and modern and I really liked the lighting choices in these rooms and all the small decorative touches. Huge flat screen TV with good channel choices was also a nice plus. Bathrooms: Very nicely renovated, with great amenities, hair dryer, robes and adequate shower pressure. No hot water problems. Lobby: This is a very small unwelcoming lobby. You will not want to spend much time here. During our stay the sewer smell in the lobby was so unbearable, you wanted to run through it. I think other reviewers had noted a similar smell as well. They do supply free water bottles and coffee in the lobby in the morning.

The quality of other items on the breakfast buffet was not to my liking, this could just be regional variances, but I would tend to avoid the sausages and breakfast potatoes. Our room was nicely decorated and clean with everything working. The bed was fitted with a Topper, which did nothing to hide the central dip and as a consequence the first night especially was very uncomfortable. Breakfast was about 24 Euros and in room movies 14 Euros or 27 Euros for unlimited 24 hour access. Overall I would say the staff were working in a hard environment and no doubt have to deal with a larger amount of complaints than normal. Noise from builders at 8am during the weekend probably one of the main ones.

We took the train from Schipohl Airport to Amsterdam Centraal. The cost was 3.80euro one way per person. You can purchase the train ticket by credit card at the machines, but you need to know your pin code to do so. If you travel lightly, this is an easy, quick and inexpensive way to get into town. On arrival Amsterdam Centraal, we walked to the hotel. Locating the hotel was a bit tricky, but once we did it proved to be a great home base for our stay. The entrance is currently on a side alley, and easily overlooked. Our room was good size; very clean, crisp and beautiful. The beds were extremely comfortable. The towels were large and soft. The flat screen television had several english speaking channels. Due to my Gold status, I had access to the Club Lounge. The Club Lounge is in a temporary location on the first floor which is small, but still nice with breakfast and evening appetizers and drinks, including alcohol. There is also a computer available with free internet access. There are some \"colorful\" coffee shops and gift shops near the hotel, but the area was safe and I never felt threatened. Being so close to the train/tram station was very convenient and I think the perfect location. We purchased a Strippen Karte from a nearby tobacco shop and used this on our tram rides. All of the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel conceirge's were always willing to provide good advice or help with tickets. You can purchase tickets at the concierge's desk for the Rijksmuseum and obtain discounts for other sights. You can prepurchase tickets for the Anne Frank Huis, the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum online through their websites before leaving home. I highly recommend this. It was a relief to walk past the very long line at the Anne Frank Huis and walk right in through the reservation door. There is a warning on the Marriott website that rennovations are in progress, and this was absolutely true. They seemed to be everywhere except inside our room. If you want to sleep late, this may not be the place for you until the rennovations are completed. I think it is worth noting that I spoke with several people that were returning guests to this hotel. They felt that the value of the hotel was such that the rennovations were worth enduring. We only encountered one slight inconvenience due to the construction. On our final morning, I awoke (by a scheduled wake up call) to discover we had no electricity in our room. I contacted guest service, and they immediately sent Maintenance up with a flashlight so I could use the restroom. They also located another room near mine that we could use to get ready, but by then the electricity was back on. Also, in our room was a cute little stuffed bear wearing a Renaissance Tshirt that said \"Thank you for bearing with us\".

Our purpose however was to use the hotel as a base for the city, we did not use the restaurant facilities so cannot comment on those. The hotel lobby had a rather pungent, sewer smell to it on occasions, again not the sort of thing you would expect from a 5 star hotel. This leads me on to Expedia, whom we booked through and booked on the phone with one of their agents at a call centre. We expressly asked for twin beds and were told the booking would be done on that basis. On arrival at the hotel we were told it was a double bed only room and no other rooms were available. At 4pm in the afternoon we asked for a put-up bed to be installed in the room, reception said that would be done after chasing them many times. We checked again later in the evening and on returning this was not done and we were told no more put-up beds were available. We managed to change room to a twin on the following day.

Stayed 4 days 2/1-2/5. My husband and I are regular travelers to Europe, first time vistors to Amsterdam. Loved the city and got very lucky with the weather. Very cold, but no rain! Everyone is very friendly! Airport transfers via train - the ticket kiosks at the airport accept credit cards so that made it easy to purchase 2 tickets for Central Station. The ride takes about 20 minutes and the hotel is a very short walk. The ticket kiosks at Centraal Station do not accept credit cards or cash, so you queue up and purchase your tickets from a teller. Allow some time during peak periods. The hotel - room #1 - we arrived and walked around 3/4's of the building before locating the entrance. We were in an alley and about to walk past the temporary entrance, when a hotel employee pointed it out - no signage. The temporary lobby is ok, small but tastefully decorated. We arrived around 9am, checked in right away and were shown to our room. I requested a renovated room. & we were shown to a room on the second floor - (only half of this floor has been renovated). The room decor is nice - appealing blues and aqua greens. We spent several hours exploring the surroundings of the hotel and then went back for a rest. All is going well until the jack hammer below our room starts up. When that wasn't going - they were using a sledge hammer. It rattled the room to the point that it knocked the t.v. out. We contact the front desk and ask to be moved. The hotel - room #2 - we were shown to the 6th floor. The bellman advised us that the 5th and 6th floors had already been completely renovated. Why didn't they put all guests on those floors???? This is the club floor - the club lounge is behind another door that you would access if your rate included that. I asked the bellman if we could get breakfast included in our rate for our trouble, he advised that he would check with the front desk and phone me back - never heard from him. Upon arrival into this room we notice a strange smell which I mistakenly assume will blow off, and so say nothing. We stay the night in this room and the smell only seems to get worse. Seems to eminate from the bathroom - so we keep the door closed. The next morning, we ask to be moved. We have 3 more nights and the thought of the stench is too much. The front desk is aware that this room has a foul odor and they had no explanation for why they put us in that room if there were others available. (room 620) The hotel - room #3 - we are headed out for the day and they have agreed to move us. No rooms are ready, but if we will pack our bags, they will move us and when we return, we'll be shown to the new room. Sounds good. We return to the hotel at 4pm and haven't been moved yet, but they give us our new keys (7th flr) and so we go transfer bags ourselves. No big deal. This room has a view on the interior courtyard (roof) and is much larger than the other 2. Seems far away from the construction zone and has no smell - so we are good with it. The following morning however, the construction workers were outside our door with a table saw finishing the hallway trim at 7:30 a.m. Hotel dining - the restaurant is closed for renovation, so breakfast is temporarily served on the 1st floor - buffet is 29 euros. Skip that - there is a great restaurant about 30 seconds from the hotel - called \"The Corner\". Staff is great! Food is great and not expensive. (Martelaarsgracht 26) Restaurants close to the hotel worth a try - Kopke - small Dutch cafe, owner working the floor, romantic, really fresh seafood. Savini's - small Italian restaurant, packed with locals, homemade pastas, passable wine list Casa di David - on the Signal Canal about 15-20 min walk from the hotel - fantastic!! Toscanini's is in all the guidebooks - make reservations before you leave for Holland - it's impossible to get in Hotel wrap up - Wonderful beds, very courteous staff, great location. Big bowl of chilled water bottles at the lobby level each morning, nice touch. Some days a water bottle was placed in our room and some days it wasn't.

You can't use the mini bar to chill your coke or lemonade as the drinks are sensored so they can charge you for anything that is moved. The hotel was nice enough but maybe not 5 star. They upgraded us to club class for the mix up earlier in the day but would not allow us in the Club Class lounge because we were peasants that didn't pay the 70 euro upgrade. Tip for travellers. On the main paved street there are 2 or 3 excellent internet cafe's. 2 euros for an hour surfing and you can disconnect at any time and use you're credit another day.

Booked the hotel at 200 euro a night for a double room with no extras- that too on lastminute.com - the rack rates are significantly higher - 390 euro - and am amazed that they can ask for so much for providing so little.

It was a bad omen when we had to walk to the hotel from the train station as it was too close for any cab driver to take us. The front desk was staffed by an inexperienced trainee who had major difficulties finding our reservation. The room was OK, but rather dark and the halls were dirty, lined with room service trays that had not been picked up. The worst feature was the lack of an in-room safe which is peculiar given that Amsterdam is a dangerous place in terms of theft of personal property. To that end, we had a carry bag stolen that night while we dined outdoors, and without an in-room safe, we were left to carry our passports on our person forcing us to spend half a day at the US consulate getting new passports ($200 later). We also lost a camera and diabetic supplies. The next day, we used the safe deposit boxes at the front desk for what was left of our valuables. Later that day, when we went to retrieve some personal items, we find that the front desk clerk neglected to give us a key to the box. Instead, she left it in an envelope with our room number in an empty break room. Luckily, nothing was missing. Even though the Marriott site says there is a fitness center at the hotel, the fitness facility actually is not part of the hotel itself and has a hefty premium charge.

This is my fifth trip to Amsterdam for vacation, and my fourth stay at the Renaissance. I can honestly say that the level of overall almost ridiculously friendly and attentive service has actually increased over the past 4 years. From the moment of check-in, great attention is paid to making sure that guests are comfortable, and that all needs are met. As with many trans-Atlantic visitors, we all show up and want to check in at 10:00am. This hotel goes out of its way to help make sure that guests are allowed to check in as expeditiously as possible. They hold luggage, give waiting guests access to the executive lounge upstairs and continue to follow-up with housekeeping to make sure that the wait times are kept to a minimum. The hotel has a large compliment of staff, including bell persons, front desk attendants, concierge, etc. Especially helpful and detail-oriented is the \"Guest Services Manager\" (whose name I must admit I can't recall at the moment). She is always there to help, and aside from the fact that she always seems to be going 1000+ MPH helping everyone within a 100 mile radius, she provides the finishing touch on what is a truly spectacular guest experience. In addition to the 400+ rooms (and they have some really cool Junior Suites which feature private balconies), the Renaissance has wonderfully appointed apartment units, located in several adjacent historic buildings. During my last two extended stays (last one was almost 3 weeks, this one only 2), I opted for the apartments, so that I could have a small kitchen, and some extra space for all of my junk. Last year, I was traveling with a friend, and we got a two-bedroom; this year, I went with the one. The apartments are a wonderful and affordable alternative, and I would invite people to enquire as to their availability. In both cases of my apartment stays, I have had a wonderful view of the Singel, and associated people-watching opportunities. The apartments are modern, spotlessly clean, fully amenitized sans air conditioning. I've not had a problem with this, however, as the apartments seem to be floor-through, so that you get a great breeze, and there are ceiling fans throughout. The hotel's location is great, just south of Central Station, and within easy walking distance of all attractions in the Centrum. There are canal taxis/boats which launch from the area just in front of Central Station, and you can easily take them down to the areas of the museums, and zoo, etc. I must admit that in the times I've been here, I've only eaten one breakfast at the hotel's restaurant. It was a great meal (if a little pricey, as I recall). There are so many places to eat within 1 block of the hotel, that I always feel compelled to wander about. There are two British pubs which serve \"traditional\" grub (heart attack stuff - GREAT!), and there's a cute little bagel place just across from the hotel entrance on the Singel canal. During the past year, the hotel has added high-speed internet access to all rooms, and there is high-speed wireless all over the place (for a fee). There is a business center, where you can hop on and check email, and print a document or two. For guests on the Club Floor (or those - like myself - who travel so much for work that we've managed to get Marriott Platinum), there is a wonderful executive club, with seemingly endless food and drinks on the 6th floor. That's my rambling for the Renaissance. I can't possibly recommend it highly enough. Whether for a short stay for business or pleasure, or a longer-term stay in one of the apartments of Junior Suites, the hotel is absolutely great and the staff's friendliness and helpfulness is what will make you want to return again and again.

The hotel itself was very secure- big doormen always around, we thought at first just because some of the Ukranian delegation was staying there but they security was good our entire stay, helpful staff and a good breakfast which seemed good value to us. internet facility was easy to use and relatively cheap The bed may have been a bit soft for our liking but we found the biggest problem was that the airconditioning wasn't as effective as we would have liked- the weather had just warmed up and sleeping with the window open could get a bit noisy late at night.

One hint-- buy tickets for museums and Anne Frank House from here or at the tourist info booth right outside the train station. This allows you to walk past everyone in line when you get there. What a time savings! Finally, eat at Humphrey's restaurant, just over a block away from the hotel. My friend and I ate there TWICE in our three night stay. For 18.95 Euro you get three courses with quite a selection. The restaurant is quite big with a nice atmosphere. More locals were there than tourists. How does white chocolate with egg nog sauce sound for dessert? I got that and a nice chocolate dish the next night. I got a deliciously prpeared salad with balsamic both nights (w/ sun-dried tomatoes, sweet peppers, etc.) One night I got the mixed grill, the other the grilled veal steak. Superbly done with lots of taste. Don't miss this one. We walked all over the city, looking to try something different. But, why pay almost double.

I thought I'd stepped into some commercial. When I arrived at 2 there was no problem getting a room and I asked for one overlooking the street. They gave me a room with a nice view. The room was clean, nice, and everything worked so just what I'd expect in a 5* hotel.

You have to prepay to use their business center....5 euros for 15 minutes of internet. You can get 15 minutes for 1 euro at any internet equipped hash house in town. Anyway, when the machine rebooted on me after almost finishing a long email, the desk lady told me she could not refund my 5 euros.

No pool, which a 5-start hotel must have. Hallways are ugly brick and dimly lit. Makes the place feel like a women's prison. Inside the room, everything's fine. Bed was comfy. AC worked great.
