Before we went we emailed the hotel to advise them of my dietary requirements,(I am Vegan) and not only did the tell us it was not a problem, but positively went out of their way to accommodate me.I This was a huge bonus for me as being Vegan is too much for some places!! Fantastic start before we even arrive! Upon arrival, (which incidentally was my friends birthday), the reception staff were so friendly and helpful and were aware of her birthday and gave us an upgraded room for free. When we got to our room, which was luxurious and beautiful, with a fantastic canal view, we noticed that they had also put in a letter of congratulations from owners of the hotel and a bottle of bubbly. All the staff at the hotel really could not do enough for us, talk about made to feel special. Their customer service could not be any better. The food was beautiful, the hotel had arranged vegan butter and vegan milk. They made me the best Latte ever!! One the evening we were due to leave, the hotel was hosting an event and the Proprietors (Eric and Petra) invited us in! They made us feel so welcome and really looked after us, the only bad thing was that we had to leave that evening! We really wish that we could have stayed.

After having been to Amsterdam a few times in the past, I knew I simply had to find a hotel that would enable us to stay on one of the old canals. I booked a small double canal room which faced Keizersgracht and it was absolute perfection. Although the room was on the smaller side, it had everything we needed. We really wanted to have the view of the canal in the morning and night and this definitely ticked that box. The deep reds and blacks in the decor of the hotel and room made it feel very cozy and luxurious. The room was a bit dark, but not too problematic. The bed was very comfortable with nice linen, there was plenty of closet space, and we even had our own nespresso machine which was a lovely touch. We were able to walk everywhere without having to hop on any of the trams as the location of the hotel was close to everything. The hotel is located about 7 minutes walking distance from the Centraal Station which you can get a 9 euro ticket to/from the airport.

Our stay was wonderful - we were in a room with a jacuzzi and a view of the canal in front of the hotel (room 119). The room was remodeled only three days before our arrival, so we may have been the first couple to stay there. The staff were wonderful and helpful, and the location is unbeatable - only a 5-10 minute walk from the loud touristy areas. I'll offer this small piece of advice though, and I don't hold this against the hotel at all: pay close attention to the photos before you book. This is a \"sexy\" hotel with lots of deep reds, shiny striped wallpaper (at least in our room), and multi-colored lights over the bed and in the jacuzzi that could be dimmed. It was a bit...too much for us. We're nerds with Ikea taste. I found myself spending quite a bit of time looking out the window at the quaint city view than looking inside the room because it was overwhelming. Again, I don't hold this against The Toren at all. It just wasn't for us. TIP: Don't pay for parking in front of the hotel, which you're not likely to find anyway and costs 50 Euros per day. When you check in, ask the staff to call a valet service for you. It costs half the price, and they were very professional and friendly. CLAUSTROPHOBES: You can take the stairs up to your room!

Some hotels near the center of the \"half circle\" city center- so to speak -are in quite loud neighborhoods. Had breakfast with lattees every morning, that was wonderful too. Although everything was top-notch, it was the service that stood out the most. I got the impression almost nothing was out of the question from the lovely staff. One night I had terrible heartburn and asked if they had anything for that or where I should go to get it.

Upon receiving our tip, the porters gently reminded us about the tipping policy in the Netherlands (which is usually no tip required). That was nice of them because later on in our trip a waiter at an unrelated restaurant took advantage of us disbelieving Americans. We never had breakfast at the Toren and found out the hard way that breakfast is hard to come by at nearby restaurants; so I suggest eating breakfast at the hotel if you crave American style breakfast food in the morning.

When we first arrived, we were greeted by a very friendly staff at the front desk. One of the young ladies at the desk (her name was Lisa) made sure that we were aware of the all the major attractions in the city. Throughout our stay Lisa continued to offer assistance in arranging the tours we wanted to see. We stayed in one of the Deluxe Suites overlooking the courtyard in the main house. The housekeeping staff made sure the room was cleaned every day. We'll probabaly stay in the garden cottage suite next time. At the end of the day, we'd look forward to meeting other guests in the lounge they have on the first floor. One of the bartenders (his name is Michiel) would ask about what we saw that day and would then provide us with a brief history of each attraction we visited. He even told us about a brewery that is located inside of a windmill and is located on the east side of Amsterdam. My wife and I went there on our last night with some friends we made while in Amsterdam. In fact, we still keep in touch with them. If you're planning a trip to Amsterdam, my recommendation would be to stay at The Toren. Between the quality of the rooms, the wonderful people they have hired to run the hotel and the location in the city, we would not consider staying anywhere else.

Spotless bathroom with a good shower and Rituals amenities (very good quality), Nespresso coffee machine, and welcome chocs (nice touch).

We didn't drink in the bar, but the porter showed us it anyway and it looked amazing! We were staying in the annex building, just a couple of doors down the street, and it was equally lovely. The decor throughout is very sumptuous and decadent. Our room was a double, with an amazing bath/shower (VERY deep bath and VERY powerful shower) ensuite. Again the furnishings were lovely in various shades of red, burgandy and purple. The room itself was on the small side, but I gather that that's a feature of the canal houses. It was a great touch to have a Nespresso machine in the room too. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant but does provide a menu from the nearby Christophe's, a formerly Michelin starred place (1989-2006), and will deliver - we didn't take them up on this but had a look at the menu and it looked very good, although unsurprisingly quite pricey.

You could spend all day considering other hotels but the Toren is central, beautiful, sumptuous, and is completely made glorious by its outstanding service from friendly English-speaking staff.

We had breakfast (which they kindly designed to our wishes at no extra cost) in the room whilst wearing the fluffy robes and slippers provided, we had drinks in the glamorous and stately bar, we walked along the canal and round the corner to Anne Frank house, we shopped at the little boutiques 2mins away. I slept like I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never slept before in the massive comfy bed. We stayed in the annexe but it felt exactly like the main hotel as the decor and branding is identical. Our room was not canal side but instead had a little terrace, shared with one other room. Only negatives I could find \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Our drawer unit was tiny and drawers kept sticking. Terrace was not cleaned in the 4 days we were there - a glass was left on the little table outside. One lightbulb was out in our chandelier. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention these whilst there. Coffee machine broken when we arrived \u00e2\u20ac\u201c replaced as soon as we mentioned it. Our Jacuzzi light not working, free drinks given as mentioned before... Not much really. I could have had these same \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglitches\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in another hotel and been left feeling cheated, but because at the Toren it seems to be all about their lovely staff and the instant attempt to make you happy as soon as they hear of a glitch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is priceless. Overall this is a hotel I can wholeheartedly recommend, just like most of the other reviews - people rave like about the Toren for a reason. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in lovely hotels in California, Hawaii, France and Spain and indeed others in Amsterdam, but this has been the best service and overall experience that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had.

Likewise, you may have visited somewhere that doesn't rank highly on your \"places I've been\" list but the hotel was spectacular and helped make your trip memorable. Well, the Toren is one of those vacation-defining hotels. Do not let the eight months between our stay and this review lead you to believe we are less than enthusiastic about our experience. The Toren ranks as perhaps the best hotel in which we have ever stayed for every reason important to travelers. The property itself is exquisite and has masterfully intertwined history and interior design with all the amenities expected at a first class hotel. The rooms were, as you have likely read, small but they are beautiful, comfortable, and a treat to come back to after a long day in the city...and book a room with a canal view - it makes the room. The charm of the hotel is that it sits amongst the homes of Amsterdamers on the Keizersgracht, just steps away from the Westerkerk, Anne Frank Huis, and outstanding restaurants. When coming and going from the Toren, you feel more like you are visiting someone's home than a hotel -- no elevators, overdone lobbies, or tourists milling about. Beautiful hotel in an excellent location - but what about the service? Well, to say the least, the service was outstanding. The staff is warm and inviting -- whether it was at check-in, during breakfast, each day when we asked for advice on dinner, or when we wanted an amazing cappucino at the bar, we were always treated like guests, not people they were paid to serve. As foodies, we give the front desk staff an A+ on recommendations. Amsterdam is a melting pot of cultures so every day we had amazing dinners from around the world - Indian, Spanish, Italian, Indonesian, and yes, Dutch - and all within a 5 minute walk from the hotel.

Now, I've never thought of myself as an uptight American, but maybe I am more than I realized. So I thought I'd pass on a couple of bits of information in case they weigh into someone else's decision-making. First of all, the only thing that was enclosed in our room was the toilet. The sink, the bathtub, the shower, were all in the main room. So the only privacy you had was when you were in the toilet closet. This may not matter at all to some people, but it might to others. And they may have rooms that aren't like this but it's worth checking on. The second thing is they have all of these huge artistic photographs on the wall, and it wasn't until we were lingering over breakfast that we got to looking at them closer. That's when we saw the handcuffs on the blurred arm on a rumpled bed. And as we looked at the other photographs throughout the lobby, they were all along the same theme.

Kind enthusiastic staff making suggestions for things we had not thought of or were unaware of. Spectacular reception area and bar, all rich Rococo style. We got suite 406, with an equally spectacular Rococo style finish of the room: gold ornaments on the ceiling, a beautiful chandelier, fire place area, sitting area by the windows, antique desk next to the entrance. Lot of 'walking around' space. Wonderful king size bed which has the matrass as it should be: ONE large matrass rather than 2 x 1 pers matrasses with the break in the middle (don't understand why other hotels still do that). So Great! Then downstairs... yes, split level. A bathroom beyond imagination. Upon entrance, against the right side 2 beautiful spacious sinks, to the left first a walk in shower with multiple showers, next to it a large jacuzzi and behind the back wall of the jacuzzi the toilet. The bathroom alone is just as big as some of the hotel rooms we stayed in in the past, excellent!

One expects good service from staff at meals and in the bar, but this team had the right mix of attentiveness, skill, and unobtrusiveness, to make our experience very comfortable.

They did it out of kindness and concern, as one would have for a friend or family member. \u00c2\u00a0My wife and I have stayed at good hotels and B & Bs, and we have stayed at great ones...but never have we experienced a hotel staff that was so human, so capable, and so kind.

After having good experiences at hostels throughout Europe, and this being a very busy business trip with 12-hour days working at the University, I decided to save a little money and rented a room at a hostel in central Amsterdam about 5 blocks from the central train station. This hostel will not be named but will receive a review from me. I (a female) was put in a room with 5 males. Foolishly, I assumed that they had their rooms segregated by sex. In any case, I thought this would be okay... it was really not okay. Aside from having to get up early in the morning to a room of steamy, boozy breath, I was in a top bunk that made loads of noise when rising. Upon arriving back at 10pm after my first full 12-hour day, I found that the hostel staff seemingly arbitrarily moved me to a different room, when I was told that I would not be moved unless I wanted to. They denied this. I was moved to a room at the back of the hostel that looked out onto a busy and loud walking street, the room was not cleaned, had open bottles of alcohol, empty pizza boxes laying around. When I tried to have a conversation with the staff, they became loud, hostile, rude, dominating and unapologetic. They attempted to make me feel that I signed off on this type of arrangement, and should have expected this. I demanded and got my money back, got my money back and called a taxi. Somehow, fortunately, I wound up with Vincent Versteeg as a taxi driver, and told him that I needed to find a place quickly. I told him that I did not want to be around partying, in thick clouds of marijuana smoke and people up until all hours. I told him that the last time I was in Amsterdam, I stayed at a very nice (and not terribly cheap) hostel that was near the Anne Frank House. ARRIVING AT THE TOREN!! I named Vincent my angel, because he brought me to The Toren. It was well after midnight. I met the lovely Wendy at reception. Wendy was so helpful and cheerful that I immediately felt myself calming down, when an hour before I was in tears, and also still horribly jet-lagged, knowing that I had to be at work the next morning at 9am. They had a small one bedroom only for one night, and I took it immediately. The room was absolutely beautiful, the bed was heavenly and the bathroom was completely updated and after washing up I felt very pampered. All of this was amazing, particularly for the price. Everyone that I met on that one night and beyond (continue reading) was so helpful and friendly and there was no pretense in any of the employee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviors. The next morning, since I only had the room for one night, I had to pack up again, and was dreading having to look for another place to stay somehow during my 12-hour work day. Checking out, I mentioned my dread, and Anouk and Christy at reception very quickly pieced together a reservation for me that included two different rooms. One standard double, and then for my remaining time, a small single, like what I originally had. Again, I felt immense relief. Not only that: all of my bags were moved for me when I had to move rooms. From the time that I arrived and every night following, the entire staff including: Wendy, Christy and Anouk as mentioned above, Ger, Thomas, Yassar, Sebastian, Marina and Danielle all treated me as a friend, if not family. This is a very good feeling as a female traveling alone. I have stayed at many hotels and have traveled extensively, but have never encountered this kind of genuine kindness and hospitality. After thinking about my experiences, I started thinking that the owners were very smart people, if not also extremely unconventional. I spoke again with Wendy, who incidentally mentioned that she has worked here for 10 years about my theory regarding the owners Eric and Petra Toren: that they had an incredible sense of social intelligence in hiring their staff. Wendy agreed. A day later I was fortunate to meet Petra and Eric. We spoke for about an hour, but only ten minutes into the conversation I realized that I was right. In a nutshell, Eric told me that he not only hires from the heart, hires people with heart. That is: people who are not only willing to be kind and gracious, but actually have a natural propensity to give generously and work together. There are numerous reviews of The Toren that speak to its incredible design, d\u00c3\u00a9cor, location and food. I agree with all of these. However, I am writing to speak of my human experiences here, experiences that were actually inspiring. As a professor, I am very used to contemplating how people interact, and am sensitive to these interactions. The type of management, the people, the experience that they created for me at The Toren was literally something that inspired me to the extent that I plan to write about the experience: I will be writing about the sort of care in management and human relations as something that is a dying art in our largely superficially-connected world today. So, what now?? My plan for after my week-long project at the University ended was to travel to one of the Frisian islands. But, in the end, because of my experience at The Toren, I have decided to stay here in Amsterdam at Sebastian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, another hotel owned by the Torens and just down the street. I have been to Texel in the past with a traveling partner, and in thinking about making the trip alone, I realized that I was nervous about possibly finding myself in another situation where I did not feel comfortable or even safe. So, I am staying here, with family \u00e2\u02dc\u00ba Thank you to everyone at The Toren! PS. And yes, it is all exquisitely beautiful, mindfully decadent and gorgeous.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWe stayed in the Garden Cottage and loved it\u201d", "Author": "awestesq", "ReviewID": "UR115192178", "Content": "The room is a little small by American standards, but big enough for two.

The lounge (which doubles up as the breakfast area and bar is quite something. I felt lost in an era of Baroque oppulance and grandeur - I loved it. The rooms were beaturifully decorated, with plush towels, a spa bath and down bedding. The hotel is within VERY easy walking distance of all the major Amsterdam attractions. It is surrounded by many lovely restaurants. Right behind the Anne Frank House (a must see) and close to all the public transport stops. Although one of the claims ot fame is being situated in the \"Nege straatjes\"area, I personally found THAT to be overrated. If your time is limited, you can skip this and rather visit the many other fantastic sights in the area. I also found this hotel to be very good value for money ito European standards. The breakfast every morning was something short of a continental FEAST! And do treat yourself to a traditional Dutch meal at De Roode Kombuis\"just down the road from the hotel.

I have severe back issues and these beds were sheer heaven. We both slept like babies. The hotel is close enough to the city center, within walking distance, yet far enough to not be disturbed by any night life noise. We were never disturbed by any outside noise.

The Hotel was as described, and photographed, on its website. Beautifully decorated room (we were in 412 - which was a few yards down the road from the main reception desk and other part of the Hotel), fantastic bathroom - Vileroy & Boch fittings - flat screen TV, Nespresso coffee machine, safe (no charge). Went for a slightly bigger deluxe bedroom - which slept 3, even though there were only 2 of us. Room wasn't huge, but big and comfortable enough for its purpose which was somewhere to lay a weary head after a lot of walking around the City. The Hotel is fabulously located - just a couple of canal bridges from Dam Square, and about 10 minute walk from Centraal Station. 1 minute walk to Anne Franks Museum (House), and the next door Westerkerk Tower (well worth the climb for the views). Staff were attentive and helpful - from reception to bar, and recommend an evening nightcap in their lounge, complete with Music (&/or football!) TV, and a chess board to end the evening on a competitive edge. Would recommend nearby Restaurant, which is actually affiliated to the nearby Pulitzer Hotel - so didn't feature on the Toren's recommended list of nearby Restaurants, but it's at 238 Keizersgracht - so just a few doors down, on the corner. Excellent food for an evening meal - not the cheapest! Also dined at Toscanini - need to book in advance (internet bookings available via their website) - local Italian, again within a short walk from the Hotel. The Hotel is far enough away from the Red Light District (which is walkable) and in a much nicer, and quieter, part of town than the other side of Dam Square. Dam Square itself is less than a 5 minute walk from the Hotel's front door. This Hotel has clearly had a lot of thought and attention put into its decor - which is in keeping with the style of the building; traditional and atmospheric, but with modern fittings and amenities. Well worth a stay - and cheaper than the larger \"business style\" Hotels. Wi-fi available in bedrooms, via the TV or your own laptop - may be a small charge, our porter said it was free in the room, but the TV indicated a charge of EURO 8 for 24 hours access to the Wi-Fi - so we were not entirely sure which applied, but as we intended to do no business and it was purely a leisure trip, we didn't bother finding out!

My room was in the annex, which is several doors down from the main building that houses both the reception as well as the dining room. The Toren is in a what appears to be a residential area right on the Keizersgracht ... one of the major canals that ring the Amsterdam. The two buildings appear to be townhomes that was converted to a hotel. I had a room on the fourth floor, and I think I was upgraded to a canal view room. The decor and furnishings are rich and classical ... maroon velvet furniture abound, and even the rooms are framed with crown moulding and a chandelier. My room was a nice size as a single traveler and I would consider it average sized for a European hotel room. The bathroom was a surprise because it had a combo shower and jacuzzi tub. Frankly, the jacuzzi seemed a little unnecessary for such a little bathroom, but it was a nice touch. The service is what set this hotel apart. I arrived at the hotel at about 9:00AM, after having taken the Thalys from Brussels to Amsterdam. I had just expected to drop my bags off so that I could go have breakfast and explore the city until check-in time. The reception offered breakfast, and I had initially refused because I just didn't want to have a hotel breakfast. I had misunderstood, because they were offering breakfast to me for free. That was a really nice start. Breakfast was a hot buffet breakfast, with wonderfully polite service. From start to finish, the staff all were helpful, exhbiting true hospitality ... I felt like a guest in their house. In terms of location, I was initially hesitant because it seemed a little off the beaten path. Don't let the location on the map fool you ... it's close enough to the big tourist sights, while being far enough away that you feel like you can explore the \"real\" Amsterdam. The Anne Frank house is around the corner, and the very interesting district of Jordaan is right nearby. The Amsterdam Centraal station is a fifteen minute walk for a fast-walking urban dweller, so everything is very accessible by foot. What's great about being in a residential area is that you can explore restaurants, cafe's and bars that have a nice local/tourist mix. And it's wonderfully quiet at night, except for the church bells of the Westerkirk which ring all day and all night long ... it's a lovely auditory frame for an European city. If you want to explore further, the tram is less than two blocks away. Since it's not a big hotel, the amenities are at a smaller scale. There's a restaurant lounge that might seat 20 (and that would feel crowded) where breakfast and cocktails are served. There's also free internet here, so if you need to connect come here instead of paying in your room. The next time I'm in Amsterdam (and I hope to return!) I will definitely be back over the big luxury chains.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cgreat stay at the toren\u201d", "Author": "one80", "ReviewID": "UR89773654", "Content": "We just returned from a long weekend at the Toren in Amsterdam.

We got all that at a reasonable cost (we stayed a full week, warranting a \"special\" price, and we split costs) PLUS the great pleasure of the Toren's superb hospitality.The entire staff, from the front desk to the bar/breakfast lounge, to the maids, were all amazingly friendly and helpful, and made us feel entirely welcome and at home. To examplify how completely thoughtful they are to the needs of hotel guests....in the front hall of the main building as well as the nearby second building where we stayed, sits an umbrella stand with several large, strong umbrellas, available to any guest who needs one. In the month of November, when the winds and rain kick up, it's a great convenience. We came with pocket-sized versions that didn't hold up; we were so appreciative to be able to borrow The Toren's umbrellas. How trusting and thoughtful! I must add that the hotel is beautiful - ornate, but lovely - and the breakfast buffet is outstanding; delicious, fresh food, eggs or pancakes to order if you wish, and heavenly coffee. It was tough coming home and having to prepare my own morning food.

It was worth paying that little bit extra for for a special weekend. We also booked the champagne on arrival package for 60 euros which was well worth it. We had a bottle of Moet, chocolates and strawberries in our room for arrival and also breakfast in our room on the 1st morning. The hotel advised to use the TCM taxis from the station to the hotel which would cost 7,50, however we took the first taxi (which wasnt a TCM) and he charged us 15 eurors (our own fault). So just be aware and make sure you see the TCM sign on the taxis. The hotel will always use them when booking taxis for you. On arrival the staff were very welcoming and we had a cocktail in the bar while we waited to be shown to our room. Marney (I hope thats how it's spelt) was really nice and a great cocktail maker. When we went to pay they said we didn't have to, a welcome drink :-) We were shown to our room which it outside the hotel because its in the garden - in a lovely large garden area thats also home for the staff. The room was amazing, very romantic/gothic kind of feel, lots of cosy velvet curtains. The biggest and most comfiest bed, seperate area with desk and table. The internet is not free however there are a few options and I went for the wired option which was 8 euros for 24 hours which wasn't too bad. The double jacuzzi bath in the room is just bliss, plenty room for 2. There is a great shower too with a steam setting however we never did work this one out. Lots of lovely towels and toiletries in room. There is a lovely garden area outside the room but the weather wasnt the best when we were there but I cam imagine in the summer it would be lovely to sit out. There is a mini bar in the room but the only alcoholic drinks in it are beer, the rest are soft drinks and snacks but not too expensive. We had a few drinks in the hotel bar, amazing cocktails and not too expenisve. 13 euors for a vodka & orange and a jack daniels & coke. The bar is open until 1am but they staff say they will serve you normal drinks (i.e. not cocktails) any time of the night. They also serve bar snacks, like olives, soup, panninis etc. The location is perfect, we walked everywhere, close to all parts of Amsterdam you'd want to visit.

I know I am raving, but the best part of the whole experience was the staff. They were the most attentive and helpful I have ever encountered. In the evening upon our return, they would position two comfortable chairs in front of the fire for us in the bar. They made every reservation we needed for dinners and events.

We did not have any views from our windows but we didn't even notice. It wasn't as issue. There are phones in the roooms, intercoms, TV and computers which you can pay to use. My 18 year old did . We paid extra for the breakfast which was well worth it and very delicious. We enjoyed everything about the hotel and the staff. The girls in the front office were exceptionally helpful while booking our rooms from Australia and during our stay. Robert organised our pushbikes for us. Which I also recommend using. We had so much fun with those, riding all around the city and then through the redlight district at midnight. The AnneFrank House was a highlight for us too. Don't miss it.( very short walk form the hotel) I highly recommend this beautiful boutique hotel. We can't wait to go back! Don't try to get the train or tram from the airport, we did and we made it but with only 2 days in Amsterdam we did regret the time wasted trying to find our way at the airport. Taxi would have been much better. We were cranky , hot and tired when we arrived. Thank goodness for Robert! P.S Every street corner looks the bloody same so if you are first timers it takes a bit of getting used to. Don't be scared of the bikes , they made it so much better for us.", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in Fabulous Location\u201d", "Author": "LoriCarMontreal", "ReviewID": "UR81595355", "Content": "Great hotel in a fabulous location.

The Toren's location is perfect--on a quiet part of a canal street, in easy walking distance of attractions or tram stops. We were so pleasantly surprised by the appearance of the hotel. Situated in an old canal house, the decor is baroque. A bit over the top in some parts, but the overall effect is far more luxurious and visually satisfying than the concept-less, bare bones style of many other places we've stayed. The standard double room was a bit small, as most hotel rooms in Amsterdam tend to be, but it was SO comfortable! A complimentary in room Nespresso machine was the perfect amenity after a day of walking the city. The bed was so comfortable to cuddle up in that one afternoon after being caught in the rain we came back to change and got so comfortable that we cuddled up, ordered room service, and watched a movie instead. The bathroom was new, modern, immaculate. Above and beyond that, the staff were friendly and courteous--also not typical in Amsterdam.

Our room was in a different building, down the street, but that wasn't a problem as reception took care of our bags. The hotel next to the second Toren building is being totally renovated so I was worried that it would be noisy in our room, but as is was in the back we hardly heard a thing. The room was BEAUTIFUL! Very big with a huge bed and great Jacuzzi. A warning though....10 mins after the Jacuzzi is emptied it makes a bit of noise for a few mins (I think that it has fans that dry all the excess water....very state of the art!). The staff are wonderful. They really do everything to make your stay special. Everyone is bi or tri-lingual. I heard one waiter switch between Dutch, English and Spanish. Breakfast is delicious.

Thankfully that was an atypical experience and everyone else from bellboy to bartender was very kind and helpful.

We decided to book through a travel agent (who was excellent), and she had us stay at the Toren in Amsterdam, our first city of the trip. We arrived at the Toren early in the morning, because our flight came in at 7 am. Our room was not ready, but we expected that to be the case. To pass time, we decided to explore Amsterdam, and immediately, the front desk staff were helping us get our bearings, making suggestions and really making us feel comfortable in the city. The hotel's location is perfect. It is on a nice, mellow canal, but just a few blocks from the hustle and bustle of city center. It is walking distance from everything, and close to many private homes, with niche restaurants, cafes, boutiques, and local flavor peppered throughout the neighborhood. When we returned to the Toren, we were offered a drink before heading to our room. The bar in the hotel, along with the sitting/dining room is really well designed. It is a perfect mix of old world (as in castle) furniture with a fresh, modern feeling. I can't say enough about the friendliness of the people that worked at the hotel. Anyway, they had us follow the bellman to our room, and it was way, way, way better than we could have ever anticipated. It was probably the most unique and relaxing hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. With direct access to the courtyard, our room was fully loaded with a huge bed with a ton of soft and fluffy pillows, a giant jacuzzi tub, high-tech steam shower, cappuccino/espresso machine, flat-screen tvs, and even a bottle of champagne and some other goodies. It was the perfect environment for us to relax, unwind and retire to after explorations in such a neat and unique city. The question I always ask myself after exploring a new city or place: \"Will I go back?\" I can say that the comfort offered by this boutique hotel, the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff, location and overall experience of staying at this place added a ton of value to our trip and helped to make Amsterdam stand out in my head as one of the most friendly, fun and interesting cities in the world. Will I go back? Absolutely! I would recommend anyone traveling to Amsterdam to spend their nights at the Toren Hotel. I've found \"my spot\" for sure.

The rooms are very comfortable, and the single rooms are large by European standards with oversize single beds.

The rooms are also clean, have an espresso machine in each room, and also have internet available for a small fee. The rooms are a bit dark, but not bad - it is really relaxing. Be aware that there are no elevators (at least not in the Annex), and the stairs are narrow given the building style. The location can not be beat - 5 minute walk to the Anne Frank House, and 10 minute walk to Dam Square, Centraal Station and Royal Palace. Very easy to get a tram to anywhere you want to go within a 5 minute walk. The hotel is on a quaint canal, and the area is not noisy like the hotels on Dam square.

At the night of my check-in, there was a gentleman (Peter) and a lady who gave me a very warm welcome and addressed me by name before I had a chance to state it myself; they were expecting me. My first ever visit to Netherlands thus started on a note of warm hospitality. What a great way to make a guest's introduction to one's country! Unfortunately, I had lost my travel bag on way to the hotel, on the street somewhere. The staff filed a report on my behalf to the tram service as well as the police. I didn't have to deal with any hassle. Kudos to their staff! The hotel has a feeling of grand decor on a smaller scale (size of rooms isn't too large). It is done with a lot of taste and all supplies are good. There is also a private locker for which the guest sets their own password. There is internet available for 8 Euros a day. My room was facing the garden at the back. The hotel is located on the route of the tram service and is very convenient. It is one block away from the famous Anne Frank house (now a Museum). I could hear the bell of the old church ring in the distance; the same bell that Anne used to hear as she recounted in the diary. There was an air of spiritual serenity to it and was a profound experience! The hotel's bar has a real fireplace and plush interior. It is very stylish. It is open until 1 at night. Even if you don't feel the urge to drink, just go and sit there late at night to reflect on the happenings of the day. It is very cozy. One tip to keep in mind: my room did have some smell of smoke from the previous guest.

On reviewing the photos on The Toren's site I was immediately taken by the combination of the elegance of the rooms and guest lounge and the modernity of the amenities offered. A map of Amsterdam suggested the hotel was fairly close to the rail station and other attractions so I booked a room with a double jacuzzi for three nights. On arriving in Amsterdam I discovered The Toren was about a 10 minute walk from the train station and within easy walking distance of all the major sites and attractions. The hotel is located along one of Amsterdam's canals, the exterior very well kept like the neighbouring buildings which provided a great selection of architectural types. Notwithstanding the central location, there was little traffic or noise. The lobby and guest lounge were immaculately clean with a feel of elegance. The staff were, without exception, very pleasant and helpful and appeared genuinely concerned with my comfort. Check-in was a breeze and I was soon ensconced in the the hotel's excellant lounge and bar, tended again by very helpful and friendly staff and supplied not only with some excellant Heineken but a very good selection of wine and champagne. My room was absolutely beautiful coloured in a striking black and red motif with a very comfortable king sized bed, all the usual amenities, a large jacuzzi and marble walk in shower. The Toren does not have a restaurant of its own although an excellant breakfast boasting a wide selection of hot and cold items, fruits, cereals etc. is available daily and the hotel does have an arrangement with, if memory serves, two or three local restaurants and limited room service is available. Anyway, after spending my first night in Amsterdam and enjoying The Toren's hospitality, I completely reorganized my holiday and extended my stay, in large part due to the hotel's comfort, a further 5 nights. The Toren is a first class hotel at less than first class prices and, in my view, worth every Euro. I am looking forward to my next stay. So, should you find yourself in Amsterdam needing a little pampering and comfort give The Toren a try.", "Date": "April 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "paris_1204", "ReviewID": "UR26475906", "Content": "After looking at many reviews here and because the hotel offered some excellent low rates for our stay (more than 50% less) we decided to book The Toren. We loved the location which is just three tram stops from Centraal Station (Westermarkt stop) and the staff were all very patient, kind and welcoming. We were happy to have an overnight away from our terrible Paris hotel whose staff were so unwelcoming to us. The hotel is right around the corner from the Anne Frank House and is short (15 minutes) walking distance from the Dam Square, Red Light district, Kalverstraat shopping, the flower market, and more. We had their buffet breakfast (12 euro/pp) and it was very good. There were pastries, breads, fresh fruit salad, cereals, eggs, ham, sausage, etc. They offer an in room internet for 8 euro/day not per hour as that Paris hotel we booked. They also have a 20 euro/day combination package including the internet, movies, and games. Since we there for one night we booked a regular double with bath and shower (Room 116) for a low rate of 115 euro. The room, like the entire hotel, is decorated in black and red something like a boudoir. The hotel is a boutique hotel and while the room size was a bit small it was okay as it had room for a little sofa. The bathroom was extra small yet it was equipped with a very nice bathtub with rainshower and shower curtain. The toiletries were good (Rituals). However, I must say there some minuses with the room. First of all, the a/c is not available and it was a bit warm; the front desk said they could turn off the heat in order for us to get the a/c. We could open the windows but the room overlooked the back of the hotel's interior but had a set of steps that made the room accessible to anyone if they had wanted to enter. The bathroom had just one narrow shelf space so anything more than the two glasses and a couple of small items there was no place to rest one's personal items. The floor is a black smooth granite or tile and there is no rug so the floor gets wet from the small sink where water is easily splashed out of. The bathroom floor is a slight step up from the bedroom floor so one has to remember this or one can easily trip and fall badly. The room lighting is not good for reading also. But I must say that to me after reading the many mixed hotel reviews for other hotels here The Toren is really a good choice and I would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "March 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frozen North", "Title": "\u201cGreat location with friendly helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "Trekmates", "ReviewID": "UR26328925", "Content": "My other half and I were in desperate need of a romantic break together, away from all the stresses of modern life, and The Toren seemed the ideal location to take her on a surprise long weekend (3 nights).

Without any pretensions, your hosts make you feel comfortable within opulent, though slightly theatrical surroundings. Our room (109), with massive Jacuzzi bath within the room, separate shower and WC along with a delightfully enticing bed, was a pleasure to occupy. The stained glass window added a real sense of history to the room. Breakfast was a typical continental affair with a good selection and eggs to order were available. Coffee or tea was waiter served. There is no restaurant at the hotel but they do serve a range of snacks / light meals and they can order you in food should you chose, which can be taken in the dinning area or in the privacy of your room. They even have an arrangement with an upmarket Michelin rated French restaurant which is just around the corner to deliver food. We ate out each evening and took the advice of the reception staff on two nights which proved to be spot on (Paso Doble [Tapas] and Long Pura [Indonesian]). The hotel bar is cosy and perfect for enjoying a drink or two! Give the Heineken Extra Cold a try. The hotel has a good canal side location in the more peaceful part of Amsterdam but yet still within easy walking distance of most places you may wish to visit.

This could result either in the place looking like a whore house, or extremely dramatic and spectacular, and luckily, The Toren landed on the last result. The hotel is relatively small, situated in a quiet area not far from Anne Franks House and The Nine Streets, so a LOT of interesting shops nearby. The hallways in the hotel are dark, and decorated lavishly to the point of almost ridiculous, EVERYTHING is glossy finishes, velvet, cut-glass, chandeliers and huge fake flower arrangements. The rom wasn't VERY big, but very well-equipped, with flatscreen tv with cable (and several english language stations), an ipod docking station, a complimentary nespresso machine, and a huge bathroom, actually almost the same size as the rest of the room. The bathroom was just closed off from the rest of the room by a curtain, but had a large shower with a rainfall showerhead, and the biggest jacuzzi i have ever seen in a bathroom. The jacuzzi had several programs,and built-in colored lights. Oh yes. We were happy to find that despite the whole curtain-scenario, the toilet was shielded by a door.

The bed was extremely comfortable, VERY big and had lots of pillows and cushions. If you go for the look that this hotel has chosen, wear and tear IS going to show, but why mope about the fact that there are some scratches in the wallpaper, if you look closely? I prefer to focus on the point of thoughtful and luxurious complementaries, such as the Nespresso machine, and some extremely nice toiletries, by Rituals.

The Netherlands The Toren Hotel. September 8th to 12th.2008. I arranged this trip as a surprise birthday present for my wife's 60th birthday. After searching the websites I chose The Toren because it had all the special features I was looking for. Ann's birthday was 6th September but I told her the news the day before! That was a good move because Ann was able to share it with her father who was ill in hospital. Sid was so keen for Ann to enjoy the trip. Tragically Sid died on Sunday morning the 7th. It was a tough call but with the family's support we set off via Eurostar from London through Bruxelles. Feeling tired and emotionally drained we arrived to find The Toren Hotel in an ideal quiet and peaceful location. The staff, on hearing our news were absolutely magnificent. They could not have been kinder or more compassionate. To our surprise and delight there was champagne awaiting us to celebrate Ann's birthday. The room was delightful - the jacuzzi such a wonderful aid to alleviate the stress and strain we both felt. The whole ambience of the hotel was excellent. Breakfast was truly great and exactly what was required. The Toren was in just the right location for us to enjoy the canals, the museums, the park and the local restaurants. In addition to the champagne on our arrival the staff arranged for food to be delivered to save us having to go out to find a restaurant. Later in our stay we were delighted again with the gift of strawberries and chocolates. The fire in Eurotunnel on 11/12 September made us feel marooned! Yet again the staff were so helpful and considerate.

Facilities included a coffee making machine with various complimentary coffees, mini bar, broadband access (via your own laptop or via the TV), air conditioning, great lighting with dimmer controls and the lovely double Jacuzzi with various settings and coloured lighting.

When he returned he apologised for the delay, took our order and then said they were complimentary drinks as an apology for the delay (we had not mentioned that we had been waiting).

The room had a safe, refrigerator, robes and slippers and the bathroom was a decent size and recently renovated. I was very pleased with the accomodations. The annex should be considered- it is quiet and convenient and apparently the superior rooms are a bit larger than the main building. The breakfast was excellent with a large variety of foods.

I would stay at the Toren without hesitation in a heartbeat!! Some restaurants that I would recommend, they are excellent but not inexpensive: Brasserie Harkema, 11, and Restaurant Luwte (Toren). Amsterdam is a beautiful, relaxed, and friendly city. I am in my fifties and my friend and I rented bikes and rode all over the city- it's the best way to get around. The toren recommends Bike City.

On arrival you will be surprised at the lovely decor of the ground floor, not to mention the warmth and charm of the friendly staff who greet you (they even went to the trouble of sorting out the complex car parking fees for overnight parking on the canal side, insisting on walking across the canal with me in the snow to make sure I paid the right fees and did not get a ticket). On being shown to our room we where again surprised at its elegance. Combining a mixture of modern technology - flat screen tv, wi-fi, etc - with an opulent decor of satins, silks, fluffy cushions and warm colours. The effect instantly took the chill of an Amsterdam December evening from your bones, as if the 19th & 21st centuries had collided to produce an oasis of charm in the desert of winter. Changing after a hot shower in the spacious and well designed bathroom we where thus well prepared to enjoy the delights of Amsterdam, returning in the early hours when we were encouraged by the ever so friendly night porter to enjoy a night cap in the spacious bar area.

The staff seemed genuinely sorry to see you depart, wishing you bon voyage as you left and hoping that you would return some day.

The hotel was walkable from the train station, about 10-15 minutes and is a great way to immediately get a sense of the neighborhood in which you will be staying. The staff checked us in promptly and the bellman took our bags up to the second floor. I didn't see an elevator during our stay and we were always using the stairs, so not sure if there is one. Both desk agent and bellman were friendly and helpful, so no issues here. Room #115 was at the back of the hotel. They call this the \"quiet side\" of the hotel. Which is really just a way of saying there is no view, unless you count the skylight of the kitchen below, a view. The room was decorated nicely with nice deep red colors and fluffy down comforters. It looked a bit like a brothel, which I thought was kind of interesting, considering the city we were in. It felt cozy, very small, but cozy. I have stayed at a variety of hotels in Europe and this one is smaller than most. I wondered why there was so much furniture in the room, (bed, 2 chairs, desk, 2 nightstands and table), which only made it seem smaller. Maybe if it was cleared out a bit it would have felt larger. The bathroom was a great size, with plenty of room and all the normal amenities to keep you from bringing your entire bathroom. My favorite feature in the room was the coffee maker. This might seem a bit trivial, but, as an American travelling to Europe, one of the things I really enjoy is great coffe almost everywhere you go and it was nice to have a \"proper\" coffee maker in the room. It was a \"Nespresso\" machine that could brew you espresso, coffees and teas. Easy to use with a lot of selections! Breakfast was \"ok\", very standard fare for a European Hotel. Pastries, juices, meats and cheeses. Although the chef/cook, did come out to each table to ask if there was anything additional or special he could prepare, that was not already out on the buffet. The hotel staff were friendly enough, although I get a feeling they were not completely happy with Americans. I am very sensitive to this subject, as it comes up often enough, lately, while travelling in Europe, so I am careful to be, almost over courteous, and still felt a bit affected by the overall attitude. The best reason to stay at this hotel is the location. Situated outside the city center, you are close enough to walk to all attractions, but still able to enjoy the \"quietness\" and \"local\" feel to the area. There are a few Dutch restaurants on the hotels, recommendation list and found two of them to be outstanding. The \"De Reiger\" and \"Clais Claisz\", hope I am remembering these correctly, were outstanding, with De Reiger being the better of the two.

It is worth knowing that we were there from a Mon - Wed so that may have had something to do with the amount of food available coming up to the 11.00am mark ... Overall though, I would say that the hotel was a nice, friendly, place to stay. Overpriced somewhat but I think this can be made up for by the unusual decor, which for me is important. Bedclothes matching paintings matching curtains is not something I like to pay for. Toren is not this.

So, I checked out the price of the suite on the Internet, then contacted the hotel via e-mail for their rate (hoping since we were booking a 7-night stay, I could negotiate a bit of a discount from the internet price - then plus the tourbook discount. I figured, can't hurt to ask.) The hotel staff readily responded with a rate higher than quoted on the internet. When I brought this fact to their attention, they agreed to hold the room for me, and to discuss the discrepancy with Mr. Toren, to see what would be a fair rate. So, even if I'd wanted to book at the first internet rate, I couldn't. I did not hear back from them for weeks (despite a quick reminder a few days after our initial contact), at which time, the hotel was able to honor the initial internet rate.

It was very relaxing to return to the hotel to warm up and revatilise ourselves with a drink in their cosy bar with the added bonus of a fire. The staff were excellent, very helpful, gave good advise on where to eat and booked trips for us. This was a positive experience as most hotels we have stayed in the staff are \"too busy on their computers\" to spend any genuine time chatting to guests. We weren't disappointed with our bedrooms as thanks to your site we were fore warned that they were small, they were very elegant, beautifully decorated and cleaned every day. Shopping advise- stay away from the big malls like \"The Magna Plaza\" and \"De Bijenkorf\" tres expensive. I found a very good dept store on Dam Square \"Peek & Cloppenburg\" good quality clothes, reasonable price and helpful staff. We visited the Irish bar \"O'Reilly's\" and while we enjoyed our visit we were charged 10 euro for a pot of tea and a pot of hot water to top up. A bit of a rip off for a pub claiming to be an Irish bar. We found a lovely short cut home back to the hotel over four bridges/canals away from the main thorough fare and you felt you were heading into the real Amsterdam. We walked every where and when we felt weary we hopped on a tram and found the drivers very willing to set you on the right track. We found everyone from hotel staff, tram drivers, restaurant staff, shop assistants, tour guides etc. very courteous and helpful. We felt that we were very lucky that we booked to stay in the Toren I think our break would not have been as enjoyable if we stayed at a big impersonal hotel.

Do not book this suite if you have trouble with stairs. Bath linens were very high quality. Location is quite good on a very lovely canal, very close to Anne Frank's house and the Westerkirk.

Toren is part of the Canal House hotel and shares the bar/breakfast room. Aside from those two very elegant rooms, the hotel is pretty much a 1 - 2 star flop house. Our room, which had an extra bed added, was extrremely small and did not allow for any space to put our luggage. Even with three in the room it would have been too small. There was no A/C and the bathroom was really quite grungy. The hotel is close to Ann Frank House and within easy walking distance of the Dam and the museum district, but these are not good enough reasons to stay here. From what I saw, the Canal House was not much better. The staff was indifferent, at best, and truly not interested in us. On a related note, I have to say how dejected we were with Amsterdam in general. Having been there some ten years ago were were really looking forward to exposing our children to what used to be a vibrant, beautiful city. Sadly, it is nothing of the sort anymore. Drugs (pot and magic mushrooms) are king now, with prostitution running a close second. At one time it was a chore to find the famed \"brown cafes\" that sell marijuana. Now these \"coffeehouses\" are on virtually every street corner, and so too are the legions of stoned \"drug tourists\" that go with them. Moreover, it seemed that the entire city was under construction - even the museums which were very disappointing since so many exhibits were closed. I hate to say this, but we were even disappointed by Ann Frank House - sacred ground indeed, but badly in need of work.

We've stayed in hotels all over Europe and experienced the often weak air conditioning and we were pleasantly surprised that the AC at Toren was powerful and kept our room cool. We normally don't care about hotel bars, but this bar was charming. The bartender was friendly and chatty but above all the prices were reasonable and we were pleasantly surprised by the bar tab at the end of our stay. We also made a couple of international and were charged a very reasonable rate. The only drawback was that by being in the second house, we felt a bit cut off from the main house and the bar, which was probably a minor inconvience all things considered.
