The hotel is an old house or group of houses. Its nicely done in a traditional manner. The staff are very helpful. Breakfast is expensive at 19 euro. On our first morning we decided to look elsewhere and ended up at a pancake house. We saved a little but not enough to make us do it again the next day. So we tried the buffet in the hotel. There was a good mix of things to eat/drink so if your not worried about the cost its better to eat at the hotel.

The hotel itself is fine - the rooms are nice and warm but we were slightly dissapointed that the double room was in fact 2 single beds pushed together with 2 seperate sets of bed covers - hence a twin room with the beds moved next to each other - not the last word in romance if you are planning a special weekend away. Staff at the hotel were friendly and overall it was a nice laid back place. The number 2 and 5 trams are very close by, and they will take you to the heart of the attractions quickly.

We decided against breakfast as we know these can be expensive and managed to find plenty of places to eat nearby with probably a little more atmosphere. We had a few drinks in the Bar but wine by the glass was extremely pricey.

I am sure if i had complained, they would have told me how to adjust the heating....its just that the radiators were cold and i could see now obvious ways of adjusting Extras such as tea and coffee are to be found above mini bar although they are a bit scant on the ground!. Hairdryer in bathroom was ok and soap/shampoo was adequate if not a little \"cheap\" but i would go there again....just for the location and its clean rooms and nice bed linen There was a bit of mould around shower (showere over bath...basic but worked) but nothing that would cause me to freak out!

We were allowed to keep our bags for 4+ hours after checking out (since we had our flight later in the evening). Whats great about this hotel is the location - its just bang in the middle of seemingly everything yet in a quite neighbourhood. You are about 3 mins from the Van Gogh museum, 3 mins from the Coster Diamond museum, 4 mins from the Rijks museum, 5-6 mins from the place where you can take the canal cruise and 6-7 minutes from the happening Leidseplein square. The room itself is small which isn't a big surprise if you are in Western Europe and the bathroom+toilet is just enough for one person. But, there is nothing to complain off here (other than the toilet itself which was pretty odd, have attached a pic). Internet is expensive - 17 Euros for 24 hours access at 1mbps speed (quite low of seeing any videos). The breakfast is the usual continental buffet. At 20 Euros per head, it seemed expensive.

And what it does not say anywhere is that the dinner venue is a good 15 minutes walk away. It was my intention to relax and have dinner in the hotel on our first evening after travelling. I cancelled the booking. The following day the hotel told me I would be charged for the dinner we did not have. It did offer pay for a taxi on another evening, but we had other plans for the remaining evenings.

Transportation to Amsterdam Central via the overland train was simple, and having purchased 72hr passes at the airport, we were clear to transfer onto the excellent tram service to our hotel. I had read from previous reviewers that tram numbers 5 & 22 would get us to the hotel, which proved to be 'on the nail'. Off the tram, a 2 minute walk and we were at the hotel. Reception was efficient and welcoming, and the superior rooms were definately worth the extra. My wife and I had a third floor room with large opening windows, which gave a feeling of spaceousness normally associated with a terrace or balcony. My daughter and her friend had aslightly smaller first floor room, but this time with french doors and a balcony. The rooms were clean and almost boutique style, with a good size bathroom and complimentary amenities. The location is only a pleasant 10mins or so from Dam Square (by tram), and there are numerous entertainment and dining locations along the route. We regularly hopped on and off the tram en route, simply to take in the street vendors and cafe's along the way. The hotel has a great policy of locking the entrance around 8pm, which adds to the feeling of security, though the area appeared clean and respectable throughout our visit. Entry is achieved by simply ringing the door bell, and 'hey presto', so long as your face is recognised by the duty personal. Daily service was efficient and punctual, and my request for a taxi retutrn to Schiphol was undertaken without any consequence, and cheaper than standard rates. The use of a Mercedes car is also a bonus, especially for the price paid (EU 35.00 flat rate for 4 persons). Overall a good hotel, good location and thoroughly enjoyable stay.

No double bed - just 2 beds pushed together, and the room was quite cramped (although was modern and well furnished to be fair). Bathroom was tiny as well - no bath, just a shower. We stayed there 1 night and decided to raise the issue with the reception staff. They explained that the standard rooms are quite small, however, we could upgrade to a business room for 15 euro per night, or a superior room which was much more. The lovely receptionist gave us a key to one of the empty rooms and we went and had a look. It was so much better! Lovely king-sized bed, larger room, much bigger bathroom with a bath. So we made the transfer next door to room 210. If you are travelling alone, the standard rooms would probably suit. However, if you are a couple, or used to larger rooms, a business or superior room would most definetely be better for you - so consider this when you are booking to avoid dissapointment. We absolutely loved our business room! We booked breakfast included in our stay. The breakfast was very nice. Quite a good choice, of contenental or cooked/hot breakfast. The breakfast room was nice too. What we did find though, is there is a younger, fair-haired guy working down there who we found incredibly surly. It was enough to put you off your breakfast. This guy could do with some serious customer service training. Why he woke up one morning and decided to work in the hospitality business is a wonder. Management of the Bilderberg - he is the only weak link in your staff - so please do something about this. I was also horrified to see him working behind the reception some of the time too - which may count for the bad reviews for the reception staff. Totally unfair for the other staff who are working hard to please everyone, and doing a great job. Another thing I would mention is that during the stay for 5 nights, I was never able to clearly identify who the duty manager was, so it gives the impression that there isn't one and the place is self managing. The other negatives would be, they need to consider providing wireless internet for their rooms which is reasonably affordable. The quality of this hotel is very good, and I would recommend it.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cShopping, Parks + Van Gough\u201d", "Author": "neverturnright", "ReviewID": "UR107307043", "Content": "Stayed for one night.

However, by European standards they're okay. You have to remember you're in the old part of town, in an old building and the size of the room is the payoff. The most important thing for me is that the hotel is clean and I can get a good sleep. My room was spotless; the bathroom pristine. Things are a little quaint - like the wall-mounted music player that's been mentioned - but don't let that put you off. The location is excellent - a quiet street yet just turn the corner and you're at the diamond museum and the Rijksmuseum. The room cost isn't cheap, but it isn't expensive either. I would caution that if you select a very cheap hotel in Amsterdam then be prepared for a something a little \"ropey\" - they're mostly still clean but very old fashioned and may be out of the way. I would happily return to the Bilderberg. It is excellent for sightseeing and was well positioned for my conference. The staff were polite, friendly and like most Dutch people speak excellent English. With regards to getting to the hotel I caught a shared taxi-bus from the airport which currently costs 15.5 euro single and 30 euro return. You'll share with up to seven others in a mini bus. That takes you from right outside the airport and drops you in front of the hotel - so if you're travelling in the evening then it's a great option (in the middle of the night you'll have to get a taxi though). You can prebook the shared taxi bus or get a ticket from tourist information at the airport. Some people also seemed to pay on the bus, though I was told you had to prebook. I caught a train from Central station back to the airport which is rapid and less than 5 euro. The downside is the location of Central station is a bit of a trek from the hotel - half an hour plus walk (?). If you plan well you could visit that part of town on your last day and then catch the train. Another alternative is the bus from outside the airport - I think it's the 197, which will bring you pretty close. To me, as a British person, Amsterdam seems expensive. You do get tea and coffee in the room, but as has been mentioned 19 euro per person for breakfast is pricey; and 5 euro for water in the room is very expensive. How could the Bilderberg be better? Free WiFi in the hotel would be great, but to be fair this isn't common in Amsterdam though is something we now expect in London... I'd say I'm a pretty fussy traveller who always stays in 4/5 star hotels, and I have honestly stayed in far worse 5 star hotels than this in terms of cleanliness, friendliness, sleep quality and location.

Located in three attached townhouses on a quiet residential street, away from the tumult of the Dam and the red light district. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one block to Museumsplein (Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk Museum, Concertgebouw) and one block in the other direction to PC Hooftstraat with its high-end retailers and a couple of nice restaurants. Everything else you want to see in Amsterdam is within walking distance, though the Central Station is a bit of a hike. We never used cabs (except to the airport) or even streetcars - we walked everywhere. Currently, the outside of the building is being painted and is covered with scaffolding - something they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell us when we reserved our room and is not mentioned on their website. However, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interfere with our stay. Our room, 405, faced the back with a quaint view of housetops. The room is tiny, and the bathroom even tinier. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a queen-sized bed that takes up practically the whole room and two people cannot pass each other in the remaining space. The bathroom is even smaller. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all very clean and once you visit the Anne Frank House, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain about cramped quarters. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coffee and tea in the room, one small closet, an old (not flat) TV, a small desk, and a wall-mounted CD player(!?!).

You can purchase museum tickets at the front desk, so no need to wait in lines when you get there. Because we were staying for six nights, we were able to negotiate a slightly lower rate, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still expensive like everything else in Amsterdam. At these prices, they should not be gouging you for things like a small bottle of water in the room (5 euros), 19 euros per person for breakfast (which we declined - go to Maxime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around the corner), a fee for internet use, even for the computer in the lobby if you just want to check in with the airlines. One perfunctory nod of homespun hospitality is a bowl of complimentary apples available all day at the reception desk. When we arrived, we took a cab from the airport to the hotel, which turned out to be about 50 euros with the tip. When we checked out, the receptionist said they could call a cab that would cost 35 euros to the airport. A nice new Mercedes showed up, but cost 42 euros excluding tip. The driver told us the hotel has not updated their fee schedule, and I tend to believe him.

The bar area is lovely to sit in and have drinks and so too is the terrace area. We had breakfast 1 of the mornings and it was really nice, 14 Euros, but you could eat and drink all you wanted.

Its not so small as it is not functional for your stay. I would stay there again and again and I cannot state the courtesy of the staff.

An excellent choice at breakfast of cooked food - sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs and hard boiled eggs - and a cold buffet with salads, sliced meats, cheeses and smoked salmon. A well appointed bar, with an outdoor area for warmer weather, is open from 10 am until midnight and serves light dishes which make up for the fact the Hotel has no Dining Room. On our first night we had excellent mushroom and tomato soup and pleasant pizzas. Nothing elaborate but sufficient. We found the staff pleasant and helpful. The reception conveniently sells tickets to both the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh which enable you to by-pass the queues at both museums. If you wish to go further afield they also sell the new Travel Cards - either 24 or 48 hour versions both of which give you unlimited travel on bus, tram and Metro. Warning - the next street, P.C. Hoofstraat, is the smart shopping street of Amsterdam so be careful about letting your wife/partner loose. Mine saw an admittedly lovely pair of knee high red boots, but they were hand made Italian boots so far from cheap! Nevertheless she left Amsterdam very happy. Drawbacks The Breakfast Room is in the basement and the elevator does not descend that far so you have to negotiate a couple of flights of stairs. Not a problem for the fit but for the disabled elderly,as we are, quite a problem. You can have room service but that adds another 5 euros to an already far from cheap breakfast at 19 euros or 15 euros if you sign up for breakfast every day you ar staying there. Verdict.

A nice bar for a cocktail or beer is Momo and is only about 10 minutes walk away from the hotel (head towards Liedesplein). A few tips... I would definitely recommend booking your tickets for the Anne Frank house online - saves the queuing. If you are into your cocktails and trying something a little bit different visit the House of Bols opposite the Van Gogh museum. Not only do you get a cocktail you also get to try some of the Bols liqueurs. The Canal Bus is an excellent way to see the city and you can hop on and off as you please.

Having said that, the size of the room (303) was not a problem, the room was very clean, modern and had a great boutiquey feel. The location is ideal in my opinion, its far enough out of the main centre (Dam Square) so its quiet at night but close to the excellent Rijksmuseum. Take trams 2 or 5 from Central Station to get to the hotel. The same trams can be picked up from the end of the street and will get you to Dam square in under ten minutes. The hotel can provide you with a Stippenkart which gives you 7 trips on the tram (or bus) for 8 euros. Also, the hotel will lend you a bike should you need one. We used bikes for the last two days and wish we'd done it right from the beginning. Believe me, i'm not a cyclist but i really enjoyed cycling in the nearby Vondel Park and going to the street market (mon - Fri 9-5pm) on Albert Cruyp Stratt. Also, get your museum tickets from the hotel. They get an allocation delievered each morning - so get to reception early. You will not have to queue. Last tip, make sure you book tickets to Anne Frank House online.

There were few restaurants nearby, however, which means you'll have to walk a bit more to get a taste of Amsterdam come dinner time. The main thing to be careful about regarding this hotel is that you should not let them stick you in Room 007. It is small, even by European standards, and right on the ground floor. The window overlooks the small outdoor seating area of the bar, as well. After traveling from the United States, we were jet-lagged and just wanted some sleep by the time 10pm local time came around. As you can imagine, the noise of conversation and laughter from the bar was somewhat aggravating. We would never have booked this room if we knew this room was not only on the ground floor but adjacent to the bar. This is not an issue of this being a cheaper room, either; it cost as much as other rooms in quieter parts of the building. Specify \"no 007\" when booking. I also felt that the hotel was a little too-expensive, as well, especially given the tiny room and the noise. I suppose the high cost of lodging is simply a function of Amsterdam, though.

In practical terms it is 2 minutes walk from the No 5 tram (Hobbemastraat stop) and about ten minutes from the nearest supermarket (on Van Baerlestraat). It is easy to get to from Centraal Station using the No. 5 tram. There is a good selection of restaurants and caf\u00c3\u00a9s nearby on Van Baerlestraat and lots of upmarket shopping around the corner on PC Hoofstraat. Staying here you are far enough out of the touristy city centre, but near enough (via tram) to get their quickly. The hotel itself is friendly, homely and well kept. However, if you like spacious lifts and big rooms, this is not the place to stay. The rooms are smallish, but comfortably furnished (great comfy bed) and the bathroom well equipped. The lift is tight. But that's so much of Amsterdam architecture for you. Stayed three nights and would go back without a doubt if in Amsterdam again. The reception staff were chatty and spoke great English (we didn't meet anyone in Amsterdam who didn't). Breakfast was a bit expensive at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19 each for the buffet, but the food and the selection was good. Foregoing breakfast in the hotel you could certainly get a cheaper breakfast down the road if you wanted. The neighbourhood appears superficially quiet and the roads leafy and quite lush. But each night there was always some strange noise on the road outside to wake us up. The neighbourhood is not noisy, but it seems that the sound travels upwards and is amplified by the design of the street. One night it was an over-excited football fan, another night some enthusiastic revellers, but it was all jolly and wasn't like a marauding army outside. There are no real 'facilities' at the hotel, bar a small 'spa' with a sunbed, steam room and jacuzzi. It cost about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30 for 90 minutes and I never saw anyone use it. So no complaints and many fond memories of a pleasant stay. On a previous trip to Amsterdam I stayed in the 'old centre' of the city close to Centraal Station in a modern big hotel.

An hour later into our first afternoon in Amsterdam and they can still not see really what our problem is !!! We were given 2 options by the manager : 1. They would try and check out availability at other hotels in the area or, 2. If we would agree to move to their sister hotel for Friday night and come back for the following 2 nights they would upgrade our room.

He is a fan of boutique hotels and this seemed like one of the nicer ones. Unfortunately, it is not quite as quirky as many boutique hotels, the style is quite bland. However, it's very smart and spotlessly clean. For some reason in the evenings the maid turns on the radio tuned to the Dutch equivalent of Capital Gold and leaves you an apple each (a ritual I had never seen before, but handy if you like Phil Collins and apples). It's also within spitting distance of the Rijks Museum and the Van Gogh museum. We stayed in one of the larger rooms (room number one) which was right on the street so got quite noisy on Friday night. I'd definitely recommend earplugs. It was quite roomy though, and the bathroom was lovely. The hotel has a small but attractive bar area and a sitting room. It also has a poky and dark breakfast room in the basement - it was a shame that we couldn't have had breakfast on the patio on a sunny morning. There is no real restaurant, but nearby streets are packed with great places to eat and drink. We stumbled across Witte Uyl (the White Owl) just around the corner on Franz Halsstraat 26, which is easily one of the best restaurants we have ever been to, in any country, ever. Amazing food (Gordon Ramsay has a few things to learn from this lot about combining flavours), pretty venue, charming staff, not too pricey. Go there. Back to the hotel though - the staff were very friendly and on hand with advice about what to do and where to go. I wouldn't want to stay in this hotel for more than a weekend though.

However, it was a very disappointing hotel. Upon arrival the clerk tried quite hard to get us to upgrade to a bigger room. Then we found out why. The room they gave us was literally no bigger than the bed. There was no place to put anything except the bed and a tiny little narrow closet where one could only hang things, but the door had no room to open. The bathroom was not only the type you'd find on a ship (drain in floor, no shower or tub, just a corner!) but it was also dirty. Lastly, there was one tiny light making the room very dark. We couldn't believe it because we'd paid about $250 per night! When we asked to be moved to another room they didn't put up much of a fuss, but said we'd have to move back again the next night which meant that we couldn't unpack, etc. I imagine it happens a lot. We actually heard lots of other people complaining. The second room was much bigger and had an actual bathroom. And it is essential to ask for a large room when booking to avoid this mess. Also, the hotel didn't change money, sell stamps, or give helpful advice about getting around town. The location was excellent for 2 major museums, however, was a bit of a distance from the rest of town and was in a very, very expensive area. We wouldn't stay there again.

My husband and I were looking for an elegant and peaceful hotel in Amsterdam, close to key attractions (but not in the \"touristy\" centre) and found the Bilderberg met all our expectations. We could have booked online, but decided to call the hotel direct. V. good experience, I spoke to two helpful people (Danielle and Kellie), explained we were on our anniversary and wanted their nicest superior room. All sorted and I received email confirmation within a few days. We had one hiccup when we arrived - having met the friendly Kellie on reception, and getting our keys to Room 306, we found the bed in this room was essentially twins pushed together. As a married couple on our anniversary, this was not really our preference. But with one phone call to Kellie, all was sorted and we swapped keys for Room 311 right opposite with a king bed. I think we were lucky, though, as 2 nights later the hotel was full. The room was very spacious, and above all quiet. Good facilities such as tea/coffee, safe, minibar that you could open (e.g. we could have used it to keep some milk cool), all in a neat unit. Bathroom also good size, with a shower unit over bath, useful accessories like cotton wool pads, and I was glad to see a matching pair of bathrobes and slippers. The wardrobe has been described as small in other reviews; I'd say rather they are compact but there is sufficient space for everything - 5 days worth of clothes (with day and evening outfits) for 2 people fitted easily. Having been for a 2mile walk in the storm on the day we arrived, we were quite tired ... and then had the best night's sleep ever - the bed was so comfortable, and not a sound, either from outside or from within the hotel itself. In fact, during our entire stay we only ever heard one noise, but that was around 10am. Breakfast was a typical Dutch spread, with a selection of juices, cereals, cold cheese and ham, fruit, at least 6 types of bread plus pastries/croissants, and 3 hot dishes. A very generous spread indeed, and we only ever needed a small snack for lunch, as it really fuelled us up for all the walking we did. The tram stop (2 or 5) is just 1.5 minutes around the corner, and takes 10 mins into the main centre, 20 mins to Centraal Station. Just in front of the tram stop is the entrance to the Rijksmuseum, and it's only a 5-7 min walk to the Van Gogh Museum. For all those who can't resist shopping and designers...you'll be glad to know that the hotel is just around the corner from the Amsterdam equivalent (P.C. Hoofstraat) of London's Kings Road - designers galore for shoes, bags, clothing even chic little cafe-restaurants. A little rich for us, but we had fun window-shopping before collapsing over a cafe au lait at the corner. It's hard to list a downside, but if anything I'd say it would be great if they had a fuller room service option. The night we arrived it was teeming down with rain, and though the hotel kindly lent us some golf umbrellas, I'd have preferred to have eaten in, but the room service menu is quite slight and expensive for what is on it. That said, the food we did try was delicious! There is a great looking Indonesian restaurant around the corner that is worth a try, not sure about the Italian/Argentinian one. Also - give the \"spa\" a miss. We didn't try it, but it is very inconveniently positioned next to a Ladies and the open lounge, and consists of a sunbed, a chair with built-in massage facility and a whirlpool style bath. There are better salons close by. Finally, all the staff we met were lovely and couldn't do enough to help, from sorting out post to lending golf umbrellas, etc. A few tips: on arrival at Schipol, buy a Conexxion ticket (E12.50 one way, per person, E19 return) before you leave the airport, and take this shuttle bus to the hotel. Much cheaper than a taxi (E35-40) and safer/less hassle than getting the train to Centraal Station and then a tram (pickpockets). Ask the reception to book your return journey, giving a minimum of 2 hours notice from when you need to leave. Save time on queuing and buy your tickets to the Rijksmuseum / Van Gogh Museum at the hotel - they probably also sell strippenkarten for the trams as well though we didn't need them. Go to the public library on Prinsengracht where you can use the internet for free for 30 mins per person and print out boarding cards etc; you can do this at the hotel, but at an extortionate rate.

The feature I noticed first was the gorgeous tile panels just inside the front door. Further in, we could see the bar/cafe with a beautiful white fireplace, that looked very tempting. Each day, new flowers graced the bar, lobby and sitting room, too. We had a bit of a problem checking in because we missed our first night due to a missed connection in Chicago. However, the lovely young lady at the front desk (who took over from her colleague) told us that the reason our reservation wasn't showing, was because we had already been checked in, so that no one could have our room. Needless to say, I was much relieved. The elevator to the 5th floor was wide and roomy ( This is almost a novelty for European hotel elevators.!) I was a bit disappointed with the area off of which the rooms were placed, as it looked a bit institutional. Inside our room, however, I was very pleased. We had a very large bathroom, with huge black marble counter. All was spotless. The shower was great, and I enjoyed the hand held shower. Good toiletries were also supplied and replenished each day. One reason I did not give the hotel a 5 star rating was because there wasn't much room to put our clothes, etc. I had to move the extra blanket and pillow from the few shelves provided. However, the pillow and soft ,comfortable blanket were much appreciated. The room was set up for a business traveler, and even included a stapler and paper tray, which I converted to my own use for storage other than paper. The other reason I didn't give the hotel a 5 was because of the low lighting in the room, which made it difficult to read. The linens and towels were lovely, and the twin beds comfortable. The best feature of the room, for me, was the window with a view over the rooftops of Amsterdam, including a great view of the Rijksmuseum to the left. There was also a minibar in the room, which had enough space in it for the milk, etc. I bought at the local grocery store. A word of warning is that the bottles of water placed on the desk are not free. I did not see anything warning of the 5 Euro charge per bottle. However, I may have been negligent, as I am programmed to think that only items in or on top of the minibar cost money, and that water placed in other locations are free. To their credit, the front desk only charged me for 1 bottle rather than 2, when I explained that I was unaware of the charge. I also liked the electric kettle, and jar of tea, coffee, creamer and sugar. We were supplied with 2 glass mugs and teaspoons, so tea making was easy. Throughout our stay, I only heard the sound of the next door room opening twice. That's it. No noise from the other rooms. We were subjected to the sounds of revelers on the streets, which appeared very quiet during the day, but that only happened on Sunday and Monday night. For those bringing cars, it should be noted that parking in this area is quite expensive. I overheard the front desk clerk telling other guests that it costs over 3 Euros per hour to park on the street. The hotel will sell a voucher for parking, but it costs about 30 Euros per day. Parking on Sunday is free, however. We took the Connexxion Bus from the airport, which worked very well for us. The location of the hotel was brilliant. The main entrance to the Rijksmuseum was about 2 blocks away. A shopping street, which I likened to Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, is one street over. It made for great window shopping. One of the best Italian delicatessans I've ever been to-Pasta di Mamma- is on that street (who's name presently escapes me) The deli has wonderful sandwiches, which are priced just about 4.5 Euros, and can be eaten on the premises or taken away. They also have gorgeous salads, pastas, meats, etc. It was an easy walk into central Amsterdam. If you keep walking straight after crossing the street and canal in front of the Rijksmuseum, you come to a wonderful street full of lovely antiques dealers. The Vondelpark was about 7 minutes away. The residential area near the hotel and Vondelpark is very beautiful, and reminded me of buildings in London's Knightsbridge.

They also asked how much we paid for the taxi to make sure we hadn't been ripped off - offering advice on how much fares should be to certain places. We realised a certain amount of this was stalling as when we got to our room we found a freshly chilled bottle of champagne on ice waiting for us - I had mentioned the fact that we were recently married and there was a card congratulating us with the bubbly, so that was a nice surprise! Considering we had got a 'deal' on the room it was a good size with a lovely comfortable large bed, and very quiet considering the room was off the hallway near the lift. Both the room and the bathroom were impeccably clean and well maintained throughout the stay, with simple chic design, as was the rest of the hotel: it's a lovely traditional Dutch building that used to be townhouses, so there are quite a few old architectural features, but has been well designed with modern fittings that make the whole place feel very comfortable and well-heeled, but not austere as some chic hotels can. We felt very relaxed throughout our stay, and the staff were always friendly and efficient, providing us with bathrobes and an adaptor upon request (we weren't charged for the adaptor, contrary to someone else's review), and even booking us a table at a fantastic Chinese restaurant that they recommended to us (for some reason we both had a hankering for Chinese that night - go figure).

Great bed - massive! Wonderful bathroom - robes supplied! Chocs in late afternoon are placed on your pillow - we didnt do breakfast - no need since A' Dam is full of watering holes. The upmarket shopping district is one street away - and there ar great antique/book shops just across the canal from the museums. Walkable for most of the town but for the lazy days and the trainstation/airport the tram is at the end of the street. Quiet district and just a hint of luxury! Hotel has a little sauna room but its 'extra' Staff very helpful and very discreet. Hotel is in old comfy building - rooms are large.

The room was huge, the bathroom was huge and we had a balcony- it was perfect! However if we had stayed in the other room I would have been disappointed, as it was really small, there wasn't a bath and it was at the very back of the hotel. So we were lucky to have the upgrade. The staff were really friendly and informative- but they did include a sneaky charge for there services on our bill... Getting directions from the concierge should be standard and NOT charged for! Also I borrowed an adapter which cost me \u00c2\u00a39 per day (which they didn't mention when I asked for it). Other then the sneaky charges the hotel was great.

We upgraded our room to a superior upon arrival for an extra 20 euros a night. The room was lovely, with a balcony on the front of the hotel. In hindsight, I think we would have asked for one that was a little quieter at night. With the far end of the street being blocked off for construction, people driving down the street would realize this and then come backing all the way up again, so it could be pretty noisy. On Saturday night (at 2 a.m.!) there were even construction trucks going up and down the street. But the area was really nice. As others have said, a two minute walk to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh. It was a respite from the lively energy of the city center, Dam Square, etc. If you're a walker, the Central train station was about a 40 minute walk from the hotel. But there were trams you could pick up just a couple of minutes away that went there. The hotel was very nice to come back to at the end of a busy day. The bathrobes were a nice touch. There was a water heater for instant tea and coffee; not great, but enough to get you going in the morning. I thought $44 for breakfast for two was a bit steep, so we opted not to include breakfast in our reservation. There are quite a few little coffee shops where you can get great coffee and bagels or rolls, whatever you're looking for, within a five minute walk of the hotel. The staff were pleasant and courteous and unobtrusive. Except for a computer glitch on our bill where we had other guests room charges, and a 6 euro \"reservation charge\" that they tried to include on our bill \"weren't you told about the booking fee?\" (We booked through hotels.nl where it advertises no booking fee) I thought the hotel was in a wonderful location and would recommend it.", "Date": "March 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4739099", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel for nearly 4 years now, on and off. Its location and price have caused me to fogive its little quirks - like the run down elevator, the TV's that don't work very well (1980's models), inaccessible phones and boring breakfasts. However, the service I received there last time was rude and obnoxious and, quite frankly, since I am a regular there - I expected better. So now I've decided enough is enough, I'd rather stay at a hotel where the front desk staff don't treat you like a nuisance and where things in the room work.
