Positive: - good communication due to vicinity of Sants station - easy walk to Montjuic fairgrounds, which is a big asset during Mobile World Congress - nice and simple setup of public areas, especially the restaurants - helpful and friendly staff Bottom line - good for overnight sleep for a busy visit to Barcelona.

The room was small and simple, but clean, and the bed was quite firm, which I prefer. The rooms and corridors have wooden floors, and as some other reviewers have commented, are not terribly well soundproofed, and noise from the corridor could be a problem. The aircon is also quite noisy on the high setting, and I recommend setting it to low if you want to sleep well (or just bring ear plugs). I had a room at the back of the hotel, so I did not experience any problem with noise from outside. The wifi is free, and worked perfectly fine in my room on the first floor. At 65 euros per night (not including breakfast), I think this is good value for Barcelona. Despite the railway station nearby, there are not many eating options close to the hotel, so you should eat in the centre before coming back to the hotel.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bern, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cnear train station\u201d", "Author": "nubuk", "ReviewID": "UR115508214", "Content": "we stayed at this place for a long weekend with some friends and enjoyed it. we didn't have breakfast there but rather outside at one of the bistros. it is well located near the train&metro station - from where you can get anywhere in barcelona within a reasonable time (what this means is up to you). the rooms were nice, not huge but ok if you do not plan to stay in there for something other than sleeping. however, you get to hear it if someone walks the hallway or talks loud in the neighbouring rooms. rem: the bathtubs are tiny.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Argentina", "Title": "\u201cAverage, not 4 stars\u201d", "Author": "Marducita", "ReviewID": "UR102102993", "Content": "The hotel and room were fine in general, I chose it because it was near Sants station. Very good breakfast with fresh coffee, fruits, and all kinds of stuff, in a big room. Breakfast was the best part at this hotel. The room was ok and had minibar, but didn't look like 4 stars and it was small and with an ugly view although that was not a problem for me since I requested not to be placed at the front to prevent noises from the street. The staff wasn't very helpful, we had a problem with the heating (too hot, unable to switch off) and they couldn't fix it, just offered us to change rooms, which we didn't want because we had already unpacked. The safe in the room never worked, we told reception but they couldn't fix it either. I also didn't like the '90s decoration and the lack of bidet in the bathroom (in Spain most hotels have it). Also, a lady at the reception who was a local, didn't know about the existence of a mayor church of the city and told me I was wrong about it (I was right), which was misleading for us.

The hotel was great, the one and only mini complaint was that in the room we were put it originally, the air conditioning didn't work, when we told the staff of this fact, they were excellent and moved us immediately to a room with fully working air-con with no fuss. The room was small, but clean and the bathroom was newly refurbished and very nice and luxurious. The hotel was quite far out from the main sites, and after making the walk once, we never did it again, Sants station was a 5mins walk from the hotel and using that to get into the \"tourist zone\" was by far the preferred way of getting there. The hotel did provide breakfast (either a \"full buffet\" or \"simple breakfast\") at a cost, but for a reduced amount you could have a very simular simple breakfast (fruit juice, coffee and pastry) at Pans and Co next to the station which was one of the yummiest breakfasts we had ever had, totally recommend it!

However, we will return. We stayed at the Confort Barcelona, a new 4* hotel. There are some rundown buildings locally, but I think the owners are taking the long view that it will get nicer. There are good, busy restaurants around the corner. The bed was big and comfortable. The design is modern. You won't want to sit for long in the chairs in the room. Very uncomfortable! Underground parking \u20ac20, but take it as you won't find anywhere on the street! Breakfast \u20ac15 as I paid the staff in cash and didn't charge it to my room. OK, but mediocre. The nearest tube/metro station is not too far away, but the area at night did make me feel a bit uneasy. \u20ac1.35 for a single journey on the metro is good value for money. Keep some loose change in your pocket as none of the machines that we saw would give change for anything larger than \u20ac10 notes. If you plan to do a lot of sightseeing in one day, the multitrip ticket for 10 journeys works out about half price. We were approached by beggars when trying to buy tickets. There is lots to see on the Las Ramblas. Lots of street acts, dancing, juggling, music etc. Lots of restaurants and bars. On the way back to our hotel on the metro, we were the victims of a group of pickpockets. I had already read about them and being an ex-Police Officer, thought that I might be more aware. I wasn't! A group of three males blocked us getting onto the train, my wife was slightly behind and was pushed out of the way by two others. I heard her shout 'Get your hand out!' I thought that she was being assaulted, I turned around to find a male immediately behind me, My wife said 'He had his hand in your pocket' I punched him twice hard (ex-copper mode coming to the fore!) I then stepped back to confront the others. I used to teach defensive skills and unfortunately in my mind I'm still 25 not 51 (that day!). My over confidence got me a punch in the face from one of the others, but I foolishly stood my ground and squared up to them. Fortunately for me, they all retreated, without my wallet. Bruised ego and face remained on the train. Needless to say, no help from anyone else! Our children were with friends at home, but I would still have reacted the same had they been there. It was a stupid, but natural reaction for me and I would still leap in to help anyone else in the same situation. It didn't spoil our enjoyment of Barcelona. It did however, remind us what we had left behind when we relocated to France three years ago.

We booked on a stay 2 nights , 3rd night free deal which was excellent value. If you are planning on using the wi fi service then think again it costs 9 euros for 1 hour !! or 15 euros for 24 hours. A much better option is to use the internet cafe around the corner on carrer de numancia . It is very cheap at 1 euro per hour and is also very close to pans & co which is an excellent place to buy breakfast . it has a decent selection of small sandwiches and croissants , cakes etc ,excellent coffee and fresh orange juice. a typical breakfast of small ham and cheese ciabbatta , glass of freshly squeezed orange , coffee and cake would cost around 5 euros, which is a big saving on the 12 euro hotel breakfast. Barcelona is an excellent city for a short break, all the obvious sights are well worth a visit, if you intend to visit monjuic , the olympic stadium is free to enter and the olympic museum is worth a look at 3 euros i wouldnt bother with the cable car ride to the castle at the top of the hill. its a very short ride , it doesnt offer great views and is scandalously expensive . better to take your time and walk up or if thats not an option simply take a taxi from the metro station. If you visit sagrada familia (gaudi's cathedral) make sure you take the lift ride to the top of the tower it costs 2.50 euros but its a must. One last thing as in all big cities you have to watch your pockets and bags all the time , my advice would be leave the wallet in the hotel and just take whatever cash you minght need for the day. The metro is rife with petty thieves and pick- pockets that prey on tourists, I was talking to an english guy on the metro who was robbed whilst we were talking, neither of us saw a thing . !! they seem to operate in groups and when the metro is at its busiest. hope this review helps", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suffolk", "Title": "\u201cWhatever you do at this hotel, don't have the breakfast.
