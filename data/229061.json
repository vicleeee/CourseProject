First off, we arrived at the hotel around 12:00pm, and they graciously allowed us to check in 2 hours early. As stated, the rooms are very small (we had to place 1 suitcase on the desk in order to be able to walk around the bed). However, they are clean, and our room had a balcony overlooking the garden, which was quite nice. The breakfast is good, mostly pastries, breads, meats and cheeses. The convenience of being located 2 blocks from Termini Station is this hotel's best asset. The 1 problem we had with this establishment was their WiFi. Although their website states free WiFi, this is not the case. You receive 1 free hour of WiFi (you must obtain a username and password from the front desk, and the 60 minutes starts the moment your password is given). After that 1 hour, we were told that access would no longer be free, so we chose not to bother anymore. Quite inconvenient when we were expecting free access.

As others have mentioned, it's not really close to any of the major tourist sites, and IMO that's a plus. It is close to Termini station, where most every tourist jaunt begins, so there's no downside to the location. Besides, it is walking distance to the coliseum, etc (if you like walking), and there are plenty of interesting sites in their own right just walking around the Piazza Indipendenza area and towards the coliseum. For a city as busy as Rome, and a neighborhood as bustling as Termini, the hotel is quiet and the courtyard is a welcome retreat. Bar service in the courtyard was sporadic, often requiring us to hunt down a server, but it wasn't a super-big issue. Just get big beers! It's been mentioned elsewhere but worth repeating that despite what it says on the hotel website, the wifi is not free, if you have NOT booked through the hotel's site. Since most people go through brokers that means for most people it's not free. They charge 5 euros or so a day for it after the first hour, which is fine, but we didn't know about this at the time we booked. After I complained pretty loudly about it -there is no disclaimer/qualifier on the website; it just says \"free wifi\"- they finally did just give it to us, albeit in a manner that seemed like they were doing us some super huge favor. Another issue was the lack of an in-room refrigerator, and in fact of seven hotels that we stayed in in Italy, it was the only hotel to not have one. Maybe a minor issue to some, but important to us. Also, the breakfast coffee was about the worst I have ever had, anywhere. Some hotels have taken to using these automatic espresso/cappuccino makers that just cannot produce a drinkable cup of coffee. Others hotels do it too, but in Italy???

The location is nice, away from all the commotion. Our room was quiet. There is a school across the street and with the windows fully closed it drowned out the noise of the students and traffic enough for a good rest. Room had air and heat so keeping the windows closed in the heat won't be an issue. Bathrooms are clean and nice with marble and jet tub (although, ours didn't work). The location is away from all the major attractions in the city but it's close to Termini Station which is the starting point for many tours and transportation. Comes in handy too for train travel and even shopping and eating with a 5 minute walk to the station. There are several shops and restaurants within walking distance and because it's away from all the major tourist spots you don't run into as many tourist as the city center.

Adding insult to injury, the hotel Wi-Fi signal was very weak, which meant that to make phone calls via internet we had to go down to the small guest area next to the lobby. Talking there did not seem to go over well with the manager who seemed to be constantly hovering around. The buffet breakfast is good, but during our stay we did not hear any guest speak anything but German and generally every table was very subdued. It seemed as people were afraid to talk and have fun. There is a nice area with tangerine trees in the inner courtyard, although again we did not see people sitting there to enjoy themselves. We also noted tension between the German (maybe Austrian ?) management and the local Roman staff. The hotel is about a half kilometer from the main train station, Termini, so it is easily accessible. Many other hotels and restaurants are nearby, and a good supermarket (Supermercati Sir) just a couple of blocks away if you want to save on food. Check out time is noon, and my partner got delayed returning to the hotel so I rushed back and packed. I told the front desk that I would be out at noon, and the answer was \u201cYes, please\u201d. Since I could not carry all of the bags out at once, my second bag was carried for me to the sidewalk outside where I waited for my partner because I was afraid to wait inside by the lobby once the clock struck noon. Management seemed to be anxious to get rid of us and we were equally anxious to leave even though no words were ever exchanged. We do not drink, do not smoke (it is a smoke free hotel) and we made no noise during our 3 night stay.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cGlad we found this hotel on Trip Advisor\u201d", "Author": "cheshireangel", "ReviewID": "UR64929343", "Content": "It was a few years since we'd been to Rome so when we had booked budget flights we were surprised to find how much the hotel prices had gone up.

The bus stop is located on 22 Via Marsala, which is also at the Termini station. The hotel is located opposite a graffitied and dodgy looking building. Sometimes you see teenagers hanging about the building smoking. So yes, the hotel may be close to the station, but it is in a dodgy-feeling area, so I would advise walking quickly back to the hotel at night time, and definitely not by yourself either. The rooms were more modern than I expected. Yes, they were clean, but I thought that the bed linen smelled slightly funny, like vinegar. Also, our room (room 205) was EXTREMELY hot and stuffy, even when we turned the temperature down. So, we left the balcony doors open to let in some fresh air, but the outer green shutter door did not lock properly, so if you are concerned about security like me, this is not good. The cold buffet breakfast was okay but not great. Had croissants, some pastries, cakes, bread, cereal, fruit etc. However, I was disappointed that they did not have a toaster.

The main purpose of a city break is to see as much as possible of the actual city rather than spending time in the hotel. Therefore we usually try to find a reasonably priced hotel and whilst we are not too concerned with 'small' rooms, we like cleanliness! This hotel gets top marks. The rooms were fairly basic, but were immaculately clean and had comfortable beds with fresh, clean bedding. The bathroom had a great shower and again was very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the continental style breakfast was more than adequate to set you up for a day's sightseeing. The added bonus was the garden. We had rooms looking onto the garden. A small terrace provided a lovely quiet spot to enjoy a glass of wine on a balmy November evening before heading out to eat. After a long day, it was lovely to find a little cafe bar within two minutes walk of the hotel - Florians. The food (and wine!) here were lovely and not over priced. The desserts were divine! Turn right out of the hotel, then first left - it really is two minutes walk! Just one other point - it's worth investing in the Roma Pass. This provides two free admissions to the listed attractions, and reductions on any further visits. It also provides free travel on the public transport systems - metro, bus etc. See 'Roma Pass' website for further details.

We had to get a taxi from the Airport because the Leonardo Express had finished its service at that time of night. Warning!!!!! Our taxi only had two speeds, warp factor nine or Stop. Because the Hotel was only three blocks away from the Station I asked the driver just to take us to Termini, we could walk the rest of the way. I didn't trust him to take us to the hotel without ripping us off. If you are a ladies or alone I don,'t recommend this walk at night a (few undesirables about). We arrived at the hotel to chained locked doors!!!! Thankfully the Duty Manager came to the door almost immediately was brilliantly efficient at checking us in. He even asked us if we would like A DRINK FROM THE BAR! The mans a genius. After 12 hours travelling it was exactly what we needed. He offered us a seat in the Garden which on that balmy September night and a long journey was a peaceful paradise. And so to our room, Small? Yes. Comfortable? Yes. Clean? Absolutely spotless 10/10.

Once you arrive at the Roma Termini Station, you need to walk approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile to get to this hotel. We arrived at the door of the hotel at 9:00 in the morning. The staff was very welcoming and got us into our room right away. This is unheard of when arriving to a hotel in the United States. You are lucky if you can get your room before 2:00 in the afternoon. The hotel grounds and rooms are spotless. The hotel staff spoke English and were so very helpful explaining where to catch a bus to get anywhere in Rome. The place to catch the bus (No. 492) was less then a block away. If you miss it, no big deal, another comes within 15 minutes or less. The hotel is a 3 star. The only difference I noticed between the 4 star hotels we stayed at in different towns throughout italy, is that there is no mini-refrigerator in the room, and no internet point at the hotel. But there is a very nice internet point just a block or two away, so it was no big deal to go there an check my email for 1 Euro per 1/2 hour. The breakfast was absolutely wonderful. They always had fresh melon, the freshest Italian crusty rolls, the tastiest cheese slices, salami and ham slices. Three choices of cereals, including muesli, and an assortment of yogurt single serving cups. Also an assortment of sweet breads and juices. The ONLY BAD THING I can say about this place, is instead of the Breakfast Room attendant offering to make you a cappucino, they only have some sort of an automated machine, that makes the cappacino and it is awful. So, after breakfast we would walk 1/2 a block and for 1 Euro we would buy our cappacino. You will read on the internet, to stay away from hotels near the Train Station, because they are \"seedy\".

We went to get some lunch and came back two and a half hours later but unfortunately the room still wasn't ready. We sat down and read for another half an hour but was really tired by this time. When we got to the room, I was shocked and how tiny this room was. All I can say is the previous reviews must have been based on suprior rooms only. It was explained to me this was a standard double and this is what I booked. This was the only room offered on the website and yet the pictures provided were of a much larger room. I work as a travel agent and would class this room as a single. There is a double bed of the smallest kind but there is only about one and a half feet around the bed and a wardrobe pushed up against it. You cant put your suitcase flat on the floor as there is not enough room. If we had had a suitcase each we would have needed to keep one in reception. I tried the shower after this and I barely managed to fit. I am of average size. If you are on the large side, you will have a lot of trouble in the shower, there wasnt a bath at all. So again very tiny. Also After laying on the bed which was extremely hard, I wanted to see how thick the mattress was because it didnt feel any thicker than a couple of inches on wooden planks but unfortunately it was about 6 inches thick, but very uncomfortable. We both decided we couldnt stay in this room. We asked to pay for any upgrade but there werent any rooms available so we looked for another hotel. We found the Bellini Bristol for 200 euros a night. Double the price i know but quadruple the quality. We checked out that night and I was charged for one nights stay but on the return I found I had a very rude e-mail telling me that they had debited my card with another night.

What a mistake. If you have watched Fawlty Towers this will be very familiar to you! Apart from the convenience of being centrally located, the facilities were sub-standard. The room we stayed in (204) was small and the bathroom and toilet (separate) were each tiny. The view thruogh the window was of a disused University building across the street, covered in graffiti. The bath had a jacuzzi in it (which Ambra Palace did too). Unfortunately it did not work and we reported this to reception. The receptionist (who seemed terrified of the owner) commented that the jacuzzi was \"delicate\". I am still not entirely sure what he meant by this. Nevertheless, we were warned not to use shampoo etc. etc. This was not a particularly big deal for us, but he notified the management anyway. The owner called me in the room and said that I would be \"stupid\" to expect the jacuzzi to work at the rates that I was paying (about \u00a375 per night), and that anyway it would be a waste of 90 litres of water! He said he would be happy to charge me another 30 Euros if I really wanted to use it. I did not think it worthwhile arguing with him about this and did not discuss it further. The air-conditioning was just about OK (it took about 3 hours for the room to cool down to a modestly comfortable temperature but it was still not particularly comfortable). My wife was bitten by insects in the room overnight (large red spots on the skin). It is worth taking a look at some other reports here to verify that this is a common problem at this hotel. Breakfast was a hilarious affair. Immediately upon checking in, we were warned in no uncertain terms that removing unconsumed food from the breafast area was strictly forbidden. At breakfast, we were watched like a hawk by a surly matron-like attendant whose roles seemed to be to prevent guests from consuming too much food. We have relatively small appetites, but one young chap who was consuming a healthy portion was told off for eating too much! Food was swiftly removed from the serving area if 'too much' was being taken! Breakfast itself was very basic. There was no hot/cooked food - not even toast. Our advice would be to avoid this place if you can.

The bug had blood in it...I took a look at it and yes, its the bed bug. I wanted to change room desperately but my husband refuses to do so because 1) it would be a hassle to repack and unpack again...2) the other rooms might be even worse.

My husband had been stung by wasps, and bees before so he felt that bedbugs are really nothing....while I have very sensitive skin, I couldn't sleep at all the 3rd night....I requested the lights to be on so I can wake up and check to make sure....I probably have woken up every hour to check the bed...I even wrapped myself up by wearing long socks, holding onto my sleeves when sleeping...the next morning, I don't seem to find any bites on my body so I figure it is okay to stay in the same room. But I made sure that my luggage was not on the bed...however, my husband book bag was on it....I was so mad...but before I left, I flipped the bag inside out and checked my luggage, making sure that I would not be carrying these bugs back with me. Well, the 4th night at this hotel, was a little better...i slept more but still woke up to double check...no bites as well. So overall, this is a good deal but that one bed bug is really a problem. I should have told the hotel staff...but didn't remember to do so....and as per the other review, i am sure that they have heard similar complaints before. Hopefully, I haven't brought any home...but I am still very paranoid...because after staying at Rome, I went to Florence for 3 nights, then Venice for 2 nights...after returning home, the 2nd night back at home, I found bite marks 2 -3 bites across my hand and arms that just started to swell and itch...i googled these bite marks and found them very similar to bed bug bites....now I am worrying whether I brought any home....I started to disinfect the whole house, rewash everything, inspect my bed...seems okay... See the thing is, I don't know if these bites were from this hotel or from the Florence hotel, or the Venice hotel...as per google, the victim may not know about the bites until some time later....but I can't seem to believe that these bites may have taken some 8-10 days to show up...so I am hoping that I have gotten bitten in Venice and that I did not bring any bugs home =X. My suggestion to you is that if you don't care about bugs and $$ is more important, then this hotel is not bad - then go ahead and take a risk (of taking them back with you home)....other than that, I really wanted to give this hotel better than average ratings but I personally really hate bugs and my skin is too sensitive to risk it....I regret not changing hotel when I found that bug on my husband's leg.

The insect had blood in it. So we checked our bed, I turned one of the pillows and there it was, a big brown insect. I took the whole pillow with me and showed it to the guy at the reception. He killed the insect immediately and explained that this was really the first time and this insect came probably from the street or from the garden. He also promised us to have another room, which we got. We were not quite happy, but having paid in advance we accepted their offer and hoped for the best. The new room was really small and in such a bad condition, that we asked for a bigger room the following day. We got one on the first floor and moved in, only to find the same type of insect again.

These hotels were ok, but our long awaited holiday was largely spoiled. It is obvious that there are bedbugs all over the hotel. We were tempted to talk about the issue with the other guests, but decided not to, as we didn't want to spoil anyone's holiday. Why didn't the others then have the same problem? we were wondering about this, but later read that most people do not even realize that they have bugs as they hardly get any symptoms. Only the more sensitive ones (like my poor girlfriend) get more infected and the bites itch constantly. With bad luck, choosing this hotel you not only suffer from the bedbug problem during your trip, but also might carry the bugs home in your suitcase.

Centrally situated to Termini Station. The hotel is clean, maid service every day. Fresh towels left each time. Our room was out through the little garden. Small room but comfortable with adequate bathroom. Air-conditioning was a bonus as it was on average 23c every day. You are in Rome and there is so much to see & do that your not going to be sitting in your room a whole lot anyway. The Breakfast was fine, the usual continental serving croissants, breads, cheese, salami, cereals, fruit etc. Breakfast was until 10am. The Bar is small and we actually never sat it in once but did buy a beer. It was EUR5 for a can of German beer. The staff in the hotel where all very courteous. We did find that you had to leave your key at reception but most hotels normally have this policy. The one & only drawback about this hotel was the dreaded erratic showers!! The temperature was all over the place and it was annoying but you get over it. Try have the temperature increased to start with, then it doesn't go so cold!! On Rome itself. I was so looking forward to our visit and I was not disappointed. The train journey from the airport is about 45 mins and is EUR11 per person. Green line tours was the bus we choose. EUR20 each for a 48 hr ticket. We timed it that we got our ticket at 2pm on the Monday so it meant we had up until 2pm Wednesday to use the bus. The commentary on this tour was brutal however. We passed loads of interesting looking buildings & sights and nothing was said about any of it. If your using the underground it is EUR1 per ticket & this will last you for 75mins, also EUR4 for a day ticket. St Peters itself is free of charge like all churches in Rome. It is spectacular! Queue's can be very long but move quick. Best time to go is early afternoon about 2pm. You have to be covered up though. Shoulders, Knees & ankles (for men) have to be covered. Vatican Museum & Sistine chapel. We went about 11am & had to queue about an hour. Again if you go about 1pm there is little or no queue. They say it closes 4.45 but entrance actually closes about 3.15pm as they reckon it takes about 1 hour 30 mins to complete. Price in there is EUR13. Again worth it but would advise to perhaps get a tour guide if you have a few Euro to spare. Colesseum & Roman forum was the highlight for us. We got a guide for this and it was a total of EUR20 per person. We got to skip the queue and get a quick history lesson. Very interesting. Roman forum was also great & would really recommend a guide. We had a guy from the UK & he was brilliant. Really knew his history & was very interesting, we actually did the walking tour of Rome with him aswell. The walking tour is EUR20pp & lasts about 2.5hrs. Trevi Fountain is lovely spot aswell but is known for pick pocketing so keep your bags, wallets etc to the front. Eating out in Rome - we where told to judge most restaurants but the cost of the Margherita Pizza. If it costs EUR5 or less it is a reasonable priced place to eat. Anything over EUR6.50 and they are charging tourist prices. There are very few pubs! Most places are Bars but they are like cafe bars. A beer can be anything from EUR6 to EUR7.50 & that's local beer. You'll see alot of like mobile shops at all the main tourist attractions. They are expensive but convenient. A bottle of sprite is EUR4 & water EUR2. Try some nearby shops where a bottle of water can be as little as EUR0.60.", "Date": "September 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery Pleased with Astoria Garden\u201d", "Author": "Murko", "ReviewID": "UR8409084", "Content": "My girlfriend (now wife to be - since visiting Europe!) and I stayed at this hotel for several nights during July 2007. Not having travelled to Rome before, we used Tripadvisor to help select a hotel with the following important features: 1) value for money 2) clean 3) good airconditioning 4) located in a safe & central area We found the hotel to be excellent. Yes, the room was very small, and required a little bit of juggling with a couple of large suitcases, but who sits in their room for more than a quick break and to sleep? In addition, although the hotel is located only a few blocks from Roma termini, the street was very quiet and windows seem to be double glazed (quiet!). The bathroom was also small, but appeared to be recently refurbished and worked well. As identified in previous posts, the water temperature in the shower did fluctuate a bit, however i didnt find it to be too much of a problem. I must agree with all earlier comments on the breakfast. Very simple, however great for a start to the day with fruit drink, cereals, toast, fruit, some sliced meat and cheese, coffee and some very basic pastries. For the price we paid for the room, this came as a nice inclusion. Our experience with the staff was good. They booked us in for the tours we wanted to go on (Vatican etc) while we waited at reception and generally had good english to assist us. We only have a couple of small negatives on the hotel: 1) Maid service for the room seemed to occur very late in the day - well after lunch on at least one occassion. We often popped back in for a rest around this time and would have appreciated it being complete. 2) When checking into the hotel, we were required to provide ID (passports - both of us!). While I dont have a problem with showing these and letting them quickly record our passport numbers for security reasons, they insisted on keeping them to verify for an hour or two.

Before I explain what I mean, let me first say that the room which was on the first floor in the garden area, was fairly clean but had a strange odor that was a bit unsettling. Anyway, when we got there they gave us our key and there was a guy that escorted us to our room. This \"guy\" was like the do-it-all minion (nice, but a little too up in our business all the time). Upon checking in, we immediatley wanted to go sightseeing. As we were walking out of the front door, they halted us and said, \"Excuse me, we need to hold onto your key... it is safer that way\". We kind of looked at the desk guy in disbelief... and as my husband reluctantly handed over our hotel key; I became reminded of some 1940's movie... where the unsuspecting Americans didn't realize the owners of the hotel were fascist. Anyway, when we came back we had to ask them for our key and luckily, they gave it to us no problem. My husband saw a short cut through the bar area that seemed a little quicker path to our room and as we were headed to the door they yelled at us and told us we had to go around and that we were not to use that door. Strange. The next morning proved stranger. We went to breakfast and since my husband and I smoke we wanted to eat our breakfast outside in the very lovely garden. Nope! No can do; apparently, the only way you can eat outside is if you pay for your food and order it from outside. We were reprimanded once again, but for this time... trying to take our food outside. I was starting to feel like a child at this point. Needless to say, we were very anxious to go sightseeing. Yes, we had to drop off our key each time. Anyway, when we came back to the room the maid had been there and I was shocked. The room was clean, but she or he had taken some of my things and Put Them In Back in My Suitcase!!!

If your looking for a budget hotel that is a good base for your exploration of Rome this is it.

Dont bother it took the staff half an hour to take our a couple of Italian guys came in and were eating their second course before we had even got our wine. The food was below average and the staff were not interested. They managed to reduce their tip by half and I rarely leave a small tip. We decided to splash out and get a Limousine to collect us from the airport which only cost E5 more than a taxi, so we were collected by a nice guy in a black air conditioned Mercedes. We had not however reserved it for the return trip. Half way through our stay we decided to get the same limousine company to take us back, so I asked at the hotel reception if they could organise this for us. They said yes no problem but suggested they could get us a better company for the same price, I should have insisted on the company we had used before. When our \"transport\" arrived it was not a nice black airconditioned limousine it was a mini bus which we ended up sharing with two other people from the hotel next door.

The bathroom was spotlessly clean with beautiful updated tile and the in-room safe was a nice touch. A few issues that we had with the hotel. We put the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door the first few day, however every day the hotel staff came in and cleaned our room. We put the sign on the door because we had all of our travel information out and the room didn't need to be cleaned anyway (I don't change my sheets at home everyday!). The sign was removed and the room was thoroughly cleaned. I appreciate the clean room, however I think they should respect the sign. What if we were trying to sleep? The breakfast was also pretty skimpy. The lady that worked at the breakfast every morning tried her best to make the most out of what they had (she fanned the few pieces of cheese in a nice pattern, etc.) However, fresh rolls would have been much nicer. There were also tables available every time we went, which was nice. Hint: They seem to take the fresher rolls out later. Maybe they use up yesterday's leftovers first? Other then these two, relatively minor, issues, we really did enjoy the hotel and would definitely stay there again. Our room overlooked the gardens out back, and we never heard any noise at night. Every night, my husband and I enjoyed a bottle of wine in the garden while my son slept upstairs. The staff was helpful with directions and recommendations and spoke perfect English.

A day after I received an email from the original hotel stating the problem and telling me that they had re-booked me at the Astoria Garden which was another one of their properties in Rome. After a quick check with Tripadvisor I agreed to go along with the change rather than look for different accommodations. As far as location in Rome this hotel is very well situated very close (walking distance) from the main Termini Station in Rome in what seems to be a very safe area and far enough off of a main street to keep noise levels down. There is a school across the street from the entrance that could be a bit noisy in the mornings (the graffiti all over the school building's front was quit eye-opening as well). I read another review that notes to request rooms that look onto the garden/ palms rather than the street - I would agree. The room (a double) is on the small side -- but seemed clean and neat for the most part. The bathroom was clean. We did find the water temperature in the bathroom to be very annoying as it shifted constantly through three 20-second long cycles during the morning shower -- cold - scalding hot - freezing. That did make the start of each day less enjoyable during the stay. The front desk personnel were very helpful with directions and advice throughout our stay and they spoke excellent English that help compensate for our poor Italian skills. Other amenities include a garden/bar area that could be a relaxing place to sit -- but time was not a luxury for us on this trip. I will have to say that we were very very disappointed with the breakfast offered by the hotel. This was our fifth hotel during the trip and by far the worst accommodations when it came to the breakfast. The hostess was very cold and uninviting -- the offering as far as food was not much in the way of appealing -- and the biggest shock to us was that in the country of wonderful coffee options this hotel offered their coffee and espressos from a vending type machine -- which just tasted horrible.

We chose this hotel because all the Hotels closer to the Station were reviewed as being noisy from traffic and had a problem with homeless people and gypsy's. This was true. The main street is literally amassed with tourist buses, taxis, cars & motor bikes all day and night long. Rome never stops 24/7. The Garden Astoria is only a small hotel but it is very neat, clean, and being set back on a side street feels almost like a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle. There are quite a number of steps at the front entrance. Our triple room was smallish with two singles pushed together as the double and a separate single bed. We were on the ground floor next to the reception desk but noise was not a problem. There were window shutters if needed. There was a school/ TAFE across the road that was bit noisy as the students stood under our window and chatted waiting for the school to open. But we were usually up ourselves by then and it didn't bother us. The bathroom was smallish but new and functional. In the shower there is a string with like a red plastic bit on it- don't pull it. it is the alarm. We thought it operated an exhaust fan. There is no exhaust fan so It can be a bit steamy. And if there was one it didn't operate effectively. The remote TV was bit small for the room and set high on the wall. There was a desk and one chair. There was an oil heater in the room and bathroom which must have been on a timer as they were either really really hot or not working at all. We requested extra blankets which staff got straight away. There were no tea and coffee making facilities. You can buy coffee from numerous cafes nearby, approx 2 euro if you stand at the counter or a ridiculous 4.50 euro if you sit - thats EACH. And the coffee was lousy. We couldn't wait to get back to Australia for a decent Cafe Latte. The Hotel also offers a small sitting area and bar witha lovely Garden of palms & fruit trees. The breakfast room was downstairs and offered a small self serve buffet of basic pastries, cold meats, cheese, friut etc. This was best if you arrived early as later in the morning the choices became quite limited. The orange juice was actually cordial and the coffee was just okay. You could eat as much as you liked. You need to leave your key at reception on leaving the hotel at anytime. It meant we couldn't lose it I suppose. A lot of smaller hotels in Europe like you to leave the key at the reception. Our 5 night stay at this hotel was great. The location was good because after the very busy days sightseeing it was lovely to return to a quiet haven. Generally we were able to walk/hike to all the main sights except Vatican city. Otherwise the metro is literally 5mins away. Watch out for pickpockets-and especially don't travel during peak times. There are numerous restaurants nearby but the best was a pizza restaurant across the road from the termini. Roman pizza is like flat bread with hardly any topping and pretty greasy. We learnt to look for pizza places with an actual woodfire oven and ask for extra toppings. There is a supermarket within 5 mins walk to get bottled water, fruit, toiletries etc. There is no internet access at the hotel but up the street a laundromet - offers internet use at a charge per hr. The reception staff are all very helpful and speak English. The Doorman is so helpful. He is the Uncle of one of the owners and he will bend over backwards to help. I don't know whether he wanted a tip or not but we gave him one anyway. I don't know whether he speaks English either but he smiles alot. The hotel would not be the same without him.

The room itself was of a reasonable size, and the bed was comfy. The TV was very small and attached high on the wall above the bed, so was hard to watch (but you don't come to Rome to watch TV!). The room got very cold at night and the aircon seemed to only have cold, or very cold as settings. If this had been different the room was perfect. The room is double-glazed so the very light traffic noise, and children outside the school opposite is never an issue. The hotel has an elevator, although I never felt 100% sure it was going to get us up to the second floor. It also has a really nice looking rear garden, which would've been lovely had it not been January/February!!! The breakfast was buffet style and basic. The juice was only a cordial type, and indicates the amount of thought going into the 'free breakfast'. The area around Termini to the north is full or restaurants, and delis for eating and shopping. There is even a fairly inexpensive supermarket about 75 metres from the hotel if you want to stock up on souvenirs on the cheap!!!", "Date": "February 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Caerphilly Wales", "Title": "\u201cNice Enough\u201d", "Author": "julcull", "ReviewID": "UR6725536", "Content": "Just got back from Rome .

We'd rather spend less on accomodations because on ANY trip, it is more important to us to explore what a location has to offer, than to spend time in a hotel room. I did a lot of hotel searching for weeks... scouring through at least a hundred, before settling on the Astoria Garden. I checked hotels, and even private apartments that are rented weekly. With that said, we have a few basic requirements; Gotta have a private bathroom, and would like to have breakfast included with the room. I read reviews here at TripAdvisor till I was bleary-eyed; I learned that a European breakfast is what we Americans might consider to be a light snack... So my goal was to find a cheap room, near the sights, with a reasonable breakfast. The Astoria Garden met that, and much more! It was one of the few places (from the reviews I read) that actually includes meat and cheese with their breakfast. There is no limit to how much you eat, it is all self-serve, mostly cereal, coffee, juice, bread, pastry, and fruit... no eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, pancakes... I would have several cups of coffee and a couple of ham & cheese sandwhiches on Italian bread to start my day, which was just fine by me. Unlike several other reviews here: I found our room to be quite large. It was the room nearest the front desk, on the first floor. With a 10-foot ceiling, the bed (I think) was queen size... plus a chair that opened into a cot with mattress, that we used for our 4 month old daughter to sleep on. We paid $89 US/night through Expedia for a 6-night stay from Nov 11-17 2006. Bathroom was very nice, with a corner shower and plenty of clean towels replaced daily. Desk staff were excellent, and very helpful... even though I speak no Italian, and some of them did not speak much English. They even arranged a babysitter for us (to watch our daughter, in our room), while we went on the Vatican Scavi Tour, which absolutely forbids children under 15 yrs of age. Astoria Garden is about a 10-15 minute walk from the Coliseum... and is probably within walking distance of most of the major sites. We did not feel unsafe at any time, day or night, walking around the area. The Termini train station is a 5 minute walk from the hotel, and the DaVinci express train will take you to and from the airport, for about 11 euros per person, each way. Other trains can take you to within walking distance of just about any Rome location, including the Vatican. Several of the hop-on, hop-off, tour buses also begin and end their tours at the Termini station. It is THE central transportation hub in Rome, and well worth being close to... We are both very fit, but after walking around the city the first day, we were glad to be near the Termini, and just grab a day pass for the train. Maybe I just lucked-out finding this place... maybe there is much better to be had for the money... I don't know... But if I stayed in Rome again, I would not hesitate to call Astoria Garden first!", "Date": "December 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cJust back from Astoria Garden in Rome\u201d", "Author": "MandarineBlossom", "ReviewID": "UR6448383", "Content": "Good location, close to Termini station, but not too close, also another modern tube station - Castro Pretorio - available nearby, pretty good area, easy to get to the sightseeing places, walking distance from Colloseum.

Although the hotel is small, it is immaculately maintained and beautifully decorated, with gleaming marble tiled floors, polished wood and bright pastel coloured walls in the public areas. The rooms are fairly compact but very comfortable and again, attractively decorated, immaculately maintained and spotlessly clean, as are the bathrooms. The hotel serves a good, plentiful, cold buffet breakfast with a choice of meats, cheese, bread, jams, cereals, yoghurts, fruit juice and coffee and teas, in a very pretty breakfast room. There is also a pleasant bar area and an attractive tropical courtyard garden to relax in. We found all the staff to be pleasant and helpful when needed, particularly Tony, the doorman/barman. The Astoria Garden is situated in a fairly quiet (compared to most of Rome) sidestreet and the double glazed windows cut out 99% of the street noise when closed. The efficient, remote controlled, air conditioning would mean that sleeping with the windows closed should not be a problem in the hotter summer months, although in March we did not have to use it. There are a number of good, reasonably priced Trattorias, Restuarants and Bars in the immediate neighbourhood and the hotel is conveniently placed for Termini train station, the metro and the main bus station.
