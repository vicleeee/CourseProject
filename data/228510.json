This was a good stay and we were very pleased with the hotel. Madrid is beautiful, there are lots of things to do. I was concerned about the hot weather but since there is no humitity, it was very pleasant. I picked the Carlton because I wanted a modern hotel with a comfortable bed and air conditioning. The room is smaller than US standards. The price was very good so we booked two adjoining rooms for us and our Daughter. We could have had a room with three single beds but for 15 more euro per day we had two rooms. A king size bed in our room and two singles pushed together in the other room. Very comfortable firm beds. The bathrooms were all tile, glass and very modern. The bathrooms all have glass sliding doors which I liked because they are very quiet. Nice LG TV hanging on the wall but the only station in English was the BBC network. This turned out to be a plus for us as we usually end up coming home after dinner and watching the tube. Since the tube was limited we went out, stayed out late and got on the Spanish time zone which is a late dinner and sleeping in. There is a small fridge in the room and they supply free water and soda daily. The maid turns off the air conditioning when she cleans so it has to be turned on daily when you return from sight seeing. I wasn't crazy about the area, although it is close to the train station and two metro stations, it is not in the tourist area so there aren't a lot of nice restaurants around. I was concerned about crime/pickpockets that I had read about but felt very safe here. Speaking Spanish would be a big plus, but most people speak some English and our Daughter who speaks a little Spanish was able to translate for us. Some restaurants have English menus, ask for one. I'm not willing to order food unless I know what it is. We loved the Hop on/Hop off bus and would recommend doing this the first or second day, this will help you decide what You want to see. The Prada Museum was unbelievable, You really need more than one day to see it all. We did not care for the Sophia Reyna Modern Art Museum. We took the train to Toledo it's an easy day trip.

Note that the airport express bus (much cheaper than a cab) also stops at Atocha and the walk is very easy and not far to this hotel (just don't try to cut around the back side of the train station, which I did the first time ... it looks - and is - closer but you have to cut through a maze of cabs and tiny sidewalks). Anyway, the hotel's entrance - as noted by others - isn't the most user-friendly with luggage as it has both stairs and a revolving door ... but once you're checked in, it's obviously not a big deal.

But the staff does not design the interior nor plan out the hotel or room layout.\u00a0 Problem number one - a somewhat dangerous main entrance: it is a large automatic revolving door, on the corner of the building. When you arrive in blinding sun, you cannot see past the door's glass panes. I was hauling a heavy suitcase, with a duffel bag on top of it, and got stuck in the door. As I was fighting the door, and progressing towards the lobby, I almost fell off the steps - which are practically at the edge of the revolving as you enter the lobby. That was not a good start. There is no ramp to roll down a suitcase, so beware as you plan your stay.\u00a0 Problem number two - very noisy hallways: don't know if it's because a large tourist group checked in, but the stomping down the halls and loud voices outside the door and behind the walls carried well past midnight. Other Problem number three: awful hard mattresses! \u00a0Torturous sleep: felt like a plank of wood.\u00a0 Other CONS: the room lighting is too dim, and insufficient. The lighting in the bathroom is absolutely prohibitive to attempting to apply make-up: I can't help but think that no females were on the interior decor team!

The hotel is not well known and we had to direct Taxi drivers to it. The Marriott relationship is unclear and not evident in the hotel. If you book it, you need to be aware of the pros and cons, especially if you use Reward points. But the hotel is part of a very large chain in Spain with a good reputation. The location is very good. It is about three short blocks from the modern and convenient Atosha Rail Terminal. You can walk comfortably to lots of key attractions, museums and shops. Metro and bus service nearby. Plenty of restaurants close-by and, unlike so many communities near rail stations in Europe, the area around trhe hotel is apparently safe and you can walk around day and night without much concern. Madrid is extremely tourist friendly and we found many people anxious and willing to assist with directions, metro tickets, etc, so don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. Front desk was helpful and had at least one English-speaker at all times. Our room (210) overlooked a side street and on the 2nd floor which is really the 4th floor, the way the building is designed, (ground floor is \u201cHall,\u201d then O, 1, 2, etc). There was some street noise evident, even with windows closed and steel shutters rolled down, but it was tolerable. The lobby/lounge is nothing special, offers free WIFI. but again it is adequate. No smoking in the area, so that\u2019s a plus. (Spain\u2019s no smoking in public facilities policy is still unclear and apparently lightly enforced. We asked for a non-smoking room and ours was fine without any trace of smoke, but the room across the hall was sending smoke out into the hall one afternoon.) The room and bath were very good, very clean and maid service was excellent. Door had key card and secure lock. Safe in room worked well and you must obtain a key from the front desk (no charge) for your safe. Plenty of good hanging closet space and drawers. The room has a sliding glass panel which, if you desire, divides the area for comfort and privacy. Good, clean towels, sheets, linens and outstanding bath amenities were replaced daily. Soft drinks and water in fridge are free and refilled daily. This is a worthwhile feature and makes the room price an even better deal. Plenty of power outlets for recharging laptop, phone, etc. Beds were comfortable and well made every day. Flat screen TV on wall. Quality reception, but don\u2019t expect English channels. This is Spain, remember? There is 24 hour food and beverage service available from the lounge or as room service. A late snack mixed salad was fresh and well done. Prices were reasonable. Breakfast, which we only enjoyed one day, was excellent with plenty of choices and priced at 16 Euros each. Most days we went out and got bakery rolls from across the street. I booked directly through Marriott Web site and our 6 night stay came to about $830 total. Overall, this was a good hotel choice.

We walked about fifteen minutes out of the way. The hotel is easy to find and is situated on a nice busy main street. Many thanks to the other reviewers who gave detailed directions, which I downloaded to my phone! As a Platinum Marriott member, we got a small jar of candy as a welcome gift, but no free breakfast or afternoon appetizers. We ended up at some lively coffee shops in the residential area for breakfast (walk south of the hotel opposite the museum area). One place worth mentioning for dinner is Museo del Jamon \u2013 located near the Prada. The front is a lively crowded tapas bar, bakery and deli so you must walk to the back to get to the restaurant. We had a room facing the inside courtyard so we didn\u2019t have a view of all the action on the street. This was just fine -- no view, no noise! By the way, you must put your room key in a key holder near the door after you enter the room to turn the lights on. This is not only good for energy, but also convenient because you never have to hunt for the room key. The room had two ultra modern black chairs and a glass table at the end of the really nice firm bed. There was a sleek desk opposite the bed and above it was a flat screen TV. Below the desk was a fully stocked mini bar and yes, just like everyone said in other reviews, they give you free soft drinks, water and beer! We stayed three days and they stocked the mini bar each day! We liked the huge bathroom see through glass double-head rainforest shower head, large separate Jacuzzi bath tub, towel warmer and plenty of space to walk around and do yoga under the dramatic ceiling spotlights. There was also about a 10 inch round magnifying mirror, which was perfect for shaving. Give me wood floors, wood closets and wood walls in a hotel any day and yes the wood made the room seem cleaner than hotels with carpet where the maid sprays that deodorizer to give the room a fresh smell. This room just smelled clean with no artificial fragrance. The hotel had great front desk staff. There were tables and a small lounge area in the lobby across from a small bar stand \u2013 something you might have in your house \u2013 a few feet from the boutique elevator, which could fit two people and two pieces of luggage or three people and no luggage at a time.

The walk to Atocha is less than 10 mins. The hotel is also very close to Atocha metro station and a short walk from a couple of famous museums. On the metro from Atocha, you'd only be a few stops away from Gran Via and Sol. Service: service was consistently provided with a smile. We don't speak Spanish and this wasn't a massive problem at the hotel. The hotel seemed to have a very small staff contingent (so e.g. the very efficient lady serving our omelettes also chipped into cleaning rooms). Not a complaint - More a compliment to the hard working team. Rooms: We had a standard room on the 7th floor, which overlooked the back of the hotel (and unused mini-courtyard/fire escape). So not much of a view, but the rooms were generally cleaned adequately. The standard rooms are a bit small, so if you'll be spending time in your room, you might want to upgrade. Dining: this is probably the only area where I think the hotel comes up short. The room service menu is fairly limited and almost identical to the one in the small restaurant in the lobby. We ordered to our room on our first night and were disappointed by the fact that our food was cold by the time it got to us. Quality was good nonetheless, so it's more an issue around choice.

Had it not been for them, I would have given this place an excellent rating. However, the staff brings it down. As usual, in any hotel we can have obnoxious neighbors. I was in a sound afternoon sleep when I heard a neighbor check in. Right away, he aggressively started moving furniture and then started screaming into his cell phone to the point the walls were shaking. This is shocking, as the place is rather well insulated noise wise. The guest services manual was rather disorganized. I could not find an extension for reception. Therefore, I got dressed, went down and reported the incident. After I gave her the room number in questions, she said, \"He is a regular and one of our most important clients.\" I had been speaking in English. Then I switched to my fluent Mexican Spanish, telling her that I heard and understood every word of his cell phone conversation. If the hotel does not do anything to correct him, then I will. That and my Spanish really scared her and I had no further questions. However, I was left with two bad impressions. Some guests, the regulars, count more than myself. The regulars are nuts and the hotel tolerates this unless you intimidate them like I did. The place is understaffed. When I checked out and needed a taxi to Chamartin strain station, the desk clerk tossed me and my luggage out on the corner and said that taxis pass by all the time and would automatically stop if they saw my luggage. Well, I was there for several minutes while cabs passed me by that I did not hail in time. Finally, I grabbed one. Also, the desk staff is very argumentative and arrogant. When I asked about getting a taxi to Chamartin train station, she insisted I use the connecting train from Atocha, the Cercanias. I told her I had already used it and liked it, but with a suitcase and a backpack that would not work. She continued to argue, telling me that at Chamartin there were services to carry luggage. There was no such thing. She was avoiding the issue. Finally, she snapped, \"Well, if you prefer a taxi, by all means take one.\" So I was tossed out on the corner. I'm tossing this hotel out.

For the money it was a perfect hotel. We were coming in by train from malaga on day 1. Day 2 we were doing a train trip to Toledo from the same station. Day 3 we had an early flight to the airport. It is easily walkable from the Atocha train station even with luggage( 10 mins). If we had actually come out of the correct exit it would have been an easy walk to the hotel. Unfortunately we exited on the furthest side of the station. We didn't make that mistake the 2nd time. There are lots of cabs at the station and they seemed to charge an extra supplement from this location. The rooms were clean and modern however one of them did smell of smoke although we had requested all non smoking. They did quickly change it. My rate included an extensive buffet breakfast with very good Nespresso machines. They actually made a decent Cappuccino. The small lobby was always busy as it had free wifi and lots of seating. There was a large group of teens doing a Spanish course staying there at the time. I did notice a bit of noice from them filtering up into the rooms. If staying there ask to be away from the elevators and you won't notice the lobby noise. The Prado and other major Museums were about a 15 mins stroll. However to get to the centre of Madrid I would take a cab for 3 or 4 or subway if on your own. The area directly in front of the hotel has at slightly scuzzy feel as you got closer to the station. Towards the museums felt much more upmarket. We were 6 and walking in a group felt safe where ever we went. If you will be using the train a lot it's a great location. Also in the summer its nice to walk in the park and it was close by. If not I would probably stay a bit more central. For eating don't even think of dining before 9p. We found a great Italian about a 15 mins stroll and went back twice. We had to sit outside until they opened at 9pm and only the outside table were busy .

The breakfast was very expensive at 27 euros for 2. We went to one of the many local cafes where a cold breakfast was less then 7 euros. The one major issue with the hotel is its location. A big plus, but also a disadvantage. It is on one of the main roads into Madrid and the traffic is busy very late into the night. We had a street room and found the noise disturbing, especially on Friday and Saturday. The liberal use of horns and sirens is a common feature of driving in Madrid.

For a city that supposedly never sleeps the Hotel Bar, basically part of the restuarent, closed at 11.30. Having read the reviews we contacted the hotel by email after booking to ask for a room on a higher floor in a quiet location. We got exactly what we asked for, room 706. Would reccomend this room, see photos we have posted, as it was at the corner of the building on the top floor. It was large, had a huge double bed, and semed to have been relatively recently refurbished. It had everything that you could ask for including a mini bar, that was useful to empty and fill with water etc purchased from the supermarket 50 yards away. We breakfasted twice during our four night stay and the breakfast at E13.50 was very good, but I am afraid not as good as some reviewers who rated it the best they have experienced. They should try H10 Marina Barcelona for what is a magnificent buffet breakfast including Cava! Hotel staff were friendly, but we did make the effort to use our limited Spanish, always helps. No noise from adjacent rooms and fresh towels every day. Surrounding area is a bit dull with little in the way of bars and restuarents but the metro is only 75 yards away which takes you to Sol in a few stops which is a good central point to explore. The tourist bus has a stop very nearby and this is an excellent way to see the city. There are many flashier hotels in Madrid, but most of these are in the middle of the congested, noisy and frankly not too attractive central district. The parts of Madrid that we enjoyed most were to theperiphery of the centre, Retiro Park is a must to escape the noise and the hustle and bustle, relax with some stunning scenery and enjoy a quiet drink or some food. All of the food outlets are at the north west corner of the park. Plaza Oriente, Temple Of Debod and Royal Palace are also excellent places to have a seat in the sun and watch the world go by in quiet surroundings. We found Madrid expensive. With the \u00a3 and E almost at parity this is not too much of a surprise I suppose. Prices did vary dramatically though from place to place and whether you drank and ate outside or inside.

If you're not a walker, I am told that the metro is easily accessed, but I did not need to use it. The hotel is sort of on a transitional street. If you continue to walk away from the train station, past the hotel, the neighborhood seems to be less upscale, but I didn't feel unsafe and some friends and I wandered into a restaurant one evening where they took good care of us. My room was very nice (Rm. 617). It had a queen size bed and the decor was sleek and calming. It had sliding glass doors that you could close to lessen any hall noise. The room was in the interior of the hotel, so no view, but I'll happily trade that for quiet. The bath room was large, clean and well appointed. You could control the heat or AC. One reviewer stated that the maid turned off the AC, but the electricity turns off when you remove your room key from the slot by the door to conserve power. There were two computer terminals in the lobby with a printer which came in handy for printing out directions or a boarding pass. They charge a euro for 15 minutes). I also used it to book train tickets for some friends who wanted to go to Toledo. If you are thinking of a day trip to Toledo, I definitely advise booking your train tickets using the Renfe website. One of the people at the reception desk helped us. (One year my sons and I spent a long time standing in line at the station only to find that they had sold out of tickets for that day.) I never ate in the hotel restaurant. To me, 13.50 Euros is a lot for breakfast. On the other hand, if that ends up being breakfast and lunch, perhaps it's worth it. There are plenty of little places to grab a Spanish style breakfast of coffee and a toasted sandwich and/or a pastry and juice. I did have one interesting experience. The hotel had flyers in the elevator and that they distributed touting their welcome dinner. It was in English and Spanish, but the English was incorrect to the point of silliness. Dessert was described as \"ice cream with scum and chocolate\". I suggested some changes in translation to the front desk and they were quite grateful. When I returned later, the signs had been changed. I took a cab to Barajas Airport from the hotel. They called a cab on a Sunday morning for me. The ride was 30 euros. One can also go by metro, but I wasn't up to lugging my suitcase up and down stairs. I paid $130 per night for a room with no breakfast, booking through 1800hotels.

Unlike most other standard rooms this one did not have a seating area with two comfy chairs in the room (it did have a desk and chair though) but it did have a balcony with a parasol, table and chairs! The room is located at the very end of the corridor (not on the side, you walk into it) and on the back of the hotel and as such is extremely quiet. This particular room only has a (very nice) walk-in shower, not a bathtub (we didn't care) and a queen bed that was comfy enough. The air-conditioning did everything it should do and the shutters helped keeping the heat from the sun out. The choice at breakfast was huge and the quality was very good. The restaurant was clean and the service very un-Spanish (quick). Locationwise it was perfect for us. This hotel is away from the main hustle and bustle (15-20 minute walk to Plaza Mayor) which means it is more quiet than those that are in the very centre. Both Metro Line 3 and Line 1 have stations that are just a few foot steps away from the hotel. The underground system in Madrid is excellent: fast, easy and clean and although we were a bit apprehensive after reading some of the reviews here we never felt unsafe, not on the Metro nor on the streets around Plaza Mayor and between the square and the hotel in the evening. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful, a huge difference from the waiters at the several restaurants and tapas bars we tried (including some waiters at the Mercado San Miguel, which is nevertheless a must-see) and the Madrilenos in general.

This is however highly unlikely: Barcelona has more atmosphere, friendlier people, more variety in things to see and do and better, more unique (handcraft) shops and given the choice we will always go back to Barcelona.

That made the fully air conditioned hotel a terrific place to stay.

The buffet breakfast comes in at an eyewatering 13.50 Euro. For that you get an amazing choice, fried eggs, boiled eggs, spanish omelette, mushrooms, bacon, cereals, a couple of choices of juice, rolls, toast, various teas and coffees, pastries, a variety of fresh fruit, cooked meats, cheeses, some smoked fish, cheesecake and even a glass of wine was available. It was not the same two days running, they just seemed to put out what was freshly available. No restrictions on what you could have, but they justifiably only had small plates to discourage the serial 'grazers'. The good news is that the Hotel does deals that include the buffet breakfast - snap them up. The service in the hotel was good, but they have some extras that you may use that will add to the bill. You have to pay extra for internet access and the room safe for starters - so bare that in mind. The rooms were cleaned well each day with plenty of space for clothes. The rooms have CRT televisions with a couple of English speaking news channels. All rooms are equipped with air conditioning that works well. Entry to rooms is by card system which also opens the front doors if you come back after midnight, although the reception desk is manned 24/7. If you have a late flight and want to leave your luggage after vacating your room, they will look after it in reception for no charge. All in all one of the better Hotels I have stayed in. Value is all about the price you pay for what you get. So my positive review has to be balanced against the \u00a3428 I paid for seven nights for a double non-smoking room, including breakfast. That was a great deal obtained by early booking and taking advantage of all the online discounts from their web site.

However, the walls are very thin and I could hear people in the room next door. I also got woken up by people arriving late at night who slammed their doors. On my first night, there was a loud sound of machinery nearby. This went on till about midnight. It sounded like it came from the hotel, as the double glazing is so good I couldn't hear anything from outside. When I complained the next morning, the hotel staff said they had no idea what the noise could have been, but quickly moved me to a better room (a suite with a double bed). This was on the first floor and was a huge improvement. The bathroom was large and had a spa bath. There was a lot more wardrobe space. There was also a second door that insulated the room from any noise from the corridor. I wasn't charged extra for the room, but would happily have paid more as I had a very peaceful night's sleep on the second night. It was room 802 in case anyone wants to book it. The hotel apparently don't have many suites. The breakfast buffet at the hotel cost \u00a313 and was well worth the money. You can get a cooked breakfast (bacon, eggs, mushrooms), toast, croissants, cold meat, yoghurt, cereal, juice and lots more. The hotel is located about 5 minutes walk from Atocha station. It's perfectly located if you are travelling to or from Atocha.

The room came with a mini bar, safe (addlt cost option), tea and coffee making facilities, two TVs and a wide range of complimentary soaps, shampoos and such like. The breakfast buffet included hot and cold food, was of good quality with plentiful choice - a great start to the day.

Loved the hotel, only found one tiny fault: The air conditioning-because of the time of year, only the heating worked, and as the weather outside was warm, it made our room boiling. We ended up having to leave windows open (we were up on the 5th floor so not a problem) but I would like the air con to be available if you wish. Other than that we can't fault the hotel-the reception staff were all very friendly and spoke english, i was expecting them not to be friendly having read other reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. Jorge checked us in and helped with any problems, he was very efficient and friendly. The hotel provided us with helpful info-a big Madrid map in the room, and also a 'Madrid Style' book which gave lots of hints and tips, including good restaurants etc. On travelling from the airport, we got the metro (1\u20ac for a single trip but you have to pay 1\u20ac supplement charge from the airport-the machines are very easy to use, or \u20ac6.70 for a ten trip ticket-again with the supplement if you buy from the airport) I found the easiest route whilst you're getting your bearings is line 8 (pink) all the way to Nuevos Ministerios, then line 10 (dark blue) to Tribunal, then light blue (1) to Sol and then the yellow line (3) to Palos de la Frontera. The walk from here is very easy (out of the station, turn left onto Paseo de las Delicias and keep walking for about 5 minutes), however when you get your bearings, Atocha metro station is near too and you don't have to change metro as often. I recommend travelling via Palos de la Frontera whilst you've got suitcases-coming from Atocha there are a few big roads to cross. A few experiences from Madrid- Go to Toledo, the trains run quite regulary from Atocha Renfe station very close to the hotel, and it's a beautiful old city, worth travelling out of Madrid for. The tour of Estadio Santiago Bernabeu was brilliant, well worth the money, as was the tour of the bull fighting stadium (metro to Ventas) which is a beautiful building whether you're for or against the fights. The tour is conducted in spanish and english, and the tour guide was very helpful. We found Sol the place to be of a nighttime, La Tosta on Calle Victoria had lovely sangria for \u20ac10, and the very friendly barstaff gave us free tapas. Well worth a visit! All in all, i couldn't recommend the Carlton Hotel more, the location may be a little bit out of the way for some, but you can infact walk to the Gran Via in 15 mins, and it's only 5 minutes on the metro to Sol.

Firstly he gave us a twin room (we requested a double weeks before) and he told us hotel was fully booked and the rooms available are business suites for single travellers ( these are on the higher floors). Then after a few minutes he said he can give double room (so he lied before). We got to the room, door would close but wouldn't lock... luckily we checked otherwise anyone could enter our room whilst we were out. This was room 805 (it's on the 1st floor)... so if you get this room do check if they've fixed the problem!! We requested another room because it was obvious that reception staff couldn't fix the problem. They put us in the business suites on a higher floor, the bed was ridiculously small for two people ( just slightly bigger than a single) and furniture was seriously dated and old. It was obvious that the room was for single business travellers (because Jesus told us right at the start). But NOW he was trying to tell us the room is for two people ( he lied again). He said there were no more rooms. By now we were losing patience he was being extremely rude. A few minutes later he moved us again to room 806 which was fine. This room is next to room 805 (the one with the dodgy door).... so it was obvious that the hotel had rooms available but he was simply being extremely difficult... he could have moved us into room 806 straightaway without causing all this hassle. The whole process took over one hour, with 3 room changes (it was 1am before all of this got sorted) and not once was there an apology or any offer to compensate us. I expected much better service from a 4* hotel. Day staff just as unfriendly. Also beware the shower runs hot and cold. They also charge 2 euros per day for using the safe.

The hotel itself is clean, comfortable and friendly. The rooms are a bit business-like, without great character, but more spacious than in many hotels of its class, and with many amenities. Nice big bath sheets. We had a quiet room on the inside court which is more a large shaft than court. Thus, no view to speak of. The street in front is busy and noisy so we were glad to have an inside room. As noted by others, the breakfast buffet is exceptional \u2013 ham in five forms! and a great array of breakfast pastries, fresh fruits, cereals and cheeses \u2013 and was included in our room rate. All in all, very good value. There are two computer terminals in the lobby which can be activated with a credit card; 30 minutes for 2\u20ac, for example. This was our first trip to Madrid and we chose the Carlton on the recommendation of a friend associated with El Prado. There are plenty of restaurants and wine bar-and-tapas places in the area, notably the delightful and spirited Bodega Rosell, though one restaurant padded our bill and tried to overcharge us by 12\u20ac.

It is an excellent four stars hotel situated in a busy, broad one-way street. We had a room on the 5th floor at the street side. Because of the double glazed windows the noise of the traffic was not too intrusive, at least when you do not sleep with an open window. This leads to another problem: for me it was much too warm at night and the airco was centrally switched off. Reason: the fluctuating temperature outside the hotel (I always thought that inside temperature is decisive to use the airco!). Nevertheless the room was very good: spacious, very clean, good mattresses and (if you wish) two pillows per person, a bathroom with bath, and shower and a mini-bar. The breakfast is abundant and of good quality. We once took dinner in the hotel which was simple but of very good quality at a reasonable price. There is a bar with room service without extra costs. The staff is very kind and helpful. To reach the hotel from the airport take Metro nr.8 to Nuevo Ministri and than the suburban train (called CERCANIAS) to Atocha, but mind that you have to buy two different tickets. Tickets for the Metro (6,15 euro per 10) are not valid for the train (5,65 per 10). The hotel is about 400 meters from Atocha Renfe station. Tip: at the backside of the Centro de Arte Reina Sofia Museum ( a very interesting one about 400 meters from the hotel) you will find a cosy bar-restaurant El Tres. There you can have a very good menu for 8 euro including half a bottle of wine.

Staff is nice , polite and helpful. The hotel is clean and looks like having been recently renovated. The rooms, although of average size, are comfortable and well decorated. One major inconvenient is the noise caused by neighbouring rooms (especially bathroom noise). The first night, someone in the room above was taking showers from 10 to 11 PM which sounded as if we were using our bathroom. The same story started the day after at 7 AM. We asked the reception to move us to another room which they did (hoping that this noise was related to a single room).
