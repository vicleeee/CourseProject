We were a family of five--parents with three adult children and had two rooms with adequate space. The triple room had a toilet room and a bathing room which was helpful when the three were scrambling to get ready to go anywhere. The hotel is located in the Eixample area and we walked the entire city without a problem--we do like to walk. Others may prefer to take a cab or the subway to some areas. The beds are a little harder than the ones in many American hotels but I had no trouble sleeeping. We found the beds in most of the rooms in Spain to be a little harder and decided that it is preferred there.

The one problem, though, was the VERY thin walls. I could hear a loud phone conversation from the room next door and on two other nights some \"ahem\" very personal noises. There is a supermarket one minute walk as well as an all you can eat buffet called Freeway next door (I didn't eat there but had a look and they had an amazing variety of fish and other goodies some cooked to order) which is quite inexpensive (by local standards). It is also a 5 15 minute walk from 2 Micheal starred restaurants - where I had wonderful meals.

You're not swamped in the tourist trap areas, but it was an easy walk to restaurants and shops. There's also a small supermarket nearby which was great for a late night chocolate run to satisfy late night cravings! Our hotel room overlooked the main road and while not the most picturesque view, the traffic wasn't too loud. (Although perhaps because we were on the fourth floor!) The air conditioning certainly took care of any noise on the street, as it rattled and whirred its way through the night. Very effective but probably too loud if you're sensitive to noise while sleeping. The room itself was of a decent size for two people and our room was always made up every day to a very high standard. Although a double bed was requested and we found ourselves with two singles put together, the arrangement was still fine. However even for a person that likes a hard mattress, I would comment the beds were quite hard and it was considered for us the worst aspect of the room. The bathroom was spacious and had been finished to a lovely standard in accordance with the rest of the hotel. Even the room service food was of a reasonable price and tasted as good as any restaurant food! Breakfast during the week is from 7.30am - 10.30am and on the weekend it's extended to 11am. An array of mostly continental food and a few cooked items was laid out every morning as well as fresh juices, tea and coffee. It definitely helped us stoke up for the rest of the day and was well worth paying the extra money to have breakfast included. The hotel staff speak excellent English and are very friendly. They helped us with many things such as on our first night they recommended a restaurant, booked us a place there and marked it for us on a map. They also stored our luggage, ordered us a taxi and took our bags to the taxi on our final day. They also provide you with a wifi username and password when you check in as there is free wifi throughout the hotel and also a handout on the best ways to stay safe when walking around barcelona. Extremely helpful as it makes you aware of the tricks others have suffered from which could find you out of pocket afterwards! The Dante Hotel is great for that extended weekend getaway in terms of location and the hotel itself. We had no problem paying the price we did for our stay although perhaps it could be considered expensive at approximately \u00a3500 for four nights in what is considered the off peak season in the summer month of July . It was also before the summer holidays in the UK had even started which presumably meant prices would look to rise further. For a couple in their mid twenties the price may seem very reasonable, however for us having just finished our A levels it seemed a bit steep. Once we'd divided the cost by two however and had had our Barcelona getaway, it seemed like a good price to pay. Knowing we could return home every evening after having done a lot of walking and experiencing some amazing sites, to a comfortable, quiet and peaceful place was extremely inviting.

It is a little way from Las Ramblas but you can walk it in around 20-30 mins and its only a few blocks until your there.All rooms have flat screens and free WiFi and the breakfast is good with varied choices. We didn't eat any other meals in the hotel but there is a small bar which serves meals and a great restaurant just across the road called ' El Puchero de Baralantra ' which serves fantastic food at fair prices ! All in all a very comfortable stay in Barca! Great staff and a decent location , not such a busy area but right near everything there is to see in Barcelona .

Let me start with my bias. We booked two separate rooms. We get there, and they've given us one. After arguing with us over what we booked (they said that we did not book adjoining rooms), and after they were faxed a receipt, they acknowledged that their records had all along shown that we booked \"adjoining\" rooms. However, they then argued over what was meant by \"adjoining.\" The manager then had the gall to pretend that he couldn't follow us in English. However, my friend and I are both fluent in Spanish. The manager acknowledged that the \"adjoining rooms\" option cost more than the single room option, but actually claim that the posted description meant that we were seeking to book a single room with an adjoining door! \"Why would anyone pay extra just to have an extra locked door?\" We soon got to the bottom of this scam when a sympathetic employee explained to us out of the manager and front desk guy's earshot that Hotel Dante manager does this intentionally. They collect the higher rate for adjoining rooms from unsuspecting American guests, put them in one room, and wait for the complaint. They then pretend such confusion has never before happened, and explain to the gringo that only adjoining room was booked. If there's too much fuss, they pretend they can't follow in English, and count on the traveler to give up the fight after a long international flight (according to the staffer, the no English thing has failed them before, but they keep trying it anyways). They then turn around and rent the actual adjoining rooms to Spainards, getting double premiums for the rooms. The disenchanted staffer pointed out that everyone seems to miss that they don't even get the room they supposedly paid for, as the gringos are never put in one the rooms that could adjoin (as there would be no way to then collect a premium for actually renting those rooms as adjoining rooms to Spaniards). He told us that someone had rattled them before by insisting on a room with the extra door, and that we should do the same. Following his advice, we keyed in on the fact that the room they gave us didn't actually have an extra door, and we forced them to move us to a adjoining room with a locked extra door. By doing this, we cost them the extra premium, but the manager and front desk manager were extremely nasty to us after that. The front desk guy even gave us directions after that, that if followed, would have made us miss the very event for which we came to Barcelona. Good thing we no longer trusted him. But as for the hotel itself, the location is pretty bad. It's far better to stay closer to downtown. The staff is bumbling in either English or Spanish. The rooms are tiniest I have experienced anywhere, and I've been to 40+ countries. The air conditioner didn't work half the time, and the room was burning hot. The wifi never gave us a usable signal, and we had to resort to internet cafes. The maids though, were very friendly, and tanks to being near nowhere, it was quiet. However, I've stayed at other hotels in Barcelona, and is the by far the worst. There are much better options closer to downtown for the same price. After this and another experience in the U.S., I've learned to not trust the Best Western name.

They could not answer basic questions about where to find travel necessities. Also pickpockets are notorious in the area and after my husband was hit by one (they didn't get anything but they spill some crap on you that looks like vomit or bird doo and then offer to help you clean it off as they pick your pockets) the hotel staff gave us a safety sheet that warned of this.

The lobby cafe was really bad, but the breakfast was good for what it was - not gourmet, but good selection and very reasonable quality for an included hotel breakfast.

Location....If you are planning on walking a lot around Barcelona's architectural gems and shopping areas, it is a pretty good walk. For the airport transfers is quite convenient. As somebody already pointed out here, the Aerobus is a short walking distance away. But again, like in a case with me, if you have a lot of luggage, it won't work. The best part of this hotel location is Cerveseria Catalana (hope I spelled it right) is situated on the same Mallorca 3-4 blocks away towards the city center. Cheap great food and beer. Always packed with locals. Don't take a table, get situated by the bar and talk to the bartender directly, they all speak good English. It is also fun to watch them work. As a general rule, do not get breakfasts at any hotel (unless it is included in your stay). Get outside and buy better food for 3-5 Euros per person instead of 13-15 at the hotel.
