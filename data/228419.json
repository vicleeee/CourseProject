On our arrival at the hotel, much to our delight, we were informed that we had been given a free upgrade to a suite. The suite was on the 9th floor which gave us fantastic views over the city. The suite was large, well appointed and very comfortable, with a large bathroom, sitting/tv room, and a bed the size of a small country! The d\u00e9cor in the suite was perhaps a little old fashioned, but in good shape, and the colours used, created a very calm and relaxing environment. The public areas had been thoughtfully designed. The lobby for example was huge with very high ceilings and marble floors, however, it felt cosy, and welcoming, rather than feeling as impersonal as a railway station platform! The staff were fantastic, all very friendly, efficient and highly professional, with excellent linguistic skills. The hotel seemed to be extremely busy, with several large groups of oriental and American tourists, plus countless European tourists, but the staff handled everything in a calm and unflustered manner. Breakfast was included in the in the price, and was a self service, buffet style arrangement. There was an enormous variety of food and beverages, cereals, bread and rolls of all types, as well as a bain marie full of cooked items, plus a chiller with fresh fruit, fruit salads, yoghurt's, fruit juices etc etc etc. In the area surrounding the hotel, we found a variety of shops, restaurants and cafes. There was some building development on the go nearby, and gave the area, a rather dusty, unkempt feel, however, the further we ventured the more charming little squares and and walkways we discovered. In my view Barcelona is best visited without a vehicle, as it is one of the most frustrating places in which I have ever driven. The public transport system is fantastic, with an underground train system, buses and trams, all very reasonably priced, plus taxis by the score. Barcelona also seems to be a a good place for walking, with many quiet back streets, wide boulevards, parks and pedestrianised areas near the port. I have had a small taste of Barcelona during our three day visit, and am keen to go back and see more, and I would have no hesitation at all in going back to the Hilton Hotel!!", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNOT a 5 star hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Selltell", "ReviewID": "UR126891615", "Content": "Altough i booked trough priceline.com, i expected a nice hotel.

The hotel is walking distance to the Metro stop Maria Christina and very close to Espana (the dancing fountains). It's also walking distance from a great department store El Corte Ingles. The Metro (subway) system in Barcelona is excellent, it's safe, clean and will get you anywhere you need to go. It has very clear map indications of stops, connecting lines and other connecting forms of transport. You can buy a ticket and take unlimited rides all day or for several days. The hotel is located on a Diagonal, a major thoroughfare. It's easy to walk down a few blocks and catch one of the \"Hop on Hop off \"double decker buses going all around major points of interest in Barcelona.

As a base for the weekend it was entirely adequate and the breakfast was a definite highlight. Taxis into town tended to cost around 10-15 euro and about 30 euro to the airport so after being initially concerned that we might be too far out, the location didn't prove a problem. The issue with this hotel is the service from the majority of the staff, especially those on the front desk and those in the restaurant. It was probably some of the worst service any of us had experienced in any star hotel, let alone one proporting to be 5 star. We were in no way a roudy group and were always polite with the staff and fortunately had a few Spanish speakers for those times speaking English with the reception staff got absolutely nowhere. Some highlights included: Some bedrooms not being cleaned by the time we came back early evening from a day out. In fairness to housekeeping they came straight away when rung, but you can't help thinking that this a 5 star hotel... My friend ordered a bottle of water from downstairs to be delivered to the room. After a series of cock-ups, including a rude phone call from reception telling her she was in the wrong room (she wasn't-they'd provided her with that key when checking in) about 45 minutes after ordering the water, someone just walked into the room without knocking whilst she was in the shower. On their website and in-room literature they advertise that they have the use of a nearby pool. When we asked we were told \"no\" there was no pool nearby. Only when one of our group who speaks fluent Spanish asked did they finally tell us where it was. Both mornings at breakfast it was lucky dip whether they asked if you wanted tea or coffee, or whether you just searched for it yourself and although most items were restocked, there was often a wait. They let us store our luggage in a room altogether on the last day, only to return to the hotel to find there had been a staff change and the new member of staff knew nothing about it. Que yet another protracted conversation with reception. To top it off my friend who booked all the rooms is embroiled in an ongoing saga of being refunded for a room she never booked, but that's for another day!

We stayed on the executive floor, which provided us with a very nice breakfast, decent appetizers at night, and snacks/drinks for our kids all day. The room, a bit larger than the standard, was small but adequate. Unlike other reviewers, we heard little noise from other rooms, and we stayed here both pre- and post-cruise. The hotel is well-located, walk to two malls, the metro, and hop on, hop off bus. Tip: the Illa mall has a place that will do you laundry same day for MUCH less than the hotel charges (8 Euro for a shirt? geez!) What really made the hotel for us was the staff, especially a woman named Marycal in the lounge, who really went above and beyond. The only disappointment was that we called the night before departure to make sure there would be an SUV/minivan style cab available for our large party and luggage. We were told it was reserved. The next morning, no one knew anything about it. Fortunately, there happened to be such a cab in the line, otherwise we would have had to pay for 2, an extra $35 or so. Don't rely on Guest Services, especially if you are on the executive floor, use the concierge well in advance. Three more tips: (1) be very careful with your cabs. even though I showed the driver at the airport the address, he heard \"Hilton\" and took us to the OTHER Hilton. Another cab managed to squeeze an extra 5 Euro or so from us by taking us on a roundabout route. The trains are great and come very frequently, so it's easy to avoid taxis. (2) The hotel has a Hilton Honors checkin, but the line there was almost always longer than the regular line, just go there. If you are on the exec club floor, I think you can go right there to check in; (3) If you're a Gold member, don't forget to ask for access codes to the Internet.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "charlotte, nc", "Title": "\u201cNot great, but not bad either.\u201d", "Author": "inhiding", "ReviewID": "UR114613854", "Content": "We spent four nights in a room on one of the HH executive floors.

This hotel should not be rated 5 star, 4 would be about right but it is quite cheap and it is good value. It has one exceptional feature which is - its within walking distance to the Nou Camp!! This is only going to be useful to you if you're in town to watch FC Barcelona play - but they have the best football team in the world so that is precisely what a lot of people are in town for! If you've ever tried getting back to the centre of Barcelona after a match (the stadium capacity is 98 000) you won't get a taxi and you will wait at a subway station for hours so a hotel that you can walk back to is a great advantage - its about a 15 minute walk. If you're in town for anything other than the football you will get a lot better location and service in the city centre ( this hotel is on the main Diagonal and a good way from the centre although there is a subway nearby). So I really only recommend it for its proximity to Camp Nou. Bedrooms are quite small and a bit tired looking and the view out of the window is nothing to write home about, but the rooms are clean and you get decent maid service.

And my usual constant gripe in nearly all my hotel reviews: paying for internet access; how come hotels charge us for this essentially fixed-cost item? Answer: because they can. Why don't they charge extra for running water and lighting?

We booked through the Hilton website and paid 95 Euro for a standard room. As we are Hilton Honors Diamond members, we were upgraded to the executive floor. When we arrived at the hotel, a porter greeted our taxi and took our luggage in. Check in was smooth and we were on our way to our room in moments. The lift doors opened on the 4th floor and bam - we were in the executive lounge which had been designed to fill the space that would have been outside the lifts, several corridors ran off the lounge and some rooms opened directly onto the lounge. The design was to say the least, a little strange, but more of the lounge later. Our room was a couple of doors up one of the corridors. What can I say about this room? Was it a Hilton room? I'm not sure. It was very 'boutique' with white opaque glass wardrobe doors, lit from behind, a very low bed on wheels, beech wood low level shelves and the TV was on a shelf around 4ft off the floor. I'm sure it works for some people but we really did not appreciate the design. We then went into the lounge, which in the afternoon served snacks, nuts etc as well as tea, coffee, soft drinks, beer and wine. Hard liquor came out after 5pm. Again, as with the bedroom, I did not get the design of the executive lounge, it was rather impersonal and did not really seem to fit in where it was. That said, it had among the best spreads of drinks and snacks of any lounge we had been in, just a shame it wasn't very comfortable. At 3pm, afternoon tea was brought in, which comrised of sandwiches and cakes, very nice. We decided to take a nap, we did not sleep very well as the bed was not that comfortable. That evening we had a quick drink in the lounge before heading out to explore. To be honest, there's not that much to see close to the hotel and after walking around for about an hour, we went back to the lounge. When we had checked in, earlier that day, we were given a letter with the 'Rules' for the executive lounge, something we'd never had before, however, the rules stated that we could order room service and eat it at a table in the lounge. So I ordered a Pizza and my wife ordered a soup. WIth the tray charge, this came to 33 Euro. The order was placed for us by the exec lounge host. To be honest, the food was not that good, but we were hungry and there were not many choices available outside and in any event, we would be going on a cruise for 2 weeks, so I didn't expect to be hungry for long. After a couple more drinks, we retired for the evening. The a/c in the room would not blow cold, just luke warm, but that was ok as we found the room quite stuffy, we could not open a window and there was no extraction fan in the bathroom. Then at sometime after midnight, the electricity in the hotel went off, so did the a/c. over the next 3 hours or so, we tossed and turned, trying to sleep as the temperature in the room started to build. It was quite unbareable and we had no sleep whatsoever. A little after 4am the electricity came back on and only then we managed to drop off to sleep. In the morning, we went down for breakast, we did have the choice of either eating in the exceutive lounge or the main restaurant at no extra charge, so we chose the main restaurant. The breakfast was excelent with many choices and even sparkling wine to mix with your freshly squeezed orange juice. Once we were ready to check out, I spoke with the exec lounge host about the problems with the a/c and the overnight powercut. She said she did not have authority to deal with the situation and that I should speak with reception. I went down to reception . I explained our overnight isses and the receptionist explained that there had been work carried out at the hotel overnight and that the wrong section of the hotel had been turned off. She seemed to think that the explanation was enough in itself. I suggested that I had paid for a good nights sleep and had not gotten what I paid for. She said she would make a note and that someone from guest services would contact me at some time in the future. I explained that I was not happy with that and I asked to see someone from guest services now. She said I may have to wait. I said I was not in a hurry and that I would wait. After about 15 minutes a lady from guest services appeared and she again appologised and sorted things out for us I liked the Hotel the staff were really friendly", "Date": "January 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in a good location\u201d", "Author": "Sidhuri", "ReviewID": "UR48439304", "Content": "We spent two nights at the Hilton Barcelona following a seven day cruise.

Unfortunately, my wife had to have emergency surgery right before our trip, so we were not able to make our Barcelona trip. Even as a Diamond Hilton HHonors member with Doctor's notes galore, getting a refund on the prepaid room amount turned out to be very challenging, and the Hilton Barcelona's excellent customer service were the heroes in this situation. To get the refund, I first called the US Hilton HHonors desk, who forwarded me to the US Diamond desk, who forwarded me to the US Prepaid help desk, they mentioned I'd have to call the hotel directly. I called the Barcelona hotel reservations, but it was after hours, so the call was routed to a European call center, who told me to call the hotel when the front desk was open. A day later and over an hour already wasted on the phone, I called the Hilton Barcelona hotel directly during their reservation desk's business hours and the attendant was very curtious and understanding of our situation and inability to travel, and they refunded the prepaid amount back onto my credit card. Some advice: buy the prepaid rates with caution as non-prepaid-reservations are very easy to cancel, and if you must cancel the prepaid hotel stay for a legitimate reason, call the hotel directly to request a refund and don't waste your time talking to someone in the Hilton call centers, it is up to the individual Hilton hotel to evaluate your situation and grant refunds.", "Date": "April 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cEverything a Hilton should be\u201d", "Author": "TravellerforBusiness", "ReviewID": "UR23064290", "Content": "Spent 3 nights in Hilton Barco in Nov 08.

The bath had a curtain that didn't quite fit, so the carpet into the bedroom and the door frame were starting to rot away. Nothing serious but why has nobody from maintenance noticed? Stayed for 4 nights and one day the room wasn't cleaned. Not a big deal, but had to wait a further hour before someone from housekeeping came. Breakfasts were very good. Hot and cold to suit most tastes. Staff throughout the hotel were very good, polite, attentive, although I did come across a couple of waiters in the bar area that spoke NO English. Very unusual in a European business hotel, but it was fun to point and smile to ask for what you wanted. Location is good from airport. 20 mins and 20 Euros by taxi. Metro is right down the road and is very cheap. 5.50 Euro for a one day \"all you can eat\" ticket. You can walk to the Ramblas tourist area in about 30 mins, but it is worth getting the metro back.

Here\u2019s a recap of what was great and some things that could have been a bit better. Staff: All the staff members we interacted with were pleasant, professional and helpful. We arrived early in the morning but as luck would have it, the staff juggled some things around and was able to provide us with a room. Facilities: The outside of the hotel has clean lines, with lots of steel and glass, but it is not particularly distinctive. The lobby d\u00e9cor is very modern and tasteful. All of the common areas looked recently updated, with nothing that was worn, dirty or tattered. The room was small, like many European hotel rooms, but nicely decorated and in good condition. Everything was clean and comfortable. We stayed on the concierge floor so we had the added benefit of a daily breakfast as well as an evening cocktail/hors d\u2019oeuvres buffet. Highlights: I was able to use my Hilton Honors points to get the room for free, so that was very nice. The concierge was helpful and courteous. The hotel itself is lovely and the neighborhood is nice too, very clean with lots of beautiful trees and flowers. Areas for improvement: \uf0a7 Identify the hotel a little bit better on street level; the trees can block the name if you\u2019re in a cab. \uf0a7 Extra-padding for the beds: they were a little bit hard and somewhat low to the ground. \uf0a7 Re-think internet access prices- 22 euros per day is a ridiculous amount of money to have to pay at a nice hotel when cheaper hotels offer it at low-cost or for free. Also, the location is a bit removed from most of the popular tourist areas and there were not a lot of restaurants to choose from nearby, but the hotel is very close to the subway, so it was easy enough to use that to get around and the heart of Barcelona is no more than 10 minutes away by cab. Overall impression: A very nice hotel, well-managed, friendly and professional. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to a friend.

From the airport take R1 train to Sants Estacio (2.60 Euros) and change to L3 to Maria Christina (1.20 Euros). Total 3.80 Euros. Much cheaper than a taxi and dead easy. Get a ten trip Metro ticket for 6.85 Euros - excellent value. We didn't use them but there are loads of buses right outside the hotel as is the tram. Taxis are everywhere. Coming out of the Metro station turn right towards the Hilton. You cross over a very busy underpass and a busy junction. There on the corner is El Corte Ingles - a fantastic department store. Everything you will ever need is there. In the basement is a large supermarket - again with everything. Excellent prices too. On a par with the larger Carrefour supermarkets elsewhere in Spain. Buy drinks here and put them in your mini-bar to keep cold. Save yourself a fortune. Next to El Corte Ingles is another shopping centre with lots of VERY nice shops. Also quite a few VERY nice food places downstairs - good for lunch and quick snacks. For a reasonable price meal turn right out of Hilton and walk about 1Km to GINOS. Very friendly, good food, good prices. Around the corner to the right from GINOS is La Bo Tiga - a new contemporary eatery. Great staff, great ambiance, great food and stunning prices. It is bright and new. It is also a great place to eat. The city is well documented elsewhere but in just 3 days we had an excellent time. Lots and lots of walking - the best way to see a city. We never got to La Rambla though. Go there .... and don't forget the cable car over the harbour - take your camera!!

I was on the executive floor and so rooms were supposedly a bit better than the rest, however the bathroom was old and, most important, THEY DID NOT HAVE NON SMOKING ROOMS ON THE EXECUTIVE FLOOR!! So the floor and the rooms smelled of cigar.... Apart from this the location is not so central but not in the outskirts either, it's a residential area, so for businesspeople it's ok, for tourists maybe less.
