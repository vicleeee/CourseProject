Check-in is quick and easy. Very friendly staff. Breakfast is overpriced at \u20ac13 per person. Rooms are larger than I expected. Small bathrooms and TV. Only 2 English channels, and one of them is CNN. Location is about a 1.5 minute walk from the Landsberger Allee S bahn stop with several trains and trams to connect you to the city. If you want to stay near the action, this is not the hotel for you. However, it's about 16 minutes tram ride to Alexanderplatz where you will find a myriad of things to do. There is a Mexican restaurant a few doors down and a few corner stores to buy beer and supplies next door. There is also a small shopping center with groceries, a pharmacy and an ice cream store around the corner. There is an EXCELLENT Italian place about a 5 minute walk away with a great value for portions. (The name escapes me, but ask the front desk) Burger King across the street for a late night snack. Free wifi, but you have to get a card every day as they change the username and password. This allows you 24 hours of Internet. Hotel is next to the Generator youth hostel, but I didn't notice an influx of teens. Safe neighborhood. If I had an unlimited budget, Park Plaza Alexanderplatz or the Radisson Blu would be my first Club Carlson choices. But since I needed 4 nights, and wanted to use points, this hotel made more sense.

Best take control of the remote Tram stop and S-Bahn station (on Berlin ring) just around the corner in Landsberger Allee both with frequent services.

The hotel is what it is - a suburban modern-ish square box with sub-Premier Inn fixtures and fittings. A quick look at tripadvisor and the area would tell you that. It's not four star - probably does well with coach parties and people playing at the sports complex next door - but it was never going to be more than a cheap and cheerful place to sleep. On the positive side - it's clean, good breakfast, friendly staff and actually pretty well-located - albeit in an area that looks like a main road into Liverpool. But then this was East Germany - and anyone reading a little bit of history of the city would marvel at the fact that people seem cheerful, resourceful and helpful after all the misery they've been through. Buy an ABC ticket at the airport and you have the run of every train/tram/underground for miles around for about \u00a37 a day. The very regular tram round the corner drops you in the city in about 10 mins and two stops north on the S-Bahn - also two minutes walk - you're in Prenzlauer Berg. We passed on the Groupon grub - and headed to Prenzlauer Berg - lots of restaurants (would recommend Zum Dritten Mann on Kollwitzstrasse) open in the evening in a lovely area of cobbled streets and grand albeit yuppified houses. Very pleasant to wander around during the day as well with lots of coffee and cake shops. Overall - you get what you pay for - we were reasonably happy with the hotel.

From previous reviews, I was worried about how far away the hotel was, but, found the tram ride home from Alexanderplatz each night very easy (about 10 minutes). We bought a three day welcome card including the museum island, plus a group transportation ticket for our arrival day so that we could extend our transportation. The big sign for the Generator hostel next door made it easy to find out way from the train station when we arrived from southern Germany, as well as find our way home each night. It seems that any place you stay in Berlin, getting a public transportation pass makes a lot of sense since the sights are not that close together. We used Priceline name your own price--about $600 for two rooms for five nights (about 18 percent discount over the pre purchase price through the hotel website). The Priceline price, though, did not include breakfast which is 12 euros per person. it seems like most people who reserve here have breakfast included. We noted that restaurant prices are more in the East than the West, especially the touristy areas. At alexanderplatz before our bike tour, we spent much more for breakfast. Our friends had breakfast at the hotel yesterday and thought it was good, and the husband laughed and said he didn't recognize he had stayed at the hotel for business until he saw the breakfast room. There are two small cafe/bakeries on the same block, along with a supermarket (open at 8 am) so easy to pick up fruit, yoghurt, bread, coffee etc. as a less expensive breakfast (didn't see eggs though). I walked in the hostel and could see how a previous poster just helped themselves to the included breakfast there (was checking whether we could pay for breakfast but other than 1 euro for taking it out, didn't see such an option). But, ethically, wouldn't recommend having breakfast at the hostel. We asked for a quiet, nonsmoking room and were given one facing the \"courtyard\" on the eight floor. Our friends room faced the youth hostel and the kids would wave at them from their windows. Although a previous poster said there is no air conditioning--the front desk confirmed there was and there is an individual temperature control in the rooms. The windows do open, but, the temperature is fine in the rooms. We found the rooms to be clean, and got fresh towels each day along with free water. The wireless Internet works just fine--based on previous suggestions, we requested the numbers each evening (one per wireless device). The codes change and are only good for 24 hours. Another poster had noted the bar at the top of the nearby Land'l hotel (across from the tram stop). Our friends checked it out the first night said it was very nice but stuffy.

BUT, given it takes 20+ min to get anywhere central, the location is not a practical one for a tourism visit since you can't get back to the hotel easily in the middle of the day (a *must* in a Berlin summer).

But I think this is not enough to discard it, because you receive a lot for your money. It says that is a 4-star hotel, but I think is more a 3-star property. But the key factor is that you could have a clean, big (in European terms) room for a low price. What do you sacrifice? Proximity to the city centre. But Alexanderplatz it's just 15 minutes away by tram, so not very far. Room it's clean, although not superclean. As for the maintenance service, I think they could do more. But it's enough. I found the mattress very comfortable and had a good sleep. Room faced a patio, not the street, so I didn't heard noise. Air conditioning worked well, although I didn't really need to use it very much. Windows open, so I could ventilate the room. Bath, in my opinion, need a reform. Shower doors testify a long use. But everything worked fine. Hotel has two levels of wi-fi. A paying one, that is faster and without limits, and a free one (the one I used), with some speed and download limitations. But I managed to make calls with Skype and check emails, so was enough for me. You need to ask for a password every day. A weak element is TV. Maybe you won't spend a lot of time in your room watching TV, but if yes, channel selection is limited and rare. Some channels were not working, and some choices were unexpected (i.e. there is one Spanish channel, but it's a regional one). I didn't have breakfast there neither used the bar. In the morning, I went to the small shopping centre in which the hotel is. It has a bakery, a coffee shop, a kebab restaurant and a supermarket. Opposite the hotel, there is a Burger King. Hotel area is not the best in Berlin, but I didn't feel unsafe. Just went from tram and local rail stop to the hotel and back (1-2 minutes walk). The staff I found at night was very kind. The rate I found makes this hotel an excellent choice for Berlin. Through Park Plaza website you find very good rates. Maybe with a 'name your price' option, you could find a slightly lower rate.

Room and bathroom were small but clean, the bed was a bit too soft for my taste. Altogether I think that this hotel does not deserve four stars. It feels more like an average 3 star hotel. Also nice was the free (at least for us) directly behind the hotel. Even though the hotel is a bit off, both a tram and a subway station are very close by. Alexanderplatz for example is a ten minute tram ride away from the hotel. Wi-fi was free but very slow on the 5th floor, a guy from 6th floor told us that wi-fi was not working at all there.

I had chosen its location for its easy access to the S-Bahn and tram system. S-Bahn Station is just around the corner, no more than 100m, and the tram stop is at the corner with Landsberger Allee no more than 50m away. It was spot on for location, and all of Berlin`s excellent transport system at our fingertips. So I must give it 10 out of 10 for location. Our rooms - our rooms were not what I had asked for, I had emailed the hotel and requested an upgrade to our rooms (which we had to pay for, of course), but when we arrived this had not been done - even though i had a hard-copy of their email which informed me that they had the suite rooms available and reserved for us, a glitch which i was not happy about. We were given rooms on the second floor, which were clean and tidy - but rank of cigarette smoke, and thank goodness we did not spend much time in the rooms. However the beds were comfortable, but the street is very noisey from around 6am onwards, we are early risers - which was just as well. We did not use any of the hotel facilities, the 12 Euro breakfast we felt was much to expensive - we got a very nice 4 Euro one in a cafe around the corner near the train station. We did not use the bar very much - I think only one night for 2 drinks, but it was not that expensive - and pleasant. There is a hotel across the Landsberger Allee on the other corner, we used their bar on the 14th floor - a super location, fine views over Berlin and really plush surroundings, good beer and free nuts with every round - but if you give the waitress a tip, every body gets loads of nuts! In all things you get exactly what you pay for - we got a 2 star hotel, for a 2 star price. If they wish to call themselves a 4 Star Hotel then that`s fine (but wishfull thinking on their part) We did not see anything remotely like a 4 Star Hotel - but what we did see was OK, and if you are on a budget with a few mates and would rather spend your euros on beer and food - than accomodation - then this hotel is for you. Upon returning home, I noticed that my credit card had been charged an additional 400 Euros, when i contacted my card company they informed me that this was normal for this chain and that it would drop off my account in a few days - which it did, but I was nonetheless less than chuffed with this ability to charge my account with whatever they liked without my consent.

However, the area is not very interesting (a rather bizzare Mexican Restaurant nextdoor) and you really do need to travel to find cafes, museums, bars and shops. It is not the standard I am used to from a Park Plaza to be honest. I could be wrong but it looks as if it has been converted from another hotel chain. The biggest problem with the hotel was the temperature. I cannot find the words to explain how hot it was. My friend and I were 'upgraded' to exective rooms on the top floor of the hotel(this means free bottles of mineral water and mouthwash - apart from that there is no difference to rooms on lower floors). How do I know this? Well heat rises and I have never been in a hotel room that is so hot. There was a fan but it did nothing. The room was unbearable.

Very impressed by how close it was to a U-Bahn/S-Bahn station; literally 30 seconds away is Landsberger Allee station which serves the lines which take you into town. It is quite far away from the main hustle and bustle of Berlin - I'd say about a 20/25 minute tube ride - but it's all very straightforward to find which lines you need and where to change. DON'T get the tube to Storkower Strasse; go to Landsberger Allee instead. Storkower Strasse station is a huge trek from the hotel! The hotel itself was fairly basic, but very clean, well maintained and demonstrative of great service. Our beds were turned down daily and rooms tidied, and we weren't bothered by housekeeping at all...the maids were invisible, yet our room was kept immaculate. Towels were changed on request, and I THINK we got new sheets at least once. The bed was GREAT; a HUGE double that was really comfortable. We didn't do the breakfast buffet at all, though I sort of wished we did. They issued tokens, apparently due to our booking with a particular travel website, that allowed us to have the buffet for 8 euros rather than the standard 12, but we didn't use it as we'd often snack on Wurst at about 11am instead! Didn't use the hotel bar either. Our room really was just a base! The reception staff were excellent and helpful. I tried out my terrible, hotch-potch German and they humoured me...and then when the inevitable happened and they asked something I didn't understand, they repeated the request in perfect English. They also seemed to remember us throughout our stay, automatically speaking English whenever they saw us. The only negative thing was that I think our TV didn't work properly. It promised BBC on one of the channels, but we got only static. Also, teletext didn't work and neither did the messaging system, or the TV info. Whilst flicking through the channels we got the shock of our life when confronted with, well...a rather sizeable piece of man-equipment thrusting across the screen, to find that the Pay Per View porn was activated of its own accord!! We hastily switched over and consulted the guide in the room, which told us that if we wanted Pay Per View we had to go through a series of pressing buttons, confirming payment etc, which we certainly hadn't done. We tried pressing all the colour buttons to see what they'd do, and just got an error message...confirming, at least to our minds, that the TV was indeed not working properly. We were all ready to defend ourselves in reception if they tried to charge us for three days' worth of televisiual romping, but they didn't mention it.

The room was cheerful and hip and I enjoyed my stay. I didn't realize right away that the arrow controls by the door were for the exterior light-damping window shades, so learn from my ignorance! :-). I've stayed elsewhere in Berlin and though this is not a scenic part of the city per se (though elsewhere in Prenzlauer Berg is hip and lovely), you get a feel for the old East Berlin which i find very suggestive, stimulating and intriguing as a writer. And the trips I made from there to Kreuzberg and back were really fascinating. The hotel food was good, though breakfast merely average. Staff was helpful whether I spoke German or English, though perhaps somewhat more so with the former. Cabs come amazingly quickly when called by the front desk. A special treat: a few doors down is a Bulgarian restaurant.

They were very helpful in booking the room and sending me information about to reach the hotel from the airport. The hotel is in a good, quiet district. You have to take more than 1 metro to go to the center of Berlin. Otherwise, you take the tram that is in front of the hotel, arrive at central Alexanderplatz and then take another train. The first day that we arrived, we decided to go for breakfast in the hotel. The breakfast was below average (costs 10euro per person) and it didn't include any german sweets and other local food. The other 2 days, we bought coffee, sandwiches and sweets from a local shop near the hotel. Perfect quality, quite cheap. The room (second floor) was neither small nor big. We had problems with the heat, it was always cold. Even when we tried to increase the heat, it didn't work. Another problem were the pillows, too small. We asked for 2 extra and the receptionist sent us very quickly. Concluding, I was not totally satisfied with the hotel. If I had paied only 40euro per day, I would be happy. In a total of 250euro for 3days stay, you expect more. I advise to check it before booking. Make sure that the heat is OK in the room.

OK, the immeadiate surroundings are not the most scenic, unless you have a strong interest in tower blocks, but there's a tram stop and an S Bahn station within 2 minutes walk. Getting there from Schonefeld was easy - we took the S9 train to Treptower Park, then changed onto the S42 for 3 stops. (Tip - you can get the S9 to Ostkreuz but there you have a long walk to the S42 platform. At Treptower the platforms are adjacent.) Our room was large, comfortable and well furnished, but what would hotel designers do without pale lemon paint and beech furniture? The bathroom was small by comparison but very well set out to make the best use of space. We didn't take breakfast at the hotel (available for 10 Euros), but being cheapskates took a kettle and made use of the Kamps bakery in the shopping centre next door - ace pastry selection! By the way, the Lidl supermarket others have mentioned has now closed, but die hard fans need only hop on the SBahn for 2 stops to Prenzlauer Allee. Prenzlauer Berg is excellent for bars and restaurants - we particularly liked 'Frida Kahlo' and 'Endlos' - but if you want to stay local without using the hotel restaurant, the shopping centre has options. There's an Italian restaurant, or for something a bit different, a Bulgarian. Also, there's a 24 hour Kebab place, which we used before heading back to the airport - 4 kebabs, 4 drinks and attempted conversation with locals all for 14 Euros. Overall, we were really pleased with the hotel. We didn't have much contact with the staff but when we did, found them efficient and helpful. They all speak good English and were polite enough not to cricicise my German. We would certainly consider staying here again on our next visit to Berlin. PS - many booking websites offer this hotel for 64 Euros (room only), but we booked via Worldres.com and got a discount rate of 54.

As one of the other reviewers has said, it is in the east of the city, so is in amongst run-down blocks of flats and the views aren't very inspiring! But, don't be put off. It's very near to a train station and a tram stop, and a taxi journey to the Brandenburg Gate only costs around \u00a38 (ask the receptionist to call a taxi for you). Make sure you write down the address of the hotel though, to show taxi drivers when you want to return to it, as there are TWO Park Plaza Hotels in Berlin (the other is the Park Plaza Wallstreet). On the whole we found the staff very efficient, but the levels of friendliness ranged from extremely friendly to not at all friendly! However, all of the staff spoke good English and were able to give us information on local events - we were there for the Berlin Marathon, and the staff were able to advise us about road blocks etc. The hotel was not totally what I was expecting - on its website, the communal areas sound much larger than they are! In reality, the \"bar\" is a tiny extension of the reception desk, and there are 3 or 4 tables with chairs round, then that's it (apart from the restaurant, which is rather canteen like). So, don't pick this hotel if you want to sit around in the lounge and meet up with friends etc. There is, however, a small cafe/restaurant next door, a supermarket just up the road (for water and snacks) and a kebab shop and internet cafe around the corner. Our room was large and spotlessly clean, with a really nice bathroom, and was very comfortable. Our room rate did not include breakfast though, so we had to pay around \u00a38 extra (each). We did this on the first day, but then for the remainder of our stay we went to the supermarket and bought fruit and bread etc instead - much cheaper! Our room was equipped with a kettle - first time ever I've seen one, in a continental hotel! There's also a fridge (containing the mini bar) that you can buy milk and then keep in there. Oh, one more thing - on our arrival, there was a little packet of Harribo on our pillows!

The room was very nice, bed was so comfortable that we didn't want to get up. View wasn't fantastic, but we literally only used the room for sleeping, so this did not matter much to us. Only had breakfast once at the hotel for 10euros per person. The usual- cereals, yoghurts, scrambled egg, meatballs, etc. Very nice. Staff were also friendly, but were once given an evil look by a receptionist (who was on the phone) when we came out of the lift chatting... The location was extremely good for transport, the s-bahn and tram stop just around the corner from the hotel (you need the 'Landsberger Allee' s-bahn stop, not 'Storkower St' ; if you're taking tram it's the the same again, and not 'peterberg st/landsberger allee') There wasn't much going on at all by the hotel itself, so we felt like we had to stay out the whole day, since it wasn't worth popping back to the hotel in the middle of the day cos there was nothing to do in that area. Overall a very good hotel, just not close to anything of interest. Be prepared to travel. If we hadn't been in such a hurry, and done more research,we would have chosen something more central because when we got back in the evenings, the area by the hotel was very quiet, quite eerie, no people around. 5.80 euros for a day ticket (use this on S & U-bahn and the trams aswell).
