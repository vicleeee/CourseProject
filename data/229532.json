Upon arriving at the hotel around 7am, my room was not yet ready but they allowed me to check-in and keep my bags for me. Since I was with a colleague and her room was ready already, I kept my bags in her room instead. I stayed on the 1st floor -- 2nd floor to Americans -- in a Single Room. My colleague had the same Single Room on the 5th floor. Though small, which is typical of hotel rooms in Paris, my room was very comfortable. I think because my room was on the first floor, I had higher ceilings and did not feel claustrophobic at all. Much different from my colleague's room, she said that she felt claustrophobic and had to open the windows at night. The room was very clean and bed very comfortable. Included in the room were a safe, a closet big enough to fit my clothes for a week, a desk, complimentary coffee and tea, and an AC unit for heating in the winter and airconditioning in the summer. The bathroom was very clean too, which is something I'm very particular about. Amenities included: shampoo, conditioner, soap, shower cap, etc. Towels were always clean as well! Shower was nice and strong and had lots of hot water! Breakfast is located in the basement. Choices range from boiled or scrambled eggs, different cheeses, a variety of meats and sausages, cereals, fruit, yoghurt, croissants, bread, juices. I'm absolutely in love with pain au chocolat so I had that every morning! The cheeses were really good as well! Not much of a coffee drinker so my complimentary instant coffee in the room was fine for me. Was told though if you order decaf coffee in the breakfast area, you get instant but regular coffee is brewed. All the staff at Duminy-Vendome are very friendly and always wear a smile on their faces! They are also willing to help you in any way they can! The lobby always smells good too! Even from outside you can smell hints of lavender! I don't know how they do that but it's so pleasant! The location is also great! It's right in the center of Paris and walking distance to the Louvre, Place Vendome, Tuileries Gardens, Place de la Concorde, Roue de Paris, Faubourg... I love to walk so even in the winter I'd walk to Champs-Elysees, Galleries Lafayette, Opera, Madeleine... It is very convenient! Lots of cafes and restaurants in the area, a convenience store about 2 blocks away in case you want to buy water, shampoo, etc. The Tuileries Metro is also around the corner! The street is very quiet as well, which was really nice after a long day at work and all you want to do is sleep in peace. Only downside is the really tiny elevator. But not uncommon in Paris so no biggie there! As I said, I was on the 1st floor so I always took the stairs. If you have a lot of luggage though, it'll be a hassle to take them upstairs one by one. More than 2 people in the elevator is too tight for me already! Overall, I truly enjoyed my stay at Duminy-Vendome and I highly recommend it! It's not exactly the place if you're on a budget though... I think it was around Euro167 for my Single Room. But it was definitely worth it!

It was clean. This always goes a long way in my book; if a hotel isn't clean, nothing else about it is even worth considering. the common spaces and our room were clean, the mattress and sheets were clean, etc. 2. The staff were nice and spoke English very well. They were friendly, pleasant, and tried to be helpful. 3. The location is great; you're within walking distance to most of the tourist and shopping highlights of Paris, and the neighborhood is safe, walkable, and central. 4. The breakfast room is neat, and the food is decent. Now, for my criticisms, which lead me to my decision never to stay at this hotel again: 1. Noise - It was, hands down, the loudest hotel I have ever stayed at. If you do stay here, do not stay in rooms ending in \"08\" (we were in 108, but avoid any \"08\" room). The room, despite being an upgraded \"Premier\" room, shares a wall with the stairway service staff use, and with the laundry chute (which had a spring-loaded, wooden door). Any time anyone went up or down the staircase or used the chute on any floor, we heard the reverberations as if they were in our own room. Despite our complaints, the front desk would not change our room or do anything to discourage the staff from using the staircase or the laundry chute during sleeping hours. I am a very heavy sleeper, and this even woke me up time and time again. The windows also need updating; we heard kegs being unloaded onto the street below for the bar across the street in the wee hours of the morning. Not acceptable; we stumbled around Paris with next to no sleep because this place was SO darn loud. 2. Bathroom - The bathroom desperately needs to be updated. The tub still lacks a shower (there was a hose and shower head, but no mounting mechanism, so you had to hold the shower head/hose the whole time, or take a bath). I know showers are less common in Europe than the US, but this is not acceptable for a hotel this expensive. Also, the hair dryer mounted on the wall was welcome, but it was a horribly outdated model that required you to hold down the button the entire time to keep it on. This is a small detail, unless you have long, thick hair like me and need to dry it every morning in the winter. Then it quickly becomes a sore wrist and tangled hair. No fun. Finally, BYO shampoo and conditioner - the hotel issue shampoo turned my hair to straw. 3. The staff made us a restaurant reservation (upon our request via email before our trip), but told us the wrong time. We showed up at the restaurant on our final night in Paris, and the restaurant had a different time than the hotel gave us for the reservation, so we had to forgo eating at the restaurant. Disappointing. 4. Room amenities were so-so. The cable TV has three english stations, and all were news stations. Not a big deal, but certainly only average. The housekeeping staff did not replace the water in our minibar each day, which was annoying. 5. Free wifi was difficult to log into, (because there were also pay options for faster download speeds) and the password changed too often. The staff had to personally deliver the password to your room, which was a bit odd. On the whole, nothing catastrophic, but there are too many other options in central Paris at this price point to justify going to this hotel again.

Rooms are fairly basic and our room wasn't decorated as funkily as some of the pictures, but they are clean and comfortable and you are not compromising on room standard for a central location, which is often the trade off. The location is excellent, 2 minutes from Tuileries metro station and just off the Rue du Rivoli, yet tucked away down a backstreet. We arrived late, around midnight, and were checked in and welcomed very efficiently. We were also asked if everything was OK with our stay on check out, which was a nice touch which you don't always get (some hotels seem unaware that dissatisfied customers will just tell TripAdvisor instead!)

Unfortunately Duminy Vendome (DV) wasn't my favourite. To summarise - it was nice enough but given the rate we paid I know we could have done better. The other establishments we stayed at were a similar rate, however, the properties were far nicer and a feeling of 4-5 star versus the 3 star of Duminy. *Location: The location of DV was great in terms of accessing the major attractions e.g. Notre Dame and Louvre and the famed shopping of Champs Alysee. These were all 5 or so minutes stroll (depending on the density of tourists - this could extend to 10 mins if the hordes were out) so it was quite relieving to know at the end of a day of miles of walking you only had a few minutes stroll back to the Hotel. Additionally, cafes and shopping were all around. The cafes located along the main-street nearby were mostly frequented by tourists. Husband and I preferred to venture the back/side streets to cafes which were mostly smaller but had more of a 'local' feel. *Hotel property: The DV is located in an older building, however, despite the age of the property I felt DV lacked style and flair exuding a bland atmosphere. Our rooms were very clean as was the remainder of the Hotel i.e. foyer, passage-ways and breakfast room, however, there was were constant reminders of the hotel's age. I don't usually scan for tell-tale signs, however, you couldn't miss old skirtings, peeling wall-paper and musty smell/feeling in the rooms and hallway. Renovations are currently taking place and looks to be a big project. I wouldn't stay again for this reason alone. Although cleanliness is a priority (which was definitely met) I prefer an establishment that reflects taste and smartness versus tired and old. *Hotel staff: I had read some very favourable reviews about the DV staff and this was re-inforced with the friendly and prompt email I received from Lauren, prior to our visit. On arrival we promptly sought to up-grade our room for space reasons. This request was very promptly accommodated and we were more than happy with the spacious 'privilege' room. Generally the staff were pleasant and obligingly offered help if it was sought. However, it was disappointing to note reception staff frequently huddled and exuded an air of aloofness. I am used to staff offering up at least an acknowledgement or friendly hello when in the presence of guests, without being intrusive. In the case of DV I felt staff were aloof and didn't engage with guests unless they had to. I also thought it somewhat unprofessional to see 3 staff smoking immediately outside the establishment in what must have been a tea/smoko break. I would have thought there was a delegated area for such breaks without the invasion of guests peering on - I guess space is at a premium. *Breakfast: Nice enough. Once again I am not being overly fussy, I guess it was natural that I compared with other properties we stayed at during our Paris stay. I usually love breaking out while on holiday including pastry-ing every morning. In this instance I didn't bother much with the croissants or other pastries. They weren't any different to our super-market baked variety back home. The staff were pleasant and quickly accommodated our requests. Conclusively, although the location hit the mark, the property (including staff) showed a complete absence of style and flair. On this basis I wouldn't stay again - we paid 200 euro per night for a room privelege (king-size bed spacious but tired).", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Osasco, SP", "Title": "\u201cWe like it\u201d", "Author": "C\u00e9lia S", "ReviewID": "UR116649170", "Content": "We were at the hotel in May 2011.

It is a small, comfortable, clean, wonderful little hotel. We had a triple room, which was much bigger than we expected. It had a full sized bath, with a tub and shower combo. The room and bath were spotless, the beds were warm and comfortable and the staff was friendly and extremely helpful. We stayed in room 301 and 101, respectively. The rooms were identical. The room, while not overly large, was plenty big enough for three adults. The \"third\" bed is a real bed, not a cot. We \"peaked\" into the room next door when the door was open and being cleaned by a maid. The tiny room had one double bed. The end of the bed was about 2 feet from the door and about 2 feet from the wall on each side. Even though it was very, very small, it also looked cozy and spotless. For me, it would be perfectly adequate for a couple. The elevators are TINY and barely fit three people - two with luggage. The location is across the street from Jardin Tulierre and the Louvre and down the block from Place du Concord. It is steps from several wonderful cafes and close to transit. It is walking distance to the Siene and Pont Neuf. If you are ready for a good stroll, it is walking distance to all the city-center sights, including Notre Dame, Saint Chapelle and D'Orsay. The location is superb for a first-timer in Paris. It is very centrally located. The staff at this hotel are amazing. To a person, they were friendly, welcoming, helpful and polite. They recommended a couple of eating spots, gave directions, and called a taxi to get us back to the airport. Be advised, that if you reserve a taxi ahead of time, you pay an extra 9+ Euro charge. We were not brave enough to try getting back to Charles De Gaulle by train, because we were afraid to get lost and miss our flight. This was silly. The hotel is a short-medium walk to the RER, which would have gotten us directly to CDG. The distance is just far enough that if you have more than one rolling suitcase, it will be difficult to walk.

The metro is about 50 meters around the corner and will take you anywhere you need to get to including Gare du Nord (Eurostar terminal) and the airports - note though that we did not find a single train station that was luggage or pram friendly - loads of stairs, so be prepared to carry your luggage up stairs. The gardens (Jardins du Tuilleries) are 1 block away - was a great place to take our 4 year old son every day to run around. Make sure you try the macaroons from Angelinas before heading to the park. They are to die for! The gardens lead to the Lourve where all the action is and on the opposite end of the gardens, that same road becomes the Champs Elysee that ends at the Arc du Triumph. All within walking distance. The best place to shop is Galleries LaFayette. There are 3 entire blocks worth of shops and is about a 2-3 block walk from the hotel.

The quiet room we were allocated (room 001, which has a view of the courtyard, as we requested). The facilities in the room included a mini-bar (\u20ac3.00 for a soft drink, \u20ac4.00 for a beer), trouser press and a flat screen tv.

Negatives: Our room was a little cramped and had a normal size (4 feet) double bed, rather than a king (5 feet) or super-king (6 feet) sized bed There was no safe for us to use in the room, something we've got accustomed to when travelling around Europe and the USA.

Arrived early Sunday morning in Paris and went straight to the hotel. The front desk clerk had a room ready for me and upgraded me to the Privilege room for free. Pretty nice of her! This is a more expensive room and is really big for European standards and was facing the courtyard; very quiet. Of course, all older hotels in Europe have thin walls, so you can sort of hear the next door neighbor's plumbing sometimes or if they talk really loud, but otherwise, I highly recommend getting an inner courtyard room if you want quiet. The rooms are updated and have the regular amenities; air conditioning, coffee pot, steam press, hair dryer, etc. If you want the Ritz Hotel style of living (just 2 blocks around the corner), then this isn't the place for you. If you want a great value, clean comfortable room, and the best location in Paris, then I suggest you book a room at Duminy Vendome. The hotel is situated on a quiet backstreet off of Rue De Rivoli, a main road, nested near the Westin, Renaissance, and other 5 star hotels. If this is your first time in Paris, I highly recommend staying here. The location is absolutely prime! And I mean PRIME! The metro is literally a 2 minute walk away, you can walk to the Louvre in 7 minutes. The only downside is that the restaurants and cafes are all kind of expensive around here because it's in a really nice part of town, so my wife and I either walked to the Opera district for cheaper restaurants (there are no cheap restaurants in Paris) or got on the metro and within 15 minutes we were in the St Germain district. There are two major tour companies just around the corner from Duminy Vendome where you can schedule city tours, Seine river cruises, day trips to Versailles, etc. Again, this is the very best location you can stay at in Paris. This is important because some of the day trips out of Paris leave very early in the morning, so the convenience of having the pickup point just around the block is really nice. I guarantee you will say to yourself...damn, this hotel location is the best and you can either walk or take the metro and be at all the sites within 15 minutes. Of course you'll go see Notre Dame and Sacre Couer, Louvre, and all the regular tourist stuff...but I highly recommend going to Palace of Versailles on a full day trip and pay the extra 9 euros to see the Marie Antoinette hamlet and Petit/Grand Trianon mansions on the outer gardens of Versailles. There is this little country village that Marie Antoinette had constructed for her own amusement and it has a working farm, fish pond, and looks like it came right out of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. It's really neat! Also, if you are around on a Saturday, take a train out to Vaux Le Vicomte chateaux (about an hour train ride). Smaller than Versailles, but really neat. The story behind this place is that the treasurer of France, Fouquet, built this spectacular mansion in the 17th century and had a big party after completing it and invited King Louis XIV over. King Louis XIV was so impressed and jealous, that he drummed up some fake charges that Fouquet was imbezzling money from France and had him imprisoned immediately, sentenced him to life in prison, stole all the furniture, tapestries, artwork, and then got the architect and gardener who designed Vaux Le Vicomte to go and build himself a grander place...yes...this place was the inspiration for Palace of Versailles. It gets better, Louis supposedly placed an iron mask on Fouquet in prison...and you may have heard this story before because...a French writer named Alexander Dumas used this story to write Man in the Iron Mask and Count of Monte Cristo. Totally awesome place like Versailles! Got to go to both places! The best value restaurant we came across in Paris that a friend of my wife's took us to was in the Opera district. The restaurant serves all dishes related to duck (foie grois, roast duck, etc.) and you can get a dinner for 9 euros, bottle of wine for 6 euros, and the food is really good. It's called Domaine Lintillac, 10 rue Saint-Augustin 75002. In the St. Germaine district (in my opinion, the nicest part of Paris), I recommend Peres Et Filles, 81 Rue de Seine, 75006 paris for good food, little bit more expensive than the other place. And just around the corner from Peres Et Filles, eat at Paul bakery for bread and pastries and Amorino for the best 4 euro gelato on earth. Oh yes, try the coconut gelato, you will thank me. Don't worry about trying to find a good cheap restaurant in Paris; they're all expensive. Like my parents told me before I left, whatever money you are thinking of bringing on the trip, just double it, and they were pretty much right. By far, this was the most expensive place I've ever been to but the city and sights are so beautiful, it's like \"c'est la vie!\" and just enjoy the good food and parisian life and have fun!", "Date": "October 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hull, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "Jaxes", "ReviewID": "UR5614006", "Content": "We stayed at the Duminy Vendome for 5 days and had a great stay.

Having made our reservations months before, and confirming them again 2 days prior, we expected no problems. The hotel itself is located in good position. The T. gardens are a quick walk away. There's an Irish pub just down the street and a market about a block away. The hotel lobby is small and crowded, the elevator is quite frankly a joke. You can only fit 2 persons with luggage and it's excrutiatingly slow..Better to take the stairs, however...that being said, taking the stairs is a feat unto itself...Better hold the rails and go slowly.. The \"lounge\" reminded me of what a house of ill repute might look like....The red color, the fringy lampshades...very tacky and definitely not my cup of tea. Still waiting on reception, we decided to head down the stairs to where the breakfast area was. Definitely not quaint as described by some, but more like the basement with old furniture and tacky wall coverings nailed into the wall to cover up who knows what. Breakfast itself was adequate. There was ample food, so lots of choices, but somehow not an \"experience\" I would say was enjoyable. It's not as if you'd want to linger other than to eat. Finally! Receptionist deems to help us. Gives our room keys. My husband asks politely.....\"the children are in adjoining rooms as requested? No...\"Are they across the hall?\" Very close.....No! 10 doors between us around the corner and their room was right across from the lift.

The Hotel Duminy Vendome is very central -- right across from Jardin Tuilieres (sp?) -- so we were close enough to everything and on a metro line (when the walking started to poop us out). Our room was your standard European room: High ceilings, thin walls, small space -- but very nice. Bathroom is a little outdated but otherwise clean -- the tub was a bit of a climb to get into though! Toiletries were always restocked and general housekeeping was very good. The room was more than sufficient for the limited time we spent in it. My only advice is try to request a room that doesn't face the street. Although it's not a busy street, you'll hear all the late-night rowdiness through those thin walls/windows -- especially if you're a light sleeper. Front desk staff is helpful to a degree. Don't ask for a wake-up call -- they won't remember. Didn't eat the breakfast in the hotel. It didn't seem worth the $$ when there are plenty of cafes around the corner. General Paris advice/opinions: If you're planning your first trip to Paris and only have a couple of days, my advice is skip the Louvre (you can do that on the next trip -- trust me, you'll come back to Paris) and go to the Musee d'Orsay right across the river from the Jardin Tulieres. Great impressionist works (Monet, Van Gogh, etc.) and not as intimidating as the Louvre for your first trip. The museum is in an old train station -- it's a beautiful building. Also, if you're looking for that postcard-perfect photo of Paris, climb the 300+ steps at Notre Dame to get a breathtaking view of the city -- Eiffel Tower included. Why climb the Eiffel to get a view of Paris? I mean, without the Eiffel Tower in the picture, it's just another photo of another city! The tower is far more interesting (and photo-worthy) from the ground looking up.", "Date": "January 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "long beach, ca", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location--Huge Room\u201d", "Author": "Erickrop", "ReviewID": "UR4218549", "Content": "We just return from Paris and stayed five days at the Duminy Vendome.

It is also near designer stores, which are great for window-shopping if you are in our price bracket. A buffet breakfast was included in the package we bought, and is served in the hotel's basement. There was a good variety of food offered. There were also provisions for coffee or tea in our room. The hotel appears to have been recently redecorated, and was plenty warm for cold winter days. The elevator was small, but will just hold four people. We didn't experience noise from the street, but sometimes we heard people in the next room or in the hall.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel. The hotel staff were very friendly and very helpful. One young guy (who was always smiling and engaging) even gave me his e-mail address in case I had questions regarding my next visit (scheduled for February). The maids were friendly and thorough. My room was clean, although it could use a little updating. For example, the bedspread had a small stain and was pilled. Some scuffs on the walls. The walls were thin, but it's Europe. I heard none of the water noises reported by some people. The room was average size (small), but it wasn't laid out very well, and didn't feel exactly comfortable. The location is PHENOMENAL. Just across the street from the Tuileries Garden and Metro stop (which is well connected with the other lines). Moments away from the Louvre, Angelinas (best hot chocolate ever), Place Vendome and Rue St. Honore (great high end shopping), Place de la Concorde. Beautiful, safe location; plenty of restaurants and cafes open late. Quiet in the evenings. I would stay here again if I wanted to be in this location. By the way, I discovered that the package I bought through an internet website (beginning with [--]) was grossly overpriced compared to what I would have paid if I had only called the hotel. Oh well, live and learn. Finally, I have only had positive interactions with the French people. I am more and more convinced that we get what we give, and that sometimes we are not aware of what we are putting out into the world. Pick up \"French or Foe\" by Polly Platt; learn to ask simply for what you need in French. I have had many wonderful interactions with Parisians who have gone the extra mile to help me or just to connect with me, just by showing an interest in their language and their social cues. I can't wait to go back.

The Duminy Vendome was a clean, comfortable, quiet hotel that did what we needed it to do. As other reviewers stated, the location is perfect. You are in the middle of wherever you want to go. The metro stop (Toulleries) is moments away. The hotel is a small 5 story hotel tucked away on a small side street behind Rue de Rivoli. The elevator is tiny; 3 people maximum. Had to take 2 trips with the luggage. No big deal though. We never ate breakfast in the hotel...there are patisseries and fruit stands on Rue St. Honore (1 block away) and each morning we tried all sorts of things...baguettes, cheese, yogurt, fruit and croissants. All wonderful and cheaper than the hotel breakfast. We stayed on the 4th floor, the a/c was fine, and the room did what we wanted it to do. It had enough space, but very little furniture to unpack our things. My husband hung his things up, I lived out of my suitcase. The bathroom was marble, had a bathtub with a shower curtain and was clean. The only true negative that impacted us was the front desk staff. We called and asked them how to use the Metro to get to the hotel from the airport. They gave us the wrong stop off of the RER and we couldn't transfer to the Metro. It caused us some distress, but we worked it out. The staff are not concierges, they are young kids. We asked about a tour about the Opera Garnier and the answer was \"I don't know\". I would have expected more. That being said, if you are looking for a central location, with decent amenities this hotel will do quite nicely. If you need a lot of help with your sightseeing, pick another place with better services.

A warning about restaurants STAY AWAY from the chinese across the road from the hotel!!!!!! food is good when it eventually comes, they have coach loads of chinese tourists who ALL get served first...... also they botched our order, and ignored us when we mentioned it!!! Great shop for shoes around the corner!!! LES BELLES AFFAIRES. Be careful on checkout, they where charging us \u20ac90 for breakfast which we didn't have. but had no problem when brought to their attention. oh one other thing.... windows have VERY small guards which a small child could easily climb, so ask for a lower floor if staying with children.
