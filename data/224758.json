OK the corridors had a little smell of damp but they were clean, the room we got was very clean and had everything we needed. It is only a 5 min walk to Gants hill underground (which is on the central line) 15 mins to Stratford and within 40 mins and we were in central London (its actually in zone 4). As with all Travelodges no food (except a warmed sandwich or a packed breakfast) but the harvester is next door and there are other eateries in the nearby area. But we were out early into London and usually not back until late. The staff were very freindly and helpful especially the lady on reception with the long dark hair. We heard no undue noise from the pub or surrounding area.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeware!\u201d", "Author": "Gareth306", "ReviewID": "UR125278317", "Content": "Items stolen from car park, CCTV out of operation.

So here are the facts. 1. This hotel shares its 10 space car park with a busy Harvester restaurant 2. We were only able to get 2 pillows between the 3 people in our party 3. To hotel clearly has not been decorated in a long time 4. There is no noise control and dispite shouting and screaming throughout both nights of our two night stay nothing was done about it.# 5. There is no breakfast facilities, but you can order a microwaved sandwich (we did not) In my opinion Would not touch this place again with a barge pole. A dive an not suitable to carry the travel-lodge branding. the facilities a poor and it is not very clean. It is full with noisy drunken people and there is no one to police it. Despite us paying for 3 people to stay there they could not supply even basic amenities like enough pillows, tea, coffee, mugs or towels. Good points The hotel staff tried their best but they clearly dont have the tools to work with. Oh and if you like the smell of Febreze you will love this place and the whole hotel smells like its been douched in the stuff.

The hotel is in need of a complete overhall and is starting to resemble the london doss houses that you specifically choose travelodge to avoid. Where do you start? There is a pervading odour of cigarette smoke in the corridors The rooms smell damp Fixtures and fittings in the bathrooms are rusty The tiles in the bathroom are old and cracked and look like they were a left over job lot used to decorate British rail toilets in the 80's - what a horrible design - stick to plain white! The place is generally dirty and poorly cleaned I was pretty surprised when I lay on the bed to start rocking backwards and so decided to look underneath only to find on one side a leg missing completely, replaced by a large pile of towels to prop the bed up and on the other side the leg was hanging off and offering no support. As it was midnight, I was dog tired and had unpacked I decided to use the dust bin as a support to get a stable night sleep instead of complaining and getting moved to another room. This hotel is a disgrace. The only redeeming features are it is colose to the tube network, there is a pub next door and the man in the chinese take away across the road is extremely friendly and gives you a plate and cutlery if he knowes you are staying in the hotel.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham", "Title": "\u201cVery basic\u201d", "Author": "MagicFamily", "ReviewID": "UR33307843", "Content": "A trip to London on business is always tricky when it comes to working out whether to drive and park in the centre or park on the outside and catch the Tube.

We arrived at 4pm, being greeted by a less than informative and a somewhat un-enthusiastic receptionist, located at a reception desk in what could best be described as a dilapidated, tired and run down building in a less than salubrious part of London suburbia. No information was provided about the attached (Harvester) restaurant regarding meal and breakfast times and availability. The allocated ground floor room was the normal Travelodge layout with a double bed, sofa bed, TV, tea making facilities and en-suite bathroom. This room had clearly seen better days as it was definitely in need of some severe renovation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or preferably, demolition. First, the bathroom; this featured a bath with chipped and worn enamel, detached bath plug and a wide range of black mould in residence around the tiles. It appeared that the toilet bowl had escaped the attention of bleach, disinfectant and a toilet brush for quite a while. The bedroom area was in a similar \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 condition. Of the six castors on the bed, the majority were broken. The pillows, although encased in pillowcases, featured a wide range of staining throughout. To continue the ambience, the curtains appeared to have been there since the place was built and again appeared not to have been washed since then. The kettle interior featured an unusual calcite feature as its centre piece and also sported a variety of black speckles to complement the calcite. To complete the tea making facilities, two unmatched cups of different sizes sat nearby, again with a poor standard of cleanliness. The socket for the telephone, was also hanging off the wall. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get round to trying the TV. The carpet didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like it had seen a Hoover for years, especially around the edges and under the malformed bed lay a nice supply of antique dust. Indeed, bodily parts from a previous resident, in the form of toe nail clippings, were still visible on the floor. The carpet also featured various stains of unknown origin. The wall also had a worrying brown stain on it as well which was not due to damp \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t investigate further. Now don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong, I appreciate that these are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbudget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rooms so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect all mod cons and facilities. I have used Travelodge many times before and am aware that consumables such as soap etc are not provided so I have no issues with that, however I do expect an acceptable level of hygiene and cleanliness especially from such a large chain, regardless of the cost. In all honesty, I have never experienced a Travelodge room as bad as this before. I have photos of all these delights but have chosen not to post them so as not to contravene the 'family friendly' requirement !! Faced with these horrors, at 4:30pm we left, having secured a room in a nearby Premier Travelinn (a competitor in the budget hotel market). On leaving, as we left we raised our complaint and disgust with the receptionist. As she made no effort to have our concerns addressed by either offering another room or having things cleaned and fixed, I would suspect our\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was not the first complaint \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nor is it likely to be the last. She promised me that the manager would phone me to discuss our complaint (he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t) as she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a complaint form and we were not prepared to wait around any longer while she did. In summary \u00e2\u20ac\u201c avoid like The Plague \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 or catch it (The Plague that is !) at Gants Hill Travelodge !! POSTSCRIPT: Travelodge have responded to my complaint, apologising for the poor standard/cleanliness and advised that Gants Hill is due for refurbishment towards the end of 2008.
