We were groggy from jet lag so we forgot to look for the hotel bus. The taxi cost 27 euros. We saw a stewardess waiting outside the hotel so if the airline personnel stay here, it must be decent. Even though we arrived at 11 am (before the normal check-in), our room was ready. The hotel and room deserve 4 stars. The metro stop was only two blocks away. The hotel is located in a business park and there were no nearby restaurants which were open on Sunday. If we were familiar with the metro, we could have taken it from the airport only two stops to the hotel. To my surprise the metro ran frequently even though it was Sunday. The front desk was helpful in finding the closest metro stop to the Sorolla Museum we wanted to see. The next day we did take the free bus to the airport. It leaves from the hotel every half hour. Our only complaint is that the order card said room service was available 24 hours a day and we ordered breakfast to be delivered at 5 am. When we called for the wake-up call, we told the front desk we wanted breakfast at 5 am, and he instructed us to leave the order card on our door knob. When they called to wake us up at 4:30 am (Monday Aug 27, 2012), they said they could not bring breakfast because the dining room opened at 6 am. When we went downstairs, wait staff had arrived at 5 am and the breakfast buffet was available. If the front desk had told us this, we would have just gone downstairs for breakfast at 5:00 or 5:15 am. For this reason, we are rating this hotel \"average\" rather than \"very good\" or \"excellent\".", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and good start to our holiday!\u201d", "Author": "Margoatnumbersix", "ReviewID": "UR138294929", "Content": "We stayed here for one night at the start of our holiday.

It's a bit more expensive than the other hotels in the neighborhood, but what a difference that makes. In the US, you would pay easily close to double the amount for this high-end hotel. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful, the lay-out is nice and the interior looks very chique. The rooms though are above my expectations: roomy, with a electric roll-down screen that truly darkens your room against the bright Spanish sun. The bathroom is bliss! Equipped with an all-shower heads shower and all the amenities you need. I found my room quiet, even when there was a wedding ceremony and party outside near the pool. I never heard them. I don't think there were many guests in the hotel, so I never hear my neighbor. The restaurant is kind of small, but sufficient. It has a nice feel to it. Food is good. Breakfast was above average and tasteful. The free airport shuttle takes you first to another hotel for guest pick-up and then goes to the airport. Allow at least 20 minutes from hotel to the international terminal and inquire when the bus leaves. The bus chauffeur did not help me with my luggage. The location of the hotel is kind of boring, so if you think you'll go out for a nice stroll... It's in the middle of a business district that is plain dead after business hours. This is a very good hotel for arriving, eating in the hotel, sleeping and leaving again. There is a metro stop very close by (less than 5 minute walk) which will bring you to the center for Madrid (but you will have to change metro lines a couple of times).

We came a few days early and stayed at another hotel in center city, then moved out to this hotel. When we checked in, the guy at the front desk told us that breakfast was included in our room. The next morning, when we arrived at breakfast, the hostess told us that only one breakfast was included and we'd have to pay nearly $25USD for the other breakfast. Reluctantly, we paid the money since there is very little around the hotel. The breakfast was fine, but not $25USD worth. I'm not a very big person, and I shouldn't be much of a threat to a buffet proprietor, so I felt like they should have just let me eat some of the fruit and torta and call it a day. It would have been good customer service just to let me eat breakfast without this outlandish charge. I did not feel like a valued guest so I took my money elsewhere for my remained breakfasts. You might be asking yourself, where did she go for breakfast? The answer is far, far away. Why? Because there's really nothing around the hotel. The second morning of our stay, I slept in and, famished from a long night of sleep, went looking for breakfast. I walked, and walked, and walked some more. I stopped into a couple of restaurants about a 10-15 walk away, but none of them served breakfast.

The streets and sidewalks were deserted for the weekend (so of course, it was very quiet\u2014another advantage to the location). It took us about thirty minutes to reach Puerta del Sol on the Metro. We pulled up to the hotel and were almost immediately greeted by a doorman who helped unload luggage from the car. He helpfully suggested storing a few items that we would not need, which reduced the clutter in our room. The receptionist was polite and efficient. Our room looked slightly more worn than the stylish lobby. Furnishings and fixtures had a used appearance, but everything was absolutely clean and functional. The bed was firm and the sheets felt wonderful. The hotel also supplied a comfortable extra bed for one of our children. The room was a bit cramped for two adults and two children, but otherwise we enjoyed the stay.

The breakfast room, lobby bar and restaurant are also smaller than you might expect and can feel cramped during busy periods. Breakfast is a cold buffet, consisting of a dreary selection of chopped fruit, breads, cold meats, cheeses and pastries, none of which is particularly good. There is supposedly a hot option but no one seems to order it and the staff certainly do not encourage guests to do so. Breakfast costs all of 25 Euros and is a complete rip off at that price. The bar offers a very small selection of tapas. These are OK, but be prepared to wait because the service here is very slow, even by Madrid standards. The service in the restaurant is slightly better but the food is nothing special. One of the worst things about this hotel is its location. Convenient for the airport, yes, being just a short cab ride away; but it is also slap bang in the middle of the most boring part of Madrid. If you want to see the real city then you\u2019ve a choice between taking a taxi (expensive) and travelling on the Metro. The Metro station is just round the corner from the hotel, but you still have a 30-minute to one-hour journey to most of the places of interest. I have read some disparaging remarks about the service at this hotel. On the whole I found it to be okay but no better than it needs to be. One slip up occurred on our penultimate day when the maids forgot to make up the room. We were hoping that the management would offer us a late checkout for the following day (to 14:00) in compensation, but nothing was doing. Normally I would give this type of hotel three stars, but the ungracious attitude re the late checkout and the rip-off price of the breakfast has cost it a star in my evaluation.

And breakfast was very disappointing, with a few very sweet breads, some fruit, and not to fresh looking cereal, @ 25 euro!", "Date": "July 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location near the airport\u201d", "Author": "Sus63", "ReviewID": "UR5315553", "Content": "Great location for your last night in Spain if you want to be 5 minutes from the airport. They do have a free shuttle into Madrid, but the availability is limited and it is only one way. They have a very convenient free shuttle from the hotel to the airport. Only took 5 minutes. Very low stress way to spend your last night before flying home. The hotel room was fantastic. High end bed and bedding. Large marble bathroom. Walking distance to a small mall with a Corte Ingles, grocery store and some restaurants. Also close to a park. They do have a business center with internet access - kind of pricey and the printers had no ink. I tried to print my boarding passes and couldnt. Instead of just loading the ink, they refunded by 4 Euro fee for 15 minutes of internet usage. You can get internet access from your room for 10 Euro for the day as well.", "Date": "June 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "ludiandrade", "ReviewID": "UR4174438", "Content": "Stayed at the Madrid Sofitel post-cruise Nov 12, 2005. They offer free shuttle pick up and drop-off to the Madrid-Barajas Airport. You must call from the airport for them to send the shuttle. Check in was quick and the luggage arrived immediatley to our rooms. Excellent service from the staff. We had only one day in Madrid and the front staff arranged a taxi for us (party of 6). However, he later discovered there was a manisfestation going on and and told the taxi driver to leave and suggested we take the metro (train) for safety reasons. The hotel and rooms are beautifully decorated and very clean. Only a couple of minor things I may mention: the hair dryers provided are of very poor quality - looks more like a vacuum so bring you own. The tub sits too high above the floor which makes it a little dangerous when getting in and especially out of the tub. I fell and injured my knee and shoulder. No drinking water is provided in the rooms. The phones were difficult to operate - we couldn't call others in our party. We requested a wake up call expecting to have the phone ring at the requested time, instead their wake up service is a gentlemen that knocks on your and everyone else's door at the designated times. Maybe the phones weren't working? The Cafe con Leche in the lobby cafe is excellent and reasonably priced - don't forget to try that! Other than that, our stay was very pleasant and would definitately return to this hotel. One more thing, you will probably get a better rate going onto the Sofitel website than using booking engines.", "Date": "December 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWhat airport?\u201d", "Author": "lbalad", "ReviewID": "UR3834604", "Content": "If you want a high class hotel away from the noise of downtown,look no further!.Whilst only 5 mins from airport by free shuttle bus,I never saw or heard a single plane.It is situated in a new business district,which last weekend was quiet,maybe busier during week.Metro is 5 mins walk away,highly effecient,downtown in 20 mins or so.As mentioned before,hotel forms part of a complex with Novotel.Each has its own outdoor pool and bar,and you are free to use either.The hotel is not high tech,but is well presented.The bedrooms feature comfy beds and linens,minibar,free safe,bathrobes and slippers,designer smellies,turn down service with sweets and weather forecast.Breakfast is buffet style,with your choice of hot selection waitress served.Obviously bar and restaurant prices are not the cheapest,but when you stay somewhere as classy as this,to be expected.Very impressed overall!.", "Date": "August 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cExtremely comfortable, well staffed hotel.

We took the train in from Valencia and the trip was awful, so we were frazzled by the time we got to the hotel. This promptly melted away as we were greeted with an elegant business hotel surrounded by mahogany and old paintings. The floors were marble. The woman at reception spoke very good English and it was evident from the way she spoke that she learned English in Ireland. We were given a room with two single beds by mistake but it was corrected with a smile and with no problems whatsoever. The beds are covered in soft, pillowy Italian linens and are incredibly comfortable. The bathroom is spacious and comes with personal grooming kits and brand name soaps and beauty supplies (for the ladies). There was also a complimentary bottle of spring water on ice when we got there. Although we didn't use the pool, it looked clean and well maintained. The breakfast buffet was included in the price of our room and was quite good with lots of choices. The restaurant had a nice nautical feel to it (dark wood, emerald carpet, deep red leather chairs) which was obviously fitting as it is a seafood restaurant. Overall, this was a comfortable, first class experience. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll definitely stay here before the flight home. A mere 10 minutes from the airport and shuttles running every 30 minutes is astoundingly convenient.", "Date": "August 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cComfy Beds!

My one issue was with the room service--there was very little selection and what we did order was tasteless and extremely overpriced.
