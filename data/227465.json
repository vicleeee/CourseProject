In the daytime this street was fine. The hotel itself is modern and has a gym and sauna (which we didn't use). The room we had was, although small, comfortable and clean. Bathroom was modern with a lovely power shower. We had a rear facing room which looked out onto the rear of another building which wasn't ideal, but then how much time do you actually spend in your room? The bed was comfortable which is all that really matters. The only negative was the lack of tea/coffee making facilities. The staff were polite and helpful, especially on checkout when there was a problem with the rate we were charged for one of the rooms.

Excellent location for public tranport routes. The bus stop is directly outside and the Metro (Paral.Lel) is less than a minute walk away. This hotel is small and modern with a lovely roof terrace overlooking the city. It is classed as 4 star but would say it is more 2- 3 star. Clean modern rooms but the beds are very uncomfortable and small. We stayed in a twin room at the back of the hotel which meant there was hardly any street noise but the soundproofing in the hotel is very poor and spent the first 2 nights being kept awake by the loud snores of the man in the next room. I reported this to reception and for the next 2 nights no one else was booked into the room next door. You can hear the rumble of the Metro but this stops at midnight and got used to it after the first night.The sockets in the wall were loose, so extra care had to be taken. The rooms didn't have tea/coffee making facilities which was greatly missed, especially after a long day of sightseeing.The reception staff were very pleasant and the breakfast area looked very inviting although we didn't try it (too expensive) We read a lot of reports prior to arriving in Barcelona stating that the area in which this hotel is situated (El Raval) is somewhere to be desired and can be a bit dodgy. However, we thought it was a great location in order get to all the main sights, there are plenty of bars and places to eat. Thoroughly recommend Los Cachitos on the corner for breakfast and evening meal, Bar Moritz across the street for a drink is cheap and quiet. You will be spoilt for choice. The Sant Antoni market is a 10 minute walk away. As two women travelling together the only time we felt uncomfortable was walking down Carrer de Sant Pau; this can be taken as a short cut from La Rambla to the hotel but half way down the street it felt unsafe and we wouldn't recommend walking down here at night. All in all the local people we very friendly, public transport is frequent, cheap and clean and the city is full of things to see and do. You will not be bored.

The location of the hotel was good. A short five / ten minute walk from one of the main tourist areas - it was therefore close to sightseeing bus routes. It was also fairly close to the train system.

It's not included in the room price. It's quite expensive unless you pre-order it from the internet as you book you room. The hotel staff was friendly and professional and they spoke many languages. Not a big deal, but I have to give them a little thumbs down for two things: they were not keen to offer any of their services, like jacuzzi, gym or breakfast. I*m not sure if all the guests realize they are entitled to little extra services, they only mention those on their website. No booklet in the room. There was also a mix up at check-out.

On arrival we were impressed with the hotel and the location seemed fine, it's located in the Theatre district so is quite busy in the evenings. We had been told to watch out for pickpockets in Barcelona and the hotel receptionist gave us an information sheet on ways to keep safe in and around the city which was vey heplful, and as when visiting anywhere you just have to be sensible and not take short cuts or walk down little side streets at night, although we did feel safe doing this during the day. Getting to La Ramblas took about 15 minutes and that is sticking to the main route going to the roundabout by the port turning left then just a short walk on another main road and you will be at the bottom of La Ramblas. The rooms in the hotel are not massive but adequate and very clean and comfortable, maid service and towels changed everyday. Air conditioning worked fine for us and as in most spanish hotels the only english channel on the TV was CNN, but who comes to Barcelona to watch TV..... It is worth getting a taxi or walking to Port Olympic as there are some lovely restaurants especially if you like seafood, it's also quite lively late into the evening although some bars can be very expensive. the bus tour of Barcelona is also worth doing 19 euros and you can get on and of as many times as you like until 9pm, also 3 different bus routes, so definatley worth the money.

Overall, we found the hotel to be of a good standard with extremely helpful staff who spoke excellent English - would we go back? Probably. The rooms were clean and pleasant (we stayed on the 5th floor and had no problem with noise from the traffic outside) - and the air conditioning (essential given the temperatures) worked well. Apart from CNN, there were no English language channels on the TV but, to be frank, we spent relatively little time in the room. The breakfast was pretty good, offering a varied selection of excellent quality. There is a rooftop sun terrace and also, it is claimed, a bar but it didn't seem to be open during our visit (not a problem given the proximity to plenty of decent places near by - do try Moritz directly opposite, which does very good tapas). The only problem we had with the hotel was that for the first night we were in close proximity to another guest who was extremely loud, aggressive and seemingly drunk. Luckily, he departed on the second day and the hotel staff were very apologetic. For the rest of the time it was an oasis of calm. The hotel is located in what could best be described as a fairly mixed, residential neighbourhood - not particularly picturesque but with the advantage of making you feel part of the local culture rather than a tourist. The big plus is that is only a 10-15 minute walk from the old port and La Ramblas with other main sites also within walking distance but.....and here is the problem....the shortest direct routes to La Rambas go through Raval which, though better than it was, can still be pretty unpleasant. For example, if you come out of the hotel turn left and walk along Carrer Sant Pau (home to Barcelona's oldest church - worth a visit), particularly near Rambla del Raval, you rapidly realise this is a far from salubrious area with drug addicts and prostitutes visible even at midday. One kindly local warned us as we walked to watch out for muggers! At night-time, I could imagine tourists are easy targets. So, some words of advice - don't carry a bag or have a camera on display and, if walking, go down towards the port and then up La Ramblas from the Columbus monument or take the longer route, via Ronda Sant Pau/Ronda Universitat and come down Las Ramblas from Placa de Catalunya. A couple of other tips - the Bus Turistic offers superb value, allowing you to hop on and off and visit all the main sites. The nearest stops to the hotel are at Place de Catalunya and the Old Port. Barcelona is full of bars and places to eat - for the former, we particularly liked the famous Boadas (just off the top of Las Ramblas); for the latter, Taller de Tapas (Placa Sant Josep) where we could have stayed all day. Also, if in the area of the Old Port, avoid the quite expensive places on the front and visit the top floor restaurant in the Museu d'Historia de Catalunya which has fantastic views over the harbour together with reasonably priced (for the quality) food and drink.", "Date": "July 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ascot", "Title": "\u201cDangerous area\u201d", "Author": "JacquelineAscot", "ReviewID": "UR7837409", "Content": "The Apsis Hotel is situated quite conveniently to the Ramblas - about 10/15 mins walk.

One an ex air hostess, the other a model and dancer. When we arrived as we got into a taxi outside the hotel my girlfriend was mugged viciously.

Another woman in our party was staying in a different hotel The Principal in calle commerc. When she walked up calle Ronda san Pau towards our hotel she had a similar attack and also clung on to her bag. I just think for a 4 * hotel they should at least have some security outside and sort out the double glazing. I could not sleep as most Spanish people appear to come back from night clubs at around 4am in the morning and the trucks and ambulances go all night. However the bedroom was nice and clean with a modern appearance. Breakfast could have been better and was indeed on the Monay of our departure with all items replenished on the buffet.

Tv was rubbish so dont try to watch it, CNN was the only english language and that almost killed us! Wolf Blizter- is that a made-up name?

I kinda enjoyed being away from La Rambla and heading off into it for dinner etc. One good thiing about the location is its simple walk to the main port and the waterfront, a nice walk down there during the day is refreshing. Facilities are not bad here, simple but comfortable bathroom and toiletries provided, good electronic safe for passports etc and it's free for a change. they have lovely spa area downstairs, sauna jacuzzi etc- no pool- but it was a booking system that to be honest we didnt bother with as there is so much to do in Barcelona. There is a great roof top \"solarium\" that you can go out to in the sunshine with reasonable views around the city.

The hotel itself was nothing special, I would agree that it perhaps is not deserving of its 4 star status.

The room service menu consists of half a dozen sandwiches and on the occasion we tried to order we were advised we couldn't have anything as \"room service was off sick\". We never saw the bar open and the rooms do not have tea/coffee making facilities. We didn't use the TV - we found it only showed Spanish speaking programs, if travelling with children beware. they have pay TV - this includes films and adult films - as you flick through the channels you get a full show for a few seconds before it asks for your confirmation.
