I stayed in La Ramblas during my last visit and this was such a wonderful change in location. You are between the Gracia and the tourist area. If you are looking to between McDonald's and Starbucks and close to the Hop on/Hop off bus..stay elsewhere. This hotel was suggested to me by locals because they hang out in Gracia...not La Ramblas. You are still a short walk to all things Gaudi but you are near wonderful local pastry shops and restaurants and true Catalonia. My suggestion: Read TIME OF THE DOVES when you stay here and take a walk to the square in Gracia that inspired the novel. The hotel has retained retro detail and old time service.

Unfortunately my girlfriend was sick during the holiday and I got sick too. What this has to do with the hotel you would say? It has to do that the temperature was way too high inside the room and we weren\u2019t able to control it due to the fact that the thermostat was disabled. Also, due to the high fever we had to order dinner in the room, some bits of seasonal fruit was 9 euro and a plate with some cheese and ham was 19euros. I found these prices to be a bit high. Apart from that I have to say the staff was nice, the position is amazing (just 5 minutes or less walk from diagonal station and therefore passeig de gracia), plenty of restaurant and all the things you may need just a few minutes walk or right outside the hotel. Also there was a phone ringing the whole night (I\u2019m not joking, when I say whole I mean whole) but to be honest we didn\u2019t ask the reception to find out from were it came.

The hotel was very clean and comfortable, the reception staff was extremely helpful in guiding me toward restaurants nearby that were ideal for a woman traveling alone. I had a delicious meal at a tapas bar/tavern just around the corner from the restaurant (to the left and left again as you exit the hotel). The room was very clean and minimalist, which I prefer.

Our travelling companion had a larger room with a really good view, so there you go! This didn't really bother us, as we only had three nights in the city so not much time was spent in the room. Overall the hotel is clean and the staff friendly.

We now wish we would have added a few more days, because as we found out 2 days was not enough. We were a little concerned when we started to drive to the hotel area that we were staying too far away from everything.. but there was a lot to do EVERYWHERE! We did have a bit of a walk to the main \"strip\" area but it was enjoyable to walk and look at all the buildings, people and everything going on there. If you did not want to walk you could easily take many means of transportation like get an all day bus pass, get a taxi or just hop on a bus. It was just a short walk to the main street to catch one. The hotel was very clean, staff very friendly.. the room size that we had was great, very large. The bathroom was also nice and big. With coming off of a boat for 2 weeks we had a lot of suitcases and it was nice to be able to put them somewhere and not be tripping over them for the 2 days we were in the room. We had a back room so we had no view, I think its kind of hard to have a nice view in Barcelona since its nothing but buildings all over the place one on top of another (unless you ask for something facing the front street) It was very quiet, we heard no noise at all from inside or outside. Beds seemed comfortable.. Funny thing to us was we had no idea on how to turn the lights and the air on. First time we were at a place that you had to put your room card in a slot to make the lights work!!! We thought the power was out to the room when we first walked in.. he he But best of all I have to say the FREE breakfast was amazing. They had such a assortment of things out it was more like a lunch buffet!! If you ate a nice size breakfast you did not have to eat lunch till late. All kinds of juices, pastries, breads and then your eggs along with ham, bacon and more.. It was worth it just for the breakfast! Our travel agent may have told us that breakfast was included but we forgot:) So it was a nice surprise when my husband went downstairs to get me juice and found that out.. So maybe you can just get the room with out breakfast included?? Not sure on that, you might want to check at time of booking if breakfast is included for sure, trust me again its worth it. Only took pictures of the outside... did want to take bathroom pictures since it was so impressive.. Oh yes and they do give you a basket full of things left in your bathroom; luffah sponge, nail file, soap, shampoo, conditioner, comb, tooth brush, toothpaste, shoe shine kit and that type of stuff. I took the luffa and packed it in my suitcase the first day to give to someone at home as a joke (actually a nice size one) and the next day there was another one there!! NICE!!! I would recommend this and stay there again.", "Date": "December 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarasota, Florida, USA", "Title": "\u201cCatalonia Corsega Hotel.

It is a lovely business style hotel. Inviting lobby, comfortable and clean rooms, large marble bath, mini fridge, and COLD air conditioning. STaff was polite and helpful. Got a rate of 75 euros on the Internet. Unfortunately, it is not in a good location for visiting the major sites. There is nothing much to see close by, and it is a good 10 minute walk to the Metro station. We like to stay near the center of historic sites so we can come back to the hotel to rest and freshen up. Nest trip we will try for a hotel closer to Las Ramblas or one of the major squares. We were warned by other tourists, though, that some of the older hotels near Las Ramblas don't have cold air conditioning, so check that out before making summer reservations.", "Date": "July 16, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Catalonia La Pedrera", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d228553-Reviews-Catalonia_La_Pedrera-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$135 - $241*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ Corcega 368</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08037</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> (Formerly Catalonia Corcega Hotel)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "228553", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cf/55/f0/entrada-catalonia-la.jpg"}}
