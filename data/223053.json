Bait and Switch Tactics..BEWARE!!\u201d", "Author": "tinkerbtch", "ReviewID": "UR125478388", "Content": "Staff at the front desk told me the night before that I would be getting a suite. When I asked to see the room or a similar room to what I would be in, the counter help quickly made up excuses saying that all the rooms were different and they couldn't guarantee which room I would get but that I WOULD get a suite. I told her that I understood but I would like to see one to get an idea of the property. At that point she told me she was the only person at the desk and she could not show me. I guess I should have known something was up right then. She avoided showing me a room like the plague. The next day I called for hotel information and a man answered the phone, he sneered at the suggestion that I would be getting a studio room through priceline. I explained that I had talked to a lady at the desk who had assured me that was what I was getting (i only booked it because it stated in the description \"suite\"). Once again he looks at me like I'm an idiot and assures me that I'm not getting a suite. With that said, The hotel lobby is pretty and slightly but not overly impressive. Chandeliers, book case, business center with only one pc that is continually occupied being capable of going on the internet. We are given a room key and told we would be staying on the 4th floor in a king bed room two beds were not available). We got on the elevator (which is entirely too small), but effective I guess..just really slow. As we walked down the hallways it had a weird burning tire smell to it, but I shrugged it off. We reached the door, opened it and immediately realized the room was soooo small! Terribly small. It was moderately nice...just way too small. The bathroom door was wroken and so was the toilet seat. There was water damage on the bathroom walls and ceiling. I called down to the front desk and asked two questions about the hotel, I was cut off mid sentence (was only allowed time to ask part of what I needed to know), They sounded annoyed that I had the nerve to bother them. I assumed they were busy, and just called back later. I got the same rude/short response and cut off. I went down to the lobby to ask the question when they weren't so busy. The two ladies at the desk refused to even look up when I spoke to them. They gave very short answers..just plain rude rude rude.. I've seen some reviews saying they had good service and I'm thinking they must have been employees because there is no way at all that the counter people could be considered helpful. I passed the workout room on the way back up to my room, I decided to take a look. I opened the door and was almost knocked to the floor from the disgusting odor of it. We also later ate at the cafe on the first floor, the hamburgers were not fully cooked..I gagged ..it was that raw in the middle. The fries were good. The drinks were tiny, but they did refill them as needed. The burger had a good smoked flavor if you could get past the raw middle. Overall I would NOT recommend this hotel unless they fire everyone on the front desk and start over with employees who realize they are in the \"HOSPITALITY\" industry. I'm still shaking my head at how rude the front desk people were. I was severely disappointed. If that wasn't bad enough, housekeeping comes through slamming every door on the floor over and over until you walk outside to see what is going on, and they stare you down for opening the door and looking..instead of realizing maybe they should keep it down. I would stay here only if you are desperate..don't expect hospitality or service..expect rude people, a decent room (but nothing to write home about)..", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas, United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay & Service\u201d", "Author": "Crystal H", "ReviewID": "UR124554940", "Content": "the service was great and the staff was very nice and courteous.

Okay, basically, I'm giving thumbs up save for one thing. I'm thinking to save on building costs, the building provides rooms with precast concrete slab floors that also serve as the ceiling, making the already relatively small rooms seem even smaller.

We got a really cheap deal (should have been a clue). Said the regular rate was $79/night, and we got it for $50. When we first checked in, they put us in a room on the 2nd floor. As we got off the elevator on that floor, the smell was almost enough to make me sick. It smelled like stale chicken noodle soup. I'm not sure if it was actually someone's food on that floor, or if it always smelled like that. When we got to our room, the bed was half made. There was a pile of linens on the floor with a note saying \"no touch\". There was a half drank Sprite sitting on the desk, and several pieces of trash (ie. receipts, papers). We went down to the front desk, and after calling housekeeping, they said, \"oh, that room is already occupied.\" NICE! They then put us in another room (right next door to the original one). It was in order when we walked in, but upon further inspection, there were hairs all over. The bed had at least 3 dark black hairs mingled in with the sheets. It appeared there was a pubic hair on the A/C unit, and a long black hair on the bathtub. I refused to even use the tub the next morning for a shower, as it appeared not particularly clean itself. It's apparent that this is an older hotel. They have tried to put a new coat of paint on things, and maybe hang some newer picutres in the rooms, etc. but it's very evident that furniture, carpets, bath fixtures, etc are old. My husband attempted to pick up the room phone to call the front desk that night, but the phone didn't work. He then walked over to the OTHER phone, and it did not work either!! We were looking online at other hotels in the area, seriously considering leaving that night, but I'm very pregnant and was exhausted by the time this day was over. So, I decided to sleep wrapped up in the blanket I brought from home (since I knew it was actually clean) and use my own pillow. My husband wrapped his hotel pillow in an extra shirt he had. Then, to top things off, when we got home, I checked our bank account online. We had a $50 charge from the hotel! When I called I spoke with George. He explained that they put a hold on your card for 5-7 days. He said someone should have told you that when you checked in. The funny thing is, HE WAS THE ONE THAT CHECKED US IN!! At check-in he explained that the card would not be charged at all, only for \"incidentals\". The only decent thing I can say about this stay (other than it's over now), is that the breakfast was halfway decent. Things appeared to be fresh and clean. They give you vouchers when you check in for the breakfast buffet. You walk in and nobody checks anything. You just go through the line and get your food, then sit down. Anyone could walk in off the street and have breakfast there evidentally. Bottom line is....we typically stay at nicer hotels (Doubletree, Marriott), but decided to take a chance on a good deal with good reviews. I'm not sure where the other people that reviewed this hotel stayed, or what they're used to, but don't waste your $$!

I checked out the BW Conference Center because it had good reviews and the cost for one night stay was only $52. I was skeptical at first but my husband and I figured it was only for one night and they did have good reviews. Well I will just say you get what you pay for. The hotel itself does not look bad it's just that because maybe the rates are so low it attracts another \"element\" of clientele. When we went to check in the woman at the desk told us we would have to wait because check in was not until an hour or so, as we went to have a seat in the lobby area I noticed they had a conference event going on, this motel must be known for that because the conference goers seemed to be very happy. but then I noticed a woman who was sitting near us having a phone converstaion telling someone to meet her at the hotel, she looked like she was high on something and her heels where even higher she then started talking loudly cursing into the phone and said she will just meet them across the street. When we went over to the desk there was another young woman who was in front of me and she was telling the clerk she needed to get back into the room because she left her shoes in the room she had no luggage and was dressed \"sparingly\" she looked like she was high and antsy. At this point I was concerned about the rooms and when I talked to the clerk I asked her about the clientele she acted like she did not know what I was talking about and she reassured me that this was a very nice hotel and that we would enjoy our stay she asked if I would like to upgrade to a suite for $30 more I said yes thinking that maybe the suites were more nicer than a regular room. We walked into the\"suite\" and it had a faint stale smell and the furniture was old and dark my husband refused and said it looks like the \"party\" room so we went back and got a regular room which was actually alot better it was clean even though it was small for a one night layover it was fine. This motel looks like it was a older motel before and it was spruced up low ceilings in the hallways, dark and very tiny elevators.

The location was very convenient, and the price (less than $60 per night) was low enough to make me consider maybe looking for a different hotel. Since I was traveling alone, I decided to go ahead and book a room. I AM SO GLAD I DID!!! The location ended up being perfect for everything I had to do while in Dallas. However, this was secondary to the hotel itself. I arrived late (11:30 p.m.) the employees behind the counter were very friendly and mannerly. I was still skeptical as to what I would find behind the door to my room. When I got to my room, I was more than pleasantly surprised! First the room was clean and fresh. Very nicely appointed! There was a king sized bed, wing chair, desk with chair, refridgerator, microwave, television and a dresser. I have stayed at much more expensive hotels and not been near as impressed as I was with this Best Western. Now, the rooms are not giant sized rooms, so if you need huge rooms you should go pay lots more for a different hotel.

As was the food - both breakfast and dinner. Delicious and plentiful. The serving staff were helpful (gave us directions to local points of interest) were friendly, and very pleasant to deal with. The front desk staff (I beleive) are not trained properly. We asked them for directions and they could not help us. Didn't even try, or make suggestions. I think they were overwhelmed and too busy to process thoughts. And now the bad stuff.... Cleanliness wasn't the best. We stayed for a week and the bathroom floor was not swept once during that time. Mold (small spot) growing on the bathtub grout. This was not significant enough that we would change hotels for though. The bad stuff happened upon checkout. We reserved for a 7 night stay last fall, and were quoted an excellent rate. That is why we chose this hotel. When we checked in, the gal at the front desk tried to give us a significantly higher rate. We showed her our e-mail from the hotel, stating the rates. She said she would make the change. We watched the weather channel on TV everyday, and saw that there was a storm moving into the midwestern states. Becasue we were driving back to Canada, we decided that we would try to beat the storm system and leave 2 nights early. We informed the front desk 48 hours in advance of our leaving. When we went to check out, we saw that our Credit cards had already been charged, and at a higher rate than we were quoted - and again, a different rate from the one quoted to us a check in time. We again pointing out the significantly lower rate that we were quoted via e-mail last fall. The staff did not know what to do and called the manager. He refused to honour the rate quoted because we were leaving early! So what's the point of having a rate quoted at all? Obviously, once they have your credit card, they can put through whatever rate they feel like. We explained again, that we had the rate confirmed and he again, told us that he did not have to honour that as we chose to leave early. I was VERY upset. I told him, and I'll tell you, that I have stayed at hotels (some Best Westerns) all over North America and I have NEVER experienced this before! I told him that I believed what he was doing was criminal, and I believe it is. This is just wrong, wrong, wrong. SO beware fellow travellers. And check your credit card statement!

It was a bit small from what I expected at other Wyndham Hotels in the past. I am a Wyndham By Request member myself and my small bottle of wine and cookies were there on the desk. I stayed for one night checking in on December 19th, 2007. The bathroom had an older style pedestal sink but it was in good repair. They have nice shelves installed to make up for the lack of counter-top space. The bathtub was clean but not properly level as a low spot collected water and did not drain completely after my shower. I have included photos of the room that I stayed in. I hope this helps with other people thinking of staying at this hotel. I ate in the bar as the restaurant was closed in the week leading up to Christmas. I had Fettucine Alfredo with Chicken and it was good. The Tomato Basil soup was only warm, not hot but the service was fine. I was the only patron eating at the time. The hotel is in a built up part of Dallas quite close to the Texas Instruments business park at the intersection of Texas 75 and I-635. I stayed on the 6th floor in a non-smoking room. This is the top floor for this hotel. The room was clean and reasonably well appointed. It may very well be that this room was updated in the recent past. The pillows in the bed were acceptable but not spectacular. The high speed internet connection was a wired connection and it was free for me (perhaps because I am a Wyndham By Request member) and quite fast. I did not watch TV and so cannot comment on the channel selection. When checking out, I picked up a USA Today and a Wall Street Journal, both provided to guests for free down in the lobby.
