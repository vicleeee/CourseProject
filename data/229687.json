There are many good things to say about this hotel and if all stars align you might have a very enjoyable stay in this wonderful city, but I just happened to hit the low notes, which makes me never want to come back to this place. The good things: 1. beautiful lobby and hallway designs, really well done cross-over of modern and classical accents. 2. in pinciple beautifully modern designed and well functioning guest rooms as far as the bare room design and fixtures go. 3. rich breakfast menu. The not so good things: 1. small dungeon pool in the dark basement with terrible service (off note there is a pool picture in their prospectus - no idea were that was taken but hardly in that pothole). 2. ill-ventilated tiny gym with juck-dirty barely functioning equipment. There are up to four people hanging out around the gym who seam like hotel staff but none is doing anything but chatting. Not even spray and paper to clean off the layers of rotting sweat on the treadmill. Since the equipment looked like that, I didn't even dare to go into the hot-tub or pool. The gym is hot, has no airflow / ventilator, and the ceiling is very low. If you are 190 / 6'5'' - don't even think about getting on the treadmill. 3. there are three 8 person elevators of which one didn't work a considerable period. The eights person brings luggage and the elevator stops = eight Standard Europeans without luggage = 75kg basta => plan at least 10 minutes for one trip up or down during \"rush hour\". 4. The breakfast room had 2 service staff - good luck getting that coffee. 5. the room windows don't close appropriately and whine all night if there is wind; naturally they are also pretty useless as noise insulators. 6. Most aggravating: guest rooms on level 2 and 4 are to be considered asylums for the hearing impaired. If your ear is doing what it's supposed to do, the staff will keep you up all night, guaranteed. There are meeting rooms on level 1 and 3 and chairs, tables, any kind of equipment are per strictest rules only moved during night time. Now, what's important to consider here is that we are taking stone/marble floors and steel frame tables and chairs which are by default moved not by lifting them up and carrying them but by dragging them under the maximum noise development possible from one room to the next. 7. staff behaved dishonest to me: at check in I was told that my room was facing the street but quiet; when I hadn't yet figured out that the commotion was coming from the conference levels the hotel representative responding to my desperate call wanted to make me believe that it was just the occasional street traffic noise; when I went downstairs where the tables and chairs were thrown around I was told that they apologized but that they were done now (that was until I left) by the time I reached my room they were already back in full swing; when I came to the front desk to change rooms the next day, which was arranged by our meeting organizer, I was told that the hotel was sold out and that I had to stay where I was; when being assertive, suddenly a room opened up and happened to be clean, facing to the quieter side of the hotel and on a higher floor, several flights up from the conference area. 8. The meeting break service was dreadful. The coffee never drinkable, the hot water always cold, the sodas always warm.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGREAT VALUE FOR MONEY\u201d", "Author": "goingnowhere87", "ReviewID": "UR128152339", "Content": "The rooms are big and comfortable with nice amenities, I only had the chance to stay one night and left very early in the morning so couldn't take advantage of the hotel but in general the staff was friendly the location is very good, with the subway station just across the street, 15 min walk to Paseo del Prado and 5 min walk to Plaza del Sol so the location could not be better.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hull", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay in one of the rooms on the lower floors if you want a good nights sleep!!\u201d", "Author": "KTaylor55", "ReviewID": "UR127555571", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel Easter weekend for a one night stay following a trip to Salamanaca.

The desk clerk (wish I'd gotten his name!) was kind enough to stow my bags, direct me to the best breakfast buffet outside of the old MGM Grand in Reno and quickly make up a room for me that was vacated by an American airline crew. The room was spacious and clean and the view from the 11th floor was amazing. I read previous reviews and saw the comments about the funky lights and lack of customer service. The lights were weird but tolerable and I saw no evidence of anything but 5 star customer service during my four days there. The food was very, very good and I reintroduced saturated fats into my diet in a big way (note to self - check cholesterol soon). The aforementioned breakfast is worth the money and try the caffe con leche for that fabulous caramel jolt until anywhere else. I got a kick out of the very young bartender who made me a \"perfect martini\" which consisted solely of vodka and crushed ice, with a side of Gummi bears. Not that I'm complaining....

One year later and things have not changed much. I found customer service to be better than last time, the girl at reception was nice and her colleague who provided me with a map the following day was also very helpful. No complaints on this regard, which was actually the major flaw I found last year. I also tried the restaurant this time and the food (a mixture of western and asian styles) was pretty good, with big portions and, as expected, a big price too. This was not a problem, though, as we had a discount coupon for 40 euros which we promptly used with the lunch, so it actually ended up being a bargain! The problem was, again, in the very nice but not that functional room. And there's not much that can be done about it... The hotel was refurbished in 2008 and it's pretty obvious they won't do it again in some time, so it is what it is: I'll say it again, the room is really nice and modern, the bed huge and comfy... but the light switches are very confusing (I lost count of how many times I unintentionally turned the bathroom's lights out while my wife was in there, and also woke her up a couple of times when I switched the wrong one in the middle of the night...) and washing one's hands require more flexibility in the wrists than I actually have at my age. If you can overlook this, and the fact that there was some visible mould in quite a few parts of the bathtub (no big deal for me... It appeared in my bathtub at home too and I know how bloody hard it is to remove, if at all), it is still a very good hotel, with a great breakfast and in a fine location.

I chose this hotel for its unbeatable central location - a mere ten-minute-walk to Plaza de Espana and Gran Via. Metro station \"Ventura Rodriguez\" is directly under the hotel while both stations \"Arguelles\" and \"Plaza de Espana\" are very close nearby. Booked my stay on Melia own website - booking process quick and easy, I opted for a Premium room at 145EUR excluding breakfast. Check-in quite satisfying - the receptionist on duty was welcoming and friendly. Premium room on the 2nd floor - I found it modern and quiet enough. Many amenities were available: individual air-conditioning, large desk, quite comfortable King-size bed. Other goodies included a comprehensive media equipment (flatscreen TV, DVD/CD player, USB ports), design sofa, coffee-making facilities. All equipment were working properly. The bathroom layout is very strange as it is split in two rooms: the first one includes two sinks but also the closets (!), while WC and bath are located in the second room! Bath and WC spotlessly clean and with many amenities including dental and shaving kits. On the downside the Melia website is quite misleading as it advertises \"very bright rooms, all with views over the city\" for Premium rooms. It was definitely NOT the case as my room looked over some emergency stairs and a narrow side street - very disappointing. Breakfast buffet was a bit expensive, therefore I preferred to eat outside. Efficient room service at very reasonable prices - I ordered some tapas for dinner (Iberian croquettes, bacalao fritters) which were quite tasty. The end of my stay was unfortunately let down by a very ILL-MANNERED maid service. I had asked for and been granted a late check-out until 15:00. I returned to my room at 13:30. Despite the \"Do not disturb\" sign, I found that half of the room had already been cleaned up! There were already new towels and soaps in the bathroom; on the opposite bed sheets had been stripped out but were still laying on the floor. More disturbingly I missed some of my toiletries and Madrid city maps that I wanted to keep. Fortunately I had put my cash and travel documents in the locked safe - what if I had not?! I complained about that during the check-out process. But the receptionist just smiled and shrugged away. I guess this might be a common occurence. However, as I am willing to pay extra for a Premium room, I also expect to be treated accordingly. This poor late check-out experience cast a shadow on an overall good stay in Madrid. All in all I can recommend this hotel for its unbeatable central location.

My wife and I booked this hotel for 8 nights through an agent and pre-paid on arrival to secure the best rate. We left at 1am in the morning after staying just 3 nights. We are both seasoned travellers and we have NEVER left a hotel before during the middle of our stay. In the interests of a balanced review I will outline the GOOD points of this hotel. The buffet breakfast was excellent in terms of quality and variety. The beds we had were comfortable and the room was acceptably clean. The location of the hotel was very convenient. Now I will explain the BAD points. Firstly on arrival they did not have me listed on the booking which was a minor problem. Then they made a mistake on the charges which needed correcting - this was just a little annoying. When we tried to use the room safe we found it did not work so went to Reception who without checking assured us it did work but I was not using it properly. Eventually they sent a technician to our room who found that the batteries in the safe door needed replacing which is why it would not close. The safe worked for 1 day before failing to close and again the technician had to be called. Initially Reception insisted we wait in the room for the technician until I explained that the safe was empty and open at which point they relented and it was fixed. The next issue was that both the bedside lights did not work. Again we had to ask for the technician to come to fix them. As far as the room goes it was quite small and cluttered for two people for 8 days (I estimate about 200 square feet including bath and toilet) and it was badly designed with so many light switches that I was treated to a disco sensation every time my wife used the bathroom. Also they managed to squeeze in a desk and reclining chair which would have been good IF the room had been larger. The room had been refurbished within the last 2 or 3 years in my estimation but it was not done to a great standard and there was missing grout and some mould in the bathroom. Room facilites were limited. There was no kettle or even an alarm clock or a radio though there was a TV. There were 2 particularly annoying features. The internal soundproofing was awful so we could hear lots of noise from the rooms above and next to us especially the scraping of furniture as the floors were wooden. In addition we were 2 rooms away from the lift and when you were in bed you could clearly hear the lift bell at night. The other annoying feature was the fire detector / alarm which was located right above the bed and flashed brightly every 3 seconds. Luckily we always carry earplugs and eye masks so we could cope with these 2 issues. Also towels and toiletaries were not replaced 100 percent as they should have been. We picked this hotel for the pool. When we went to use it we were told it would cost Euro 15 for each of us per day. According to our travel agent the website does not tell you of this extra charge and I am told the hotel verbally admitted this but would not relent and allow us to use the facilities for free - although at the end they offered my wife one free day to use the pool facilities. All of the above is not good for a \u00b4\u00b45 star\u00b4\u00a8 hotel but that is NOT why we left. On the fourth night we came back to our room at about 11pm and wanted a bath. The hot water ran brown (the cold seemed to be clear). It was not only brown but has scum on top and bits of detritus in. We called Reception who said let the bath run for a short time and it will go clear. We let it run for maybe 10 - 15 minutes and it was still brown so Reception sent up a technician who confirmed it was still brown! We asked Reception what the problem was. They came up with various answers such as it is a broken pipe outside and all the hotels in the area are affected (but if so why was the cold water running clear) but it became apparant that they just did not know. I asked if it was safe to use and they said absolutely it was. I then asked how could they say that it was safe if they did not know why it was happening. I also asked why they were not informing the guests and issuing bottled water - I was not given any answer to these 2 questions. We then asked to speak to the Duty Manager - AND WERE TOLD THAT THIS \u00a8\u00a85 STAR\u00a8\u00a8 200+ BEDROOM HOTEL DOES NOT HAVE A MANGER AT NIGHT EVER!! (and this is standard in Spain!) and so the only person to deal with was the 23 year old (my guess) part-time student receptionist. The Manager (Fatima?) was at home and we awaited a call from her which never came. Eventually at midnight we asked for a refund for the 5 nights we had not used and we were told we had to wait until the Manager arrived in the morning. I said that the hotel now ought to call the police in to mediate as I was so unhappy and funnily enough within 2 or 3 minutes we had a refund and were able to leave!! I will try and tell Melia about this review and see what they have to say but we are now in a centrally located 5 star hotel paying about Euro 5 LESS a night with access to the business lounge and a 600 sq foot room. The other issue we found is that the staff we spoke to on Reception apart from 2 young girls spoke very little English - which is not what you expect for a so called \u00a8\u00a85 Star\u00a8\u00a8 hotel. They also had a really bad attitude apart from one tall slim blonde girl who spoke good English and was really helpful - but she was not there when we left.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cI'll be back !\u201d", "Author": "therudies86", "ReviewID": "UR120750456", "Content": "I've stayed in many hotels, but this one takes the cake in terms of thoughtful touches.

I am glad that those who have contributed positive reviews enjoyed this facility. Alas it was not for me. By no stretch of the imagination can it be classified as 5 star. It has serious failings at many levels from poor service at front of house to room design flaws that made for an unpleasent few days. There are 2 types of room on the second floor of this hotel advertised and allocated as \"PREMIUM\" guests rooms. The first (a corner type room) in which I spent 3 nights was absolutely awful. It was cramped and uncomfortable. The room I stayed in (201) had serious design flaws. More later,but a word of genuine advice, if you do decide to stay here do not accept a corner room on this level. The second room on the same level which they allocated to me for the last night was far more acceptable. Had I been given this room at the beginning the review might be different however it was only on the last day after speaking to guests relations (excellent lady) did they accept that my concerns regarding both room and service and willingly changed rooms for me.. The first room was tacky and flawed in many ways. The wardrobe space was a joke and the lights within it kept coming on and off through the night. Whoever choose the sink units had an eye for optics as opposed to practicality and function. You cannot put both hands under the tap unless of course you are a small child. The whole bathroom design in my opinion was nickle and dime,looks in fact good but wont last. Which of course brings me to the issue of service or non service. On the first morning the shower never worked. I reported same. When I came back I still could not operate it. Was told the maintenence left a note. The whole service approach to the issue was of a poor standard. Not even in a youth hostel as a young man did I ever need a note to tell me how to operate a shower. In this corner type room there is no proper light over the bath/shower and you would need the vision of superman to distinguish between gel/shampoo/conditioner. If you want to read in bed forget it unless you bring your own torch. Again optics over function occupies the bed space. The lighting looks nice but you cant read.. To use the safe you have to get on your hands and knees to the bottom of the bedside locker were there is no light. However if you bring your torch, magnifying glass and knee pads you might just about manage it..Perhaps some might find this a little over the top. It is my honest experience. I spend approximately 70/80 nights a year away from home and usually in 5 star hotels. This is no 5 star hotel and is not the best of advertisements for standards that might apply across the Melia product. In a word. AWFUL So, what was good.. The bed was most comfortable,both rooms nicely serviced and cleaned, bathroom amenities plentiful and of a good quality. The location for seeing Madrid itself was also a plus and the Melia was within easy walking distance to some excellent restaurants on the Grand Via Plaza de Mayor and Sol districts. The metro is less than 2 minutes walk away. Would I return??

Let's start with positive sides. Location is great close to major attractions and only steps away from Metro, which gives you easy access to everywhere in Madrid. It is also one of the very hotel in town that offers possibility of family rooms ( we travelled with 2 kids - 4 and 12 years old). I spent hours trying to find a family friendly room in Madrid for a reasonable price, but ended up with only choices offering 2 connecting rooms. Melia Princessa offers excellent family rooms with 2 additional beds , which is not common in this city! We also got excited about swimming pool and spa , as I knew i will have to work which gave family extra incentive to choose this place, however it turned out not to be so great. Pool is too deep for kids and too small for adults, spa is very small and as someone before pointed out lockers smells like a public bathrooms. Spa/pool staff is very unfriendly and shouts on kids when they talk too loud or you disturb them in they never-ending siesta while asking for towels. It was a disappointment. When it comes to room we decided to choose the Level experience. For some affordable extra $ - if you can afford it's very recommended as it gives you access to private lounge and services. Family room we stayed was very specious ( some 40 m2) and modern furbished. Comfortable king bed and smaller beds for kids. Bathroom with separate shower and bath/spa and even bidet. We tried in-room spa one day, but it takes forever to fill it up so we never used it since. Major disappointment comes regarding room service. Amenities were not refilled regularly, bin was not emptied , etc. We complained , but not much change in fact we observed more rude behaviour from room service, like giving us 20 bottles of bath gel, but not refilling water, etc. Hotel offers free WiFi service, but it does not work well in all rooms and is annoying as requires new code after 24 hours. There is a business centre in The Level lounge where you can use free access to internet and printer. The lounge offers limited snacks and drinks or a small breakfast during the week. I have not had a chance to try it during the week , but Sunday breakfast offered in main hall was amazing and one of the best parts of overall experience.

The decorations is sublime, the rooms are white and Red and you have the choice to choose the color of preference for your night table. From orange to green from pink to blue. You make the choice.

As I have one of their MaS cards, I usually receive offers and email alerts, and this time the opportunity was too good to let it go: two nights for the price of one, bed and breakfast. I chose the Melia Princesa out of convenience, actually, since it was relatively close to the concert venue. Of course, it being a 5 stars hotel was also taken into account... The offer did not give us opportunity to choose the kind of room we wanted, so we had to settle for a standard. It was quite all right, though: big enough, modern furniture (with form over function at times, though: see the review where the guest complained about the shape of the faucets, spot on!!), king bed, nice and spacious bathroom with bathtub and shower... I think we were upgraded to one of the rooms on the top floors, since standard rooms don't often come with a view in the Melia chain, and ours had a nice one. Another advantage of the MaS card! Buffet Breakfast was included in the price and was excellent, as is usually the trend with this chain. Of course, this time it was up to the hotel\u2019s standard: fresh orange juice, ready made eggs, ready made pancakes... lots of meats (cold and hot) to choose from, smoked cod, smoked salmon, lots of fruits and such a wide range of food in general I didn't know where to start! However, not everything was as good. I tend to rate hotels in TA according to my level of satisfaction, but also taking into account the category of the hotel. I had a just as good experience in the 3-stars hotel I stayed in when in Valencia, and a better one in the 4-stars hotel in Seville. In Melia Princesa, the room was clean but the walls were worn out, stained and chipped in some places; there was only one bathrobe and a pair of slippers in the room, even though they knew well in advance that we were two people; My mobile phone run out of power and they couldn\u2019t provide me with a common and simple Nokia charger... while in the 3-stars hotel in Valencia they had a counter in the hall with several kinds of chargers for every brand. Customer service was cold at best: 5 stars should mean something more than just having a bellman to take your luggage to your room, I can do that myself, but I expect a kinder welcome in general. Smiling doesn\u2019t hurt! This doesn't apply to the staff in the restaurant, however, who were all very nice and polite at all times. The pros beat the cons anyway, and we had a pleasant stay as the bed was very comfy and, as I said, breakfast was excellent and the rates unbeatable.

The location was perfect (at least for us). We were able to take the metro (2 euro per person) to the hotel in about 30 or so minutes. We took the pink line to the blue line to the yellow line. Sounds complicated but was really easy. Ventura Rodriguez is the stop right outside the hotel which made it so easy to get around town. Plaza De Espana is a short walk from the hotel (roughly 10 minutes) and Temple Debod is about a 15 minute walk. We stayed on the 12th floor and had a lovely view with the Palacio Real in view. It only took us about 20 minutes to walk to the Palacio Real but you could tube it if you wanted (Opera is the stop you'd need). Also, if you decide to take the Madrid Vision hop on/off tour, the bus lets you off really close to the hotel. If you walk toward Plaza De Espana, you will come across several restaurants from cheap (Burger King) to more expensive. We ate at Cafe & Te' which is sort of cheap to mid range. I really liked the hotel and location. The room is modern and nice. There are doors inside the room that you can close to keep out hallway noise. The hotel corridor lights come on when you enter it which was a nice green touch, otherwise they were really dim. The shower was lovely with a big shower head and also a hand held one that was great for washing hair. The bell hop showed us how to use the room and helped us with our luggage. The front desk was helpful and showed us where the hotel was on a map and then pointed out a couple of major sights.

I echo a few sentiments that were expressed in previous reviews about this hotel. It was so average and low-key, there really isn't much to write about and I'm usually one to write quite extensive reviews. On the other hand, there isn't anything that requires major complaining either. Basically, this is your run-of-the-mill city centre hotel with average facilities, an average (overpriced) breakfast, average staff and an average room. That being said, they were obviously positive and negative. To get it out of the way, I'll start with the negative/neutral aspects so you're not left reading this thinking it's all about complaints and no substance. First and foremost, the location is average. Not quite in the middle of everything yet, not quite far enough that you would require riding the subway all the time to see the major sights of Madrid. If you're looking for a city centre location that's a little more quiet than say, a hotel situated a few minutes from the Prado or the Atocha Station area, this hotel represents a good choice amongst Madrid hotels. You're never more than a 10-minute walk from restaurants and some of the attractions, or worst case, a 10-minute metro ride, of which you will find a station literally within 100 steps of the hotel's entrance. Secondly, for a hotel that pretends to be 5-star and is rated as such, it doesn't deliver 5-star service or facilities. This would be a 4-star hotel at best in most western countries. The hotel doesn't have a concierge and the front desk suggestions were often off, especially for restaurants. After 2 questionnable dining reccomendations the first 2 nights, we simply relied on our guidebook on the 3rd night. The rooms were indeed renovated quite recently but I question the functionality and the quality of guest room furnishings. Laminate flooring, Laminated faux wood furniture, Plastic faux glass everywhere, it was very IKEA-esque (even felt a little cheaper) and certainly didn't feel like staying in a 5-star hotel. The advertised pillow menu on the hotel's website was nowhere to be seen. In addition, the so-called DreamMax bed by Melia is really nothing to write home about. After lying down the first time, I wondered if the hotel had just put the fancy sheets and pillows on top of an old mattress. Check done, it was indeed a brand new mattress but forget the \"pillowtop\" Melia advertises on its website, this was nowhere near as plush as Westin's heavenly bed, the Marriott Revive beds, etc. Perhaps it is better suited for Spanish clientele, because it had little padding, was stiff )and not in a good way) and in no way particularly comfy. The duver provided is not the soft, warm feather type you'll find in those other chains either, it is filled with synthetic fabric. No interactive TV (not that it mattered to us but it sure is expected in any so called 5-star hotel in the world). Limited toiletries (they only provide on bar soap, shampoo and body wash. Do not expect to find conditioner or body lotion here, there is none. Melia has a lot to learn from the other major international chain on that. I do not recall seeing an iron or board. That being said, the hotel was also applying its substandard facilities to the minibar pricing, I though 2 euros for bottled water was quite reasonable for a hotel and phone calls were not a rip-off which can often be the case in Europe. Thirdly, the breakfast, charged at 26 Euros per person, was absolutely nowhere near worth that much. Limited hot selection which granted, is not common in Europe but at such a price, should have been provided for overseas visitors. Breakfast room staff could not crack a smile and they finally came to serve coffee while we were about to leave. Either they were understaffed but it felt like the two employees there that morning just lacked motivation. Finally for the negatives, the pool area hours were limited. During the month of August, the facility is simply closed on week-ends. In a seasonal hotel, ok maybe, but in the middle of the tourist season in Madrid, that's just cheap. The fact that they charge is also a bit ridiculous. Now, for the good parts. The hotel's cleanliness was examplary. A lot of North American properties could learn a lesson from these guys. The A/C kept the room well cooled in the midst of +40 celcius temperatures in Madrid. The shower was one of those nice \"rainshower\" type. The bellman was always on the ball to help you and most opened the door for you which gave it a touch of class. The internet access, just by the reception desk, is decently priced at 4 Euros per 30 minute period. The lobby and lounge area were quite attractively decorated and felt quite a bit more luxurious than the rooms. Note that the staff, even though they weren't quite on the spot with their recommendations, were prompt to respond to service request, such as when I called for a feather pillow. Housekeeping is good at respecting the do not disturb sign, even when we slept late (until nearly noon). However, on a funny side, I took away the DND sign one morning so the maid would be aware that we wanted cleaning and 2 minutes later, she entered without knocking and yelled at us for taking it off while not being ready to leave. I don't know if I should call this efficiency or being just plain rude but we laughed it off. The LCD TV had a good selection of international channels in Spanish, German, French and English. Overall, this was good value given the rate we paid (pre-paid on Sol Melia's website) but given the reputation of the chain, it was a little underwhelming. A lot of the facilities were closed during our stay and the staff, although efficient, wasn't overly friendly or helpful. That being said, they weren't rude either. The rooms felt cheap and they are small, although if you didn't know that rooms, even in major hotels, are small in European city centres, and you complain about it, you're probably better staying in North America. Note that rooms with 2 beds are always 2 single beds pushed together. I'd say, go for it if you think you're getting good value (100 Euros or less?) but don't expect a glamourous hotel with white glove service. It's a run-of-the-mill, city centre business hotel, nothing more, nothing less.

We got the metro from the airport to the hotel - alighting the train at sol (though we found out on the walk to the hotel that Rodriguez station was practically outside the hotel!) & could see the hotel from here as its quite tall. Word of warning to anyone that decides to take the metro & walk to the hotel; the hotel is along the road, but the entrance down a side turning.... not an issue for safety or anything but we actually walk passed it because we were expecting the entrance along the roadside! The building itself, from the outside, is quite dated - but then it's pretty hard to change that once its built. Reception is lovely & very trendy - all red and black with large glass chandeliers, leather couches, thick pile rugs and single lily's. Check in was a breeze and the reception was staff were really friendly & helpful. We were given top floor (12) and room 1224!!

Bar area really sumptuous & toilets very clean, breakfast area is also very nice - though we didn\u2019t actually eat at the hotel. Hallways to the rooms were pretty trendy too - carried on the red, black & white theme with marble art deco statues and the lighting was censored. Walkways were lit at ground level and when you walked into the hallway overhead lights came on- slightly dimmed to avoid that awful brightness you can get. Really nice ambience. I adored the room!!! Some people I notice have complained that the lighting was ait gadgety and it was - but I thought it was fun. I liked the lighting either side of the bed that changed colour and could be set at whichever you preferred, I like the massive flat screen telly on the wall and the glass tables and the large screen prints instead of stuffy mass produced paintings, & that all the lights could be controlled from the bed. The bed was large & massively comfortable with a menu of different pillows should you not like the 6 that were already supplied. Bathroom was great too - the usual complimentary toiletries were supplied (shampoo, shower gel, soap, toothpaste & brush, shoe shine) and plenty of towels. Dual sinks were a nice bonus and I loved the shower which had one of those heads that are as large as a plate and makes it feel like rain. Also had a separate shower head for washing hair over the bath which was handy too. Bath and toilet are separated from the sink area by a frosted glass door & there is a switch on the wall which pipes the tv into speakers there so you can catch the news or listen to music in the bath/shower. Enough storage space - the main hanging area splits the small corridor to the room and the bathroom, with doors on both sides so that clothes can be reached from either in the bathroom or the corridor (the whole wall of the corridor is a mirror). The rail is a light also which illuminates on a sensor also. Wi-fi connection available and free safety deposit box in the room. (which is big enough to put a netbook in - I had this query myself before I went) plenty of plug sockets, in areas I actually need them.... like near a mirror! There is a club about 2mins walk but I never heard any noise from it or outside at all.

Room size (standard room) is reasonable, but could be larger for a 5 star hotel. Wall papers were dirty and ugly. Walls and furniture were green and blue. Breakfast buffet is very good, also the bf room is nice. Sol Melia MAS card holder gets a free bf for a companion which is very good benefit. 10\u20ac for excellent bf is good value. Service in reception is very good and professional, some Spanish words help a lot. Also doormen are very polite and helpful. Location is quite OK for visits to the Royal Palace and Plaza Mayor, but I prefer the other part of the Old City where the main museums and Retiro Park are. Calle Princesa (street) is not as noisy as Gran Via. Last time I lived there and will never do that again. I got mixed feelings about this hotel - room was at 2-3 star level, but everything else was fine. I am quite sure that the hotel will soon start a major renovation project. Before the renovation starts, the hotel could offer a free entrance to the pool and sauna (now 15\u20ac +tax 7%) to keep customers happy. Spanish hotel rating system needs some updating. Once a hotel has been awarded 5 stars in 1960's, seems that it will never be downgraded. I also spent recently three nights in Gran Hotel Canarias which is rated 4 GL.

The location of the hotel is great - about 2 blocks before Princesa turns into the famous Gran Via. You can walk to most of the popular tourist spots. I stayed at a different hotel (Hotel Emperador) for a few days after checking out of this one (for personal vacation purposes), and everyday I wished I were back at this one!

This trip, I insisted on the Princesa and I am glad I did. The staff were most friendly and helpful and the rooms are certainly bigger and better than the Galgos for the same price. Well equipped 4 piece bathroom and shower and most rooms have a decent view. Bar and restaurant are of the highest quality although I normally choose to eat out. There are numerous restaurants and bars nearby and their is a Metro station right outside which has been recently refurbished. Plaza de Espana and Arguelles stations are also within 2 or 3 minutes walk with connections to most parts of Madrid. The area itself is not too bad with the Plaza de Espana and Palacio Real minutes walk away and a spacious park next to the palace. I never feel threatened walking around at night as it's quite busy and most locals tend to come out around 11 at night. However, on my last morning, I fell victim to the old 'distraction robbery' nearby. I felt something splash on the back of my jacket and a stranger appeared to 'help' me clean my jacket. Meanwhile, his accomplice had run off with my briefcase. This was near Arguelles around 10:30am in broad daylight but when I got back to the Princesa to see if they could help, I was bowled over by their assistance. I explained what had happened and one of the staff took my jacket away and cleaned it up a treat while the general manager helped me report the incident. I was very grateful for their help and also grateful that I wasn't harmed as the manager said that this was a common occurence in the area and they usually pull a knife out! This is about the fifth time I have stayed here and it wouldn't put me off staying here again.

We were expecting a top class hotel, comparable to other Melias we have stayed in in Spain, but this was a big let down. Our first room, a standard double, was a shabby, gloomy affair on the top floor. We changed to a superior room which was a little better, supposedly modernised, just with a different colour scheme. Heavy outsize drapes and grubby net curtains, none of them hung properly with enough hooks, made opening the windows difficult. The sink sat outside the rest of the bathroom which had a swinging glass partition rather than a door. The general appearance of the room was faded with no attention to detail at all. The rooms are in long dark corridors which are stiflingly hot. On the plus side, the other public areas, including the restaurant are classy and breakfast excellent. The staff were friendly although reception seemed bemused that there might be any problem.

When I asked at the reception, they sent me back and told me somebody would come (they state everywhere \"Our commitment: 100% satisfaction in 15 minutes!). But nobody showed up even after 20 minutes. When I called the reception from my room, they said that there had been an emergency with the lady who opens the gym and that she had to go to the hospital... But why did they send me back to the gym and let me wait for 20 minutes if this happened already the night before? and why did they not put up a sign that the gym is closed?
