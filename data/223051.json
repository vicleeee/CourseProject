I expected this being a airport hotel, but just wanted to warn anybody else that had a night flight like me, do no expect any sleep outside of midnight to 6am. They fly that late and start that early. The bed was clean, I found check in to be very friendly. The Greek restaurant that is next door was very friendly but the food was not that good, and it was over priced. Check out was fast, but not very friendly. I had no issues with the shuttle picking me up at noon or driving me back at 9pm. Both drivers were friendly. Internet is free but very slow. The only thing I would note is if you don't have a cell phone, I found phoning the shuttle impossible. I read that there are phones located in the airport to call the hotel, but no one knew where, and someone working there called the hotel for me on their cell phone.

It seems, however, some use it more then others. We called for shuttle pick-up around 11:15 PM. Over an hour later (and two more calls) the shuttle arrived. During this wait we saw shuttles for other hotels go by numerous times. The shuttle for the Renaissance/Crown Plaza (mentioned later) went by at least three times. The next day, our over seas flight did not leave until late evening. When we checked out, we were informed that the last shuttle left at 12 noon because that was their check out time. The guy at the front desk suggested that we could (if we were not afraid) walk three blocks to the Renaissance and use theirs. They did allow us to store our luggage, so at 5:30 PM we hauled our luggage down to the Renaissance and stowed away on their shuttle. The internet to print a boarding pass was not free--$ 5 minimum.

We broke up the trip with an overnight in LA before embarking on the long flight. I was glad we stayed here, as this met all our needs. With AAA booking directly on their site is a great value. Had a room with two queen beds. Clean. The room was bigger than many we've stayed in - even had a couch, which was perfect for last minute Skype calls and re-arranging luggage. Internet worked really well and was free. Breakfast was standard Super 8, basic cereals and muffins with beverages. Seating area was open all the time as it's part of the check-in area. This was great for us, as I have food sensitivities. This allowed me to fix my own dinner/lunch with the microwave. The rest of the family ordered food from a restaurant that delivered, which was very convenient. We made use of their coin laundry. We enjoyed the courtyard/parking lot area which felt very safe and allowed our kids to run off some steam. At the airport, the station where you are supposed to be able to call the hotels for shuttle service was out of order (this is not the hotel's fault). We had Super 8's phone number, so we called with our cell phone. It should be noted that a phone call needs to be placed in order to get the shuttle service. We waited about 15 minutes after placing our call, and the shuttle had plenty of room for our massive amount of luggage. Returned to airport the next day by shuttle that left on the hour. The drivers were very helpful and friendly and helped us with all the bags. Shuttles are free + tip for driver's help with luggage. Only potential drawback is that if you are a sensitive sleeper, the planes are pretty loud. We were exhausted so it didn't bother us a bit. We couldn't hear anything from the neighboring rooms or outside, other than the planes. Perhaps ear plugs would do the trick. :) Also, at one time hot water ran out fairly quickly.

I was able to find a highly discounted rate on priceline for $52.00 per night, which was excellent considering it was a weekend. As the Super 8 is a value chain, of course one can't go there expecting the Ritz-Carlton! With that being said, the staff were great from start to finish, very nice people. Before even completing my request for a cab company number, they were on the phone calling for me. Great customer service! This location has a free shuttle service to and from LAX. They can be contacted at any of the courtesy phone touch-screen kiosks that are located in just about every baggage claim area. You are patched directly to the front desk, they'll waste no time answering, will tell you exactly where to wait, and the shuttle will arrive quickly. On this particular visit, I stayed in room 230, and everything was in excellent shape. The only thing I noticed was that the king bed was actually two twins that were pushed together, but I didn't realize this until it was time to check out so obviously didn't have any issues. The room was located overlooking the courtyard, which was a lot quieter that the room on the parking lot side I had on my last visit. Free wifi is always a big plus, and the Greek restaurant at the rear of the property is awesome - Aliki's Greek Taverna. The property has a pool, free coffee/tea, and complimentary cereals and toast, although I didn't utilize any of these amenities. The ice machine in the parking lot was in great working order and could only be turned on by inserting a room key. As some other reviewers have mentioned, yes, airplane noise will be heard. I've talked to lots of friends that have stayed in just about every hotel in the LAX airport area, as far as 8 miles down the road from the terminals, and this is not a problem that's unique with just the Super 8, you'll get it anywhere. If noise is an issue, book miles away from the airport. I was having a hard time finding locations of nearby stores and restaurants within walking distance before my trip, and this area is generally nothing but hotels and rental car agencies, so here's what's around: Burger King is on Airport Blvd. about a block and a half away, on the opposite side of the road. It's visible from the front of the property. 7 Eleven is up the road in the other direction, on the corner of Airport Blvd. and Manchester Ave. Walking down Westchester will take you directly into an area of Sepulveda Blvd. which has In N Out Burger, Ralph's Supermarket, Boston Market, Pizza Hut, and many others.

Eventually, if nothing works out, you give in, Super 8 Motel. You just need to rest, you didn't have planned to stay in LA. This motel is your safety nest. a shuttle will gladly pick you up at the airport, really. The staff will work with you to ensure your stay is comfortable. I was glad to find this motel was pretty neat. Planes will be kinda disturbing, and the room might not be well maintained. But the Wi-Fi, cable, shuttle, continental breakfast, comfort and price all make this a wonderful unexpected stay. Stress gone. $69 bucks, GREAT BUY. Also, if you did want to visit Los Angeles and its many attractions, restaurants and all that, I would recommend it. Your going to be out of your room for most of your stay, and why not save some bucks. Very convenient to get to Disneyland, and other attractions/resturants/beaches and all that.", "Date": "December 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFlight path\u201d", "Author": "aussie2008", "ReviewID": "UR19669174", "Content": "The motel was convenient to LAX had the rooms were good for the price.
