Our room faced the busy main street and got bright early morning, the carpets were dirty, the bathrooms was clean, but the shower curtain was a cheap dollar store quality flying all over you while you are trying to take a shower. Also the A/C was switched off, apparently the city controls when to switch them on or atleast that's what we were told, in a rude way, I must add by the concierge Mr. Emmanuella, who was one of the rudest front desk person I've ever encountered.

It was a choice of 3 hotels and we chose this one as it had more Venetian character than the other 2 on offer which looked more contemporary/chain. We found the hotel very easily as it's just across the main bridge from the bus station. Location wise - it's perfect for arriving and leaving as you don't have to trek all across the city. It's only down the road from the Ferrovia waterbus stops. It's a fair walk to San Marco but to be honest once we went there, we didn't really need to go back again as there were lots of other sights to see nearby. The outside of the hotel looked very impressive and pretty much looked how I'd imagine it to be. The service was great - we didn't ask for anything during our stay so I can't comment if we had done so. They expect the keys to be returned to the desk each and every time you leave the hotel which we found odd as never experienced that courtesy. The lift was small but we didn't have much to carry so we used the stairs instead. I could imagine if we had more it would have been quite uncomfortable. The room was lovely! Exactly what I expected it to be d\u00c3\u00a9cor wise. The shower head was quite old and rusty in places so we had to use a cocktail stick to poke through the holes so more water came out! The bed was comfy - more comfy than most hotels we've stayed in. Breakfast was a hot and cold buffet - was expecting a cold buffet so was pleasantly surprised when there was bacon, eggs and toast on offer. As we knew Venice was going to be quite expensive to eat out this was a perfect solution to our budget! I wouldn't have ordinarily chosen this hotel if it wasn't part of an online offer, however we really enjoyed our stay and it looks like we were very lucky with room 309 based on what other reviewers have said about theirs! We knew this was going to be an older style hotel - the walls were pretty thin and it could do with a lick of paint here and there and maybe if another online offer came about we would stay there again; however the only thing I would comment on is that it didn't really feel like a 4* hotel - just a posh 3*", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cThis should be downgraded to a 2 star property\u201d", "Author": "LondonIrishlass", "ReviewID": "UR127324940", "Content": "Having been so upset by the standard of hotels and changed rooms in other hotels I was too jaded to speak to reception to get this changed. The lift is miniscule and just about took me, my husband, one large and one small suitcase at a push. The door of our room had to be shoved open as it got wedged before opening fully. There was a damp spot and hole in the ceiling, the ceiling tiles above the doorway were scuffed and scratched, the wallpaper to the corner was torn, the wall light fitting was loose, the window frame was loose, the plaster above the window frame was coming away in chunks, there were gaps in the ceiling tiles over the bath, the shower head fitting was not fitted together so water came out of the holes and across the top of the shower from the gap. My biggest gripe was the unusal step in the bathroom - the toilet and the bidet were on the step but you could not comfortably put your feet on the step and in my case because I am short had the lean forward on my tiptoes while cutting off the circulation to my legs. The window in the hall was broken with pieces of glass missing. On two occasions we came back to our room to find it unlocked after housekeeping. On the first occasion I was extremely distressed as I had left my handbag in the room on the floor on my way to breakfast and on my return from breakfast there it was sitting on the freshly made bed in an unlocked room. The problem with this is that it is very clear to see when a room is unlocked as it shows white when unlocked and red when locked above the door handle. The bed was large and comfortable, the pillows were flat and hard. I either had the covers up to my chin or thrown off as the heating seemed to have a mind of its own. We could hear our neighbours use the bathroom as the plumbing system was very loud and when the hairdryer was used. I had no sleep one night when the local restaurant decided that they were going to clean the kitchen with much banging of plates and dropping of pans - closing the back door of the kitchen might have helped. Breakfast is plentiful with scrambled eggs and bacon on offer as the hot option. There is also cheese and ham available. There are croissants all of which are glazed some with jam as a filling as some with honey. There is fruit salad also. On our first few mornings coffee pots were brought out to us (bland weak coffee). On our final morning we came down to a shiny new drinks dispenser - finally a decent strong cup of coffee. However, it does sound like you are on the set of a sci-fi movie with all the noises it makes. I was surprised there were not more cold meats or even tomatoes as an option. The hotel is in a wonderful location between Guglie and Ferrovia Vaporetto stops. There are lots of shops and restaurants in the area and you are a 5 minute walk from the train station and 10 minutes over the large bridge to the bus station. It is about a 20-25 walk to San Marco. We ate a couple of times in Ae Oche just down from the hotel towards Ferrovia. Avoid the restaurant to the left on exiting the hotel. Restaurants can add both a 12% service charge and a cover charge and do not be caught out as we were with the Venice tourist tax which you will be asked to pay on signing out of the hotel. This is not a cheap city even McDonalds is ridiculously expensive. If this hotel smartened up it could become a 4 star establishment again but it does need some serious work.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat property\u201d", "Author": "uptowngirl57", "ReviewID": "UR126859412", "Content": "We were \"bumped\" to this hotel by it's sister property, Hotel Grand Principe - across the street and 50 yards away. We loved it - a little more intimate but with spacious beautiful rooms. We were initially disappointed since the other hotel is on the Grand Canal, but we had paid for lower-priced rooms and really didn't expect to face the water, and our rooms in the Amadeus were probably much better than the ones we would have gotten across the street. One note- many of the guide books warn you against staying near the train station because it's busy and touristy. However, included in our group of 8 were my parents, age 80, who simply could not have dragged their luggage through the streets of Venice, up and down bridges, like so many people we saw who stayed away from the main area but who weren't on a canal accessible by boat. I am a fit marathon runner and I can tell you that I wouldn't have wanted to carry my luggage across Venice. So staying near the station was terrific for us - easy vaporetto access to everywhere. The staff was very friendly and helpful - including the night before we left, when just as I was drifting off to sleep I realized I'd left a shopping bag in our dinner restaurant down the street. The person at the desk (wish I'd gotten his name) helped me figure out the name of the restaurant on Google, then called them and caught them as they were closing and asked them to wait. My husband and I threw on some jeans and hustled over there and retreived the bag, but it wouldn't have happened without his help. They also facilitated our communication with our water taxi to the airport, which had been faxed to the hotel we were bumped from and not forwarded. Very, very helpful staff. The hotel has a lovely breakfast room and bar, with white fabric-draped chairs and tables, pretty flowered china, and chafing dish service of hot and cold foods. Breakfast was included and was more than ample to hold you until lunch. And, the bartender in the evening went out of his way to make American-style cocktails for us (including very good Mojitos.) The bathrooms were marble and had excellent hot water pressure. The rooms feature mini bars, and a pillow selection in terms of firmness, along with individual room temp controls.

When we arrived we were taken to what is obviously their \"first offer\" for travelers that may not have any fight left in them. This was at the back of the hotel accessed from a very small and rickety lift. The room they showed us looked like it was rented by the hour. Very shabby, worn, smelly, dirty and frayed with 2 single beds with 2 single sheet sets pushed together. The porter arrived at our door without our bags in clear anticipation of what was to come in a way that seemed like he had been through it a few times before.

After explaining that we were on our honeymoon and the room was far from romantic despite being in Venice, they then denied they had any knowledge that we were on our honeymoon and it was not their fault we were taken to that room. This begs the question as to who this room is actually for? Perhaps someone that desires a room that looks like a motel on a remote highway rather than the 4 star accommodation they had paid for? We were then taken to a much better part of the hotel at the front of the building. The decor was a big improvement but we were shown a very small room with about 2 cm of mold growing over the bathroom.

I was not happy about this, because I did not get a discount on the price I had accepted for the Principe, ie for a higher quality of service and amenity. The Amadeus is a good 3-star hotel that claims to be a 4-star one. It's on Lista di Spagna, a few doors down from the Principe on the other side of the street. The area is fine - it has plenty of restaurants, shops and hotels, and is close to St Lucia station and the Ferrovia vaporetto stops. The hotel is a bit dated, its furniture and panelling recall the post-war years, and the feeling is one of staidness. However the staff were friendly and helpful, and always courteous, even when having to enforce the requirements of the Italian Government regarding registering foreigners (copying passports). The room was fairly spacious, but the double bed turned out to be two single beds made up separately and then pushed together - so no room to stretch out. The bathroom had a shower over the bath - always a worry when you're elderly and at risk of slipping and falling. Unfortunately, the shower rose was almost completely blocked up, so a few jets of water shot out in all directions but not on the body standing underneath hoping for a warm stream of water. It was necessary to use the body rinsing shower for the bath to have a shower. Another problem with the bathroom was that, despite having a heater that was on all the time, the room never got warm. Breakfast was a buffet, but the only hot dishes were scrambled egg and bacon - hardly 4-star stuff. Also, there was no fresh fruit, but there were tinned fruit salad and pineapple, poor substitutes at best. Also, the orange juice was tinned also. For toast there were round slices of brown (pumpernickel) or white bread, but a number of people tried slicing the bread rolls in half and toasting them, much too the anxiety of the staff when a bit of roll got stuck in the toaster and could be smelt burning.

It was filthy and away from the shops and tourist attractions and restaurants. Our room had 3 beds shoved into a smelly dirty room. There was mould on the ceiling, and cracks in the walls, with lumps of plaster cracking and falling on the floor. \"The bathroom was filthy.

I phoned the angry man at the front desk who said we had to connect it to the tv. There was no means to do this. So I phoned him again, and he said he would send a man from another hotel nearby to help us. Half an hour later a guy arrives, fiddles around with the tv which didn't work properly and informs us that the internet connection is non existant. He phoned the front desk to inform the guy who said there was nothing he could do. We were desperate to get out of here and didn't want to sleep the night. Next I tried phoning family in Australia to see if they could find something on the internet to book us in. The phone didn't work. There was no reception for my mobile phone (I realise this wasn't the hotels fault) however my teenage son had $30 left on his mobile which did have reception. We phoned family in Aust. explained our predicament and asked for help explaining the mobile phone credits would run out soon (which it did after that call.) By now it was around 2 am. Family booked us into a gorgeous hotel in the heart of Venice and tried to phone the hotel to let us know. The man at the front desk supposedly put the phone calls through to our room but we never received them. After one hour with no phone calls coming into our room I tried to phone Australia but the phone wasn't working. I tried for quite some time. In the meantime family trying to be put through into our room and front desk man saying he was trying to put us through but we weren't answering and must be asleep. We were not asleep. We tried to use the phone but it was dead. Family asked him to walk up to our room and let us know that they were trying to phone us, but the guy refused. Our room phone was intermittent. Our cousin phoned us to tell us she had found a hotel and booked it for us but the phone call cut out. We tried phoning our cousin, and other family members who were worried but the phone wasn't working again. Around 6.30 am after our family members had been constantly phoning and trying to get through to us, our cousin insisted someone take a message to us in our room which read \"answer your phone\". I realised that people had been trying to call us all night. I informed the man at the front desk that the phone was not working and he said that he would get an engineer to work on the phone some time today (engineer??). We looked into the poky, dingy old room that was supposed to be the breakfast room, as we were going to eat breakfast before we left, however, the small amount of food looked of poor quality. Scrambled eggs looked old and stale. Bacon was all fat and greasy. My daughter put a piece of canned pineapple on her plate and had a coffee and was going to have another pineapple ring but the waiter packed it away while my daughter was standing in front of it. I ate nothing. My son ate a stale bread roll.

After we arrived at the Principe, they looked up our name and told us that we were being transferred to Hotel Amadeus due to air conditioning problems. We then had to drag our bags down to Hotel Amadeus. Other people were checking in at Principe while we were there, so I'm not really sure if that was the truth. I wouldn't recommend either one if they would do this to guests. Seems to be common. They did however put us in a pretty large room. Aside from all this, my husband and I travel a lot and we are not picky at all. We just ask for a clean room and nice staff members. The room was fine, but the staff completely ruined my stay. They made me feel pretty bad. My husband and I were leaving the hotel at about 11:00 one night to just walk around as everyone else was doing. We had been taking our keys with us the entire time and didn't think about leaving it at the desk, but an older man at the desk asked for it before we left. My husband simply said, \"Oh, I didn't know I had to leave it, but that's not a problem, you're the first person to ask for it.\" The old man yelled at us and said, \"What do you mean I'm the first one to tell you?\" and mumbled some stuff under his breath. He then said that he was going to lock the hotel soon, so we were confused. We asked him how we would get in and he shrugged his shoulders. Still calm, we asked him what time and he said he didn't know. We were completely confused. We're very laid back people and don't do a lot of complaining so we ended up picking up some water and snacks and came right back. At this point, we thought maybe it was all a mix up or misunderstanding. That night was ruined, but I was still okay at this point. The next morning, we approached a tall younger man at the desk and was wondering about the door locking policy at the hotel. First, he ignored us and kept helping other people that came to the desk. We finally asked him about it and he blew us off and said that it was \"impossible\", whatever that may mean. We then asked him what we should do if it was locked and he said, just ring the door bell and someone will come. That's all he had to say. Instead, he added that if we want to complain, then go ahead and write a manager complaint card and rudely told us again that it was impossible. This really did it for me. We would've been fine with just a simple explanation. He was not trying to help us. My husband and I are in our 30's, but look fairly young, but that does not give someone the right to treat us like that. It really upset me a lot. I've stayed at so many places and have never felt so bad. It's hard to explain how rude they were. My explanation is pretty low key. I also noticed how they spoke to minorities, especially if they don't speak Italian. We noticed an incident when we first arrived. They have no respect.
