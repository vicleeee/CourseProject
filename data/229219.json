I was traveling with a friend and didn't care much about the room, mostly cared about price and location. As far as location goes, this is a good hotel, as far is price, you get what you pay for or less. This hotel is advertised as a 4 star facility and is priced as a 3 star facility. It is more like a bare minimum 3 star facility than anything else. I mean, there was a plaque with Ice cream pricing in the elevator, hardly classy. There is no restaurant, only break fest. Not to mention room service. The lobby bar is serviced by the same person at the front desk. They are not always friendly, sometimes very rood. 1 thing was horrible during our stay. The WiFi access is 12.5Euros a night if you take it for 7nights or more (I don't remember how much the price was for just 2-3 nights but obviously even more than this insane price). I have an internet based company and had to be online most of the time, I had to pay this insane charge. The problem is, that even though the price was horrible the internet connection was even worse. First 2-3 nights it was decent. Not great, decent. Later on it got worse and worse. When I told the front desk about it they said that they are aware of the problem and its because we are on the top (5th) floor. When I told them that its unacceptable that the internet keeps disconnecting even though I am paying an insane price, they gave me a 25Euro discount for the entire package. That was ok, I guess, but the internet connection got even worse and the last day I couldn't even connect at all. The night before checkout I spoke with the only decent employee and he understood the issue, he said that he will leave a message for the front desk manager and she will take care of the issue (I was expecting a full refund of the charge). The next morning (check out time) The front desk manager was extremely rood, called me a liar to my face in front of my friend, and a family friend that came to pick us up, and didn't even give me the 25Euro discount that her employees promised 2 days earlier! I was outraged and furious to the point of blurred vision. I cannot recommend this establishment and I am very, disappointed and very surprised at the holiday inn franchise, they are usually very good as far as service goes.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cFeedback following vist\u201d", "Author": "Manics", "ReviewID": "UR121198611", "Content": "I stayed at the above hotel for 4 days at the end of November 2011.

My boyfriend and I wanted to set up shop at a hotel in Berlin to finish out the end of our vacation. We specifically chose this hotel because it advertised that guests could rent movies in their room if desired (English movies specifically). I also called to confirm that they had English movies before I booked the hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel and getting our room, we attempted to order movies on two out of the three movie channels (the third channel option was the porn channel). The movie system wasn't working properly so we called the front desk to see if they could help. It was obvious that the front desk wasn't enthused that we asked for help, but, nonetheless, someone was sent up to our room. When the employee arrived in our room, he tried to get the movie channels to work and was unsucessful. The porn station was working, however, and the employee let us know that this channel was still an option. Being with my boyfriend, of course, I was a bit offended by this suggestion as the last thing I was planning on doing in Berlin was watching porn. We checked later with the front desk and a female employee informed us that an electrician would be fixing the tv the next day. The following evening, the movie stations still weren't working properly. I went downstairs to check with the front desk and the same female employee told me that the the electrician was \"coming tomorrow.\" I also inquired about the German to English toggle switch that exisisted on the TV and the employee informed me that this function never worked to begin with. I was definately annoyed at this point. I understand that we were in Germany and we shouldn't expect that everything on TV or the movies will be in English. However, I thought it was false advertising that we could watch English movies. It's a good location, but you can probably find a hotel with better amenities for a better price. I wouldn't recommend it and I'm sure the porn channel is still working just fine.

Room doors still open with those big keys as in old hotels, no access cards. My room was in the ground floor with a small neglected backyard full of rubbish. I had to ask the staff several times before they removed the rubbish in front of my window, so it stayed there a few days. I have seen several bugs on the walls or on my bed during my stay. I paid 12.50\u20ac per day to use the wifi connection. It is definitely overpriced, and on top of that the connection goes down every 5 minutes to ask for user login again, making it impossible to work or browse the internet normally. Also, there was no electric plug close to my bed so I could not recharge my phone and laptop while using them from the bed. There is no tea/coffee facility in the room.

After over 30 stays in the past with Priceline without a problem, this was the first time I felt like I was stuck in a 2nd rate room. The entire room smelled horribly of smoke and the staff seemed indifferent when I requested a non-smoking room. Even as a Priority Club Member with Platinum status, I wasn't expecting any sort of upgrade, but they couldn't even accomodate a room type request. They had the keys set aside before check-in and didn't seem to want to go through the hassle of changing anything. Not to be sexist, but I agree with other reviews of the female staff not being helpful or personable. They seemed to be sitting around and not doing work most of the time, while the only guy I saw during my stay seemed to be doing all the work. Otherwise, the location is great for access to the shopping area and restaurants. It's less than a 10 minute walk to the Zoo Garten train station, the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, and there was even a nice Hard Rock Cafe a few streets down.", "Date": "September 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Formby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201crude staff, very bad experience\u201d", "Author": "smast", "ReviewID": "UR5829667", "Content": "The only good thing about this hotel was the location as is it near the ku,dam one of Berlins main shopping streets, Room was dirty and tired with a small bathroom, on checking out they tried to charge me 12. euro for a movie i did not watch as i was out of the room at the time!!, I left a shirt in the wardrobe of the room and upon going back to collect it the next day i was told it was not there and couldnt be found, the Female manager was very rude and intollerant., i was going to stay a week and left after the first night, i was also charged 10.00 euro extra for having 2 people in the room. never again", "Date": "September 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "4", "Value": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cgo for shopping & sightseeing\u201d", "Author": "sbwsbw", "ReviewID": "UR5298304", "Content": "Bus stop just 2mins walk, hight street is 1 min. the female staffs were rude and not helpfull. tehy even tried to charge more than it should be.

On the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, very close to the hotel, you can take the Berlin hop on hop off tour. Also the Berlin musical theatre Theater des Westens is within walking distance of the hotel.
