I went for a longer walk to the Musee D'orsay which took less than an hour and was very nice walking along the river.

From the elevators that do not hold more than 2 people and can't decide if it it's going to stop on floor 1 or 2 is a joke. The rooms are not just small, but almost the size of the safe that is in the closet, by the way there is no point in having a safe in the room unless you want to pull a muscle getting into it. Oh yes, there is a closet, but you need to be on the otherside of the bed inorder to hang something. The bathrooms were an adequate size, except I had to house a piece of luggage in there. Yes this is a eco friendly hotel, everytime we got off the elevator we had to turn on the light which had a timer so you better have your key ready for the door.

The reception staff were very polite and helpful at check in and spoke to us in English, which was a relief, as we only speak basic French. We were checked into a first floor street-facing room, right next to the lift and even though the windows kept the street noise out, the lift noise did not make for a good night's sleep. When I spoke to reception the next morning re: switching rooms, they advised of other available double rooms we could have and we took up the offer of a ground floor room in the courtyard, which was much quieter and did us fine for the rest of our stay. The rooms are small, but they have adequate en-suites, fridge and tea/coffee making facilities. The drawers did need a wipe clean before we unpacked into them, but on the plus side, the beds are very comfortable and you get a great night's sleep. We did not take breakfast at the hotel, as there are so many good bakeries nearby. It is a good base in an area of Paris that felt safe walking around at night - mostly student area. Rue Mouffetard is just behind the hotel (turn right going out the hotel and right again up Rue Rollin) and has fabulous places to eat and drink. If you ask for a glass of white wine you are offered Chablis / similar good quality for only 4 euros. There are many good quality, traditional restaurants that offer excellent quality 3-course lunches/dinners for around 10 euros. The best ones we tried were Bistro Garamond, which had a nice bar across the street for pre-dinner cocktails for 5 euros and Le Mouff'tot Moufftard. Further down Rue Mouffetard is an asian cafe called Comestibles where you get a starter, a main and a soft drink for 6.5 euros. This was a perfect place for lunch, spotlessly clean and some of the nicest Chinese food we'd had in a while. On our first visit to Paris we used the metro to get around and this time we used the red open top bus (Les Cars Rouges). Thankfully we did not book the ticket in advance as our flight was delayed, so just bought the ticket on the bus the next day. The nearest stop for this service is a 5 minute walk at the far side of Notre Dame and a 1-day ticket lasts 2. This is the best way to get your bearings and you can get dropped off/picked up at a number of stops near the main attractions. The Louvre is free entry on the first Sunday of the month, but Napoleon's tomb is closed on the first Monday of the month. If you are coming from CDG airport by RER train, the hotel advises changing to metro line 7 at gare du nord. We found this quite stressful as it was extremely crowded, so on the way back to the airport, opted to take the RER from Jardin Du Luxembourg. It's only 9 euros for the ticket which is good on the metro and RER, so recommend this, but check the RER stops at Jardin Du Luxembourg as some are express services. When you get off at Jardin Luxembourg, the hotel is 5-10 min. walk - take exit 1- Place Edmond Rostand, cross the road and take 2nd street on right - Rue Soufflot towards the Panthenon at the top and the hotel is just a couple of streets behind the Panthenon.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOne of the worst places I have ever been\u201d", "Author": "Creng", "ReviewID": "UR120266357", "Content": "At first glance the hotel seemed close for refurbishment: no visible lights from outside.

You are between 2 metro stops - Cardinal Lemoine and Place Monge. There are some interesting eateries nearby on Mufftard. I enjoyed walking to Notre Dame across the Pont de Tournelle. Interestingly, near that bridge is an expensive restaurant, La Tour de A'rgent! (too pricey for me) I was with a small group staying at this hotel. We had twin beds. The rooms are small, but the bath was sufficient. (That's where we stored our luggage). The hotel personnel are very friendly and helpful and speak English. Breakfast was included in our price. It did not change during our week stay - scrambled eggs, limpy bacon, sausage, packaged cheese, croissants/bread, cut fruit, yogurt, juice, coffee, tea. It was ok and convenient. There is a bakery down the street. You can sit in the dining area anytime of the day. I did not bring any techie toys with me, but I did note that the wifi is NOT free. There is a computer in the lobby with a 8euro for a half hour charge. Our room was cleaned and straightened everyday. If one had a problem, just let the front desk know and they took care of it immediately. If you are not use to European hotels, it may surprise you at how small the rooms and hallway are. I was, but others in my group said this was pretty standard. We had a inside room (#41) and were not bothered too much by noise from outside. Most noise issues were with hotel occupants talking in the narrow hall or walking heavy. The beds are very firm. I like the quality of the sheets.

This is a smaller, older hotel with a bit of character, a little worn around the edges maybe, but gives great service and is clean and tidy. Most important was the comfy bed, we could control the air conditioning to suit us in our room and the mini bar had several types of non-alcoholic drink choices as well (Tobberone chocolate and Pringle chips too:) The bathroom had a hairdryer and despite what a previous review had led us to believe the shower did have a shower door. While our room did not have a view that was not important to us as we were only their to sleep. The rooms are an adequate size and there is a lounge downstairs by reception which also provides newspapers - we appreciated the one in English. Unfortunately we could not access our e.mails from the computer - not sure why - and it did not have a qwerty keyboard. Not a big deal to us when on holiday and it could have been our lack of computer skills. The buffet breakfast was fantastic with so many choices and catered for different nationalities as well. I don't drink tea or coffee so was most appreciative of the hot milk and pkt chocolate powder for my morning cuppa - most impressed with the whole breakfast experience. The location was great! We could walk directly down our street and the one following on and get to Notre Dame in about a 15 minutes stroll. Along the way was a small supermarket that we could pick up pre-packaged sandwiches,salads, fruit, drink etc. at reasonable prices to put in our backpack for lunch. Up the road was a good market (I bought a couple of really nice skirts) and all around were shops and a huge variety of restaurants all in a basic suburban like area. The Metro underground was only a couple of minutes up the road from the hotel for those more confident than us - very close by. August was a good time to be in Paris this year. We struck warm weather - mid 20's - just right for strolling around in summer clothes and not too hot or humid except one day that got to the 30's. We were only there for three nights so we got a two day pass for the L'Tour hop-on, hop-off bus and boat tour as it was the only company that offered the combined pass. It was good value and one of the pick-up points for the bus was only a couple of short blocks from the hotel in St Germain Boulevard. The nearest boat pick-up was at our side of Notre Dame so both easily accessed. I hadn't been to Paris before and this way I got to see a lot in a short time. Most enjoyable too. I had bought a small Lonely Planet language guide before I went and had tried to learn some of the phrases and signs e.g. Sortie meant Exit.

Nothing special about this place, don't stay here if you are wanting to spend any time in the hotel. As a base it's got a good location very close to two Metro lines and some of the tourist sites in relatively easy walking; main ones being Notre Dame, Louvre and the associated parks. The latin quater offers much cheaper options for eating in resturants that don't all have multilanguage menus ready for you or feel contrived. Head out of the hotel (right out of the hotel, and right again and head up) to the mouffetard area for a good collection of restaurants and bars that pretty much cover everything you could want for eating and drinking. Head elsewhere for fine dining though. Definitely recommend going to eat at the restaurant at the top left of Rue Rollin (unfortunately I didn't get the name and what's there on google street map is out of date). Checked red table cloths and very typically french (parisian) food at good prices - the other diners appeared to be locals. Can't comment on the breakfast in the hotel as we didn't take that option. Personally, I wouldn't bother. There's plenty of places close offering croissant and cafe for about 3 euro's or even full breakfast menu's for less than the hotel. Or better still just grab something out while appreciating a view somewhere. Only thing I would avoid is any room on the first floor, especially room 14. There's quite a bit of noise from the ground floor (breakfast noise etc) and most annoying is the electic motor for the hotel's front door which automatically opens any time anyone gets close to the door and seems to go into overdrive with people coming and going from about 6am-9am.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat place away - close enough but away from the crowds\u201d", "Author": "RosLondon", "ReviewID": "UR116596202", "Content": "We were celebrating a friend's 50th birthday and wanted a small hotel away from the main crowds.

Room and bathroom were clean and everything worked as it should. the shower cubicle was a little on the small size, but that's nit-picking really. we were on the 6th floor with 3 balconies overlooking rue monge and with views of notre dame and sacre couer. plenty of local shops / cafes / restaurants and a very reasonable supermarket (Carrefour) within 5 mins walk (shop here for your bottled water etc as its VERY expensive in cafes and tourist areas).

The rooms are tiny, which is expected in a 3 star Paris hotel, but they are clean and the bathrooms are good sized and ours was updated. We asked for an off-street room and were easily accommodated. There is a safety concern with the bathtubs as there were no mats or grab bars and the European tubs have high sides so it's risky getting in and out. And if you are a plus size person you'll have trouble taking a bath here as these tubs are deep and narrow. Even though the rooms are tiny in size, there is a closet and drawer space that allows you to unpack and stow everything, although there's not really a way to stow two suitcases and two carryons easily. The air conditioning was working fine and quickly cooled our room when we needed it. The beds & pillows were comfortable and we both slept like a rock. The breakfast was fairly typical, croissants, toast, scrambled eggs, sausage and (undercooked) bacon, plus cereal, yogurt, cheese and beverages.

The receptionist couldn't have been more helpful until it transpired that he had no record of our booking, then his attitude changed - which I think is a French thing rather than a thing personal to him. We gave him our booking reference and showed him the paperwork and left it to him to sort whilst we went out. We returned at around 4, and it transpired that laterooms apparently hadn't faxed through the initial booking, hence the initial confusion. He had accommodated our request to be on the 5th floor in a twin room, the only problem being that they had only just started cleaning it! I am assuming this was because he had to shuffle things around and this took time, as on the Sunday we came back at around the same time and the room was spotless. The room was very small (as you would expect in a 3* Parisian hotel), but very nicely furnished and done in such a way as to give plenty of storage. Large bathroom (no shower curtain on the bath, which would have been helpful as we didn't have a separate shower). Considering there were 2 of us with a case each, we didn't have any problems moving about the place. The air con was a blessing, and we had no issues with noise or anything else.

We had breakfast at a lovely cafe - Cafe Delmas on Rue Mouffetard, the whole of this area was lovely so can't comment on food at the hotel, but excellent location within easy walk of the Notre Dame, Pantheon, Jardins des Luxembourg and many more - woudl recommend.", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel des Nations St-Germain", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d229560-Reviews-Hotel_des_Nations_St_Germain-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$135 - $252*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">54 rue Monge</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75005</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "229560", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/80/6a/806a07a661d99a6d43194e0b78f8d3158large.jpg"}}
