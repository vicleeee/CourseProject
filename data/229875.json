For first 4 nights very quiet. Hotel is being refurbished so there was some hammering which started at 08.30 on the last 3 mornings of our stay (people have to work!) One night, we returned quite late because of babysitting grandchildren and the whole of reception area was being painted. Next morning it was back to its purpose without any remains of the painters except for a fresh look! On final night there was partying in the next room but when we went to reception they dealt with it immediately. Anything extra we asked for, eg pillows, was provided within 5 minutes. Breakfast provided more food then we needed and the waitress worked efficiently in a courteous way. Cleaniness was excellent with cloths changed after every person breakfasting. Room was quite adequate for what we needed. Always lots of hot water at all times with good pressure. Tioletries and towels provided everyday. I even think that bed linen was changed every day or the beds were made so well that it seemed they were!

The room had key operated electrics which not only switched off the lights when you left but also the mains electric which included the fridge! The room safe didn\u2019t work and took two days of maintenance man visits to fix. I was able to use safety deposit boxes in reception though. As it was November they had decided to turn off the air conditioning to all rooms regardless of whether you wanted it or not. I had to sleep with the window open which meant I had to put up with car horns and general traffic noise. On the plus side the rooms were clean and the breakfast was nice.

They moved us in an other room immediatly. We asked to discuss with the manager but they told us it is not possible because it is sunday. At the end of the day we had the first signs on our skin, more then one hundred of papula and a lot of itch. Next morning we saw a new insect in bed but a lot of new lesions. Again it was not possible to talk with the manager because even though we announced we want to go out after 9 o'clock because we were in holiday he didnt't come. The skin was worse and worse and in the end of the day we go to the doctor. After a new night (yes it was our mistake we didn't move immediatly) in an other hotel) of terror we went again to the doctor and only after we present the report of the doctor the manager came to talk with us. And he told us that we do not have to pay the first night and that they will pay the doctor and the medication. Of course we asked what will happen with our broken holiday, with the risk to carry with us the insects (we discovered meantime they were bed bugs) with the risk to catch some disease but the response was that they evacuated the rooms from that floor and they will make disinsection. After that we moved in another place. So of course they do not carry about our holiday which was a calvaire and about the risk we have to take in our baggages the bed bugs and so to have otherr problems at our return home. We can't understand how it could happen and we do not understand the reaction they had. Now we are back home (just arrived) and we started to look for advices about what we have to do now with our things.
