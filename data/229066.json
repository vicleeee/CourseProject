It is within very easy walking distance of San Marco. Be aware that this hotel has an annex across a small internal courtyard - our room was in that. The room had 2 windows, one opening onto a central air shaft and the other opening onto a view of an air conditioning unit about 2 metres away. The annex rooms have their own breakfast room, with a handful of 2-seater tables arranged side-by-side in a line in a (richly decorated) hallway where the buffet breakfast is set out. This was the worst part of the experience, because the breakfast is prepared right outside your bedroom door and it is inevitably going to be noisy. The room itself was richly furnished, although small. There was only single chair for a double room. You had to be quite a contortionist to use the bathroom, which did not have a fixed shower, only something relating to the taps of the bath and which you had to hold up yourself. Above our room in the Annex was at least another couple of floors which seemed to be nothing to do with the hotel. We could hear the occupants of the room above us get out of bed sharp at 6:30 every morning and clatter around for an hour or so before, presumeably, setting off to work. The staff were unfailingly friendly, and prepared to speak English. They provided helpful suggestions, and seemed genuinely friendly. The main part of the hotel has a sort of sitting room, plus a very small bar, again very richly furnished. We visited in the week following Easter Sunday, and were delighted to find that a large Easter Egg was divided up by the hotel for all the patrons - this was a very nice touch. I suppose that the Annex rooms are cheaper, but if you want to have a canal view or to be in the main hotel take care to specify this when booking!", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cCharming\u201d", "Author": "Pimento", "ReviewID": "UR128123711", "Content": "The staff at this hotel made us feel very welcome!

Unfortunately I do not remember our 2nd floor room number but if you need a larger room, make sure to specify at the time that you book because all rooms are not created equally. Also, while this hotel does have their own dock for the water taxis, if the tide is too high the boat may not be able to make use of it.

Our first impression was as we pulled up to the hotel's private dock via a water taxi (hired at airport). Such a wonderful and unique expirence it was. The hotel greeted us as we unboarded the boat while they handled our bags. The check in was hassle free and then we were guided to our room. The room was small, which to my understanding is common is Europe, but it was cozy, clean and had a good sized bathroom. The maid service was good as well giving us turndown service each day while leaving us chocolate on our pilliows along with the next days weather report. The hotel staff were all friendly and helpful. In particular, Marco at the front desk was a pleasure. He helped us find good restuarants, hired a private canal boat tour for us and serveral other hotel guests and was always in the mood to just chat about everything and anything. He made us feel very welcomed during our entire stay. The location is perhaps the best feature of the hotel. It is minutes from Saint Marks Sq, about 10 minutes from the Rialto Bridge, and minutes from the public boat dock (their version of a city bus) that can take you anywhere you weren't willing to walk to. The only complaint I would have was that the room was on the hot side. Our solution, of course, was to open the window as we slept. This was a perfect invite for mosquitos to attack us all night. By the 3rd night, we had to sleep with no window open in order to avoid the mosquitos. A perfect remedy for this would simply to put screens over the windows...then it'd be problem solved. All in all, I would stay here again. I would come better prepared next time with a face fan that works on 220v :( Venice is a wonderful place and the Hotel Colombina really helps you expirence the city the way it meant to be.

We had two beautifully enormous, shuttered windows that opened to the canal below so that we could see gondoliers rowing by. Did I mention it was magical?

The breakfast was very nice, comprising of croissants, fruit juice, rice crispies, muesli, prunes, ham, cheese. On our final morning there was a gorgeously moist almond cake. Oh I forgot, the coffee is lovely and strong - just how we like it!! As an example of how good the staff are, when we returned to Manchester airport my wife found that she didn't have her mobile phone with her.

We wrote back and forth so many times, that it was almost like family when we arrived. Instead of 2 rooms, we chose a suite for just a bit more $, and it was great. Spacious and beautifully appointed. The breakfast buffet was very good and in a beautiful space. The staff was fantastic. When the desk clerk asked us what we were doing that day, he said \"no no\".

The entire city of Venice has a problem of rip-off their tourists. For $300/night, you don't have any scene, only a wall.

Why not replace it with something like \"sorry, but we are fully-booked now\" or \"the room upgrade is available upon extra payment, is this what you want\", etc.. Then we made a mistake of let the hotel arrange a motorboat for us. We shared it with another couple and four old ladies\u00ef\u00bc\u0152 so total of 8 people although we were told it would be six people. Then our dear hotel staff told us that we have to pay hotel \"cash only\". This is ridicules! We were told they will give the cash to motorboat owner therefore cash is the only option. Think about it, we are their guests, they want us to pay 100 euros in cash! Regular price? Please, don't tell me the hotel itself will give 100% of our money to the boat owner. The best part if, then immediately when we aboard the boat, we found out that the price we paid is full-price without any discount. In that case, why do we need them to arrange it for us? We can simply walk out of the hotel, negotiate the price with boat owner directly, those motorboat and gondolas are everywhere! Anyway, we learned a lesson, so next day, we refused their offer of gondola, which is either 100 euro for my husband and I only, or share with another two couples and pay 30 euro each person. Then after two minutes walking outside the hotel, we found a deal, only 60 euros for us, not sharing with anyone! Like I said, don't take their offer on those stuff! Then, the annex room, although it's still cost nearly $300/night, the shower room is only 2 feet by 2 feet (yes, I did not spell wrong), without shelf to put our shampoo and other stuff. We had to keep the exhausting fan entire day, otherwise the room became very stink, quickly! Breakfast? Worst of the worst among the three hotels we stayed for this trip.

However, the next morning, they won't let us leave unless we pay 3 euros for our \"international call\". No matter how we explained, they insisted we had to pay. I paid so I can get out of this ripping-off hotel. When I got home, American Express reimbursed me the money. However, this hotel had us double-paid for one call. It was on record, the call was an collect call which AE will pay them again! I totally think this hotel is over-rated!

I agree - the sewage smell from the bathroom drains is not pleasant. We were on the top floor, so we could open the skylight in our bathroom, and this helped some. The bathroom was also TINY -- the \"shower\" was actually a hybrid bathtub in which one had to sit (not tall enough to stand, not long enough to lie down), and hold the shower hose over one's head to bathe! There is NO internet access in room at all. You have to pay 10 Euros an HOUR to use it in the lobby (try making Skype calls to your family from the lobby of a hotel!?!). Not happy about that. Our one real problem here was that we couldn't control the temperature in our room. It was hot (too hot to get under the covers and sleep), and they had switched the whole hotel over from A/C to heat the week before we arrived. Our only choice was to leave the outside window open all the time... and then listen to the church bells ringing ALL NIGHT. We didn't get a good night's sleep in Venice, ever, because of this. The staff was apologetic, but couldn't do anything about it. I understand the heating problem was a seasonal/temporary thing... but other hotels simply let you control the temp in your room independent of the rest of the building.

The service provided by the Alessandro the bellmen and Alessandro at the Front Desk was very good. Now for the bad. We were put in a handicapped room and we were not handicapped. This in itself is not a big deal, but the amount of black mold in the bathroom was disgusting. When I asked at the Front Desk (we actually were dealing with the GM) about being moved to another room, we were told that we were assigned that room because one of us had recently had some surgery. Neither my wife or I have had surgery recently. My mother-in-law had surgery recently and was NOT in a handicapped room which was fine by her. Anyway we were showed 2 other rooms to see if we would want to move to for the rest of our stay, they both had extensive amounts of mold in their bathrooms too so I told the GM that we would not want to move as none of the other rooms were any better and requested that he get the mold taken care of in our room. They probably got about 50% of it only!! The arrogance and rudeness towards us by the General Manager was shocking to me, I guess he leads by example with the exception of the 2 previously mentioned employees. The lady serving breakfast, the other FD staff and the other bellmen seemed to follow their GM's poor example. During one of our afternoon walks we stumbled across a wine shop where we got a nice bottle of wine to enjoy before dinner and when my father-in-law asked if they had a corkscrew that we could use to open the wine, he was given quite a hard time and was told that he would have to ask the bar tender who told him that he would be charged. Eventually a bellmen came to the room with a bottle opener. This is just another example of the overall poor service. The breakfast was not good, the choices were slim. We booked a gondola ride through the hotel directly (DON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE) and the price was significantly more than we could have got at any of the public areas. This was the only hotel out of the 6 hotels that we stayed in during our trip to Italy that we had to pay for the internet. There were no paper towels in the common area bathrooms to dry our hands with. The sheets on our bed were stained. We had to cover the drains in our bathroom to prevent the smell of sewer entering the room and I had to make a small barricade with towels to prevent water flooding the bathroom when we took a shower. All of these issues were brought up at some point to the staff during our trip and we didn't even get as much as an apology.

Staff distant and desk staff verging on cold - but they became very friendly when selling us an overpriced shared gondola trip on our last night. The hotel is somewhat claustrophobic i.e. there isn't anywhere to go other than your room or a tiny bar or lounge - but as we spent everyday doing as much as we could this wasn't important. However, our 12 year old daughter wasn't impressed with the lack of English speaking channels - 1 in total! Probably not the right choice for teenagers. Breakfast room no windows but very inventively frescoed, not enough tables for guests and very poor quality/choice of breakfast - most definitely on the mean/cheap side.

Just a short 5 minute walk from St. Mark's square, which is a blessing in Venice with luggage. It's easy to find. Breakfast was good, with bread, croissants, cereal, fruit, meats, cheese, yogurts and juices, as well as coffee or tea. It was all served with a smile and breakfast extends until 10:30 so you can sleep late. Also, eggs and other hot fare are available for a very reasonable additional charge (eggs cost 3.5 Euros).

The room was kept clean and the concierge was amazing. The hotel desk staff helped us out with restaurant recommendations (as we had a two year old and didn't want to go to a no-children type restaurant but still wanted top notch cuisine). On Valentines Day eve they organised a babysitter for us at the last minute so we could have a meal on our own. They organised water taxi transport for us where ever we wanted to go. This hotel is close to the St. Marco's square, a 5 minute walk to these cafe's restuarants, shops, and also little convenience type stores where we could stock up on bottled water, snacks etc. It felt like we were in the center of all the action/attractions going on for carnivale - but we were a stones throw away from our room if we wanted to retreat for a rest. My only annoyance was the movie channel - but hey you don't go to Venice to lounge around and watch movies. The same movie seemed to be on repeat for 3 - 4 days non-stop. A minor issue but sometimes it was too cold to go out with our two year old so in the room we rested. I read some reviews here that said water was an issue - not once did we have a problem with high water - and we had a stroller to struggle with too. In the square of course the water is quite high - requiring boots/plastic water bags over your boots but around the hotel we were fine. Venice is Venice as we all know and the water is an issue but thats all part of the experience. We really felt this hotel was perfect for a family who wanted to be close to it all - close enough if you need to get back to the room for a rest/toddler time. The staff were spot on with their recommendations for restaurants to suit us too - we had great meals/service without feeling like we shouldnt have brought our tantrum toddler with us into the restuarant - which made it very stress free. The beds were comfortable - as with most hotels in Europe they were single beds pushed together. We didn't have a room with a view over the canal but I would recommend one as its all part of the venetian experience. It was also nice having the bar/sitting room right near the door for the water taxi as you can have a drink/coffee while you wait for your taxi boat. It took about 20 mins for our water taxi to take us from the train station in Venice to our hotel, and it took about 35 mins for our water taxi to take us to the Venice Airport. The hotel does organise a day trip to Murano glass - obviously a deal between the two organistions, however the hotel will not pressure you to go. I think its worth the trip as you do get a great display of the glass blowing art and the museum/shop is worth a look too. Sure they put the hard sell on you - but if your confident and don't want to buy anything just say so - be blunt and polite and go outside and wait for the taxi to come and get you. We only brought two fish - small items as everything in there was very expensive - hard to find anything under $500 even for a tiny thing. We are very happy with what we got as (it shut the sales person up quickly) and also we have lovely lovely glass souveneir of our trip to the Murano Glass factory in Venice. You only live once and this was our only \"big\" buy in Venice. The staff at the Columbina were great - as we were only meant to stay 3 nights we ended up staying 6 - during the busiest time of the year for them.

The staff were very courteous and friendly, our room was charming if somewhat overheated (there is a thermostat so you can control the heating yourself) and the breakfast room (and breakfast) were delightful. Contrary to one review there is a lift although it does not go to the fifth floor (where there is only one room). One recent reviewer noted the difficulty of getting to the hotel when there is a high tide and, yes, water taxis can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to the hotel dock if the canal is flooded. However, it is actually very easy to get to (dry-shod) from the waterfront. From the airport: take the Alilaguna Blue Line (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac13pp; it takes 1hour 10minutes; turn left outside arrivals and follow the covered walkway to the docks for the Alilaguna and water taxis, it does take seven minutes).

Marco (the scenic route) or, quicker and dry underfoot if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a high tide (flooding at least part of the Piazza and requiring you to negotiate the narrow raised board walks: if the water is lapping onto the quay at S. Zaccaria then S. Marco is flooded). Cross the first two canals going towards S. Marco (turn left along the waterfront: each of the bridges has a gentle ramp) and take the narrow street (150m: Calle dei Albanese) on your right (if this is your first visit to Venice you will soon realise that Albanese is actually quite spacious!). (If you arrive at Zaccaria by vaporetta from the train station you cross just one bridge.)

Marco had arranged private water taxi's for all our guests and met us on his own time at the airport to insure that the transfer to the hotel went seamlessly. He personally put all our luggage on board the water taxi's making it a very pleasant experience for our guests. Our guests loved just walking off the water taxi and directly into the hotel. Hotel staff met each water taxi with warm smiles and an incredible welcome and manged getting all luggage marked and delivered to our rooms without any isses. All hotel reservations were completed by Marco prior to our arrival and room keys were handled in an expedient manner. Our rooms were very comfortable and beautifully arranged with lovely Venitian furniture, drapes and matching bed linens that you would expect in a 4 star hotel. Marco pre arranged private gondola rides for our guests in the latter part of the afternoon, followed by a great cocktail reception enjoyed by all in their lovely lobby area. Later that evening we all enjoyed an exceptional Venitian dinner with entertainment at one of the oldest Venice Restaurants within a five minute walk of the hotel again all personally arranged by Marco. In the morning we all enjoyed the lovely breakfast buffet prior to prearranged water taxis picking us up for a transfer to the ships terminal. I give the Hotel Columbina a 5+ review overall but would like to give Marco a special recognition for all he did to make our stay perfect in every way.

This is because there are 2 low bridges between the Grand Canal and the hotel's dock. If it is raining or, worse, if the streets are flooded and you must use the series of duck boards to get from St. Mark's to the Columbia, you should be aware that these temporary walkways are not continuous and you will have to take your luggage down from one set of boards and hoist up on to the next set of boards at 3-4 intersections. The board walkways are narrow and crowded with people. The elderly, handicapped and those with more than one bag will find this challenging. If your bags do not have wheels will be impossible to make this travel. Finally, when you do arrive near the hotel you will have to haul the bags up and then down a final bridge. Finally, several of the late afternoon evening staff exhibited an attitude of indifference to rudeness. I restate here the comment of another trip advisor reviewer who was more eloquent than I \"I found the reception that evening to be somewhat unfriendly and cool. Throughout our stay we received inconsistent attitudes from the reception desk, though they were mostly frosty and aloof throughout or visit. The bellhop, however, was very friendly and helpful.

I was immediately pleased by the Hotel's location. It is lierally diagonally right behind St. Mark's square...anyone who has 'complained' about lugging their luggage from the 'port' to the hotel is unrealisitic. We landed in Venice during high tide...the water was literally up to our chins and my husband had to lug our two huge suitcases on the narrow walking platforms that are erected during high tide. We tackled this and never once felt inconvenienced...as this is part of the 'adventure' when travelling. We stayed in room 405, which is a short flight up from the elevator. I was so impressed with the room...yes, the room is slightly small...but isn't everything in Europe? The cieling of our room was all wood with a post and beam pattern and we had a nice terrace overlooking all of Venice (you could see mountains to the North on a clear day) and the domes of St. Mark's and the Bridge of Sighs. I found the hotel to be a perfect location in terms of feeling as though you're in the 'bustle' of the city without it being too crowded....keep in mind we were there from October 22 - 25, so towards the end of tourist season. Some reviews have commented on the bathrooms and how they had to crouch down? I'm 5'10\" and although the shower/bathtub combination has an 'interesting' sit-down bench thingy...the main platform of the actual shower is plenty tall and I didn't need to adjust the height of the actual shower head. My husband and I didn't really use the services of the Hotel...so we can't really comment on the breakfast, internet service or stuff like that. But our room was always clean when we returned from our day and the hotel staff was friendly and always answered any question(s) we had.

The room we had was effectively an attic conversion and was a change from most hotel box rooms with the corner being walled off as the bathroom. The room had wooden beams and a nice bed ( which was turned down for you each evening with a card telling you what the weather would be like the following day!) plenty of mirrors and nice furniture with a plasma TV in the corner and the usual exorbitantly priced minibar and a safe which does not have to be paid for ( although ours was not in best working order and took several attempts to lock each time it was opened). Also there were no tea/coffee making facilities. There was also not much wardrobe space to hang up clothes However the bathroom really was of little use to anyone over F5'00 due to where it had been built within the hotel. The bath is the smallest one I'd ever seen and had a raised area to sit on and you could not stretch out your legs. Likewise you could not stand up in it either and a shower head attachment was provided for use as you sat in the bath. Equally if you stood at the washbasin you'd be unable to see your face in the mirror unless you crouched down or were under F5'00 tall. The room was on the 5th floor but the lift only went to the 4th and there was a short flight of steps to the room. It was climbing these stairs that you noticed it suddenly getting warmer and warmer and when you got into the room it was incredibly hot. Consequently you needed to turn on the air con. Incredibly this was not available as I was told that it was switched off as an energy saving measure in Winter which is all very commendable except when you try and sleep at night. In the end we had to leave the window open and when I woke up in the morning I had been bitten innumerable times by whatever insects had visited the room that night.

Breakfast consisted of cereals, breads, yogurt, meats, fruit, and coffee and tea to order. The hotel is about a 2 minute walk to St. Mark's Square, and about 10 minutes to the Realto Bridge. The hotel website accurately says you can see the Bridge of Sighs, but the bridge is currently being renovated so it's covered. Upon checkin they offered us the chance to join a group gondola tour at roughly 1/2 price (we passed) and a free trip to the glass museum on Murano (which we did). The water taxi picked us up right at the hotel, which has it's own \"dock\". The staff was what you'd expect at a 4 star hotel - a little stuffy, but very nice - and they spoke English quite well.

Quite frankly, this visit was even better than our previous visit. Our room was large (we had 4 in our room with no problem) and beautifully decorated; the continental breakfast was excellent, the hotel stafff were pleasant, and the location of the hotel was both right in the heart of the activity, while at the same time being enough off of the beaten path to be quiet and peaceful at night. The jewel of Colombina Hotel is Concerierge Marco, who treated us as though we were the hotel's most important guests. Concerierge Marco went beyond the call of duty to make sure that our family enjoyed our stay, which are best illustrated by three examples. Our first night in Venice, we were searching for a new restaurant at which to dine, and asked Concerierge Marco for advice. He recommended one of his favorite restaurants for dinner and then called to get us a reservarion. We found out later from the owner of the restaurant that they were already filled for the night - but they fit us in, immediately seated us, treated us like honored guests, and served us the best meal that we had in Venice. Concerierge Marco made all of the arrangements for a driver to take our family to my wife's ancestrial home, Dolmeggi, located 2.5 hours north of Venice. The driver that Marco selected was waiting for us at the pre-arranged pick-up point, was friendly, patient and courteous, and made the entire excersion the best part of our vacation. The day that we left Venice, we had an 7:20 am train. My children were not happy to learn that we would need to get up quite early to catch the public water taxi service from St. Mark's Square to the train station. Marco heard of this and arranged to have a private water taxi pick us up at the hotel and take us to the train station at close to the same cost that the public water taxi service alone would have cost. This allowed my children to sleep in for almost an extra hour, which made the rest of the day that much more pleasant for all. We could not be more satisified with the hotel and will (and already have) recommend the Colombina Hotel to anyone visiting Venice. In addition, we commend Concerierge Marco and believe that his extraordinary efforts resulted in our family's enjoyment of our trip to Venice.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cTop Hotel with the BEST staff, location and room amenities\u201d", "Author": "missy_ttsp", "ReviewID": "UR31249675", "Content": "We arrived in Venice for our honeymoon.

The hotel room was the most awe inspiring with the largest murano glass chandelier we ever saw mounted on a high ceiling. I strongly recommend you to get a room with a view of the bridge of sighs, we didn't know it would be also a balcony with a stunning view overlooking it! As we sat in the room, we heard gondoliers singing and playing accordions and/or guitars serenading us from below! It was otherwise quiet outside, so no worries about boat/crowd noise. The bathroom was all marble with tub and shower, including bidet, heavenly! A 5 minute leisurely walk to Basilico di San Marco from the hotel made it even more enticing.

The best thing about the room, however, was that it included you own private 15 foot by 15 foot roof top deck which you access up a short ladder and out a small door. The deck had a couple of lounge chairs and a table with chairs and a sun/rain shade. It had great views of the rooftops of Venice.

The hotel rooms are comparable, though my room at Locanda Remedio was much larger than my room at Hotel Columbina. Please see Hotel Columbina for my opinions of that room. Locanda Remedio is centrally located - a few minutes walk to Piazza San Marco, close to restaurants and shops. Really, it is ideally located. The hotel is very quiet, yet within easy reach of the sights. Hotel Columbina is also directly on the canal (and Locanda Remedio is connected via courtyard to Hotel Columbina). This is convenient if you decide to take a taxi anywhere. Water taxis are, by the way, not for the budget traveler. They are, however, incredibly convenient when traveling with a young child. I used the water taxi to get to our car rental agency after our stay in Venice. I arrived in Venice late one night after several hours of delays. The town was absolutely quiet and I felt like I was wandering around on an empty film set. I got off the vaporetto at S. Marco and had no trouble finding the hotel. There are many little winding walkways in Venice, but even my 3-year-old was able to lead me around and find his way back to our hotel after an outing. You'll be able to find the hotel without much trouble with a decent map and halfway decent sense of direction. Our room at Locanda Remedio was decorated in the typical Venetian opulence one might expect. This would be a lovely place for a honeymoon. I was traveling alone with my small son and found the hotel worked very well for us, too. The room itself was the largest room I've ever had in Europe. It overlooked the courtyard shared with Hotel Columbina. We had a bed, couch and other furniture, yet plenty of open floor space. The closet area was large, as was the bathroom. This hotel was immaculately clean and beautifully decorated. The bed was also comfortable. In the morning, we would have breakfast just outside of our room at the Locanda Remedio. The breakfast was a perfect continental breakfast with coffee service and really wonderful staff. Having breakfast on site was included in our room rate, but also incredibly convenient...especially with a small child. I should note, though, that I saw very few tourists with small children in Venice. Mostly, couples on honeymoons, I think. On a whole, Venice is one of the least friendly cities I've visited in Europe. I think the oppressive level of tourism accounts for this. Although Venice has many fantastic sites, it is a tourist trap. The street vendors are forceful and would readily take advantage of the fact that I was traveling with a child. Some went beyond obnoxious and straight to hostile when I refused to buy their junk. And, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re selling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c junk. I am a well-seasoned traveler and have no trouble handling these types of people, but their level of uncompromising aggression was surprising. The great dichotomy in Venice was in the way I was treated. The locals were either a bit too friendly or just a touch unfriendly (some were even downright rude). I was either being hit on (I was asked out several times, despite the fact that I was clearly traveling with a small child) or being met with coldness and disdain. I would not say that there was no middle ground, but I was a bit stunned at how few \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd interactions I had with Venetians. The hotel staff are helpful and kind, though sometimes I thought the men at the front desk were a little cool. They were not unfriendly, nor were they gracious. The bellman was incredibly pleasant and helpful. Overall, I highly recommend the hotel for a stay in Venice.

We arrived from Milan on the train and, being unfamiliar with Venice, elected to take a water taxi from the train station direct to the hotel (cost 75 EURO). Well worth the extra cost, as we would surely have had difficulty finding the hotel from Piazza San Marco being unfamiliar with the area. Upon arrival, we were greeted at the door, helped from the taxi and ushered to the front desk. We checked into room 407, one of three 'loft' rooms (405-407) accessed by stairs from the 4th floor. We affectionately refer to this room as the 'treehouse'. With slanted ceilings and exposed beams in both the bedroom and bath, one full window in a corner alcove of the bedroom and a skylight window in the bathroom, this room felt like our own private treehouse retreat. The room was tastefully well appointed with queen size bed, closet with personal safe, and minibar. The bathroom was marble and granite and equipped with hairdryer, bath & shampoo accessories, bath slippers. Adding to the treehouse adventure of this room, was a small two-level 'soak tub' and handheld shower, as the slanted ceilings in the bathroom prevented a standup shower. In the lobby of the Columbina is a nice 'sitting room' and small bar area (the bartenders were great). Breakfast is served in two rooms off the lobby -the breakfast buffet consisted of cereal, fresh fruit, breads & pastries, yogurt, meat and cheeses, juices, coffee and tea. Prepared eggs are available for an additional charge. The staff were very helpful, booking both the Grand Canal Tour and a Gondola ride for us.

The gondola ride was lovely, but note that if you book through the hotel, you may be sharing the gondola with other guests.

Out the back door across a dingy courtyard into the abandon lobby of the Locanda Remedio Hotel. Old dusty desk still in place. All of the Locanda Remedio signs still up. Boxes of toilet paper and other room stuff lined against the wall. Up the shabby stairs with worn out carpet into a shabby common room.

The other room was up a narrow staircase and had a very low ceiling, inadequate air ventilation and a ratty bathroom. It just didn't feel right. This wasn't the canal side \"view of the Bridge of Sighs from your room\" property that we had anticipated. My guess is that this property had failed and the Columbina picked it up for overflow or discount website guests, both of which categories we probably fit. It needs some serious capital investment.

The next morning breakfast was great actually. I went back to the desk and asked Mr. Diori (Manager) about a possible change and the guy was downright mean. No way, no way , no way. No room in the \"main\" hotel. Ugh! At that point I moved on and enjoyed Venice. But, I just felt re-traded at the Columbina.

Within minutes walk of St Marks Square it is impossible to get lost and also very handy to explore the delights of Venice. The breakfast was extremely enjoyable and the service very consistent. However, perhaps wedding parties are the norm in Venice as the staff did not show any interest or excitement on our big day- even our Venetian based wedding co-ordinator commented on the lack of enthusiasm. Despite this we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and if you are looking for a well placed central hotel providing good service and a high standard of accomodation for a reasonable price then look no further.", "Date": "July 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel in wonderful Venice\u201d", "Author": "EmmaRomy", "ReviewID": "UR8061203", "Content": "Have just returned from an amazing time in Venice and the Hotel Colombina was perfect.

There was also a good hairdryer that worked! The windows opened out onto a private courtyard.

Locanda was an annex of Hotel Columbina & the concierge was in the main hotel which was also very classy.

We took the expensive water taxi to the hotel and were glad to have done so, as it was getting dark and we had no confidence of navigating the tiny streets with our luggage. The taxi driver said that the tide was too low to get to the hotel, wanted to dump us at St Marc's square - which would have meant we wasted a lot of money. After unhappy noises from us, he decided to try to get through after all. When we reached the hotel dock, the porter whisked our bags away and showed us to our room on the first floor. It was ok, but smelled strongly of smoke although it was a non-smoking room. They moved us to a different room on the same floor, but on the corner with windows on two sides. It was much bigger, split level, with a split-level bathroom as well clad completely in marble. The bed was extremely hard - anyone expecting American-style pillow-top beds is in for a shock. The unseasonably warm weather also made the room stuffy, and there was no a/c and it was too noisy to sleep with the windows open. These factors in no way spoiled our stay, and we are picky travelers. The breakfast was fine, continental style. The reception staff were fantastic - instantly booked us on the free trip to Murano where we toured a glassworks. (Be prepared for rather high-pressure sales tactics from the showroom staff.) We came back in the afternoon in time for the gondola ride, also organised by the hotel. We shared with another couple, for only 25 euros each. It's such a cliche, but I would recommend it to anyone as an experience. The reception staff also sent us to a different local restaurant each night: Carletto, Il Conte Pescaor, and Giardinetto. The first 2 were very enjoyable, but the last was not. They gave us an English-only menu (always a bad sign). I was persuaded to try the Bangoli, a local pasta dish of brown spaghetti with an onion/anchovy sauce. It was vile, I managed to eat 2 bites only and they didn't take it off the bill. The amaretti tiramisu almost made up for it, but not quite. Like another reviewer, we managed to forget some belongings in our hotel room when we left.

While it is near to St. Marks, it is tucked away in its own quiet recess. The lobby and breakfast room were handsomely appointed. The service in the breakfast room and the small bar were just right: attentive without being intrusive. There is a reading room with internet access. Our small disappointments: we were put in the \"annex,\" which is behind the Colombina and across a small courtyard. It was another hotel formerly that, I assume, has been acquired by the Colombina. It is also very pleasant, but it does not have any rooms with a view onto the canal. Our dining room was, if anything, even grander or more pleasant than the one in the Colombina \"proper.\" Our room was on the first floor. It was handsomely furnished, with exposed beams and upholstered walls of damask. The bath was black and white marble. While it had a nice vanity, the shower was close to being so small that I wondered how anyone large than myself could fit into it!

The hotel apparently has video cameras everywhere and threatened to call the police if he did not leave. We asked them to help him to find the hotel but they told us that that was not their job and as far as they were concerned he could get lost in Venice.

The rooms were comfortable and quaint without being over the top ornate, with clean towels every day and it certainly looked like clean linen every day. We never had to ask for water in our room or for them to restock the mini bar it was done without fail. We had a room on the 1st floor whilst the children on the top, both rooms were very quiet and people were very considerate when returning to the hotel late or the sound proofing was extra good. One piece of advice, if you opt for a water taxi ask them to take you direct to your hotel as most drop off at St Marks Square and it is a maze of alleys. We took a water taxi who dropped us off at the door of our hotel which took about 35 mins and cost Euros 85 for 4 people. The same people on our flight took another taxi who dropped them off at St Marks Square and it took them about 2 hours to locate the hotel.

It goes without saying that the city is the most beautfiul city I have ever visited but it was made truly more memorable by a lovely hotel in a great location. Just a 5 minute stroll from St Marks and a further 7 or 8 minutes to the Rialto it is in a great spot and nothing was too much trouble for the hotel staff. Right from the start they were friendly and warm and although not a big hotel (32 rooms I think) the staff were immaculate in there dress and they are always there when you wanted something. There is no hanging about for a tip when they do something for you, if you wish to tip them they are very grateful but they are quick to depart from what ever they are doing and get back to there duties. The friendly nature of barman Roberto was a highlight as he was always there to fill a glass or making some little snacks to pass to you whilst you had your drink. Rooms were good and comfortable and always cleaned nicely the following morning, whilst not perhaps 5 star rooms they were certainly worthy of a 4 star and with its own landing jetty (all be it a small one) arriving by Water Taxi from the Airport (even at 105 euros) is a must. Breakfast room is lovely and the decoration really classy, breakfast was very good for us but some may find it perhaps a little limited depending on your taste bjut with Croissants and cereals and cake plus ham and cheeses it had all we wanted. The desk staff are always happy to recommend things and even after checking out and waiting for our Water Taxi back to the airport they kept us updated with the Taxi's progress as it was 10 minutes late arriving due to the amount of traffic on the Canal.

We stayed four nights and had a really good time. The staff were very friendly. The location was perfect, the Bridge of Sighs was visible from our room and St Marks Square is just a short stroll. Our room which was very clean and comfortable, had a canal view and the sights and sounds of Venice coming to life in the mornings was just wonderful. Our only problem was the bed, we do like a good firm bed but this one was incredibly hard, anyway who wants to sleep in Venice there is so much to see! We were warned by our travel rep on arrival about hotel staff offering FREE trips to Murano to see the glass blowing. She said we should not accept under any circumstances because of the very high pressured selling techniques involved and reading other reviews we are glad we resisted. We did get the impression it happened at many hotels not just the Colombina! Anyway, we decided we really didn't need to go to Murano, as we thought they couldn't have all that much left on the island judging by the vast quantity available in nearly EVERY shop in Venice! I would be happy not to see any more for a very long time. We bought a 72 hour Vaporetti (Water Bus) ticket for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 each which was extremely good value as it was a great way of getting around. Buy the ticket at a vaporetti stop, validate it in the machine and that's it, you can go anywhere at any time. It can be ckecked from often to not at all whilst travelling so just keep it handy. Ours were 'checked' only once during all of our trips. To sum up, it was a great hotel to spend four nights and we were not disappointed, just don't sign up for the trips!

We found this to be true also in our three night stay there. Our room faced the canal and was elegant and spotlessly clean. I thought the best part of Venice was waking to the bells of the Campanile San Marco and the sounds of the water taxis and barges bringing supplies to the businesses along the canal. To the left from our windows was a view of the Bridge of Sighs. At night the sound of the gondolas, some with accordions and singers, was the perfect ending of the day. I should also mention that closing the shutters and the windows resulted in almost total quiet if one desired it. We found the service to be excellent from the porters who assisted with our luggage to the barman who placed a chilled bottle of Prosecco and glasses into our gondola. The concierge recommendation of a small restaurant nearby--Ristorante da Carletto--resulted in a perfect meal on our first night in Venice. I would highly recommend this wonderful little place and especially its superlative grilled fish! The breakfast included in the room rate was exceptionally good and in a very attractive room. Plenty of choices for all tastes. The caffe latte was wonderful as was the cappuchino. I have only one warning about this hotel. When checking in, the concierge recommended a free trip to Murano --one he said would be limited to ten guests of the hotel. We would be picked up at the hotel dock and taken by water taxi to Murano where we would see a glass blowing demonstration and the glass museum. We signed on for this. My husband and I and another couple we were traveling with were taken to Murano the next morning. It turned out we were being \"taken\" in more than one way! BEWARE FREE TRIPS TO MURANO! We went to the Signoretti Factory where we did indeed see some glass blowing for about 20 minutes. We were then taken upstairs for a VERY high pressure sales pitch. Both couples ended up spending a great deal of money after which we were taken back to Venice in another boat owned by Signoretti and deposited somewhere on the island to find our way back to the Columbina. The boatman stopped at a dock and announced, \"All out\". Lost in Venice for more than an hour, we finally found our way back to the hotel. Complaints to the desk resulted in a free bottle of Prosecco for the four of us but in no way took away the sense of \"being had\". One hotel employee told us that the hotel owners are related to the Signorettis. Whatever the truth of the matter, we wish we had been more leary of this \"opportunity\". I also wish I had read some of the reviews on the Internet about this glass maker before making the purchases we made. When the shipment of glass we purchased arrives in five weeks, we fervently hope to feel better about this experience! With that one exception, we felt the the hotel did a wonderful job.

Venice is expensive. Accept this fact, relax and you will love this unique city. This was our first visit to Venice. The Hotel Colombina is ideally placed being just a few minutes walk from San Marco square. Like many hotels in Venice it is small. It does not have its own restaurant, but frankly with so many places to eat within a short distance this is not an issue. Our room, as requested, overlooked the canal. Of good size, it had very high ceilings, fabric covered walls, and good quality, traditional style furnishings. The marble bathroom was of decent size and well equipped. Breakfast, in a delightfully decorated Breakfast Room consisted of a perfectly good cold buffet which included juice, yoghurts, sliced cheese, ham and various plain rolls and sweet rolls. Oh and the coffee, as usual in Italy, was excellent. Staff were professional and helpful, if not quite as outgoing and friendly as their Southeren countrymen. Yes, they did on the odd occassion try and push visits to the local Glass Factory, or Gondola trips, but a polite, and firm 'no thank you' was met with good grace. Our only complaint was one morning when everyone seemed to have got up at the same time the hot water system struggled to cope with the demand. We travelled from the Airport to San Marco by water-bus. This is slow, but cheap, it can be a bit crowded and noisy, but as it makes about 5-6 stops at the various smaller islands it is a good way to see some surrounding area to the main island. On our return to the Airport we got a water-taxi (speedboat) from the hotel's own landing stage. It was expensive, but great fun and an ideal way to end a visit.
