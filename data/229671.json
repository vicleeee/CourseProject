Hotel staff was mostly friendly. There were some confusion/debate over the room rate but it was resolved eventually.

Breakfast (NOT included in the room rate) was very expensive, overpriced at 14 euros per person for just a couple of breads, 2 types of cheese and boiled eggs. I booked a room for 3 people and got a very big and spacious room in the ground floor. My first concern with this room was the big sky window that didn't have any curtains. Surprisingly, this was the smallest problem of the room. This room was right across the room from the elevator, so people stopped to chat while waiting for the elevator all night long, making it impossible for me to get any sleep. The other problem is that this room was adapted for disabled people (which we weren't), so it had a shower with no curtains and a bath with no shower. Next day we asked to be transferred to another room. The new room was on the first floor, and much smaller, although we paid the same price. Again, it was very beautiful and well decorated. Bathroom was nicer, it had a closed shower, although it didn't have a bath. But it barely fitted the extra-bed (we were in 3 people) and it was conjugated to another room, so we could hear every single word they said in the next room. Of course it didn't help they were very loud Italians with a small baby that cried most of the time. Location, as I said, was good, but not great. It's very well and centrally located between Luxembourg Garden and Sorbonne University, Notre Damme Cathedral, but the nearest subway station was about 3-4 blocks away. I know it doesn't sound bad, but I've stayed in other cheaper hotels in Paris where you had a subway station just around the corner, so this one was a little disappointing.

The hotel is in a fantastic location near the Luxembourg Gardens and the Boulevard St. Michel, near metro stops, and in walking distance of attractions such as Notre Dame. It has been beautifully renovated- our room was very pretty and our bathroom was impressively large for a European hotel. The hotel does offer breakfast but its rather expensive and not anything special. There are tons of cafes and patisseries nearby to try instead. The staff was helpful at calling for dinner reservations for us. Our favorite place for dinner was Au Pere Louis just steps from the hotel. Also, there is a nice convenience store right across the street for snacks and water. We would happily stay here again!", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth Western Australia", "Title": "\u201cEverything we wished for and more!!\u201d", "Author": "mytimenow", "ReviewID": "UR81933633", "Content": "If you choose to stay at this lovely hotel you will not be disappointed.

Bed was bit hard for my liking but my partner disagreed and loved the bed. Crisp white linens to sleep under and very comfortable pillows which were a delight after other places this trip! The bathroom was lovely, an enormous bath that fitted us both with lovely clean tiles and nice toilettries. Little grocery shop directly over the road, pastry shop around the corner, excellent little wine bar on the corner up the top of the street - very sophisticated and not noisy! Fabulous restaurant right next door that we ate at - hardly any tourists and the food was beautiful French flavours and reasonably priced - 3 courses 2 persons plus drinks under 135 Euros. The staff were always helpful and very polite. The room was the basic double and it was an excellent size - big enough for us not to trip over our 2 large suitcases and the bathroom was enormous by European standards! Rooms were cleaned and in very good condition with what appears to be a very new refurbishment. We loved our stay and will definitely return next visit! Cannot recommend highly enough - we walked everywhere and could get home in a flash on the metro. Plus the free wifi was a bonus and not at all difficult to use in your rooms!

We loved the location and the staff were quite nice to me when I spoke french to them but not nearly as friendly to my partner who only speaks english. We stayed in a Junior Suite which while large seems to share a small corridor with the room the maid uses to clean all the rooms on the floor. This is quite unfortunate as to access the corridor you have to open a door which closes quite loudly and then to go into the housekeepers room there is another door which closes loudly as well. This all started about 8:30 every morning and never failed to wake us up and keep waking us up. It also sounded as if someone was trying to come into our room because the closing of those doors would shake our door as if someone was trying to get in. The elevator is also TINY - you can fit one person and 1 piece of luggage in it -- we just took the stairs but to get the bags in and out of the room we had to take a few trips. The rooms are quite basic, even the Junior Suites don't have a mini-refrigerator. There is a bar size refrigerator in the kitchen downstairs which guests have access to along with plates, cutlery, glasses, wine bottle openers, etc. We really liked this neighborhood. There were lots of restaurants very close by, the Jardin de Luxembourg was across the street and you could walk to all the sites from here. Having such a large landmark close by made it easy to get back if we ever took a taxi.
