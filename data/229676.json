You walk out the front door and are virtually at the event start/finish! Being in Place Espagna is a pretty good spot for the rest of barcelona also as it is a great city for walking around in. Having said that, it is a fair walking distance to places such as Las Ramblas, the port/beach area, Segrada di Familia, etc. fortunately we had great weather so it was excellent for all the walking! Easay to also get taxis or the metro. The hotel itself was fine - we had a renovated room on the 3rd floor with reasonable view of place espagna. \"Wood\" flooring, suficient space, good bathroom, double bed not the best but still ok. Housekeeping was very good. Two things that were not great was firstly the lack of AC which meant the rooms were really hot (seriously ridiculous, felt like the heating was on!!) - prolem also being that it was essential to open the window which made it incredibly noisy. Second issue which was not as bad as the first was that the hotel has free wifi (which is very good, thank you!), however, it does not always work and we had one full day where it did not work at all. Staff were all really friendly except one woman in reception who was surprisingly rude compared to all the other very helpful and polite staff. Easy to get to/from airport - we got taxis both ways (about 16 euro each trip), the airport bus also apparently stops close to the hotel. Would definitely recommend this hotel if in Barcelona for the marathon and also fine even if just there on holiday (it does have a pool on the roof which was closed when we stayed there but this would be a bonus in the summer!).

I'd booked a Premium room which was a standard room which was refurbished and had some extras like tea / coffee making facilities, water, biscuits, dressing gown and slippers. When we checked in non of these were in the room. I informed reception and said that it was okay as we were popping out they could sort in the meantime. Two hours later, returned and nothing could be done. The girl I had asked before, let's call her sullen Melanie, refused to talk to me and a chap politely said he wold sort it, he'd have to tell house keeping. I asked if they hadnt already been told, why would they be? Because I spoke to you two hours ago.... Okay... It would've fixed immediately. Meantime in the room, the airconditioning only blows out warm air so now ( the claim here is that they turn off the airconditioning facility in winter). The advertised soundproofing is now pointless as we have to have the windows open. Firstly, the dressing gowns turn up.... Looking good.. Then the water and cookies turn up... Hopeful. Then a kettle turns up with one sachet of coffee and one tea bag... No milk... Back to reception... Ten minutes later I have two sachets of coffeeno milk. If I want to have milk I have to ring room service... Anyway, went out for the evening, sweated our way through the night and the next day went into the city.

There are good and bad things to say about it: Good: - location is ideal, a metro station just outside main entrance, Aerobus station a stone's throw away - rooms with view of Plaza Espana is splendid - wifi available, very good - i like the hard bed - there is a mall beside which has many restaurants/cafes (but not much fashion stores) - there are lots of convenience stores within walking distance so easy to buy bottled water and other necessities - lots of pharmacies within the area, too - food in hotel restaurant can be good if you order the right dish - three ladies in Reception excel in their job (Noela, Linda and Lucy). They are friendly and service-minded. - convention group very efficient esp Gina and Miguel - Julio of snack bar/restaurant very service-oriented and friendly - one of the best breakfast omelettes i have tasted esp when made by the filipina lady Bad: - I saw a cockroach in my bathroom - rooms are quite dated, as other reviewers mentioned - no aircon, i had to sleep with window open, which of course is noisy because it is in a busy part of the city - very long queues in the breakfast area (often very crowded) - in my 9-day stay, i only saw 1 bell boy. so if you are in a hurry to get your bags down, it will be better to drag it along with you by yourself. - no boiling kettle in the room (when I was badly in need of hot water in thermos, I needed to beg room service). in fact, in 3 out of 6 requests, no thermos came. - one reception staff by the name of Sara treated me like a fool when I asked for help in asking the staff for hot water. I was completely voiceless and wrote in front of her my request, she replied to me \"this is the reception, we don't have hot water here\". i was really surprised at the daffness that she did not realise that if i had voice, i would have ordered room service instead. why would i go down the room just to ask for help in reception? her colleagues have been helping me days before and she was the only one who did not only refuse to help but even replied to me like i'm stupid. she holds the record as being the most rude reception staff i have ever met and boy, i have met so many receptionists in my trips. overall, i think it deserves to be a 3-star hotel. will i stay there again? if i have limited budget, i will. but with all the internet sites nowadays, i think i can get a better quality hotel for same price we had (75EUR/night, rate for a conference group). if i am forced to because it is the official hotel for the conference, i can live with it. it is not that horrible, but definitely not positively memorable either.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cGreat view over Plaza Espana\u201d", "Author": "jogarna", "ReviewID": "UR120868000", "Content": "Very nice hotel perfectly located in Plaza de Espana.

I explained that there was no point changing rooms if the bed was the same but it seems that he had a problem understanding this and got pretty rude with me. He then spoke to his manager and suddenly a new mattress appeared at our room. As the old one left the room I noticed a huge big hole at the corner of it, as if mice had eaten through it. It was also old, badly stained and had this hole. There was also mold on the bathroom wall, all this astonished us considering that this was being advertised as a four star hotel like (pictures attached to prove it). The new mattress that was brought into our room was the same as the old one, hard as rock. So, again I went down to the desk and asked to speak to the manager. We explained that the hotel either give us our money back or else upgrade us. So, in the end they upgraded us to a private suite on the top floor, which I think would cost around $400/$500 a night in other real four star hotels, but this one again had the same hard bed, the furniture was from the seventies era and had a broken chair. By then we were both tired and pissed off so we decided to stay put. The next day, Sunday, at 9.00 am we woke up to a racket that came from above our room. We soon discovered that he room above us was rented out as a church. They had their mics turned full to an unbearing sound. At first I asked politely for them to turn this annoying racket down but they just ignored me and so we called the front desk to complain but it persisted and that is when we packed our bags and decided to leave.

He then spent 2 hours (approximately) fixing the wardrobe and the socket. I phoned down to reception to ask for someone to clean the was basin. No-one appeared. 20 minutes later I went down to reception to ask for a cleaner. I was told that the cleaner would not come immediately and, in any case, why was I in such a hurry? I explained that the disgusting black gunge that had swirled round the basin was a health hazard and that I wanted the basin disinfected. Cleanliness and hygiene do not appear to be a priority at this hotel, althogh the cleaner did eventually appear and was finally persuaded to apply what appeared to be disinfectant.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Skopje, Republic of Macedonia", "Title": "\u201cEcxellent\u201d", "Author": "Dobrinka B", "ReviewID": "UR119265890", "Content": "I have been in this wonderful hotel during 4 days and I like it very much!

These included: bottle of water & oreo cookies free, tea and coffee making facilities apart from other services. On reaching the hotel there was no one to help with the bags as I got off the taxi in front of the hotel entrance, the reception lady took the entire payment right at the time of check in through my credit card. Asked me to wait fve minutes for the only single bell bot that they have. On reaching room the aircondition was not working, there was no water bottle nor cookies, nor any tea coffee making facilities. Repeatedly I had to call reception, there is no 'house keeping number to call' the 'room service' lady who answers your phone does not understnd english. After a long while a mechanic came who after some tinkering was able to start the airconditioning but said temperature control has gone bad and will not work. On knowing this as it would make the room too cold if the temperature thermostat does not work, I again asked the reception, which offered to change my room but to one which did not have the plaza view, as I had laready unpacked all my stuff, and as I had a conference to attend, I asked if I continue in this room will they get the thermostat repaired or replaced the next day, and they said yes they would do so positively the next day when i am out of the room. All these things wasted so much of my time that I just couldn't go for the conference on this day. Nothing was done about the temperature control the next day or even the day after, every night I am freezing to death till I wake up in the middle of the night to shut the aircondition off. The recption is again reminded but seems totally unconcerned. To my amazement the reception refused to agree to the fact that they had to provide tea coffee making tray in the room as is clearly mentioned on their booking website ( you can check: http://www.hoteles-catalonia.com/en/our_hotels/europa/spain/catalunya/barcelona/hotel_catalonia_barcelona_plaza/index.jsp?cmp=tcm:42-4948&seccion=habitaciones ). On repeated argument after a long time the man on the reception said, that yes it was mentioned on the website but it was wrong!!!! but still they will send the tea making tray and that they send the water and cookies after the client arrives. Well I took it to be settled. To my amazement the next day my room was cleaned but no water bottle or cookies were replaced. I asked the recption (they are the only ones who speak english) they said call room service and therafter a water bottle came, cookies were still no where to be seen. When I searched in the tea coffee tray there was no milk powder satchet or liquid, on calling room service again they brought milk in a milk dispenser!! (without cover). I was very surprised at the standard of service. In any case I could not keep that milk for long and so I decided to have tea without milk!!. Today is the third day I am at this hotel, today when I came back from the conference, to my utter surprise I find no water bottle or cookies replaced and the tea coffee tray gone!! On asking the recption says tea coffee facility was only for the first day (which is not true, their website says and we all know that tea coffee making facilities are not a 'welcome drink' but a continuous facility in the room for which we are paying superior room charges every day!). On the first night I reaqlised I had forgotten mthe electrical adapter for plugging in my laptop as the plug system here is different from my own country, I was asked to come down to reception, I waited for an hour at the recpetion without anybody helping and fianlly had to go and search for it outside, which I did with great difficulty as I dont speak spanish. I am amazed at how easily the hotel staff speaks whatever it likes, and is cheeky enough to dupe clients, is the management not concerned and just allowing all this to go on and on. I have emailed to their central office, but am quite shocked & surpirised with all this. Also note the minibar cupboard cover is broken and hangs, bathroom door gets stuck on the floor and doesn't open fully, wardrobe doors are stuck and are very difficult to move.

The Internet connection was for free, but was at times unstable. The downsides was the training room. It consisted only of a bike, a threadmill and a leg extension and chest machine. No barbells nor dumbells. Moreover, I found the hotel a bit \"unpersonal\" - the lobby is so big you will never get to say hello to the receptionist. The dining room is so large you usually also avoid all contact with the staff. No chatting or talking to the staff - so many persons were working there that I found this impossible. Maybe this is what most business people ask for - not to be bothered - but personally I prefer a smaller hotel where I can chat a bit with the locals and maybe get some tip on where to go and what to see. The hotel is built so that all gets down to strictly business. The last thing that annoyed me was that you had to pay $5 per night to keep a hotel safe.

Go in expecting this, but here is an addendum: The rooms were clean, and the AC worked, the internet free. The metro station was right in front of the hotel and ideally 2 stops away from las Ramblas. I(n retrospect, I'm glad I didn't stay right on las Rambas.-too busy!) If you ask for a view of the Plaza, you get a great view of the lit up 1930's National Palace and convention center and the magic fountains. (This is just a walk away uphill and I highly recommend the view from the top wherever you stay, and the lit magic fountains on the weekend.) I spent a lot of time looking out my window. If you are a convention attendee, this location is ideal- a walk away. I enjoyed the breakfast. Since I expected the staff to be rude, they were helpful, but not in a way that maybe those who are used to being kissed up to in travel would expect, but from what I have read, Barcelona isn't a kiss-butt kinda town. Didn't look at the pool- too much to see. We did have a choice of where to stay our last four days, and were content to stay there because of the conveneince of the metro.

Our room on the 6th floor was neat, clean and a decent size with a pleasant view toward the Parc de Montjiuc and the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (particularly spectacular when lit up at night!). On the negative side ... firstly, the air conditioning in our room did not work and then the next morning we found that the shower also was not working. We reported these problems to reception and were told that they would have to call in an engineer - why they don't have a tradesman on site to deal with these type of problems, I don't know. We returned that evening to find that the shower was now working and had apparently been repaired but the air conditioning was still dead. Reception were no help. We had to revert to opening and closing the window to regulate the temperature (and the noise from the traffic below) in the room. The air-conditioning had not been repaired by the time we left three days later, and we received no acknowledgment or apology for the inconvenience at check-out. A cheeseburger meal ordered from room service also failed to impress. The cheeseburger was dry and overcooked and the \"chips\" were packet crisps, not cooked chips/fries as you might expect when ordering a hot meal. The pool/roof area has been neglected and is in need of some repair and renovation - it is certainly no longer of the standard shown in the picture/s on the hotel's website. As noted in an earlier review, you have to pay for any \"extras\" such as wi-fi and the in-room safe. These items and others things such as an iron/ironing board are included as standard in many good hotels. Common with other European hotels, there were also no tea/coffee making facilities in the room.

Negative - Staff, though friendly, didn`t seem particularly well-trained. e.g. my colleague had to struggle to explain to the breakfast staff what decaff coffee is. The staff member on reception didn`t know where one of the main conference centres was. That kind of thing. You just expect better from a 4 star hotel. Colleagues of mine ringing the hotel rang me several times on my mobile because they did not get any reply from the switchboard (!) The second big negative is the equipment. They seem to have one iron for the whole building. When I finally got it, they told me there was no ironing board. My female colleague ask for a replacement hair drier to be sent up and specifically NOT a maintenance man but still she got the maintenance man which is not what she wanted at 7am in her underwear. Maybe it is just the language barrier and they say they understand but do not. I don`t konw. They also have a problem with the heating - it was almost impossible to turn off.
