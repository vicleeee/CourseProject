The staff at the front desk was happy to give me directions in the morning to where I was going. When we came to the Hotel in the evenings, there was always a friendly greeting. You feel like the staff knows your name at Elan Hotel. The maid staff was excellent and friendly.

I have stayed two blocks west at the Sofitel and paid almost twice as much. I have also stayed up on Sunset at the London West Hollywood and paid well over $340/night. The rooms are comparable to these pricey hotels. I had an Executive King and found it well decorated with crisp sheets and large, fluffy towels, a robe, slippers, coffee pot, mini bar and a great flat screen TV. The room was quiet and very clean. The location is undeniably great - two blocks to the Beverly Center, about six blocks to the Grove and there is an amazing number of good local restaurants within walking distance - try the Kings Road Cafe for a fabulous latte and delicious breakfast or Swinger's Diner for just about anything. All in all, a great value. I only had the complimentary breakfast once as it was typical cereal, bland muffins, bagels, juice, coffee. The wine reception was the only thing I can honestly say was not good. They served only two choices of wine, a Cabernet Sauvignon and a Sauvignon Blanc. Both were brands you'd find in the lowest shelf at your local grocery store - really bad stuff. The crackers and cheese were rather skimpy. But, hey, it was free. The reason you pay big bucks for the Sofitel is two things - the \"name\" and the swanky bar. You pay even bigger bucks for the London W Hollywood because of location, the architecture (which is pretty cool) and the Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Not to mention, both have pools and fitness centers.

I usually have such great experiences based on Trip Advisor reviews; I have never gone wrong with top rated hotels in the various cities I travel to throughout the year. Until now. I will share, the Elan is an AVERAGE hotel. The customer service is by far it's best feature. Very friendly, accomodating staff. But the price for what you get. . . . .I'm sorry, but I will not return nor will I recommend this hotel to others. I actually felt \"ripped off\" when I saw my final bill (versus what I really experienced for the money). And again, it saddens me to share this. The rooms are VERY small. Unless you are traveling alone, the standard King Room is not comfortable for two people. There is also very little bathroom counter space. I had to store most of my products under the sink. For those reviews which state the rooms are spacious, they must have paid more for a suite. So beware, the standard rooms (which are close to $200/night with tax) are VERY, VERY small. I do understand this is a boutique hotel, and have stayed in other boutique hotels in big cities. This is without a doubt the smallest room I have encountered in this hotel class/genre. The Valet Parking attendants were prompt in bringing up our car (just call ahead). But I would have liked a self parking option, so I could simply go to my car and get something without having to have an atttendant help/assist me. But that's just me. The Breakfast was \"okay\", although I did really appreciate the Soy Milk Option. And the Wine/Cheese Evening spread was a very nice touch. But truthfully, I would have preferred to save $20/night (i.e. have this be an optional ammenity) than to have this included in my overall price as we did not partake in this part of the package (1 out of 3 days/nights). I agree with other guests: The WiFi was very slow; you could easily walk into another person's unit via the balcony if the sliding door is not locked (and ours was very difficult to lock as well). Additionally, our heat was not working properly one night and when we called down, the front desk had to \"set it\" for us. I was really taken aback by this. With the money we are spending per night, I would like to think we can control our own temperature needs. I think if this was a #15-20 ranked hotel, my expectations would have been lower, and I would not have been so disappointed. But when a hotel is rated in the top 5, I expect the quality/value I am accustomed when using Trip Advisor. I actually found myself apologizing to my boyfriend for gifting him something so \"average\". Lastly, my boyfriend drank a coke from the mini bar. I know mini bars ALWAYS charge a lot; at all hotels. But I was actually appalled that the cost was $3.00 for a coke, plus a 20% restocking fee. This (in my opinion) is really over the top. The hotel can easily charge $1.00-$1.50 and still make a profit. Why gouge your patrons? I just don't get it. On a positive note, I was very sick the week before our stay. I didn't think I'd be able to make our trip to LA, and I had pre-paid the room (for the advanced purchase rate). The Manager (William) was gracious and said he would reimburse me, if I was not able to make it due to an illness. I was most appreciative of his kindness; the entire staff does go above and beyond.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Forest, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cA Very Satisfied Customer!!\u201d", "Author": "Paul W", "ReviewID": "UR122208656", "Content": "This is an excerpt of the letter that I wrote to the hotel manager. \"I would like to take a minute to thank you and your staff for your superior service and care.

All the other hotels in the area were at least $100 more! We actually booked that morning - they had a couple rooms left. This is a great area - convenient to West Hollywood, La Cienega, and Beverly Center. We arrived at 8pm, and immediately after check in took a cheap cab to the Sunset Strip as it was my first trip to LA. On a nice night you could actually walk to the Strip, but it was cool and getting rainy (plus its an uphill walk). The room was ok. Our 1st floor room had a slider to the side walkway of the hotel - I didnt like being that close to people walking by, but I wasn't at the room very long, and I dont people generally walk out there anyway. As long as you are on a higher floor it wont be an issue. the bathroom was huge and the robes nice. The best part of this place besides location was the breakfast. Wow - I was expecting coffee and a banana when they said continental, but this was great. Selection of coffees, OJ, Lemon Water and some others. Boiled eggs, Bagels (with toaster nearby), jam, oatmeal, yogurt, fruit, pastries and muffins. I think I am leaving out some stuff. Anyway, I was impressed this was included as part of the price of the room. This spread at a diner or coffee shop would have been at least $15pp if they had this selection. Unlimited made it even better! For some this may not be important but I was on a long flight to get here and had lots of things planned so it was nice to get a solid - quick breakfast without having to fork out more money. A few Newspapers were available for free as well! The breakfast area was really nice too - some tables, couch with coffee table and a couple flat screen tv's. Also a few computers were available for use. Overall seemed like a glamourous budget hotel, safe, clean, well situated and staff very motivated to help. No real amenities like a gym or pool but like i said, a great base and good service. We spent the next 3 nights at the Sofitel down the street which was REALLY nice, with pool, gym, spa, and on-site restaurant / nightclub, but you'll pay 20-30% more on any given night. We got a good deal due to it being the week of thanksgiving so it was worth it. If you like to shop, the Beverly Center and Nordstrom's Rack are right there. Melrose Ave is a few blocks north. Robertson St with all the new designers is a 15 min walk, and the Grove about 25 min walk the other way. I'm not big on buses or public transportation, but did take a bus down Melrose Ave one night home from Pink's Hot Dogs (to Melrose at LaCienega) for $1.50 each, because we were sick of paying 10x that for cabs to go just a mile or so down the street. Overall I would stay again, but if I were spending a lot of time at the hotel and got a good deal, I'd upgrade to the Sofitel.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Izmir, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cVine hours\u201d", "Author": "Emnuzt", "ReviewID": "UR121406399", "Content": "Good location, very helpfull and friendly staff and free vine hours at afternoon.

Prime example of their attentiveness is when I valeted my car one afternoon, I mentioned to the valet that I would be leaving again around 6-6:30p that evening. When I called down from my room to have my car pulled up front, they advised me that the valet already had my car waiting for me. Total shock to me as I'm used to calling for my car in the Vegas resorts and still end up waiting 10-15 minutes to pull my car around. TIP - Yes, you do have to valet your car and it is priced at $24/night, but check the hotel's website for park/stay packages that reduce the parking rate to ~$15/night. On top of that, some packages provide a welcome gift, in my case, a box of truffles. Other pluses: Nightly wine reception with cheese and fruit Decent breakfast spread every morning, with fruit, bagels, pastries, cereal, yogurt, juices and coffee (coffee could be a bit stronger, though) Free wireless internet in-room and in the lobby (which in itself is a $10-15 value compared to other hotels) One minus (though you can't blame them for the size of the property) is lack of a pool.

Service was exceptional. We were very well received by the staff, who was friendly and extremely helpful with tips for LA. We had a parking package and the service was quick, and the valets also gave us great tips for nearby dining. They were all very friendly and one of them was also from Brazil. The room was very good, nice space, very clean, great bathroom. Our room faced Beverly Boulevard but we didn't have any issues with street noise. Wi-fi was included and worked well, and they also have two desktops in the lobby for internet access. We had breakfast on the last day there, it was quite good for a complimentary breakfast, with good variety of breads and muffins. The wine and cheese reception was also a nice touch. You do need a car to get around in LA easily, but the location of the Elan is great, with no more than 20-30 minute drives to major attractions like Hollywood, Warner Studios, Santa Monica, Downtown and Beverly Hills. We didn't have any issues with the infamous LA traffic, but being from S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, one of the worst cities in the world to drive a car, probably influenced my opinion. There are also good places that you can walk to, the Beverly Center and a 24 hours CVS are a block away, a great deli called Jerry's is a 10 minute walk, as is a nice bakery called Joan's on 3rd.

The cost was equal to or less than a cab but at a far superior, professional level. These are the little things that make staying at the Elan a treat! Also a treat is the breakfast and evening wine and cheese! My husband and I, and the other couple we were travelling with, all enjoyed coming together to discuss our plans and experiences in a very relaxed way. Also great was the free wi-fi and also computers available for guest in the foyer - as we only had our ipad it was really good to get onto a computer for some browsing.

My husband and I found the hotel on Expedia and booked two nights over the weekend at about $210 a night. We thought the price was pretty good for the location of the hotel, and for a Friday and Saturday night. It's in a decent neighborhood within walking distance to the Beverly Center and other restaurants. There is no self-parking which is not uncommon for a small boutique hotel, so you can either park in a metered spot or valet. Valet was about $26 a day after taxes, and we thought it was worth it. The valet staff was always on top of it. We got our car in and out of valet several times and each time we would just call ahead of time to have our car ready and our car was always right outside within 15 min. Our room at the hotel was not bad. It was on the first floor and opened into a small courtyard facing other rooms. That said, it was not very private if you opened the curtains so we kept the curtains closed most of the time which made the room dark. And the fact that all the lights in the room were fluorescent lighting didn't help, but overall, that didn't bother us. The room was really tiny and the bathroom was pretty small too with virtually no counter space so I had to put all of our toiletries and my makeup on the desk outside of the bathroom. But again, this is not uncommon for a small boutique hotel and it wasn't that big of a deal to us. The light in our bathroom made an annoying buzzing sound and the bed was a little firm and stiff for my tastes though my husband thought the bed was comfortable. The walls were not sound proof as we could hear noises all around us including doors shutting and people talking constantly. When we first checked in, we smelled pot in the hallway and the smell seeped into our room because there isn't a great seal around the door which I'm sure is also what contributed to how easily we could hear outside noises. I called the front desk about the pot smell and they took care of it right away. Overall though, the room was clean and updated pretty well for, what I could tell was, a really old building. It was also nice that they provided complimentary wifi even though it was kind of slow, breakfast in the mornings, and wine and cheese receptions in the evenings.

Sure - it is not the biggest and the most luxurious hotel, you have stayed yet, but these guys just care about the few folks that walk thru their door. After reading reviews about Elan, I ended up calling Debbie, their sales manager to make reservations. As a business traveler, all I care about is a good quiet decent hotel room and a wi-fi internet connection. Elan does not look fancy on the outside, but I have no complains about my room, my bed, the bathroom (with modern amenities and hot water with a lot of pressure!) or anything else. I ended up have a room with a balcony/patio that overlooks an interior commons. Valet parking was super convenient. Since they only have a few guests, they pretty much know which car is yours and you dont have to have a valet ticket that you have to produce everytime. You hand over the keys to the valet and they will take care of the rest. Upon walking out every morning, the car was ready waiting for me. Ads an additional bonus, they have wine-cheese tastings and free breakfast every day; even though I did not care for either, I did notice a lot of folks appreciating the snacks. In fact, it was like a social gathering in the lounge for all these business travelers who normally would not be interacting with one another. Overall, I have no regrets staying with them.

We needed to stay somewhere close in to the west L.A./Hollywood/Santa Monica area to make excursions to good food, sightseeing and a bit of shopping. We've traveled a great deal over the years and are particular when it comes to where we'll stay: Clean, safe and quiet are at the top of our list, followed by friendly staff, good location and reasonable cost. We researched hotels in the L.A. area and were impressed by the Elan. It ranked #2 out of more than 250 hotels rated, so we began by emailing them for availability and to see if they could meet our expectations. Our experience was nothing short of exceptional. Joel, the manager, responded quickly to our requests, providing us with detailed information about the property, room availability, proximity to restaurants and shopping and in general, putting our minds at ease with our decision to stay there, sight unseen. The positive experience begins at the front desk of this centrally located, boutique hotel. The staff is professional and friendly; our request for a quiet room was accommodated; our check in was smooth and the room was comfortable and nicely appointed, from the magnifying mirror in the bathroom to the artwork on the walls: it's the small touches that set this hotel apart. Sure, there's no pool or overpriced coffee shop attached, but the appointments to one's comfort have been carefully thought out. We discovered the Elan was a short walk away from a major shopping center in one direction, about a mile from the Grove and the Farmer's Market the other way. Valet parking eases the burden of driving, and we never had to wait for our car. They even provide a list of radio stations on a card left in the car.

I have been taking my daughter to Cedars-Sinai for 8 years for medical care and usually needed a room for a couple of nights during our visit. I would always use bidding on Priceline to get a bargain. Those bargains are no longer as good as they have been. I called the hotel directly for a Cedars-Sinai rate and it was extremely competitive, in fact lower than the Priceline bid and other area hotels in the same star category. The Elan provides outstanding customer service. It is apparent that is the priority. Because of the time we needed for my daughter's procedure, I requested an early check-in and late check-out and they were very accommodating. The room was spotless and comfy. Every staff member from reservations, valet, front desk to housekeeping performed at the highest expectation. The location is perfect for anyone who goes to Cedars-Sinai as a patient, visitor or for a meeting. You can walk to avoid additional parking fees. There are more restaurants than you can count that are walking distance. CVS is right down the street for pharmacy needs and Jerry's Deli is just a few blocks further for chicken soup! There is no need to spend more money on the Sofitel which is across from Cedars-Sinai(I have many other times). The Elan is much more reasonable and delivers better customer service in a beautiful room, less hassle and a comfy caring atmosphere. Sometimes the smaller boutique hotels I have stayed at in the same area were a great disappointment and I avoided that type of hotel but the Elan is absolutely the gold standard of smaller boutique type hotels. Of course the complimentary continental breakfast and wine reception were a bonus not seen many places in the US and had the quality of a fine European hotel. Easy access to the internet via wifi or the 2 lobby computers are perfect. I also highly recommend the Elan for LA travel and vacation. The location is central to so many areas.

Unfortunately on a personal level we were woken on two mornings when maintenance work in the hotel which we not previously notified about, commenced. It is a tasteful and comfortable small hotel, convenient for the airport and some local amenities, but not much nightlife. The car parking is rather expensive at $24 per night (per 24 hrs regardless how often you use your car) plus tax (which the travel agents don't mention) so it's a bit like giving your car accommodation too! I did know beforehand but having looked at prices around the city, it is a bit steep...probably pays for all the little comps!

So, my caveat to anyone reading this review is that I'm reviewing this hotel based on my experience as a patient and less as a tourist or someone traveling for business. I stayed at the Elan for 7 nights with my mother and husband in a 2 dbl bedroom. I will be staying at the hotel again for a follow-up visit to Cedars Sinai. However, depending on what you are going in for this may or may not be the option for you. Here are the pros and cons of staying at this hotel as a patient: PROS: 1) extremely close to hospital; w/in walking distance or a cheap, short cab ride ($5) if need be; 2) staff is extremely courteous and prompt if you have any issues w/ the room; 3) rooms are extremely clean!!! as a patient, i found this to be very important; 4) beds are very comfortable, also very important if you are recovering from something; 5) free breakfast in the morning - not a hot breakfast, but plenty of great things to eat which was very convenient and a major cost-savings 6) although they don't have a restaurant onsite, they do have a deli that delivers often to the site in case you want to eat in; 7) if you don't want to eat in, there are plenty of restaurants nearby to eat in or get take-out (note: just prior to my procedure, we ate at Grand Lux Cafe only a short walk away, and all 3 of us contracted major food poisoning!!!!!!!!!!! this almost jeopardized my entire purpose out there. Fortunately, we were so close to the hospital, so my mom & I were able to get to the ER very quickly with a cab that the hotel called for us. But don't eat at the Grand Lux!!!; 8) there is a refrigerator in the room as well as a microwave to reheat any leftovers 9) free wifi - which was great for my husband since he worked from the hotel while I was back and forth to the hospital; 10) we had a slight problem w/ our room and needed to switch after a day or 2. As a tourist, the problems (described below) wouldn't have bothered me too much, but since I was a patient and spending a lot of time in the room, they became important. Due to the inconvenience of having to switch rooms, the hotel actually comped us 1 night - which was extremely generous; 11) whenever we needed transportation anywhere, there was a cab waiting within minutes. CONS: 1) if you are staying there for an extended period of time, you may want a kitchenette which this hotel does not offer; 2) the wifi wasn't always the best and neither was cell service, but it's free, so can't complain; 3) we had some slight problems w/ our bathtub drain backing up and the keys were tempermental - sometimes they worked, sometimes they didn't, so we went through lots of keys. But the hotel made up for this (see #10 above) So, as you could see, I thought the Elan was a great choice for my purpose. As I mentioned before, I plan on staying there again for a follow-up visit. The staff was extremely helpful and courteous. Even when we did experience problems, they took them seriously, were prompt in trying to fix them, but offered for us to switch rooms (which we did) and still comped us 1 night.

The rooms although not big were very clean and comfortable, with all the necessary facilities including free WiFi, good size bathroom and great king-sized bed. I took the advice from the reviews and requested a room on the 2nd floor away from the elevator, so it was really quiet. I arranged airport pick-up and drop-off through the hotel. The cost was $55 each way. The driver was named Cesar and his service was excellent. We really liked this boutique hotel, very much enjoyed staying at the Elan.

The Elan staff made sure to stow our luggage for the better part of the 2nd day of our LA time and the day of our flight and-- are you ready for this-- let us borrow a small single unit to shower and dress for our flight. The suites we stayed in were roomy and wonderful-- if you were on your own and really didn't need the space of a suite, then this tiny room would be okay, but honestly, it was almost difficult just to bring wheeled duffle bags into the single unit. It definitely served the purpose, but this would not be a chosen room for a couple.

Firstly, I was kept waiting at check in for five minutes while the receptionist took a phone call. This may not seem like a big deal but I was tired and just wanted to get to my room. He did apologize for the delay but I felt he should have acknowledged my presence at least when he was on the phone. He was very friendly and told me about the breakfast and wine and cheese. I then told him that I was under 21, which he should have realized by looking at my passport a few minutes previously. I then went up to my room which was small but still felt luxurious. Ten minutes later, however, I got a phone call from reception to inform me that all alcohol would have to be removed from my room and they would send someone up. I understand they have to do this but it just felt like a massive inconvenience when all I wanted to do was fall into bed. The next day the maid attempted to put alcohol back into the room and I had to explain to her that I was told I cannot have access to alcohol according to the hotel's policy and she accepted this but I feel she should have known! To top matters off there was a small fire in the hotel one of the mornings I stayed there. I felt we got minimal explanation and the hotel smelled of smoke for most of the day which made my stay unpleasant. The location was good, close to the shops which was what I was interested in and the free internet was great. The breakfast was basic but it was appreciated as it is such a rarity to receive a complimentary breakfast in a hotel these days. Overall I feel I may have been unlucky with my stay.

The Hotel Elan was the first hotel of the trip, and definitely one of the best. Location - The hotel was easy to find by car, just pull up at the front for the valet parking. Saying it's close to the Beverley Centre doesn't do it justice - it's literally a 30 second walk away! There is also a CSV pharmacy opposite, and a gas station next door. We ate at the Grand Lux Cafe at the Beverley Centre, and really enjoyed the food (massive portions!). The hotel is a 20-30 minute walk to Sunset Boulevard, and a short taxi ride to Hollywood. Room - We stayed in a deluxe double, and the room was a very good size with a large bed and a huge balcony looking out onto Beverly Blvd. Despite this there was no road noise at night, and we slept very well. The bathroom was large and clean, and I particularly liked the smell of the toiletries! Housekeeping were great, and the turn-down service with chocolates and the weather forecast was a lovely touch. There was a really useful information booklet in the room that included reviews and location of local restaurants. There were a large number of TV channels, and also free wi-fi. Facilities - Unfortunately we didn't attend the drinks and wine reception as we weren't back at the hotel in time on both evenings, but we did enjoy the breakfast buffet. It was well stocked with bagels, muffins, cereal, yoghurt, pastries, boiled eggs, fruit, and juices and coffee with take-away cups available. Staff - The staff were all extremely polite, friendly and helpful. The valet guys took me downstairs to the car to collect my sunglasses when I'd left them down there without any problem, and the reception staff were happy to give directions and recommend restaurants. As we only had one full day to see LA we decided to go on the Starline City Sightseeing hop on-hop off bus tour, which we boarded just outside the Beverley Centre (outside Macy's menswear entrance). We used two of the four available loops, and went to Hollywood, then through Beverley Hills and Rodeo Drive and on to Santa Monica, where we spent the afternoon on the pier. It was a great value tour which cost $30, you can buy tickets when you board the bus, no need to book. We also went out with some friends on Sunset Strip in the evening, and went to the Rainbow Bar & Grill and Mel's Diner, both of which we'd recommend (particularly Rainbow Bar & Grill for the generous spirit measures!).

Our room included a king bed, work table, safe, mini bar etc. The size of the room was fine and we heard no noise at all as our room was located at the back of the hotel. Breakfast is included in the price and comes with a variety of cereals, yogurts, bagels etc. There is enough on offer to fill you up for the day. The location of the hotel is good. It is difficult to get the ideal location in a city like Los Angeles which is very spread out. As we were only in the city for a few days we did not hire a car. I would certainly recommend hiring a car if you are staying in the city for any longer than a few nights. The taxis are expensive and the distance between tourist sights is further than it looks on the map!

I did not partake in the free wine and cheese reception in the late afternoons, but definitely enjoyed the free breakfast every day that included yogurt, oatmeal, cereal, pastries, bagels, juices, coffee, etc. Chocolate croissants, yum! I do have one complaint - when I checked in and was given a room on the first floor I asked if it was quiet. I was told it would be. However, I was awoken fairly early every morning due to my room's close proximity to the pantry where they keep the breakfast supplies. I could hear them pouring ice into basins and rolling carts back and forth.

Well I must say I am a bit disappointed. It's partially my fault for not researching the area a bit better. I first stayed at a hotel in Venice Beach and really liked the proximity to the beach and the activities around there. I changed because the hotel in Venice Beach had a very high weekend price. The location of the Elan Hotel is ok I guess. It is right on Beverly Blvd and near the Beverly Center but I personally did not like the area too much. It seemed a bit scruffy and not very appealing to me. Also Beverly Blvd is quite a loud street and my room was facing the road which meant that I could here all the trucks and cars passing by the whole time since the room did not have an sound proof at all. I could even hear the voices of people walking on the sidewalk. I personally was not that bothered by it but still it was a bit annoying. So I would recommend people who are sensitive to noise to get a room facing away from the main street. Check-In staff was efficient but not overly friendly, just ok. The room itself was very nicely furnished and everything was working fine. Housekeeping is probably the best asset of the hotel as they really took care of the room with a lot of attention to detail and really made an effort. Breakfast was quite good with a good choice of items from cereals to bagels to hard boiled eggs. Valet parking was OK but a bit annoying since you always have to wait for them to get the car in the garage next door. It would be so much easier if they would have self parking. However since it's Beverly Hills, you are stuck with valet parking almost everywhere. So I guess if you want to be in Beverly Hills then stay there, if you are a first time visitor to LA I would not recommend it, since traffic around there is pretty bad at times and the freeway is not really that close to go to places. I guess the experience was ok but that's all.

But, unfortunately, there is only so much you can do with a building shell that was obviously a former motel. To provide a bit more background about my travel style, and therefore expectations: I am a TA devotee. When I travel, I always consult TA first and then make my travel plans accordingly. Everyone who knows me knows of my faith in the TA community and our honest, helpful reviews. When my mom and I were planning this short trip to LA, I told her that I would plan the hotel and assured her that she was in good hands. She is more of a hotel brand name follower and I'm sure would have preferred that we booked with Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton, since those brand names give her comfort - and for good reason, since they invariably deliver on their promise of luxury, often at a price. Back to the Elan - when we arrived at the hotel and pulled up alongside where the valet station was located, I could feel my stomach drop. The website, while only providing limited pictures and none of the exterior of the entire building, certainly did not prepare me for what I was seeing. As I mentioned above, the exterior showed a two-story building that was most likely a former motel or travel lodge. The lobby was small, but nicely decorated, as were the rooms themselves. It is obvious that considerable renovations were done to this property, as the furniture in the room had little extra touches, such as wood trim and a flat screen TV. Also, the shower head and water pressure in the bathroom were superb. But unfortunately, the room itself was extremely small, as were the \"balcony\" and bathroom. I was also disappointed with the quality of the linens. Most distressing was the room's heating mechanism, or more accurately, lack there of - the instructions on the unit were extremely confusing and even when we figured them out and did as instructed, we were still left shivering in a very chilly room! Given the attentiveness of the staff, I feel comfortable that someone would have come to lend a hand if we had called, but we were so tired from being out all day during both days of our short stay, we were simply too tired to hassle with it and just bundled up for bed. Some high points - the breakfast buffet provided a lovely array of baked goods. Also, the location was right down the road from the Beverly Center and close to freeway access. Unfortunately, the road on which the hotel is located (Beverly) is rather busy and the traffic was a bit noisy at night. The free high speed internet really was free and really did work, which was a nice surprise. Overall, this wasn't a bad property - but honestly I was expecting so much more given that it is rated as #1 in all of Los Angeles! This is the first time that I have ever felt let down by TA reviews, and unfortunately I now fear that it has made a skeptic out of my mother. I would not return to this property because I feel that with the great number of hotels within the greater Los Angeles area, there is probably somewhere that I would enjoy more. But I do give kudos to the owners and management of this property for making the most of what they have to work with.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, UK", "Title": "\u201cDespite intial appearances, you very quickly come to understand the great reviews\u201d", "Author": "FrequentTraveller70", "ReviewID": "UR50638946", "Content": "We booked this hotel based on the excellent reviews on Tripadvisor, and although on first site of the exterior we were a tad disappointed (especially given that we were paying more to stay here than we had at the 5 star Wynn in Las Vegas), we soon came to understand the great reviews. The staff cannot be faulted and were very professional and hospitable - better than we've had in some 5 star hotels!!! Even the cleaners made you smile as whilst they don't have the nicest of jobs to do, they do their work smiling and laughing with their colleagues yet managing to do a good job. Michael (Front Desk) deserves special mention. There was a small mix up on arrival - we were given keys to a room which was still being cleaned; Michael gave us keys to another room and told us to take a look, and if not, we could wait for the other one (ask for a room facing out rather than into their atrium area as these rooms can be dark. Also, following recommendations from other Tripadvisor guests, we had also requested a room on the 2nd floor). We waited for our room and were immediately sent up a bottle of decent wine as an apology. Apart from the charge for parking (discussed later), there are no hidden costs at this hotel which makes a nice change. Internet, Breakfast and wine & cheese in the evening (decent wine, cheese/crackers could be better) were all complimentary. Breakfast is decent: bagels (toaster available), danishes, muffins, hardboiled eggs (cold), yogurts, cereal and a selection of tea and coffee and fully available from 6.30am (as we found out on the morning of check-out - much appreciated). Rooms are small but nice. We had problems with the heating and so found ourselves in reception each evening, and whilst they tried tweaking their computers, there was no change in temperature; in the end we took up their offer of a portable heater - so my recommendation here is ask, and they will try and help.. Good supply of towels. Nice beds. Good location, being situated in West Hollywood; as near main road, very easy to get to Hollywood and Beverly Hills. To stay here (and probably anywhere in LA) you would need a car. Big shopping mall 2 mins walk away (Beverly Centre) and plenty of places to eat - have a look at the info pack in your room which gives you a list of good restaurants which are walkable distance, and others that you would need to drive to. The Grove (posh eating/shopping/cinema complex is also only about 10 mins away in a car). There is a charge for Parking, which with taxes is $21 a night. Whilst the thought of paying so much for parking is not a a nice one, it is worth it given the lack of parking in the vicinty (very confusing signage). They park your car away from the main road, but we never had to wait more than a few mins for our car and the valet staff were very friendly and courteous. My suggestion is to just budget this into the cost of the hotel stay and then forget about it. In summary, whilst by no means cheap, this hotel is probably very good value given the location and the fact that decent hotels in LA are not cheap.

In addition, \"Jan's\" (a fine, well-known coffee shop) is just across the street, and there are several other restaurants on the block. Plus the Beverly Center is only about 100 yards away. The room was large and furnishings were up to date and comfortable. Plenty of outlets for charging the cell phones, GPS, and oh yes, the FREE wireless internet connection was a bonus. I am soooo tired of hotels charging $175+ a night for a room PLUS $10 or more per day for internet service -- such a ripoff! The FREE wireless connection here was reliable and if you didn't bring your laptop, there were three computers downstairs in the lobby, available 24 hours a day, for guest use.

The hotel is within walking distance to many nice restaurants, stores, and a very nice huge (3-story) mall just one block down Beverly Blvd. When I stay in hotels, it's all about \"cleanliness\" to me. I am the pickiest of anyone I know when it comes to cleanliness, and I was definitely satisified here. Our room (and bathroom) was immaculate! Our beds were some of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in with very nice (and very expensive) sheets. Great fluffy pillows too! Our room had a nice big flat-screen tv, large desk with re-charging outlets for cell phones, and free wi-fi. Nice fluffy bath robes, house slippers (new in plastic packages), ironing board w/iron, and blow dryer were also provided . A refrigerator is also in the room which we used for our bottled water. Our room was on the bottom floor, and we were never bothered by any outside noises, i.e., traffic, etc. It was very quiet and relaxing. The bathroom was big and roomy with a good \"strong\" shower head and lots of hot water! (No low water pressure here!) A few added extras were the lighted swing-out make-up mirror mounted on the wall and the full-length mirror on the inside of the bathroom door. Every morning a free \"continental\" breakfast is served in the lobby area. It was one of the best continental breakfasts I have ever had. They had a large selection of pastries (croissants, donuts, muffins, bagels, fruit-filled pastries), several cereal choices, fresh fruit, and for drinks: coffee, orange juice, and milk. I normally don't partake in these free continental breakfasts, but this one was \"over and above\" the standard. Also in the lobby is a computer center (with several computers and printers) which is available free of charge to hotel guests. I never utilized them since I had my laptop with me, but I noticed other guests using the computers frequently. The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. They were all very professional (& professionally dressed!) and always greeted us with a smile. Regarding finding a place to park, you must valet-park in their parking garage. There are a couple of street parking spaces on the side street that runs alongside the hotel, but you must move your car by 8am. I didn't want to have to run outside to move my car each morning (and where would I move it to???), so for $19/day (plus tips to the valets), you just pull up to the front door, and they will move your car to their underground parking garage.

The location, cleanliness and value for money are great but what absolutely sets this hotel above others is the outstanding commitment to customer service. As this was my first visit to LA I did quite a lot of research and chose this hotel due to the positive reflections in other reviews. After booking I made enquiries from the hotel regarding getting from LAX to the hotel. William suggested a fixed rate option with a taxi and made all transport arrangements for us with the whole process going like clockwork. We were met inside the terminal by Caesar (taxi driver extraordinare!) who collected our luggage from the carousel and whisked us into LA to be met at the door of the Elan by Paoulo who took our luggage direct to our room. The service remained at this standard for the three days with any request, from just general info to tour bookings responded to immediately with no fuss. The room was very quiet and clean with two double beds so just perfect for us. The bathroom was modern and spotless. The complimentary wine and cheese at 5pm each day was delightful and a nice way to unwind before dinner. We also appreciated the weather forecast delivered to our room when we returned to the hotel in the evening as we could plan clothes for the next day. This was particularly helpful as the temperature increased by 12 degrees (to 88) on our second day.

First, the minuses: The cost of the valet parking. I realize the hotel is in West Hollywood, but $19 a day seems a bit steep, especially when self-parking under the hotel seems a viable option. Then there's the noise. Our first room was next to a prep area for the buffets, so starting very early every morning, we got a blast of tinkling glasses and rolling carts. We were also subject to hearing loud conversations in the lobby. And on the second afternoon, a mysterious buzzing/rumbling began that didn't let up for the next 18 hours. It wasn't loud enough to prevent sleep -- but was just under that threshold. And cell phone accessibility is spotty. Oh, and of the three public computers in the lobby, only one is connected to the printer. Not necessarily a problem, but when one woman spends more than an hour surfing on and printing menus from seemingly every restaurant in the greater Los Angeles area, it can be a little frustrating. Those caveats out of the way, we had a great time. When we told the staff about the above-mentioned noise, they were johnny-on-the-spot about investigating and moving us to a new and far quieter room. The staff is the hotel's biggest plus; unfailingly friendly and efficient, they're gems. (On checkout, when a false honor bar charge appeared on our bill, the desk clerk took it off with no argument, and on our final night, when we arrived back at the hotel quite late, they offered us the option of a later checkout.) The beds are very comfortable and the amenities are quite nice. Showers are a little lacking, but acceptable (even if the boiler went out for a while on our second morning).

Omar at the front desk is a sweetheart, always a smile and a hello when he saw me come in in the afternoons. Check-in no hassle at all. Room 206 one queen bed, inside room VERY quiet. Room is small but I was alone so it was fine. Great bed and bedding, 4 great pillows and 4 throw pillows besides and an extra one in the closet. Iron and ironing board in closet too. Desk and chair and internet connection and a large flat screen TV. Small bathroom but adequate with very nice toiletries. Yikes!! no hair dyer and I didn't take one!! No problem, I told Karla the housekeeping girl that I had thought I had read there were hair dyers in the rooms, she said she'd see what she could do and of course when I got back that afternoon there was the needed item. There is also a free in-room safe which I didn't use, I just locked everything in my suitcases and it was fine. Having breakfast included is heavenly. If, however, you need eggs over easy or pancakes or anything substantial you'll do better going across the street to Jan's Restaurant, more on that in a minute. The buffet breakfast has yoghurt, granola, cereal, milk, orange juice, coffee, hot water for the lovely teas they offer, danish, muffins and bagels and yes, they have cream cheese. There's a toaster and a microwave and oh, on a couple of days they had the most heavenly freshly baked banana nut bread. They also have a fruit bowl with bananas, apples and oranges. Breakfast is from 6:30-10:30am. There is also a little outdoor terrace for breakfast for you smokers or those wanting to enjoy the morning sun. I never got around to the wine in the evening, I always got back to the hotel late after siteseeing and shopping. They also have one computer in the little lobby so you can check your email at no extra cost. Jan's Restaurant is right across the street, but of course you have to walk a block one way just to cross and then a half a block to reach the restaurant. They serve breakfast all day and night so one night I went all out and had a big breakfast and on my last night I had dinner there; prices are fair and the food is decent. Take a bus from La Cienega to Sunset and you have all the hot night spots and restaurants or stay on the bus and it will take to straight to Hollywood. Walk a couple of blocks to 3rd street and hop a bus right to The Grove, or go the other way and head to Rodeo Drive. You can get any where you want from the Elan by bus. For you shoppers you have within 3 blocks of the hotel, Beverly Center with Macy's and Bloomingdales as anchors; Lohmann's Men across the street and a block up Lohmann's women's. There is a Grand Luxe Caf\u00c3\u00a9 where I ate twice, expensive but I was on vacation.

Recpetion was really efficient as was the valet for the car. We had a room at the front of the hotel which was adequately big enough and very clean. The service was good, especially when the newly installed cable broke on four occasions in the first 36 hours. The gym with which the hotel is assocaited is really good and really close (and if you're into running, don't run outside in LA unless you want an asthma attack - seriously). Breakfast was really good - lots to choose from and constantly re-stocked. There's just one thing-the moise of the traffic. We both had ear plugs and boy, did we need them. The traffic doesn't stop all night. Try and get a room at the back although I'm unsure as to whether this would be any better.

The room was a matchbox and very nasty. We sleep in all of our clothes the first night because we could not adjust the AC and the street stunk. The bathtub was dirty and the sink was stopped up. When we requested another room the staff told us that they were completely soldout all week. Expedia wouldnt give us our money back and told us that we were on our own if we wanted to go elsewhere. The only thing that saves this hotel from me giving it complete \"TERRIBLE\" rating is that the manager and staff were extremely apologetic and accomodating understanding our concerns.

Really enjoyed the complimentary breakfast, more than sufficient for a day's siteseeing. The cheese/wine in the evenings was also very good, nice touches. However, we did leave a little disappointed. After our arrival, one of the Desk Clerks asked us had we plans to attend a show while in LA, he recommeded either Jersey Boys or Wicked, we opted for Jersey Boys as it's not due in Europe until 2008. He said he could get tickets for $115 which we thought was quite alot but he assured us they were good tickets, so we went ahead. With booking fee etc. the total at $245. When we got to the theatre we were very upset to see our $115 tickets actually had a face value of $60 so we paid $110 over the odds (not something we would never, ever do), we felt quite \"done\". Taxis each way were $40 plus tips so overall an expensive night. We edmention it to the desk clerk when we returned that evening and he did apologise, however, they should tell guests they are booking with an agent and that the tickets will be inflated in price in future. It made us wonder whether the hotel have a deal going with the booking agent......... So be warned, book your own tickets or check the face value of the tickets before you buy.

What sets this property apart from so many other hotels is the amazing service of its staff. Few places I have stayed have rivaled the front desk/concierge service of the Elan. (Note: The Elan doesn't really have room service; they can provide it from the diner across the street.) The Elan's front desk/concierge staff's service easily reminded me of several Four Seasons. During my stay, the front desk/concierge staff went above and beyond to provide information and directions about local sights and restaurants. They volunteered to print out personalized driving directions and explained how to (try to) avoid the LA rush hour. Most amazing, however, was after checking out and getting directions to the airport, the one of the front desk/concierge staff gave me his business card and said to please call the hotel if I got lost, stuck in traffic, or needed further assistance on my way. Few hotels care enough about their guests to offer to assist them after they have left and paid their bill. Our room (111) was small, but nice and clean. As it was below street level, it had no view whatsoever, but overall we were pretty happy with it. The worst part about the Elan is that the neighborhood isn't that great. Across the street is a Taco Bell and a Goodwill store and next door to the hotel is a car tire shop. Excluding the massive Beverly Center mall a few blocks away, there really aren't any good restaurants, coffee shops, or anything else of interest nearby the hotel. Fortunately, however, the sights of Beverly Hills, Melrose, Hollywood, and other, better LA neighborhoods aren't too far away (relatively speaking).

The AC was perfect, fridge full of soft drinks and also some wine and beer, big TV with up to 20 channels plus a VCR, plus a choice of some very good films to get from the reception. For a woman a provided good iron was a must. Great bathroom with a bath-tube, nice toiletries, a bathrobe, thick towels of all sizes. Every evening when I came to the room, a small lamp was on, a few chocolate bonbons with a wish of a good sleep and a weather forecast for the next day on the bed, that was a very nice homely touch. WiFi was included in the price of the room. Breakfast was very good although basic - yoghurt, cereals, fresh bagels, marmalade, boiled eggs, great coffee, some fruits. The concierge was truly amiable and helpful every day with my questions about \"the best way to get there and there..\", they were absolutely amazing.

My employer usually uses Le Meridien, which is around the corner on La Cienega, but it closed on the 9th for a long renovation. Sofitel just up the street was too expensive. The Elan lived up to the promises made on its Web site. It is a clean, simple, small property in a fabulous location. I walked to WeHo nightlife, breakfast and shopping on 3rd Street, dinner, and shopping at the Beverly Center. In fact, I valet parked my car at 5 p.m. on Friday and had no need to drive again until 2 p.m. on Saturday---very unusual for L.A.! I stayed in room 209 which is on the street side, southwest corner. I recommend the room unless you are super-sensitive to street noise, as it had its own private balcony. Views weren't great, but from one corner of the balcony I could see the Hollywood Hills. Directly across the street was a Taco Bell and a Goodwill Store; to the west, Macy's and Bloomingdale's were so close, you could practically throw a baseball and hit the side of their building. Room itself was fairly spare but had everything one would need, and it was very clean. Modern, well-appointed, nice carpeting, good furniture, good bed, nice linens, and a clean bathroom with good quality soaps and shampoos. Honor bar. FREE wireless internet. Yes, FREE. You don't get that in the fancy places! I got a rate of $169/night through my corporate travel agent, which beat the hotel's own Web site by $20/night. Valet parking was $16/night, which isn't cheap but not bad, really. There are nearby meters and when I did use my car, I sometimes parked at a meter rather than go through the whole valet drop-off procedure. Not to worry, though: when you call for your car, it's usually curbside within three minutes; the garage is under the building. There aren't many amenties on-site, but, really, who cares? You can walk to shopping, restaurants, nightlife, etc. There's a very small fitness center with 3 or 4 treadmills and stair machines. But it's L.A., for goodness sake, so if you want to go running, you just hit the streets. (Actually, I recommend visiting Runyon Canyon Park for a fun hike/run and incredible views of the L.A. city basin; about a 10 or 15 minute drive from the hotel.) Room rate includes continental breakfast in the lobby. This was really quite decent: cereals, pastries, fresh fruit, yogurt, juices, coffee/tea. What more do you need? Plenty of tables and seating areas, with views onto Beverly Blvd., where you can eat. Also some seating on patio. There is a small \"business center\" room with a computer and printer, where I printed out my boarding pass for flight home, plus a small conference table. Nothing fancy, but if you needed to have a little business meeting with a few associates, it would be fine. Staff were uniformly pleasant, cheerful, helpful, from the valet/doorman guy to the desk clerk to the maids. No complaints there. One thing I was puzzled about was what the views are from the rooms that are on the inner corridor. As I mentioned, I was in a room on the exterior of the building, on a corner, but the hallway went in a full rectangle, so the inner rooms must look out onto some sort of courtyard or something. I would ask for a room onto the back alley or onto the street, myself. Again, I highly recommend room 209, as it's a corner room with balcony. So often you book a room at a hotel that looks kinda cool on the Web site, and then you get there only to have your expectations not met and your hopes dashed. The Elan was a pleasant surprise. Keep your expectations realistic (this ain't the Four Seasons, folks), and you'll be happy. Need nightlife?

Once inside you have an impression of a retro hotel of the 60's where the one main room doubles for a lounge/breakfast/buffet area. My one complaint regarding this room is that it has no blinds. This causes a problem in the morning when the sun shines directly into your eyes while you eat breakfast. In the evening when they serve a brilliant free cheese and wine buffet you can still be viewed from the road. I found it a little too open for comfort.......consider blinds please! We stayed there on two separate occassions, both times the rooms were clean and tidy, although if you are allocated room number 229 try not to sleep in the bed near the window, as the air condition via the vent is directed to the head. I had to sleep with a towel on my head to prevent it from freezing. (I did try to alter the airconditioning but it then became too hot). The situation of this hotel is magnificent, it is in the centre of all the tourist haunts, and the hotel will arrange trips for you on request.

In between these stays, we were holidaying in other US locations. We were visiting the US for a vacation and are Australians. We've been to LA several times before so sightseeing in LA was not a priority. Rather, relaxing and having fun in Beverly Hills was our objective. This hotel was therefore located well for us, being very close to the Beverly Center mall and close to the \"hip\" shopping streets of Beverly Hills - eg, Robertson Boulevard, and Melrose. A downside to the location is that Beverly Boulevard (in the direction away from the Beverly Center) is sometimes a little seedy: There were some suspicious characters hanging around in the street but they did not appear dangerous (but what do I know?). There are plenty of good restaurants nearby. However, our favourite restaurant is, in fact, a diner (!!) right opposite the Elan. It is called Jan's coffee house. It has wonderful food and if you use Google you will find out quickly that it is a traditional US diner. The customers are locals and either baby boomers or older seniors. It is popular and noisy but in a fun way. The Elan delivers meals from Jan's if you request room service. A menu from Jan's is in each room. We didn't take great advantage of the free Elan morning buffet (which was fine) as we liked the bigger breakfasts (many types of omelettes and other all day breakfast dishes) and coffee (which some on the internet rate as LA's best coffee!) at Jan's. However, my husband brought up coffee and fruit juice from the buffet to get us started, first thing each morning. At the end of each day, the complimentary wine and cheese was a great wind down / wind up. The usual idiot talking loudly on his cell phone to all his great clients threatened to spoil one such occasion. What can you do? These idiots are everywhere nowadays (sigh). The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean and comfortable, and all the electrical appliances worked well. Daily room service was unobtrusive and meticulous. Beds were comfy. Airconditioning was a little temperamental, but that may have been our lack of skill. The elevator was satisfactory but could use a clean. (If staff are reading this, I am sure they will immediately clean it!) We had a small balcony outside our room. We liked our room overlooking Beverly Boulevard as you feel part of the city and it really comes alive at dawn with traffic. (You can request a quieter room not overlooking the boulevard if you prefer. ) What sets this hotel apart from others, however, is the superior service provided at the front desk. Eg: Every time we came close to entering the front glass doors, a man ran to open them for us and greeted us with a friendly smile. The staff were genuinely interested in where we were from, what we planned to do for the day, and any particular requests we had. Yet they did not once become nosy. They know exactly where to draw the line. Also, every complaint we made (and yes, we did have a few minor ones such as asking for a tradesman to stop cleaning a carpet in a nearby room with a noisy machine while we were in our room) was answered with an apology and immediate attention and resolution of our complaint. Eg: When we rejected a Beverly Hills cab that they had called because a horribly scruffy, dirty looking man alighted from the taxi (he was the driver!!!) they called us another cab immediately and apologised. They did not criticise us for not caring about a scruffy cab driver or refusing to accept the cab. When the scruffy cab driver came into the lobby to ask where the passengers were, I heard the desk clerk say, \"They (meaning us) changed their mind\". He was pretty smooth! On our second stay in January we rented a car at the airport and the valet parking was perfect. We tipped every now and again and when we didn't tip (due to rushing) the man was still just as nice to us. The man who carried our bags to our room on arrival and from our room on departure was quick and attentive, and competent. Our bed was turned down each evening and the radio was on playing soothing music. There were small chocolates left on the bed for us each evening and a printed note relaying the next day's weather forecast. I had my laptop with me and so used the free wifi access which worked well. There was other internet access available for guests. The front desk staff will go to any lengths to help the guests with requests or complaints. The staff seem to really enjoy being in the hospitality game. Both my husband and I recommend this place highly for the superior front desk service and great location!

The property is in an older remodeled building. The rooms are cozy with contemporary fixtures throughout. But, this is not the hotel to choose if your plans are to cocoon yourself in your room.

After reading loads of reviews about crabby and skanky hotels in LA, I was at a wits end until I chanced upon the reviews of Hotel Elan on Tripadvisor. Based on the raving reviews, we booked 3 rooms in Oct and were totally glad we trusted Tripadvisor.com once again! The Hotel Elan is a shining beacon in a sea of really expensive hotels and really crabby motels in LA. It may be a \"higher-end\" budget place or as some term it a \"boutique\" hotel, however what sealed our wonderful experience here was really the staff at reception. Practically everyone at reception was super helpful, friendly and took obvious pride in their work. They took pains to ask us each day where we intended to go, and unprompted, printed driving maps for us and gave us very clear directions - really helpful for us as we were used to driving on the other side of the road! We felt really welcome here and got great advice from the staff about places to go, restaurants and night spots. The rooms are nicely appointed, although on the small side. And as this used to be an old folk's home before it was given new life as a hotel, the hallways still retain an \"old folks home\" feeling. We had 3 rooms - 2 were small and faced the inner courtyard, 1 was at the end of the corridor and was distinctly larger. If you prefer more space for your rooms, ask for the rooms at the end of the corridors. The location was convenient as well, close to Sunset and Santa Monica Blvds, and it was easy getting to the major freeways. I loved the fact that I could walk to Beverly Center shopping mall, which was useful since I had a free day by myself whilst my friends went to Magic Mountain. I spent an entire day at the mall and walked back by myself after dark - it was quite safe. The free continental breakfast that comes with the room was more than adequate. The lobby area does get quite crowded during peak breakfast time, and like another reviewer pointed out, it gets really hot with the sun streaming in. We tried to get back in time for the free wine reception but alas, the sights of LA beckoned and we never did made it in time. Was a nice thought though. Overnight parking for our car was $14 in an underground garage - it was great to have a valet park it and bring it around in the morning. On our second day, the guy at reception recognised us and before we could request for our car, it was driven out whilst we were having breakfast - great service! Overall, we loved the Hotel Elan! I was especially relieved as I was i/c of booking the hotel for our party of 6. Thanks once again TripAdvisor!

Free wireless and a free printer in the business centre are definitely a step above the hotels that charge ten bucks a night for internet. And the 5-7 wine reception is a very nice touch. The not-so-good: The rooms are small, the decor is bland, and the hallways are especially ugly. The location? Other than the fact that there's a huge mall a block away, there's nothing to recommend it. The Elan Modern is on a bland stretch of Beverley Blvd., across from a Taco Bell and a greasy spoon. The hotel is only two storeys high, so most of the rooms are uncomfortably close to the street, which sometimes gets quite noisy. The buffet breakfast (included in the room rate) is OK, but it's served in the lobby, which on sunny days (this being L.A., that means most days) is uncomfortably hot, with barely any shade.

I had a huge fear of paying a ton of money to be treated like crap or have a bad experience, so I really sweated the hotel selection. I craved a modern decor and not a chain hotel, and leaned toward the Chamberlain for awhile, but eventually decided on the Elan thanks to the reivews on this site. I booked thru Travelocity and paid $155/night from Nov 19 to Nov 24, checking out on Nov 25. This was for the king sized bed suite. We could not have been happier with the entire experience. Though the room was not huge, it was perfectly adequate and comfortable for the two of us (and bro & gf) to lounge between activities. Dead quiet at night (we had a room off the back alley of the hotel), we slept great every night (wonderful linens). Only had the continental breakfast one day (6:30 to 10am) because we overslept the rest of the week. :D You had your choice of cereals, breads to toast, fruit, hardboiled eggs, juice and milk. And every evening from 5 to 7 was the wine and cheese tasting, which we frequented a lot more. :D We never got around to it, but you could also have massage in your hotel room. There is also a small work out room, but darn, never got in there either. ;P Did duck in once to use the business room computer for some directions, which we printed. Also, we had a balcony so the boys could go out and smoke...see pic...(all the other guest pix on this site have the rooms and other views covered) The staff was friendly and polite, especially Yolanda during check in. There is an ice machine in the basement right off the elevator, and several conveniences nearby. I joked that this hotel was my destiny, as there was a Taco Bell right across the street. We ate at Jan's Restaurant Sunday night because everything at Beverly Center was closed. Did finally break down one late night when getting back to the area, and got some Taco Bell. There is also the Mexican chain Alcupulco (sp?) and Norm's diner right around the corner. And to top it off, a gas station right up the street so we could feed our Pepsi/Mountain Dew fix in a town oversaturated with Coke products, and a drugstore right across the street from there, for all those little things we forgot. There is also a Jamba Juice, Baja Express and Souplantation right down the cross street (La Cienega I think). Do some exploring b/c there is plenty around the area, but it is nice and quiet at night so you can recover from the craziness that is LA during the day. When my brother moved out to LA, my dad spent $90 to stay in a Days Inn in the Studio City area, so I sure felt the Elan was worth it...despite the crazy drive over the canyon with my brother behind the wheel... I could not recommend it more, and would absolutely book there again if needing to be in the area...it was a great trip, and a lot of that was thanks to the cute little Elan Hotel Modern.", "Date": "November 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed stay at the Elan\u201d", "Author": "moodster", "ReviewID": "UR6157967", "Content": "Spent 2 nights here at the beginning of November and found it very pleasant.

It is very sad if this is one of the top hotels in LA...b/c frankly it was not good AT ALL!! The room I was given at first was on the main floor and was sooo loud, it was ridiculous!! The bed comforter had stains all over and so did the carpet and headboard. The carpet edges were brown with dirt and were very frayed and tattered. Overall the room was very old and worn looking - marks all over the wall etc. - much in need of a reno. The garbage had not been cleaned out from the previous guest and there were hairs in both the sink and all over the tub. The room framework ie. bed, comforter headboard(as seen in pics) looks nice but it is deceiving. I asked to switch to a clean and quieter room. The front desk was not very understanding or helpful. I'm sure this was a nice hotel 5 to 10 yrs ago but now it is just old looking. Note: The main areas are better maintained than the rooms and beds are comfortable. When they finally allowed me to switch to a 2nd floor room it was only slightly better - still fairly noisy (all though not nearly as bad) but again the room was old, worn and stained. There were also hairs in the shower of this room! I will definitely not stay here again even though the location is great, price is good and the cocktail hour and breakfast were good - cleanliness is very poor and that is much more important to me!", "Date": "August 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, NY", "Title": "\u201cA Fabulous Find\u201d", "Author": "Catullus1", "ReviewID": "UR3787994", "Content": "My wife and I are frequent domestic and international travellers who have visited LA often in recent years. After an extended cruise we just spent three thoroughly enjoyable nights at the Elan Modern and cannot be more positive in our evaluation of the establishment and its services. This is a terrific boutique-style hotel at a great location for dining, shopping, night life and just getting around LA. Our very spacious room with king size bed and large bathroom was tastefully decorated in muted tones with fixtures and furniture of Art Deco/Moderne design. A nice touch was the availability of a local restaurant listing delineated by ethnicity, location and price, complemented by an abundance of recent periodicals reviewing current tourist attractions and museum shows, as well as additional dining and shopping possibilities. Bedroom and bathroom linens and toiletries were of the highest caliber and a DSL connection (which we did not need on this occasion) was available in the room, while internet access (which I did use) and a printer (handy for keeping directions to the Getty and other tourist attractions) were available in the lobby's business center/lounge. The hotel's clientele was quite diverse: straight couples, gay couples, business people and singles. With West Hollywood nearby the hotel was clearly gay-friendly. Valet parking was swift and efficient ($14.50 per 24 hrs.), with its own underground garage which minimized waiting time (almost none). The included continental breakfast was a cornucopia of choices: hot and cold beverages, fruit, cereals, eggs (hard boiled), toast and muffins. The services of the front desk and the housekeeping staff could not have been more friendly, welcoming, courteous and helpful. The management of the Elan Modern clearly understands the tastes and needs of its clientele and delivers the goods. This a a fabulous find!

It was within walking distance of the Cedars-Sinai Hospital complex and the decorating district on Beverly, and within a short drive to Hollywood, Sunset Blvd, and La Brea. The styling inside and out is a delightful modern version of the late 1950s-early 1960s. The accomodations are all one needs, with an emphasis on privacy. Continental breakfast was delicious, and the staff was both friendly and accommodating. The facade is modest and inconspicuous, and is thus a perfect spot for one seeking to be in town without a lot of attention. Evidently, Matt Damon selects the property for that quality, and I would agree. Prices are reasonable, esp. for LA. My expectations are simple, and set low by too many nights in hotel rooms that all appear the same, down to the TV remote. This hotel will make you comfortable, not cost you too much, and you will feel you are in a memorable place.

The hotel is pretty small, and although they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve updated the place to give it a hip vibe, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still pretty easy to discern that the building itself is getting on in years. When we were greeted promptly at the curb by a friendly valet, however, and then by the professional front desk staff, our minds were soon put at ease. Although our deluxe king room was on the small side, it was quiet, clean, and comfortable. The somewhat overwrought d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public areas thankfully did not extend to the rooms which were still modern in design but more subdued. Even though our room was facing Beverly Boulevard, we were not kept awake by traffic noise save for an occasional siren (the hotel is a few blocks from Cedars Sinai Medical Center) which I doubt even the best soundproofing technology could have stifled. Linens were of high quality and soft; bed was firm. The closet comes with lots of shelf space which was so useful! Could hear some occasional chatter coming from an adjoining room but nothing too disrupting. Bathroom was small but adequate\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor some reason we seemed to have problems with water splashing up and pooling on the basin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s countertop. The lobby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retro-modern design came across as a bit cold and echoey; carpeting would have helped. The floor-to-ceiling windows were compelling but offered little more than a view of the Taco Bell across the street. The continental breakfast served in the lobby was akin to what you might get at a Hampton or Best Western which, for us, was preferable to gorging on pancakes and eggs every morning anyway. Free internet access in the small business center right off the lobby was handy for checking e-mail or printing boarding passes. The elevator was slow and a little crude. Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hallways were a bit dark and narrow. The location of the Elan is good. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small size makes stepping out of your room and going places a snap, unlike larger hotels which sometime require an act of Congress just to reunite you with your car again. Beverly Center shopping and restaurants are only a 2 or 3 block walk away. Several other decent restaurants were within walking distance. There is also a huge Rexall drug store a block away for all those items you forgot to bring with you on your trip. Beverly Hills, CBS studios, and all the Hollywood attractions are a 5-minute drive\u00e2\u20ac\u201d10 minutes tops. My companion and I did manage to walk to West Hollywood from the hotel, which is quite a trek but manageable if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re up to it. (I suggest taking Beverly to Robertson rather than walking straight up La Cienega to Santa Monica Boulevard should you decide to walk it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shorter and a much more pleasant stroll.) All in all, once we got past the facility\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s age and some of the cheesy d\u00c3\u00a9cor, we really liked the Elan. Service and amenities alone made our stay a good deal for the money.

I was lucky -- I had a room toward the back of the hotel on the second floor, which was ultra quiet.

But behind the worst-of-the-sixties architecture lies a little gem of a hotel with a level of service and the kind of personal touches usually reserved for the most expensive upscale chains. The hotel plays subtly on that sixties look throughout its very 21st century operation: the reception staff are dressed in fawn suits and crew neck sweaters; the lobby is furnished in modern retro; even the name evokes the era of Englebert Humperdinck and Frankie Vaughn. The rooms are a real pleasure. There are only about 20 of them, on two floors, and they are furnished in relaxing creams and browns. Toiletries are top quality, and are presented pocketed in folded towels. A dressing gown hangs on the bathroom door. There's a minibar and a stock of snacks, but you're unlikely to go hungry, because the Elan Modern includes a buffet breakfast in the very reasonable price: cereals, eggs, bagels, muffins and yogurt without the usual $15 added to the bill. Now to what's not perfect. The rooms are centered around a little inner courtyard, and for inexplicable reasons, they leave a bright light on in the yard all night. This means your room is never dark, and in fact, I ended up hanging a bath towel over the top of the curtains to block out the glare. The obsession with bright light extends to the fitness room which is oppressively overlit; it's also pretty basic, but there's a proper gym just along the road if you want a more extensive selection of kit. Despite the irritations this hotel is hard to beat, whether you're a tourist or business traveller. The attractions of Beverley Hills - the shops of Rodeo Drive and the bars and restaurants of Santa Monica Boulevard - are just minutes away, and it's a short drive to the Hollywood hills and the film studios which are a must see for every tourist.
