Very convenient location, close to the train station, walking distance, but just 1 stop on the tram. The tram stop is just opposite the hotel. We arrived at about 11am, but our room was ready so able to check in. We'd taken an overnight ferry from England, and just having the 1 night in Amsterdam it was good that we could check in straight away and leave our bags, so we could maximise our time in the city. The room was lovely. I was staying with my wife and her 23 year old daughter (visiting us from the US), so we had a 3 person room. This consisted of 2 single beds pushed together, with a 3rd single bed in a corner of the room behind a screen. Large screen TV which even had BBC channels, not that we were watching much TV. It was a sizable room, and we felt we had enough privacy. The bathroom was a little strange with a glass door (partly frosted), but well equipped and a vet good and sizable shower cubicle. The following morning we could leave our bags in a secure store room whilst we explored more of the city, and then pick them up before heading the short distance back to the station. You can book breakfast the day before for a discount but we preferred to venture out and find a pancake house! Down the side street across the road is an excellent bar called \"In De Wildeman\", highly recommended if you are a beer aficionado, carrying various draught beers from around the world and a wide range of bottles. The hotel is a short walk from the red light district, and many coffee shops in the vicinity. Much of the city is within walking distance, but a visitor tram ticket (1 to 5 days I think, we got a 2 day ticket for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12) is worth getting and then you can get a little closer.

The room was very small and the bathroom was separated by glass only, that requires some good level of closeness with your roommate... But then again, I would have found it a good deal if we were paying half the price. The double bed was made by two separate matrasses and separate blanketts and linen.

Having stayed at several other local hotels too, put simply... in my opinion the Westcord is hands down the best place to stay in the central amsterdam area. Great location and not too long a walk from central station (so not too many a cobbled streets for the poor wheels of my suitcase to have to contend with) all whilst within easy walking distance of several Coffeeshops, Shops / Stores, Places to eat and easily accessible tram stops to get you wherever you need to go in the city. There's some great nightlife spots nearby too. The staff are always brilliant and helpful, even when strolling in during the early hours in the morning after a night out, you'll always get a smile and hello from the person on reception. They majority of times i check in on my various trips i always seem to have been served by the same lady (she's actually photographed on this site holding the phone to her ear) to the point where now i'm immediately recognized as soon as i stroll through those reception doors and she always immediately greets me with a fond hello, smile and a 'welcome back sir'. As for the rooms themselves, every one i've stayed in has had a comfortable bed, always in very clean condition and unlike other hotels nearby, the walk to the room does not involve a lot of walking within the hotel due to its straightforward layout. The showers in the trendy ensuites are simply divine, and for me personally a good shower is the mark of a good hotel. Room service always does a good job cleaning the room and never have i had any items go missing (even though i tend to leave my laptop / ipod and associated bits and pieces lying around on my desk while i am out). I tend to stay in the Deluxe rooms which has a functional secure safe in the room with a digital keypad if required as well as air conditioning. Flat screen tv's mounted on the wall in these rooms too easily watchable from bed, plus with free wifi available in the rooms and downstairs in reception, why would you want to stay anywhere else.

I'm slightly loathed to write this review as it may become a bit too popular, but they do deserve my recommendation, so here goes. First of all the good things. The location is excellent. It's a short walk away from Central Station and really well connected. There's a tram stop just outside and 2 bike rental companies just round the corner (the Yellow Bike company in front, and White Bike behind). A hot tip (for any newbies to the City) is to get the train from the airport to Central Station and walk to the hotel. Use a map if you're unsure, but as long as you go to the right-most exit from the station, you'll be just 5 minutes from your room! The rooms are small..just enough for one, probably two if you're an intimate couple. I always get the \"deluxe\" rooms which are modern and funky. Be warned that the bathroom is a frosted glass cubicle, so you'll have to be comfy with your partner possibly \"enjoying\" the view! By Amsterdam standards though, they are fine and very clean. One of the annoying things about the rooms is the location of the light switches: they are on the headboard, so if you lay in bed watching telly or reading a book, you'll find yourself playing disco-lights accidentally! ... I've never got used to this (the designer should be rudely told off! ;) ) The other potentially annoying thing is the sound of the council trucks cleaning up in the morning: it pays to get a high-up room to avoid the traffic noise (it is a city after all). The other thing I've enjoyed about this place is the staff. They aren't hugely outgoing or overtly try to help, just very normal and friendly and cosily, unfussily welcoming. Peter has been there for a while now, and I often see the same faces which is nice. Like any place, if you smile, they smile back :) The hotel is easy walking distance to the main attractions: the Flower Market, Leidseplein (a little further), Dam Square, and the Red Light district. If you fancy something different, one of my favourite times was hiring a bike; taking the cheap ferry (the other side of the station) across to the North and cycling around all the pretty (old fashioned) dutch dwellings alongside the canals: it's a much quieter and calmer experience than the usual and recommended on any sunny day. Back to the locality: right outside the back is a smaller red-light area that I prefer to the main drag: it's more humane; a little more for the locals (although in recent years seems to have become less so). You'll find the beautiful Martine: star of the film \"Ouwehoeren\" there and many other more friendly ladies. If you cut across the shopping streets, you can get to the main red-light area for a wander round. Also to the back (west side) there are some very lovely streets with boutique shops including some nice art shops and cafes, etc: a very pleasant stroll for window shopping or people watching. One time there was an outdoor festival here: just on the canalside - it's the kind of thing that makes Amsterdam a special place and seems to happen quite often (maybe they do it just for me?) Again, more locally there is a gay cinema round the back of the hotel and some nice restaurants and a gay bar too (\"Prik\": the names are always amusing to us English speakers!). Also, there's a great music/nightclub just round the back called \"Bitterzoet\": again one of my favourites (if you're feeling young, fresh and funky, check it out). Back on the gay theme, just over the road is purportedly the largest dark-room in Europe..in the Cuckoos Nest: a gay cruise bar with a downstairs dark area, and for more cruising, there's a fun place on the main Damrak which is a cinema with a viewing/cruising area upstairs. They play loud banging music, so if you're bored and want to sit and watch gay porn with your ears pounded it's great. Finally, if you're really bored, you might be lucky enough to have one of the rooms overlooking one of the red-light windows; in which case you can while away any downtime watching what goes on: it's a fascinating sociological study, but not anywhere near as interesting as it might sound, but it does at least beat 24 hour CNN if you want a few hours inside.

My compliments to the Housekeeping staff as they replenished and cleaned our room daily with the same high standard. We did not have breakfast i the hotel as there are some great places to grab breakfast in Amsterdam, however it did look appetising. The only problem i had was with the front desk staff, We arrived around 11am, and asked politely if we could check in, which to our delight was no problem. It just felt like the checkin was rushed, the gentleman explained the facilities so fast that i barely understood him. he also told us to come back later for any more info about the city? we had no opportunity to ask about anything else.

It is centraly located from the square and the ferry terminal.We were able to walk to most tourists attractions such as Anne Frank's house. As for the hotel itself, it was a good value. We had a superior room on the third room which was bigger than our friend's room on the 5th floor (they had a star room). Although the room is small in comparison to American standards, for a European room we had amble space. There was enough space to walk around the beds and have to lay out a 30in and 25 in suite case on the floor. There are a few things to note about the room: * Make sure you get a superior room. Our friends had a \"star\" room and that was small. Not even enough room to walk around the bed. * There is construction still going on and if you want to sleep in past 9am or take a nap during the day it can be very disruptive. Ask for a room higher up as I think the construction is on the 1st floor (but than again my friends on the 5th floor could here it as well). *The walls of the bathroom are made of glass with some frosted parts to allow for some privacy (although the one place you would want frosted wasn't.. the glass in front of the toliet had a badly placed swirl design.. akward). *Our bed wasn't a true full, but instead two twin beds pushed up together.

What do you want me to do about it?\" The manager eventually came and we checked in - eventually at 4.40pm. Got to the room on the 3rd floor and it was at first glance, ok. But on closer inspection, we found used condom wrappers under the bed, smoking paraphernalia in a drawer and it hadn't been hoovered. The bed was lumpy and the ensuite left a lot to be desired. It had zero privacy with glass walls. The room was so hot too, with the non adjustable heating on full. The window would only open 1cm or so. Eventually left the hotel and explored the city.. Getting back to the hotel (which is in Amsterdams second redlight area which isn't as safe or secure as the main one) we went to the hotel bar. Beers are about \u00c2\u00a36 and wine \u00c2\u00a38...

It paid off bigtime because it was one of the hotels my husband and I loved most on our European getaway in May 2011. True to European form, the room was small and would be difficult for those with loads of luggage. But we only had two dufflebags, so it worked great for us! Even with the room being small, it had a smart layout-- the foot of the bed was pressed up against the wall under the wall-mounted tv, with the desk placed just behind the headboard. Hard to picture? Just check out the photos I included with this post and you will see what I mean. It was really neat! :-) I travel a ton for work and have become a bit of a hotel snob over the years-- accommodations that are very clean, super comfy, and a little on the luxurious side are important to me, and yet I don't like to spend a lot of money on a hotel stay either. It makes for a tough combination to find such accommodations in Europe but I feel that this hotel fit the bill! The shower was one of the BEST we had on the trip-- a seemingly limitless supply of hot water and the water pressure was excellent! Really nice. The only thing I will say is that the toilet was really close to the shower stall and sink, so I can imagine it would be difficult for really heavy-set people or the elderly who don't get around too well-- for us, it wasn't a problem at all though. The glass windows were a unique touch in the bathroom but might be a little awkward for people sharing a room that are super modest or don't know each other as well. That said, they have it perfectly glazed in all the right spots, so the most someone will see of you is your feet and, if you are tall, maybe the top of your head-- otherwise, you are covered. It does make you feel a little exposed though since I suppose someone \"could\" see you if they squatted down and peered under the glazed part (through the clear part of the glass) while you were showering or using the toilet. If you travel with weirdos who you think might do that though, I'd recommend re-thinking your travel companions! HA! Again, this wasn't an issue for us as a longtime married couple, but something I thought I should mention. The bed was super comfy and the room temp quite comfortable. We were there in late May when it was still cool outside, so I can't speak for how it might be in the dead of summer, but the room temp was great during our stay. The location of the hotel was soooo ideal and my husband even commented that he really appreciated that I found a hotel in Amsterdam with such a great location. We felt safe there even when walking around at night and it was fantastic to be in walking distance of all of the main sites and in close walking distance to the bus/rail station. Really awesome! We also had some great pastry shops in the area for breakfast and there is no shortage of great little cafes and restaurants close by (and throughout Amsterdam) for lunch and dinner. The biggest issue for me in Amsterdam was the rank smell of reefer that is everywhere in that city, but Amsterdam has that reputation for a reason so I expected it. I was just grateful that our non-smoking room didn't have that smell or any hint of cigarette smoke-- I was definitely happy about that and it lent to the nice stay we had, for sure. :-) If you are looking for comfort, cleanliness, a nice hot shower with good water pressure, a comfy bed, non-smoking rooms, a great location in walking distance to the main attractions, and a good price, this is the hotel for you. If you plan to bring loads of luggage though, there won't be room, but most savvy European travelers know better than that anyway. Just pack three or four outfits and do laundry half-way through the trip and keep your load light and you'll have a MUCH better travel experience.

Got recommanded from a friend who stayed in their other hotel a bit further from the city centre earlier this year. Checked their photos with the rooms which look clean and modern, thought the price was fair and paid 468 euros for our 3 nights stay in October. Upon arrival and saw the real room we got--> SHOCKING! A total false advertising... Okay, we've chosen to book the \"standard comfort\" type rooms, but we surely did not expect to stay in an \"entirely different world\" from most of the other hotel guests. The room is so tiny, with stinky old carpets and old bathrooms like a 2-stars drive in motel. Nothing is close to their pictures shown online, not even their NON superior room but standard room photos. There was this huge crack on the shower head which means there was like a water stream shooting out in another direction, flooding the bathroom everytime after a shower. Worse thing is yes, we got a room not facing the streets so we didn't have the noise problem, but then its like sleeping in a public toliet every night because of the smell coming out from the pipes running down probably from all the other rooms near the courtyard. We asked the reception if we can PAY and upgrade to another room immediately, and was told the hotel was fully booked. Checked the next night again and was told they could not quote a price for us unless we packed up and checkout the following afternoon and tried to check-in again...we had no time to risk with the price so we did not upgrade at last. There were no where what so ever mentioned on their website by paying like 10 or 20 euro less from their SUPERIOR room means u have to stay on their STILL RENORVATING dodgy first floor. Finally, talking about service, the towels never got changed until asked, we did the usual by putting the used towels away and NOT on the racks -->meaning they would like to be changed, all we found when we got back was a pile of dirty towels chucked on the bathtop... we have to called the reception or bumped onto one of the housekeepings to get clean towels...

Why? Location This was my first visit to Amsterdam so I had no clue where anything was (I had limited time to do proper research). This hotel is PERFECT, it is a maximum 10 minute walk to the Central Station that takes you to the airport (and has a great bike rental place, I forget the name but it's the one right at the end of the station (to the right as you are facing it - look for the red bikes!). If you walk down one of the main roads from Central station it is very seedy and loud, but the road that this hotel was on was much quieter, with a few places to grab breafast. It was at least \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12 for breakfast at the hotel so we didn't bother with this - although the restaurant area looked perfectly nice. Amsterdam is such a small city that I strongly recommend hiring bikes to see the whole city in one day. I wasn't that keen at first but was so glad my friends thought to do it. Everywhere is flat and there are huge cycle lanes so you can avoid traffic. Ah I remember, Mac's bikes - they were really smooth to ride, I was surprised how little effort it took to zoom around. Other than that you can walk EVERWHERE, we walked from the hotel down to Anne Frank's house. From the hotel to the markets, the red light district etc etc. The Room The room was compact and as other people have said has a very different design. But that doesn't make it bad! I loved it, it was very modern, very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. As for the bathroom, the walls are indeed made of glass, with a frosted strip going around the middle. So you can't see the person inside the bathroom unless you stand really close and peer over the strip on your tip toes. However, I don't think I would have been too happy to use the toilet etc with anyone other than my partner. The Service Check in was a breeze and when we checked out in the morning we were given receipts for our luggage and they were kept in an office until we were ready to leave Amsterdam.

The window opens to let in fresh air, we have no view but that is fine and also means absolutely no street noise. There is a choice of street or back of building, we chose back for peace and quiet. The beds are two singles made up separately but pushed together. I do not know if a non couple can get beds apart. They are very comfortable and lovely and clean with two pillows.

Though there were several differences from my expectations, overall the hotel was okay especially with no emotional conflict which becomes maybe more important in remembering on hotel. However, the room itself was different from expectation on several points, as follows. <Weak points> 1. Very small twin beds : It was really twin beds, though the two beds are stick together and each bed size was much smaller than single bed, The width of one bed though I didn't measure, seems to be less than 80 centimemters. Combined two bed sizes seems to be just same as one double bed size. The room itself is very small. 2. Glass walls of bath room : Though it is coated glass walls, it is not completely coated. The bath room walls, just 50 centimeter away from the twin bed, are made of glass, through which inside of bathroom are seen. This can be very embarrassing unless one person stays. Sitting on the toilet tub can be also seen from outside of bathroom through the glass, which is most embarrassing. It can be embarrassing even it is couple. I had to use the bathroom with no light in darkness to minimize the problem. 3. No refrigerator : It maybe my mistatke that I didn't check about this. I just assmed there would be small refrigerator, but there wasn't. Instead, there was coffee pot. Without it, it is inconvenient to drink cool water and to store some food for days. (I know from past experiences, in European countries, many hotel rooms didn't have refrigerator.) 4. Poor cleaning : Though the beds are clean and neat, I could see dust as it is on the desk, bed top, and bathroom sink. The sink in the bathroom is of glass and modern, so it looked very clean at apprearance, but sitting on the toilet tub, due to its closeness, you could see the dust as it is on the sink. Overall room facilities are modern and clean, but cleaning was poor. 5. Card to operate the lift : Security was good so that you should first activate the lift by room card. However, the card was not well recognized so I had to try at least several times, inserting and pulling. <Good points> 1. Location : The locations is between central station and dam square. By walking from central station, 10 minutes distance. From central stations, you have to cross streets for trams, cars, bikes, canals, rather complex surroundings to arrive the street of hotel. Then it takes 5 minutes from the hotel street. Near dam square, there was very good food market and also Anne Frank house was nearby. 2. Coffee pot : This was actually very useful. Not only coffee but soups, you could have only with this. Coffee and teas were always provided kindly. 3. Wifi : (Though we chose this hotel due to this, we didn't use in fact.) 4. Others : Airconditioning was proper and overall the room was clean with modern interior and not noisy.

If you stay out by the airport there are few options for eating other than the hotel and there is nothing to do. The city center is a short and easy 20 minute train ride. I reserved a single room. The room itself was very tiny with a single bed, but tastefully furnished, modern and comfortable. I was given a deluxe room that came with free wireless, kettle with tea and instant coffee and a very modern bathroom. The bathroom was glassed in with the lower parts frosted. Since it was a single room, privacy wasn't an issue. The sink was made of glass. Not really liking single beds, I have to admit that it was very comfortable and I slept very well. The room is air conditioned, but I didn't need it. My room faced a quiet street, but it would be nice to have the a/c in the summer when the weather does get warmer. I was asked if I wanted to pre-purchase breakfast when I checked in, but I opted against it. If you are a breakfast eater, it will save you money if your pre-purchase breakfast.

The hotel is close to a large Albert Heijn Supermarket as well as a smaller one. It's a great place to get drinks, sandwiches, snacks, and souvenirs. There a large number of restaurants close by including a number of middle eastern fast food places where you can get a delicious shawarma.

We stayed at the WestCord City Centre Hotel for one miserable, sleepless night (original reservation for 3 nights), booking through hotels.com. The room the hotel gave us was disgusting - the carpet had dozens of unidentifiable filthy stains, the bathroom was moldy and dirty, and there was a repetitive, constant noise coming from somewhere outside the paper-thin walls of our room, which we believe originated from the elevator. And we're not referring to the little dinging noise that lets you know the elevator has arrived. We're talking about a shrill, roaring, squealing and creaking noise of the elevator moving in the shaft. We weren't even next door to the elevator. We complained to the front desk and they offered to transfer us to another room down the hall that was even worse. The hotel staff also pretended the hotel did not have severe noise problems, even after another guest overheard our story, and said she too was bothered by the horrible creaking noises in her room. The best part was the hotel staff blamed the noise on the construction going on next door, which we (luckily) did not hear. Best wishes to those guests who had to deal with that, too. We consulted with the Front Office Manager Yoeri Spruyt and were told that that we would be refunded the 2 nights of the reservation so we thought it would be all right to go ahead and check out. When we arrived back home, we called the hotel to confirm our refund, and spoke with Yoeri who quickly transferred us to his irrational and irate manager, Shai. Shai angrily informed us that we would not be refunded our money under any circumstances. He and Yoeri lied and said Yoeri never stated we would be refunded, which statements we relied on in checking out. These lies resulted in us paying for two hotels the rest of our stay (the one we transferred to in addition to the filthy, noisy WestCord). And at the very least, if they had told us we were not getting our money back (which they absolutely did not) and we still made the decision to leave after not being able to locate a room without noise, we never would have told them we were checking out early -- why should this hotel receive the windfall of being able to rebook the room AND not return our money?! After arguing for 15 minutes, we told him that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d make sure to write a review with an accurate account of our awful experience at this hotel and its customer \"service\" and he threatened to sue us (no joke!).

The bathroom, with the famous-unfamous glass door (that is not completely clear), was also quite small and had a shower.Wifi connection in the room and public areas is free, there is also a computer at the lobby that can be used for free.Did not have breakfast at the hotel, it was priced 15 Euros. I went to a place close by, but payed for a full american breakfast with coffee and fresh orange juice the same price as the hotel's one. But I guess there are other choices, it also depends if you're looking for a plain continental breakfast.The hotel's location is really good, it is located between central station and dam square, but it's out from the hustle and bustle area.I really suggest this hotel for a week end in Amsterdam", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Italy", "Title": "\u201cComfy room and great location\u201d", "Author": "black_miccia", "ReviewID": "UR88013305", "Content": "Like what others mentioned in the previous review, this hotel has a great location.

The bed was comfortable, the sheet was clean and changed everyday. The headboard was a little but dusty but the rest of the room was very clean. Even though we were staying in the room with a street view but at night it was quite. So we had no problem to have a good night sleep. We didn't have our breakfast in the hotel because of the choices outside of the hotel were better with less price. Don't be surprise with the \"strange\" smell in the lift and corridor. With red light district only one step ahead, there were people who prefer to enjoyed it at the hotel room. One minus thing was the female receptionist were not as friendly as the male receptionist. They did our checked out without any hotelier attitude. No smile and not even one question about how was our stay. I can understand if it was hectic in the lobby but it wasn't.

We were asked if we would like to pre-order breakfast at 15 euros, but kindly declined as the pub next to the hotel were doing breakfast at 8 euros per person. Got back to the hotel around 3:30pm and we were allocated a room on the 5th floor, this is when the problems began with this hotel. We booked this hotel through expedia which clearly stated it was a twin room. But the room was a non-separable double bed frame, with 2 single mattresses on top. I spoke to reception but they said the room was a twin room. I told them this was not a twin room, as I have stayed in other hotels with twin rooms, and told them they have 2 separate beds in them, but the staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be bothered. The next major problem in this room was the bathroom, what was this hotel company thinking? Clear glass with some frosted glass mid-way up. Again this created problems, as when one person was in the bathroom, it was a little unpleasant to be able to hear everything and have to turn your gaze in another direction when the person you have booked the hotel room with was taking care of business in the bathroom. The hotel wifi was beyond a joke. I went down to reception to query this problem, as I was trying to check in for a flight, but the airline website would take an eternity to load. The member of staff on reception said this about it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a 3 star hotel, next time book a 4 star hotel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I found this comment to be ridiculous, as if you are going to provide a service provide a proper one, or just direct the hotel resident to a local internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 instead of being rude and flippant about it. The hotel beds were very soft, managed to get a decent amount of sleep, but were grateful I was only spending 1 night in this room. I found the room to be very small and what an estate agent would probably describe as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153compact\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hardly an room at all for 2 occupants. Coming downstairs in the hotel in the morning I was greeted to stains of vomit (at 09:45) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c surely the hotel could clean this up bearing in mind there was only 2 lifts in this hotel and the stairs seemed to be very popular. Went to the local pub for breakfast (forget the name) and on way back I am glad I did as I had a quick look to see what the hotel was serving for breakfast, and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look inspiring. Overall, would I stay at this hotel again? NO! for \u00c2\u00a3100 a night its not like I am booking into a budget hotel, and polite staff would go a long way, decent internet connections would be ideal, as I found myself going to an internet caf\u00c3\u00a9. And for staff to make sure stairs are clean would be good (vomit stains are not what I call a good impression). So to sum up, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here again as I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like people seeing what I am doing in the bathroom, staff speaking to guests in a rude manner and having to avoid vomit stains on stairs and sleeping in a box room, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend this hotel for the money they charge for a room.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat place in heart of city\u201d", "Author": "i-Luv-Travelgd", "ReviewID": "UR86917849", "Content": "Really enjoyed this spot.

First impressions- excellent location, 5 mins walk from amsterdam central station, right along a main tram line- so easy access to the rest of the city. The hotel lobby itself was very stylish, staff were polite & considerate. This was costing us ~130 euros for a twin room deluxe per night- so i did expect it to be much nicer than the previous places i'd been in. The room however was a bit of a let down- since we were on a corner- our room was a weird L shape which made it seem quite cramped- bear in mind that we went for a deluxe and not a standard room. The decor itself was very nice, modern fittings + small flat screen on the wall. Now my 2 biggest complaints about the room was firstly the bed- our twin room consisted of 2 VERY small single mattresses side by side (we actually had to call reception to check this was a twin room). The other complaint was that they had opted for a glass door for the bathroom. Now part of the glass was tinted- but considering this is NOT a room for couples- someone should have realised that possibly you don't want to see your friends showering or sitting on the toilet?!?! (am i a prude???) In summary- excellent location, fancy decor. But the deluxe room didn't seem amazing value for money and felt cramped and the bathroom situation left quite a lot to be desired.....

On booking the hotel, which stated rooms with bath or shower and twin or double bed, we emailed the hotel directly to request (a) a room with double bed and bath and also (b) an early check-in room, as our flights arrived in Amsterdam at approx 9.15am, so with luggage reclaim, train etc we anticipated arriving at the hotel at approx 11am. We received no reply from our requests so again emailed asking the same; we received a reply stating that we had booked a delux room - which do not have baths, and that as the hotel was full the night before they did not think we could have an early check-in room but would try to accomodate us if they could. The hotel is a short walk from the station (cost of train is 3.70 euros pp each way) and very easy to get to, even with pushing a wheelchair and carrying luggage. On arrival we did find that our room was not yet ready, but where offered to leave luggage there until we could get into our room. We had a wander around the nearby shopping area stopping for some early lunch before heading back, at about 2pm to be handed our room key straight away. The male receptionist was very helpful and friendly, offering us information on the city, however as it was our 5th visit to Amsterdam we had our schedule sorted out. He told us to just ask if we wanted/required anything. Our room (401) was on the 4th floor, and the first room next to the lift, and while the location was good, not only could we here the people in and out of the lift, plus the lift workings (working all night!). The room is a very strange configuration - as we opened the door we were greeted by a desk, with 2 transparrent plastic chairs; directly behind the desk was the bed, whch was 2 single beds - made as singles, not as a double as is usual on the continent - but together, with the end of the bed against the wall, with the tv mounted on the wall, just above the bed; that wall was carpeted, and whilst it looked strange and felt a very clostophobic area, it worked to give access to both sides of the bed. The bathroom, as previously mentioned is seperated from the main bedroom area by a glass door, with just a frosted panel in the middle and clear glass at top and bottom, the door opens either way and does not shut firm. In the bathroom, there is a toilet, glassed sink, and a shower with large rain shower power head, in a glass cubicle. There was also a hairdryer, the usual hotel type , attached to the wall. There are ammenities provided but these are only soap and body lotion (and shower cap) not any shower gel or shampoo, which would be more useful - especially as we did not bring any as we were travelling with hand luggage only, and expected it to be provided as we had read that toiletries were provided. There was a small wardrobe/storage area, however if you were spending more than 2 or 3 nights there the space would not be enough to unpack and store clothing. In the wardrobe area there was a free electronic safe, and in one of the drawers of the desk was a tray with tea/coffee cups and kettle. We did not have breakfast at the hotel so cannot comment - only to add should you wish, breakfast costs 15 euros per person. The hotel is in easy reach of most parts of the city, and with a tram stop outside the front door of the hotel, it is in a good location, just one word of warning though, just around the corner of the hotel are some 'windows' which are part of the Singel RLD area, and this continues to the rear of the hotel - wasnt a problem for us as we knew about it from previous visits, but just so you are aware should you be easily offended. All in all we enjoyed our stay, and after becoming accustomed to the set out of the room we were actually very comfortable. Especially on the second night, as we had asked for extra towels to help me in the shower, and they provided a shower seat plus the extra towels. There was room for my wheelchair in the room, but not around the room, and the hotel was accessable.

When we got in the room, we were quite impress by the nice modern and optimal decorations and furnitures and It looked like we got what we wanted but we soon found out that the double bed was more a pair of single beds and each one had its own set of sheets wich cause something I really hate when I expect a good night with my partner, a phisical and uncomfortable frontier gab between the beds. A real bummer to me and I still hated it two days later. So Westcord, real double beds please! The other annoying thing is that the wall isolating the toilets/shower room from the bedroom is made of... glass ! there is only a white translucent sticker covering the window from knee height to shoulder height for a make-believe privacy. If, like me, you do not enjoy being smelt, heard or seen while you do your daily thing, this is quite an issue as well.

The floor to ceiling windows let in plenty of light, most of it electric, but I am an easy sleeper so I didn't mind. The lighting inside the room is not very practical. The television was of good quality and the bathroom was small and basic. It was not a room one would enjoy hanging out it but for what I paid (90 or 95 Euro), I can't complain. The location is awesome - a quick walk from Centraal station and to anywhere in the city centre. The price (for Europe) was acceptable and considering it was just for a night, it was more than adequate.", "Date": "March 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cCLEAN HOTEL IN EXCELLENT LOCATION\u201d", "Author": "Stacey1982", "ReviewID": "UR55105088", "Content": "We got to Central Station and headed to the right in order to get to the hotel. I would say it is a 5-10min walk. We got to the hotel about 10.30am and went to reception to ask if we could leave our bags there. The receptionist advised that our room was ready so we were able to check in which we were happy with. The receptionist took my credit card details and gave us the room key along with a map. We were in room 503 which was a deluxe room. The room is nicely decorated but is very small however it isnt much of a problem as we were not there to stay in the room all day. As you walk into the room, the bathroom is to the left which is sectioned off by frosted glass which does not offer much privacy however if you are sharing with a partner it shouldnt matter too much. The bathroom was very clean and the shower was nice and hot. The foot of the bed was against the wall with the head of the bed having a table and 2 chairs against it. The broadband is free in the duluxe room however I did not use this. There was a flat screen TV on the wall which had a few English speaking channels on there such as BBC 1 and 2 along with CNN. The bed was comfortable with lovely pillows. The room took a while to warm up however it was very cold outside as it was snowing. The only real negative thing I can say about the room was that there was a musty smell in there which then got into your clothes. and the cleaners start very early and you can hear them knocking around. If you leave the DO NOT DISTURB sign up, they will not knock on your door however you can hear them knocking on other peoples doors! Also, it does state that of you do not take the sign down by 12.30pm, your room will not be cleaned. We took ours down after this time and came back to a clean room which was a bonus. We did not pay for the breakfast as I think 15 Euros per person is a bit much. Dam Square was straight across the road through some walkways - only about a 5 - 10 minute walk. We caught the number 16 tram to heineken museum which was about a 10 minute ride and the cost to get in was 15 Euros and I would recommend going there as we spent a good few hours in there.

Also within walking distance is Dam Square where they have a nice little coffee shop called 'Coffee Company' and lots of beautiful historical buildings. Also worth checking out in the area is Magna Plaza Shopping Centre, what a lovely building! The only complaint I had about this hotel is that both mornings, I was woken up early by the VERY loud cleaner cleaning the room next door.

The location was excellent! It was 5 minute walk from the Central Station trainstop and within walking distance to a majority of the tourist sites.

We got the deluxe room which has free internet and A/C though we could not get the internet to work. The deluxe room had gone thru renovations so this seemed to be newer than the non deluxe. This was partly due to the laptop we had was borrowed from somone locally and was in German so we had a difficult time translating things. Beware that the bathroom offers little privacy as the walls are partly glass and frosted in the middle sections so that someone laying in bed can see the other person using the toilet. Toilet is also in a very narrow space between the wall and side of the glass shower. So if you are not a slim person, you will have a tight squeeze to sit down. The shower was nice size and had very hot water that almost can be scalding. Interesting clear glass sink and table top. Down side is there was no storage space to spread out your toiletries. The bed appeared to be queen size but like many European beds, there are 2 mattresses so there is a gap running between the 2. The room has a wall safe but no minibar. The A/C worked very well and unlike the hotels in Germany which seemed to run warm. The weather was not hot but having the A/C run helped to remove stale air and any humidity in the room. One thing I did not notice until the end of our trip was that out the back entrance of the hotel, there were 2 red light booths next to the hotel in addition to a gay video store.

Nice hotel with an excellent location. Located in the heart of amsterdam just a short walk from Dam Square and the Damrak. We chose a deluxe room and paid for this through ebookers. Due to booking a deluxe room on this website we had to pay a non refundable price for the hotel but this suited us fine. Upon arrival we were offered a deluxe room to the front or the back of the hotel. The front looks onto the main street with trams and restuarants etc and to the back a quieter street but quite dark almost so we chose the front and we were not disappointed. I found Amsterdam relatively quiet and we were told this was much to do with the recession. There was barely a person on the street at the front of the hotel after midnight and the trams were not noisey and could not be heard through the windows. We were room 214 (2nd floor). Yes the rooms are compact but if you are only here for 3 nights like we were this was not an issue. They were clean, modern, comfortable and trendy with a nice plasma screen. Not a huge amount of wardrobe space. The bathrooms are glass boxed cubes and yes, if you were here with someone you had only just started dating or with a work colleague this would be a definite no no. Although frosted in parts, the door is glass, the walls are glass and the door has an inch gap the whole way round so you can literally see and hear everything. This was no problem for my fiance and i however. Shower is excellent - big, powerful and very roomy! We got maid service every day. We chose not to take the hotel breakfast as at 15 euros a pop we felt it expensive. Amsterdam itself is very pricey!!! We now realise that this is not because everything is over priced in amsterdam but just due to the pound being soooo bad. Our money just flew away!! Seriously. Went there for 4 days and spent \u00c2\u00a3500!! Drinks are thorugh the roof with 2 pints of beer/lager being 10 euros (which is more like \u00c2\u00a310 nowadays). Outrageous! Food was expensive also with a main course in a simple restaurant, nothing fancy at all, being 15-17 euros. We were even charged 7 euros for a coca cola in one mediocre restaurant. However, all that aside, i have to say i had the best 4 days and i wouldnt change a thing from the hotel, location, people, bars etc. I am just sad to be home!

The wardrobe was small too, but again has all the room you need, as long as you left the ball gowns at home. I thought the glass bathrooms were amusing, and we partly booked the hotel due to these, just for a giggle. Air conditioning was a pretty powerful split unit and more than adequate. Its fan speeds and louvre (if requested) were effective and I found the whole experience to be thermostatically accurate. It made a slight hum, but they do though don't they, air conditioning units. The twin rooms (or at least six of them) are split matress doubles, but are pretty large, have a very good matress and two single douvets. It was no problem. No one ate breakfast in the hotel. There are a myriad of early morning eateries outside, from traditional Dutch to somewhere to get a bacon roll. For this reason all I can say is you can have breakfast at the hotel if you want.

The work is to convert the standard rooms to star / superior rooms, starting on the 3rd floor. We were staying on the 5th floor and were told we probably wouldn't be troubled too much by the noise as the construction work was taking place 2 floors away. As compensation, we were offered free full breakfast for our stay, so we thought, we'd see how it went... The Wed morning, the drilling started about 8am, and was just about barable - with the use of earplugs we bought the previous day! On Thursday morning, we were waken to the sound of blocks of debris being thrown from the fire escape a floor below, down 4 stories to a skip, then the drilling - at 7.30am! Arrgh!! Not the relaxing stay we had in mind. Even with earplugs - trying to sleep was useless. When my husband rang reception to ask what time the work is meant to start, he was told 8am. We waited until the manager started that day to complain - no refund was possible as we had booked through a pre-booking website, so we were given free tickets to the Van Gough museum, when all we wanted was a decent kip! We were moved to a room on the near side of the building, where the noise was meant to be quieter... but wasn't. As a consequence of our complaint, the work was held off until after 8am on the Thursday morning - then continued until 8pm to compensate for the late start! This put a real dampener on an othewise great choice of hotel. I have stayed at 5 hotels in Amsterdam, and this deal offered the best in terms of price, location and the star rooms are clean, modern and comortable. The full breakfast was plentiful in terms of choice for a 3 star hotel in Amsterdam and the standard good - although I did have a constuction worker trying to lean over my table by the window to pass an electricity cable through while I was eating! The rooms on the far side have a street view so good for people watching but the TVs have less choice and no pay movies. The near side rooms don't have much of a view but are slightly larger with the bed positioned right up to the wall with a mounted TV. The hotel seems to be changing from a Ramada to a Golden Tulip, so be aware of this when looking for it on the street. My simple advice about staying at this hotel? Good choice if you're stay is at the weekend when the work stops. Otherwise, think twice - I didn't expect to be looking forward to coming home from my holiday just to escape the constant banging and drilling. If you have already booked and can't cancel, request a room on the the top floor, the 6th floor which is non-smoking. At least then, you are furtheraway from the noise.", "Date": "January 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLoved the ramada Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "lou2995", "ReviewID": "UR12335073", "Content": "We stayed at the ramada from 30/12-01/01/08 we were pleasently surprised as we had got a good deal on the hotel.

So it was interesting to check in to a single \u00e2\u20ac\u0153star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room at the Ramada City Centre Amsterdam. This is a small space about 6 x7 feet with a tiny triangular annex bathroom the size one might find in a train compartment. Some interior decorator went to incredible lengths to make this tiny space look larger than it is. The carpet runs up one wall. The bunk like bed is mounted against another and a desk and small closet complete the furnishings. The desk chair is clear Mylar plastic (and very uncomfortable). The strange (and I suspect rather expensive) bathroom door is made of heavy tempered glass, and swing s out not in. The middle of the glass is frosted but the top and bottom are clear creating an effect not unlike a public restroom. It does allow light to pass through making the space a bit brighter which was probably the idea. Staying in a single room alone this is innocuous enough but if one was sharing with anything but a very intimate (and good natured) partner it would be kind of creepy. The bathroom sink and small glass surround allows no space to put anything like cosmetics or even a tooth brush. Storing cosmetics on the floor may be a bit off putting especially for the ladies who may also not like the lack of a tub..Still except for these minor issues the space actually works and is quite comfortable. Honorable mention goes to the semi circular shower which actually has doors that close, not one of those silly glass half panels that European hotels often have. The bathroom actually stays dry. The price was reasonable by local standards especially when you factor in the free wireless Internet which can cost upwards of 22 Euro a day even in some 5 star properties in Amsterdam.

One thing to note is that there is no mini bar so its a good idea to stock up upon arrival. The bathroom is A+ with a great shower and funky sink plenty of channels on the LCD and a Comfy bed. The back of the hotel shares a street with a small red light area and a Gay Cinema right next door. If your room looks onto the back street, you will cleary see the red lights, but don't let this bother you as it seemed very low key. I didnt use room service or the restaurant so unable to comment.

This did change our views and enjoyment of our stay here as the smoke seemed to seep through the walls at night and it smelled like someone was actually smoking in our room! This was definately the worse part for us. The double bed was very small, the room was small but not a problem.

A slight walk to some areas but not a problem for us. Staff seemed helpful and friendly. Although we did have a note pushed underneath the door very late one night asking us to go to the reception.

I stayed at the hotel and booked an upfraded star room, as my friends had booked for me and was concerned about the hotel. I ahd a right to be!! Hotel Facilities are very poor. No room service. Restaurant is only open for 'breakfast' and thats a poor continental only. Star room: powdered milk only. No bath towels, only hand sized towels. No hotel bar. No mini bar. Slow response. Only one person on duty in whole hotel in eve/nights. when they are not at reception at nights (ie trying to deal with this persons complaints - security is a concern) TV/Radio/email did not work. Got moved to another romm after first night. Guess what, the same - again they couldn't fix it when I called. Note rooms, I had a double, are very very small. If you'd like a bath-note shower only. To make star rooms seem larger, bathrooms have glass walls. I was alone, but if you are sharing with a friend you may find this 'unsuitable' as far as privacy goes. Now here is an unusual one: if you are a large/broad person you may have issues sitting on the toilet! Its snug between the shower and wall in the bathroom! The space is as wide as the toilet bowl. i'm 6'3'' and my shoulders wouldn't fit into the gap ! Its amsterdam, so.... But if you have problems with a hotel ajoining a gay adult cinema and/or men visiting the prostitutes along one other side of the hotel then perhaps not for you. My friends stayed in the standard rooms at the same time. The room they were allocated had a soiled carpet. Nice! Good room points- nice shower, but again no bath. We prepaid for the room and had a reciept that said 'All taxes and surcharges paid'. We checked the hotel bill the night before we left and the receptionist said we owed taxes. We pointed out the reciept and he accepted this. My friends checked out early and with the same receptionist, and there were no charges. When I checked out later, I was informed I owed taxes. I explained what had already been said and my friends had not paid. The manageress said that was a mistake and they should have been charged. I asked for a refund to an amount covering the inconveinence of upgraded facilities that did not work and for having to change rooms. She refused, and I felt was rude to me. She stormed into the back office and disappeared !

First the pros: you can walk there from the Central Station; it is very close to the Damrak (all the sightseeing tours leave from this street) and to the pedestrian streets; it is on a street packed with restaurants offering Chinese,English,Indian,Italian, Turkish and Argentinian food; the reception staff is excellent and go out of their way to help you; the rooms have all modern conveniences such as a safety box, a trouser press, a hairdryer, coffe-and-tea facilities; there are two elevators; breakfast is excellent and offers a wide range of food in a very attractively decorated room. Now for the cons: part of the building overlooks a side street which has a mini red-light district so that if you are on the lower floors you get a view of the open windows (now that I come to think of it, some might consider this a pro); some rooms are quite small; the reading light by the bed is insufficient for reading and in general the lighting in the room is poor, as well as the lighting in the sink area, where light is not adequate for shaving; there is an Internet point in the lobby, but you have to pay 6 Euro for one hour after which you are given a slip of paper with dozens of letters and numbers as username and password, but the second time I tried to access it I couldn't get in and I didn't get a refund, since I couldn't show that I had not used all of the alloted time.
