It didn't have a proper window for ventilation, just something that opened on to a small and airless shaft. The second room also had a smell, but less overpowering than the first. It, too, had no 'window', just a sliding pane that opened onto another shaft, this one without any daylight. The rooms are noisy because ill-fitting doors allow through any sound from the corridor (let alone the two nights I experienced of what appeared to be a screeching hen-party rushing up and down util the small hours). The rooms were clean, the bathroom large (but without hot water on the second morning). Based on reviewers' warnings, I did not try the breakfast (there are excellent places nearby, especially those close to the wonderful and unmissable) market. Despite other reviews claiming that the rooms are equipped with tea/coffee-making facilities, neither of my two rooms had these. The free WIFI works well in the rooms, but finding an electrical plug may require shifting the furniture around.

This establishment should not have any stars at all or only for the location at La Rambla. When I arrived I was surprised to learn that I had to pay the whole stay in advance and that they would not need any credit card, as the hotel did not allow the charging of food or beverages to the room. Everything had to be paid up front. There was no luggage service either, which was difficult for me, as I arrived a little under the weather and had problems getting my heavy bags through the maze of corridors on the 9th floor. The view from the terrace of my room was and surely is still amazing and made me forget the arrival surprises. This is, however, only a benefit if you are staying in of 2 rooms on the 9th floor, possibly also on the 8th. The room itself was reasonably clean and comfortable. Later, I met with some colleagues, who had fortunately checked into far better hotels, on my terrace, overlooking the skyline of Barcelona. We had a couple of drinks, all of which we had to get ourselves, as the hotel does not offer any room service. Btw: The remains of this get-together were left on the terrace until my departure 3 days later. This, however, was in line with the general cleaning policy of the hotel. They only changed towels (pretty old ones, I should add...) and made the bed, no further clean-up was done (I intentionally left some garbage at the end of the bath tub...it was never removed). The breakfast buffet reminded me of a students hostal, very few selections, and again no service is offered, you even have to get your own forks and knives. Of course, there was no late check-out available on the day of my departure, although I even offered to pay for a day room...the only solution offered was a luggage storage room at the 1st floor. Again, no help was offered by anyone. They just give you the key and tell you where it is, no receipt or other document is issued. This only key is apparently given to anyone, who asks for it, because, when I returned to the hotel some 6 hours later, a different receptionist just handed me the key without even inquiring for a passport or any other document. Fortunately noting was missing. The overall experience was definitely the worst I had in years. The same week, I had stayed a couple of nights in a small hotel in Germany, at half the price of the Ramblas Hotel, where they bent over backwards to please their guests, including eggs made to order and smoked salmon at breakfast.

We were pleasantly surprised with the rooms - we were on the eighth floor, 4 of the rooms were at the front of the hotel and 1 at the back. At the front we had lovely balconies with a small table and chairs that overlooked the Ramblas and we had a fabulous view across the rooftops of the city. The room at the back of the hotel had a huge balcony that had the sun on it for most of the day, and although the view wasnt quite as pretty as the front rooms (you were facing the back of some apartments that looked quite scruffy) there was still an incredible view across the city and a good view of the back of Gaudi's Geull palace. The rooms themselves were clean and comfortable; there was a small fridge in each room (no charge to use this) a safety deposit box (there was a charge for this), and the bathrooms were supplied with the usual complimentary soap, toothbrush, sewing kit etc. Towels were changed each day. Breakfast was quite basic but adequate. We found that the staff were very friendly and helpful with our enquiries.

When out in the city, especially in the tube stations, just beware of pickpockets. Myself and a fellow traveler both had items stolen from our bags.

The location of the Hotel Ramblas is very good and the service at the reception was also good. But the service at breakfast and the breakfast itself really weren't. Even when we didn't finish our meal and there were still other tables to clean, the personnel was standing next to our table (so we would hurry up and they could go on with cleaning). When I asked for a glass, they just pointed there finger towards the cups. So I had to take a cup (not that big of a deal but why not even give an explanation or excuse yourself that there aren't any glasses). Also the breakfast is untill 10.30 but when e.g. the eggs were out at 10.00 they wouldn't give extra eggs because it's near closing time. And the quality of the food is also not good. I first tried eggs and bacon (which I normally love), next day just bacon (and an apple afterwards, which I found out was old while eating) and the last day I just took cereals and yoghurt (cereals were old). I really didn't like the breakfast so I ended up having breakfast somewhere else every day. The room was nice and comfortable and we had a little terras, but the bathtub was very small and the toilet was annoyingly close to the washing table. The cleaning service at the other hand was very good! I went with my bf so I found it very strange to get a room with two seperate beds but we pushed them next to eachother and so that problem was solved. The cleaning lady just let them as we had pushed them and she was also very friendly! Always a nice 'hola' and she did her job very good :) I don't use the bar in an hotelroom, but our bar was empty. What if we would have liked to use the bar? Strange. Also the TV didn't work well. And the second day I had to buy earplugs because of the noise in the hotel.

Well as i only went to barcelona for a night, i didnt want anything too expensive So i booked this hotel. fairly basic nothing to shout about, small room, over looking Las Ramblas, big windows that open all the way, which is a bonus to lean out looking over Las Rambla. with the window shut you couldnt hear the noise outside. good view from my room (607) awful bed. no english channels on television ( no news) no tea/coffee making facilites. awful bedroom furniture. bathroom not bad, good shower, very clean and small toiletries. but there is a toothbrush/paste, shaving kit, gel douche. and an awful smelling hand soap. Breakfast not bad, but cold, cold bacon, cold chorizo sausages, cold scrambled eggs oh and not forgetting the cold beans. gave up on trying to make toast far too slow even for spanish standards. lots of pastries to spoil your figure. tea/coffee machine, not bad drinks. YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THESAFE IN THE ROOM, WHICH I ALWAYS HATE. THEY SHOULD ALWAYS BE FREE. there is a small bar but didnt use it, although the lady serving was very polite to everyone. check-in was good, very smartly dressed gentleman, room wasnt ready but offered to keep my luggage safe on 1st floor til room was done. if your there for a stopover, then that is the only reason i would recommend this hotel for.

The location is excellent, right in the centre, close to the Barri Gothic area and had easy access to the tourist bus. We took the airport bus to Plaza Catalunya for 4.05 euros and walked 10-15 minutes to the hotel. We had a large bright twin room with a window overlooking the Ramblas on the 6th floor.(Room 606) Obviously being on the centre of the Ramblas street there will be some noise but I did manage to sleep well every night. Other reviewers mentioned about pickpockets and petty crime in the area. We did not notice any incidents but one of the restaurants did mention to us about being careful about my rucksack and not leaving it hanging on my chair. There is a safe in the room which costs 2.50 euros a night so it is advisable to take out only the money you feel you will need and leave as much money, important documents, passports etc behind. The reception staff were very helpful and we had a late return flight and were able to leave our luggage in their luggage room when we checked out. Breakfast was plentiful and varied from cereal to cooked breakfast to cold meats and cake. There was plenty of everything and nothing appeared to run out. I can recommend the Barcelona tourist bus for 1 or 2 days at 21/26 euros for giving you an overall view of the city. Highlights were the Guell Park, Sagrada Familia ( we didn't actually go inside due to the large queues) and the Casa Milia( La Pedrera), all examples of Gaudi's work. There are lots of art musuems to go and visit but we did not have time to do everything. In the evening we ate in \"Les Quinze nits\" restaurant which is in the square across from the hotel. It is recommended in lots of the guide books for cheap good food in elegant surroundings. The food is indeed good and there are queues in the square when the restaurant opens in the evening at 8pm. My only criticisms of the hotel were that in the morning when the taps were turned on in the bathroom there were some bad smells. This was also noticeable outside when walking around Barcelona that the sewage system smelt. My other criticism was that the hotel did not provide a booklet about the hotel to give you more information.

It's certainly not the noisiest place I've stayed but I would recommend taking earplugs just in case if you happen to be a light sleeper.
