{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Exceptional Service, everything we could want After we experienced a night of hell in the David Inn, which was more like a scene our of Hostel than an 'Inn', we checked into Hotel Deco where we were greeted by the kindest and most accommodating old man who showed us to our ample room, with a new and clean bathroom. (He even helped me drag my luggage up the stairs which was the only place that thought to help so much) It felt like the Ritz compared to our previous stay. The location was great, right in the middle of the shops, near the train station and just a walk away from some bars. Service was exceptional and was great value for money. It wasnt the most extravagant hotel we stayed at but it was everything we could want for our stay in Florence. Great city and we wanted to stay longerthan our 3 days.", "Date": "Jan 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR522543183", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MforMelbourne"}, {"Content": "Nice people, torturous beds First the good: the staff was very friendly and patient with our lack of Italian (though we tried our best!). Our room was pretty quiet and didn't smell bad. The location is very nice -- right by the train station. Newly remodeled bathroom was updated, but something sticky was on the floor by the sink. The bad: The beds we joked must have been bought at the nearby museum of torture giftshop. It was as if they only used the box springs and put the matresses in another room. The springs poked into your body. We ended up putting the extra blankets under our sheets to shield us. The smoke detector had a blinking strobe light that forced us to find something -- anything to shield our eyes at night. The ceiling leaked mysterious fluid at one point. And, get this -- in ITALY -- the coffee was really bad. We tried not to think about how bad the exchange rate was -- we were paying as much as you would for an extremely nice room in most major american cities for a place that I might have been ok with tolerating when I was in college or something, but it was depressing to be there as an adult.", "Date": "Aug 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR904515770", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jamie_sommers"}, {"Content": "For Good Sports.

Me and my sister were there in last march for 3 days. We were a bit afraid because it was a 2 stars rated hotel and we have never been in a such low rated place, but it was the only one with vacancy room in that date and with such a short notice (we booked one day before going). We paid \u9227?5 per night with breakfast, which wasn\u9225\u6a9b bad because sleeping in Florence can be very expensive. The room is big and very nice. The bathroom was big enough and the Air-conditioned was working efficiently. We didn\u9225\u6a9b have any problems with hot water or heating, was simply perfect. It was a bit cold outside, but in our room the temperature was always something about 23 C, even when we arrived the staff had turned it on for providing that we were comfortable all the stay. The breakfast was very complete and the croissants were wonderful. The staff was very helpful and nice. The only think witch can be taken as negative point is the elevator, because only start in the first floor, and the reception is in the second one. But the staff is always trying to help to carry the bags (and ours weren\u9225\u6a9b light and short!!!). Is very close to the station of Santa Maria Novella (don\u9225\u6a9b bored to take a taxi, because is really close), in a street with lots of people and very close to the Duomo. Is a little door to a \u9225\u6e02ig\u9225?hotel. When we return to Florence we won\u9225\u6a9b look for other hotel, with more stars because we think Deco just perfect. You can go there from anywhere in Florence just walking. Florence is a city that we will never forget. Is fantastic!", "Date": "Jun 9, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR778678880", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "chbma"}, {"Content": "Hotel Deco - Convenient Location and Comfortable Stay Stayed 4 nights at Hotel Deco during our Italian holiday in July 2004. Very conveniently located in between the train station and the Duomo. The common areas in the hotel looked old and cramp, but we were given a rather big room (by European standards) equipped with a spacious bath room. The carpet in the room looked awful and in dire need of a good cleaning. Luckily we brought our own disposable bedroom slippers. The staff is friendly and helpful though one of them is perpetually on the phone making private calls. But on balance, a decent stay given the price we paid and since we do not have high expectations of European hotels.", "Date": "Nov 5, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR759691838", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Geneva_Diplomat"}, {"Content": "Posizione centrale ottima ma...   showReview(22769856, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR964469987", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "tr\u732bs moyen   showReview(16648417, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR343628077", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bernefertiti"}, {"Content": "L'Hotel Dec\u8c8c \u732b confortevole, la...   showReview(16732054, 'full');", "Date": "May 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR979737200", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "3 couples \u8305merveill\u8305s par...   showReview(11408781, 'full');", "Date": "May 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR607571001", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d229040-r12451051-Deco_Hotel-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "229040", "Price": "$165"}}
