No loss to me. It worked as a fridge, and as such we could fill it with our own cheaply bought soda, fruit and water. I thought the room was fantastic because of the balcony.

It is only one canal down from Dam square and comfortable walking distance from all the main sights of the city. The staff are very friendly and helpful and greeted us cordially when we arrived. The receptionist told us that she had a lovely room for us at the front of the hotel, looking out onto the street. However, she added that the bed was two pushed together rather than the double we had requested. Now the problem with this is that we have found that someone always ends up sleeping on the crack!!! So we asked if she could find us a double. She very obligingly arranged this. The room we got was now on the 7th floor (fast lifts, so fine there) and it looked out onto the back of the hotel. The room was small but perfectly adequate for a weekend break. It also had a small balcony which would have been lovely on a summer day, but rather redundant in February. This balcony could have done with a hosing down as it was a bit mossy from winter, but again probably something for the summer season. The fact that the room was at the rear was actually a good thing as the tram runs directly out-side the front door, so sleep was better at the back. We didn't take breakfast as we considered it somewhat expensive at 15 euro per person, particularly as my husband, who is a coeliac has to bring his own cereals and breads anyway. We found a lovely little cafe nearby which provided what we needed. At check out the desk staff were happy to do airline check in and print off boarding passes.

We both love Amsterdam, and this hotel is brilliantly located. It is a kilometer from Central Station, the trams stop 100 mts either side of the entrance, the Flower Market is literally around the corner, the Red Light district a short stroll through excellent restuarant and bar areas, and Dam Square is a half kilometer back towards Central Station. The hotel is on the route for tram numbers 4-16-24 and 25 - buy an unlimited travel ticket from Tourist Information (GVB ) situated opposite Central Station (mind the ongoing Metro works). These tickets are available elsewhere, but this office can provide you with all the information you need for your stay - these lines also take you to the Museums, the Markets, Anne Frank House, and the Westerkirk. Vitually all other trams can be caught in and around Dam Square. The Hotel itself is four-star. However, apart from the Bed and the Bathroom, we rarely make use of the facilities, as we always stay on a room only basis. The hotel has an excellent coffee shop, and late check-out can be arranged where possible. Amentities within easy walking distance are excellent restaurants (hence room only basis for us - Breakfast at the Nieuwe Kerk (New Church) in Dam Square is brilliant); the central canals. and major shopping areas. We went here as a couple, but it would be equally good for friends, familiy and solo. It is frequented by business people, but the business facilities are not brilliant e.g. the internet is a bit of a nightmare. However, we go to shut ourselves off from the rest of the world and enjoy the brilliant amenities that Amsterdam has to offer, whether it be sitting with coffee in a square or a bottle of wine by a canal and watching the world go by; checking out bustling markets, and quiet museums; eating in fine restaurants or simply window shopping.

It seems that being a regular customer counts for nothing. They swipe your card but I don't know why as the mini bar is empty. Internet is free in the oh but charged at a hefty rate in the rooms. Get your act together. If you're a business hotel charging premium corporate rates then Internet should be free. It'es a deal breaker when I book a hotel myself. I will try and advise my client to book a different hotel but it's difficult. I suppose I'll just have to go on complaining about rooms in order to get a decent one, praying that they haven't lost my reservation in the first place, and hoping against hope that being a regularly visitor starts to count for something.

Amsterdam is obviously a very expensive city and you don't get much for your money accommodation-wise.... I always spend ages reviewing hotels/ apartments; the key thing for me is to ensure the best value for money. I had worked out from the description that it was either going to be the NH Carlton or the Caransa, and was pleased it turned out to be the Carlton as the reviews of the two hotels seemed to show the Carlton as the quieter of the two. We were greeted by a very friendly receptionist who checked us in quickly and luckily, just before a huge group arrived for check-in. The lobby is as expected, quite grand in an old-skool hotel sort of way, big chandelier etc...... we went to our room to find that, for the first time ever, we had been upgraded and were in a \"suite\" which had a separate kitchenette area, walk-in cupboard with electronic safe, and usual bathroom with complimentary shampoo etc - the shower is great and thanfully, the shower curtain wasn't overly-affectionate (I hate them! Cringe!). The beds were very comfortable (although as usual in Europe, two singles pushed together), the pillows however were the weirdest I've ever experienced - they were a bit like sleeping on an airbag as they didn't seem to flatten when you put your head on them!! We discovered on leaving that apparently the hotel have four types of pillows to choose from - shame we didn't notice this before as it would have made our respective sleeps that much more comfortable. This hotel is all about the location - you really are as central as you could ever hope to be, right next to the Flower Market. 15 minutes walk to Central Station, 5 minutes to the canals, 5 minutes to Rembrandplein and 15 minutes to Leidseplein/Museums. Plenty of trams as well although we didn't use them once this time round. Unfortunately, being so central has it's disadvantages in that we were disturbed throughout the night with revellers on their way out of town, groups coming back to the hotel, people leaving the cinema across the road, rubbish/delivery trucks in the morning etc etc. In terms of other costs, we were offered breakfast at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15 per person which is frankly extortionate - there are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby where you can get pancakes or english breakfasts with coffee for under \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9 per person. Similarly, wi-fi is available in the lobby of the hotel at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9 per day. You also do need to pay the city tax on departure, which was circa \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 for the three nights There is a big bowl of sweets in reception which are free though! All in all, I would say that this hotel is all about location but you've got to weigh up what that means for you. The hotel is definitely in need of updating, the carpets and curtains look dated and there's that lingering old hotel smell..... so I wouldn't say it's a 4* by today's standards. I feel we got good value for money having received the upgrade, however I'm afraid I don't think I would return as I would probably go for somewhere a bit quieter next time, or pay slightly more to stay somwhere a bit more current.

There is an additional tax to pay when leaving the hotel which I think was 5 Euros a night although I cant remember and it was only a few days ago, I didnt take much notice so it wasnt a great deal anyway. The hotel does have a bar but didnt use that either, all in all its worth going to if you want to wander around the city and the staff at reception were very helpful and polite.", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel - but watch out for the extras!\u201d", "Author": "sidenhill", "ReviewID": "UR103204056", "Content": "I stayed at the hotel from a training course, fortunately I found out before hand that breakfast would cost me E20 so I opted not to have the breakfast.

The bathroom was spacious and towels cleaned whenever you needed them, great shower although we didnt have hot water at one point later on at night on one occassion.

After weeks of exhaustive research I chose the NH Carlton. It would be easy to say that from the moment I arrived I knew I had chosen correctly but that's actually not true. Their reservations staff was so polite, responsive and accommodating by email I knew I had chosen correctly even before I stepped off the plane. First the location. Doesn't get better. You are in the center of everything. Equal walking distance to pretty much every part of town. RIght next to a tram stop which is key especially when it's cold. The front desk was friendly, fast and helpful. Did I have to wait a few minutes? Sure. Someone walked in right ahead of me to check in and another guest was being helped by the cute Dutch girl behind the counter. It drives me crazy when I read these reviews and bratty guests -- usually US -- act like the world is going to end if they have to wait five minutes to have their diaper changed. The lobby was well appointed, sparkling and inviting. No attitude here. When I was given my key I knew I was in for a treat. I had asked the hotel that if an upgrade wasn't possible could they maybe give me a high floor with a view. I am a photographer https://picasaweb.google.com/zensled/NeuronsOnSiesta# and always enjoy getting some perspective on things. Well I was heading for the 6th floor which is a rare thing in this wonderfully old and intimate city! The elevators were numerous, fast and spacious. Also rare. The hallways are typical for a Dutch hotel when on a budget. Nothing fancy for sure, but clean. I have stayed in 4 other hotels in Amsterdam and can tell you that unless you want to spend $400 US per night, you should let go of the expectation that everything will be opulent, spotless and gilded. You might like to pretend it's 1650 but it ain't so get over yourself. When I opened the door to my room I literally dropped my bag. To say they had given me an \"upgrade\" is an understatement. My home for the next week would be a two room suite on the corner of the building with a pristine view of the city. As I walked into the space I was pretty sure that my plane had crashed and this was my heaven. The bed was great. The sheets and pillows couldn't have been better. Mini bar and safe. Plenty of closet space. The room was warm when I wanted it to be and cool when I needed it to be. And yes, I could open the windows which is not always an easy thing to find in an older city. Even though I was facing a busy street the windows kept out almost all of the noise. Not all? No, but this is a bustling city. If you want pristine silence go to the mountains. The bathroom was beautiful and clean. Marble. Good water pressure. An actual shower head. A toilet that was dependable. If you have travelled much you know that these simple things can never be taken for granted. Was the TV a flat screen? Was there free internet in the room? No, I'm on vacation, I don't need to be sitting in my room channel surfing and checking emails. There is free internet in the lobby and if you must get a longer fix you can go across the street to McDonald's where it is free. Once again I must rant. Who are these travelers who give hotels bad reviews for such ridiculous things. The comforts of home are good service, a bed and shower. Not technology. Get over yourselves. If I needed to know something I asked the staff downstairs who always had the answers. If I needed entertainment I left the friggin hotel! For the next week, the Carlton never missed a beat. Housekeeping paid attention to details and was incredibly fast to respond on the days when I slept late and only gave them a small window to do their thing. There was always a mint waiting on my pillow when I'd return. I never ate in the restaurant but it always had lots of people and looked quite nice. I know I got lucky. I arrived mid-week in January and hit the jackpot with the room I was given. I can't count on that happening (nor should you) when I return to the Carlton. But return, I definitely will.

The people are so friendly, and go out of their way to help you. They speak almost perfect English, and any time we asked for directions, they were given with a smile. From asking at the station which platform to Central Station, to the Tourist Office outside the station asking which Tram to take to the hotel, the service was brilliant. We were given a tourist map and the hotel was circled. Even I couldn't go wrong. Check in was simple, and directions to the room and where breakfast was held was made very clear. We went to our room and this was the only disappointing thing of our stay. The room was too small. This may be a ploy to get you to upgrade but the bed was too big for the room. However, we may have been spoiled by previous hotel stays. You can upgrade for 25 euros per night if you wish to a superior room but to be honest, to me a room is a room. But a bit disappointing. No complaints about the housekeeping, and got an extra pillow when I asked for it. The cleaner, Izabella,was very friendly and always had a great smile. The sweet on the pillow every day was a nice gesture. Breakfast was very good. A nice touch was when we went down for the first time, one of the staff there took you across to the buffet area and pointed out where everything was. You didn't stand there like a lemon wondering where everything is. The location of this hotel is superb. 15 minutes walk from the top end of town, and 10 to 15 minutes walk to the lower end where the museum area and the Vondel Park is. There is not too much traffic going past the hotel and what there is was not too noticeable. It was close to plenty of restaurants and bars, and the area has a nice atmosphere about it. Whilst in Amsterdam we did not have a bad meal. The first night we went around the corner to Saturninos, Reguliersdwarsstraat 5. A small Italian restaurant, with great atmosphere, and a cosy, informal manner. Beautiful soft slices of veal for me, an excellent plate of chicken for my wife with a lovely sauce on top. Superb food. Need I say any more. Go there. The second night we went Dutch. We went to a place called Het Karbeel, Warmoesstraat 16, in the centre of town. A popular meal was Fondu which a number of tables were having.However, I had steak and was able to cut it with a butter knife, it was so tender and moist. Again no complaints. The last night we went to a thai restaurant down near Leideslein square. It was only okay, but that was compared to what had gone before. One other place deserves a mention. We had lunch at Cafe Mankind, Wetteringstraat 60, a small bar near the Rijksmuseum and antiques area, overlooking a small canal. They serve the best pea soup in Amsterdam, and the Club sandwich was superb. It was so good we went out of our way to go back there for lunch the next day. Well done Frank, the owner,for a superb place. It has AMBIENCE. All in all, a great break, and batteries recharged for the coming months.

The breakfast seemed quite expensive (20 Euro each) but there are supermarkets nearby so we picked up some things ourselves and kept them in the minibar fridge. Failing that, there are cafes close by as well alongside the flower market.

One \"nit\" to mention: the initial room they gave us had a small queen bed (felt like what we call in the US a \"full bed\"); unfortunately, my wife was sick and she didn't want to give me what she had. We asked for a room with two beds, or a larger bed. Initially the person at the front desk was not able to help us. After talking to her manager, the manager was able to give us a room with two beds but it took a few minutes to go back-and-forth with her. It would have been nice if this was a little easier, but she was cool and overall it was not a big deal. In short, the staff turned what could have been a bad situation into a good one.

When we arrived we were surprised at how big the hotel seemed. Including a restaurant at ground level, it spreads across (and even over!) the local streets. Not so pretty from the outside, inside it is relatively modern and definitely clean. Check-in was friendly and hassle-free, our room was on the 4th floor, directly overlooking the street outside. The rooms were double-glazed so if the windows were closed traffic noise wasn't a problem. Refreshingly, the windows opened all the way so if you did want to sit on the window-sill and people watch, it is possible - there always seemed to be something going on outside in the mornings! Decor-wise, some of the corridors and communal areas looked a little tired, as did the rooms. It wasn't out-dated, but definitely not cutting edge either. But the room was clean and perfectly useable, having most of the facilities you would expect from a hotel of this class - toiletries, tea & coffee, full TV system, etc. One slight niggle was a request to come and reset the safe (which someone had kindly locked with their credit card and then checked out!) after which the handyman turned his attention to our air-conditioning which he said was too noisy. He then promptly disconnected it, and never returned to fix it, despite us reminding reception about it for the next two days. In the end it was never fixed. Not a major problem, but had it been slightly warmer this would have been very annoying! A quick complaint via email after we returned home earned us a voucher for our next stay, so I suppose they did try to redeem themselves... Our stay did not include breakfast, and we didn't make use of any of the hotel facilities so I can't comment on their quality. The location of this hotel is faultless, you are right in the heart of the city, and easy walking distance to all the major sites. We even walked from the train station to the hotel on our arrival, with no need for a Taxi, which was a pleasant change! The area is safe and busy even at night, although as always it's wise to exercise some common sense after dark and don't flash valuables - but what city don't you need to do that in these days! If I return to Amsterdam I would try and stay here again, purely because of the price and location. The air-conditioning issue aside I was very pleased with the service.

There were a bunch of small bars and so it could be noisy at night. The trash pick up in the morning was the worst though. The simple solution was to close the window.

Be aware that you will need 50 euros upfront to pay for the mini bar, but if you use nothing you get this back, one tip, i checked the mini bar out and it was about 50% full, i took a picture of this and took it to reception and asked if this is how it was supposed to be, they said no, babette showed her colleague who assured me the house keeping would fill it up the next day, she made 2 calls but the next day house keeping did not fill it up, luckily i had babette when i checked out, so she knew the situation with the mini bar so i got my money back easily. The hotel is walking distance to everything, the albert cyup market is a leaisurely 20 min walk its a straight road, again follow the tram lines if you are unsure, there is a supermarket, at the side of the heiniken attraction, where you can pick up most things, it is a 20 min walk back up to cantral station and about 10 mins to the red light district, you are opposite the mcdonalds and noodle place, burger king is on the same road as the side entrance to mc d's and so is subway, rembrandt square is lively and a good place to head, Internet usage, i didnt pay for this, you can get 15 minbs free at reception and if you have a device laptop phone etc, you can get a code from reception to use the internet wireless, which was handy on the last day. Also my flight was not until 7pm, the hotel have a locked room where guests can leave their bags, until they are ready to leave, they give you a ticket and reception hold the key.

When checking in we were given the option of a double bed in a non smoking room or 2 twins pushed together (fairly common im told) in a smoking room. We went for the proper double and were pleased to find out our room was ready despite arriving early. Unfortunately when we got to our room, we found that we had actually been allocated the twin bed option with 2 single duvets. Our second encounter with the same lady occured when trying to book a canal cruise for the evening. We had booked another excursion with a gentleman the day before, however, when trying to book a cruise for our last evening the receptionist told us it would be easier to book ourselves. After telling her we were heading in the opposite direction for the day, she told us we would be able to book one if we just headed to central station that evening... needless to say we were told that we should have booked and never got to do a canal trip. Having said that, the other staff were brilliant... friendly and one gentleman on reception went out of his way to find a local fondu restaurant after the one we had planned on visiting had shut down. The room room was small, basic and a little tired, but clean and perfectly adequate for the time we spent there. We had no real view as our room faced the back of the hotel but we spent very little time there so it wasnt a problem. The bathroom was again small but everthing we needed (basic toiletries were also supplied, but nothing fancy). I found a hair in the bath on the first day, but apart from that it seemed to be fairly clean. Breakfast was included, and each morning there was a good selection of breads, pastries, cereal, fruits and a small cooked breakfast selection. Although we ate breakfast there every morning, there is a huge selection of cafes serving breakfast, brunch and snacks just a short distance from the hotel. The location is fantastic! I didnt realise quite how small Amsterdam was, but everything is within 15- 20 minutes walking distance from the hotel. Central Station, Anne Franks House, the Van Gough Museum and the Heineken experience are all close by... and although we never needed to use them, the trams are frequent and apparently pass all the major attractions. All in all i wouldnt say this hotel is up to 4*standard. After being an air hostess and being lucky enough to have stayed in 4* hotels all over the word , i say it was more a 3*... however, if you can grab a bargain with this hotel and your not planning on spending much time there, then its a great place to base yourself while you explore Amsterdam!", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "J8J812", "Title": "\u201cWORST FRONT DESK STAFF EVER!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "J8J812", "ReviewID": "UR54095490", "Content": "I have never seen such unfriendly, clueless, rude, and unpleasant reception staff in a hotel like at the NH Carlton.

The reception went well and they had the room ready for me when I arrived at 10:30am. I've been to Europe many times and this is always welcome after a long red eye flight. I asked for a room with a view and they gave me a \"quiet view\" facing Reguliersdwarsstraat (street on the back side of the hotel). When we got up to the room, we found it small but sufficient. Two twin beds pushed together, a decent sized bathroom, mini bar fridge, coffee making facilities, nice black-out drapes and one extra pillow....I've stayed in worse. There was, unfortunately, no safe in the room. If you need a safe, you have to get one down in the lobby (it's free) and an attendant has to let you in the safe vault room, so plan ahead if you need to use the safe. The room window opens, which is nice since the room can get stuffy, especially after showering. The window is also fairly soundproof but since Reguliersdwarsstraat has a few clubs that go until the wee hours of the morning, expect to occasionally hear noise. One downside, I always buy a phone card to make calls back to the States while away. I was told by reception that using a phone card with the hotel phone is free. However, when I checked out, reception told me that I had to pay 1.50 euros everytime I got an outside line from my room. I made quite a few calls which resulted in a shocking bill. A couple checking out before me was also surprised when they had to pay a phone bill as well. Be warned! I have no other problem with the Nh Carlton other than the phone issue. In fact, I would rate this hotel a little higher if this didn't happen. They should tell everyone upfront, especially when asked about the phone like I had done! Other than this, the staff was friendly, the housekeeping service was very good and the location of the hotel is great. Here's a few tips: The Thai restaurant on Reguliersdwarsstraat, Phuket, is very good and reasonably priced. Also, if you walk down Reguliersdwarsstraat, on the back side of the hotel, you will reach Koningsplein where you'll find an Albert Heijn supermarket. Among most things that you would want, it sells pretty cheap sandwiches and beer. Also, if you go to Amsterdam in the summer, try Zandfoort beach, west of Haarlem.

As a consequence my reservation doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always end up in the NH system *sigh*.

The room itself is quite large for Amsterdam standards with a separate walk in closet located in the back of the room. The bathroom again was quite spacious and fitted with a bidet and jet bubble bath, which I have yet to find at the other NH hotels in the city. Another feature not found in the NH Doelen, NH Caransa or NH Schiller is the movie on demand options on the TV. Ok most travelers will probably be out on the town rather than in their room watching TV, but thought it was worth a mention for the business travelers and families with kids.

The bathroom was small by modern standards and the shower curtain too short which soaked the floor after two showers. We were informed that housekeeping was off duty after 17hrs so the floor would remain like that till the next morning. Fresh towels were provided however. The complimentary toileteries, though seeming modern with their vivid colours, stank. The bed was uncomfortable which rendered the modern 'lifestyle' approach of a pillow menu totally futile and incongruous. The room was realy cold at night. There is no roomservice after 22h.

We thought this would be a convenient and cost effective way to get us to the airport for our return home. Boy was I wrong, we arranged at reception to be picked up at 11am, but by 11.45am there was still no sign of the bus. The porters on duty were extremely apologetic and were concerned for us. They did admit that we were not the first people to be let down by this service. We were panicing at this stage, fearful that we would miss our flight. One of the porters hailed us a taxi on the street and we made a mad dash to the airport and made it on time.

As for the amenities: the room wasn't large by US standards, but it was comfortable, had a high tech clean bathroom, had a large bay window that opened entirely so you could people watch on the streets below or have a good North Sea breeze coming in (we slept with it open). It had a cool large triangular mirror in the room.

I then found out that the breakfast I had to fight to get was complete rubbish - cheap, long-life orange juice, and a rather sparse, unappetising buffet. Then, I wondered what the cheap breakfast at the cafe must be like, and felt glad that I had paid more, because anything worse than that would be inedible.

When she returned and put a beer can into the minibar, I told her that we had not taken anything from the minibar, but she said \"I only check and replace missing items\". She then walked out of the room again, this time she left the outer door to the minibar wide open. She expects guests to close minibar doors after her! Then, to avoid a false charge at chekout, I went to Reception and told them that I had not taken anything from the minibar, and to make sure that I was not charged at checkout. They said they would deal with it. At checkout, guess what? Yes, on the bill was the minibar item. So, my discussion the previous day with Reception had been a complete waste of my time. Luckily, at checkout, the minibar charge was removed, but I didn't want to leave the problem until then, because then there would be greater suspicion that I was not telling the truth. The hotel and corridors are dark, ugly and dated, but inside our room was surprisingly better. To conclude, our stay was marred by the completely dreadful customer service. Staff appear not to have received any training in customer service. There appears to be no understanding by staff as to what makes a stay enjoyable and what makes it annoying. We found that being turned away from the breakfast room and having to produce our proof of eligibility is unforgivable.

DO NOT take a taxi from the airport unless you don't mind paying through the nose. Taxi fare from the airport is 40 EUROS. Avoid taxis at all costs in Amsterdam.. The metres run like a cheetah!! Initial fare is 5 euros and it just skyrockets from there in the blink of an eye! I couldn't believe it. Become familiar with the streetcar system in the city.. it is very easy to follow and wonderfully convenient. The streetcar is your friend!! Instead of taking taxi from airport, I recommend the following to reach the Jolly Carlton Hotel: 1. Take train from the airport to \"CENTRAL STATION\" 2. Buy a \"StripKaart\" (I think that's what it's called) or pay cash fare of about 1.60 Euros and take the Tram # 4 or #9. 3. Ask to be dropped off near the FLOWER MARKET. Hotel is about a 2 minute walk from here. Anyway, on to the hotel ... Location is amazing. You can walk to virtually every major tourist spot within 10-15 mins. Staff is friendly and the hotel is clean and well decorated. There is a nice bar on the ground floor which overlooks the street - very nice place to relax and have a beer while people watching. The bartenders and staff at the bar were very friendly. although i did not eat there, the food that neigboring tables were being served looked quite delicious. Noise from the street is tolerable. We were on the 3rd floor on weekend nights and, with the windows shut we really had no trouble sleeping. Breakfast at the hotel was unreasonably expensive at 15 Euros. All I had was cereal and some juice. Perhaps I should have eaten more if I had known I was going to be charged that amount! Even still, 15 euros is excessive for breakfast, even by London England standards. A great place to eat is just on the way to Rembrandt square called Wok to Walk. very nice, cheap, and quick food if youre on the run and don;t want to spend too much money. Very nice smokeshop that was featured in the movie OCean's 11 is locted within a 5 minute walk: DAMPKRING. You can sit at the same table that Brad Pitt and Matt Damon sat on during filming! I don't smoke, but this place came very highly recommended (no pun intended) by a local friend of mine. Apparently the quality of product, atmosphere, and crowd are the best in the city.

I requested and received a nonsmoking room which was really nonsmoking--never quite guaranteed when you are in Europe. I should add that I only paid about $110 a night via hotels which was quite a bargain. The service was formal but adequate. Knowing Italian is a plus here because half the staff is from Italy, particularly those who work at the restaurant. That said, the reception desk people speak perfect English, and so does the hotel operator. Breakfast costs something like 12 Euros extra, but because I already knew this from the website, I never tried it. There are some wonderful pastry and coffee shops just down the street, like Kweekboom on Reguliersbreestraat, so you really have no reason to pay big bucks for a hotel breakfast unless you really wish to. There are two restaurants and a \"grand cafe\" on the premises. I tried the cheaper restaurant (not Caruso) and was decidedly underwhelmed by the service and the food. Between that and the fat surcharge you would have to pay for room service here (8 Euros above the price of the meal--which works out to $25 for pizza from room service), you're best off eating at any of the nice restaurants within a few steps. The location is pretty good, just steps from the 4 and 9 tram Muntplein stop, which is very useful. You do _not_ need to take a cab to get here until after 12:30 am when the trams stop. And even then, because the hotel is only two blocks from Dam Square, you probably won't be too far to begin with in this compact city. Everyone's reviews already forewarned me about the weirdness of the hot water service in the bath. Jolly even puts stickers in the shower to let people know that on occasion the water can get scalding hot. It happened to me once during a shower. Basically, be prepared to step away from the water and turn the temperature down when necessary. That said, the bathroom was clean and the water really was hot. And the towels were fresh and plentiful. And again, you're never guaranteed any of those things in Europe, even at some places that call themselves four star. Basically, this was a good, solid four star hotel. I would consider returning, but given the choice, I think I would try out Dikker & Thijs Fenice because it's cheaper, includes breakfast, and is right next to the 1/2/5 tram line stop, which gets you to more places you might be interested in. However, Amsterdam is so compact, you can basically stay almost anywhere in the city center and get wherever you want to go.

Plenty of tea and coffee, and a sweet with a message by our beds. The bathroom was lovely really big with 2 was basins, shower and a bath. Ther was a hairdryer, but this was in the bathroom so you had to stand I think they could put a stool in there, as usual with foreign hotels there was no plug by a mirror in the lounge so couldnt use own hairdryer, I gave up and stood.

Upon arrival, I was greeted professionaly by a seasoned receptionist who would normally attribute the lousiest room since the booking was done through an internet base hotel reservation which could obtain rates not even proposed by a travel agent, and my rate was very low (which is logical to me). They notice that I was walking with a crutch, they immediately upgrade my room to a supperior one which is located on the first floor. In front of the room, things started badly as the magnetic key didn't syncronise with the room lock, so it was back to the reception and a change of key card, this time accompanied by the porter, I was finnaly in the room. I was surprised. First becauce through getting cheap rate with a rack rate going over 300 and they really gave me a superior room which I went over carefully, from the bathrooms (a large one , the minibar , the coffee making facilities to the options for internet connection and found nothing wrong with the except maybe the soundproof windows which was difficult to shut, but well nevermind, I got a decent room for once and will certainly not complained about it. The bathrooms was even equiped with a shower stall with a seat for people who are not that strong with there legs. After a shower and a very comfortable sleep, it was panic in the morning as I forgot to bring my shaving kit, I call housekeeping who replied she will see what she could do and less that 5 minutes later, the doorbell rang and it was room service with box containing a shaving kit. Upon arriving at the reception for the checkout, the staff was polite and total checkout time including the fact that I booked throught the internet, but want to pay for the rooms upon checkout took less than 5 minutes while the staff asked if my stay at there hotel was alright and when i told them I would prefer to stay here than the Grand Krasnapolsky, it was all a proud smile. All in all this was the best hotel for me in Amsterdam in comparing with other top name hotels. On the positive side, the staff is very efficient and the rooms well equiped and well maintained except for the magnetic key lock and the soundproof window which didn't shut very well, I would personnaly stay here again for these reasons: I got a very good room for the price I paid, a friendly and efficient staff and situated 3 tramways stop or by walking the main shopping street Kalverstratt, the hotel is located at the end of this street.

The room was very pleasant and comfortable with a safe, minibar etc - only minor fault really was the double bed was 2 singles. The Hotel was clean, comfortable and the staff helpful. The location of the hotel - (one of the reasons I chose it) was fantastic - close to everything. We had a short break but everything was so easy to get to that we were able to fit in everything we wanted to do. Few things to do on your trip - Anne Frank House well worth a visit, go up the tower of the Westkerk to get a fabulous view of Amsterdam, of course a canal cruise, don't miss the Begijnhof a secret village in the middle of town hidden off the Spui. The Leidsplein area is a great way to spend the evening with so many choices of what and where to eat or to just watch the world go by or the street artists perform. Our few days were packed with great sights, wonderful food (try the Indonesian experience of rijsttafel a selection of dishes with rice) at the Kantijil & de Tijger on Spuistraat, pancakes at Pancake Corner and tea on the top floor of Metz & Co down the road from the Jolly where you can see the whole of the city. I could go on as there were so many good things to see and do. Book the Jolly and you won't be disappointed - but try and get a good deal. One thing to watch for - we booked the Airport Connexion bus to take us back to the airport for 11 euros each however it didn't turn up (booked for 1.45pm), we had to get a taxi at the last minute and pay taxi fare the one thing we tried to avoid. I felt the Hotel could have done something to address this as they knew we were waiting. We were lucky a taxi was pulled up outside so we jumped in.

One other drawback was that the cleaners started cleaning rooms quite early in the morning.

We would have preferred a hotel near the RAI but all of these were booked up, too expensive or had bad reviews on this site. Therefore we settled on the Jolly Carlton as it was just off Rembrantdplein and on the route of the number 4 tram, which goes directly to the RAI. The hotel is a few tram stops down from Central Station with the RAI Centre about 20 minutes further down the line. I booked one standard double room each for myself and my colleague on Expedia. I arrived on a Sunday and did not get an upgrade to a superior room whereas my colleague arrived on a Tuesday and, without prompting, did get an upgrade. We both checked out on Friday morning so perhaps his shorter stay meant he was more likely to get the lucky break. I cannot speak for my colleague's room but my standard double room (215) was suitable for its purposes. The size of the room was adequate for one person but it may feel a bit cramped for two. There was plenty of cupboard and hanging space, the desk was a good size and the separate table and chairs were most useful. The desk was too close to the bed for comfort and there was a general lack of power points but I got by by shuffling recharging devices. Free coffee/tea making facilities were included. The bed was very comfortable for a hotel bed and it had decent pillows. The window arrangement was slightly odd, semi-circular in shape with an assortment of drapes to pull across and no view to speak of. However there was no significant light spill or noise creep from the fairly busy main road outside and this was a big plus for me. In fact, I didn't realise I had the AC turned on for the first two days, which was helping to mask the outside noise. The bathroom was very clean and well stocked, with an excellent lighted shaving mirror. The shower, over a medium size bath, was very cramped; anyone over 6 foot would have to stand sideways to avoid bumping their shoulder into a protruding wooden cover along the length of the cieling above the bath, which was hiding a large pipe I presumed. The shower itself was slightly tricky to get the temperature right - and keep it there - but I've had much worse and the pressure was good. The mini-bar was reasonably stocked, with a small can of Heineken costing 5 euros. I used the laundry service at 10 euros for a pair of jeans and these were competently cleaned. The wireless internet did not work very well, maybe because the antenna on my room's device was broken. The 100Mb LAN connection from the same device did work well, even if it was more than 20 euros for one day's access (max 24 hours, to 14:00). The television worked properly with BBC World, Sky News and CNN for the English speaker and a better choice of German, Dutch, French and Italian channels for others. The description of the hotel on Expedia claimed that all rooms have a mini-safe. This is not the case! Also, there was nothing even vaguely suitable that I could find to securely attach a kensington lock to. Even though the staff at reception were more than happy to put my laptop in the back room when I wanted to leave it at the hotel, I would have preferred to secure it in my room. The hotel recpetion staff and porters were all very friendly and spoke excellent English (and Italian I think). I chose not to eat at the hotel since I did not have time for a full breakfast and most other meals were provided at the conference. The menu looked expensive but of a high standard. Overall, I would say this is a good three star hotel but not a four star hotel. If you are going as a couple, or are over 6 feet tall, I would strongly recommend getting one of the Superior rooms but for a single person or a small couple, the standard rooms are sufficient. I will give it 4/5 however if I had had to pay for the room myself, I would have given 3/5.", "Date": "July 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario Canada", "Title": "\u201cgreat experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3649963", "Content": "lots of bad reviews on the web, however we had a great time. rooms were fine and we stayed economy! not the best view but a good view with an interesting view of the city (by the way if you are in Amsterdam and you spend more than 8 hours in the hotel you should go home!).

Amsterdam is likely the best people watching city, with the Dutch some of the nicest and most friendly people we have met. I would go back in a heart beat. the tour books correctly state that while Amsterdam is a small city it is very compact and full of attractions. the Tulip market is at the door of the Jolly and is wonderful and not to be missed.

The beer is cold, the staff professional, and the Italian resturant (in the hotel) has some of the best service and food we have experienced (and owing to the calibre affordable). Kids listen to me with the cost of direct flights (inexpensvie) and the efficiency of the airport (the best I have seen and I have been in many), the Dutch hospitality (very friendly to Canadians) and very efficient transportation, go to Amsterdam and forget LA, Vancouver or Toronto!

The hotel was 4* but would probably rate it 3* in England but clean, comfortable and tidy with friendly staff. The city is very clean and pleasant to walk around. The transport system is the best trams, bikes and canal buses being very popular to travel on. We walked most places though but did by a canal bus ticket which was fairly expensive but worth it as we spent nearly a full day just going up and down the different canals as they offer a different perspective on the city and you can take it on at your own pace rather than getting caught up in the pace of other tourists. The city has become extremely commercialised. The squares are much like Spain, in respect of the bars, like Irish bars etc. Not at all like Paris where they have not embraced the tourist but expected the tourist to embrace their city, which I personally preferred. The Red Light District is not at all what you would expect. Unless you go down the smaller side streets then perhaps this is where it all happens but as I was with my partner we did not do this we just stuck to the main streets where tourists were walking even with younger children in some groups so that shows how tame it actually is for some. There is a lot of pick pocketing signs so be careful with your money. Even though we were not a victim of this crime I can imagine it is quite common as at the busy markets there are a lot of people just pushing past you. Money - The exchange rate is ok for the UK and exchanging your \u00c2\u00a3 to Euros in the UK is great too and free, but in Amsterdam the commission was around 8% which is 1% too much for me so we just drew money from the cash points I would suggest you do the same if your bank offers you this service for free like ours as it is rare for shops, bars etc to credit cards be it Visa or MasterCard etc, they like their cash only system it would seem.

At 4-star prices, I received 1-star service from a management staff I can only describe as cold, rude and uncarring of client requests/concerns. A miscommunication over the hotel's online booking system left me with a much larger bill than expected and when I made repeated requests (via e-mail after leaving Holland)for clarification, all of my requests went unanswered. Moreover, I paid for expensive breakfasts I didn't eat and wasn't aware I was being charged for (If you do stay here be very vigilant about your billing!!). When I inquired about getting a rebate for meals that I didn't eat, my inquiry went unanswered. Any other 4-star hotel I've stayed at would have at very least offered responses to my concerns. Even a simple \"sorry, sir, there's little we can do...\" would have sufficed. Amsterdam has numerous 3/4-star hotel choices that far surpass the Jolly in price and service, so I highly urge readers of this to look elsewhere for a room. And a suggestion to the hotel management: you and your staff are in dire need of public relations skills training. You have much to learn about the hotel business.

We were supposed to arrive on the Fri night, but due to Air Traffic probs, we were 3 hours late, arriving at the hotel at 12.30am. We had pre-booked 3 months ago and paid in full for 2 rooms, only to be told on our arrival that the rooms had been given to someone else.We were told this was tough luck & at no time was an apology given.We were put in a taxi to another hotel at the other end of town, which the taxi driver could not find (you would think the Jolly would have given him directions) & finally got to our rooms at 3.00am.The next day, we commenced our siteseeing feeling extremely tired. Upon our return to the alternative hotel for lunch, we were locked out of our rooms and told this was because the Jolly hotel had only paid for one night & had just called to ask that we be sent back to the Jolly Hotel. We then had to pack again, and suffer another taxi ride across Amsterdam, effectively losing most of the afternoon. On arrival at the Jolly, we were given a room upgrade, which was fine, but did not make up for the fact we had lost at least half a day of a one and a half day trip (result of not getting up early because of late check-in & being sent back to Jolly). The excuse used by the hotel was they had problems with their system. This is hard to believe as surely a hotel should only accept payment/ money for the number of rooms in their hotel and no more? We were travelling with my mum & her sister, who were both on their first trip abroad at the age of 70 - I fear that as a result of the problems, this will have been their first and last trip. Added to the above probs, the bar staff were rude and arrogant and the service poor. I put our drinks on the room tab and when I had to sign for it, I could not understand what to write and where as it was all in Dutch. The bar man proceeded to ridicule me in front of other customers. He could obviously speak good English, so all he need to say was 'please print you name here'.

Location is excellent, literally 10 minutes to everything. Trams stop right around the corner from the hotel and run everywhere. I only took the tram once but that's because I enjoy walking. The stroll up the main shopping street around the corner from the hotel to Dam square is so intoxicating, full of life and culture.
