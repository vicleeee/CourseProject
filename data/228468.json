The ambience of the hotel, however, is depressing - stark white walls that need painting, tattered carpeting in the hallways, a charge to use the computers, a very busy Gran V\u00eda just outside.

Can't beat that. The reception is great and friendly. I left my monopod when I checked out on 4/5/12 Ten days later (4/14) after visiting Barcelona and Seville, I returned to Madrid to catch a flight back to the Yankeeland the following day. I returned to the hotel and asked the reception whether the hotel staff found my monopod. To my surprise, the reception checked with the lost and found department immediately and told me that they kept my monopod. It was returned to me right away. Conclusion: Pros: Great location, reasonable price (when you book it early enough), and friendly reception. Cons: Small rooms, need more and bigger elavators. It was a bit annoying in the morning as I was located in the 10th floor. The two small elavators were not sufficient enough to accommodate checkout customers and customers going for breakfast at the same time.

Bkd hotel using GMTV website after trawling through loads of sites and after calling Sol Melia direct, GMTV website offered the best deal. Flt landed 1230am & Metro (underground) is only open from 0630 - 0130am so as 1st time to Madrid & didn't know where we were going we got a taxi to the hotel. 20-30 minute ride costs about 30 euros. We enjoyed the taxi ride it gave us a good view of the city and was interesting. However if you are on a budget I would recommend if you get to Madrid at anytime including our flight which got there at 1230 that you do take the plunge and try the Metro it takes about 1/2 hour although daunting at first it is so cheap only 2 euros from the airport to right to the centre of Madrid. The Metro maps are clear and easy to use, the ticket machines are easy to use and the staff that work there are friendly and helpful. We found Madrid very much like New York the Hotel is ideally located right on the Gran Via, There is no grand entrance simply a doorway but it is clean and the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. We saw many different staff during the 4 night stay and every one of them was extremely helpful. The rooms and clean and fine with a TV and hairdryer. They have Dove cream soap dispensers in the bathroom for use in the shower and Lux cream soap dispensers by the sink. So no need for soap (good to know if you want to cut down on liquids and stuff in your luggage) useful for us as we just did the 10kg handluggage free of charge on Ryan air, so not having to take a hairdryer was good. We had room 807 - 8th floor. Good view if you dared to look out of the windows which are very low if you open them and I would be a touch concerned if I had kids so if you take kids, keep the window locked and closed. The air con worked fab but only if the window was properly closed, so for other reviews I read about aircon not working, maybe their window wasn't closed properly. We didn't add breakfast to our booking and if you are not getting a very cheap deal don't, you can get breakfast ie toast, juice and coffee or eggs, bacon and toast juice and coffee for around 2euros -5 euros in all the nearby cafes. I believe the hotel charges 12 euros for a buffet breakfast, so if you like a big hearty breakfast then fine, but if not you can get away with a couple of euros at either Nebraska turn left walked a few yards up the road and cross over or in the tapas cafes on the same side of the road. The restaurant Diabocca turn left and cross the road but slightly further up is a great Italian and especially if you like to be served your food properly with a nice wine list. We found a shortage of high quality restaurants, but if you love Tapas (as you should do if you are visiting Spain) you will be fine. Beware the Plaza Mayor restaurants in the square can be a rip off for Tapas because of the setting, have a drink there but eat elsewhere - we had a meal there and it was our worst of the stay, you get better meals and restaurants away from the tourist attractions. Do the open top bus tour you can get the tickets in the hotel its 17euros for 1 day (includes both red and blue route) and can get on or off as many times as you like and it will give you a great sense or where everything is in Madrid. We brough the 2 day ticket for 21 euros - after that we became experts on the Metro, only 1 euro for each journey whereever you go in the city! great value. By the way there is a spa next door to the hotel which you can use for 17 euros a day but sometimes they have special offers on for afternoon use. Go in and ask. There is a pool on top of the hotel emperado but they charge 30 euros for a day if you are not hotel residents, not worth it. If you have time you can get the Metro up to Charmartin and go to the Tryp Centro North and use their pool - you need 10euros for a deposit for towels and its a bit concrete jungle, but if you really need to cool off you can do this, but I had a a note of the fact that I could do this from the GMTV booking so check you get the same deal with whoever you book with. Loved Madrid, although 3 nights would have been enough for us. I don't really do museaums and Art Gallerys, the parks are lovely the shops quite good and its clean (loads of graffiti though) If you are out passed Midnight the streets around the Gran Via have tons of prostitutes working who will approach any man that walks passed! Was a bit daunting the first night we got there when we went out for a late drink. I thought it was all very seedy, but by the next day you would never know that went on at night! I thought there would be more nightlife but it seemed to quite down by 1.00am ish. Street noise - loads of it from the hotel, but when you are in any City like New York, Madrid, London etc you expect that from a well located hotel, you get used to it. Or don't book a hotel with a central location and travel in to do your sightseeing! One thing we were amazed at is the young Spanish people - on a Sunday we couldn't believe how many of them fill the boot of their car with Booze and just park up anywhere they can and have a sort of street party, it was a bit scarey really, although we were at the Tryp Norte Central - using the pool when we saw this.

The room was very nice, the bathroom very modern and clean, the view over Gran Via is great and the walking distance to the touristic locations and shopping areas is very short! We took the metro to our hotel, and it went very well, although there are some constructions in the metro system, so we had to change two instead of one time! The breakfast at the Tryp Washington blew us away (compared to the Eduardo), there are so many choices in food, beverage and sweets! I read in some statements about the entrance hall being closed, so it was no suprise for us! We just checked in at the 4 stars Tryp next door! The hotels are connected, so that was no problem!

Demanding travelers who require sumptuous elegance both inside and out and who rely on obsequious hotel staff fretting over their every need will not enjoy this hotel. Clearly, scaffolding surrounds the fascade of both it and its sister hotel, the Tryp Menfis, and access to the Washington remains through the Menfis. Those details aside, the Washington boasts that feature which is most important to American travelers in Europe--a moderately sized, comfortably modern room. Ours boasted a double bed, new hard wood flooring, plenty of closet and storage space, updated electricity (with three additional outlets for heating pads, curling irons, etc.), AIR CONDITIONING THAT WORKED, a mini bar, a comfortable marble bath with high water pressure showerhead and abundant hot water, and reliable maid service. Two metro lines are withing minutes of the property, which is located at the western end of the Gran V\u00eda near Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, La Palacio Real, and the Opera district --where are located a range of lovely outdoor restaurants overlooking the palace. The hotel offers a breakfast service for 9E; however we preferred to purchase couissants from a local market and coffee from the (SURPRISE) Starbucks across the street, which saved both money and precious time. Another plus is that, though by no means out of the way, the hotel is significantly distanced from the throngs of tourists and Madrillenos that gather at venues such as Sol and Plaza de Cibeles and Plaza Mayor and Telef\u00f3nica Gran V\u00eda. Yet, those attractions are a comfortable stroll or convenient metro ride away. Also convenient is the presence, next door, of a local travel agency that offers inexpensive and informative day trips to locations beyond Madrid such as Toledo, Avila, Segovia, and El Escorial--which I heartily recommend to complete your central Spain experience. I heartily recommend the Tryp Washington and would not hesitate to stay there again upon future visits to this vibrant European capitol.", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel.\u201d", "Author": "RandBrad", "ReviewID": "UR5298354", "Content": "This is a very good place to stay, and reasonably priced (on Expedia).

The breakfast, which was included, was AWESOME, making the overall stay an excellent value! The location was great, and about 50 yards to the subway entrance, which is a great way to get around Madrid. We could walk to many of the sites we wanted to see. The fact that the Tryp Washington lobby was closed for renovation was no problem at all. You simply enter through the Tryp Menfis lobby, take the elevator to your floor, and walk through a doorway in the hallway to get to your room. The desk staff was friendly enough, but didn't exactly go out of their way to be welcoming or helpful. One note of warning (and not the fault of the hotel): it is impossible to get a taxi from this hotel to the train station.

When we arrived the hotel was blacked out, covered in scaffolding with not a soul to be found. We had to make our journey to the hotel through another hotel next door.(The two hotels appeared to be being merged). When we arrived at the hotel they had no record of our booking and we spent a long time trying to establish the problem (thank god my friend spoke Spanish). On our journey from reception to the room, there were various disappointing sights including holes in the celling and plaster board falling off the walls, and a very dodgy lift not very pleasant at all. When we arrived at the room our electricty had also failed. The staff were helpful with regards to this matter and the problem was sorted quickly. The rooms are of good size and the bathrooms are nice, we also had a balcony with a disappointing view over a side street. Some members of staff were extremly rude, including one who refused to let us leave our suitcases in reception after we had checked out. The day manager however was very nice and helped us with making various sightseeing arrangements. One positive thing about this hotel was that it was quiet, something hard to find in a bustling city.
