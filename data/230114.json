At first the service was okay but when I got my pork and was asked if the food was okay I dared to say no. The meat was only a piece of fat, maybe one forth of it was eatable but with a lot of effort to free the meat from the fat. The first service lady asked if she good bring me something else instead, which would have been a good idea. Unfortunately, the other lady refused this and said of course I could order anything else but had to pay. And she gave me a full lecture of how pork had to be. I mean this wasn't the first piece of pork in my life. I hardly touched the meat, but she didn't even offer a free dessert or a coffee. My colleague told me later that she had once the beef burger and it was also awful. So maybe stay in this hotel if you don't mind the location but never, never EAT there.

I stayed here with work for 3 days and decided to continue over the weekend for pleasure. As it was a fairly last minute booking there was not much else available at decent prices in the city centre. Having said that, it was absolutely fine for what it was. Room: On arrival I was upgraded to a premier room on the 7th floor. This was fine but the room was quite small and it made me wonder what the standard rooms are like. I did not like the repeat pattern of a 16th century type male on the bathroom door, which gave me nightmares at night - it was also repeated in the corridor outside - my husband also commented that he didn't like it either. Service: I couldn't fault the service at the front desk - they lent several UK / europe adaptors to me as I'd forgotten mine, and also dealt with a rather complicated bill at the end of my stay where I needed to split out all the charges between work and personal credit cards (they had already pre-charged my work card for some reason for the entire stay). Food and beverages: I felt the choice on the room service menu was poor and therefore we chose to eat in the restaurant downstairs at lunch on two days when I was working and in a hurry. I can't fault the burgers - they were huge and fully loaded (probably highly calorific). Location: I noted some people mentioned previously that this hotel is very far away from public transport. This is untrue. It is served by both the trams - take the road to the right, cross over the road bridge and you can get the number 15 into town through the Der Pijp area - and the metro - take the road to the left and take the number 51 into town - which are both about 5 minutes' walk away. Both journeys take about 15 mins into the city centre. Clearly you're not going to stay here if you can stay in town - but it was fine for what we needed. The only thing I missed was being able to come back late afternoon to freshen up and change for dinner, but it wasn't a major problem. You can also get taxis to and from the centre for about 15-20 euros. The hotel can also arrange a pre-paid taxi voucher for 33 euros to the airport, which is a lot cheaper than the the 52 euros I was charged on the way from the airport to the hotel.

Well appointed, nicely stocked bathroom with all the 'goodies' and Premier guests get slippers, a fluffy bathrobe and a litre of mineral water on top of the usual room facilities.

The hotel is outside Amsterdam Centre {was told it was 2 kilometres} but it was easy to get to the centre by public transport. If you went left outside the hotel and walked about 7 minutes you came to the Overamstel metro station. Trains are every 10 mins. (including Sunday) and the journey is just 10 mins on train no.51 to Central Station which is opposite the Dam Rak. (Coming back you need train 51 destination Westwijk) Downside is that the station is automated so you need to read all the signs carefully to make sure you get on the right train and use the ticket machine. If you went right outside hotel & walked about 7 mins. over the bridge there were trams that went to centre of Amsterdam, we did not use this so cannot comment on it but was told it was easy and took about 30 minutes to Amsterdam Centre. We went to Schipol Airport on the metro train from Overamstel to Amsterdam Central & then train to the airport whole trip only took 40 minutes and cost about quarter of the 45 euros the taxi cost us when we arrived. (Taxi took about 20 mins.) As this hotel was outside the centre it was quiet at night enabling good nights sleep.

The metro stop about 10 min walk from the hotel(with a stroller). Go out the front door turn left. You can buy the tickets at the front desk. Con: No where to eat around the hotel. It is located in an industrial area. Have breakfast at the hotel, but make sure you eat before returning to the hotel. The hotel restaurant is expense. I did find a small snack cafe across the bridge(turn right outside of the hotel and over the bridge) that was good, but other than that the only restaurant(which was recommended by the hotel staff) required reservations. Overall: Good value, we got a special weekend rate that included the breakfast. It is on the outskirts of Amsterdam, but a short metro ride into the city. I would recommend doing a hop on and hop off canal bus in Amsterdam. Pick up Rick Steves travel guide for Amsterdam, it was very helpful.

We did upgrade to the club room, so I'm not sure whether this impacted the size of our room, but I have to say that it was very large by European standards. The included breakfast was a great way to start the day: eggs, meat, toast, cereal, fruits, yogurt ... I ate more than my fair share. The only down side is that you are a bit out of the city. The tram does run close to the hotel, and you can't miss your stop at the end of the line (helpful after the coffehouse), but it's about a 5 minute walk from the tram to the hotel over a bridge. It was a little frustrating having to abide by the tram schedule while on vacation, but I think overall worthwhile to get to stay in such a great place.
