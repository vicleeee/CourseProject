The location for getting out and about is great and ideal for using the Park and Ride at the fashion centre which was just a short tram trip away. Room good size, clean and well presented. Staff very approachable and friendly. HOWEVER as mentioned in some other posts beware of the outside noise. We were given a room overlooking the rear street and the noise from drunken revellers until 3-4am was very bad. Worse is the taxi drivers who just sit outside blaring their horns in a random manner and just as you get off to sleep the trams start up at 6! - think the hotel should mention this in their literature and fit double glazing. We spoke to reception and without question moved us to a quieter room overlooking the canal - this side of the hotel was in complete contrast to where we had been (even double glazing fitted !), almost as if two hotels were operating in the same location. Finally on checking out beware of the city tax despite having booked through hotels.com and having an invoice saying all taxes etc included you will be expected to pay a further (5%) when you check out.

We were on the 6th floor with great views from a lovely sitting area of Amsterdam and one of its canals. The hotel was spotlessly clean with a lovely bar area and a separate restaurant. All the staff members we met were very friendly and could not do enough for us. We had lunch and one breakfast in the art d\u00c3\u00a9cor restaurant and both times it was wonderful. The bar was a lovely haven to enjoy a drink or two and a bar snack after a busy day sightseeing in Amsterdam. The hotel itself is in a lovely area (The Leidseplein) close to lots of shops, restaurants and bars.

What is a very grand location is supported by a bland could be anywhere approach - it could have been any charmless provincial hotel. I was very disappointed to find the junior suite doubled up as a conference room and therefore had all the charm and ambience of an insurance office. Even the bed (reasonably comfortable) was a fold up - one picture on the wall and no mirror in the room. For the money I could have done better.

On the Sunday night my husband, who is diabetic, had a very severe hypo - very low blood sugars with fitting. Help arrived as soon as I rang down. Two very well trained members of staff, Paul and Ribiqa, helped me with my husband until the paramedics arrived, and saw us out to the ambulance. They dealt with the drama of a guest going out of the 4th floor window calmly and efficiently - it couldn't have been smoother. Ribiqa packed a bag for us, and all staff facilitated our exit well. The hotel rang the hospital to see how we were, paid for our taxi and welcomed us back even though it was gone midnight.Food and drink was provided free of charge, and all night staff showed a huge degree of concern. The follow up was amazing too. We saw managers and general managers who knew all about it, asked after my husband's progress, and took the time to sit with us and chat. The kindness and care shown was completely genuine. I can't thank all those involved enough. Paul took especial care to make sure the rest of our trip was good. I feel like we have made friends through this somewhat traumatic experience. We plan to stay at the hotel whenever we go to Holland now. We travel there a number of times a year to see our son, and really appreciate the good choice we made. The hotel is so central, and you can get a bus to the airport for only 4 Euros from just outside. We had no problems with noise, and slept very well. The room was always cleaned, no matter what time of day we left it. And a tip for those who thought it was a bit 'tired'.

If you are planning on staying out late to party in Amsterdam, none of this will be a problem. We weren't, and it was. But, this was not the hotel's fault, and they moved us to a different room for our second night. The second room was on the canal side of the hotel and, while not as interesting, was also very large, with two queen beds. We slept wonderfully. Breakfast in the beautiful dining room was expensive, but there was a lot of very good food to choose from. The room service continental breakfast for 1 could easily feed 2 people.

We enquired about local parking facilities as we had drove (8 hours!) and wanted to move the car from outside the building.

We decided to take a look at the rooms as we were all tired from a long day of travelling. Our room was nice and clean although in need of some restoration but it was comfortable. The room was very hot during our stay and we were disappointed to find that the window did not open. I know its winter but it can get quite stuffy when there is heating on. The was a thermostat on the wall which we lowered but it didnt seem to make a difference. The amenities were good, coffee and tea making facilities were in the room as well as a hairdryer, TV (with quite a few english speaking channels), mini bar (over priced but arent they all!) and iron and ironing board. My sister returned to reception to enquire about getting a double room which they still had available. When they went to view the room, the standard wasnt as good as the twin so they decided to keep the original. The staff in the restaurant/bar were very friendly and attentive. When checking out, a different receptionist dealt with us and she was polite and efficient. The porter, who help us with our bags at check out was also very nice.

Also a much more up market location and nicer place to stay than if we had picked somewhere in central amsterdam. Having said that central Amsterdam was still only 15 mins walk away and that was where the red light district was, thats if you wanted to have a look and a laugh! Or even quicker by trams which were convieniently located directly outside the hotel - numbers 1, 2 and 5 would get you there. There were some of the main museums very close by including the Van Gough and also there was an area near by that had a comedy cafe and a Hard Rock cafe. The other places of interest to myself like the Anne Frank house were still all within walking distance. In fact no where is really too far to walk, and the walks themselves are very pleasant admiring the different architcture of the buildings, churches and houses. Just watch out for the bikes, they come flying around every corner and everyone seems to own one young and old! Would definately stay at this hotel again, loved it and the location.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel in a Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Sara M", "ReviewID": "UR122573376", "Content": "We stayed her for New Years Eve as the balconies have a great view for the fireworks that go off all across the city.

The hotel location is perfect, the building beautiful -always people taking photos while we were on our great spacious balcony.

When we first started travelling to Amsterdam we always admired this hotel, honestly, it is a beautiful building and right on the doorstep of Leidesplein. We stayed on the 9th December 2011 for 3 nights. There is not alot more I can add to this review as I have previously stated all the benefits of staying at this hotel already. The history of this hotel is fascinating & if you are interested in it, the lobby has a huge wall dedicated to what the hotel was used for, has been, the construction etc. Worth a read. The room we were given was a little smaller than our previous stay, however, as a travel agent I did request a room overlooking the canal/any room upgrades, we received a balcony room overlooking the canal which was beautiful! It is very quiet & peaceful, somewhat cold however in the month of December. Our room was cleaned daily by maid service, everything restocked & replenished in the bathroom. There is tea/coffee making facilities in the room, after a long day walking and exploring this is welcome! As always the beds are just to die for, we always end up sleeping most of the time we are here as the beds are just so comfy & inviting! See my last review for more details, you will not be dissapointed with these beds I can assure you. We were only on a Room only basis, as breakfast is extortinately priced we feel. It is about 20 Euros per person, per day to do so, we were quite happy to hop over the Sports Cafe (formally a Pancake corner) to eat a full english or local pancakes for about & Euros each. We paid the local tax on arrival which was about 20 Euros. They do try and take a deposit of about 100 Euros a day to cover ''incidentals'' off some form of credit/debit card - we always have argued this with them on arrival as neither time have we booked this hotel has it stated it in the contract that this is to be exepcted (as a travel agent I am pretty firmed up on things like this!) nor do we ever use things such as the mini bar etc. We politely refused and the receptionist locked the mini bar so we were not able to use this. You do need to be firm with them to make them realise you do not wish to have a ''hold deposit'' on your card details though. This year Amsterdam have really gone to town with Christmas, in previous years we have always had an ice skating rink just a few 100 metres from the hotel, this year it was like a full-on Christmas market on Leidesplein, it did seem a lot busier attracting alot of tourists! We always enjoy staying at this hotel, paticularly for the area. Our favourite coffeeshop is The Bulldog and the hotel is a stones throw away, plus there are so many bars and restaraunts you really have a choice! We paticularly like to visit the Thai, Mai Thai everytime we travel here as the food is good & reasonably priced. Overall, as stated before we would have absolutley no hesitation in staying at this hotel & will ALWAYS be our first choice for accommodation in this delightful city.

We had a drink every night in the bar and again the service and atmosphere were great.

The breakfast was taken for two days in a meeting room which was odd and very unattractive whilst the main dining room was being prepared for Christmas day.

It is directly next door to the concert hall/theatre, and about 10 mins walk from the museum quarter, about 15 mins walk from the Bloenmarkt (floating flower markets). The rooms are tastefully decorated in an art deco/nouveau style, and the usual amenities: mini bar, electronic safe, tea/coffee making facilities, shower gel, shampoo. No dressing gown, slippers or iron though. Tv has good selection of channels for English speakers; BBC1, BBC2, Animal Planet, MTV, CNN. Our room 119, had a nice walk out balcony with chairs, that overlooked the fountains outside- was a little noisy at night. There are computers available on the mezzanine floor with internet access free of charge and phone chargers for most makes on the desks. And that's about all I can say positive about this hotel as we had a terrible stay.... My partner and I booked a 2 night stay at this hotel through lastminute.com after searching through hundreds of hotels in Amsterdam looking for one that was wheelchair accessible- my partner is disabled. This hotel lists itself as having wheelchair accessible rooms on both it's own website and with lastminute.com. We thoroughly checked this before booking so felt confident to go ahead and book. In the special requests box we requested a wheelchair accessible room, and explained that my partner was wheelchair bound. Upon arriving in Amsterdam, we were horrified to find that the hotel DID NOT have a wheelchair accessible entrance. We were faced with a flight of stairs to the main entrance. I went in and checked at reception for the wheelchair entrance and was informed that the hotel was not wheelchair accessible. I explained to the receptionist-Martha (who was actually very helpful) that we had booked a wheelchair accessible room. She informed me that they do have wheelchair accessible rooms but the hotel is not wheelchair accessible!!! Totally crazy! After much frantic calling to various people in the hotel she arranged for the concierge and a member of the bar staff, to bring my partner in through the bar entrance and then they would carry my partner up the smaller flight of stairs in the bar! I'm sure anyone reading this can imagine how humiliating this was for my partner. This was to be the plan for our entire stay at the hotel. Upset and tired from traveling, we reluctantly agreed as it seemed we had no other option. We went out and enjoyed the day in Amsterdam, and returned to the hotel. It took the staff 15minutes to let us in through the bar, and that only happened because I banged on the door! We called lastminute immediately to complain, and try to get moved to a more appropriate accommodation. Lastminute contacted the hotel manager to try and get us moved, but he refused to refund our money, so we were forced to stay for the 2 nights. Very inconsiderate, and selfish attitude. I can't believe they wouldn't let us cancel our stay and move to an accessible hotel. Later that evening we ate in the restaurant, as we were reluctant to tackle the whole entrance saga thing again. Surprise, surprise no wheelchair access! In order to access the restaurant we had to report to reception, and someone would then take us in the lift to the service entrance. In the restaurant, the service was appalling. We were sat at the table for 10minutes with no menu, and no drinks. We had to catch a member of the restaurant team and ask them to bring us menus and order drinks. We found the menu had little choice and was really quite pricey: starters approx 16 euros, main course from approx 20 euros. We opted for the 2 course set menu option. My partner went for the fish option and I went for the Roasted Poussin- what a mistake! When it arrived, i cut it open and the centre appeared raw, so I poked a finger in, and it came out with blood on it!. I tried a couple of times to catch a member of staff but had no luck. I decided to not eat it and let the waitress know when she came to clear the plates. When I informed her that it was undercooked, her response was 'that it's meant to be that way'!!!! Obviously not heard of salmonella in Amsterdam. Total bill was 67 euros for 2 courses with 3 glasses of wine, and I had barely touched the main course. Then we attempted to get back to our room on the 1st floor, and yes you guessed it- another saga. The restaurant manager took us to the service lift and sent us up to the 1st floor. When we stepped out of the lift we were faced with a flight of stairs! It was not accessible straight from the restaurant. The next night we decided to eat in the bar. Better choice of menu, and nice surroundings. Walls are covered in photos of celebrity visitors to the hotel so quite a nice talking point. In addition to my partner as company, we also had mice! Yes mice. Whilst sat in the bar we watched mice wander into the main area and then scurry back into what looked like a store cupboard. Luckily they don't bother me but if you are not partial to the furry kind then you might want to give the bar a miss, as when another resident reported it to the bar staff, he told her 'yes we do have problem with mice, I will try and catch it if it comes out again' .!! We hated every minute of staying in this hotel, and the hotel manager did not so much as offer us a complimentary meal or any discount off our final bill, for the humiliation and inconvenience we faced during our stay. Would never stay here again, and would certainly not recommend it.

We would throughly recommend the Heineken Experience which was great value for money and drinks included. The room in the hotel was extremely clean, maid service daily and was excellent. No problems in this respect. We had a room at the rear but this made no odds because you only use your room as a base as there is so much exploring to do in a short space of time.

Reception was very good and the staff very pleasant and accommodating. My room was on the top floor, which was nice, in one of the extension wings of the hotel. Initially I took the closest elevators to the reception but then found that I had to walk some way and up some stairs to my room. My room, small but neat with all the requisite facilities, overlooked a canal and had a small balcony and en suite bathroom. Corridor noise was low, despite being close to an elevator. Breakfast was not included but I took this downstairs as part of a buffet option. I was in early and the room itself is well appointed though the maitre d'hotel seemed tired and relatively uninterested. The coffee was wonderful, the baked goods, presumably from in house were good but there wasn't a lot of variety. The hot and cold plates were adequate but not very imaginative and certainly on the fruits and cheeses aspect this seemed to be somewhat thin in terms of variety. The usual cereals were on offer and some interesting meats including a 'bucket' of cooked bacon. The cured meats were very good. The bar is vibey, with average pricing and an interesting array of photographs of various celebrities on the wall. This is a great people watching location as is the outdoor seating in front of the cafe. The hotel provides good wifi in tranches of one hour access at a time. The cable TV services are below par but the internet cafe services on the mezzanine are designed for capacity and have good equipment. The Eden group indicate that they have spend considerable monies on upgrading the hotel but these upgrades are not very self evident , perhaps they were mostly undertaken in the infrastructure and not in the amenities.

Truly, it is perfect - everything w/i walking distance. Most of the staff super friendly - shout-out to Irene, at the front desk who was superb. Concierge and evening housekeeping also fabulous. One particularly grumpy front desk clerk stood out as rude, unhappy, and the opposite energy of what you would want at a front desk. Room service tried hard but lacked the grace of nicer hotels (not muting the line to talk to a colleague and so I heard loud shouting in Dutch while I was trying to place an order). I think his English might not have been that great either based on the comparison of the order to what we received but... this is Amsterdam, not the US. However, considering the hotel touts its \"American\"-ness in the lobby and name, you would expect some familiarity with the fact that people like butter/jam with toast and when I say brown toast, I mean wheat bread (as is normally described in many European hotels). The food is really not great at all - but, Amsterdam isn't known for its food. Trip Advisor recommendations were great though on this point though. The main issue of the hotel was the horrible horrible bed. Mom has a sensitive back and so we requested a board be put under the mattress to help with this (most hotels I've encountered seemed very familiar and happy to accomodate such a request) but it didn't help at all. Mom ended up putting the mattress on the floor - didn't help. Then, she tried sleeping on the mattress cover on the floor and that wasn't great but it was the 3rd night and we were leaving. I do not have a sensistive back but even I was very stiff and uncomfortable after sleeping on the what seemed to be a very old mattress. I did comment about the poor mattress but let's face it - what more can they do?? Upon checking, we were upgraded to a renovated larger room which was very very nice and much appreciated - unfortunately, the lighting was horrible. The phone had a very loud hum which made it diffficult to use (also shared this info w/ staff but no changes during our visit). And.. the bathrrom was fine enough but... seriously, has anyone from the hotel ever tried to take a shower in there? The showerhead auto pivots to face the interior shower wall with low very pressure.... how are you supposed to wash your hair!? It is a good size hotel so renovations must be costly but I see a big need - hall carpets old and worn, etc. Irene and the evening houskeeping gentleman who helped with the beds (apologies for not catching his name!) shone though and I managed to leave with a pleasant enough feeling but... wouldn't stay again unless they commit to a new mattress in the room.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cJazz Brunch highly recommended!\u201d", "Author": "Steveonholiday_9", "ReviewID": "UR115427153", "Content": "We visited the hotel in June as group of 12 friends celebrating a 50th birthday.

The room we had (king bed - standard room) appeared quite a bit bigger than the website photo and was very comfy. The bathroom was very good. My perception of the inside of the hotel was more like a typical Doubletree property. Not quite 4 or 5 star but solid and nice. We asked for much help from the concierge in terms of directions, assistance with luggage, etc., and received fabulous service. The hotel is *supurbly* located. You can walk to the Riks Museum and Van Gogh. The street car can be picked up right out front to get you to other parts of the city. It is worth noting that it is right on the Liedsplein, a very active nightlife area in the city. If you want to be tucked away from the action, this may not be the choice for you but I would add our room was very quiet. The restaurant in the hotel is somewhat pricey but we enjoyed sitting outside in the cafe and people watching. Enjoy Amsterdam! It's one of the great cities in the world.

The front desk on our few occasions we needed them, they simply could not have been better. The room was clean, beautiful but small by North American standards but as I am typing this from Paris it was great by European standards. Now the bed, I travel for a living and find myself in hotels up to 30 weeks a year and this bed has moved to the top of the list (I may even consider returning just to sleep in it again).

If you are looking for something more American. There is a Hard Rock cafe 5 minutes away. I would recommend getting a 96 hour Tram Chip Card. This will allow you travel all over the city.

Rooms were, I though, fairly large by Amsterdam standards (see pictures), the bath was nicely large as well. There was also a minibar, with EXTREMELY high prices (e.g. 4euro, almost $6, for 0.3 liter of Coke). The bed was comfortable and actually KING size, and was accompanied by a desk, two chairs (one at the desk), a dresser with flatscreen TV (many channels in English), and a decent sized closet with door. I appreciated that there were many lights and lamps, all of which could be controlled from switches right by the bed. This is a first class hotel in a prime location. The Leidseplein is at the intersection of tram lines, which makes it very convenient to get to varied locations around the city. It is also walking distance to many attractions, including casinos and museums. The Leidseplein itself is filled with bars and restaurants, from less expensive \"fast\" food restaurants (and, heaven forbid! U.S. chains like Macdonald's and Burger King) to very nice restaurants and quant bars and pubs. On a nice day, much of the plein is also filled with tables and chairs so you can eat/drink outdoors. But, going into the Leidseplein is not required, as the hotel itself has a lovely, if pricey, restaurant and bar, and its own outdoor service. The staff was very warm and welcoming, trying very hard to make the stay comfortable. Housekeeping was thorough and well done. This was one of the first hotels that I have run across in years in Europe that also had ice machines on every other floor! It is amazing at how hard it is to get ice, even in restaurants. This little feature made a lot of difference. Internet, wired, was available but expensive (18 euro for 24 hours contiguous, or 10 euro for 60 minutes non-consecutively during a 24-hour period). Service was fast and easy to connect. Even though I was on the fourth floor, I could still hear the tram noises.

Our experiences were completely positive from the very first moment (when we arrived to find our room was not quite ready, Reception immediately offered us a free drinks voucher and repeated that when it was still not ready less than half-an-hour later) until the end (our luggage was whisked away so that we could make use of our free time until departing for the airport). This hotel rose to every challenge. Any requests were greeted politely, gently and courteously with an \"Of course!\" reply. All the staff were friendly, but even more so once we had seen them a couple of times. The hotel was frequently extremely busy with locals and visitors but the staff still maintained a professional approach and service was usually prompt. The beautiful restaurant offered a comprehensive breakfast (we were offered a seasonal discount by Reception which we accepted), with all manner of cereals, cold and hot dishes, breads and pastries, juices and drinks - including champagne! - so we were astonished that some members had felt that breakfast was too expensive. Dinner was most enjoyable but we did feel that perhaps chef could have offered daily specials or that there could have been greater variety. Our fourth floor room was large, well appointed, quiet and comfortable. The en-suite was clean, the water almost instantly hot and the towels large and comforting. The mini bar was comprehensively stocked but Reception didn't pick up that we had used a large bag of crisps until we told them that we had. There was occasional \"bell\" noise from the trams outside (probably most noticeable in the morning). The tip by members to get the 370 bus from the airport was a very good suggestion. We did so to the Eden and back. Members need to be aware that the road from the airport is very smooth but has quite a few bends and, unless you can get a seat, coping with cases can be tricky. The Eden is ideally situated for access to the canal system, museums and shopping centres, either on foot or by using the buses or trams.

We had a king room that overlooked the canal (although there was a giant tree in the way so we didn't have much of a canal view). Our room was larger than I thought it would be, given the previous reviews. The bathroom, however; was tiny. It was hard to have two people in the bathroom at once. Also, my husband really disliked the bathtub. He is tall, and although the shower was a good height, the bathtub itself was narrow with a slopin floor, making it hard for him to stand with his feet level. His front or back part of his foot had to edge up the side of the tub to stand under the shower. Having \"dainty\" feet myself, I didn't have this problem, but it was very annoying for him. The location of this hotel is very convienent to a lot of activities that we wanted to do while in Amsterdam. The night life around the hotel is booming, but not close enough to cause a lot of noise. The canal boats are right along side the hotel, and the hotel is only a few minutes walk to Reijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum. (Buy your tickets early at the Tourist aide shop just a block down from the hotel, near the giant outdoor seating area -- and you won't have to wait in line!) The canals around the hotel are very picturesque. The hotel itself if very historic and quite beautiful in the old art deco style. The American Cafe, and room service, are outrageously expensive. Our pizza was about 20 euros (but delicious late at night). I recommend going to the Pancake House or the cafe near the opera, a few blocks down from the hotel. We did not have any problems with bed bugs, as one reviewer mentioned, and although we didn't have very many dealings with the staff, they were curteous and efficient in check in and check out. I would stay here again - but would make sure that we got the cheap prepaid rate like we did this time. The room service/cafe prices are outrageous, as is the wifi. (20 euros!)

On leaving the airport follow the signs for buses and stop in at one of the news shops who will sell you a stripenkart, 7.50 Euros for 15 strips. At the bus stop there is a big electronic sign telling you which bus stop each bus is so easy to find where you need to go. When the bus turns up hand your stripenkart and tell the driver you want to go to Leidseplein, he will stamp 5 strips and hand it back to you. There is a screen on the bus that tells you which stop is next so easy to know when to get off. The Leidseplein stop is directly outside the American Hotel and its that simple. You can use 5 strips getting back to the airport and use the other 5 on trams getting around the city and always buy another stripenkart if you need to. The hotel location is ideal for the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, House of Bols, Heineken Experience and a host of bars and restaurants in and around Leidseplein. Its also a 30 minute walk to red light district and about the same to Anne Frank house. Out the back entrance is also the stop for the Hop on Hop off canal boat cruise which is a great way to see the city. The boats have commentary ( In English ) so provide a guided tour also and cost 20 Euros and are available to use 24 hours from purchase. There are 3 different lines you can ride green, red and blue and stop at all the notable landmarks Muesemplein, Central station, Anne Frank house to name a few.

CHECK-IN: It's a 3pm check-in. We had a 9am flight which had us at the hotel by 10:30am. Our room was not available, but with our names in we were told to come back after 12:00 and they'd try to get us in early. We got back by 1:30pm and they had our room ready. Staff were friendly and accommodating. ROOM: We had #116, which is a great canal-side room with a balcony. The bed was comfortable and the room large for European standards. The bathroom was fine with great water pressure, however we were traveling in December and there wasn't a heater directly in the bathroom - which meant the air was a bit chilly for the morning shower. No noise to speak of - couldn't hear neighbors or the streets outside. The black-out curtains worked great to keep city lights and morning sun out. LOCATION: Great location. Convenient to Leidseplein, trams and walkable to the Dam. A completely safe area, well-lit. PROPERTY: The hotel is well-maintained. There's a bar on-site and the cafe is well-known it's own right. There was a large holiday party going on at the time - the staff took care to make sure that hotel guests were not bothered by noise or the crowd by leaving a note in rooms advising of the festivities and who to call if anything was a problem. A rare proactive approach. PLUSES: Location, access to trams. Staff were friendly and helpful. MINUSES: If you get an \"inside\" room, you will have a truly ugly view of interior walls. The \"canal\" and \"external\" rooms are absolutely recommendable, but not sure how you can guarantee you get one. We just booked an internet sale deal and lucked out. BOOKING: $132/night via Expedia. We booked over 60 days in advance and got a pretty amazing deal.

We have been to Amsterdam many times before so we already know whats about & where, that is why we chose the Eden American Hotel on Leidesplein. Perfect positioning if you want to be close to the nightlife, museums & shopping areas of Amsterdam - Leidesplein is definitley one of the less 'seedier' places you can stay in Amsterdam & I definitley feel safe! One thing I should point out which was a bit naughty of the hotel was that they asked for 90 euros a day for 'incidentals' on a credit card. Well firstly, we don't own a credit card & secondly this was never stated when booking the hotel directly on it's own website. Luckily they reduced this to 90 euros during the hotel stay & accepted a debit card. They did give us the option of paying it in cash, however we felt this was a little unfair as we had brought the money to spend outside of the hotel. This was the only critism that I had of the hotel. We were placed on a 'vip' list as we were celebrating my birthday (albiet a month later!) but we were placed in the most fantastic room! Room 109 was perfect for a view over the canal & watching the hustle and bustle down below. We were also given a voucher that entitled us to a free drink in the main bar. We were going to use this, however we lost it on the day we were going to use it. Typical! There was a little sitting area and a huge window that was fab for relaxing on. The usuals of a working desk & internet connections, those you would of a four star hotel. I must move on to something, that was quite spectacular, and this object was the king sized bed! Although Im sure it was MUCH bigger?! It was the comfiest bed known to man - so please be warned if you stay here you may outsleep your alarm or wake up call! The bathroom was nice and equipped with a bath/shower, toilet and sink, of a small size but did its job & plenty of towels were provided. There were nice toiletries made by a company called 'rituals', you will find this shop walking around leidestraat area & upto the flower market. There was also a safe, tea/coffe facilities, mini bar, LCD tv which catered for all languages, Animal Planet being on frequently! The hotel does have its own restaraunt, bar & cafe, however we did not have the pleasure in going in them as the menu was a little pricey, however this is what you would expect of a 4 star hotel, but apparently the food is devine! They also had a gym/fitness room which clients could use. Overall this hotel is in a perfect location, has fab staff & the hosptiality is second to none. We will DEFINTLEY be returning to this hotel hopefully on our next trip to Amsterdam - which is once a year! We just love the place & this wonderful hotel.

There was a photoexhibition and authograph book of previous musicans, popstars who'd stayed there! All members of the staff were helpful and friendly. We stayed in Room 130, it wasa good size, an internal room, with one window overlooking a rooftop - we slept well! My daughter shared the room, but essentially had her own annex. We booked 21 days in advance on the dutch website Hotels.nl and got a really good deal. The two nights for the three of us cost about 250 euro incl. taxes. In Leidesplein, there are two streets with lots of restaurants and pubs, We went to a dutch restaurant \"Stoop Stoop\" excellent food! It is possible to sit outside in the square. Also there was a pan cake house across the street - which was wonderful for breakfast! The trams stop right outside the hotel. We bought a \"strippenkart\" in the newagents -there is a little machine in the tram to stick the ticket into! The Hotel is near Vondel Park, the Van Gogh museum and Rijksmuseum - a ten minute walk. Also, outside the door of the hotel is the Canal Cruise boats. You can hop on and off at various attractions! We went to see the Anne Frank house. This was a high priority for us and my daughter as she's reade various editions of Ann's diary. The queque moved quickly. It was at times a bit overwhelming for my daughter but she found it inspiring. It is easy to travel on the train from the airport to Central Station and get Tram No 5 outside the station. The airport bus also stops outside the hotel. Schipol is an easy airport to get around.

Good location, nice rooms, great dinning options and attentive staff. The hotel is very cool from an architectural standpoint and sits on the southern edge of the Liedesplien- with a nice fountain in front. It is definitely the more upscale side of the square and is very pretty while offering great people watching from the outdoor cafe. And it is close to everything- Melkweg and theaters, restaurants, Bulldog, canal boat dock steps away, Museums, trolley stop,etc. I think I paid for the deluxe vs the standard room- and it was great- on the 5th floor with a little balcony overlooking the square. The breakfast was in the amazing dinning room but in good weather all other meals are outside at cafe American. Breakfast was a big spread of self serve which I frankly prefer to ala cart, coffee and tea brought by a waiter. But the cafe has waiters and such. And as an American you do have to remember to slow down a bit when at the cafe- the point is to milk it. So if it takes a while for the guy to come take your order, don't fret. If you want quick- go across the square to McD's. Found the staff helpful, courteous and attractive. Very used to storing bags and helping out. A few hints for travelers: 1. You enter the trams on the second to last car- there is a conductor sitting in a little booth there- you buy and validate your tickets there. 2. Bikes rule here. They are the top of the food chain. They will run you down- always be aware of your place on the street- do not stand in the bike lane. You might think it is a sidewalk- it isn't. But cars and trams will go out of their way to brake for you and expect you to take the initiative and right of way. 3. If you have done some urban biking- rent a bike. If not- stick to canal boats and walking - maybe ease into it with a guided tour. Biking is a fantastic way to see the city- especially the edges- zoo, museums, Pijps, Jordann, etc. Would avoid the Centre.

The \"Classic\" room was small, but perfectly fine...the Deluxe room was huge with a large bed, plenty of storage, 2 stuffed wing-back chairs with small table in between, large desk & a flat-screen TV atop a dresser with several drawers...a sewing kit & a shoe mitt was in one of the drawers. The view was of the Ticket booth & the canal where canal tours start from. The bathroom was not huge, but there was enough room for all our toiletries. Since we were celebrating a birthday, we decided to splurge on the Deluxe room. There was an iron/board & an electric pot for instant coffee or tea. There is an in-room safe & a minibar. There was ice available on the floor above. They provide 1 robe & 1 pair of nice slippers. The towels were large & thick, but if you want face cloths you may have to ask for them. They do not provide small bottles of shampoo...there is a plastic container attached to the wall that you have to push to get the shampoo to come out. They do provide 2 small bars of soap & some lotion. The rooms were very clean. I did not like the hair dryer! We did not eat in any of the hotel restaurants, but the small cafe & the outdoor seating with a view of the large fountain in front of the hotel was always busy. The hotel is convenient to a lot of sights...The Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, Vondelpark & the hotel is just steps away from the Leidesplein...a lively square with tons of cafes where you can sit outside & people watch, there are all types of restaurants & a parade of street performers. We liked Ristorante Peppino..we had the veal & eggplant dish...we also liked the Satellite Sports Cafe..bottle of Bud 3,90e. We were warned strongly at reception when we were leaving for the airport that the Connexxion Shuttle was unreliable, but we had paid 45e R/T for 2 people so were worried that they would not come to take us to the airport...well, we were surprised that instead of a shuttle, they sent a private car to whisk us to Schiphol. If you do use this service pay by credit card just in case. Try the trams...it will save you a lot of walking & tired feet. You can buy a strip of tickets at any Tobacco shop.

We booked the Amsterdam American for all but our last night. I enjoyed it very much. We arrived at 11am, several hours before checkin time, but we were checked in right away. The houseman gave us a little tourist guide and street map and helped with our bags. Everyone at the front desk was helpful and pleasant during our stay. I had read the rooms were tiny, but I found ours comfortable. All the furniture was in good shape and the bathroom was great. The bed was a true American king size and very comfy. The shower was lovely (though the shower curtain let too much water through and flooded the floor every day). The hair dryer was a little weak, but it worked. The shampoo, shower gel and soap were replenished every day, and were good quality. The room had coffee and tea making supplies, but we did not sample them. Signs asked us not to use the minibar fridge for our own items, which I found a little annoying. There were plenty of electrical sockets in the room for charging our electronics and such. And housekeeping made the room up nicely every day and were very respectful of the 'do not disturb' sign. Our view was to the back of another wing of the hotel, but the large windows opened fully and allowed plenty of light. Good quality drapes blocked all light at night, and double-glazing kept out drafts and street noise. The hotel is right on Leidseplein and at the corner of multiple tram stops, which made this an excellent location. We ate at restaurants on Leidseplein every night and took the trams to visit museums and other attractions. Very convenient. We stayed over a weekend and into the next week. The weekend nights are party central on Leidseplein, and the crowds of drunk, stoned, and silly young people did get tiresome. But that's certainly no fault of the hotel's! We did not eat at the hotel. Breakfast was priced too high, and the fine dining in the restaurant was out of our budget. On our last day we were changing hotels to stay near the airport for a very early flight. We checked out at 11am, but the American hotel cheerfully stored our bags for the entire day. When we came back for the bags in the evening, they called a cab for us to take us to the airport hotel.", "Date": "December 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perthshire", "Title": "\u201cstunning stay\u201d", "Author": "Flipautum", "ReviewID": "UR21899072", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights through on business.

I'd never experienced any problems with booking a room in this hotel before, so it came as a shock. As it was entirely the hotel's computer system fault for the confusion, they made up for it all by offereing me a suite instead of the usual standard single room I'd originally booked and I was also offered complimentary breakfast! (usually an extra 19.95Euros), so the confustion actually worked out for the best and I ended up having one of the best stays I've ever had in Amsterdam! The suites are on the hotel's 1st floor and are very comfortable and spacious. Toothbrushes, razors, slippers and all necessary toiletries are already there in the bathroom, so it's not even necessary to bring them packed, as the hotel provide them free of charge. The one main reason why I always choose to stay in The American while in Amsterdam is because I have a lot of fond memories of socialising in the famous Bar American, plus the cocktails here are delicious and at 9Euros each, that is not all that expensive compared to the ridiculous prices we are charged for good cocktails at trendy bars in London. The drinks were as tasty as always, however, I was very disappointed with the food menu this time, 14Euros for a Caesar salad was too much for what it was. The bar itself has undergone a few changes over the years, but still remains the popular rock 'n' roll style hangout it's known for. I go to see bands at the local Melkweg music venue, which is just across the road at the back of the hotel and the Paradiso, another popular live music venue and club is just a stroll away. The Leidseplein area is always buzzing and the trams stop just across the road from the hotel.

Cafe American is as expensive as ever but it is great to get a table by one of the huge windows and watch the world go by (day or night), Breakfast is adequate and dinner is always a grand occasion. Reservations now also refuse to entertain booking a specific room or even recording a preference of which side of the hotel you would like to stay. On my last visit in January I was overcharged by 600 euro and it took me 3 weeks to sort a refund. No apology was offered. The fire alarm also got triggered at 4am in the morning and could not be switched of for 1 hour despite the hotel staff telling the guests not to leave their rooms. What has been gained by the refurb seems to be lost in the service that really made the American an amazing place to stay. For the first time in over 10 years I have just booked an Amsterdam trip and I will not be staying at the American.", "Date": "March 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wigan", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel & great location\u201d", "Author": "RIPScarlett", "ReviewID": "UR13856237", "Content": "My partner and I have just come back from a weekend at the American Hotel and I thought it was a great hotel in a great location.

This hotel has two main features that I look for: Nice comfortable, clean room AND location, location, location. The room was definitely nice and clean. It had modern decor and furniture to the room. The bathroom was nice and clean. The bed was comfortable.... and so where the blankets and pillows - oh the pillows! =) The room was a tad bit narrow for my taste, but it was NOT closet tiny like most european hotels. Location was what this hotel is all about! It is located RIGHT smack in Leidseplein (if you are familiar with Amsterdam - it is literally one block from Bull Dog). I like the location because yes, it's in a touristy area, but it is in a safe area. Late a night, you can easily walk over to the next block where all of the restaurants and cafes are and people watch all night long. The long streets of shopping are also about a minute's walk away. When you walk about 5 minutes in the other direction, you can easily cross the Holland Casino and make your way to Museumplein. But of course, the tram stops are right near the hotel, so you can pretty much get yourself everywhere around town. The people who worked the reception were really nice and helpful. They were able to make reservations for us as needed for restaurants and taxis to the airport. This is my fifth year returning to Amsterdam, and this is amongst my top choices for hotels.

A subpar buffet breakfast costs 21 Euros (after making the mistake once I walked down the street to Bagels and Beans and ate much better for 4 Euros), basic internet access costs 17 Euros a day and I had problems with my eithernet connection.

I let the manager know 24 hrs in advance that I would be leaving 2 days early, however, apparently once you physically check in to the hotel you can't change your end date. You can change the length of the reservation after you make it but this has to be done bfore you check in. My company was obligated to pay for the two days that I didn't stay there -- and they could have easily re-rented the room as it was a national holiday and 3 day weekend. Additionally, two colleagues for work were coming out for a week for work and our work travel department booked them in the hotel as well (I have since told them not to put people there). Based on my review, my co-workers tried to cancel their reservations at the American Hotel 3 weeks in advance of their arrival date and they were told that if they cancelled they'd have to still pay the full amount for their stay (over 1600 Euros each). So, apparently you can't cancel a reservation in it's entirity as well. You can only alter it (which is what they did -- changed from 8 days to 1 day and will be moving to a nearby, nicer and cheaper hotel) . Apparently these details are included in the fine print when you make a reservation, but I have never heard of such an inflexible reservation policy and haven't found another hotel in Amsterdam that has such a policy in place.

This art deco monument on Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Leidsekade has a charming period exterior which was unfortunately obscured with billboards and scaffolding during my stay. Operated by Summit Hotels, a group that specializes in boutique properties, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location just off the busy Leidseplein will please you if you want quick access to the touristy sites and sounds of Amsterdam in the evening. It is easily accessible from the Amsterdam central railway station by taking the 1,2,or 5 trams which stop a half a block away so you can be in the thick of things very quickly. The rooms are clean and comfortable with high end bed linens and a plasma screen TV, and they are also air conditioned. I mention it because in northern Europe this should never be assumed\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6always ask when visiting in the summer months and make sure you ask re \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vs. the public areas. Even many high end properties will fudge on this. Most of the year it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not needed but it can make for a miserable stay in July, August or even September if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it. My rooms with a queen size bed was decorated in a muted art deco modern style that was very attractive and comfortable. A mini bar (with jiggle sensors) and an in-room safe is provided. I was somewhat amused by the safe in my room which was simply sitting unanchored in the closet. It could be moved all over (I did just for fun but put it back) and I could of easily carried it out in my suitcase if I wanted\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 See the picture. This may have been unique to my room I suppose. A buffet breakfast is available at 25 Euro\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. I passed on it and made for a neighborhood bakery..yum. In room Internet is offered but at nearly 30 US Dollars a day ,the local internet cafes (of which there are many) or the hot spot down the street at McDonalds is a better alternative and you will have it practically to yourself before 11 or so in the morning.. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shame really..hotels could really make a buck on Internet access and build customer loyalty if they would establish a reasonable price point. I suspect a lot don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know how easy it would be to maintain their own wireless networks instead of sharing profits with greedy telecoms. It might even pump Room Service sales in bad weather. Oh well..with more and more cities establishing public internet utilities at free or low cost it will become a moot point soon enough anyway. Although the Leidseplein itself is a bit tacky with lots of really awful street performers, there is plenty to do just outside, with theater, cinema, bars, nightclubs and hundreds of restaurants within easy walking distance.. OK to be honest, half the restaurants are Argentinean steak houses, (darned if I know why?) but there are still lots of choices. Tram access to most of Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractions or business districts is a snap so by all means don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother renting a car. Driving in Amsterdam will make you homicidal anyway. Walking along the nearby canals is a pleasant way to spend some time. Cycling around town is even an option with bike rental readily available. I paid about 220.00 US dollars a night to stay at the American and reckon it was a fairly good value when compared to its local competition. The rack rates are much much higher however so shop around. Staff was pleasant, attentive, and professional. All in all, I would say its four star rating is legit..

On that occasion I stayed at the very pleasant Amsterdam Art Hotel. The only problem was the distance from the hotel to the city centre (3km). This time, recalling that lunch, I found and booked to stay at the American Hotel at a very reasonable rate (approx 80% discounts available if you find the right sites). The staff were pleasant and helpful. Part of the Hotel was under renovation and when we arrived at our room, there was a letter on the bed apologising for any disturbances, and offering 1 pack of earplugs and 1 small paintbrush compliments of the Hotel! Thick walls prevented any unwelcome noises, the bedrooms were stylish and modern whilst remaining comfortable [excellent bed!] and the bathroom housed a shower/bath in which I had the best shower I've ever had at a hotel. The only disappointment was the cost of breakfast (22 euros per person). I'm not known as a tightwad, but we were able to get delicious hearty breakfasts that cost half that amount at a cafe across the square, and how can you argue with that? The Hotel's location can't be faulted as it is situated in the heart of the eating/drinking/shopping/theatre area (Leidesplein) and only a few minutes walk from the main art and histrory museums. Plus, pretty much all the main attractions are within 40 minutes walking distance. Alternatively, the Canal bus, regular buses and trams all have stops right outside the Hotel. The restaurant is worth a visit. The food is very good if a little pricey (lunch is best for those on a budget), but what makes it worthwhile is the amazing Art Nouveau interior.

The American was 5 Euro cheaper than the Marriott. It cost 160 Euro for 1 night (without breakfast). On first impressions, the hotel seems very nice. It has a cosy bar, and an inviting reception. The staff were pleasant and prompt. When I reached my room I was very disappointed. The room is narrow and you have to manoeuvre your way passed the TV cabinet to get into the room. When the bathroom door is open it is virtually impossible to get passed the bed. The bid is a King-size, but the mattress is extremely soft and I am struggling to sit on it, never mind sleep. The sheets are cheap, and the budget didn't even run to a valance on the bed, as I can see the bed base (which is quite unsightly). The furniture and curtains have definitely seen better days. The bathroom is tiny. Barely room to take a pee standing up! All of this is in stark contrast to the Marriott, which has recently been refurbished.

We are not picky customers but I think waiting approximately one hour to get our main course is a bit much. My real complaint is that no one, such as a floor manager, stopped by our table to explain what the problem was and offer us a drink. We were in no rush and would have been sympathetic. Having worked in a restaurant I know that chefs do melt down and kitchens do get overwhelmed. One waiter did mention that we were not his table and he was helping out another waiter and another waiter mentioned something about new systems. It was not just us. A poor family with kids at the next table also waited a very long time for dinner. The clincher was when I asked for the dessert menu. Yet another waiter brought us the menu. When he returned I ordered Creme brulee, one of only several desserts, and the one thing I was looking forward to all night. They were out! Why he did not mention that fact when he brought the menu escaped me. The food was good but all in all we were very disappointed. We expected the service would match the decor and it did not. I hope the management pays some attention to this issue and corrects it. Other folks had posted similar complaints and we decided to take a chance.

I happened to find a really great deal on the hotel on some site and was excited to go to this hotel. My boyfriend and I stayed there in early November after reading so many great reviews online and we were expecting a fabulous gothic and modern hotel. We were so wrong! I admit, the location is excellent: close to the museums, chic shopping, and the city center. Not in the middle of all the chaos but close enough. That's about where my compliments end. Let's start at the beginning. We arrived late in the evening and we were expecting to order room service. No room service after 11 pm or something ridiculous like that. When we asked the girl at the front desk if she knew of any restaurants that would be open, she said she didn't know any restaurants that would be open at that hour. After going back and forth with her she finally got the bell boy to tell us that McDonalds was open down the street. We walked out and it was raining. I went to the same girl and asked if they had any umbrellas for guests. There was a big box of umbrellas behind her. She said that they were out of umbrellas. I mentioned that there is a box behind her. She replied that they were for sale and I could buy one. I said I only wanted to use it to go down the street and as a paying guest, the hotel could afford to loan me one for 10 minutes. I can skip the rest and simply say, I got very VERY wet that evening. The room was really small. The furniture was in bad shape. Not modern at all. Somewhat dirty with strands of hair in the drawers and on the carpet. OK bathroom (clean and functioning). The people across from us were constantly ordering room service and the dirty trays were left all over the hallway all day long which was kind of gross. The final incident was the morning we were checking out. Our flight was at 4 pm and we requested a late check out. The woman at the desk said that it would be 25 Euros an hour which is something I've never been told at any hotel (even $10 youth hostels I've stayed at!) I would have preferred that she said the hotel was booked and unfortunately couldn't accomodate our late check out. Pretty tacky, if you ask me. It gets worse. We asked the front desk to confirm out seats and flight. The girl said that she couldn't do it. Why, you might ask? Her response was that it was really hard to get through to the airline and she didn't want to wait on the phone for a long time. Hello?!?! What kind of front desk person says that? If you weren't into customer service why would you get a job at a front desk of a hotel??? Needless to say, we spoke with the manager who was very helpful and took care of it. Of course, when we returned from walking around the town one last time, we asked the girl if everthing is ok for our flight. Her response was, \"Everything is confirmed.

After having booked two rooms in the new Rembrant Square hotel, building wasn't completed in time so we were \"upgraded\" to the Amsterdam American. Having seen the hotels website I was very excited and looking forward to staying there, and upon arrival was encouraged by the grand lobby and restaurant - however this was to change when we arrived at our rooms! Firstly, check in was a very long and drawn out process, and although the staff were quite pleasant, seemed to take forever. As well as this, the credit card details I gave at reception for security were later fraudulently used for purchases to the tune of \u00c2\u00a32500!! I have no guarantee that it was a member of hotel staff acting dishonestly, however it was the only time I had used this credit card in months. Once we left the lobby and got into the lift it was like we had stepped back in time! The marble floors had changed to 60's style carpet, and the spacious foyer was now a maze of dingy corridors! The hotel room itself served its purpose, but it was tiny. Especially the bathroom - it was virtually impossible to close the door while you were on the loo without taking your legs off! One of the evenings after a long days sightseeing (we had eaten on the way back to the hotel) we decided to have coffees and dessert in the hotel restaurant. We were served by a very eccentric man, who once he found out we only wanted desserts, looked at us as if we had horns and wasn't very friendly at all! We have stayed in Amsterdam before - and I was aware that their 5* hotels wouldn't be what I would class 5*, however I would say that this was more of a 2* hotel. Granted the location was OK, but the year before we had stayed at the Die Poort van Cleve hotel, just beside Dam Square, and were much more satisfied there. I thought the location was much better there too.

At no point during our two night stay did we eat in the hotel but we did have a few drinks in the bar, it was amazing to sit in the bar and look at all the celebrities who have visited the hotel.

The Bar is discreet and charming, the cocktails award-winning (ask for the margarita - it isn't on the menu list but it was no hassle for our barman!) but the crowning glory is the Cafe Americain. A huge vaulted-ceiling greets you as you step throught the doors...stain-glass and original art deco lamps...and a giant breakfast counter. From Chilled Champagne to fresh fish, Full english breakfast to European breads...it's all here! There is simply no finer way to start the day...

Wow, what a beautiful city! - Anyway when I returned back to the hotel, I was shown to my room, firstly, it smelt of smoke, secondly, view was awful. I asked reception if there was anything he could do. It was my girlfriends 30th b'day (hence the w/end trip) & I made sure reception knew this! He then gave me one of the nicest rooms in the hotel for no extra charge, with a beautiful view overlooking the canal!

Basically this hotel is very art deco, & some of the rooms are a bit groggy, but there are obviously some beautiful rooms too. I would recommend anyone to stay here, but as I always do - make sure you ask to change rooms! You never know whats available so long as your polite.

When we complained we were given another room that was equally appalling. The pillows, if they could be called pillows were flat, flatter than a pancake. Since it was hot and humid we lowered the thermostat. This did absolutely nothing. We feel that the temperature is probably controlled by the hotel. After a night of sweating on rough and worn out sheets we were more than glad to pay the hotel the 100 euro penalty that we had unforntunately agreed to when taking the room.

We booked direct with the hotel as they had the best rate and we chose a superior room. Check-in was fine and we got a drink voucher and some chocolates for being Priority club members! The room, however, was disappointing. We requested a canal view because we had read in other reviews that the square can be noisy. We didn't get either. What we got was a room with only two small windows which both opened onto a small gap between our bit of the hotel and the other bit. So we could look directly into other people's rooms and they could see us! Because the windows were quite small and the buidling next door being so close we didn't get much natural light so the room felt a bit dingy. For a superior room I thought it was a bit small and odd-shaped (we were right at the end of the corridor). The furnishings were nice and the bed was comfy, and everything was nice and clean though. The bathroom didn't have a window which I hoped it would as it was on an exterior wall. It was ok sized but definitely not superior. To be fair, we didn't complain and didn't asked to be moved as I knew we wouldn't be spending much time in the room so maybe we could have moved rooms. All this aside, the hotel is nice and very well-located. You can walk to all the attractions (some are 20 mins or so away but the walk is very pleasant as there's so much to see). The trams stop outside too so its very easy to get around. The breakfast was graet! I think it was about \u00c2\u00a38 but its a massive buffet and there's even Champagne included!
