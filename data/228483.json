The coach is not able to park outside the hotel because of it's narrow roads. So we are dropped along the main road and we had to drag our luggage for about 10-15mins uphill to where the hotel is. Perdestrian roads leading to the hotel were narrow as well. Luggage with wheels is definately an advantage here. The hotel is part of a chain hotels and it's quite a decent size, different from the family hotel we had been staying in. The lifts are small and wouldn't fit more than 2 people and 4 luggages so once again it's carrying the luggage up to the 4th floor. The room is a decent size, old decor but it's clean. The bed is a proper twin size bed and there's enough space to actually open our luggage up. There's a wooden rack/shelve which I assume it's for luggage but we just place ours on the floor. There's a long writing desk which is useful and the TV sits on it. There is also English channel which is great for following up on the latest world news. No Kettle or cups provided in the room. Plastic cups were provided in the bathroom.Internet provided in rooms which is always a plus. No mini fridge but there is a safe in the cupboard. However to use the safe, you need to pay 5Euro per day and a 50Euro deposit to the reception. We just lock all our valuables in the luggage. The flooring is wooden which also adds to the cleaniness. The bathroom isn't very and there's a bidet in it. Shower over bathroom and it's very tiny. Because the light is just where the entry is, the shower area is very dim, makes it very creepy when taking a shower. The window in the bathroom can be opened slightly but you get to hear the bathroom next door. In fact the room are so closed to one another you do not even need to open the windows.

But I was delighted to find an elevator which I had read there was none. My room was on the 4th floor and it was quite spacious with a A/C control. Also the window opened quite wide and although there wasn't much of a view it was nice to be able to open the window to the evening air. The hotel is situated in a quiet area so I was able to leave my room window open all night and the added bonus is that I never saw ONE insect in the five days I was in Barcelona... The room was spacious enough with two beds. The bathroom was completely in marble and had a heat lamp. The pressure of water on the shower was impressive. The beds were comfortable and the mattresses firm which I like :) Most surprising were the breakfasts. A full breakfast with everything imaginable on the buffet. I mostly went for the bacon and eggs, yogurt, fruit and bread... but there was so much more. Many people commmented on the delicious potato pie but I didn't get a chance to sample it. Also closeby is a lovely little pizzeria and for about 15 E you could get a delicious thin crust pizza and several glasses of wine. Would I stay here again? definitely.

I am not a fussy or choosy person, but first time in my life i had to change hotel before i could fall asleep at the first night. The room was smaller then a luggage compartment, although fairly clean (not spotless). Bathroom might have been cleaner as it is expected from a 4 star hotel. Still laughing at the 4 star granted to this hotel. When the hotel is full or have many guests then keep off this hotel. By the time i arrived the hotel seemed empty, and i got my room quickly, paid a lot for that. After going out, i went back to the hotel to sleep just realized my room was right above main entrance, with a huge sliding. The noise was unbearable. As there is nothing in the area, all the guests sat around the main entrance and the lobby, were very noisy. Literally, 2 metres from my window. As the sliding door open and closed, i could feel as my bed was vibrating, and unluckily, the door opened and closed in every 5-10 seconds. Otherwise, the corridor inside was quite busy and the door was far from the be sound proof. U could understand easily what the people were talking about even 10 metres from the door. This time was the volcano ash problem in the air, and i wasnt able to fly home. After a sleepless night waiting for confirmation about my flight, what was cancelled finally again, i found this hotel, where i met with these problems written above. So i tried to make changes at the reception, where the hardly english speaker receptionist refused to check how he can help me about to switch to another room, and refused to give me refund for the second night what i was about to spend in another hotel. The receptionist showed totally no respect to me as turned his back to me and didnt listen to my inquiry. Finally after 30 minutes arguing, i could get some money back, and i moved out. The guy was absolutely mean, rude. I hope he is gonna be fired as he is not suitable for that role where the politeness, helpfulness would be the first.

This hotel is located at Putxet 68-71 in Barcelona, Spain. I stayed here as part of a tour with company called Contiki in 2007. It was a decent hotel, had nice rooms and good elevators. It was walking distance to the local metro to which you could make it to many different places. From Lesseps you can get to The Ramblas (town centre, lots of tourists) in 10 minutes. The hotel is also close to the Parc Guell where you can see a lovely view of the whole city from a great height. The rooms were clean but abit small and I found left over bread and bread crumbs in my sheets. I'm not sure where that came from. The room overall seemed quite average for a 4 star hotel. The walls were also quite thin. You could hear our Contiki group talking and drinking in the hallway. The bathroom is quite stylish and modern, and you are given complimentary toiletries, including a toothbrush, shoe horn and shower cap. As well as a shower there is a bath tub, but for some reason the plug was too small for the hole so I couldn't run a bath as the water would immediately drain away. The staff were ok, not very good at speaking English, one lady in particular had an attitude as if she didn't want to be there. Although, I had to stay at another hotel the night before, as the actual price for one night was over 200 euros a night, So I say don't bother.

One of the major benefits and also the main reason to choose this hotel was the price - 6 nights in a 4-star hotel for 250 EUR is not something you come across often. So what do you get for such a small price? First of all, I was very fond of the location. Being away from La Rambla and the big tourist routes meant that it was quiet and at night you could sleep instead of burying your head under the pillow and moaning about the noise. It wasn't in the middle of nowhere either - Linea 3 (the line which can take you to all the touristy places) subway station is within a 10-minute walk, and subway is very convenient, cheap and reliable. I had no trouble getting to the hotel from the airport using public transportation as late as between 1 and 2 am. There are also small supermarkets with a very decent food selection en-route to Park Guell, which is probably about a 20-minute walk away. As for the rooms - my room was on the top floor, and it had a spacious balcony overlooking some rooftops and a green hill. In case you are lazy and can't be bothered to go to the beach, you can sunbathe on the balcony. The room itself was small, and while it was just fine for me since I was travelling alone, two people would not enjoy staying there. However, judging from the fire escape plan, my room was the smallest on the floor and perhaps they meant it to be for single use. It was clean and there were nice toiletries in the bathroom. The bath itself was also clean and had a nice modern shower. What I found lacking was the absence of a refrigerator and kettle and mugs. The staff don't speak very good English, and just like another reviewer here, I was faced with surprise from the receptionist at check-out when I tried to explain that the room has already been paid for via internet booking system. So do bring a paper where it shows you've paid - that should help. Having read some of the less positive reviews here, I was terrified of dirt and hordes of cockroaches, but must say that I have seen neither. All in all, I would say that it was very good value for money.

My directions: * From Lesseps head down RONDA DEL GENERAL MITRE (main road) * Stay on the right side of the road and turn right at CARRER D'HOMER * Walk up until you see CARRER D'OSONA on the left * A little walk further and on the slight left you'll see CARRER DEL PUTGET * You'll notice the hotel by the many flags hanging down from the wall From Lesseps you can get to The Ramblas (town centre, lots of tourists) in 10 minutes. The hotel is also close to the Parc Guell where you can see a lovely view of the whole city from a great height. The rooms were clean, however when I went to sleep in my newly changed bed for the second night, I found some kind of grit or crumbs under the sheet... I'm not sure where that came from. The room overall seemed quite average for a 4 star hotel. The walls were also quite thin; I could hear a lot of talking from the other rooms. The bathroom is quite stylish and modern, and you are given complimentary toiletries, including a toothbrush, shoe horn and shower cap. As well as a shower there is a bath tub, but for some reason the plug was too small for the hole so I couldn't run a bath as the water would immediately drain away. The staff are fine; not very good at speaking English, one lady in particular had an attitude as if she didn't want to be there. One gentleman tried to help me as much as he could and arranged me a taxi for my early flight home, however he became confused when I checked out and told him that I'd already paid for the room online with lastminute.com. I had to explain to him in a number of ways why I didn't owe the hotel any money. Although, I would say that the rooms were very good value for money, as when he did show me the bill (that I didn't need to pay) it only came to 75 euros for 2 nights (1 person). This hotel is not the worst one I have stayed at, but it's certainly not the best.

(It gets really cold) - the rooms smell like cigarette smoke and rot. - a 10-15 minute walk to the closest train or subway; and let alone finding a taxi because the hotel is in hilly residential area. - If you need cash, there is no ATM, and you are told to walk 10 minutes away to get an ATM. -If you need a drink you must go to the cold lobby and have change to buy from a soda machine. - In your hotel rooms, you constantly hear water running through draining and sewer pipes. and yes also 3 in the morning.", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cTerrible Experience\u201d", "Author": "MoshiachNow", "ReviewID": "UR10198830", "Content": "Room is cold and damp at night and no heat provided.
