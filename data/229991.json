I called to take advantage of the 21 day discount for early booking but they told me to go on line to book and they would work it out when I arrived. Now, mind you...I was quoted a price of $169 American not Euro. We arrived two days after my daughter & her husband. On arrival, I was surprised to see a fan in their room and it was HOT! It seems the hotel had not turned on the air yet and we were have 70 degree days. My room was on the 6th floor and it was hot also...the room was also \"set up\" with two twin beds pussed together when I had booked to full beds. I told them I had asked to two separate beds...I had no idea that it would be \"twin\" beds and I mean little twin beds. After my complaint about the heat and the bed...they came...they separated the two \"twin\" beds with new linens...and brought a rotating fan. I asked when the air would be on...and I was informed by two people at the desk...that it was a LAW that they could not turn on the air yet....I simply asked...show me the \"law\" and I will understand. I was promised a copy of the law...it never happened. All in all, the breakfast was good, staff ...there (dinning) kind and attentive. Maid was OK...but on return I was missing a new small shirt I purchased for my granddaughter...I searched every piece in my luggage and the bag of presents for the other family members...All the other presents were there and the wrapping which had been on the shirt was there but no shirt...I have contacted the hotel to ask them to \"look\" for the shirt. I made sure to check the closet and under the bed for missing articles...None found prior to leaving. I also took a coat hanger and used it to feel for anything in the top of the closet...So I am very disappointed in this hotel...Also,The hotel debited my American Express the day of the booking for the full price..and when I got my bill ...I was charged more for thr first three days(E153) and (E145) for the remaing four days because he said it was the last room and he could charge more. I explained that he had pulled the money for my room a month earlier!.. On top of that, I had to pay an additional 2 Euros per person per day. (E 4).

I had a single room which is narrow & long but ok for one person.You have to use the wardrobe for storage of luggage as the room is narrow & has limited room.I enjoyed all aspects of my stay... In late November I stayed one night & this time booked a city room which because it was off season was about the same price as the per night rate of the single room in October.. When I arrived at about 11am there were three people at reception complaining about noise issues with their room..this was resolved with them being moved to another room on the 6th floor but their luggage was being left in the current room until they came back later in the day...( I don`t usually eavesdrop on conversations but am mentioning it here as it is relevant to the issues I experienced)..As my room wasn`t ready they offered to store my luggage.. I left $3USD tip at the front desk as a tip for the bell boy as I assumed my luggage would be delivered once the room was ready..I also gave $5USD tip to the front desk as I had a pleasant stay in October... I went sightseeing to the Vatican which is close by & arrived back at the hotel at 3.15pm to check in..I was given the key for room 116 on the 1st floor & proceeded up to the room to find the maid in the process of cleaning it & then reacting somewhat hysterically when I arrived..there was luggage in the room that was not mine?? So a staffer apologised & said that my room would be ready shortly & offered me a free drink at the bar while I waited...not long after they told the barman that my room was ready & I proceeded up to the room..My luggage wasn`t there so I rang the front desk & the bell boy brought up the luggage..I told him that I had left a tip for him at the front desk & he said that he had not received any tip & I said that I had left one for him & his response was no!! no!!..his attitude was not very good at all..Soon I noticed grinding noises,hammering etc.. from the adjoining room & went out into the corridor to find that the room next door was being renovated as well as 2 or 3 other rooms adjacent & dust all over the floor in the corridor.. I was tired & had wanted to have a afternoon sleep which was impossible with all the various & at times very loud noises coming from the adjoining rooms...I rang the front desk who told me it would only be for about another 20mins (at about 4pm) & it continued so I rang asking could they please give me a idea of when the noise would cease & was told that the workmen would leave by 8pm..after the tradesmen left the bell boy was in there cleaning & vacumning & this went on until he finished at about 11pm...I rang the front desk twice again & they apologised but didn`t do anything about the noise..I had to be up early the next day for my flight out of Rome..when I checked out I told the guy that I was very disappointed with the noise & he apologised..When I booked the 2 stays in special request option I had requested \"Quiet Room Please\".Also as the people in the room before me were moved to another room why wasn`t I assigned to a room that I had booked originally??? rather then being placed in the room with the renovation noise problem???? I was really annoyed that all they could do was make excuses & not do anything about the excessive noise & inconvenience I experienced...this was very very disappointing & has made me consider whether I would stay at this hotel again considering this bad experience... Also in regards to the shower in room 116 the shower doors open from the front corner & the doors do not open fully so I found that I had to turn sideways & breath in to get in & out of the shower!!

The bathroom was huge though the useable space -no shelves-poor lighting made it difficult to use. There is a huge bathtub that is awkward and without jets so is somewhat pointless.

You walk down an alley enjoying the architecture, mixing the old and new together, turn the corner and there you are faced with a marvelous sight.

Finding there was no line, we walked over without reservations & got in right away & spent the rest of the day enjoying the sights.. Our room was fine, quiet, & large with a side view of the top of St Peter's. At breakfast, Beny ushered everyone in and was very personable & attentive to all the guests. We had a lot of fun trying out Italian- sounding words with him. Told him the breakfast selection was fabuloso. Turns out his English is far better than our Italian. The next morning, he even remembered how we took our coffee. The breakfast was hearty with bacon, ham, berry cheesecake, OJ & more...a true buffet to power you for a full day in Rome. Beny is bennisimo!! The Spring House met all our needs in fine fashion...even stored our luggage before & after our checkin & checkout.

Our room was dusty and had ants in it! I mentioned this to reception who sent someone to fix this. However, this was an ongoing issue during our stay. In addtion, the room was very dusty and not properly cleaned. Again, I had to raise this with reception. No air conditioning upon our arrival. I was told that this was due to regulation. No one told me! Breakfast was ok and the staff that serve it are very good. Next door is a shop where you can buy water very cheap. A large bottle of water costs 20 euro cents. Tne same bottle will cost approximately 1 euro 80 cents from the nearest station! We used the station \" Cipro De Vaticani\". You can buy tickets from the station or the tobacco shop around the corner. However, the owners were so unwelcoming, after a couple of days, we just went to the station - get the tickets from the machine. VERY IMPORTANT - the hotel's nearest stations are on Line A. This line shuts at 9pm every day except Saturday. After this, you have take a bus replacement. This can severely delay your journey back to the hotel. Whatever you do, don't get of at the stop \"SPAGNA\". One night, our train broke down there, at about 08:30. We had to walk for miles to find the nearest bus stop. We should have been back at the hotel by 9pm. We got back around 11:15. We had our 4 year old with us. Not good! The hotel is very near to the Vatican. The queues to get in were massively long. To avoid this, we saw the Vatican via a guided tour. This is more expensive. However, you do avoid the queues. Getting on a tour is no problem. This is big business and there are many many tour guides who want your money! It cost 45 euro per adult, but is saves you a potentially 5 - 6 hour wait! I found the locals to be not very helpful. Crossing the road is very dangerous! Foodwise - Rome is not cheap. Eat the breakfast and lots of it! Good tip - for a fantastic cheap ice cream, go the \"THE OLD BRIDGE\" ice cream shop near the vatican. Very good. If you like Indian food, you have to go to the Vittoria or Terminin areas - good food there. Buy travelcard to get around. This will let you go on any form of public transport. Otherwise, be prepared to walk! There are not many tube stations! The main sights are fantastic - Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Vatican - all incredible. Rome is not a place to take your young children.

We were pleasantly surprised to be on the top floor with a balcony over looking the walls of the Vatican city which was far from our expectations considering the trend of very small hotel rooms across the city. I appreciate that location needs differ for everyone so I will summarise the keys points which suited us. The hotel is 15 minutes from central termini station by tube (by far the best way to get around, safe and cheap, 4 EUR for the day). The area surrounding is quieter than the main tourist streets of Rome though there are several local restaurants that the locals use which is a very good sign of quality in my eyes. Hotel is on the north wall of the Vatican City which if you are visiting Rome is sure to be on your list of places to visit. As the queues to get in can be ridiculous it makes sense to head over as early as possible after breakfast to beat the rush which makes location ideal. The only con I would say was the hotel restaurant served average food but with so much choice in surrounding streets I don\u2019t think this is a big deal.

Due to the noise from the other rooms and air con, a small bed and a hot room I had a terrible nights sleep. To be fair the room and bathroom were clean and smart. I felt the 110 euro charge for this room was excessive. Breakfast offered a cold buffet which was OK but I had to keep asking for a hot drink which eventually came as I had finished breakfast and I was ready to leave. As a business traveller my priorities are the bedroom quality, sleep quality and breakfast.

Their English was impeccable, they were more than happy to share their knowledge of/recommendations for the city and one could really sense the care they imparted upon their guests and the quality of their stay. Our favorite was the manager Daniel who warmly greeted us upon our arrival and felt like a friend throughout our visit. When booking the reservation online we mentioned that the trip was a celebration of our impending parenthood. When we arrived in the room, there was lovely fruit basket and congratulatory note with a stork awaiting us on the desk. What a kind and memorable gesture, we still have the note and feel like that small act set the tone for our entire stay.

We picked the Best Western Spring House in Rome for a number of reasons - the location close to the Vatican was nice, they offered wheelchair accessibility (for my father), we wanted a US hotel whose reputation we could trust, and the price was right. When we got there, the hotel had a lot going for it - the staff was cordial, the rooms clean, and the beds firm. It wasn't luxury accommodations by any means, but when you are on a budget, clean counts for a lot. The place also had a touch of modern style and the little bar served good food for weary travelers. The elevator broke down while we were there, but they had someone working on it immediately. We've traveled enough to know that things like this happen in old cities though, and don't really count that against them. Our biggest disappointment with the hotel is the security of the lobby. When we arrived, we were tired and hungry but had to wait for our rooms. OK. The staff invited us to the bar for a complimentary drink. They said to leave our bags (many of them including wedding dresses) in the lobby. We weren't in the bar more than 5 minutes when my fiancee went back to the lobby to check on the bags. Much to her surprise, a bag was stolen. We later went to managers office to view it on the security camera and confirmed that two people worked together to steal the bag. The staff was very apologetic about the incident and promised that their insurance would take care of it, but nearly a year later and the issue is not resolved. Were it not for this lapse of security, I would recommend this hotel for people on a budget looking for simple clean accommodations. As it stands, we must caution everyone considering staying here. Yes, Rome, can be a big bad city, and tourist areas are rife with pick pockets and petty thieves. But one thing we absolutely expect of any hotel is that they stop the riff raff at their door.

The truth is all Roman hotels are overpriced, but I think that for the little extra for the Springhouse was worth it. The Driver picked us up at the airport (it was night) and it was a new Mercedes.

Getting from FCO airport to the hotel by train: When you exit Customs at FCO, just follow the train signs until you get to the train stop at the airport. The cost to get from FCO to Termini station (the main station in Rome) was 14 Euros per person. Just walk up to the ticket counter and ask for a ticket to Termini. The train from FCO to Termini is called the Leonardo Express. It takes about 30 minutes to get from FCO to Termini. When you arrive at Termini station, follow the \"M\" signs for the Metro until you get to the Metro station. When you get to the Metro station, you can buy your ticket at one of the self-service kiosk. There is an option to have instructions in English. You can buy a 76-minute ticket for only 1 Euro to get you to Cipro station on Line A (take the Metro going to Battistini). We bought a 3 day pass for 11 Euros. This was the 3rd option. It takes about 10 minutes to get from Termini to Cipro station. When arriving at Cipro station, take the exit that has the \"Musei Vaticani\" sign. After you walk up the stairs, take a right. Then take an immediate right (this will put you on Via Candia). Stay on Via Candia until you reach Via Mocenigo. Take a right on Via Mocenigo. You will see the hotel at this point. It takes about 5-7 minutes to walk from Cipro to the hotel. 2. The hotel itself The hotel staff is great and helpful. Every staff member took the time to answer all of our questions. Paolo was especially helpful in the evenings for us. The room was very clean and looked new. But it was very small. I was in room 113 (1st floor over looking the entrance) and my mother was in room 133 (3rd floor over looking the entrance). I called the Best Western reservations number in the beginning of March and got a rate of 108 Euros per night with the Long Stay Promotion for 3 nights and my mother got the European Seniors rate of 108 Euros per night as well. Both rooms are single rooms. My room had about 2 feet of walking room from the bed to the wall and my mother's room had about 3 feet of walking room. The entrance to the shower stall is about 2 feet and the shower itself is about 2.5 feet by 2.5 feet. It was very small but there was plenty of hot water. The hotel has a computer close to the lobby to get on the Internet. This was very important to me to check flights and not have to find an Internet Cafe. The breakfast from 7am to 10am is excellent. The scrambled eggs were great. I was not expecting scrambled eggs. Also, the waiter at breakfast was very helpful in providing us with directions to the Appian Way. I would definitely stay at this hotel again even though the room is small. I really didn't care that much since all that I do in the room is sleep and shower. The walls are thin so I used ear plugs every night and slept fine. 3. Proximity to the Vatican Museum (this is where the Sistine Chapel is) The hotel is extremely close to the Vatican Musuem. Walk out of the hotel and take a right. Walk to the wall and follow it til you reach the first set of steps. When you walk up the steps, you see the entrance to the Vatican Museum. It takes literally about 2-3 minutes from the hotel 4. Subway system The subway system is excellent. It is very easy to use and the subways come so often that you don't wait long at all for them. 5. Getting from the hotel back to FCO airport You can buy your train ticket from Termini to FCO at the booth at the Termini station. You don't need to have a ticket before hand. It normally leaves from track 25. It costs 14 Euros per person to get from Termini to FCO. We flew on Continental Airlines which leaves from T5. So once we exited the train at FCO, we walked downstairs and had to take a shuttle bus to T5. Once you get to T5 to check-in, you have to take another shuttle to your gate.

This hotel was perfect, as I wanted to be right away from the noise and bustle of Termini, whilst still being close to everything. The proximity of the hotel to the Vatican Musueums cannot be emphasised enough - it is 2 minutes away. This in itself is enough of a selling point. However, I did struggle to find the hotel when I arrived at Ottaviano Metro station, but this was partly my fault as I arrived later than planned and misread the map. There are about 3 different ways you can access the hotel from the Metro station, but once you have figured this out, it is about a ten minute walk (and that is if you walk really slowly), and in a straight line. Roman streets tend to be quite long, and intersect each other more than once, and this did make getting bearings tricky. My room was very clean and the bed was so comfortable. The shower was also good, and there was always hot water. There were complimentary toiletries, tea and coffee making facilities, as well as a desk, a safe and mirrored wardrobe with plenty of hangers. The decor was very modern - wooden floors - but the room was still cosy. The TV had BBC World and CNN as well as French and Spanish channels. The room did get a little hot at night, but the window could be opened which was good as in some hotels you can't open the windows! The breakfast buffet was fantastic and definitely worth the price. You could have a healthy breakfast or a not so healthy one, the choice was yours - muesli, cereal, loads of types of bread, toast, jam, bacon, sausages, scrambled eggs, croissants, tarts, yogurt, fruit, cold meat, cheese, juice.... absolutely brilliant. Breakfast is served from 7.30 till 10.00 which wasn't good if you were rushing off to the Galleria Borghese and had to be there for 8.30, but otherwise it was nice not to have to be up and eat by 9.00 if you didn't want to. The staff were all really nice, and all spoke English. You can leave your case if your flight is later in the day, which was helpful. The area around the hotel is fine, as a single woman I had absolutely no problems, even at eleven o'clock at night. Rome in general is fine for a lone woman, just exercise the usual caution you would at home and you'll be fine. There are loads of shops, bars, pizzerias and banks nearby, as well as a Burger King on the Via Candia if you are craving a taste of home. There is a very nice bakery on the Via Barletta called Dolce Maniera which is open 24 hours, and they do lovely slices of pizza. Thoroughly recommend if you get back from the centre late and you're starving! It is right by Ottaviano Metro station. I would recommend this hotel to everyone, although it is not the best choice if you want to be right on the doorstep of ancient Rome.

It was really lovely to come back everyday to a perfectly cleaned, quiet and nicely air-conditioned room after a hot, dusty day out in Rome. Toilet was a bit small...wi-fi worked well though on tv there's only 1 English movie channel and BBC. Located superbly near the Vatican entrance (up the stairs only one road away)and it was very convenient to take the metro or bus everywhere else (we got the 16euro 1 week pass which covers all public transport. Any 75min journey on the metro is 1euro if you buy individual tickets but we liked the convenience of the pass). Technically everywhere else you would want to visit is walkable from the hotel but it was too hot while we were there. Do try the Old Bridge gelato place (just opposite the Vatican walls) which is cheaper and better than many others we tried around Rome. Do not attempt to go to the Vatican museum on a monday morning. The other museums are closed so everyone is here! The queue wrapped all the way round the walls to St Peter's basilica. Just a few hours later at around 1pm, we walked right in with no queue at all. Every other day that we walked past, there was only a very short queue from about 11.30am. It is worthwhile going up to the dome of St Peter's (for 6.50euros) and nearby Castel St Angelo has a terrace with lovely views while you have a drink or snack.

The Spring House in Rome is one of the best quality Best Westerns I've seen. Although not centrally located, it is professionally/efficiently managed and superbly maintained. Hotel and room decor were top-notch --we only wish we had more time to enjoy our balcony. Location: Located on a quiet residential side street very convenient to the Vatican entrance. However, you will still need to walk around the Vatican walls to get to the entrance to St. Peter's Basilica. The hotel is also quite far from most other sights, though, so prepare to rely heavily on buses, metro, or taxis. As a residential neighborhood, the area does get quite deserted at night. Hotel: The hotel itself is quite modern, with a sleekly decorated lobby and attached bar. The one elevator -- though modern -- is small, slow, and mainly used during the day by Housekeeping, but the stairs are perfectly functional. The breakfast room downstairs is complimentary and has a fantastic spread of hot and cold offerings. Rooms: We found a great deal on Travelzoo which gave us a Superior room on the 4th floor with a small street-facing balcony. The decor is contemporary, though the room is on the small side. Bathroom is immaculate with surprisingly upscale toiletries. The Superior room also came with bathrobes and complimentary consumption of the mini-fridge. Service: Excellent. Not surprisingly, most staff members spoke fluent English, especially at reception and in the breakfast room. We left our luggage at the front desk with no problems. Check-in and check-out were both quick and efficient. Housekeeping does a great job. Our only suggestion would be to have the front desk knowledgeable about bus lines to key sights like the Forums, Pantheon, Colosseum, etc. Internet: Free wireless in-room as well as free use of a computer and printer in the lobby area. Value: With the Travelzoo deal, we paid 91 euros/night, which we thought was an excellent value for Rome, and one of the best values of our trip.", "Date": "September 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Sussex", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location\u201d", "Author": "jgm2", "ReviewID": "UR39263712", "Content": "The location is excellent.

Their response was always quick and polite. I booked and went on vacation.

Feeling a bit \"stingy\" perhaps - here I had booked rooms way in advanced, now I cancelled one booking just to do another (at better rate).

By the way - it's not all that easy to find the \"cancellation\" on their webpage ! Even if welcomed friendly, it was somewhat obvious that the hotel was well aware of this when I arrived (there's a fine line there...) However, the stay in itself was good. Nice and quiet location, nice people, esp the breakfast lady and the porter. Convienient grochery store next door. Great room - high floor and with balcony.

This obviously is no fault of the hotel and the neighbourhood felt otherwise safe. My travellers tip: don't stay in Rome around August 15 (when we did!)-- this is a big national holiday and everything (banks, shops, farmacies, even some restaurants) is closed. It seems many Romans leave Rome for the last 2 weeks in August and mostly only the tourists are left! This was a problem for us cashing our travellers cheques at a bank without paying the exhorbitant 9.25% commission of the currency shops.

We picked this hotel for its location, literally a three-minute walk to the Vatican Museums, and its generally excellent TripAdvisor reviews. The hotel is small, but everything about it is great. Our triple room was spotless, the bathroom was small but functional, the staff was extremely helpful and courteous (special thanks to Jessica), spoke English, changed dollars to Euros for us, and arranged to pick us up at the airport and drove us to the ship at the end of our stay, for a reasonable charge. The complimentary breakfast provided by the hotel was excellent, with a wide variety of items, including scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausage. (Friends we cruised with stayed at a Marriot in Rome and told us they paid 30 Euro each for breakfast).

Our room was large, updated and clean. The beds were firm and supportive. Our room had a safe, mini-bar and a small television. A small gripe about the room: whatever cleaning agent they use smells like an overpowering cologne (Drakkar Noir?) - and it smelled like they used tons of it in our room. It was overpowering but opening the window for about 20 minutes usually cleared the air. The hotel staff was friendly, helpful and spoke English well. As mentioned in other reviews breakfast was very, very good. Having delicious and abundant breakfast options included with your stay is a boon considering how weak the US dollar is right now. The breakfast room staff was very friendly and accommodating. Coffee is self-service, but if you want a cappuccino or expresso you need to ask. The location is great. You can walk to the Cipro metro stop, as well as the Vatican Museum, in 5-10 minutes. There is a grocery store next door where you can pick up snacks and beverages (and anything else you might need, really) for much cheaper than in the tourist shops. Also, there is a 'touristy' area full of restaurants nearby, near the Ottaviano metro stop. Walking back to Spring House from St. Peter's square you will pass a large square, where an electric train/tram runs. In that square there is a sandwich shop with delicious and reasonably priced sandwiches. (I will update this review with the restaurant name when I can.) This is a good option for lunch/dinner if you don't want to have a sit-down meal, or if you want to save some money. Further along the walk back you pass Old Bridge Gelateria - do yourself a HUGE favor and grab a cone here. Amazing stuff. Rome is a very expensive city to stay in, particularly for US citizens with the weak US dollar. This is a Best Western, which means it is a nice, clean hotel with the ammenities many US travelers expect. But, it is in Rome, which means it is expensive.

The hotel shows it self to be 3 star but I think they deserve an increase. I have stayed various 4 stars and I think the Spring House out shone them. We had a twin room which was quite spacious and had lots of room for us to move around without getting in one anothers way. The cleaner visits twice a day and each time left the room like new. The location is fantastic for access to the Vatican, being only minutes from the museums entrance and the metro station is just as close. There are also many italian restaurants local which all served fab food, and the bonus being they were full of locals not many tourists which made us feel we were getting the real Rome experience. The only downside was the bar food which we decided on one evening after getting back late from a trip to Florence. Although the prices were very cheap the food is all cooked from frozen and was not great but was ok for hungary stomachs ready for bed. The breakfast buffet was completely different. Lovely scrambled eggs etc and lots of fruit/pastries and other delights to choose from and to set you up for a day of walking around the sites. The other bonus of the Spring House is that it's situated next to a 'Spa' store which was handy to buy cheap mineral water etc and biscotti to take home.

The hotel is in good condition and the rooms are updated and clean. If driving, the hotel is readily accessible, if you have good directions. However, parking is limited, so make a (extra cost) parking reservation in advance. The short side street the hotel is on is a little towards the unkempt, but the main street has some great shopping and the Vatican Museum entrance is just around the corner. If driving, the street parking in front of the hotel is limited, so make arrangements in advance. The first night, we ended up parking our car on the street a couple of blocks away, but despite all the auto horror stories we heard about Rome, everything turned out fine. After that night, and a couple of extended conversations later, the front desk staff was able to arrange parking in a private access, underground garage next to the hotel. The front desk staff was able to check us in quickly and provide assistance getting our luggage to our room. Typically, the single elevator was a snug fit for three and luggage, and took a little while to get up or down at \u2018rush hours\u2019. The updated fifth floor room overlooked the street in front, and had a quaint urban view of Rome and the western wall of Vatican City. The room itself was small ,but modern. The bath was a bit snug by U.S. standards, but typical of Italian hotels and in very good condition. The shower provided plenty of hot water, but again, was of the typical size for Italy. When in Rome \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. The bed was a U.S. sized double, and comfortable. The room had a small balcony that provided some neat downtown/urban style views, and a good view of the wall of Vatican City near the museam entrance. The only drawback was the occasional conversation that drifted through the door to the connecting room as the American businessman staying there held conversations with co-workers back in the States. Otherwise the hotel was a fairly quiet place. The breakfast room is in the basement, and is well kept, clean, but a tad dreary with no windows. The food was a pleasant surprise and had a wide variety of meats, cheeses, pasties, fruit and American staples of eggs and bacon. Of course, there was also a good selection of coffees and juices. Location-wise, the hotel is very convenient to the Vatican; especially the Vatican Museum. The museum entrance is about a five minute walk around the corner. St. Peter\u2019s is about another 15 minute walk further along the wall of Vatican City, with Castle Sant Angelo only a few blocks further. The main street next to the hotel is the beginning a of shopping/restaurant district that extends east towards the river, and a few blocks north and south (Don\u2019t miss the night-time views from the walk along the river, and the top of Castle Sant Angelo). If visiting the other sights, such as the Spanish Steps, Pantheon and Coliseum, either prepare for a relatively long walk, or use public transportation The front desk staff spoke excellent english, and gave all appearances to be helpful. However, we learned to double-check any directions or recommendations they provided during our four day stay.

Breakfast is also very good- they have a variety of cereals, pastries, fruit, and a few hot selections. The hotel is a very short walk to the vatican museum. We were able to walk to most of the major sites (though some are quite a hike). There are also 2 metro subway stations within short walking distance if you don't like to walk that much. The first time we stayed here we had a superior room which was very large and spacious. The second time we had a standard room which was smaller, but not bad at all. They also offered free internet access for 4 days. I would recommend this hotel for anyone on vacation in Rome- singles, couples or families.", "Date": "October 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cRecommend the Spring House\u201d", "Author": "anon14London", "ReviewID": "UR10029457", "Content": "Spent 3 nights here when on a break with my parents.

The air conditioning was also a welcomed friend after spending a long day out in the heat.

Doing this activates the electrical system. The hotel staff was extremely friendly.

The location to the Vatican Museum is very close - no more than a 5 minute walk literally around the corner from the hotel. The metro stop (Cipro) is about a 10 minute stop from the hotel. The breakfast was alright - not the greatest. They offered eggs and breakfast meats but, they seemed alittle too greasy for me. Overall, this was a positive experience. The prices seemed alittle too much for such a small room but, at least the location is very close to the Vatican and St. Peter's Basilica.

The Best Western Spring House Hotel is very clean. We booked a Superior Room and it was not big enough to swing a cat in but it did have a balcony. The shower was tiny and our friends who came in with us (who had the same type of room) could not even fit in it! The minibar was free which consisted of soft drinks, water and sparkling wine and beer which was free. The rooms were extremely hot and you could not turn the heating off. We had to sleep with the balcony door open all night which was fine apart from the fact there is night club over the road and all the smokers have to come out for a puff so it is very noisy - with the door shut you cannot hear anything. There are apparently two types of superior rooms and the others on our floor were huge which we only discovered on the last night so be aware. You are given a choice of pillows which is great if you want feather / hypo allergenic etc. The breakfast was good, fresh, plentiful offering both hot and cold etc. The staff were helpful and nothing was too much trouble. However, although all past reviews said this was an ideal location. I think that we would rather have been more in the middle of things. The area around the Best Western is about 10-15 Mins walk to the Vatican but after 8pm it is quite dead. We did go back one day just after 5pm and the place comes to life with great shops - we thought better than the Via Del Corso / Condotti unless you of course want designer shops. Rome is still great after 27 years although it has changed. HOP on/Hop Off Buses a good Idea. Best Ice Cream ever - the Bridge facing the entrance of the Vatican Museum - the Italians were queuing for it which is always a good sign and now we know why - even the nuns indulge!!! The queues for the Vatican Museum are HUGE in the mornings but we walked past at about 2pm and walked straight in. The paintings are truly wonderful. The history is fantastic. We had a meal in the Piazza Navona which was OK and cost for four 270 euros and to be honest we had tasted a lot better. We found out that Valentinos has a great reputation for food and is reasonable for what it is and seems to come highly recommended - there is a dress code. The Trevi Fountain is good apart from the lookey lookey men trying to sell you half dead roses / toys and take your picture - a no does not seem to suffice which is a shame when really all you want to do is look at the beauty of the fountain.

Close to Rinasciemento you will find the church of San Luigi Dei Francesci where there are three Carravaggio paintings. Nearby is the church of San Agostino where I think there is one more Carravagio. Didn't have time for the second church unfortunately. The 40 or 62 buses were really useful also. This bus took us from near Via Dei Corrodori or Via Concializione (sorry about the vagueness) down as far a Gesu. We could walk from there to the Pantheon, Sant Ignazio di Loyola, Trevi Fountain. The Palazzo Doria Pamphlij (of Via Del Corso near Piazz Venezia) is around this area as well and is definitely worth a visit. The hotel is well located with regard to the Metro. We walked as far as Ottaviano San Pietro station (10 minutes) but there is another station even closer. We took the metro to the Colloseum one morning.

Location is a 5 minutes walk from the Vatican in a safe area and most important, in a quiet street close to the major boulevards. A subway station is about 5 minutes of walk from the hotel which was very convenient to travel further. A step walk from the old rome or Coliseum(take the subway!!!) but you can't be closer than this for the Vatican.

In room safes were very helpful for stashing our passports and laptop. One adventure was our \"attacking shower\"- actually it was just unusual and surpised w all the different angles that water could come at you from. The hotel provides an excellent full HOT breakfast; the hostess was gracious and attentive. Staff was helpful all-around. TIP: We took a taxi from the Rome train station to the hotel (priced a couple of drivers, found one for 15 euros), however the subway 'metro' trains would have cost about 2 euros and taken us about 2 blocks from the hotel. Walking Rome appears very safe. We discovered that the metro subways close early (after 10pm) so we walked from the Pantheon back about 2 or 3 miles back to Vatican city in the dark, thankfully with a map. We had no trouble and had a great walk. TIP: The restaurants around the Pantheon are great. Our best dinner in Italy was in a cafe cluster 1 block from the Pantheon. We recommend avoiding the Mexican restaurant acoss the street - we know, we kmow, who would go for Mexicanfood in Rome,but it was late and was the only place we found open near the Hotel.

The hotel is 2 blocks from the Vatican, appears to have just been remodeled, has air conditioning, a great buffet breakfast, courteous English-speaking staff.

It was easy to find from the AutoStrada (it's not walking distance from the train station) and there is metered parking on the street (1 euro per hour from 800-1900) and the hotel can make arrangements for other parking. Initially, we had a room where the AC was not working well. We talked to the reception desk and was switched to another room that was much cooler. We tried a restaurant recommended by the hotel (Cul de Sac) which was ok, but found a much better one near the Colesseum called Imperiali. The only drawback is a very small shower. It's a bit of a hike to other attractions such as Spanish Steps, Roman Forum, Palatine Hill, but the metro and bus are close by (just beware the metro closes at 2100) Overall a very pleasant stay, we would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "June 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in Rome\u201d", "Author": "eva10", "ReviewID": "UR5353919", "Content": "We stayed in Rome for 3 night on May 27-30, 2006 the Best western Spring house. The hotel room was small which is typical for European hotels, but the rooms were extremilly clean. They put fresh white linens everyday. The staff in the front desk was great and very helpful. Even though, I spoke Italian thay were very nice and explained everything in English so my husband could understand as well. The hotel is literally 1 block away from the Vatican musem. The Metro and the bus are a 5 minute walk. The area is very quiet, and there are some very nice mom and pop type of restaurant that are cheaper then Via Veneto, but serve great food. This hotel was a great location if Vatican is in your priority list, especially since the lines to get into the Vatican are very long, and they start ealy in the morning. One great thing was that the hotel made a great hot breakfast. They also had great cappuccino and espresso but remember to ask the waitress fron them since the machine is inside their kitchen. I would definitelly recomand staying here. I had never been in a best western hotel, since we are normally Marriot or Swiss hotel type of people, but as I found out later, in Europe Best Western is considered as a Nice Category Hotel Chain. Rome is so large and there is so much walking involved due to sightseeing that I considered staying here since the room was the place when we crashed to sleep afrer each exchausting days.
