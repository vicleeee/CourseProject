It was built in 1525, and became the private residence of Andrea Gritti. The hotel has been modernised and offers all the facilities and services that should ensure a pleasant stay. The hotel is a 5-star hotel, but should actually only have 3 stars, as the atmosphere and service lag significantly behind here. Inside, the hotel seems a bit worn out, and sometimes the service is non-existing. However, the hotel restaurant deserves 4 stars, and sitting outside in the evening eating your dinner right at the Grand Canal is about as romantic as it gets.

The first night in town we had a room in a diff. local...by the Rialto. Went over to have a cocktail at The Gritti. It was VERY ornate...almost uncomfortable. Check in desk was SOOO unassuming...the staff was very aloft. Not really sure why...as they only WORK there. We were seated on the outside terrace, right on the Grand Canal. It WAS a lovely view. Waiter was VERY condescending...almost rude. My husband put him back into realty. He is waiter at a hotel....DUHHHH. The patrons around us ranged from ladies with their children, couples...some nicley dressed...MOST others in their American shorts, white sneakers and socks, etc. Most, it was clear, had just stopped by to see the place and we're not staying here. Surely, not what we wanted. We ordered 2 drinks...nothing special. Tab was $52. 00US before tip. Just a TAD high...don't you think? The entire place had a very cold feel to it. So, we went to the desk and told them we would NOT be staying the following night for the 4 nights. They said they would be charging us one night as a no show. Fine...whatever. Well, the joke was on them. MONTHS later...we have never charged the one night. Sometimes, places, regardless of their cost or their \"class\", do not turn out to be what you anticipated. This was one of those times. My recommendation is to stop by and have a just a cocktail, even though VERY overpriced. We would never stay here. It is NO \"Palace\".

Located on the Grand Canal, we felt that we were in prime position to explore all of Venice while being quietly tucked away from the hoards of tourists. The outdoor restaurant/bar area was the perfect place to enjoy their delicious breakfast in the morning sun and equally a great place to soak up the stunning sights of the canal at night time with a glass of champagne. We were delighted at the little touches that the hotel went to, such as sending champagne and strawberries to the room, ensuring our honeymoon was special. The other exceptional quality of this hotel was the service level received from the staff. They couldn't have been more helpful when we asked for a recommendation for a cheaper 'locals' restaurant. The place recommended was simply excellent and located within a 5 minute walk to the hotel. The same fantastic level of service was received throughout our entire stay whether it be booking water taxis or help with directions. Having recently stayed in a suite at The Savoy Hotel,London which has been excellently restored to its former glory, comparatively (price wise) the Gritti didn't quite come up to scratch.

We choose the Gritti Palace, since we heard about this hotel from TV reportages and films. The hotel is facing a very strong reputation, and we wanted to check ourselves. My opinion is that this hotel is definitly one of the best - for all and everything : restaurant, situation, service, rooms, etc. Run by Starwood, the hotel is ideally situated at the heart of Venise, with an entry point on the Grand Canal, and another one by walk on the side --- no-one knows this passage, fortunately not the tourists, meaning that you don't have in the hotel tons of tourists just coming to 'visit' and 'see' the hotel (as opposed to the rival Danieli, where tourists can enter and visit the lobby, disturbing the hotel ambience). At walking distance, you find the famous Place Saint Marc, the Rialto bridge, and all the things that you usually want to visit when staying in Venise. Service at the hotel is great ; you can basically ask for anything and they will try (and generally succeed) to satisfy you ; as an example, the concierge service helps us managing our stay there, by booking things for us, and showing us the rights ways to go. The restaurant - which is on the Grand Canal - offers exceptionnal foods and beverages, but at very high costs ; you pay for the food, sure, but also for the situation, the reputation, the image, etc --- when dining at the candle light, you will face tourists taking pictures of you dining on the terrasse on the Grand Canal, as it is simply exceptionnal since no other place offers this possibility in Venise, not even the rival Danieli hotel. The room we took had a view on the Grand Canal, with a small balcony ; the room has a pure old-Italian look style, but for this place, you cannot expect something else, right ? The bathroom was OK, nothing more. Until the end of the night, you hear 'gondoles' singers from the Grand Canal, and this is just magic : being in your bed, or on the balcony, and hearing Venise at your feets is just smothing you need to experiencer at least one time in life. On the other side, my opinion is that the price is perhapstoo high compared to other 5-stars modern palaces ; I think that you pay for the situation, and the name.

I used SPG points to reserve four nights in a deluxe double room and was upgraded based on my Platinum status at check-in to a one bedroom suite (Room 325), which overlooked a quiet campo and church at the rear of the hotel. The room consisted of a large foyer, living room furnished with vintage and reproduction antiques and Murano glass wall sconces; a large walk-in closet provided plenty of storage, and the marble bath had double vanities with a large tub/shower, bidet, and towel warmer. The bedroom was also large, with a sitting area and antique writing desk. Windows offered a quite view of rooftops and balconies on adjoining residences. In addition to receiving a nice bottle of Valpollicello wine from the general manager, as a SPG Platinum guest, we were allowed to choose from a variety of additional amenities, so we chose a nice white wine selection as well. The first night there were local chocolates in the room, and at turn-down each night, we received Venetian gelatin candies. Internet was also free as a Platinum guest. The breakfast buffet is expensive at >50 Euros per person, but is fantastic, with hot and cold European style selections, an amazing array of pastries, and very nice prosecco. The breakfast dining room staff learn your preferences for coffee, tea, etc. on the first day, and no need to ask on future days. That's the level of service we encountered at every turn, from the front desk to the concierge. Cocktails on the Grand Canal each evening at Bar Longhi were a treat - the waiters are formal and unobtrusive (not aloof - you just need to signal when you're ready for your next drink - they will not intrude on conversations or quiet contemplation of the scenery going by on the canal). Lunch and dinner at Club del Doge were superb, again on the expensive side, but no more than a fine Manhattan restaurant, and a spectacular view across from the looming dome of the Salute. We took advantage of the Gritti's transfer service, which offered a personal airport greeting and water taxi transfer, which was again expensive, but worth every penny, especially after such a long flight. On check-out, we again used this service for transfer to our cruise ship. Our english-speaking escort was fantastic - due to crowding at the main water taxi landing, we were taken to a quite landing right at the bow of our ship, where cruise ship personnel directed us \"the back way\" to the check-in area. The Gritti is closing temporarily in November for an extensive renovation which, according to the front-of-house staff, will upgrade electronics (the old-style B&O TVs were once state of the art), safety, waterproofing, etc., but will preserve the fine character of the hotel with it's historic decor. Many of the staff were going to assignments at other properties in Italy or abroad in the interim. Despite other reviews to the contrary, no one seemed forlorn or withdrawn because of this.

Even Angelina Jolie frequented this place for breakfast. The rooms are very nice. The Venetian style room type, is ornate and stunning. But very dark, and lots of rugs, drapery to collect dust. We changed to a regular room after 2 nights in the Venetian style room. My only warning is, if you open your windows to get air or light, BEWARE, that pigeons will fly in. That is scary, when you don't expect it. Overall I recommend the Gritti. Perfect location , easy walk to everywhere. Clean, excellent. I highly recommend.

The Gritti is small, which made it quiet and relaxing, compared to the Westin Europa a short walk away. It has its own dock for the water taxi and a Gondola service next to the property, and if you want to use the Vaporetti to get around, it is less that 100yds away. The restaurant uses the veranda overlooking the Grande Canal in good weather. We really enjoyed the view. But, be aware that the Hotel and restaurant is pricey, and they charge an 8.50Euro coperta (cover charge) per person to occupy a table for lunch. For lunch we each had the ravioli and a glass of wine. The ravioli were the best that we have ever had, but then they should be at roughly $50 for 5. We thought that the coperta was excessive, since we were staying there. Like several of the other reviewers, I found the male concierge and other help somewaht snobbish.

There are many good charming restaurants to choose from within a short walk at 1/3 the price. You don't get a view of the canal, but you get good food. I got advice on how to get to the hotel, cruise terminal, and rail station from TripAdvisor before leaving. In Venice it is either by water or walk. We tried the Vaporetti to get to the hotel from St Lucia station. We had one large suitcase and a carryo-on bag and it did not work out well. The Vaporetti are crowded and used by tourists and locals to get around cheaply. I would not do it again with luggage, The same with Allilaguna to go from St Mark's to cruise terminal. If you can afford the 70euro fare, take the water taxi. It picks you up at the Gritti and drops you at a pier where you check your luggage.

First, it may not appeal to everyone. It has an old, upper crust, stuffy museum feel to it. I have been to this hotel several times, and have never seen more than three or four other patrons while there, as it is not a \"hot spot\" kind of place. If you are looking for a quiet, reserved, albeit expensive experience, then this is the place for you. I have experienced several different types of rooms, and they all have the same thing in common. Quite large SUITES, by European standards, with plush, luxurious touches throughout. (Thick robes, linen, damask curtains, chandeliers, rugs/flooring, beautiful antiques, ornate decorations). I did note that over the years, they have eliminated some of the hotels' signature features, opting for the Starwood Luxury Collection items instead, but this does not take away from the overall Hotel Gritti experience. Second, everything is top rate, including the service and the food, so be prepared to pay - it is Venice, you know! The rooms are lovely, the views are pleasant and the hotel is Old World Venice. It is not as opulent as the Danieli's Lobby, nor as modern as the Westin Europa, but in my opinion the nicest of the 3 Starwood hotels for the room experience. I have seen some rooms that did not have a separate area, but all that I experienced had hallways/entryways lined with closets (as part of the room) that led to the bedroom, with separate sleeping areas away from the bathroom, that helped with that larger feel. Yes, I did notice some areas needing touch-up, but I've also noticed that at every Venice hotel that I have stayed. I beginning to believe this more the charm of the Venice area, than a misfortune of the hotel. The hotel is extremely easy to get to, well located, right off the #1 line, before or after the San Marco exit - depending on the direction you are arriving, (with no bridges to cross - exit out of the walkway, turn right, walk down the square and you are there) or by water Taxi.

This is a very classy hotel that tends to deal with clients whom are of our grandparent's generation. I did not see any young guests or couples checking in and all of the patrons of the lobby bar, Bar Longhi, were 60+ and very classy. This is a hotel where even handbags are given a chair to sit on. I guess if you are willing to pay 1500\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for a handbag, it deserves it's own chair. The hotel does not have wifi in the room and still has a telegram/telecom desk which is a sign of tradition. The hotel is on the Grand Canal just like the Regina and Europa. The batman at this hotel wearing his classy white suit is somewhat of a prude or snob and this appears to be consistent when I described the person to Venetians whom know the property. If you are longing to go to Bar Longhi, I recommend you dress for it or you will get the \"snobbish lock of disapproval.\" The rooms are very tastefully decorated and large for Venice. You will find classic pink and yellow marble bathrooms with turn of the century cold and hot fixtures. All of the mirrors with the exception of the bathroom mirror are original and old and thicker at the bottom. The rooms are very quiet and you will not hear any heavy metal music or loud bands playing in your room. The tis still the old style with a tube and is quite small. I am not on the grand canal but along the side and if you hang out the window and look to the left, I too have a room with a view of the Grand canal. It appears that this can be done from any room that is not on the front of the hotel. The view from the lobby bar is quite nice and the same at the Westin Europa e Regina's Tiepolo Bar. I recommend skipping an experience with \"lo snob\" (the snob) and go to the Tiepolo Bar for a very genuine and warm welcome by Luanna and Aldo. Thereis no better Barista in Venice than them. Try a cappuccino shakerato. It is better than any Starbucks Frappuccino :) Service at the Gritti Palace is exceptional. the director, Paolo, runs the hotel like a ship and everything is done quickly and efficiently. The front desk is efficient and quick. The young hotel associate whom checked me in was vey friendly and open and friendly and shared with me his story of how much he loves to play drums and how this resulted in his carpal tunnel syndrome. Any request I had received immediate attention and Roberta helped me later that day to quickly resolve a problem. There is a gondola stand right outside the front door and the closest vapaoretto stop for the hotel is S Maria del Giglio and the hotel is down from the Bel Sito. Karen Brown writes about room 201 at the Bel Sito in her book on charming inns and rooms in italy. The gritti palace is one of 3 starwood properties in Venice. In ranked order, I prefer the Westin Europa e Regina to the Danieli to the Gritti Palace. The Westinhas the heavenly bed and now the heavenly bath with the double shower head. The Danieli has the impressive lobby and the rooms on the Grand Canal with balconies cannot be beat. The Gritti Palace has old world charm and caters to my grandmother's needs in a hotel. They are all beautiful five star properties. Also, the best kept secret is this: From the front door, you can take the cheapest gondola ride. You can take the traghetto from one side of the Grand Canal to the other for a very small fee. This could be the cheapest gondola ride you can take.", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "california", "Title": "\u201cElegance, comfort, view, luxury, location, perfect.......\u201d", "Author": "aloha25", "ReviewID": "UR73674178", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Gritti Palace on the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy.

We got a 700 room so we would have a shower, which ended up being in the tub. That was ok, but the water pressure was great if you like deep tissue massages. If you don't you were out of luck. It also either ran cold or scalding. It was hard to get anything in between. While the sink/tub features might be quality, they looked ugly and old fashion.

In fact.. after scouring TripAdvisor reviews, I switched my original reservation from the Hotel Danieli (very near ground zero of total tourist mayhem) to the fabled Gritti Palace, and I am very grateful to those reviews which lead me to do so. First.. I am not dissing the Danieli. The buildings are lovely (even the neo-fascist 40s addition closest to the Doges Palace, looks oddly appealing). The challenge with the Danieli is that upon exiting the hotel lobby [which is superb BTW] you are met by a sea of humanity rivaled only by Times Square in NYC on New Years Eve. Hurried, loud, oppressive and not the least bit elegant or relaxing. The other horror of the Danieli, is the very real prospect of ENORMOUS (20 stories high) cruise ships gliding in to your sight line from within the hotel. Yes, Venice IS a cruise stop... but somehow stepping out of the Doges Palace and confronting a huge, floating building, the size of Vermont is disconcerting, to say the least. This is, after all, not Ft. Lauderdale. The Gritti on the other hand is mercifully tucked away a few blocks from the madness of Carnival Mask Tourist Traps and the Luxury Globally Branded Boutiques of Calle Larga 22 Marzo. On its own, quiet and pleasant campo, the Gritti is perfectly positioned on the Grand Canal/diagonally across from the Santa Maria della Salute and the Guggenheim Collection. Drinks on the Gritti's Grand Canal terrace are worth the trip alone. With slightly over 90 rooms... this is a smallish hotel (by American standards), but one with First Rate concierge, house keeping and reception services. Despite some of what I've read here to the contrary, my experience with the staff was prompt, courteous, and extremely helpful. Roberta and Guiliano were particular stand-outs among the Gritti's front room staff. The ambiance of the hotel is hushed, intimate and quietly faded with an Old Guard attitude, which I found totally endearing in light of the 21st Century's Global Corporate Sameness, - but younger people might just find it \"old\". The public rooms are handsomely appointed with (mostly) period Italian furnishings and fixtures. It's clear that the interior design and schemes have changed little in the past 50-60 years, but its still \"current\", clean and impeccably run. If you are used to Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons \"up-to-the-moment luxury appointments and trend notes\" with \"statement\" floral displays at every corner you may be disappointed; clearly, the Gritti targets a more subdued, worldly & genteel circle. As for the rooms... I was lucky enough to stay in two rooms, as I left and returned to Venice during my most recent trip. The first room was on the 4th floor. Very large with high, beamed ceilings, double built-in wall armoires and a nicely built-in desk unit + an enormous bed and beautifully upholstered headboard integrated into the boiserie walls. The room was accented by smoked mirror walls and handsome (albeit overly gilded) reproduction \"Venetian\" side chairs, table and bench, most likely from the 60s or 70s. Handsomely carpeted and a large window (with no view) - but beautifully draped and finished. The bathroom was quite large and \"L\" shaped with two separate \"rooms\" each with wall-mounted sinks and a sliding glass door dividing the two spaces. This bathroom was smothered in highly figured grey marble from floor to ceiling and obviously not really updated since the late 50s. BUT... so well designed and maintained, that it was wonderful. The second room was #215, fronting on the Grand Canal with a small balcony. Smaller than the earlier room on the 4th floor, this room was very pleasing, with its 16 foot ceiling and balcony with grand views.. but despite its premium canal location, this room was less spacious and cozy feeling; and the bathroom, though more \"current\" than the huge one on the 4th floor, was small, less functional and somewhat tired, by comparison. I was told by the reception upon leaving that #216 is a gem (and larger than the adjacent room in which I stayed). Housekeeping was exemplary and responsive. And despite now being owned and run by Starwoods, the Gritti seems to have maintained its independent tone and almost early/post-war sense of style and service. Though ZAGAT rates the Cipriani as the #1 hotel in the Venice (with the Gritti as #2), the Gritti's location is much more ideal, especially for easy walking access to the main island and sights. There are no quality hotels and restaurants in Venice that are inexpensive - so I would give earnest thumbs up to the Gritti. Drinks and meals are costly there, as are the rooms - but the quality of room amenities, services and the hotel's superior, almost private location in midst of unbridled chaos, are worth the extra expense!", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "DC, Beirut", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel in a Great Location\u201d", "Author": "baci2003", "ReviewID": "UR68146697", "Content": "The Gritti Palace is located right on the Grand Canal. So the location is great. I think the location is the best part of the hotel. If you get a room overlooking the Grand Canal I am sure it is fantastic. Staying at a hotel right on the canal is very important in Venice. If you do not stay directly on the canal you will be dropped off by the Water Taxi and you will need to walk up and down the bridges and streets with your suitcases in tow which would really be bad. Please bear in mind this hotel is rated by Starwood as a Category 6 Luxury Hotel. I do not believe it is accurate. The hotel seems at least 20 years out of date. The last renovation must have been in the early 90s so the rooms feel dated and by no means Luxurious. The bathrooms definitely need a renovation. The shower head was clogged and only a few of the spouts allowed water to come out. The TV was a 19 inch unit that strained our eyes. The bed and towels were not bad. Simple things that you expect in a Luxury Hotel like providing a daily bottle of water are not done. It is these simple things that make the hotel not feel like a Luxury Collection hotel. The Concierges are pretty good but you get the feel they are in cahoots with the Water Taxi drivers. For example, when we took a Water Taxi to Murano as the boat arrived someone from one of the Glass Factories was waiting for us. He led us directly into the factory and proceeded to show us all sorts of Glass we could buy. We felt completely ambushed!!! The Lobby Bar Terrace on the Grand Canal is a great place for a drink.

We had a very spacious bathroom with a power shower that had several settings and could almost blow you away! Every detail had been thought of. We had complimentary handmade chocolates left for us and the hotel took it upon themselves to leave us a complimentary bottle of bubbly in the room for my friend's birthday which was a lovely touch.

Of course the property is old. I get it. But with these prices I expected a kind of run down chic. At this was not chic at all. It was not \"charming\" old in any way shape or form. We were given an upgraded room as I am a Platinum Starwood Guest. It was on the top floor at the corner of the building thus giving us 2 windows on to the grand canal. Location was great. But the room was pretty run down in all. I must admit I was surprised to see the very small shower coupled with a cheap plastic shower curtain in the tub. This was in addition to a funny bright yellow \"sponge\" painted wall color. Kind of strange. The bed was comfortable. The hotel provided a nice fruit basket. Beyond that it was quite a let down.

On arrival, though, the receptionist said she was going to send the housekeeper upstairs to check that everything was OK with our room. So we went onto the terrace to have our first drink of our holiday (I had a delicious Longhi fruit juice cocktail). But half an hour later our room was not ready, although it was past 3 pm and check-in time was 2 pm. They said we should wait for another 25 min. and apologized profusely by saying that they were fully booked and the staff were not coping! Not a good enough excuse for a five-star hotel. However, they did seem to be genuinely mortified. They asked if we wanted to have a drink on the house, but we had already had one (by the way, they made us pay for it in the end, now that I remember!!!) and it was late, so we went out to have a bite (some fabulous cicchettis at Osteria Dai Zemei, in the San Polo quarter), but we couldn't get changed and my husband suffered from a terrible foot-ache as he wasn't wearing his walking shoes. On our way back, in late afternoon, we were finally shown to our room. We had booked a Gran Deluxe room, but I think that what we got was a Venetian-style room - same price but much smaller. I realized later, but in the end I forgot to ask and in any case the hotel was fully booked, so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they would have been able to change our room anyway. The room was on the fourth floor, but with no view over Santa Maria del Giglio or anywhere else for that matter - just overlooking the wall and roof of what I think was another part of the hotel. Hardly any sky visible. The bathroom was OK, in need of some sympathetic modernization but quite good overall (and the bathtub was spacious, which we liked!) In the bedroom one of the side lamps wasn't working, but there was enough light, so we didn't mind - the receptionist who accompanied us to our room pointed that out, but nothing was done about it. However, I must say that the furniture was lovely, with antiques and hand-painted wood in pale green and pink hues that created a typical 18th-century Venetian atmosphere, so maybe that was more romantic than another room would have been and partly made up for the smallish size of the room. It was well-kept too. For those who like an elegant and traditional style, like us, this is perfect. But do not go if you are looking for a Marriott-style place. Also, the first night we had no turn-down service as the housekeeper came early, while we were getting ready for dinner, so we told her we'd be gone by 8.30, but she never came back. In spite of having specified in the booking that it was our first anniversary, nothing was done for us, not even a flower or a chocolate in our room, unlike what always happens in certain other hotels. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting an upgrade or anything so drastic, but a little touch would have been appreciated. And yet... apart from these blips, our overall experience was very good, so much so that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ready to go back! And we don't say this very easily. Breakfast on the terrace was fantastic, both in terms of view-atmosphere and of food and drinks. Service was also attentive. Internet service was given free of charge to arrange our online flight check-in. And we absolutely loved the hotel style and d\u00c3\u00a9cor! Location was also strategic, central but quiet.

The cons: no deal breakers but here is what I would improve: bathrooms need to be updated - not bad, just dated; breakfast was not up to par with other 5 star hotels (fine but not at a 5 star level).

The hotel is a short stroll to all the fantastic designer shops and St Mark's square, but still feels quiet and out of the way.

I planned this trip in great part using the opinions presented on this website, and I will tell you they are pretty accurate. We visited Rome, Florence and Venice and we stayed at Starwood properties in each city as we were using Star points. The hotel choices in each city were our biggest concern and the decisions were pretty clear cut in Rome (The St. Regis Grand was EXCELLENT!) and in Florence (the Westin Excelsior was beyond EXCELLENT!). However, in Venice the reviews of the 4 major Starwood properties were all over the board from great to down right horrendous! It was not an easy decision by any means and in fact I canceled and changed the reservation two times before leaving the states! Most of the major tour books on Italy mention the Gritti Palace as one of the best places to stay in the city, but the Tripadvisor reviews were pretty dismal at times so after initially booking the Gritti I bailed and booked into the Westin Europa and Regina. Then, as our trip grew nearer I started to panic and think I may have this once in a lifetime opportunity to stay at this legendary hotel on points that all these books are raving about, and I am going to blow it because of a few poor reviews! So, I canceled the Westin and booked back into the Gritti. Well, WHAT A MISTAKE! I cannot express to you the disappointment in this hotel. It is the highest of all point levels in the Starwood system and it is totally over rated and misrepresented! I have no complaints with the staff, they were not as warm as either of the Westin properties, but they were courteous and attentive none the less. It is 100% the rooms I have a complaint with. The room we were given actually was an upgrade as it had a pretty nice view of the canal through the window, but that was the only redeeming quality of the room. It was cold in it's decor, not warm and inviting as other European hotels we have had the pleasure of staying. The television was sitting on top of the mini-bar/fridge--it just looked tacky. The single piece of upholstered furniture was a tattered and stained wing back chair that looked like it was from my grandmother's attic! There was a lovely Murano chandelier, the bathroom was marble, and the room was generally clean.--but a few niceties amidst mostly sub par decor and amenities do not constitute a luxury room. The point of my complaint is this--it is not a tier 7 hotel!!! It is not a five star hotel!!! Who regulates these systems? Perhaps the Gritti Palace has some lovely suites for over $1,000 a night that the average traveler will never see, but I am here to tell you there are much lovelier rooms to be had in Venice for far fewer points and for a lot less cash. Even the common areas we saw at the Gritti were in my opinion dark and confining, not necessarily luxurious and inviting. I realize I am rambling at this point so I will close with this--we asked to be moved to another Starwood property within a few hours of checking into the Gritti and they kindly and efficiently accommodated us. We were able to get a room using fewer points at the Westin Europa and Regina on the SPG floor. There was no view at all from the room, but it was well worth the sacrifice because the room was plush, lovely and comfortable! There is absolutely no comparison room to room between these two properties! I want everyone to understand however, the personnel at both properties were accommodating and gracious to us and I have only glowing things to report about Starwood in general. The final thought I want to impress upon those studying this site for a future trip--I suggest you choose the advice of your fellow traveler over the printed guide books you may read because it has been my experience first hand that the people who invest the time on this site have experienced the \"real deal\" at the places they visit and report just that, as opposed to perhaps a sugar coated experience a professional author or book contributor may get when they experience that same place.

Our first inkling that this old place had seriously slipped was not being met by anyone to help haul our bags up from the water taxi stop at the hotel's entrance. It wasn't just a moment's inattention - no one is stationed on the water side to help guests arriving or leaving with their bags. Upon being shown to our room, we immediately became aware that the air conditioning was barely functioning; the bed was comfortable but neither of us slept particularly well during our stay of several nights due to the warmth of the room. The most perplexing - and aggravating - problem, however, was the small, sadly outdated bathroom. Sheathed in marble, it sat two large steps up from the room behind an odd door cut from the wall, and contained a skinny plastic-lined tub with one hand-held shower head, a toilet and bidet squeezed alongside two sides of the tub, a small sink and a very small table/stand. Over the years the marble in the bathroom has absorbed cigarette smoke, so the odor of stale smoke is the first thing we noticed each time we opened the door. I handwashed a silk teeshirt and hung it to dry overnight in the bathroom which was a mistake; the teeshirt smelled of stale smoke the next day.

We booked a \"grand luxe\" room through our travel agent who found us a deal at 435 EUR per night including buffet breakfast. We consider this to have been excellent value .Our room had large double windows overlooking the quiet square with a partial water view. It was a typical Venetian- decorated room- flounces,painted furniture,gilding, Murano glass with panelling and moulding covering every wall and the ceiling too. It had every modern amenity that we needed in a riotously decorated setting- the room could have only been in a palazzo in Venice. The bed was extraordinarily comfortable too. Housekeeping was of a good standard and invisible throughout our stay. We cannot understand some of the comments about the hotel's public rooms- it is full of antiques and parts date back to the 15th century. An antique mirror which needs re-silvering can hardly be described as \"tired\" ( or maybe the complainer was referring to old marble floors ?) We were not at all surprised to discover that an English duke was staying at the Gritti when we were- he owns a very well known palace himself . Maybe your correspondents would find that \"tired\" too. We found the staff from bellhops to barman to concierges extremely warm and helpful . We ate one meal in the restaurant which was good if a little lacking in ambience. We drank in the bar where the barman mixes a mean grog.

When a museum would not honour our pass for getting straight to the head of the queue and we mildly mentioned it on our return the duty manager himself came to apologise and telephoned the museum to remonstrate. All in all a wonderful and memorable break with nothing to complain about.", "Date": "December 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWhy complain about the cost?\u201d", "Author": "buccsmf1", "ReviewID": "UR6453702", "Content": "I have no idea why people go to a 5 star hotel in one of the more expensive cities in Italy and complain that they have to pay $100 per plate at their nicest restaurant or $30 for a hamburger on their restaurant on the water.....

I think the reason for the great divergence of opinion in these reviews is that the rooms in the ancient section (facing the canal) are grandiose though somewhat shabby, while those in the \"new\" section are furnished like a Super-8 Motel and face a stinking canal and the wall of a neighboring building. My room there was none too immaculate, as well. Also, the concierge was condescending and indifferent.

Sometimes I think of it as a bed and breakfast where the guest list just happens to include heads of state.
