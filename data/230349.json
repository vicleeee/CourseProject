{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Rooms - Very Close to Streetcar - Outside of Frankfurt The hotel rooms were very large and the beds super comfortable! The breakfast was the best European breakfast I've ever had as far as variety and quality.Although the hotel is located outside of Frankfurt - it is literally across the street from a trolly stop which will take you directly to the main train station - way more convienient than the directions posted on the website.The down-side. We stayed in three different rooms for two nights. The first night, Saturday, my sister was kept up by a loud party directly underneath her room. She called the desk at least fur times between midnight and four am and they failed to handle the noise - no sleep for my sister. The next day at about 11am we were celebrating my Neice's birthday and the kids (3 of them) got a bit noisy when they were throwing streamers and chasing each other around. Security showed up and asked us to be quiet. We thought this was quite ironic.", "Date": "Dec 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR661791685", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mandlintx"}, {"Content": "Quite average Very convenient for the Industrial Park.The room was very clean  comfortable, fruit was a nice extra.Wasn't impressed with the standard of the breakfast especially at that price.

Ok, maybe I did not look good enough, but when I booked this hotel I thought it would be close to the Congress Center (Messe), but this isn't the case! The hotel is outside the city center, but can be reached easily by streetcars. Takes about 20-25 minutes. The rooms are large and convenient. Breakfast is absolutely good!

The hotel was clean, comfortable, up-to-date, with friendly multi-lingual staff and well-appointed rooms. The food at the restaurant/bar was particularly tasty - which is a plus since there aren't a lot of other options in the area. A couple of cautions: 1)If you're looking for a cool location in Frankfurt, this isn't it. We had trouble even finding the place with the directions posted on the site. It's off in the suburbs - and it's a bit sketchy after dark. 2) The hotel is very noisy. Inside your room you can hear a horrible groaning (of the elevators, I think?), loud enough to interfere with my sleep even with earplugs. It quiets down in the wee hours, but starts up again around 5 a.m. This racket was bad enough for me to consider to switching hotels after the first night. It was like the place was possessed...However, the hotel is popular with flight attendants and pilots, so it must be a favorite in terms of price and convenience.", "Date": "Feb 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR860861376", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "follette1976"}, {"Content": "in total okay We have also won an ebay auction. 2 nights in a double incl. breakfast, 2 days transport, one Hessisch platter for dinner and a welcome present for 40 Euros in total ;-) The first room we got was noisy caused by the elevator therefore we asked for a change. The second room was very spacious, well equipped (TV, radio, CD player, some magazines, small refrigator, desk). Breakfast was great ! The spa is a sauna, steam bath, some fitness equipments, chairs, which is okay. Sometimes the staff is a little unfriendly.
