They don't have fixing service after mid day. Our first room had an a/c problem. Only air came out (like a ventilator) They continued saying It does work , sent someone, next day said it had been fixed \u2013 but no change. Only a third person admitted on the second day of our stay and we were given another room.

Arriving at the hotel around 11AM, my room was not ready yet and would not be ready for a few hours -- this was not surprising, but I was hoping to be able to get settled and cleaned up a little. Also, the female receptionist was rather cold and tried very hard to have me go to one of their other hotels in Barcelona as they had an over-booked night that day (due to a flight cancellation). I checked my bags at the front desk and headed out. When I came back later it took them a few minutes to locate my two bags. They gave me my keys and I found my way to the elevator and my room. The room was big (two beds for one person!) and had a nice view of the city, but the floor seemed a bit dirty. The bathroom was nice, but the bathtub had a broken plug -- it could not be unplugged and room service apparently broke the plug the next morning so it could drain at all... Also, the shower curtain was so thin (and of the wrong material maybe?) that water leaked right through it, despite my efforts to prevent this, and creating a huge puddle on the bathroom tile every time I showered. The shower I liked least. No refrigerator. The wake up call service worked too. There was wireless internet in the room, but it was pretty bad -- it kept dropping my connection all the time. I went to the top floor and saw a beautiful view of the city. Great view. However, the pool up there was tiny and I never tried it. The breakfast buffet was very good, but I'm not sure it is worth the money. The breakfast buffet was probably my favorite part, that and the top floor view. The hotel is not in a center location of the city, but it's very close to the metro/subway routes so you can get just about anywhere pretty quickly.

I had a terrible experience there: 1/ the room are very unequal - some of them were refurbished in 2004 and certainly don't match the 4 star standards, but most of them are really old and suffer from all sort of problems: -bathroom badly isolated, could feel the fresh air from outside which was very unpleasant in the early morning) -windows are single layered on the back side of the hotel, meaning you can enjoy the nightlife of Barcelona even when you are in your bed. I was there during Mobile World Congress, hence the hotel was fully booked and I could not get any better room. 2/ during my stay, there was some problem with dirty water from the distribution network and the staff had to let all the water taps open for 10 min in all rooms during the day. Unfortunately, the taps were left open for the whole day in the room straight up mine, leading to a massive water leakage which totally destroyed the ceiling of my room. You can see the pictures. My clothes were totally under water as well as my cell phone which I had unintentionally left in my room during that day. No need to say the cell phone was dead ! And some of my clothes did not like the water either. No problem, they said, the insurance will cover that. I took that for granted, but I was wrong (read further). The only positive consequence of this incident was that I got another room that night, but unfortunately the hotel management made absolutely no gesture at all to compensate the inconveniences caused by this leakage. They did not even apologize for that. I said fine, as long as the insurance repairs for the damaged items. The hotel manager signed a list of these items and said it would be fine. 3/ I have sent an email to the hotel this week to inquire about the status of the insurance case. To my big surprise, this is the email I got back: \"Dear Sir, Our Insurance Company needs to check the damaged objects in place, and actually in this case no reimbursement will be done for these reasons. Our Hotel in your next visit will have a special attention with you and we hope we can offer a solution even if, as our insurance company inform, They doesn\u2019t accept to process any compensation, we will do our best to give you another alternatives.\" So they basically lied to me when they said that all damages would be covered. No need to say that I will never go back to this hotel so I won't accept any other type of compensation such as a free night there... With a recent 6000 series Nokia cell phone dead, damages caused to expensive clothes, poor room experience, and such a un-pleasant relationship with the hotel management, I have nothing else to say that what is written in my title: AVOID CATALONIA ATENAS HOTEL BY ALL MEANS.
