Just steep bridges (if any!) and no easy taxi access to many hotels. But this hotel is closest to the main train station (Santa Lucia). You will be happy for the short distance (100 m) when you arrive or have to leave. In front of the hotel is one of the few bridges over Canale Grande (Ponte degli Scalzi) and stations for the Vaporetta (water taxis) are close. All the Venice attractions are with this taxis in a range of 20 minutes. The hotel itself is a classic Venetian hotel: The reception with an old glass chandelier, the floor corridors narrow and arranged around the stairways. The single(!) elevator for 3 people is slow but working. We had a Classic room. It is refurbished recently with a kingsize bed and the bath room is really nice with lot of white marble. If you are lucky and the room doesn't face the main street, you will have a good sleep. The main street is very loud, because the many tourists carry their wheel luggage to the train station early in the morning. Breakfast is okay in quality and quantity. But nothing special to remark.

Knowing Venice is a tourist trap, making hotel nights expensive, I'm beginning to see a pattern though in the Italian hotel classification. Meaning you should take away one star when comparing hotels with many other European countries. Hotel Bellini has a great location a bit away from the crowded centre with the railway station next door and all the major Vaporetta lines in front of the entrance. Bellini faces the Scalzi bridge, which is one of the few bridges over Canal Grande. You can use the Vaporetta to go to all major attractions, but a walk is nearly as easy; in around 20 min you reach St Marco. If you travel with luggage and you're new to the city, you'll be grateful to skip complicated routes to a hotel in a small alley. Remember: Venice is a labyrinth and is not easily navigated even with a good map, especially when carrying a travel kit... Bellini consists of several buildings, the major one being a typical older venetian house. Moderately renovated and refurbished it is a bit worn. Our room (standard room in the main building) was very small, not more than around 12 sq m (40 sq foot). The superior rooms would be larger. The beds are OK. The AC/heating was not in operation. A few rooms faces the very busy street and should probably be avoided. Our room, facing a side street, was quiet. Amenities average, mini bar expensive. WiFi available in the lobby, but not in the rooms. Nice and affordable bar in the lobby. One, rather slow, elevator serving the main building. Breakfast without any extras, but OK (scrambled eggs, bacon and salami very good!). There are (too) many flaws in standard and service to make this hotel reach four genuine stars. Considering it bears the name of the often rather luxurious Boscolo chain you are in for a disappointment. But if you ignore the Boscolo mark and accept it as a fairly good three star tourist hotel then by all means you can stay here.

We had an excellent check in when we arrived, however, the problems started occurring when the receptionist sent us to the fifth floor with the wrong room key.

This was the only hotel on our trip which was not upgraded. Reading the bad reviews ahead of time, I was quite concerned......don't be, unless you are a picky traveller. If you haven't travelled in Europe before, and you aren't used to the hotel room sizes, yes you'll find it small. However, I have certainly stayed in smaller rooms in Europe - to the point where you almost feel claustrophobic. That is not the case here. Here are the positives: - the room is clean, quaint and cozy - the bed was very comfortable - the Air Conditioning worked very well, almost too cold - the hotel is in a great location (more about that below) - the room decor is very European - not \"outdated\" - as with much of Italy, the church bells are a charming way to wake up!! Here are the negatives: - the elevators in the hotel are very small, this is an old building, what do you expect....we found them adorable - the breakfast was a little sparse....you won't go hungry, there just isn't a HUGE selection - but the food was fine - we did run out of hot water one day in the shower About the location: - directly in front of the hotel is the water bus stop \"Ferrovia\". There are three different \"Ferrovia\" stops, if you will. You have to look at the route #'s when you get to the stop. The one directly in front of the hotel, as opposed to closer to the train station, will take you directly to Murano on the DM line. - there are many restaurants and shops nearby - just follow Lista di Spagna outside of the hotel and you'll find them - it's very obvious So enjoy - yes perhaps it's not four star but I've stayed in much, much worse than this.

My #1 suggestion for anyone visiting Venice is this. A lot of people suggest that you stay near the trainstation in Venice so that you do not have to carry your bags through the streets. They are correct that carrying your bags around venice is horrible and water taxis cost a fortune. But the Vaporetto (water bus) service is incredible and their is a stop just outside the trainstation. From there you can easily get on with your luggage and have only a short walk to any number of hotels by the numerous Vaparreto stops. So rather than staying at this dump because it is next to the station find a nicer hotel close to any Vaporetto stop. You'll need a 24 hour Vaporetto ticket anyway and you'll love being closer to St Mark's. Now for why this place was the worst hotel I've stayed in since I could afford one. We showed up and the hotel had screwed up our reservation which almost left us out of luck. We made the reservations months in advance, had a confirmaiton letter, and somehow they managed to forget to save a room for us. Luckily someone checked out a night early as we were standing at the counter and we got their room. (there is a reason they checked out early). The room was small and at first glance looked nice. Venitian glass chandalier, nice bed spread, plenty of marble, but when you looked closesly everything was really a bit dirty. The rooms were much like Venice as a whole, gorgeous on a large scale but don't look at the detail in the corners because it is quite dirty and feels like a place where people have been staying for hundreds of years. The room just felt a bit grimy. Neither the tv nor the phone worked in the room. And the staff only made false promises about wanting to fix them. I can't imagine the main elevator is actually able to pass code.

Now, I understand that sometimes things just don't go to plan, even in the best-run hotels. I consider myself a relaxed hotel guest. I had never complained about a hotel before before my stay at the Boscolo Bellini. That said, I was very disappointed in the Boscolo Bellini. I advise anyone thinking of staying there to go elsewhere. There are much better hotels in Venice that are available for much less money. 1) There was a smell from my bathroom so bad that I began gagging and retching when I opened the door. Anyone who has a septic tank that needs to be opened and drained regularly will know the kind of open-sewer smell I'm talking about. A hotel worker arrived to turn down my bed and she began gagging. I called reception and asked to be moved. The receptionist said that there was no smell and told me that it would be impossible to move me. Because my reservation was for two nights, I asked to cancel the second night for a refund so that I could find a room elsewhere. That was also refused. 2) The hotel advertises wireless internet, but this is only available IN the reception area--which is full of people most of the time (no seats, very loud, people looking at your screen!). Internet is not available in rooms. I called the hotel before making a reservation to check that there would be wireless in my room because I need it for work. I was told there would be. 3) On the second night of my stay, a fire alarm went off for over three hours starting at midnight. That is not an exaggeration or a mistake; I said three hours. According to the receptionist, it goes off whenever anyone smokes in their room. The receptionists can't turn it off for some reason and need to wait for a technician to arrive from outside the hotel. Another guest, who had been staying at the hotel for a week, told me that the same thing had happened on two previous nights during his stay. This alarm was so loud that I could not hear the phone ring and I could not have a conversation anywhere inside the hotel. It was just awful. The lack of sleep and my tiredness made my stay in Venice not much fun. 4) I ordered room service for breakfast on the first morning of my stay. It cost about 30 Euros for scrambled eggs, coffee, and bread rolls. All of these items were cold when they arrived. The coffee tasted very strange and it was undrinkable. The rolls were clearly stale. 5) Not that big of a deal for me--as long as I can sleep and the room is clean, I'm usually happy. But others expecting a four-star experience may want to know that the decor in my room was pretty sad. The carpet was dirty and threadbare, everything was scuffed and faded, there was a strong smell of mold. There was disgusting crud all over the walls of my bathroom, and like I said, the smell in there was unbelievable. I had to sleep with the windows wide open (in winter) and my coat on. Not a fun stay. I find in Italian hotels that rooms for single guests are often a lot worse than the doubles, and usually I'm not that bothered by it. But in this hotel, it was pretty bad. I had friends (a couple) staying in another room and theirs was MUCH better than mine. 6) I complained for the first time in my life to the manager about my stay--particularly the alarm situation. Other guests were doing the same thing. She told us, \"I will explain.\" Her explanation was that their fire alarm system is what it is and can't be changed. She said that we should feel sorry for the receptionist who has to deal with customer complaints every time the alarm starts going off--a frequent occurrence, apparently! She said that the smell problem is an ongoing problem at the hotel, and that customers are always moved. I told her that I was not moved even though I asked three time, and that the smell was so bad FOR MY ENTIRE STAY that I and a hotel staff member were dry retching because of it. She said that I must not have wanted to be moved. She said that there is wireless internet at the hotel. I told her that I had been told there was internet in the rooms. She said I was lying. I gave up. This experience at the hotel really ruined my trip to Venice. Summary: this was in no way a four-star experience. It was just one problem after another. The attitude of the manager was incredibly bad and unhelpful. I strongly advise everyone to stay away from this one.", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manalapan, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cA real gem at the best location in Venice\u201d", "Author": "LesTravellers", "ReviewID": "UR94766422", "Content": "This was my third stay at the Boscolo Bellini hotel.

It is an easy walk with your bag to the rental car pickup location just slightly behind the train station. I did not find it to be noisy. It is also a great locaiton because you don't have to worry about getting lost! If there is ONE THING that is signed fairly well in Venice and appears on every map, it is the train station. So we explored with confidence knowng we could find our way back. Third, the Vaporetto stop on the grand canal is really footsteps away from the front door! So you could take it right on down to St. Mark's or walk if you are game. The hotel itself is a little quirky but we liked it. The rooms were compact as they can be in European cities but very clean and nicely decorated. Kind of what I would imagine Venetian shabby chic to be like. We shopped around and in order to get something nicer we would have had to pay quite a bit more. So we went for it and if we return to Venice would stay here again. Just make sure that you know your preferences and what is important to you. Venice is the place where we spent the least amount of time in our hotel in our entire two week trip.

The first morning there I went in and turned the shower on. I looked around for the foot towel to place in front of the shower but I couldn't find it, so I grabbed another towel and placed it in front of the shower. Around 30 seconds after turning the water on I could hear the shower filling up with water so I checked to see why it wasn't draining, and I found the foot towel on the bottom of the shower, blocking the drain. Apparently this is where they place the foot towel at this hotel, instead of hanging on the shower door or rack outside the shower like every other hotel. Since I didn't have my contacts in I couldn't notice the white foot towel lying against the white shower floor (see picture). Once I got the shower drained I turned the water back on and started showering, only to notice the shower had a very slow drain, so I had to turn the water down to a slow drizzle in order to finish my shower. There is no where in the shower to put your soap or shampoo except on the floot (see picture), and because the shower was so small, it made it extremely difficult to bend down to get those items. Be careful though moving around in the shower because of the very tight quarters it's very easy to bump the handle to turn the water off. And why didn't they put the shower door on so it would open the other way without having to step over and around the toilet to get into the shower? (see picture) Well the shower is annoying, but enough with it for now because the hotel is in the perfect location. It's probably only around 300 yards from the car/bus drop off location and only 100 yards or so from the train station, which makes it really easy to walk to your hotel, even with luggage. It sits right on the Grand Canal and is surrounded by lots of shops, restaurants, atm's, etc. We took a boat out to Burano island which was great, which I would highly recommend. You can google it to learn all about their brightly colored houses there. We also bought some of the famous glassware they produce on the island of Murano. The breakfasts were good at the hotel, and the front desk staff were very helpful and courteous. The WiFi Internet is free in the lobby. The beds weren't great but were ok.

The problem was poor location of the room (overlooking rooftops and a garbage can in the rear of the hotel). Since the tub was old, clogged, and moldy, we had to complain on a daily basis for three days. They finally changed our room (same view but considered by the staff a free upgrade). The bathroom was clean & the shower stall was great. Ventilation, however, was extremely poor -- no window and a vent that was inoperative, making the area steamy after showers and smelly during high tide. Because the bedroom was very hot and the temperature could not be controlled, we were advised to open the windows and sleep over the covers. The result was a room full of mosquitoes and faces that resembled recovery from measles due to the bites. The refrigerator generated heat rather than cold; therefore, it was useless as a refrigerator.You would think that the staff of an expensive \"four-star\" hotel would be more considerate of a couple who stayed there 14 nights. Breakfast items were seldom replenished -- not matter how early or late one arrived. Eggs were always scrambled and made from powdered eggs. Orange juice was orange in name and color only. All drinks were from an automated machine; the fault did not lie with the staff. The dining area simply was uderstaffed and overworked since it had to deal with tour groups. Having said all of this, we would still recoomend it to a friend because of its location. Restaurants in the area leave a lot to be desired, unless one goes to expensive ones. Two that we would recommend are Pontini Trattoria and Bar near the bridge that leads to the Jewish Quarter and Pedrocchi on Piazza S. Geramia (the Church of S. Geramia contains the body of Saint Lucy). For those who have a long stay in Venice, we reccommend day-train-trips to Vicenza, Cividale di Friule, Bassano del Grappa, Asolo, Feltre, and Padova(only if you want to visit the Santuary of Saint Anthony).

The front desk staff were knowledable and assisted us in checking in quickly. The hotel room was pretty small. According to European standards, I would say its fairly sized. The interior looks WAY better in the photographs. It seems kind of tacky and outdated in person.. Our sheets weren't white...they seemed a bit dirty.. even when we recieved new sheets. It didnt seem like they vacuumed the room either..We didn't really mind all this because after all.. we are college students and we would only be resting there. On a brighter note, the bathroom was cute and marble. It had a full bath, bidet, toilet and sink. We were glad we didnt have to share the bathroom with other hotel guests! But let me advise you... THEY HAVE A LOT OF MOSQUITOES! Obviously, Venice is surrounded by water, but their room was swarmed with mosquitoes! We killed 5 mosquitoes the first night! And I still managed to get bit twice! For some reason, we always had them in our room. This was not fun because we hate bugs and we hate getting bit! So as a word of advice.. purchase that Off Mosquito Repellent Fan because you are definately going to need it! If I absolutely had to..I would recommend this for the budget traveler & for young singles.

Probably my least favorite part. Coffee was from a machine. Whatever. The location was perfect!!! Just steps from the train station. No need to navigate the buses. Drop your bags and go. The lobby was actually level with the street and a staff member took the luggage to our room. There was an elevator as well. (A novelty in Italy.) Our room was a triple. They let us look at it before committing. (We walked off of the street.) They even negotiated the price. It was a palace by comparison to every other place we stayed. It actually had two floors! It had a king sized bed upstairs. (Seriously, stairs.) Downstairs it had a twin bed and they set up a baby bed for my infant. It was air conditioned. And luxuries of all luxuries with children...it had a bathtub! No more screaming child in the small, cramped shower. My kids swam like they were in a pool. The bed was hard as a previous reviewer described. However, I challenge you to find a soft bed in the whole country. I did not. There was no internet. However, there was an internet cafe right across the street which we used. You are steps away from the vaporeto stop.

I would highly recommend this place. It is conveniently situated for pretty much everything. The staff are all friendly. The whole place is clean. The continental breakfast is perfectly adequate. We had a lovely room 210 on the 2nd floor not facing the front - very quiet, large, lovely bathroom. Our friends had room 208, slightly smaller with a smaller bathroom. Both nicely furnished and clean. There are two lifts. Opposite the hotel is a bar/restaurant on the Grand Canal, I would recommend this for drinks but the food is very expensive. I would not recommend the bar immediately next to the hotel entrance, very expensive for drinks. Over double for sitting outside! The hotel is really convenient for wandering. There is a bridge right outside which takes you over to more bars and restaurants and little pretty alleyways to wander along. The train station is within 2 minutes walk although we discovered you cannot get a train from Marco Polo airport to Venice so we caught the bus from right outside the airport = 3 euro each, perfect. That stops in Piazalli Roma and then you can walk, crossing a couple of bridges, to the hotel = 5 minutes. It's worth getting a 'hop on hop off' ticket for the vaporetti for the duration of your stay, then you can use it day or night to get around the Grand Canal and other waterways to the islands ie: Murano. Better value that way. There is a stop for the vaporetti right outside the hotel. Number 42 takes you to Murano island and the Cam Furnace shows you a working glass blowing factory and has a beautiful shop full of lovely genuine glass. When you've bought your vaporetti ticket, remember to validate it each time you use it, in the little machine at each boat stop. The ticket can also be used for most of Venice's bus services but we didn't take advantage of that.

The standard room we booked was relatively clean, a little worn-out and very small - not cozy, but cramped. There is only about two feet of space to walk around the bed, so luggage placement was an issue. After some maneuvering and moving some furniture, we were able to fit our big backpacks on the floor. At first glance, the bathroom was a complete contrast in that it looked like it was recently renovated with slightly a more modern feel, up to date and clean. However, once we used it, we found that the glass they used adjacent to the shower head in lieu of a curtain was faulty because a bunch of water leaked onto the floor during our showers, leaving us with a semi-flooded bathroom. Since we were only staying for two nights, we didn't even bother asking for another room, but we did tell the front desk about the issue upon check-out. Another issue I had was though the bathroom seemed new, it appears there is a lack of maintenance or upkeep in regards to the water damage on the ceiling. There was mold and mildew at the corner of the ceiling above the shower, which turned me off and tested my wills each time I showered not to stare at it in disgust.

The whole space was really airless, and I felt quite claustrophobic (I don't have claustrophobia). To add to this, the waterpipes made awful, very loud groaning noises all night that kept both of us awake. The shower blocked up so that we had to paddle - and the shower seal wasn't good, so the bathroom floor flooded. We paid around 3-4 euros per person extra for breakfast, which, once we'd seen the cost of food in Venice, was actually an incredible bargain. The buffet included bread rolls and pastries, juice and hot drinks, jams, cold meats, cheese, bacon and eggs. It wasn't very good, though - quite astonishingly for an Italian hotel, the hot drinks were truly awful (they came from a cheap motorway-service-style machine) and the bread rolls were unpleasantly tough. Overall, the hotel has a nice lobby area but the rooms themselves are like rooms in a backpacker hostel.

The beds (2 singles pushed together) were very comfortable and spacious, I had 4 wonderful nights sleep without the other half invading my space, only occasionally did he manage to relieve me of any covers. When I had a bath I found it snug, due to me being on the larger size of small (there don't seem to be many fat people in Venice) however this was preferable to a shower as I am also fairly tall and the fixed shower head was a bit to low and also more relaxing after a hot day walking around.

Venice is beautiful, I recommend a Gondola ride, although on the expensive side (100 Euros for 1 hour) there is no better way to see the REAL Venice.

After coming off of 3 nights in Rome and 3 nights in Florence and staying in smaller hotel rooms for those visits, the Bellini was a treat. We were happy with our room, the cleanliness of it, the hotel staff and especially the location. By American standards, this is probably not a 4 star hotel, but if you've read other reviews on TA, you know that for Europe this is the way it is. It is hectic in this area, being so close to the train station, however, we took a room in the back and though the view was nothing special, I appreciated the quiet. Once out the door, you don't spend much time in front of the hotel and within minutes you are out and about exploring all of Venice. As mentioned, distance to the train station was very close and that was so important to us because we had traveled by train from Florence, and it literally is a two minute walk fromt the train station to the hotel. We noticed that the water in the shower would run hot and cold, but this didn't happen everytime we used the shower. One evening we did not get the turndown service, which was strange as they did take care of this all of the other nights. We didn't mention it and felt it really was not a big deal. We each purchased the 36hour waterbus tickets, which also covered our ride by regular bus to the airport (Venice was our last city before heading home) so we felt that was a good deal. The tickets were $26 each. Overall, we enjoyed our experience at this hotel and would recommend it to others, especially if traveling by train. If we return to Venice, we would probably stay elsewhere, but only because now that we are familiar with the area, we would want to try something different.", "Date": "April 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bukwaas, MA", "Title": "\u201cNot bad\u201d", "Author": "Bukwaas", "ReviewID": "UR13325345", "Content": "Good location, right near train and vaporetto stations.

The price we paid to Hotwire was the exact same price we could have booked it ourselves and Hotwire gave us the lowest category room (with no chance for upgrades since it was prepaid through an outside service). Also, the hotel scores 4 stars on some sites, but 3 stars on other sites. The 3 star rating is the most accurate. The location of this hotel is wonderful. Walk out of the train station, turn left and walk 2 minutes; no dragging luggage on vapporettos! As stated, we had been slammed into the lowest room category through Hotwire, but had phoned the hotel ourselves saying we would pay for an upgrade. They said they would see what they could do when we arrived. As it turned out, the hotel had room to sell us an upgrade, but checked us into an unmade room, and to make good on this faux pas, they comped our room upgrade and breakfast for our 3 night stay. Andrea, the front desk manager we dealt with, was first rate and even sent up a bottle of champagne to our new, room with a balcony overlooking the Grand Canal. Good end to the story. Venice is old and expensive, so you have to take that into consideration in any hotel. Our canal view room was very nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tall ceilings, lush drapes, excellent appointed bathroom original oils on the walls, and a nice big balcony.

There are plenty of places to grab fresh breakfast and coffee right next to the hotel (and less expensive that 18 Euros). Again, we felt that we lucked out in dealing with Andrea when we checked in. Later in our stay we phoned the front desk letting them know we had laundry that needed to be done; we also told the front desk on our way out. Upon returning that afternoon, we found that no one had picked up our laundry, and the maid had left our dirty laundry and filled-out laundry request sitting on top of our made-up bed.

We found the hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful they recommended good reasonable restaurants to us.", "Date": "June 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff and location, OK hotel\u201d", "Author": "moynishan", "ReviewID": "UR5287611", "Content": "We actually ended up coming in a day early due to my err; however, they did not have us in the system at all (we were supposed to be there the next day for 2 nights) - it seems there was a problem w/ their internet and it overbooked. We were asked to sit in the lounge area where we were treated to a long overdue cold beer (that was great) while they figured out what they could do for us. They came back and said they found a room in the hotel and could accommodate us for the whole time we were there - we were very grateful and relieved. Then we went up to the room - the smallest room (for the most price) we stayed in in Italy. There was not much room for the luggage let alone moving around in, but we figured it would be fine and there was no way we could ask to be moved since they apparently dug hard to find the room for us. Then came the bathroom (however very clean) - I'm small and I could barely move in there. The shower was way under par even for European standards (my husband is 6'3\" and managed in other rooms' small showers on our trip, but this one was definitely a struggle). But the smallness of it was not the only problem - there was no cold water (yep you read that right - cold), so since no water came out of the cold faucet at all we had to take scalding hot showers (yes, extremely quick ones) all three mornings. The bathroom sink had its share of problems w/ water and pressure as well. But on to the rest of the positive stuff. Again, the staff is great - very friendly and helpful. The location is excellent, esp. if you're coming in from the train station - it is literally maybe 400 meters from the station. The express water bus to Murano stops right in front of the hotel (I highly recommend Murano - better glass items and not super crowded). We spent money on the water bus and have no idea why - we were never asked to show our tickets, so buying bus tickets seemed to have been a waste of euros. The rest of Venezia is certainly walkable from the hotel but it can be a hike; however, there is public transportation (and if it's free or not is debateable, of course) which is very close to the hotel.", "Date": "May 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cWe'd stay there again!\u201d", "Author": "NOLATravellers", "ReviewID": "UR5225662", "Content": "The Bellini is a 4 star with a very convenient location on the Grand Canal just a short walk - 200 yards - from the train station. We paid 150 E; stayed 4 nights May 2006. Nicely decorated; plenty of atmosphere. Small lobby, not a place to linger but who cares, Venice abounds with piazzas to hang out in with a glass of wine. The first room we were brought to was tiny, dark and overlooked a busy side street - noisy. We immediately asked to be moved and this was done with a minimum of fuss. The second room was 50% larger and over a quiet alley. Keep in mind - altho the Bellini touts the Grand Canal, only 4 rooms actually overlook the canal. The windows are important as according to the front desk here and at other hotels in Italy and Austria in May, the city hadn't turned on the AC. It certainly was warm enough to warrant it but apparently the government didn't think so! Being up on a higher floor and over a quiet alley was fine. Bathroom was spacious, all marble, two sinks. We did need assistance with a shower that refused to work two mornings, the water was fine coming out of the tub spigot but not the shower. The bellman was prompt, apologetic and fixed it. The only caution on this hotel is the outrageous price for breakfast! Not posted anywhere - we had a shock when we were charged 36euroes for 2 in the salon room. Although it was a more than ample spread, hot and cold and wonderful service, we don't care to eat that much and the next several mornings were much happier walking out the hotel, turning left and and walking into a cafe/restaurant called Brek. Great cappucino, warm or cold breakfast pastries and rolls all freshly baked. For about 7euroes for two! Very convenient to the vaparetto, it's a very short walk to the stop in front of the train station. Great for coming and going from either the Piazzale Roma (from the airport or rental cars) or the train. For 150E/night, we'd stay there again.", "Date": "May 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel, but a trek from the main attractions\u201d", "Author": "shil0846", "ReviewID": "UR5191868", "Content": "We stayed at the Bellin for a night in May 2006 in a standard room.

Also, the river bus is 10 euros per person for a single ticket and the cost can add up. On the plus side the hotel is close to the river bus terminal and also the train station and the coach park.", "Date": "May 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cVery Italian!\u201d", "Author": "Paristravels", "ReviewID": "UR4350075", "Content": "We stayed at the Bellini for New Year and really enjoyed our time at the hotel and in Venice.

There was a very slight smell of what seemed to be effluent when taking the stairs to the room and it was always brief and in the very same place. The room was a decent size and the bed firm and excellent. Sheets were changed daily.

When we arrived we were informed of an unfortunate booking mistake and we're asked if, for the first night, we would accept a deluxe room at their five star Boscolo Dei Dogi hotel with complimentary water taxis to and from that hotel. We were treated to a luxiourous rose garden suite on the lagoon. (See that review). It was so sumptuous and unbelievably beautiful that we asked about continuing our next two nights at the Dei Dogi, but for an additional 200 Euros per night (although well worth it) we could not justify the expense. So we resigned to going back to the four star Bellini and thought we would be disappointed. The Boscolo Hotel Bellini is a great hotel. We were not disappointed after the Dei Dogi, but the staff still sent us a complimentary bottle of an excellant chilled champagne. The rooms were beautifilly appointed with marble flooring, rich fabrics and murano glass chandeliers and wall lighting. We loved our room for it's elegance and the staff for their helpfulness. We had a large stone balcony facing the Grand Canal to view the gondolas and easy access to all forms of canal transportation. Also, the Bellini is located next to one of the few bridges that cross the Grand Canal which is a huge plus, but although passable, the bridge was under renovation and not as pretty as usual. The hotel is located on Rio Terra Lista Di Spagna a lovely brick passage which windingly connects to Piazza San Marco. It is a hub of activity and shopping with wonderful people watching.
