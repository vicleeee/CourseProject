The hotel is a way away from the main city centre. We had looked that up before hand and were not phased by it. However there is a bus stop just outside and two buses 22 (and 47 if I remember correctly) that take you into the city. They ran till late and frequently. A taxi cost about 15 Euros and between 18-20 for a 7 seater which was still reasonable specially since we were splitting it between the 5 of us. The hotel was clean, the staff were nice and friendly. It was bit of an issue getting the safe to work, which we figured out eventually. The staff did try to help and couldn't make it work at first but did offer to have a new one brought in if I wanted them to. The heating was a little low for my liking and they brought me two additional heaters very promptly on request so I could heat up the room to my liking. One day when I didn't want the cleaners in my room, I left the do not disturb sign on the door and no one entered my room in my absence and I was left a note explaining why the room hadn't been cleaned.(Which is exactly what I expected and wanted) We were out late on both the nights and had no problems getting in at 2:00 am and 5:00 am respectively. We received a friendly greeting for the lady at receptions both days We wanted some cutlery for some take away we had brought in and the staff were very helpful and accommodating with that too. We did have to pay a one off tax of around 8 Euros per room for the stay, which was not much but was a surprise. My room was on the 5th floor and due to the layout I had to take one lift to the 3rd floor and then walk across and take another to the 5th which was not that difficult also just unexpected. And lastly the bathroom door and walls are transparent on one side and has frosted glass on the other side, which is fine for a couple but we did feel oddly to start with when we went with friends. However once we got there we realised you wouldn't actually see into the shower unless you meant to do so. However, this may still be a bit odd if you are not a couple. All in all a good stay!

We booked the hotel because of its good reviews, price and location to Amsterdam city. The location of the hotel is excellent. A number 22 or 48 bus outside the hotel takes you into the Central station in 10 Minutes. Buses are every 15 minutes. We arrived by car, so it was quite simple to find the hotel off the A10 ring road. The hotel charged 22 Euros for 24 Hour parking. The parking lot is located beneath the hotel, and quite tricky getting in and out. The Receptionists were very helpful and efficient. We booked in early (11 o'clock), which was fine by the hotel, but they advised they couldn't alocate us a room until everybody had checked out and the rooms cleaned. This was no problem, as it let us into the city to explore. We returned to the hotel late at night and got allocated our room keys, which was no problem. We didn't use the restaurant, but we did use the bar, again was fine. The rooms are spotless and functional, with comfy beds. Only issue was the single beds pushed together to make a double bed. The soundproofing of the rooms was not very good. We were on the 1st floor and were woken in the early morning by the staff moving tables in the restaurant below, preparing for breakfast. Our room was also next to a Fire Door, making a banging sound reverberate through the rooms whenever anyone went through the door. A party of approx 4 youths were staying at the end of our corridor constantly going through the fire door and shouting. I called the night porter who did come up to reprimand the youths (Brits I'm sad to report), which did help for a while before the noise started back up again. Overall, the hotel is nice, clean, functional, easy accessible, but If I were to stay there again, I would ask for a room on the upper floors, at the end of a corridor. We didn't take the breakfast option (17 Euros each), deciding to take our breakfast in an Amsterdam cafe.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cQuirky Fun In Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "Geoff F", "ReviewID": "UR127935582", "Content": "This is the 3rd time I've stayed at the Art Hotel.

Cabs will run you 14 EUR or more, so this is a much more affordable option. B.) The hotel is beautiful, artsy, and CLEAN! The rooms are larger than your average European hotel room and quite modern. Our room was really nice with a LARGE bathroom. The beds were comfortable and the facility itself was quiet....no loud street noise or party's. C.) The staff was accommodating in every way.

In this hotel a twin bed is a double frame with 2 single mattresses placed side by side - essentially a double bed with single duvet covers! You are very close to each other - we ended up making a 'pillow barricade' The other issue is the glass cubicle bathroom - there is some frosting on one side but the other is clear. Due to room size and large wall mirrors you can easily see each other in bath or shower. The toilet is separate but next to bed and certainly not soundproof! There is no handbasin in in the toilet either which felt unhygienic..

The only downside was that we did not get a smoking room as requested, however we did book the night before on a bank holiday weekend so this was understandable! The hotel is not far from the city centre, there is a bus stop right outside and you can get good deals on public transport (about E12 per person for 48 hours, unlimited use of public transport). We chose to get the train from the airport instead of a transfer to save some cash, so picked the travel card up and went for a wander round before getting to the hotel. There is a petrol station with a small shop a couple of minutes walk away, and a supermarket and cashpoint a few more minutes down the road from that. The hotel looks very nice throughout, as you would expect from an 'art' hotel! The cows outside make it easy to spot while on the bus. We got one of the larger rooms and it was more than big enough for the two of us, and very nicely laid out and decorated. The minibar was locked but a quick phone call and someone came to empty it so we could put our own stuff in there. Didn't eat in the restaurant or drink in the bar, but it all looked very nice. We ordered the breakfast to our room one morning - E20 for a continental breakfast is extortionate in my opinion but I guess you pay for convenience. We ordered as much as we could though and it saw us through as a packed lunch as well, so that made it a bit more economical! Only cock-up was that the breakfast order on the door wasn't collected and when I went down to reception it was questioned whether I had left it out in time which was a bit annoying. However once assured they arranged for the order to be filled and extended our check-out time by an hour to make up for the delay they caused us.

The room was very clean, nicely designed and very comfortable. The hotel is a bit out of the way from other attractions but there's a bus stop outside that brings you into the centre in about 10 minutes. The bus is fairly regular, about every 15 minutes or so at off peak times. The whole hotel is decorated with lots of paintings from a Dutch painter called Brood, a nice idea even if it's not exactly my taste of art. As with the Fashion Hotel, there is a problem with service. When I booked the rooms on the hotel website, I booked tickets to the Van Gogh museum for the following day. When I asked at reception could I collect the tickets, I was told they were sold out for that day. A couple of hours later I managed to easily get tickets for that same day at another shop in town that were valid all year! This is obviously a question of training - I looked at the Van Gogh website and you can print out tickets at any time, there isn't a restriction according to date as there is with the Anne Frank Huis. The girl at reception told me that no-one asks to book those tickets and if I waited for her manager to get there, he could have a look. I don't blame her for her lack of knowledge, it's the responsibility of management to ensure that all those on the desk are very familiar with all that the hotel offers - or why bother, it just makes the hotel look unprofessional? At checkout, the bill for those tickets was still on my account - they were taken off when I explained I never got them! The day that I went to collect my tickets, I waited 15 minutes to be served while a Dutch lady jumped the queue and took the time of two people on desk. This isn't acceptable customer service. The staff seem very young to me and not that bothered about their jobs. If there are consistently lines at front desk, more staff should be employed, especially at peak times. There should be more of a system in place - an area with maps of the city, bus, parking information. As I had booked tickets - these should have been given to me at check in/ sent to the room automatically, rather than me looking for them. I have worked myself in customer service and efficiently has a lot has to do with staff training and knowledge of product and an efficient system in place that allows them to do their job well. AND motivation from management! I have since looked at other reviews of the WestCord Fashion and Art Hotels and almost every review mentions the poor service at both hotels. An exception was the staff in the bar/bistro.

This was an awful way to arrive in Amsterdam, so if this next lot of info helps one person I'll be a bit happier... the public transport tickets are on a time basis (from 1hr to 5 days) and work on buses and trams (tap in and out like Oyster cards)... if you arrive after 6pm the ticket office (which is outside central station) is shut... before 7pm you can get them (up to 4days long) in the crazy iAmsterdam (pretending to be a normal tourist info office) shop nextdoor... don't get a ticket and stand in line for a year... go straight to the little shop bit, where all the tacky postcards and salt n pepper shakers are and you can buy the transport ticket from the cash desk there. If it's after 7pm then you're kind of out of options... either jump on a tram and get a pass from the ticket booth in the middle (so weird they put a person in a booth on every tram instead of static booths)... or buy single (1hr) tickets from the bus driver and try again for the ticket shop the next day (not as cheap but A LOT less stressful!)

This year for a change we decided to stay a five to ten minute bus ride away from the bustling city centre and discovered a real gem of a hotel in the Westcord Art Hotel Amsterdam (4 star). From the moment we walked in the hotel, the hotel staff at reception made you feel very welcome. The check-in was quick and easy. Even though we arrived early in the afternoon, we were shown to the room so we could relax after our somewhat arduous journey (caused by KLM baggage drop off at Manchester Airport taking two hours just to drop our baggage off (after check in) and incorrect train directions by Tourist Information at Schipol Airport). Although we only had a 'Large Room', the room was honestly one of the best, most modern hotel rooms we had ever stayed in. A lot of thought has gone into the design of this room type and there was more than plenty of room for the two of us. We would have loved to have seen the 'Extra Large Rooms' you can book, just to see what they were like in comparison to this room. The room was well equipped. We brought our own travel iron and a hair dryer because in previous stays in hotels they are not either any available in the room or they are not very good, however, this was not the case this time. Even my wife was happy, apart from when I reminded her that I had carried them all the way from the UK and I would have to carry them all the way back! The bathroom was large, with a separate shower cubicle, bath and very large wash basin area. The bathroom had plenty of natural light, due to it being behind interior glass panel walls and there being two large windows in the room. The hotel bar area was a good size and provided the right atmosphere, whether you just wanted a drink or if you were having meals in there. The atmosphere was very friendly, aided by the very friendly bar staff. Even though we did not need them, the hotel management were always available to customers and we spotted them a number of times asking customers how there stay was and could they provide any additional help or advice. After staying in two five star hotels in Amsterdam centre in the past few years, (Grand Hotel Krasnapolski and Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza), these two hotels could do with visiting the Westcord Hotel Amsterdam 4 star and see how to really look after their customers/visitors. If the Westcord Hotel Amsterdam 4 star, is only a four star then in our mind these two five star hotels would not even rate as three star in comparison. Although on the face of things visitors to Amsterdam may want to stay in the very centre of Amsterdam, we found the 48 bus service from right outside the Westcord Hotel was very punctual and travels into and out of Amsterdam Central Station four time an hour. In addition, the majority of trains from Schipol Airport to Central Station in Amsterdam stop at Station Slotedijk. The 48 bus travels from outside Station Slotedijk (towards Central Station) and is around five minutes to the Westcord Hotel (Hempoint). This saves time in travelling into Amsterdam and then having to travel back to the hotel in order to check in etc. At the Tourist Information office at Schipol Airport, we purchased a 72 hour bus and tram pass, which also incorporated a return rail ticket to Central Station from Schipol Airport for just over 20 Euros. This is great value, as we are led to believe just a return rail ticket would cost around 7 Euros. We would definitely recommend the Westcord Hotel Amsterdam 4 Star to anyone wanting to visit Amsterdam.

The amenity was actually really good. free wi-fi and tub in the room, a tub in the bath room which is rare in the european hotel... I think 3 people can stay easily in this room.

The hotel is really lovely and is the Four Star part of the combined hotel. The other half being the three star Tulip Amsterdam Art. Rooms were spacious and well decorated and clean and had A/C and tv and a king sized bed and a couch. The only strange parts were that the toilet was in a separate room to the bathroom at the other end of the room without a sink in it. The bathroom was separated from the rest of the room with glass modesty panels. If you're not a couple, this could be potentially embarassing :-) Getting to the hotel from the airport is easy and complicated at the same time as Schipoll isn't the most logically laid out airport and the signs are far and few between. When you come out of the arrivals hall and collected your bagage, go immediately towards the right to the Tourist Information Centre (not the Aiport Info Centre). There you can buy either an all transport pass which includes tickets on the train to Central Station or you could by an I Amsterdam pass which is good if you're visiting the museums and going on cruises and includes travel. From here, take the train which is fairly well signposted to Central Station - I think this is platform 2. It's a quick journey, around 15 minutes where you'll see all the other hotels that you could have booked but are really far out of town :-) When you get to Central Station, walk to the bus stops where you can get the number 48 or 22 bus. The 48 is preferable as it stops right outside the hotel. Take this bus for about 10 minutes (around 5 bus stops) and stop at Hempoint where if you look left, you'll see the Golden Tulip hotel). You have to cross a wide road but it isn't very busy - and you're there! :-) When you want to go back into town, take the 48 again and it will take you to Central Station -from here you can take any number of trams to various destinations all covered by your multi pass card you bought at the airport. Central Station have a left luggage area with lockers costing Euro 7.30 for 24hrs. Use these to leave your stuff and travel around the city centre when you have to leave the hotel if your flight is in the afternoon. I won't comment on the sightseeing suffice to say there is a LOT to see and two nights should be enough to see most of it - I wouldn't bother with the canal cruises as you can see everything from the streets anyway. All the museums are a must (not including the drug and sex museum as these are rubbish) and you must see the red light district for a laugh if nothing else! Foodwise - Amsterdam is quite expensive compared to the UK. Have breakfasts in bakeries and cafes, and lunch too perhaps and splurge out in the evenings in a nice restaurant. Expect to pay around Euro 50 for a meal for two including one drink each. These were pretty much all restaurants. The best ones we found are: The Pantry, Leidsekruisstraat 21, 1017 RE, Amsterdam, which serves the most AMAZING Dutch food (if you thought Dutch food was all cheese and crackers, think again!) - cannot recommend it enough! Lovely service too! Closest tram stop is Leidsplein and it's about a 5 min walk from there in the heart of the tourist-restaurant-land (but believe me, it is more traditional than rip off). The other good one we found which is slightly more expensive and further out but def worth visiting if you want to eat away from the tourists District V - http://www.district5.nl/index.php where you can find the address and details of how to get there. It is around 15-20 mins on tram from Central Station and around another 7 min walk from the tram stop (tram 25 or tram 3). One of the most amazing meals (taste-wise) we've had for a very reasonable price (64 Euros for two incl one drink each) but the quality of the food rivals those of a restaurant you would expect to pay around that price per head in the UK! Additionally, there are a few cafes in the main Dam Square worth a visit - the one next to the department store on the Canal is great! Amazing cakes! Hope you enjoy Amsterdam as much as we did - on and eat before you get to the airport as everything there is rip off including McDonalds (which I hate to say we had to resort to in the end). A dish of Spaghetti Bolognaise at Sbarro was 12 Euros! and that didn't include any meat!). Oh one more thing - you HAVE to try the chips in a cone place near the Diesel Store which is just off the main shopping street Kloverniers which is right next to the shopping centre closer to the southern end of the street! The queues go round the corner and you can choose from 24 toppings!!!

I tried unsuccessfully to get it changed. I wasn't going to eat 100 euros to cancel the whole booking and the travelocity guy never got back to me as he said he would. The result was we were going to take it but we weren't necessarily going to like it (as evidenced by my sulky childish 2 hours sleep attitude when we did eventually book in). Well the room was pretty damn nice I have to admit, big purple sofa along the whole of the window side of the room, the double bed was a bit odd. Two single beds pressed tight together but in every other respect :- duvets, sheets etc. two single beds. Another nice thing was the separation of the toilet and the bath/shower room. For anyone married to someone who likes to bring a book to the loo (like for example, my wife) having access to the hair dryer, shower and big mirror can get difficult. On that subject, the mirror in the shower room must have had rear heating as it never steamed up, a really great idea which I had never seen before and I must admit would have gone unnoticed had my wife not brought it to my attention. Actually if you saw my hair most days you wouldn't find it all that surprising. Okay if you are going to stay in this hotel you need to know a few things though. I'll bullet-point them as that looks nicer:- 1. Buy a GVB ticket in the white tourist building outside the train station. We bought one for 96 hours it was 18 euros each and that is an absolute bargain. 2. Apparently you can get a 22 bus which we did the first day and I'll give the driver his dues, without us telling him where we were going he stopped and told us \"The Golden Tulip is up there 150yds!\" He has obviously seen a lot caught like us. Forget the 22, it's a b*llocks walking those 150 yds needlessly. You want the 48 and you want to get off at Hempoint. The hotel is the one across the dual carriageway with the stupid cows out front. There are no crossing facilities but it isn't so busy that you are risking your life to get across. The stop for getting back in town is also very close to the hotel but smells very strongly of p*ss which I find odd for an open-air bus-stop. I suspect someone with a weak bladder gets off at this stop late at night, Monday to Friday. During our 4 day stay possibly the same person also managed to lose a pair of shoes one night and an umbrella the next. Which tells you another thing about Amsterdam, there may not be great street hygiene but the beer is bl*ody good. 3. Having done Anne Frank's house before and I have to say it is the best thing to do in Amsterdam, this time we went to the Rijksmuseum (very, very good), Bols experience (close to the Rijksmuseum and actually pretty good. You'll get the admission price in alcohol alone believe me), Resistance Museum (really interesting - make sure you take the headphones which are free but without my eagle-eyed wife the ladies-who-lunch at the counter weren't for mentioning it - oh you'll need ID in case you run away with the headphones or whatever), Canal tour - we took the 100 things to see one, there are probably 1000's of things to see however the commentary which was recorded, only mentioned a dozen or so, last time we took the night time wine and cheese tour which was great. I drank the admission and I'm sure my wife had a damned good attempt, never mind the cheese. Last time we were in Amsterdam we went to the Van Gogh museum which also was really worth doing. 4. You really need to try and familarise yourself with the trams and buses in Amsterdam. You can get a map in the white tourist building mentioned earlier outside the train station. Blue lines are buses and if you look along the line you see the numbers which traverse that line, red lines are trams and follow the same rules. If you master that you have Amsterdam at your beck and call. 5. Behind the Rijksmuseum (the other side from the Vondelpark and across the canal bridge) is a street I have no idea of its name but it is full of galleries and antique dealers. Really nice one to peruse. 6. Again I have no idea of the street but Dam Square has a great little street of restaurants etc. We went to Gauchos one night, it was really expensive but we were on holiday so what the hell. It's not real life on holiday. We had a look at the menu, I was going to get a steak at 40 euros and the sides were extra! There was a slight problem in that we were very close to the front door and were getting very cold from the draught. I asked the waitress if we could move to the tables against the side of the room from the draught. I have to admit they were tables for 4 however there were quite a few not taken and it was getting quite late. I'm not usually quick to ire however she replied \" NO, you can go to this one\" (indicates table beside ours). I reacted without thinking and went to leave immediately but then felt a bit embarrassed that my wife may have felt differently so we had a short discussion during which the waitress \"explained\" to our slow types that we could take the table ( 2 seater beside us still in the draught) but we would have to wait until they had cleaned it. Lovely wife told them where to stick it and we went to the steak house literally opposite. Much cheaper and genuinely the best steak I have ever had. 7. Wagamama is bloody great, you'll find it off Leidesplein. By the way look out for the hotel discount cards they look like mini postcards - they will get you at least a beer in Wagamama (per card). 8. For some reason it costs at least 30 cents for a p*ss in Amsterdam toilets, this is even in bars and some restaurants. This is how much it was it was in the department store off Dam Square don't know it's name but basically get off the 4.9.16.24 or 25 bus from Central Square and take the first stop and the shop is to your East. It has about 5 floors and it has a brilliant restaurant at the top. Trust me, it is great - not necessarily cheap but you're on holiday, you can't be cheap either. I suppose I should finish with the hotel. We never ate in it, small choice and looked dear, but if you are the type who go on trips to see the city and want a comfortable bed at night with a reasonable degree of luxury this hotel will do the job. The bus is only ten minutes and you need the tickets to get anywhere in Amsterdam anyway. Check the price of this hotel with the hotel in the area you want and if there is a reasonable saving, take this hotel, you never wait more than ten minutes for a bus and the ride as I said is only ten minutes. Internet was expensive, we didn't bother, I think the lobby will give you a keyboard and there is free wifi (possibly).

The restaurant has a little outside area facing the pool. Comfortable, secure underground parking lot. Hotel is 3 miles away from city center. Bus stop right in front of the hotel (we didn't use the car at all) with buses coming every 15-20 minutes. Fot those who like Burger King, there is one 3 minutes away by car. In all it is very nice and I would definately recommend it and stay there again. I wish I could share more pictures so everybody can see why I liked it so much, too bad I could only share 10!

Having read previous reviews, we knew the hotel was situated out of town, that said, the public transport was fantastic. You can catch the number 48 bus to central station, which is right in the heart of the city centre. These buses stop right outside the hotel, and run approx every 15min up to midnight, when the night bus takes over and runs every half an hour.The journey into the city centre takes approx 8mins. Our room in the hotel was fab, and looked just like the pictures on the website. We had a superkingsize bed, and the bathroom was fantastic. There was not much of a view, but realistically how long do you stay in your room for? Tea & coffee facilites were available, but we did have to ask for extra tea/coffee/sugar etc, as these did not seem to get replenished very regulary. We didn't eat in the hotel, as this was quite expensive compared to restuarants in the city centre, I do feel that for the price you are paying for this hotel, breakfast should be included, but you have to pay an extra 15euro's each for breakfast. We bought travel passes at reception which can last for 24/48/72 hrs, our 3day pass allowed us to use the buses & trams anytime and cost 10.50euro's each. The canalbus was also really enjoyable, and is a nice way to see Amsterdam along the various canals, they stop at regular tourist attractions, Anne Frank House etc. You can just jump on & off as you like. A 24hr canalbus pass cost 18euro. We really enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam & the hotel was clean, and provided good room facilites. I personally felt however that the hotel lacked character & atmosphere, but the staff during our stay were very friendly & welcoming. The hotel bar stays open until about 1.00am. A taxi to/from the airport will cost you approx 40-45 euro's and takes about half an hour. I would go back to the Amsterdam Art, as you are conveniently located to the city centre, but you do not have to deal with the noise/traffic that staying in the heart of Amsterdam would bring. The red light district is an eye-opener, and is located about 10mins walk from central station.

I am sure that thanks to the staff's attitude things have not changed for the better anyway. Ok let's start from the beginning, we booked a hotel and flight deal with lastminute.com so naturally the hotel was fully pre-paid. When we arrived from the airport by cab, I already started feeling uncomfortable since I realized we were nowhere near the city center (even though the hotel claims to be in the 'historic district of Amsterdam'), as I prefer to stay in convenient locations this already made me a little uncomfortable. However since it was all pre-paid we knew that we did not have any other choice but to stay there. When we got to the concierge desk another surprise followed, as I said our 4-day stay was entirely pre-paid but the concierge (after making us wait for about 15 minutes for him to finish some typing) insisted on 'blocking' a 2 day charge on my credit card 'in case of any unforeseen circumstances'. Now this had NEVER happened to me at any 4 star hotel before and I have been to plenty. I tried to make my claim that this is not necessary but he insisted, finally tired out I handed over my card, needless to say this severely crippled my holiday budget. After quickly dropping off our luggage at the room (and making the mistake of not checking it properly) we decided to go into town for some much needed food. We walked about the red-light district where we found a surprisingly delicious Chinese/Tibetan restaurant (best Chinese food I have ever had, beats Hakkasan!) and at about 10pm we decided to go back to our hotel. After waiting for the night bus for about 40 minutes, and a 20 minute ride through the generally sketchy neighborhood the hotel is around (it's next to a train depository) we finally arrived to be greeted by not so welcoming closed doors to the hotel. After ringing the night-bell for about another 10 minutes, as well as shouting and banging on the door, the night-porter finally decided to appear and let us in (of course only after asking to see our key and id-ing us!). The next fab surprise awaited us in our room, as I said we did not give the room a thorough check when we first arrived, which since this hotel I make sure to conduct EVERY time. The shock came when I lifted the bedspread to find a yellow stain with hairs on it on the otherwise white bedding, I was literally in shock. NEVER in my life had I expected to see something like this in a 4 star hotel, probably even a roadside motel would not allow something like this. After calling down to reception and screaming at the night-porter he came up and changed the bedding himself as there was noone else in the hotel at the time, granted he did look quite embarrassed and was apologetic. After getting over my disgust I decided to go use the washroom, where I realized the sink drain was broken and leaking, so we had to brush our teeth in the shower. Throughout our 4 day stay there it was not fixed. When I complained to the daytime concierge he pretty much just raised an eyebrow at me and could not even apologize in a decent manner. My trip to Amsterdam was almost ruined by this hotel, the waste of time on long commuting to the center of town, the rude staff, the disrepair and filth shocked me. I would have gone mad if not for the generally fun city, good food and great company of my partner.

The view is not pleasant as it is a train warehouse but with little activity and, with the window closed, you can sleep comfortably.

We did not tried the Restaurant. There seems to be a swimming pool but it was too early in the season to try it. The location of the hotel needs attention: if you're looking for a place above a canal, go somewhere else. It is a little outside the historic center near a commercial area.

Sometimes we stay one or two nights in Amsterdam. The city has a wonderful atmosphere and it is not important, what time of the year it is. When going there we are usually travelling by a large van. That ist the big problem when choosing a place to stay in Amsterdam. There are some nice hotels in the city center, but no place to leave Your car - and parking in a lot is mostly more expensive than the night in the hotel. This time we looked for a comfortable place which is not too far off with the possibility to park our large van. So I choosed the Golden Tulip Amsterdam Art and booked a double-room for the cheap rate of EUR 79,-. On the next day we were very curious about what we would find there. First PRO: Parking. There is a big parking right at the hotel and for bigger cars as ours it is possible to park right in front of the entrance without problems. Second PRO: The hotel itself and the rooms are very clean. Checkin was friendly and quick. The room was very nice with the stylish bathroom behind glass. Other than in most other hotels, the toilet is a seperate room, what ist \"sometimes\" more comfortable in glassed bathrooms ;-) Third Pro: The location. OK - the hotel is not in the city center. But right in front of the entrance is the bus-stop and line 48 will bring You to the centre and main station in a few minutes. And it also brings You back until late in the night. Of course, You can also use a taxi. Perfect combination: If You are looking for a really nice hotel with quiet and comfortable rooms, a good connection to the center and no parking-problems; and that all for a very good price - this is the choice! Before that we stayed at the Swissotel (no parking), some more times at the Bilderberg Jan Luyken (walk and ride), and the Bilderberg Garden Hotel, which was some kind of old fashioned with no usable connection to the center, but a taxi. Next time we will choose the Golden Tulip Amsterdam Art again. It is the perfect combination in Amsterdam, concerning location, comfort and price!

However, it wasn't that cheap either, but hotels in Amsterdam are not very affordable in general. The location of the hotel was a little away from the Centraal Station and the main street, Damrak. You have to take the #48 bus to the Hempoint stop. A day pass costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6,30. If you stay closer to the center, you could walk to most sights. Be aware that at times this bus does not always run every 10 minutes. Only during peak times. Also, the bus passes by a bridge that rises to allow ships to pass by. This can lengthen your commute to and from Centraal Station. The bus does seem generally timely, so obtain a schedule from the transportation information office across the street of Centraal Station. The bus drops you off in front of the hotel, but across the street from it. There isn't a close by cross walk, so we had to jay walk to the hotel. Most of the time, there isn't a lot of cars on this street, but sometimes, there can be some cars speeding down the street. The area around the hotel is quiet, it looks like it is on the edge of an industrial/business part of town. There isn't much around the hotel, so you can't find restaurants, supermarkets, or convenience stores around. You have to get this in the main part of town. The hotel itself is just ok. The staff at the hotel was not very attentive or courteous. They were busy talking to each other rather than worrying about helping us check in. They even served people that were behind us first and took calls first before talking to us. We had to flag someone down before they helped us. It seems like the staff early in the morning is much more friendly and helpful than the middle of the day. They even asked if we needed a cab after checkout in the morning. The rooms were generally clean and ok size, for European standards. You had some room to move around. However, the furniture was not made of high quality materials. The counters in the room were plastic, like the types in hospitals. The carpeting was a bit worn. The ceiling of our bathroom was made of plywood and didn't have great workmanship. The bathroom was small.. They did not have a shower curtain in the shower, only a slim clear plastic panel that left 3/4 of the shower open to the rest of the bathroom. Unfortunately, if you angle your showerhead the wrong way or if you plan to splash at all, you can get your bathroom floor all wet. The bathroom was generally clean, except some edges of the bathtub had mold stains on it. An unusual aspect of this hotel is that they tried to decorate it in a whimsical artsy manner. Pieces of cheap furniture is accompanied by large paintings in the room. The rooms reminded me of dorm rooms. The decor was unusual with a stainless steel sink that looked like a kitchen sink, a decorated bathroom mirror, plain white tile on the walls, and black tiles on the floor. The beds were arranged oddly. The twin beds in one of our rooms were pushed very close together. Only 6 inches separate the two beds. They also did not change our sheets daily as requested either.

If you are intending to use public transport throughout your stay Id suggest buying a travelcard type ticket which you can use on buses, trams and tue (we didnt use the tube as its more for long journeys not around the main town). Buy it from the tourist office opposite Centraal station as you come out not one of the machines and its around 13 euros for 48 hours (also get it stamped on your first bus.tram as it needs to be validated) If you are going out at night the last 48 bus from the hotel goes at around midnight, after that you can get the 353 bus in and out of town and back to Hempoint until 6am when the 48 runs again. Nightclubs (actual dance clubs) seemed pretty scarce as most places are 'coffee shops' and bars, we wanted an rnb type club and the only one in the whole of AMsterdam (that we found and trust me we looked very hard!) was called MINISTRY this is the webite for address etc [---------]it could have been really good with good music and ok venue but the people were just pretty boring, not the kind of mad atmosphere in say Berlin for example, it was just all very stand around and do nothing than dancing and getting an atmosphere going, however we were told there were a few other places but unfortunaltey for us they were midweek places or thur/fri, these were La Rumba & Sinners. Its worth going to though it may have just been a quiet night when we went? Re the Red Light District, hhhmm good to go and say 'yes I have been there, seen it', but thats about it, very seedy and sleazy, groups of lads perving in glass windows at scarily young looking girls in bikinis trying to usher them in, that sort of thing, pick careully your time of going to check this part out best time would probably be 9-11 where its very touristy more of a laugh, couples, hen parties etc, whereas after 1 onwards its the ppl that are there to experience it first hand and not just as a tourist attraction if you know what I mean, ladies its pretty uncomfortable walking around that area at this time. During the day Amsterdam is a really pretty area and very flat so walking is easy! Its not that cheap so take plenty of spending money and be sure to do a canal cruise and the shopping is pretty good to! Everyone rides bikes so look out as you are walking as they have priority over pedestrians and it is really easy to rent them if you fancy getting around that way! Obviously if you are a smoker (we''re not) but we could see it would be heaven on earth for smokers (yes not cigarettes) as its i so chilled out and freely available!

The bus service was so punctual (admitadly they weren't frequent) that it made getting around so easy (definately reccommend buying a pass as it covers the train, tram, bus and boat!) and the night bus was totally ace as well! Felt so safe travelling home in the middle of the night. My best bit of advice is to buy a guide book before you go as finding somewhere nice to eat in the city centre is hard for picky eaters! Red light district is a must - very peculiar but really fun night out! Bars just outside of there on the canal are lovely as well.

This is our second visit to Amsterdam and as we enjoyed ourselves last year we thought we would go back and stay at this hotel again. On checking in we discovered that the hotel has a new ''policy'' where they impose a cover charge of euro 50 per day to cover any expenses you may incur. In our case as we were staying 4 days this meant an additional euro 200 plus the cost of our room. Reception staff were most insistent that we paid this immediately on checking in. This ''policy'' is not on the hotel's website and we think it should be so that future guests if paying in cash (as we were) can budget for this. We did not pay this ''policy'' charge last year. Beware of the sensors in the fridge - take any item out (even if you dont drink or eat it) put it back in the same spot in the fridge - and hey presto it is on your bill when you checkout. Be warned. Also we found the staff on reception not to be guest friendly at all. Room service was poor. We rang one evening at 10.40 to order a sandwich - room service said ''sorry the kitchen closes at 10.30''. We appreciate that all hotels must have a deadline when they close but we were not asking for a 4 course meal - just a cheese sandwich!! A little flexibility would be welcome. The Art Cafe stays open until 1.00 am for drinks but (you've guessed it) food orders close at 10.30 so no joy there! More hassle when we went to pay our hotel bill at reception at around 9.30 pm the night before our departure. After we had paid in full the receptionist asked for a further euro 50 as a deposit - we couldn't believe it. We were in fact going to bed as we had an early morning flight the next morning and were leaving at 6.00 am. The hotel seems to view all its guests as potential criminals!! The buses were unreliable and we often had a 20-30 minute wait for them (of course the other alternative was to walk)! On a more positive note, our room was in good order; spacious, clean and comfortable. Sorry that this review is all moans - but it was one 'bug'' after another.

There is also a night bus service to/from the stops outside the hotel door. So getting to and from the city centre is not a problem. It's about 10 minutes on the bus or a half hour walk. One of the airport hopper busses also runs to the hotel, although I didn't use this so can't comment on the service. The hotel itself is modern and well maintained, with helpful (english speaking) staff. The artwork is interesting, but not really to my taste. Hotel restaurant is good for evening meals, although not cheap. Bar has a small range of local beers and a selection of foreign beers and liquors. Breakfast is a good quality buffet. Do not try to go for breakfast at the last minute though - everyone else has the same idea! The rooms are spacious and clean. If you book a triple (family room) then you actually get a larger room - unlike most hotels in Amsterdam where you just get an extra bed in a standard room.
