We took a taxi from the Airport which was 57 euros, and was a 25 minute trip at a busy time. If you arrive by No. 53 Metro, turn left out of the Gastenplas Metro Station (last stop on the line) and follow the cycleway/footpath past the rear of the Campenile Hotel, then follow the footpath up the slope, and follow the footpath all the way to the road junction where the hotel sits (you will have passed a campsite on your right and the Prins Willem horse centre, also on your right). The hotel is a decent 3 star, probably about Premier Inn standard, with better public areas. The rooms are a good size. Ours room was clean. It had two single beds, desk, wardrobe, TV and table + two chairs. Reasonable bathroom with shower gell and tissues, but no hairdryer (you can borrow from Reception for a deposit). The Lighthouse Bar and Flavours restaurant are pleasant public spaces, and both serve food. We ate dinner in each and the food was good - 15 to 20 euro for mains, but also sandwiches and pasta, salads from 6 to 11 euros. Breakfast was good too, with fruit salad, cereals, pastries, cold meat, cheese and scrambled eggs and bacon (but no baked beans!)...Drinks prices were ok for a hotel with 3 to 4 euros for a glass of wine. Hotel staff were polite efficient and helpful. It was a fairly quiet hotel and we slept well. In good weather there is a riverside terrace to enjoy the location. The hotel is located on the outskirts of Amsterdam, but you can catch a Metro (53) into Central Amsterdam. We got a 24 hour ticket for 7 euros. The Metro station is about 15 minutes walk from the hotel. It's a pleasant walk in the daytime, but not one I would want do alone late on a winter night (taxi from the Centre of town a much more expensive, but better bet). We had no problems with the Metro, which is an efficient service. Get off at Waterlooplein and you avoid the crowds at the Central Station. We thought the hotel was good value. It would be particularly suitable if you were arriving by car as there is a large free car park, and you could avoid the cost of parking in Central Amsterdam.You are also well placed for some car trips to the coast or villages etc. If you intend to spend most of your days in Central Amsterdam, it may better to consider a more central hotel and pay more, especially if you plan being out late a lot. As for the hotel itself, it was good value, and we would have no problem in staying there again.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "osann-monzel", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing, but close to the metro.\u201d", "Author": "moony606", "ReviewID": "UR123431396", "Content": "The room was very hot, since there was no AC and it was NOT clean.

The staff at reception was very friendly, checkin was smooth. The first room we entered was not cleaned at all, there was stuff on the floor and the bed wasn't made. Upon reaching the reception the girl quickly gave us another room -the night before there had a major dance party nearby, and the hotel had been booked out. Since they only had one cleaning lady on duty, not all rooms were cleaned. The second room was in the other end of the hotel, which we reached by going through several very badly maintained hallways: stains in the carpet, wallpaper peeling off, lights falling off the wall, mold on the room doors. The room was not much better; it looked clean at first sight, but turned out to be pretty badly cleaned and apparently not maintained at all. There were many stains on the floor and walls, there was soap stains in the bathroom, the faucet was glued together with old, brownish glue. We decided to bear it, after all we were only paying 20 euros for the room. We were completely grossed out when we found the remote control though: it contained food stains of at least 20 previous tenants. When we handed this remote control to the reception, they quickly gave us yet another room. This one eventually turned out just fine. It was still old and not maintained, but clean enough.

Some other negative points are that they have a very unfavorable cancellation policy of 48h and they don't hesitate to bill you when you cancel even a few hours too late. Being a business hotel this is unusal. The other unhappy aspect is that you are in the middle of nowhere. The closest train station is a relatively long walk away - roughly 15 min.

OK so the place could do with a little updating, but I read reviews all the time, and travel in the UK & abroad, and people need to start taking more notice of the star ratings.

About midnight we heard a commotion outside our window - someone entertaining a \"giggling lady\" and at 2:30 am the same couple approached from outside our hotel door giggling and then OPENING our door. I flew out of bed, I had my two teenage daughters with me, and barely slammed the door shut. They had given the key to my room to the guy and his date! I told him we were in the room and he tried AGAIN to open the door, telling me it was his room. Insight Vacations had assigned us this room and our luggage was delivered to the room, When I called the front desk, I was informed that the rooms had been entered in the computer wrong and no one even apologized. I told our tour director from Insight, Raymond and he just laughed and said that was a first for him", "Date": "July 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Girona, Catalunya", "Title": "\u201cIt's not what it seems (sadly)\u201d", "Author": "GuillemTM", "ReviewID": "UR8751565", "Content": "It's not an hotel for visitang Amsterdam. We already know it and we took it as a base to travel by car. Even then we've been satsified. It's a very long building. You have to take a long walk to go to some rooms. The rooms aren't specially confortable, although they're very big. The receptionists weren't helpful and seemed to not know some basics of the hotels. There was no \"do not disturb\" sign in our room and we asked for it. When they got to know what we were asking they said they'd do something about it. We asked again later and they told us they have said to the room service to leave it there, hanging on the door. We told us to not leave it hanging in the door, because we'd be out all the day. Our fears came true at night when we got back. The sign was hanging in the door and the room wasn't cleaned. The room service thought we were in. Don't even think to eat in the brasserie. Or... yes, do it. It was a complete disaster. We decided to eat there because we were tired and we spent 2 hours there, most of the time waiting. Waiting to be asked, waiting the dinner and... no! Not the note! This was fast. Luckily, as it was a complete disasters, they got wrong in most of the things and our dinner ended being 10 euro cheaper as it was supposed to be. Most of the customers there were really angry. The breakfast buffet was correct.

That being said, I have to state that I have stayed in this hotel a couple of times recently while being on business trips. LOCATION: This 3-storey hotel is conveniently located off the A9-motorway near Gaasperplas and has a big parking lot (though even this one can get quite full at times). About 1 km (0.6 mi) away is the terminus of a Light Rail line which will take you to City Center of Amsterdam. There are no other buildings in the vicinity of the hotel. To visit a restaurant you best have a car available (or get a taxi). ROOMS: ... are quite large in size with a roomy bathroom. No real problems with cleanliness sofar. Beds are firm and comfortable. Numerous rooms face the street, but noise is not a problem here. A few rooms have a balcony overlooking a canal. The micro-fridge is always locked and I never cared about it. There is no Wireless-LAN in the rooms and also only the \"business rooms\" have a dataport - and this is of the local style only, rather than the usually found outlet for Western-plugs. Trying to find a adaptor for it can be difficult. RESTAURANT: Food in the evening is good (\u00c3\u00a1 la carte) with the set menu\u00c2\u00b4s offering the best deals. The restaurant is also frequented by non-hotel guests. Breakfast is a mix of continental and american style with a local touch. Beware: Upon my recent trips, almost every morning there was a tour group of chinese tourists in the hotel: Not every morning the hotel staff was paying attention, that these groups have a seperate area set aside for their breakfast - so it became rather full in the breakfast area. SERVICE: Apart from a single occasion where I got checked-in into a room that appeared to be occupied by a member of hotel staff, I haven`t run into any further problems. As I am a return customer, check-in is accomplished very fast - no more forms to be filled out for me. Upon my last check-out, staff surprised me when they were aware that I would return 3 weeks later ... (another 2 weeks in this hotel for business). COSTS: With a negotiated company rate, this hotel costs only a fraction of the hotels downtown plus parking is free !", "Date": "November 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Asten", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel for groups\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5039582", "Content": "If you are a group visiting amsterdam for nightlife it is a clean and friendly hotel.

This walk takes about 20 minutes, and there is NO other option. Buses do not run down this block, and cab companies will not come only to take you to the train station. Once you get to the train station, it is about a 20 minute ride to Centraal Station. This hotel is not at all centrally located to ANYTHING.
