My only gripe about the room was the shower. It's got a weird half shower door that swings open. Maybe I'm just not used to that style but I found it a little odd and water did tend to get on the floor. The rooftop bar / restaurant is definitely worth the trip up to the top floor for the view....but definitely not the service. We waited 15 minutes for someone to come greet us, however no one came. We were the only two there and at least 5 staff members that we could see. We took a couple pictures from the outdoor patio and left. Probably was for the best as we found a great little cafe up the road where the entire meal cost less than a couple of cocktails would have in the on site bar / restaurant. What really made the stay 5 stars vs 4 stars was the front desk and door staff. The front desk folks were always accommodating and gave us great tips on which sites to see, the best and cheapest ways to get there, etc. I felt like we asked way more questions than your average traveler and they were always happy to help.

It wasn't a great start as when we arrived the room wasn't ready and two hours later after asking Reception, we were told it had been ready for over an hour and 'my colleague should have told you'. The room was large and comfortable but the paint was peeling in the bathroom and it needed some work, and our view of Rome wasn't there and our view of the 'Gardens' was a rear empty courtyard with 3 trees in it. There was one free bottle of water in the room of about 350 ml's, hardly enough for two glasses of water per person, therefore you needed to purchase the mineral water from the bar fridge. Just a bit on the mean side, but okay not really a big issue. The shower was unusual, it was an old style hand held shower in a bath, but they had installed a rain shower head at a later stage. The funny thing was that where they positioned the shower head, you virtually had to stand on the end of the bath to get under it, so one foot in the bath the other on the top of the bath. Also the pressure was so poor that getting conditioner out of your hair was difficult, the water temperature was lukewarm and ran hot and cold and it was strictly one towel each per day. Not really what you expect from a 5 star hotel. The room service wasn't a success either, after the first day I felt like something simple so ordered a hamburger. All was fine other than the room service lady seemed offended by the intrusion and the bread roll was so stale it was a biscuit and crumbled when touched. The public areas were limited to a breakfast room and the Terrace Bar and Restaurant, which was nice with great views, but overall the hotel was a bit poor on alternatives compared to the Intercontinental down the road. The location is great but the obvious nickel and dimming spoils the experience, not really a 5 star hotel more a 3 star. There are other better options available in the same area for much the same cost.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLuxury\u201d", "Author": "keymoney", "ReviewID": "UR121072478", "Content": "This is a great hotel to base your stay visiting rome.

As with most italians, they don't just do what you ask, they give you a detailed personal opinion to help. Check in and straight to the bar on the top floor. Lessons in making cocktails from the bar staff. (They were not too busy....) Great balcony by the bar. Excellent bourbon old-fashioned on the house for new arrivals. Breakfast staff also polite and friendly, but need to speed up a bit. Best hotel breakfast omelette for a while though. Breakfast would be better if it was in a room with a view, not the basement, but the selection and quality of produce is good. Good room - strong but quiet air-con, amazingly comfy bed, good minibar without those annoying automatic pads on them. So you can go to shop down the road, stock up on cheap booze and put it in the fridge! One small problem with the leaky sink was fixed within minutes. We had a problem opening the safe and this was also fixed within minutes by security. We only think this misses out on excellent because the water pressure in the bathroom was a bit low. If you want a bath you need about 30 minutes to fill it. Admittedly it's a big bath. The hot water wasn't too hot for the first couple of days but suddenly improved. Nice Hermes bath products. It looks as though a \"lounge bar\" is being added to the hotel on the ground floor. Good news. This would put the icing on the cake here.

I spent 3 nights here in Sept 2011 and wasn't very impressed by the hotel at all, save for the winsome buffet spread at breakfast and the Herm\u00e8s toiletries provided by the hotel, which smelt and felt absolutely divine, both of which are admittedly the best I have come across amongst all my hotel experiences around the world, and I have stayed at a far number of hotels through the years. To begin with, for what we were paying for, the hotel could have been in a better location. While I definitely wouldn't call the location bad, I didn't consider it to be ideal as well. Spanish steps and the main shopping belt was a good 10-15 min walk away and with heavy shopping to lug, that distance certainly wasn't something I appreciated. Another grouse was the lack of space on the hotel grounds. There were no beautiful outdoor courtyard, gardens or even a pool for guests to enjoy some sun and fresh air. And for a hotel that calls itself a \"luxury\" hotel, I certainly was expecting much more from the fittings, furniture and layout of the hotel. The corridors were tiny, while the fittings and furniture used in the rooms didn't look anywhere near the posh I imagined a luxury hotel to have though I have to say a big plus point was the unexpected spaciousness of the hotel rooms. To sum it up, I would stay here for the excellent breakfast, wonderful toiletries and spaciousness of rooms if I wasn't so particular about location and having a pool and nice grounds in the hotel to catch a breather and some sun. Unfortunately I am big on both, and also hard to please when it comes to delivering on value - something which I felt this hotel fell short of as well. For what you end up paying for, you might as well top up a little more for a better, bigger hotel in a better location with nice hotel grounds. Unless you don't intend to leave your room in Rome.

We've had problems in other hotels (and cruise ships) where the sheet isn't enough and the duvet is too much -- you can't get the room cool enough to use the duvet and I hate sleeping in a warm room.

In other words, realised that they had given them a plate with flour in, and didn't say anything.

The Sofitel looked lovely in the photos, inside and out, and I have to say: it definitely lived up to them! Upon our arrival to Rome, we were hopeful that this hotel would be up to the standards that its price tag promised - especially after so many people had informed us that the standards of luxury are so different in Italy as compared to the States. We chose the Sofitel after considering several other hotels that have prime locations to see all the tourist attractions like the Trevi Fountain and the Piazza Navona, and this proved to be a great choice. We were up on the hill near the Borghese Gardens, and we were within walking distance of all the things we wanted to see and do. Because the Softiel is atop a hill, the view from the rooftop terrace was amazing & definitely worth it, but it also means that returning to your room after a day of marathon sight-seeing can be a bit of a climb, but as we sipped wine at sunset overlooking St. Peter's and the Villa Medici, we agreed that the Sofitel was an excellent choice for us and sooo worth the climb up that hill every afternoon!! Outside, the building is a lovely warm gold and all the architectural details are intact. There are modern touches at the entrance, like two wrought iron orbs with gas torches on them that are lit at night. We arrived around 10 a.m. in the morning and were greeted warmly by the doorman who, after an easy check-in, immediately tagged our bags for holding so we could walk around the city until check-in at 3. All the staff were smiling and happy to greet us and spoke English. When we returned early (around 2), we were glad to learn that our room was ready, and we took the elevator up to the 2nd floor. All the common areas are very clean and well-appointed, VERY elegant - and the same is true for the hallways and stairwells. There are crystal chandeliers, beautiful painted moldings and comfortable, elegant seating groups in the lobby areas. There is also a series of provocative artwork in the lobby with some nudity, but unless you were with really observant kids, I wouldn't worry... I wasn't offended or anything - it all lent a very artistic, tasteful and contemporary touch. The room was not giant (as expected), but for a couple with luggage, it was more than ample space - and the best part: the air conditioning was already running and the room was nice and cool! This was great, because we were there in late June/early July and daily temps were in the low to mid 80's every day. The window treatments, carpets, bathroom fixtures, and bedding were all lovely and clean. The safe, TV, lamps, etc. all worked wonderfully - no problems whatsoever. Our bathroom had a nice deep tub and shower with a movable glass panel that kept most of the water off the bathroom floor - all the fixtures worked fine - no issues with the plumbing & ample hot water. I took two wonderful, hot baths during our stay because my body was weary from all the walking and climbing we did every day - it was a Godsend for tired legs and feet, and I was really glad for this unexpected bonus in the room. We were able to borrow an iron from the room staff, and there was an ironing board in the room, so that worked out fine. We learned later, as we continued on our trip, that irons are NOT always available from the hotel (let alone standard in the rooms), and that it is common for a hotel to offer a laundry service for a fee if you need something steamed or pressed. This led us to get creative with some water and a blowdryer at some of our other hotels along the way because we didn't have time to send our clothes out the day before if we had just arrived and needed a dress or shirt pressed for dinner that night. So, either bring a travel iron or go rumpled! Overall, I would highly recommend staying at the Sofitel. We were extremely pleased by the room. The hotel has one of the best views from their rooftop terrace (where they also have a really cool & swanky bar area), the rooms are clean, cool and comfortable, and it has a great location.

Sofitel always have high standards and I would choose this chain over others when I can. The hotels never seem to have such a 'corporate' feel but retain an element of intimacy. The staff are always impeccable. Sofitel Roma Villa Borghese has been our favourite so far. We were so comfortable in our room with views over the vatican and they kindly placed our daughter right next door, she also had wonderful views and quite frankly couldn't believe her luck. The rooms are traditional so if you are looking for modern minimalism then it is not for you. The beds are wonderful, you can actually order them for your home, I slept so well here - perhaps it was all the walking. The roof top terrace/bar is very stylish and it is lovely to sit and have a drink early evening whilst the sun goes down. Yes, prices are expensive, but everything is expensive in Rome and afterall it is a 5* hotel. We were only able to have one breakfast due to our reservations at the sites and the menu was a little limited for us as we did not want to have the full buffet just something small. They were very accomodating though and allowed us to order from the room service menu. The staff make this hotel. Reception is always charming, Luigi on the door is such a character and we enjoyed his banter, concierge helpful and interested in what you are doing. We loved the location, it is a 10 minute walk to the Spanish Steps and all the shops and restaurants that are in this area. It is not so near to the old rome sites but taxis are reasonable and the metro is nearby. I would think in cooler months the walk would be pleasant. The great thing about the hotel is that it is in a quieter neighbourhood, we needed that after the crowds and hustle and bustle of Rome. (The hotel is 5 minutes walk to the museum Villa Borghese - unmissable but if you want to go book your tickets in advance - that advice goes for everything in Rome - it makes life so much easier).", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cBorghese\u201d", "Author": "LawsonsScotland", "ReviewID": "UR118235010", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights and had a superb time,the hotel very well located for Spanish Steps and other tourist attractions.The hotel was very good and had a great view from lounge/terrace on top floor.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cLuxury, Great View and Great Location\u201d", "Author": "bmase58", "ReviewID": "UR118170371", "Content": "My wife and I were pleasantly surprised by this hotel.

One of the rooms had a loud air conditioner noise that they could not fix right away so they gave us another room down the hall so my husband and one child had to sleep there which left me alone in my room...not ideal. The prices in the hotel restaurant/bar were ridiculous. We got back to the hotel late one night and the local bars were closed and we wanted gelato so we went to the hotel rooftop restaurant and even though it was not closed yet they obviously wanted us to take it back to our rooms to eat it which we did....it was over 60 euros for 5 small scoops of gelato. It was so overpriced. The concierge booked us a private tour of both the Roman Coluseum and the Vatican, one each day. On the second day, we had booked a 3 hour tour and after about 1.5 hours the tourguide told us that he had to leave after just 2 hours. We were not told by the Sofitel that the guide could only do 2 hours. Frustrating. The worst part of the stay was that they were doing painting in the area right outside our rooms. They got there early in the morning and the smell of paint was all in our room. Since we had our kids next door we were walking back and forth between the rooms and had to walk around scaffolding and paint buckets....totally unacceptable if you ask me. They should have painted areas that had vacancies or purposely not booked rooms near where they had to paint. We just felt that the hotel was not up to par at all.

We'd already stayed four days at Hotel Campo Di'Fiore (which we loved) and gone on a 7-day cruise before returning for a last night in Rome. From the outside, the hotel looks like an elegant palazzo. Inside, it's a blandly elegant hotel that could be in any mid- to large-size city. The positive: Our room was vast, beautiful, and quiet with an adjacent sitting room containing a daybed for our daughter. We even had a small balcony. The bathroom was luxurious and supplied with Hermes toiletries. The bed was decadently soft with pillows you'll want to smuggle home. And if you're a fan of muscular, American-style air conditioning, you'll be thrilled. Nowhere else in Rome did I feel that familiar blast of \"at the mall\" cold. The concierges were unfailingly polite and helpful. The negative: Let's talk about location. The neighborhood is quiet but it's quiet in a deserted kind of way. I got the feeling I was in a business area as there wasn't much in the way of food shops or even stores and restaurants. It's an easy walk to the Spanish Steps, Via Veneto, and the Corso but as I soon discovered, these are my least favorite parts of Rome. If congregating with throngs of your fellow tourists is your thing and posing with someone in a gladiator costume makes your day, you'll love the Spanish Steps. And if you can't wait to compare Rome's Hard Rock Cafe with the one back home, there's one on Via Veneto. On the Corso, you can even cruise all the same designer shops you know and love and discover that the exchange rate makes their prices even that much more expensive. Soak it all in over a \"tourist menu\" lunch at any one of the interchangeable cafes. Me? I'll be over in the Ghetto or Trastevere with the Romans. The breakfast buffet looked lovely but at 30E per person (that's $45 each), I wasn't buying. Drinks on the roof terrace were lovely but similarly priced. My daughter's pineapple juice was 8E ($12). At least was it fresh. Finally, when you want help from the concierge be prepared to wait, in person. During our visit, there was always a small crowd in front of the desk. If I called from our room, I got continuous busy signals. Summary: If you want charm, character, and an authentic immersion in Rome, stay elsewhere. (I recommend Hotel Campo Di'Fiore.)

Beautiful hotel located right by the Spanish steps. This is definitely the high-end part of Rome with many other glamorous hotels and shopping areas located nearby. If I were to do it again, I probably would get something a little further south (near the Piazza Navonna, Pantheon, Coliseum, etc.) as this is where we spent most of our time. Not terrible, but it probably added 20 minutes to our walking time each way -- though perhaps not a bad way to burn off all of the calories from the pasta and gelato. The hotel was very nice. Rooms were reasonable. The bathroom was nice with Hermes toiletries. This hotel actually had excellent service. All of the staff were very friendly and spoke excellent English. One night my wife asked if there was a pharmacy nearby because she needed some medicine for the blisters we got, and they actually gave us some out for free. On another occasion, I asked for a wake-up call for an early flight. About 45 minutes after the call, I got a reminder call to ask if everything was OK and to let me know my taxi would be ready in a few minutes -- this was a pleasant surprise. They also exchanged $$$ for Euro at a rate that wasn't terrible compared to most places I found in the city. Not sure why the hotel only gets 4 stars. We stopped by the Eden for drinks and the Hassler for dinner, and I think the Sofitel was comparable. Perhaps the lobby wasn't as grand as some others. But all in all, I think a pretty nice place. The price was a bit expensive at 400 Euro / night, but I think that is typical for Europe. When in Rome make sure to hit Caffe Greco (by the Spanish steps) and Caffe San Eustachio (Pantheon) for coffee as well as Giolitti and Della Palma (just north of the Pantheon) for gelato.

I ordered a birthday cake for dessert in the restaurant; a friend sent a bottle of prosecco to our room., but the hotel ignored it. I was in Hong Kong for my sister's 40th and the hotel gave her a bottle and cake. I just assumed that the Sofitel would be as attentive, especially as we are in their loyalty scheme. And there was a complicated way of getting wifi.

Situated 400 metres from the Spanish Steps in a quieter part of Rome - and this is a good thing, as Rome can be full-on, manic and very tiring. The Hotel is expensive, but very glamorous: while when we were visiting it had a fantastic exhibition of Patrizia Savarese art in the lobby. A real treat. The staff were extremely helpful and polite throughout, arranging guides etc for the excursions we wanted to take (Vatican etc). Our room (314) was very tastefully done, had Hermes accessories in the bathroom and was well appointed. The bed was huge, easily 7 feet wide, and as comfortable as it is possible to get. Luxury. Room could have done with a kettle and coffee ( I always say that, everywhere I go) but overall, we loved the room. The one negative, and for us it was a biggie, was that we had booked for dinner on our arrival, for our last evening, in the Hotels Terrace restaurant (which had a magnificent view). We'd asked specifically to be outside, on the terrace, as the dinner was for our 'silver wedding anniversary' and we felt it would be more 'romantic'. 7.30pm was our preferred time. Arriving at the restaurant at 7.25pm we were told that a Japanese party of about 15 had checked in that day and that they had booked for a party/get together, on the terrace: So we now had to wait until they had finished around 8.30 ish. Abruptly, we were TOLD that someone had rang our room at 4pm that day, but that we weren't in so it was our fault for not being updated.

When I made a comment about how wonderful our room was, the man who showed us to it said something to the effect of \"ma'am, please, this is the Sofitel!\" as if he could not fathom my surprise! But then, on our third day, I made the mistake of leaving out a pair of earrings on the desk. They were not even remotely expensive but they were one-of-kind and had extreme sentimental value to me. Upon our return to the room that afternoon I made a beeline to the desk and they were indeed gone. I looked high and low and told myself that of course I could be crazy and perhaps I had misplaced them. But my husband had confirmed that he too had see the earrings out before we left and thought about putting them in the safe and had gotten distracted. And we were even leaving the cleaning staff monetary tips every day! Suffice it to say I was heartbroken but my husband has worked in the hotel business before and told me that it was basically my word against the staff's and that I had no recourse even if I did complain. I decided to let it go and chalk it up to my own stupidity for leaving them out in the first place. But then, after checking out from the hotel and returning home to America after continuing our tour in southern Italy, my husband discovered that the Sofitel had charged his credit card TWICE for our stay - once at the beginning when we checked in, and once at the end when we left. They had both posted to his account and were not holds. My husband called and was given the run-around by every single person he spoke to and was basically told he was lying and that they did not double charge and that he had to prove it. He is now going through his bank to have them deal with the Sofitel and get our money back. I am outraged that a hotel that counts itself as being a luxury establishment, would treat its patrons so poorly once they had departed. The rates here are not cheap and it's a large amount of money that we are still in the process of getting returned to us.

We arrived on New Year's Eve and stayed 4 nights. The first impression was of a traditional, grand yet modern, and attractive hotel. Despite being part of a chain, the hotel combined individual service, Roman style and, almost always, friendly efficiency. The hotel is ideally located to the north of the City Centre, just off the Via Veneto (which we soon realised is rather overpriced and touristy compared to the rest of the city). It's also just next to the Villa Borghese park. You can walk easily around the city from the hotel, and you are about ten minutes away from a metro stop. The building is lovely, a wedge shaped late 19th century former apartment block, and the lobby and staircase are lovely and classically decorated. The Christmas decorations were tasteful and very artistic, it's clear that the hotel management go to great lengths to get the look and feel of the hotel right. I would say the average clientele are fashionable and cultured thirtysomething European couples, yet the hotel isn't that expensive despite being in such a prime location. It's also quite unpretentious, and the service is personal and excellent. We asked the concierge to organise a restaurant on New Year's Eve, and over the course of several email exchanged prior to our arrival he booked is into a local, traditional restaurant. He also gave us excellent recommendations for the nights we were in the hotel, as well as advice about what sites to visit. I suppose this is pretty much what you would expect from a 5* hotel, but the phrase 'nothing was too much trouble' is appropriate. The room was well equipped, with a lovely bathroom, classical decor and a huge and comfortable bed. There are no real negatives, on New Year's Eve itself, the hotel wanted to charge us 60 Euros each to go onto their roof terrace to watch the fireworks- the roof terrace is awesome and has a panaromic view of Rome. We thought this was a bit much, given we were guests of the hotel, but as every seasoned traveller knows, all hotels will seek to maximise their revenue on special occasions and public holidays. However, the organisation of this was chaotic, and they forgot to offer the champagne and canapes promised. They did, however, quickly agree to forget about this cover charge. On another occasion the terrace was booked for a private function, and rather than turning us away the barman gave us free drinks in apology for the fact we couldn't go onto the terrace, not that we wanted to on a January night, we were more than happy on the comfy sofas, I think this attitude sums up what the staff are like here, they will do their utmost to make you, their guests, happy. I think we'd definitely consider this hotel again if we were returning to Rome, and perhaps we would consider another Sofitel if this hotel is representative of their brand.

The location is great, walking distance to Spanish stairs, Villa Borghese, historic center and more. The bathroom had a bathtub, not curtain, but a glass protection. This was the only thing that did not meet the quality standard. The protection was not insulated properly and water was leaking down to the bathroom floor from the shower. This had two effects: 1. The outside wood of the bathtub got rotten and developed mould and 2. the bathroom floor was flooded every time you took a shower - no matter how careful you were.

Beside looking for location I also wanted a 5 star hotel (which I thought would at least guarantee that the hotel would be compatable with a North American 4 star - which was true). I also wanted comfortable beds since the last hotel I stayed in Rome while lovely had very uncomfortable beds. I found it all at the Sofitel Roma Villa Borghese. The location was great, just a few blocks away from the Spanish Steps, we were able to walk comfortably to the Pantheon and the Trevi Fountain. We took a taxi to the Forum/Coliseum but ended up walking back. The hotel rooms were large including the bathroom, we had two rooms one standard for two people and a superior for three people. The beds were very comfortable. The rooms that we stayed in did not have alot of natural light but didn't matter much because we were only in the rooms at night. Breakfast was fine, lots of choice. The rooftop restaurant/bar had just been renovated and was beautiful. We had drinks two nights and ate dinner there one night. There were some minor service issues at the restautant but probably because it had just reopened and seemed to have new staff. We enjoyed the view but dinner was extremelyy expensive but we splurged.

Firstly from the airport (Fiumincino) it is quite far out and I would NOT recommend taking the train and metro as we did which took 2 hours and a lot of effort...it is better to just take a shuttle for about 35 euros for 2 people from the airport (train is 14 euros per person and metro 1 euro). The hotel was breathtaking on arrival and we were greeted with amazing service. We were given a map and all the sights explained, restaurants recommended and a card with the address of the hotel. It is located in a quiet road near Via Veneto (an area of expensive restaurants) with sights such as the Trevi fountain and Spanish steps nearby. The room is lovely, smells gorgeous and has all needs met including little things like toiletries, shower caps, hair dryer etc and also every evening we were given delicious little chocolates. The bed is huge and so so comfy!! The terrace bar on the roof has a gorgeous view but be warned it is pricey with 2 drinks costing 20-30 euros. In Rome everything is pretty pricey we found. The sights can all be done by walking to them using the map. I would recommend a tour for colosseum+palatine hill (20 euros per person inc admission fee), tour of vatican city (35/40 euros per person inc admission fee), seeing the trevi fountain by day and night, relaxing with a drink in the piazza navona or pantheon, and generally walking around. Food places I recommend are MoMo restaurant in Trastevere - brilliant pizzas and yummy desserts and very good prices, Gusto in Piazza Augusto - again great pizzas and lasagna and San Crispino ice cream place near trevi fountain.

I'll give you a few examples, the cab ride from the train station meter stated 13 Euros when paying was told 23 euros, at dinner everytime there were items at prices that were not posted on the menu, ie; my son ordered a Coke and they charged us 10 Euros for it and when I was reccomended a dish from the menu by the waiter they tried to charge me for the most expensive dish that I never had. It was so bad in the cities that I vowed to never visit a major city in Italy again which is a real shame as the natural beauty and history is amazing. The people really ruined a great trip due to greed.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cA very nice hotel near the Via Venito\u201d", "Author": "jawjahboy Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR81535625", "Content": "We had a nice, quiet, clean room.

If you prefer taxi rides, those are relatively cheap from this location(max 11 euros) to any major attraction. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Analisa and Rosanna helped us with reservations to dinners. Mario and Luigi at the front door were always helpful. Our room was on the small side in US terms, but reasonable in European standards. The beds were clean and the room was refreshed in the evening. The one problem in the room was the bathroom. While the bathroom was clean, one of the wood panels was rotten and hollow. Some flying bugs were coming out of it. Not good. The hotel staff did take care of the problem promptly, but they sprayed the room with some foul odor that had to be vented out. I would expect such problems to be taken care of way ahead of guests' complaints. So, that was the only bad mark to all the other good marks for the hotel.

Hotel Strengths: Fairly priced, attractive interior, clean rooms, comfortable beds, good location (Spanish Steps), very insightful and pleasant staff, free internet in business center, rooftop bar Hotel Weaknesses: Located at top of steep hill, no free wifi (that said, free wifi is tough to find in Rome) Other hotels to consider: St. George Roma, Exedra, Hotel Raphael, Grand Hotel de la Minerve Comments: My wife and I had a positive experience at the Sofitel. Based on simply observing the outside of hotels in Rome, most appear small and in need of upgrades. While not 5 stars by U.S. standards, the Sofitel is a full service hotel that is likely more luxurious that most Rome hotels. The prices were competitive at ~225 euros/night for a deluxe room (in late July). The staff was extremely pleasant, helpful and could hold a conversation in English. They were also helpful in providing tips on how to beat the crowds, providing restaurant and shopping recommendations, travel tips, and also in suggesting locals-focused entertainment. The hotel also has an attractive, but overpriced rooftop bar. The Sofitel is located a few blocks north of the Spanish Steps. The Spanish Steps are a popular tourist site and near high-end shopping. It is a short taxi ride from many other tourist sites and near public transportation. The hotel specifically is located at the top of a hill though and it can be quite exhausting to climb the hill after a long day. We found ourselves taking a taxi back to the hotel every time after our initial trek up the hill. A comparable priced hotel with similar amenities located near the Pantheon or Piazza Navona, the center of the most popular tourist attractions and a flat area, would probably be a better choice, but overall you can\u2019t go wrong with the Sofitel. Quick Rome Highlights: Sightseeing \u2013 1) Vatican Museums and St. Peter\u2019s Basilica (Reserve a tour, will save you hours of waiting in line and is insightful), 2) Pantheon, 3) Trevi Fountain, 4) Colosseum.

We arrived early in the morning and they had the rooms available. We received a wonderful friendly greeting from the front desk. They gave us maps and were helpful with directions, to book tours, etc. We had two rooms and they were lovely-spacious, clean, and quiet. Sofitel Roma is located off a quiet side street, near Villla Borghese, 5 minutes to Spanish Steps, and close to Via Veneto. It had a lovely lobby, soothing music, plenty of places to sit with a drink, read, or catch up with others. We slept with the windows open-it was pretty quiet until I heard some church bells and birds singing. The beds were comfortable, windows were double-glazed, bathroom was great (except tub was a little deep, bit tricky to get out of). We had breakfast twice - great quality, choice, staff serving very professional and friendly. We had a package deal (for families: pay for one room, second is half-off, and children eat breakfast for free) Upon leaving Sofitel, we rented a car at Europcar (through Auto Europe)-great experience too) and it is only a block away and easy exit out of Rome. But the highlight of the Sofitel, for me, as well as my children, was the kindness and friendliness of Ezio (doorman) and Luigi (Bellman, I guess) Loved seeing their smiling faces in the morning and Ezio always had a couple of tips for us on how to do Rome well - (what bus to take, trick to avoid lines at a sight, etc.) When my children were talking about what they liked best about our trip to Italy, these were the things that made the list: hiking up Mt. Vesuvius, gondola ride in Venice, St. Peter's Basilica, and EZIO! Believe it or not.

The hotel is on a quiet street off Via Veneto and about 5 minutes walk (downhill) to the top of the Spanish Steps. The public areas of the hotel are top quality and the staff are all attentive, helpful and friendly. We were greeted at the hotel by the staff who had obvbiously been made aware on the booking that this was our honeymoon and they offered congratulations. There was a card and bottle of Prosecco waiting for us in our room from the manager which was a lovely touch. Our room was on the 5th floor overlooking the Borghese Gardens and was furnished to a high standard. The only criticism of the room is that there were no tea and coffee making facilities. On arrival there was a small bottle of water in the room, but this was never replaced after the first day. Toiletries were also not replaced during our stay, but as they hadn't run out this wasn't really a problem - it just seemed unusual that a 5* hotel wouldn't replace any used items daily. The bar and restaurant are fiercely expensive but this is to be expected of an establishment such as this in Rome. We ordered room service one night and the presentation and food were very good, although not worth the high price tag! Breakfast was a continental and \"American\" buffet. The choice was good but at 32 euro per person it was hugely overpriced. Luckily, we had booked a package including breakfast otherwise we would have eaten somewhere else! There is a room where guests are able to use the internet free for 1 hour each day - a code must be obtained from reception. This was very convenient and another nice touch. The only reason I have given the hotel 4 out of 5 is that the roof terrace was closed during our stay (and will be until late April). I had read a previous TA review hinting at this and emailed the hotel for confirmation. I never received a reply. There was a sign in the hotel lift informing of the closure which was very disappointing. The terrace had been one of the reasons we chose to book Sofitel so felt a bit cheated. Overall the hotel is a classy establishment on the outskirts of the city.

My wife had reserved a room at a four star hotel that was a bit further away from Via Veneto. It was Christmas, I wanted us to stay at a nice place - so I canceled the hotel my wife booked and made a reservation at the Sofitel. I am familiar with Sofitel and Novotel Hotels, I thought this would be a real treat for my wife. What a mistake that turned out to be! The check-in was great, people were very friendly and we were shown to our room. The room we stayed was decorated nicely, and had a balcony with a nice view. But I am someone who spends numerous nights a year at luxury hotels, including Sofitel hotels - I immediately noticed what was missing at this hotel. No wireless connection in the room, no iron, no teapot so that you can boil water. I thought it was ridiculous that a five star hotel did not have any gym! Breakfast cost somewhere along the line of 30 Euro. We had Hermes toiletries in our room which was replaced by some cheaper alternatives on the second day. The highlight of stay (?) came about the last night of our four night stay. We asked the concirege to recommend a good Italian restaurant to have our last dinner in Rome. The friendly concierge made reservation at a restaurant near Novena Square and wrote down the address on a piece of paper for us. When our taxe dropped us off at a dark deserted alley few minutes later, we found the restaurant to be CLOSED! There we were, standing the dark with our two year old on a stroller. I used my roaming cell phone to call the hotel. The concierge said to me, \"sorry about that. But there are many restaurants nearby, we should be able to find one that you like\" Frankly, I was taken aback by his response. Luckily we ended up at a great local place called Monte Carlo which saved the night. Just when my wife and reached the conclusion that hotels in Italy were probably similar to what we had just experienced, the next hotel we checked in in Florence changed that impression. Four star, but absolutely superb in what amenities that had, how we were treated, etc. But that is another review. We are not budget travellers. Among many hotels that I have stayed at, Sofitel Rome was by far the worst value I have ever experienced in a five star hotel - I thought they were so keen on making the next dollar (or euro) that they lost touch totally on how to serve customers well. Sofitel Luxembourg is one of my favourite hotels; not cheap, but they deliver. They lset us use the minibar for free, replenished it daily, and discounted our breakfasts as we were hotel guests. We felt valued. After getting used to high quality service at Starwood, Marriott and even at other Accor hotels, I thought Sofitel would compare with a Park Hyatt or a St. Regis. This visit changed that perception. I will not stay at a another Accor (Sofitel's parent group) hotel as a protest, and will encourage my colleagues to stay somewhere wwhen they travel. When I spend the money at stay at a luxury hotel, I want to feel \"spolied\", not feel that I am getting ripped off at every turn I make!

After a long day of site seeing it'd be nice to take a shower and not have to worry about water pouring all over the floors. We solved the problem by putting 2 or 3 towels right outside the shower to sop up most of the water that leaks out from under the partition because of faulty seals and around it b/c the partition is so small. The leaking shower also lead to quite a bit of mildew/mold in the shower area...

Room was spacious, containing a king size bed, sitting area, desk, and large bathroom. Hotel is two-three city blocks from the top of the Spanish Steps, across the street from Villa Borghese (Rome's largest park), and the Spagna metro stop. Highly recommended for a traveler who wants a hotel that is in a quiet, but convenient, location. We'd rate the hotel 5/5 and would happily return if we went back to Rome. Location Great location on a side street, which is both quiet and safe. If you turn left out of the hotel you can walk to the Spagna metro and the Spanish Steps, if you turn right, there is a shopping mall that also has a small grocery store inside. Highly recommended for the location alone, as the hotel is near everything you need while in Rome. 45 minutes away from the Leonardo Da Vinci Fiumicino Airport. A cab from the hotel costs 45 euro. Note - while we took a shuttle from the airport, the \"meeting point\" in the FCO airport is a mess. If we did it again, we'd skip the shuttle and take a cab, it's well worth it. Room Very spacious and comfortable room. Bed was up to the Sofitel standard, which is to say extremely comfortable. Turndown service at night. Service Everyone was very nice, courteous, and helpful. Almost everyone spoke English. Restaurant Didn't use it. Notes We really enjoyed all of the gelaterias Rome had to offer and visited six - Giolotti, Gelateria del Teatro, Della Parma, San Crispino, and a few others. While it's close, Giolotti was the best. Their servings are the biggest, they give you panna (whipped cream) if you so desire, and the range of flavors is more than sufficient (though not up to the Della Parma standard). Giolotti is a 10-15 walk from the hotel.", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, Dc/Moscow,Russia", "Title": "\u201cIn the end game...\u201d", "Author": "Maximilliano", "ReviewID": "UR37859485", "Content": "Stayed here in Feb 2006...

I was on my honeymoon and, having written to the hotel in advance, they offered various services. One of these to book us two tickets to the opera at slightly lower than the usual rate for Stalls seats - which we used, and it was great. I asked for flowers which they forgot, but was not annoyed as we were earlier arriving than we should've been - and they gave us a free bottle of Prosecco instead. The staff, such as a very nice concierge called Ludovic (I think) were all great and very keen to be of service. The bed was massive and so absurdly soft it was a bit like sleeping on a cloud, though I think our room was upgraded a bit due to the honeymoon email. They also have a catalogue trying to sell these special beds to you! On the negative side, the food etc. was very expensive - and some/all of the rooftop terrace was booked a couple of times for functions, which unfortunately coincided with when we wanted to use it. However, Rome can be quite expensive (sometimes 5 or 6 Euros for a Diet Coke!) and you can book terrace tables when they're not being used for functions, we just didn't bother. I did not understand the complaints in this site about the air conditioning, as we thought it provided a very chilled and welcome relief from the baking 30-40 degree celcius Rome heat - perhaps it made a slight churny sound, but barely noticeable to us. Overall I would recommend this hotel, especially if you can afford to splash the cash - but even if on a budget as we were, the pleasant staff, great location and luxurious comfort make it a great option.

The hotel is absolutely first-class, especially by European standards that we have presumed by using Tripadvisor. We have always felt extremely safe and comfortable staying there with our daughter (6 months on the first trip, 10 months on the second). Its location is ideal- on a very quiet and safe street near Villa Borghese but also within walking distance from everything else you go to Rome to see! Our rooms were very spacious (the room in January was actually big) with extremely comfortable beds under plush white linens, a chaise, table and chairs, desk, TV with internet access, refrigerator, hidden safe, plenty of storage, central heat/air, and luxurious draperies on large, fully opening windows. The staff may be the best asset of this hotel- extremely friendly and helpful with any need you have. The front desk called several local restaurants searching for one serving osso bucco for my husband, they delivered and set up our baby bed complete with a toiletry/slipper package for our daughter, and they arranged a private car from the hotel for our 5 AM trip to the airport to return home- less expensive than a taxi! The Sofitel feels like our home in Rome, and it is because of these very special people whose faces are like those of old friends. You cannot imagine how wonderful and loved we felt when we returned in January and Ezio recognized us (from our October trip) through the window of the taxicab and quickly opened the door, greeted us warmly, and took our baby girl in his arms! He was genuinely happy to see us again, as we were him. He was an instrumental part of BOTH of our visits to Rome with his perfect directions, travel tips, tourist hints, and locations we needed; on a particularly gray January day he even insisted we take his umbrella out with us. We hope to see him many more times- he is the best! This hotel is a beautiful place, inside and out, from the decorations on the walls to the hearts of its employees. Do not miss this wonderful place! If you are looking for a place to retreat and relax after an amazing and fascinating day exploring Rome, do not miss the Sofitel and its rooftop bar.

I agree it is slightly away from the main attractions so you do need very comfortable shoes but its a 10 min walk from the Spanish Steps and we found most attractions easily accessible from here. Tips for your Visit: 1. Comfortable shoes a must - metro doesn't bring you out right on top of alot of the star attractions but we found by walking you stumble upon hidden secrets (i.e. fountains and piazzas). 2. Do not book the vatican tour through the hotel - waste of money - the guide was more interested in rushing us through the vatican museums to the sistine chapel then letting us look around on our own for 20 mins with no real information from him then constantly reminding us that St Peters is the biggest church in the world. If you want a tour guide get one outside -they tend to be students/ scholars of art/ history who know a lot more! 3. If landing at Ciampino - do not use the Terravision coach - 12 euros return seems a bargain but not with the 1.5 hour wait first then its a fair walk to this hotel as it drops you off at Termini Station. Pay the 30 euros each way between the airport and your hotel. 4. As you can expect, food and drink near the attractions is expensive - if your trying to save money look a little further away first. 5.

However, the map of Rome that we had did not show that you cannot get to the street we wanted without climbing the Spanish Steps, which we were not about to do. So we had to go about 7 blocks (at least 4 straight uphill) to reach the hotel. As we made it up to the front door, a lovely doorman come rushing to our rescue. Luigi quickly took our bags, found chairs for the kids, and directed us to the front desk. He even fanned me off with my map. We were hooked from that point on. The rooms were beautiful and large which was a pleasant surprise. Great bathrooms and Hermes toiletries (great shampooo). It is also very quiet at night - we did not even know anyone else was in the hotel. The crowning glory of the hotel, however, has got to be the Terrace. On the top floor is an open terrace with couches and bar tables that overlooks the entire city. It is breathtaking. They have an extensive drink menu and serve appetizers, entrees and desserts. There is even a telescope if you want a better view. I was impressed with every aspect of the hotel and will hopefully have the chance to return.", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Fl", "Title": "\u201cGreat Rooftop Bar\u201d", "Author": "bajathree", "ReviewID": "UR17762739", "Content": "We were a family of 4 with 2 rooms booked through their web site using the book 3 nights and get the 4th free including a picnic lunch.

Neighborhood restaurants not on Via Veneto were good and moderatelly priced. Just around the corner Marcello's/Vladimir's provided us a three course dinner with wine for little more than the hotel breakfast charge. Aurora 10 had great seafood, and Chiacchiere, 1.5 blocks the other side of Via Veneto on Via Sicilia was nice for an outdoor cafe lunch as well as dinner. A one foot strip at the edge of our king size mattress in Room 505 was lumpy and saggy, reducing the useable size of the bed to queen size. For a hotel of this overall quality the mattress should long since have been replaced. While the hotel did make a nice refuge from sightseeing, it is somewhat far afield from a number of sites, and while we walked 8 to 10 miles a day, we did need 3 or 4 cab rides a day at never less than 9 to 10 euros each.

A tip for getting around is to use the buses as well as metro. The 116 circular minibus terminus is on the street next to the Sofitel. It will take you all over, it winds through the city centre small streets with ease and runs about every 5-10 mins.

My girlfriend and I planned a Romantic break in Rome and used TripAvdvisor (once again) to choose our hotel. Based on the reviews of the hotel and their TripAdvisor award we settled on the Sofitel. We made our booking by telephone through Hotels.com in less than 5 minutes. We booked a Deluxe Double room for 3 nights (Friday 22nd February to Monday 25th February). The hotel is located near Villa Borghese in non-touristy and quieter part of Rome (no offence to other hotels or areas - that\u2019s just my opinion having stayed in Rome several times before). To place it in perspective, its only a relatively short walk from the Spanish Steps (yes, a little uphill on the way back - but not a problem) and close enough to the Trevi Fountain to make it a comfortable walk. It is located on the corner of a really quiet, peaceful and safe street. From the outside it does not necessarily appear that impressive looking (sometimes a positive sign of understated quality!!!)... but (and this is a big but) the service and quality strike you from the moment you approach the hotel or get out of your taxi. The caped doorman is ready at hand to offer a smiling welcome and take your luggage. The bellboys immediately step in to take your luggage and guide you to reception. The reception staff are very professional, well spoken, well dressed and very, very helpful with the whole process. Maps and tourist information were presented without asking and we were advised that taxis can be booked from reception or the or the doorman at a moments notice. It is clear that this hotel has a clear standard and level of service, worthy of its star rating. Although our room was not immediately ready on checking-in, we received a profuse apology but we were assured that the Deluxe Double room we booked was worth the wait - and Yes, they were absolutely right. The room (519) was tastefully decorated, with a seating/lobby area, room safe in the wardrobe, large bathroom and a HUGE (and I mean HUGE) bed - you could easily fit 3-4 people in it. A word of advice - don't lie down on the bed straight away... its that soft and comfortable you may not get out of it again... I'm not joking!!! Sometimes I find it difficult to settle into a hotel bed for the first night or two... the only two exceptions are the Renaissance River Hotel in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam and, now, the Sofitel Roma. There is hardly any traffic passing and little if any noise from the road outside. Our room had two little balcony's to look out from... a nice touch. The hotel has a nice lobby and bar area where you can relax after a hard days sightseeing. Most importantly... the staff are very professional, discreet and stay in the background, but are there when you need them. The 7th floor has a wonderful terrace with great views of the city by day and night, and is worth the visit even if you are not staying in the hotel. We booked a walking tour of Rome with a company called EnjoyRome.com, when we asked the doorman to order a taxi he immediately knew that we were taking a tour and instructed the taxi driver exactly where to drop us off, saving us some time wandering around looking for the tour pick-up point. On our last day we planned some sightseeing and asked if the hotel could hold our luggage for a few hours. This was no problem and the staff seemed happy to help out. Five little tips. 1) Book some walking tours with EnjoyRome.com. In total we took 3 walking tours of Rome with Enjoy Rome, all lasting 3 hours long.. The old city/Jewish quarter tour is particularly good both for the sites and as an introduction to Rome. They also do the Vatican and the Major Sites. We would strongly recommend these tours as they helped orientate us to the city and sights. These tours also gave us a good idea of how easy it is to walk to/around the major sites - so take our advice and make the most of your time using an organised tour. 2) if you are English or Irish and are absolutely gasping for a cup of decent tea then try the Babbington/Barrington Tea house at the bottom of the Spanish Steps (left hand side), yes its a little bit expensive... but when the need for tea calls this will really hit the spot. 3) For an authentic family run trattoria with local atmosphere and genuine Italian food try Mario' on Via del Moro (near Piazza Trilussa) you will not be disappointed with the food or the prices. Try the Meatballs or the Sausage (I did both!) The young waiter is very happy to use/learn English (he even gave us a free pen!!!) and it has a really nice local and genuine feel to it. Friday or Saturday are probably best for a real experience. Leave your diet outside. 4) For real pizza in a lively and genuine atmosphere try Dar Poeta on Vicolo del Bologna (near Piazza Trilussa), be warned... the Italian starter is HUGE (meats, cheese, olives, etc) so have plenty of room for your main course. Needless to say the piazza is excellent and well helped by the house wine. You might have to queue for a few minutes, but it is really worth the wait! A good mix of locals and tourists mean that it is really lively and buzzing. Again, leave your diet outside. 5) Even on weekend trip - get out of the city for a while. A trip to Chianti (yes, where the wine comes from) is only 30 minutes by train. A lovely little town with a nice square, wonderful ice cream and delicious cakes. A nice walk in the park below the towering main house on the hill followed by a coffee will round things off nicely. In closing, one of the most welcoming notions while on holiday is the prospect of returning to your warm, welcoming and comfortable hotel after a hard days sightseeing, shopping or a night out. We would therefore strongly recommend the Sofitel Roma to couples, families and older people if you want to treat yourself to a non-touristy (sorry to use that term but mass tourism hotels do not really appeal), quality, relaxing, comfortable and memorable stay in Rome. After this experience we intend to return to Rome and will definitely be staying at the Sofitel again.", "Date": "March 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "hampshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel but a little out of town\u201d", "Author": "jandg20", "ReviewID": "UR14120676", "Content": "We stayed in the Sofitel for one week.

After reading all the reviews here and in some of the guidebooks, I finally settled on the Sofitel despite my reservations and previous mixed experience w. the US chain: the Sofitel in Philly is superb. The one in Chicago was terrible. So, imagine my relief upon arriving here. The doorman was quick to grab our bags but that's the kind of service I was expecting. Our rooms were ready before the normal check in time. They gave us a corner room on the 2nd floor and my parents a room down the hall. Ours was definitely nicer and larger although theirs was just fine. The decor is a bit \"ROMAN\" aka chintzy, and the rooms are a bit dark due to the heavy curtains, but the bed--just a classic double--was king sized and super comfortable. The marble bathroom was incredibly spacious, with a full bath and powerful showerhead. The robes were kind of thin and rough. Amenities were great (except no lotion--is that strange?) and everything was very clean and the hotel offered turn down service and a 2nd clean up each night. Staff was accomodating, friendly and prompt--helping to arrange taxi service, always prompt w/ wake up calls, quick to bring up a toothbrush, etc. We loved to retire to the lobby library lounge after dinner for drinks. I had a cold for most of the trip and one day the bartender offered to make me a hot toddy of milk, brandy and honey---it did WONDERS for my chest cold. We did not bother w/ the hotel breakfast...instead walking down the Via Veneto to Cafe Paris and having coffee, frenchly squeezed orange juice and chocolate filled brioches while standing at the coffee bar--just like the locals. $15 euro for 4 people, as opposed to $25 euro per person for the sofitel breakfast buffet. The terrace on the 7th floor offers a great view. You can pick up some vino and toast to the fabulous city up there. The location is great because it's near to the Spanish steps, across from the Borghese gardens and yet quiet during the night. There is a great gourmet shop just down the street that serves fantastic lunch. Note: the nearest Metro is a bit of a hike so if you don't like walking, this may be an issue. I would definitely stay here again--perhaps asking for a room on one of the higher floors.

This room was smaller than the first one but had a balcony that you could walk out onto and sit on except there were no chairs available. One complimentary bottle of water was included on the first day only. As a chain hotel there were the typical nice amenities offered in the bathroom (e.g. Roger & Gallet toiletries and even toothbrushes and toothpaste, comb, vanity and sewing kits, etc.). There were shower/tub combination in both rooms. However, there were two showers-one normal but not adjustable handspray and an enormous rainshower). The irksome thing was that the normal shower was not adjustable so it risked spraying the floor if you weren't careful. The rainshower was not as strong as the handspray so it was either you used one or the other, perhaps both if you wanted. The hairdryer was also irritating as it was tiny, had a short cord, and had one setting and temperature (high).

We arrived on a Sunday afternoon after driving in from Tuscany. Rome is a little difficult to navigate by car so we were happy that the Hertz drop-off was only a couple of blocks away. We pulled up, and were met by two bellman who quickly took care of our bags. Michael at the front desk made check-in a breeze, and also made three local restaurant recommendations that were excellent (more on that later). The hotel lobby, and common areas are immaculate. Our room #209 on the 2nd. floor corner had three exposures: facing the front of the hotel (Via Lombardia), two facing the busy (Via di Porta Pinciana). Although facing that busy side street (cars, scooters, tour buses), the double pane windows kept things quiet. The room itself was elaborately decorated with nice furniture (desk, armoire, fully stocked mini-fridge, tv), and three levels of window treatments. Twin beds (pushed together) and pillows were good. The bathroom was large, all amenities (bathrobes, soaps, combs, lotions etc.) and a nice rain shower. The buffet breakfast (european style) included was good, and can be had either in the restuarant on the lower level, or sent via room service (at no extra charge). Room service was the quickest I ever experienced. Much faster than many of the true five star properties I've stayed at. Imagine, the room service operator was apologizing because it may take 5 minutes!! Nice! The hotel is in a great location in my opinion. Two blocks from the Via Veneto (cafe's, restaurants (Hard Rock Cafe, The famous Harry's Bar, shopping). And within walking distance of all of the major sites (some closer than others) albeit a long walk to others. We were blessed with great weather our whole trip so we laced up our sneakers, and walked virtually around the whole city. **Reviewer Recommendation** Upon arriving in Rome buy a 2 day (Open City) hop-on, hop-off double decker bus ticket. The 2 day ticket is $20Euro, and worth every dime. The approx. two hour tour covers most of the major attractions, and your'e never too far from a bus stop so if you get tired of walking you can hop back on the bus. The tour helps you get your bearings while in Rome. The \"Open City\" green bus can also be used on the \"Rome City\" buses also green. The one pass enables you to use both companies..Great deal! There are two stops relatively close to the Sofitel (two blocks away on (Via Ludovisi), and a little longer walk down the hill on the (Via Veneto). The restaurants recommended by Michael (a native New Yorker) were excellent. All within walking distance of the hotel, all very good food at very reasonable prices. First, \"il pomodorino\" (ate here twice) on the Via Campania. A modern, bright and open local jaunt. Great house red, great pizza and pasta, and the grilled steak & chicken was excellent. Also, on the Via Campania \"al vero Girarrosto Toscano\", a slightly higher priced \"old school\" more formal, italian restaurant with a open charcoal grill, and waiters in white jackets, the service was wonderful, and the food also great! Again, a nice grilled steak, two pasta's and a nice bottle of Ruffino Chianti. On our last night we went right around the corner to 'Ristorante Aurora\" we kept the \"outside\" waiter company, and sat alone at the outdoor cafe. Everyone else seemed to want to dine inside, but honestly we never even went in. This local place has great fresh fish. We dined on grilled lamb chops, salad, and a great grilled sea bass (d-boned by the waiter), oh! a bottle of red of course. Service and food was very good, and moderatley priced. I would'nt be surprised that Michael recommends these places to everyone, but in my book all great choices. On a side note, if you plan on visiting Vatican City (St. Peters, the Vatican Museum, & the Sistine Chapel), buy your tickets in advance or take the group tour. The lines when we were there were three hours long to get in. Also, freebies (no charge) are the Pantheon, Spanish Steps, St. Maria of Cosmedin (\"mouth of truth\" from the movie \"Roman Vacation\" and the Trevi Fountain. I highly recommend the Sofitel in Roma.

We stayed from September 19th through the 24th. First of all, for those that complain that rooms are too small, that is just the way it is in Rome. In this case, I found our room (#214) to be quite comfortable. Here are the pros and cons... PROS: The front desk staff, bellmen, and doormen are great. They are all quick to greet you and help you with whatever you may need. The rooms are clean with turn down service at night. You can have breakfast in the breakfast room or in your own room at no extra cost. The location of the hotel is great (once you get there). It has an unforgettable top floor terrace where you can drink wine and enjoy the spectacular view of Rome. There is also a nice bar/lounge to enjoy a late night cocktail. You are pretty close to Barbarini Square. There are several restaurants (including the Hard Rock Cafe) as well as the Metro (aka subway, tube, underground, etc) You are also close to locations such as the Spanish Steps (where I proposed to my girlfriend.....SHE SAID YES.), Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Piazza Navona etc. You are about 40 minutes walking distance to the Vatican. CONS: I mentioned that the majority of staff is nice. I cannot say this for the breakfast staff. The servers seemed to be disgruntled. I heard many complaints from other guests, although some of the guests, in my opinion, deserved the bad service. PLEASE DONT FORGET THAT YOU ARE VISITING A FOREIGN COUNTRY. YOU ARE THE GUEST AND MUST ADAPT TO THE WAY THINGS ARE IN ITALY AND NOT EXPECT EVERYTHING AS YOU WOULD BACK HOME. Continuing with the cons....the hotel is located at the top of a hill. If you plan on walking to the hotel throughout the day or just at the end of the day, expect an approximate 1/4 to 1/3 of a mile trek uphill. This is important to know if you are out of shape or have any health problems. The hotel is ABOVE AVERAGE. I have stayed in better places around the world but the Sofitel Roma definately made our stay in Rome a pleasant one. We will likely return on our next visit. The breakfast staff was what blew it for us. We would not look forward to going each morning. By the way, the food itself is pretty decent. breads (sweet and regular), salami, prosciutto, cheese, eggs (real ones but a little runny), bacon, little weiners, yogurts, cereals, fruits, juices (real juice) and the coffee is good.

The Minibar (Beer 7\u20ac) is expensive, but they got a very nice bar next to the lobby which is a lot cheaper (4,50\u20ac for a beer coming with a selection of nuts and crackers). The very nice rooftop terrasse is open till 22:00h and kind of an insider tip.

It seems that this is the rate you have to pay to get a good, clean, spacious hotelroom in Rome. The Sofitel is nicely located off the Via Veneto, a short Taxi ride from Termini (the main train station in Rome). Or a 5 minute walk from either Metro station Spagna or Barberini. It is going up hill or up the Spanish Steps from the Metro stations so the Metro is not the most comfortable way to travel if you have heavy or plenty luggage. The taxi ride should cost you less than 10 EURO. The room was facing the yard which made it very quiet though not offering the greatest view of course. It had 2 comfortable beds, the usual 4 star stuff as cable TV, minibar, safe and a big sofa. Room was clean and cosy. The Bathroom was pretty big, bright and clean, a bath tub but no separate shower cabin. Breakfast was good by Italian standards but not overwhelming: scrambled egg, sausages and ham, juices, cereals, breads and cakes, canned fruits, excellent prosciutto ham and cheeses \u2013 no fresh fruit or veggies like tomatoes though. The food I ordered to the room came in no time and was very good and reasonable priced \u2013 unlike the beer from the minibar which costs 7 EURO for a small bottle of local beer. There is a nice bar in the lobby which is opened till midnight where the drinks are much cheaper, so go there for your sun-downer or get your drink there to enjoy it on the 7th floor terrace which offers a great view of Rome! There are loads of restaurants around the area, something for every taste I suppose.

I've stayed in other places in Rome, and the quality is usually less than you get in the UK or US, but not at the Sofitel. The desk staff were friendly, helpful and unobtrusive. The door staff got to know you very quickly and helped make the place feel very safe and secure. The rooms are immaculate, with luxurious touches everywhere. The bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever had in a hotel - as the guy on reception said \"it's like a nest\". Great, clean bathroom with regular towel and toiletry top-up. In short, everything you'd expect (but don't always get) from a 4-star hotel. You're within a short walk of the Spanish Steps & its metro station (5-10 mins), though on the way back this is uphill, which might be a problem for some. 5 minutes in the other direction and you're on the Via Veneto. For me, an upmarket location in a quiet but accessible part of the city really makes a city break great. The rooms are big by Rome standards, but not enormous. The breakfast is fine - nothing great, but a convenient start to the day, with pastries, coffee, juice, a good selection of cold meat and cheese and a small hot item selection too. We didn't eat in the restaurant as there are plenty of choices nearby. Other guests didn't seem to use it, but the Sofitel takes advantage of it's hilltop location with a stunning roof terrace. Order a drink from the bar, head up in the lift enjoy a gorgeous pre-dinner half hour up there with views over St Peters and most of Rome! Chances are, you'll have it all to yourself too.

The hotel itself has a small feel to it, although the exterior facade promises more. The entry and front desk are understated to the point of being underwhelming. Only when you walk up the stairs to the right of the entrance do you start to experience the old world elegance. Our room, which I believe was a standard king, was small, but nice.

The reviews were good on trip adviser. We had booked for one night (before spending five nights on the Amalfi Coast) and then a further two nights upon our retrun to Rome before heading home via Dubai. On arrival the doormen were wonderful and check in was quick and painless. The doorman/Porter showd us to our room and gave us a few quick lessons in Italian (Very funny). Our room was very nice, large room and very well decorated, nice bathroom. We were also given our complimentary drink vouchers (another bonus of being a Sofitel member). Interesting was the fact when we went to the bar that evening to use the vouchers (that we get in every Sofitel we stay at) the waiter made us feel like we were not entitled to these drinks - to the extent he said he would have to check. (So much for being special). The bar area is very large and we were lucky to find a quieter spot as the main portionn had been taken over by some very very loud Americans - we did not revisit the bar, but frequented the restaurant down the road - cant recall the name but turn left outside the hotel and go one block and turn right and the restaurant is right on the corner. (You can actually see it from the door of the hotel if you look right). We did not get upgraded this time. Unfortunately the shower was not great the water pressure was poor and water went everywheree when I tried to wash my hair (Shower over bath). The bed was not the normal Sofitel type with the fluffy pillows and matthress's etc. Also when I sat on the bed it dropped slightly - but it was one night at this stage so we made do. Good point thought was that when we returned at night, we had been given beautiful complimentary toiletries and a gorgeous box of chocolates. We also thought when we returned we would probably get upgraded as Sofitel Members. One great thing was that as we were leaving early the next day for our Amalfi trip tour, the Hotel organised breakfast boxes for us as the breakfast dining room would not be open at this stage - nice touch, Also they kept all our luggage free of charge for the next five days, saving us taking loads of luggage we did not need to the Amalfi Coast. Upon our return five days later we were greeted with \"Welcome back Mr & Mrs Dobson\" and also our upgrade and what an upgrade it was. We were put on the 7th floor (Top Floor) In a suite with its own very large private terrace (I could have held a party for 50 friends there) table and chair and sun beds. The suite was wonderful, separate lounge, ensuite bathroom and then a huge bedroom with very large bathroom, including a separate shower with great water pressure. The beds were back to the wonderful Sofitel fluffyness and it was amazing. Went I went back down to the front desk, the staff asked was I happy with the shower (they had remembered my complaint five days earlier).

It was appointed with two twin sized beds (we were given the choice of a king); desk and chair, seating area and a quaint sliver of a balcony overlooking Via Lombardia and the aging but picturesque villa across the street. Villa Borghese is just across the adjacent Via Pinciana and the Spanish Steps a short, downhill walk. The bathroom was large and well equipped, but the tub/shower needs a better means of preventing leaking onto the floor ( a minor inconvenience). The included breakfast was taken in the basement restaurant space and was more than generous, with a variety of selections tailored to suit large and small appetites. The service was excellent as was the espresso and capuccino, which was delivered on request with a smile. For us, the bonus of our stay was the incredibly friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff at the front desk. Massimo even assisted us with a difficult purchase, which he agreed to return for us the day we left. Michael and the rest of the staff were equally helpful with museum and restaurant suggestions. ( The seafood at Aurora, around the corner, was quite good). I would agree with other contributors to try the restaurants on the side streets rather than on the Via Veneto. For orientation purposes, Sofitel is located between the Splendide and the Eden. We've stayed at the Eden before, but preferred the more intimate treatment we received at Sofitel.

Last time we had stayed in the Hotel del Corso but though the location here is great were put off by the poor breakfast and the soundproofing in the bedrooms.The Sofitel is in a different class with a five star rating in almost every category. Staff-Always friendly and helpful particulary front door staff. Room-we had a standard room which was generally excellent.The bed was very comfortable-linen sheets changed every morning/plenty of drawer and wardrobe space/ a small table and 2 chairs /good lighting for reading .The bathroom was compact and had everything you would want including Roger Gallet toiletries though the shower could have been stronger. Room cleaning was excellent. Breakfast- If you like to eat ham/cheese /cakes/eggs and bacon at breakfast you would enjoy the breakfast more than we did. There was very little fresh fruit, canned peaches and pears instead of cut up fresh and cooked fruits which are available in comparable hotels elsewhere, and the cereals were limited. My coffee and my wife's tea were often luke warm. We have been in other Sofitels and other 4 star hotels were the breakfast was much better. Hotel facilities. The one facility I want in hotel-I generally don't use room service or the bar-is a free internet facility which is available in the lobby of most comparable hotels.This Sofitel does not have this. Location. It's a ten minute walk from the Spanish steps and up hill on the way back.This may put off some people.It wasn't a big problem for us even in the high temperatures of last week. We would recommend 2 local restaurants.One in the same street-Via Lombardia-on the same side as the hotel an which is not open at night.It is called Gargano's. You choose your meal inside from a wide range of vegetables /salads / ham and meats etc The price is based on weight and you eat outside.It is mostly frequented at lunch time by staff working locally-would highly recommend.Also would highly recommend Girarrosto Fiorentio off the Via Veneto on the other side of the road from the Via Lombardia. It's pricy but of a very high standard. Would also recommend highly a pizzeria -il Leoncino-in the Via del Leoncino which is opposite Via Condotti off the Via Fontanella Borghese. We had 2 piazzas,a mixed salad , a litre of water and a half litre jug of red wine for 22 euros.It is always full which is a good sign.

Long before our arrival, I have corresponded to the hotel directly to ensure that 2 non-smoking rooms on high floor and are close to each others are confirmed. They have always responded in a timely manner to every question I had. Here are a few points about the hotel: 1. LOCATION: Within short walking distance to Spanish Steps, Via Condotti, many restaurants (both expensive and inexpensive), many shops, subway...but on a quiet residential street. 2. CLEANINESS: THE BEST REASON FOR STAYING HERE. Spotless clean room, bathroom, crisp (I would disagree if someone called this hard or scratchy) sheets (a sure sign that a clean and pressed sheet was changed-some 4 stars hotel do not change the sheets often). I was shocked that the bathroom doesn't have the urine smell like some other hotels (4 and 5 stars) that I have stayed at in Europe) 3. SIZE: Nice/comfortable size of bed and bathroom for Rome. 4. DECOR: As always, the lobby and rooms are tastefully, artistically decorated with marble and paintings. 5. SERVICE: They never cease to amaze me with the attentive service: from calling taxi to handling your luggage, to the room orientation tour, to giving direction and making reservation. The front desk staff speak 3,4 languages. 6. BREAKFAST BUFFET (try to book the room with breakfast): Quite generous in selection (yogurt, fruits, cold meat such as ham and turkey, boiled egg, scamble egg, sausage, bread/croissant, juices, cereal, cheese...). The breakfast area are nice and cozy. The staff are extremely attentive without demanding tips (in fact, most people do not leave tips) OVERALL: I am amazingly surprised that this Sofitel is not on the list of 4 stars hotel in Rome although the price is of a 4 stars hotel.

The bathrooms are all marble, very beautiful and stocked with good toiletries (Roger & Gallet) and bathrobes. The hotel's service is excellent. Everybody, the girls at the reception desk as well as the porters, are extremely helpful and friendly. Also the maids are very friendly. Of course, there is a turn-down-service at night. The limo service from and to the airport was efficient albeit expensive. Breakfast (which was included in the room rate) was good, with some excellent Italian specialties (like fresh cut San Daniele ham). However, I can understand that some Americans did not like it, because the special things for Americans (scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon) were rather mediocre (maybe on purpose?). One night, we had dinner in the restaurant, which was medium-class, not bad, but not really good (e.g. tasteless truffles). However, in all directions there are hundreds of restaurants in walking distance. Very recommendable for a rustic, typical Roman meal was Tempio di Bacco (just down the street, 200 meters from the hotel) where we were served a wonderful 4-course-menu including a bottle of wine and limoncelli for 36 Euros.", "Date": "March 4, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sofitel Roma Villa Borghese", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d229019-Reviews-Sofitel_Roma_Villa_Borghese-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$274 - $2,598*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Lombardia 47</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "229019", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/bd/b4/af/hotel-facade.jpg"}}
