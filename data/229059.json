Our arrival, with a nine month old baby, was to be by ship as we were at the end of a cruise. Fearing travelling through Venice on a Vaporetto with pram, three suitcases and a baby was enough to put anyone off travelling. So with this in mind we had called ahead and arranged for collection by the hotel. And this is where it starts to go so well. Guiliano, the Concierge made all the arrangements, we were met by a driver who took us to to our water taxi and as the Hotel does not have a dedicated landing pier, the porter is there to meet you and take your luggage. It went seamlessly and took out any hassle related to haggling your fare with the water taxi, etc as these are all pre arranged by the hotel. Despite an early arrival, the room was ready for us which was superb as it was baby's time for her morning nap! The room was excellent. Furnished in a grand old style with silk wall coverings and the piece-de-resistance being the balcony with a view onto St Mark's square. Better still is the designer bathroom that would not look out of place in a modern design magazine, complete with heated flooring and power shower. The room was spacious by European standards, including flat screen TV with a selection of international as well Italian channels. The downside to this room? Bells, ringing from everywhere. The Tower, the Bascilica and the Clock Tower. And they don't all shut-up at night either. Keeping the windows shut helps but with a ban on air conditioning until May, it made for a stuffy night. Despite that, being able to stand on the balcony and hear the music being played at Quadri was worth it. Breakfast was served, not in a terrace as advertised, but in in the dinning room. Plenty of fare to be found at breakfast with very pleasant staff to help you along. But it was the front desk that makes this hotel work so well. From pre-empting your request for your room key, to addressing you by name. Staff could not be more accommodating to help us with the baby, storing the pram nearby and generally fussing over her. The staff would not allow us to dine at any of the tourist traps of Venice and were adamant that we eat only where the locals would eat. Their recommendations were worth it. This hotel deserves five stars for a level of care and attention to clients that is sadly missing from so many in the hospitality business. It has made our stay in Venice so much more special and memorable and I for one know where I will be staying next time I visit this wonderful city.

Sorry I took so long to leave a review but I have only started writing reviews on Trip Advisor and there is a few things I want to write about this hotel. (bear in mind it might have changed after a year!) The location: on St Marc Square which is great, but then Venice is so small and the transport services are so reliable that you could stay pretty much anywhere... The welcome drink: we were made to attend a welcome drink even through we just wanted to drop our bags into our room and get lost in Venice. At this \"welcome drink\" we were offered some special cocktails and bruchettas. When asked what our sons could have we were told that the free drinks were only for the 2 adults and that we would have to pay for the kids... Then within minutes of forking out 3 times the normal price for sodas for our \"not so important kids\" all sort of people turned up to sell us their \"exclusive\" excursions, their \"finest\" a la carte dining etc. So be aware if they still do it, this is not a welcome drink this is a trap! Finally the rooms: Ours was nothing like the ones on the pictures! It was small dated and decorated by a 3 year old! The blue dirty wall paper peelling off in some places, the pink carpet in a terrible state and the bed covers of suspicious colours. We overlooked the back street which was very noisy (although we did not mind that it is Venice on a week end!) and thanks god we were not on a romantic weekend as we had twin single beds! If I had booked a 2 or 3* I would have rated it great. But as a 4* and for the price it was very very poor.

The rooms, while not modern, were very nice and the bathrooms were great. We booked the lowest price rooms--but I had a view of the dome of St. Mark's. They have a small bar and a nice restaurant--can't comment because we ate elsewhere while walking around Venice. Reasonable prices for Venice. I found the lowest rate on the hotel site. Staff speaks English. You get the hard sell on tours when checking in, but no pressure. They didn't offer anything that you can't do yourself by buying a Vaporetto ticket (Venice's Metro on the water) and having a good map. I communicated with the hotel prior to our trip about arranging transfers from the port and to the airport. They arranged this for us--prompt, efficient--no issues. The transfers were less expensive than I had found anywhere else, although still outrageously expensive, but we had 7 people. Cons--the bells at St. Mark's ring every hour around the clock--whose idea was that? And the hotel has the tiniest elevator I've ever seen! Can't find my room photos--they seem to have disappeared-but all of the rooms are different. Thanks so much Juliano for your help prior to our arrival and during our stay--your help was invaluable.

On arrival we were told by reception staff that they didnt have enough rooms available due to some building work next door - consequently, as we were the last to arrive, we would have to split up and some of us would have to stay in another hotel. Although we were not very happy about this, we agreed that we would do it for the first night until rooms became available the following morning. We were told by the manager that this would be IMPOSSIBLE as they had more guests arriving the following afternoon and it wouldnt be fair to these other guests. It would appear that they were happy to split us up as they could almost guarentee that we would all meet up and eat in their restaurant anyway. The 'superior' hotel that they moved us to was the Columbia consisting of some annex rooms at the back of the main hotel, a third of the size of the rooms that we had booked, with a major heating problem - I had to go outside the room at 3:30am to cool down as the room was so hot. We did finally manage to get back to the Concordia where the manager expected us to feel extremely greatful for getting us back in - no apology or compensation were offered. I fully agree with the earlier comment regarding the 'special' deals that they offer - they are very expensive. A shame as the hotel itself is in a prime area, very central to St Marks Square.

On arrival by water bus from the airport, we had some trouble finding the hotel as St Mark's Square was flooded so we could not cross with our cases. We had to try to find an alternative route through the lanes and it took about an hour to find it. If you are planning to stay at this hotel, ensure that you have a good map of Venice and plot a route in advance in case the square is flooded. This apparently happens around 60 times a year. It flooded three times during our six days there. Not due to rain, but high tides that overfill the drains. Anyway, it was such a relief to finally arrive at the hotel. There were stairs to negotiate with no lift, but the porter met us at the door and assisted with the baggage. We were taken off to the bar for a free welcome drink, which was a nice touch. We were then shown to our room. It was not huge, but adequate. At first glance it was quite old fashioned, but it grew on us and we ended up liking it. The bathroom was modern and had a shower over the bath, toilet, bidet and wash hand basin. We had a room overlooking the street/lane below, which was really the front of the hotel. There is not an entrance on St Mark's Square. There were rooms overlooking the square, but we did not have one of those. I don't know if that would have cost extra. The breakfast was good, plenty of choice and nicely presented. Overall, the hotel was extremely clean, we had no issues regarding the cleanliness, and it was in an excellent location for exploring Venice. A couple of steps from St Marks Square, a few minutes from the Bridge of Sighs, and about a 20 minute walk to the Rialto Bridge. There were plently of restaurants, but the ones in the same street as the hotel were very expensive, so try going back a few streets for cheaper ones.

It is well worth the 95E that you will spend. As you leave the baggage claim area, simply look to the left and you will see the water taxi desk. They will direct you to a pier and the taxi will be waiting for you. It is a 10 minute walk to the dock as you exit the airport , again make a left. Follow the plastic awning until you arrive at the waters edge. Once there tell the driver that you would like to go to San Marco's square and that you are staying at the Concordia Hotel. If you are lucky, when they drop you off, you will only be 1 bridge away from the front door. All this depends on water traffic and the tides. PACKING LIGHT is a key to negotiating this city. There are 3,000 streets, 420 bridges, and 118 canals. There are no cars or bicycles allowed in the city. It's you and your legs so make sure that you and your feet are very comfortable. Once in the hotel, you will be greeted by a warm, friendly and helpful front desk and staff. Rooms facing San Marco square are an upgrade but well worth the ambiance. It was a little chilly in March but I still opened up my window up to enjoy the scents of this wonderful city. Upgrades run about $30/night. My only complaint is that the beds are as hard as are their pillows. But the rooms/bathrooms are immaculate down to the crisp, pressed white sheets on the beds. I had two different rooms. The one on the second floor was decorated in a Venetian style and had a heated bathroom floor while the one on the 3rd floor had a modern look to it with a wonderful balcony over looking the square. This one also had air conditioning for the hot summers but no heated floor. The bathrooms are all done in venetian glass tiles which are beautiful in my opinion. The free continental breakfast offers something special for everyone. It was plentiful, fresh and had many delicious choices for any palate. The wait staff was attentive to your every need. The dining room was charming with its varnished wood and mirrored trim and white pressed linen table clothes. Negotiating this city is a challenge. Even if you buy a map, be prepared to be lost most of the time. (By the way, I felt very safe walking around Venice at any time of day or night). I would strongly suggest a personal walking tour by a woman by the name of Maria Teresa Simones. She is a tour manager with the International Assn. of Tour Managers out of London but lives in Venice. She is a wealth of information. The tour is 65E/person with a minimum of 2 people and 100E if you traveling alone. That is the booking fee if you go through the front dest. If you call her privately, the cost is less. Her cell phone number is [-]. She showed us where the authentic Venetian restaurants were located which is less costly than the more popular tourist traps and the food was delicious. My favorite was the Taverna del Campiello Remer at Cannaregio 5701. The phone number is [-]. It is a real hard to find gem. Maria also helped us identify real Murano Glass items. She was very helpful in negotiating better prices for me. There are quite a few knock offs from China around. She took us to historical sites, commented on all of the architecture and she got us a great price for a gondola ride. 70E. Most rides are a minimum of 95-100E. The walking tour is 2+ hours, she is a lovely lady, and it is definitely worth every penny. If you are going to do the tour, do it first for she will save you a lot of time and $ in the long run. Tell her that Donna and Hannah from Philadelphia said hi. And oh, if you are there in the winter and forget your gloves, don't buy any in the specialty shops, there is a street vendor near the Rialto Bridge who sells the same items for an average of 30E less. If you are planning to travel by rail to other parts of Italy from Venice, and you are buying your rail ticket on line from the states, be sure that you are leaving from the San Lucia station. I found out the hard way that there are 2 Venice stations and I got stuck leaving from Maestra which wasn't hard to get to by rail, but if you have rail connections, you might miss your train. If you are ARRIVING by rail to Venice, again, get off at the San Lucia station. Once there look for the water BUS to get to downtown Venice. It's a lot cheaper 6.50E/person to take the water bus to the hotel than a personal water taxi. If you are adventurous, get off at the Rialto stop and ask for directions to the hotel. It's an 8 minute walk if you don't get lost. If you have time, and don't want to drag your luggage over numerous bridges and steps, get off at the San Marco Square stop. It will be an additional 20-30 minute water ride but it is closer and less taxing if you are just arriving and have heavy luggage. Be sure to wave your bus ticket in front of a ticket meter. If you don't validate your ticket, and they happen to check it, you will incur a 50E fine. If you are planning on visiting other islands while in Venice, the most popular ones are Murano and Burano. Murano is famous for its glass blowing. The front desk will arrange a FREE water taxi for you. If you arrange it yourself, you will pay 95E to get there. Once there you will be greeted by the staff for that particular factory. You will see a demonstration which is interesting and then escorted in one of 8 display rooms in which they hope that you will buy something. Don't feel like you have to. I didn't and they weren't too offended. The next thing you know you will be escorted to the taxi, again free of charge to the island of Burano. It's famous for it's fishing and lace. You will see a lace museum which is fascinating and then they will want to sell you some lace. I didn't buy anything there either. I did at other stores but who knows if it was hand sewn. At this point, you will be hungry and I highly suggest eating at the El Gato Negro. (The Black Cat) The Risotto is to die for and the Amaretto Tiramisu is so good, you'll want to eat two of them. Then you are on your own to get back to Venice. We took the water bus back and it cost 6.50E/person. It took an hour and 20 minutes to get back with one change of bus. Ask where to change water buses for no one will announce anything and who knows where you will end up. Or, you can get a personal water taxi from Burano back to Venice for 95E and it takes about 15-20 minutes depending on the water traffic. Remember that the hotel is there to make money so everything they do and arrange for you is at a higher price because of the kick backs. DO let them arrange your water taxi ride back to the airport however. The price is the same, they assist you with your luggage and it picks you up very close to the Concordia. Tipping the staff isn't mentioned but I did give the maids a couple of E's/day because they did do some extra things for me. I also tipped the bell hops when they carried my luggage to the water taxi for me. For all of you who like Italian designer clothes, (both male and female), handbags, belts, shoes etc. but cringe at the prices in the states, there is a designer outlet in Florence. It's a two and half hour rail ride to Florence (Firenze) but it's really a lot of fun. There are 17 designer stores there; Burburry, Armani, Armani Jeans,Gucci, Belanciaga to name a few. Some prices are more than half off of New York prices depending on the exchange rate. Once you get to the right Florence rail station, (I can't remember if it's the first or second one that is closer) you need to buy another local rail ticket to the Riagano Station. It's another 20-30 minute local train ride. Once there, go to the taxi stand and take a 5 minute taxi ride to The Mall. (3E/person) It's really just called The Mall. The taxies run about every 5 minutes back and forth. I have two daughters in their twenties and they were in heaven. It's a long day but you can sleep on the train and it was fun to spend some quality time with just them. Just remember to get your tickets from the San Lucia station, not Maestra. I'd leave on the 8AM train from Venice and I would take the 5PM or later train back to Venice from Florence. That would give you 3-4 hours to browse around the stores. I have checked the box so that you can write to me if you have any other questions about Venice.

The windows open out and you can lean out of them and watch the hustle and bustle of St. Marco Square, and enjoy as the little metal man strikes the bell. In the mornings when the square is still nearly empty, you can watch as the peddlers bring their carts out and tourists start to arrive. The only caveat is that you can get better deals on the gondola by yourself than you can from the hotel, and the Murano boat trip factory they send you to if you take the free trip will try to sell you some very pricey pieces. After the glass factory salesmen realized we weren't going to bite and pay a couple thousand dollars for their items, they finally showed us to their cheaper rooms. We bought a trinket we probably could have gotten cheaper elsewhere and left to go explore Murano, which is very charming and had inexpensive souveniers by the boatload.

I will do my best to describe the hotel, you the guest (who undoubtedly has a price already for the hotel) can determine if it a good value or not. The Concordia has a very central location, right of San Marco Square. It is swarming with activity; tourists from all over the world circulate outside like ants. It is not surprisingly very touristy at this location, and buyer beware with dinner, trinkets etc. We had great success with restaurants offering three course Menu del Dia for 15-18euro (not including drinks). The hotel is very clean, of course in an older building, but easily maintaining its elegance. The rooms were ample, the bed was unbelievably comfortable and it was surprisingly quiet. My room faced San Marco's, and I slept undisturbed. Do yourself a favor and open the windows to find wooden shutters, you can shut them first... then shut the windows; it really helps with the bells ringing every hour in the square. I didn't need the A/C in October, but it was available and in good working order. Breakfast was the standard stuff: cereals, cheese, procuttio, yogurt, fruits and bread. There is a menu for hot items. Everyone speaks English, and you will find yourself surrounded by fellow English speaking travelers. Getting to the hotel was exciting, once I let go of the cost. As a flight crew, we collectively hired a water taxi from the Motor-Pier. It dropped us off one small block from the hotel - 70euro. The water-taxis are large enough for at least 6 and all your bags (perhaps more) so there is a point when that option becomes economically feasible. I took the public transport to the train station (15euro for a 25 hour pass, bought at the front desk). That was easy enough, but the real treat was walking back to the hotel from the station. It was so quiet, no other tourists, relatively affordable restaurants and a much mellower vibe. As I got closer to San Marco, the streets were more crowded.

The hotel is an oasis of calm in the busiest part of Venice. It was great to be in the middle of the action but at so much peace. The reception was extremely helpful arranging the water taxi's and gondala rides with ease. The room was very beautiful with a partial view of St Marks (amazing as it was the last room left in the hotel) Breakfast was excellent and everything was done to make our short weekend into a fabulous holiday. Now some tips to stop disappointment. 1. The loveliest way to arrive at the hotel is by water taxi from the airport, its about \u00c2\u00a360 but really worth it, the taxis are like floating limousines and really hassle free. 2. The advertised trip to Murano IS worth it but you must buy something at the gift shop to get back (which is fair enough as the glass factories pay for the aforementioned water taxi to take you there and back), a little horse like the ones they make in front of you only costs 10 Euro and is very pretty in its own right. Ignore any hard sell (we didn't and managed to bargain down a very beautiful glass sculpture, but we love it! ) 3. All gondola and taxi trips must be prepaid to the hotel in cash so its worth having a fair amount on you. 4. The gondola ride is expensive around \u00c2\u00a3100 but very much worth it (believe me you'll kick yourself if you don't), do arrange it throught the hotel though otherwise you could get ripped off. 5. People say Venice is expensive but do try and think about how much you would spend in London for everything and it will stop you feeling that you are ripped off.

Everything was exactly as they told us and we arrived to the airport with no problems. The room and bathroom were large and well decorated. We had a room overlooking the alley (instead of St. Mark's), and although we could hear the sounds of people below, I would not consider it \"noisy\" (it was actually nice hearing the activity below us).

Having just returned from Venice, I found the hotel a fantastic base from which to explore La Serenissima. I had been to Venice a few times before, but this was my girlfriend's first time as part of my birthday present to her. Arriving by private motor launch (90 euros from the airport) at dusk was the perfect start. She audibly gasped as we entered Saint Mark's Square for the first time and saw it lit up in the late January gloom. The hotel is not on the main Piazza, but on the smaller Piazzetta Leoncini next to the Basilica and some of the rooms overlook the square from there. The entrance is on a narrow lane which runs parallel to the Piazza. A marble stairway runs up to the lobby and reception. As promised we were greeted with a complimentary drink and after 15 minutes or so were taken to our room. The room was small, but clean and decorated in the traditional Venetian manner. The view from the window was of a narrow alleyway rather than the square, but at 150 euros per night I thought it was more than adequate. The bellboy was attentive in the extreme and very courteous. Warnings of high pressure selling from the reception staff by others on this site turned out to be little more than offers of a \"free\" trip to Murano, but were declined with no more than a \"No, thank you.\" and were not followed up. After a quick change, we headed out into the cold Venetian night. What can you say about this hotel's location? Literally 20 seconds from walking out of the front door you are in Saint Mark's Square. The Doge's Palace, the Basilica, the Cafe Florian, Harrys Bar, gondola rides, trattoria and osteria all within a five minute walk. If you've never been before take some comfortable shoes and your wallet. Venice can be extremely expensive, but head away from the main tourist areas and you can drink and eat for very reasonable prices. This weekend I spent 28 euros on 2 Bellinis at Harry's Bar (nice to say I've been, but I wouldn't rush back), 25 euros on a coffee and tea and scones in the Florian (would definitely go back, the classiest cafe in the World), and 40 euros for an afternoon of beer, wine and bar food in a little osteria in Castello about 200 yards from Saint Mark's Square.

The night we arrived we were told of a \"beautiful boat ride\" that was to take us through all the canals, including \"the grand canal\" as a tour of the city. We were told that the gondolas \"do not operate at this time of night (11pm)\" which was meant to be the nicest time to go. We were also told that \"gondolas cannot go on the grand canal\" but the boat can. Finally, the captain of this \"romantic boat\" was to come to the hotel at 5 minutes to 11 to pick us up and take us to the boat. All this cost 130 Euros and what did we get? Lies, lies and more lies. First of all, the concierge finished his shift and saw us sitting there waiting for the captain to arrive (he had earlier told us to wait in the bar, where we did so for 25 minutes!!!) and only then, as an afterthought, did he approach us and say \"your taxi (yes taxi, all of a sudden it was not a romantic boat) is waiting for you downstairs, 200m on the right, just before the bridge.\" Then, the boat was merely a taxi. Nothing romantic just a taxi with the \"taxi\" sign taken off. Nothing more, nothing less. Furthermore, the driver did not say ONE SINGLE word. Forget about \"guided tour\" or \"tour\" of any sort. He just drives the taxi around and doesn't whisper a thing. Finally, and here's the best part, the following night we took a gondola ride, at 11pm, through the grand canal, for 80 Euros and the guy showed us famous peoples houses, historical landmarks, etc. I confronted the concierge about this and told him everything he said was a lie and unlike say the USA, where the customer is always right (and in this stage we most certainly were), he proceeded to say \"I'm sorry you feel that way, you must have misunderstood me because of my poor English\" which is rediculous because his English was that of an Oxford scholar. Also, whilst sitting in the bar, we overheard him \"sell\" this same \"boat ride\" to many guests, even though he told us \"you are very lucky because the boat only operates on Tuesday nights.\" What a bunch of lies, everything this hotel's concierge tells you, don't believe them...all lies! They sent us to Morano to look at the glass blowing factories...or so we thought. It's \"free\" they said...so we knew there was a catch. \"We take you there and bring you back.\" Of course, they did take us there...but when we asked how do we get back (after not buying anything) they said \"the ferry is just on your right hand side.\" You see, it's not an issue to take the ferry or go on a boat ride that's really just a taxi, but this hotel has a concierge that is trained to get you into these activities UNDER FALSE PRETENSES. Like another reviewer, we too checked into a \"non-smoking room\" that stunk of smoke. The concierge said they cannot control if someone previously had gone against their request and smoked in the room. So we asked to change rooms, which wasn't a problem, but there were of course more lies when I asked \"but if it is truly a non-smoking room, then why on earth does it have an ashtray in it?\" The response was \"it gives people a place to put things, such as coins.\" I mean, seriously, if you have any sense save yourself the grief and check-in elsewhere.
