{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent Hotel As an American who lives and works in Europe, I know a thing or two about european hotels.I have stayed at the Jan Tabak twice and recommend it without hesitation. It is located in a lovely area of exclusive homes I highly encourage a walking tour of. Bussum itself has a number of upscale boutique shops and trendy bars and cafes. The train station is only about a 5-10 minute walk, from which it is a 30 minute trip to Amsterdam.The rooms at the Jan Tabkar are spacious enough and comfortable. The breakfast bar is the best I have seen in Europe. And the price at about 100 euro per nite is a good value. Plus, free parking. Simply put, try it, you'll like it.", "Date": "Jul 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR124076351", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "DonSpry"}, {"Content": "Great hotel on outskirts of Amsterdam My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night after not being able to find accommodation in Amsterdam. It turned out to be a great decision. There is free parking at the hotel. The room was large with a king size bed. The bathroom was large as well. The breakfast was fantastic with many choices.It was a 15-20 minute walk to the train station in Bussum, down a quiet residential street. The train ride into Amsterdam takes 20 minutes. After a busy day in Amsterdam, we found it relaxing to take the train back to Bussum and have a chance to walk and wind down on the way back to the hotel.", "Date": "May 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR952978274", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Allison2"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d229238-r8140484-NH_Jan_Tabak-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "HotelID": "229238", "Price": "$234"}}
