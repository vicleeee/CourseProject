Every night some people would go out into the courtyard (even on a school night) around 11PM or midnight and make a complete ruccus for an hour or tow, that would eccho up to my room. It was awful, woke me up and I couldn't fall back asleep - and I'm not a light sleeper! I think those people live in the building and are not guests so you probably won't have better luck than I did. I called the reception multiple times to complain and there was no one there to pick up the phone, even if they claim to have a 24-hour reception. Being a woman alone, I didn't want to go downstairs or scream out the window so I had to suck it up and get no sleep. - The walls are absolutely paper thin and you can hear people walking and clearly make out what they're saying outside your room. That just added to the aggravation. - Although I had a confirmation, they didn't have a room for me when I arrived, which is really annoying. They ended up having to give me their junior suite (where the couch and curtain were stained and one of the phones didn't work). - I felt completely unsafe as this is an apartment building and people just come in and out without having to go through the reception. - My friend booked a promotion where she got a EUR 10 discount on her room. When we got there, the receptionist told us that was a mistake and she shouldn't have been able to get the discount online, but she would honor the offer. Upon checkout, a different receptionist charged her the EUR 10 and said she had to pay it. After putting up a fight, he relented. - The receptionist upon checkout said my credit card hadn't been charged since my room was never booked, and that I should BE HAPPY they gave me the junior suite. It was condescending and irritating. - Not the cleanest place I've been - crud stuck to my feet as I walked on the cold floor or my room. The phone handle was greasy. - The walls were beat up, scuffed up, and covered in plaster in some spots. The door locks on mine and my friend's room stuck and were hard to open. The one good thing about this hotel is the location - minutes from the Vatican - but I think you can probably do better staying at a B&B close by.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGreat location.\u201d", "Author": "judfry1", "ReviewID": "UR127103981", "Content": "The Amalia is in a great location of Rome.

At first, there was a discrepancy about the room - we had two adults and a child. We were told that no bed was available for the child - we would have to sleep everyone in a queen bed or everyone in 2 doubles. During that time, a queen and one double in a room became available for more money (20 extra Euro per night). But only for 3 of the nights. We took it. The room was spacious, clean, cool, with a great bathroom. The staff was great! Super withe my 7 year old son. Finally, the 3rd night came - we prepared to move to a 2 double bed and make due. Packing, we were told that they had arranged the reservations so that we could stay in our room. We were thrilled not to have to move!!! One negative: The continental breakfast - served each day - does not have offer enough food. We got there at 9am on the first morning - to find everything but cold cereal gone! Finally, the attendant - who appears about every 30+ showed up with new pastries - only to have all the previous attendees at breakfast literally lunge at the table and take all the good pastries again!! Because there is not enough placed out on the table to begin with....there is this mad rush to get the available food. We felt that this could be avoided - and felt the need to - the next morning - to set our clocks and get up early....JUST to get a decent breakfast. That said, we would gladly stay at the Amalia again. From the taxi driver arranged to pick us up....to the reception who gladly and happily took our bags for safe keeping...and arranged our room situation. Everyone was great! And the television offers BBC news in English. And despite having to pay 5 Euro for each 3 hour session of WiFi....still worth it: Good speed. Good access. So close to Vatican City, as described.

To be fair, I will start with the positives related to this hotel. The first is location. Only two blocks from the Vatican, we found this hotel to be a perfect base for our week-long stay in Rome. The neighborhood seemed friendly and Castroni's next door was a very nice stand-up lunch counter with excellent sandwiches at a good price (which was hard to find in Rome). On the other side of the hotel was a small vendor where we could buy bottled water each morning as we left for sightseeing. Secondly, there was a delightful young woman at the desk who was very helpful and cheerful. I asked that they accomodate us with an early breakfast on a couple of mornings (since our sightseeing departure was prior to the normal breakfast time) and she was happy to help us in that regard. Additionally, she answered any questions we had and didn't give us the impression that we were a bother to her. This hotel needs to be renovated. The carpet in our room was dirty (needed to be vaccumed) and had stains. The tiny bathroom had mold/mildew stains in the toilet bowl, on the wall near the ceiling and in the corners of the showwer. The bathroom needed a good scrub and disenfectant to remove the mildew. The first night, I called the front desk to inquire as to why our television was not working. The male desk clerk came to our room (he didn't appear to be happy regarding this imposition) and after some time discovered that a connection was unplugged. I then asked him for the numbers for English channels. After a considerable amount of time surfing the channels, he said he didn't know. A couple of days later, I called the front desk and asked again and was told they didn't know. After asking again, I was told that when they have a storm, the digital channel numbers change and they didn't know the English channel numbers (highly suspect explanation). So, we were not able to watch TV during our entire stay at Hotel Amaila. The first night, there was an incredible stench in the hallway outside of our room. I was not able to determine the source, but, fortunately it went away and we didn't have to deal with that again. We ran out of toilet paper on two ocasions during this stay. The third day, we came back from sightseeing to find that our door was left ajar (preseumably by the chamber maid). I called the front desk to report this to no real response. Two days later, we came back at the end of the day and again, our door was ajar. This contributed to my feelings of not feeling safe at this property. Fortunately, nothing was stolen from our room. The breakfast provided was marginal. There were plenty of breads and sweets along with coffee/tea. The meat provided was thinly sliced ham that tasted like it was from a can. The cheese was plastic wrapped slices. There was little to no variation from day to day. For the price I paid to stay at this hotel, the breakfast should have been better. The morning of our departure the power went out while we were getting ready to go to the airport. I called the front desk and apparently a breaker had been tripped. Thankfully power was restored. The room was small and the bathroom was micro-size. I was told prior to going to Rome to greatly reduce my expectations as compared to American hotels. Based on the price we paid (which in the US would have easily provided a room at a five-star hotel), I just could not bring myself to reconcile the price versus the condition of this property.

It's served from 7-9:30 am in a pleasant room, but the selection was very limited: cereal flakes, plain rolls, and various extremely sweet pastries. There were jams, honey, and one kind of soft cheese. The coffee was a major letdown. It tasted so awful that after a few tries I gave up and switched to tea, and this is the land of excellent coffee! We got in the habit of going to a great coffee shop down the block on Ottaviano each morning after leaving the hotel. My daughter has celiac disease (cannot digest gluten) and there was almost nothing she could have at the breakfast. The first day, she had 2 bowls of hot milk with honey. After that we found a grocery store, and brought fresh fruit, yogurt, muesli, raisins, and gluten-free bread with us to breakfast. My suggestion for the hotel would be, please add some fresh fruit, yogurt, maybe boiled eggs, and gluten-free bread (restaurants have it) to your offerings. Perhaps extend the breakfast hours to 10 am, since almost everyone seemed to rush in after 9. And please, please, brew some good coffee! Mille grazie!! I would love to stay here again, especially if these changes were made.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat Friendly Hotel\u201d", "Author": "nesrin_10", "ReviewID": "UR89915177", "Content": "This is the second time to stay in Amalia Hotel in Rome, it is great and friendly hotel.

July is probably Rome's busiest month, and the Amalia is located across the Tiber from most of the main tourist. areas, so it was a little quieter, which was nice in the evenings. It was great to be so close to the Vatican, though, and Line A is only about 2 blocks down from the hotel, which will take you pretty much anywhere else you want in the city. The Amalia was exactly what we expected from a Roman hotel. The room was small, with a queen-sized bed taking up most of the room. There was also a desk, a wardrobe, and a flat-screen TV mounted on the wall. The large window looked down on the street. We were on the second floor, which meant we didn't need to use the rickety elevator very often. The bed only had two pillows, but was surprisingly comfortable, and we got some of the best sleep of our vacation there despite the jetlag. The bathroom was probably the most disappointing aspect of the hotel. It had a toilet, duvet and sink. The shower was tiny with a plastic wrap-around door that leaked a bit, and there wasn't great water pressure. The breakfast nook was very typical, with coffee, juices, pastries, bread and cheese. The staff there and elsewhere in the hotel was always wonderful and attentive. They gave us some excellent recommendations for stores and restaurants. The internet is pretty expensive, so we always used a nearby internet cafe. Likewise calls to the US--they weren't outrageous but we could make them much cheaper just down the block. Overall, we had an excellent stay here. It's very basic, but that's all we were looking for--the main draw is obviously this remarkable city.

A woman that we met shortly after checking in got stung for 45 Euros to get her elderly father and herself a taxi to the hotel. Unbelievable, especially considering that taxi's directly from Ciampiano airport to City Centre hotels cost a fixed rate of 30 Euros. My wife and I got the metro directly from Termini to the hotel for 1 Euro each.

The staff were always very friendly, they even helped us when we had a request for a booking of a special sight-seeing. They speak English fluently, too. All in all: don't look for another hotel, go to the Amalia, it's a great experience! And, there's a nice restaurant just round the block (out of the hotel, to the left, then left again and it's on the right side of the road), called the Isola della Pizza, which was a great find: good food, not too expensive, wonderful antipasti misti and just lovely sizzling meats.", "Date": "August 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cbest location\u201d", "Author": "yorkieinlondon", "ReviewID": "UR18172370", "Content": "Stayed for 3 nights on a b & b basis. the hotel is clean, comfortable and absoultely in a fabulous location for seeing all the best attractions in Rome.

Visited the Callisto catacombs the cost was 6 euros it does take up half a day though. One of the best meals we had was in a chinese restuarant called Ni Hao on angolo Piazza just by the vatican city wall well worth the money.

Having checked out the hotel's website before we left, I was surprised to be allocated on arrival, a room on the 3rd floor that was about the size of a cell. I'm not exagerrating, I felt claustrophobic and knew immediately we could not comfortably spend 5 nights in it. Fine if it was a single room with a single bed for single occupancy but the double bed took the biscuit - there literally was not enough room to shimmy around it. I called reception, explained we were not satisfied and asked if we could see another room. After a bit of humming and hawing from the guy on the desk, I mentiond that I'd noticed that they advertised superior rooms on their website and that we would be willing to pay a supplement should one of those rooms be available. We were shown to a decently sized twin room but told that it could only be for one night and they would have to reallocate us the following day. This was fine, just wanted out of that room as soon as possible! As it turned out the next day we were told that we could stay in the room for the remainder of our stay (5 nights) at an extra 50E per night. A good result and still what we considered to be good value for money. The room itself had air con, a window (the other room didn't adding to the closed-in feeling), tv with satellite channels (not important but background noise in the morning to help wake up!), a safe, mini bar and a good size bathroom with bidet, and shower over bath. Always plenty hot water - no complaints there. Housekeeping was good and thorough. We never bothered with breakfast in the hotel but did stop by at the Cafe Castroni just downstairs from the hotel most mornings - it was a nice spot to sit outside and fuel up before heading on our daily adventures. The hotel was v. handy for, as well as St. Peter's and the Vatican, the underground station. Two or 3 stops and you were in the centre of town. Most days we would take the underground in and then meander our way back to the Amalia, taking in the sights on the way. There was a good little bar just around the corner on P. Risorgimento, next to the Irish bar. Another good spot to stop and have coffee or a cold beer and snack, watching the world go by and St. Peter's dome lit up in the evening. We did eat in Il Toscana downstairs from the hotel on one of the nights. This place was always packed and so, being foodies, were keen to try it. Sadly, it was not somewhere I would recommend - the food was great but the haughty and aloof service left a bad taste and we could not leave quickly enough. We got the impression that they did not need nor encourage business from tourists. A place we did eat in that I could not rave about enough was situated just off Via Tritone. Take the metro to Barberini - walk one block down Tritone and then cut in to the left onto a cobbled street with a church as though heading towards the Trevi Fountain. The restaurant was on the left hand side with a good size dining area outside underneath a canopy. Unfortunately we didn't get the name but dined there 2 nights in a row - their smoked mozzarella stuffed with mushrooms and olives was to die for!! A taxi into town in the evening never cost more than 10E - including tip. Beware, though, one night (a Sunday) we went to take a taxi back and before we got in the driver said 20E before the meter starts. We questioned it and he got irate saying that it was Sunday and therefore a holiday, citing \"maybe in your country .... blah\". We didn't hang about. Walked up to the main stance at Barberini and checked with another driver who confirmed that he was blatantly trying to rip us off. Almost but thankfully we were not victim to this rip-off merchant but asI say, watch out, because he did look completely legit. The other driver we told took a note of his number as he was still sitting at the corner when we went by. Back to the hotel ... On the day of departure, we had an evening flight and so enquired a couple of nights before whether a late check-out would be possible and how much it would be. We were quoted 50E and in the end decided not to bother because, as we explained to the front-house manager, it really was just to come back after a last day of sight-seeing for a shower before our flight. As it transpired, on the morning of check out. a different member of staff told us we could leave our luggage in a room on the second floor and to feel free to use the shower and changing facilitie next to the breakfast room. Result - what a handy thing and had we known we wouldn't even have enquired about the late check-out. Am sure the other member of staff could've told us about this but there did seem to be abit of an indifferent attitude from most of the team. Rounding up, I would say that I might stay here again but perhaps would like to try a different location in the city.

We had room 506. This is a very nice hotel, with adequate accommodations and although it has some minor issues I would consider this an excellent place to stay in Rome if your main interest is being close to the Vatican. The positivies: The windows are substantially sound proofed, but this part of the city is NOT noisy. The room is large enough for 2 people to be in the room at the same time with a moderate amount of luggage, and not feel like you want to be alone. We had a large amount of luggage and were able to use the \"dead\" spaces for storing our suitcases. The bed was hard - which we like, but that's a personal preference. The bathroom was also adequately sized (my spouse and I are not slim) but the shower stall is somewhat small. The hotel staff were very pleasant and put up with our foibles, ie. American Tendency to be direct with a request right after a greeting (Eg. Hello! I need...). Air Conditioning worked very well and was only necessary a few times since we were on the top floor, and there were only 2 hot days. Hotel staff is very friendly and courteous. The negatives: The housecleaning is vague. On the 6th day I had to ask if they were EVER going to change the sheets. I was told the sheets are changed every 3/4 days (very vague). We were there 10 days and they changed the sheets once. Thankfully my spouse and I are very clean people so it wasn't a hardship - I'd watch out on the sheet and towels. There was one day the towels left of the floor were placed back as \"clean\" on the rack. I complained and received new ones right away. The bathroom fixtures (bidet, basin, toilet and shower) were cleaned every day which is very important to me. The choice of toilet paper brand - well, it was interesting. Seemed to be more air than paper. Querks: Breakfast was okay and adequate. Breads, cereals, prunes, packaged toast, sweetcakes and rolls. If you like hot milk with your coffee (which I do), this was a very nice choice. Choice of orange and pineapple juice and water and milk to drink. Fruit cocktail not a great choice but hey, the breakfast was included with the room. When we took to \"old-fashioned\" elevator only my husband and I could fit...I'm sure it could hold 5 slim persons, but it was a fun way of getting up 6 flights of stairs. Hanging out the windows on the top floor on the street side was also a cultural experience. This is a residential area with heavy tourist traffic. You can see the gypsy beggars arrive in the morning and \"assume their position\" which makes them look physically handicapped - they're not. I've watched and seen them \"do their work.\" Don't feel sorry for them. So with all these remarks I would definitely stay here again.

Inside the room, on the notice giving the maximum price for the room, the only price given was as a single room, confirming our impression that the room was not intended to be a double room. The woman at the desk, while trying to be pleasant, was unhelpful in finding a comfortable solution (options were to get two rooms and pay the difference, or get a room with a bathroom down the hall). When we checked out, the manager would not even talk to us about our complaint, which I thought was highly unprofessional, so I was left to discuss this with the employee at the desk. We were charged for a double room (55 Euros higher per night than the posted maximum charge for the room). After the employee told us there was nothing she could do about the price, which we had agreed to on Expedia, I persisted in saying we hadn't been given what we requested on Expedia, and she finally (after a long and tedious conversation) took a total of 30 Euros off a two night stay. In addition to the uncomfortable room size/bed situation and lack of managerial attention, I would warn people that the hotel wasn't always quiet.

The 3 star rating of the hotel reflects what you get. The hotel is part of an old building, and the hotel accomodation is split across a number of floors, with a number of other small businesses also operating from the same building. As a result of this, the main shared stairwell is a litlle sparse and looks slightly run down. Our room was on the fourth floor and looked pretty much like the images shown on the hotels website. As some others have already commented, the beds are a little on the firm side, but not to the point that it would stop anyone from sleeping after a busy day of sight-seeing! The bathrooms were modern and clean, but the showers are very small (2/3 the size of a normal shower tray). The breakfast provided is VERY basic, a few types of cereal, some tinned fruit, 2-3 types of cake and some bread rolls. However, there are plently of reasonably priced coffee shops close by if you prefer something more substantial.

Apart from him all other taxi drivers were good and on our return to Termini station it cost 15 euros. Do go on the Tour bus which can be picked up outside St Peters for only 13 euros for the day.

The air conditioning unit worked well and didn't cost us extra (it does in ALOT of other Italian hotels). We were quickly supplied with extra towels and pillows as soon as we asked for them.

The best thing about our stay was the staff. All of the receptionists were very helpful with all of our questions and requests, especially a young man named Giovanni. He single-handedly made our trip twice as good by helping us with directions, travel advice, helping to arrange various trips, and filling us in on what to watch out for in Rome (ie unofficial taxis requesting outrageous fares etc). Our trip wouldn't have been as enjoyable without his help. I loved the Amalia and will def be staying there again next fall. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the breakfast buffet was pretty sparse and only served cold bread, but I quickly found out thats the norm in Rome.

The AC would continue to run however. We were not charged for the use of the hotel safe. In the larger of the rooms that we occupied (501) we had a suite type room which provided a separate living area with a sleeper sofa, T.V. and desk. The bedroom was a queen sized bed that was very comfortable with good sheets and pillows. The bathroom was equally good with plenty of hot water and good pressure. The one room we had faced an inside courtyard with not much of a view, but the other room (506) offered a good view of the street below.
