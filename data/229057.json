You expect Florence to be this postcard place and it is when you arrive at a place like this that you realize it is not all postcards. This is far from the center and not convenient at all, unless you are driving through Italy and you can't afford or don't want to pay the Florence congestion charge or pricey parking fees in the center. I would say the only positive aspect about this hotel is the parking. The hotel itself is outdated, depressing and expensive for what it is.

I never saw another guest even into the evening hours! This made me very uncomfortable and I couldn\u9225\u6a9b help but wonder what was it that I didn't know about this place that others did. The receptionist was totally bored/uninterested and did not help me with any details such as: would I like a wake-up call or did I need a taxi in the morning. When I asked for a non-smoking room, the response was that they do not exist in Florence. The WORST, however, was that upon my departure very early the next morning, I had to wake up the clerk working at the desk by yelling 4 or 5 times: is anybody here? This was most distressing to me as I was depending upon this staff to call a taxi for me. They would not call the night before as I had requested telling me that it was not possible to make a reservation in advance for a taxi. Finally, as a very fitting conclusion to this dismal experience, I was charged again at the desk with the statement that the room was not paid for. This was a shocker to me since I had booked it online and had already paid for it with my credit card. But, since I needed a taxi, I figured I better do what they say and pay for the room again.

It is advertised as a 4* hotel but does reach the standard we would have expected from a 4*. None of the reception staff was particularly helpful and, in one case, the female receptionist on duty on the evening of 3 August was rude and unwelcoming on our arrival to the hotel. We asked if we could book advanced tickets for the Uffizi through the reception desk for the following day and were met with a dismissive shrug and a statement to the effect that it would probably be too busy. In other words, she wasn't even going to try. As this is one of the services the hotel offers on its website, we were quite annoyed to find that the staff actually have no interest in providing the service when requested. Our rooms were not the best either. The beds were hard and the carpet looked like it had not been vacuumed for a few days. The ensuite bathroom, while large, did not have any soap. The mini bar was not stocked with all the items listed in the information booklet and we were concerned that we would be charged for the missing items. The hotel restaurant is poor value for money and there are very few alternatives around the area. Despite walking for several kilometers, we could not find a shop anywhere near the hotel. All in all, a very disappointing experience and we recommend that you spend your money on a nicer hotel in a better location.

We were first shown to a room that was simply uninhabitable. It was dirty, old cold and uncomfortable. I could not stay in this room. I was paying four star money for this, and was horrified and shocked. After some protestation and negociation (they insisted on a price increase!) I was shown a room. As I had nowhere else to stay that night, I had to accept this, but it too was awful.My son suffered foodpoisoning that night, and the doctor that eventually arrived appeared to be in league with this operation, and appeared to be used to attending the hotel, and was ready with excuses. The location of the hotel was nowhere near the centre of Florence, and I ventured out for breakfast....it is situated in a shady part of town and I returned after about 300 yards in fear.

This is an honest to god review. This was definitely the WORST of all 5 hotels we stayed at on our trip to France and Italy. I dont know where to begin.Location: We trained into Florence from Venice and found a cab to the hotel (17 euros) to find that the hotel is nowhere near the central of Rome. Even if you fly in to Florence please do not stay here. We were on a budget and could not afford to cab it everywhere so we opted to take the bus. First off the staff was no help in informing which busses to take so we finally figured it out on our own. You must walk 7-10 minutes from the hotel to catch either the 29, 30 or 35 which takes you into the heart of Florence at the train station. From there we just walked around to different destinations as this is where you want to be. We tried to go out our first night at the hotel only to find there was almost NOTHING around the neighborhood. On your walk to the bus stop there will be two restuarants towards the left, we chose the pizzeria which was average at best.Staff: Useless. All of the hotels we stayed in during our trip informed us upon arrival whether there was a morning breakfast. This staff said nothing (the breakfast is decent and was included which we missed on the first morning there as we did not know there was one) they just gave a room key and pointed us to the direction.Rooms: Nice size but thats the ONLY good thing. This is where the trip gets nasty. Hot water shuts off sporadically. Honestly, we had hot showers 2 of the 4 nights we were there I counted. NO Air conditioning, it was defintiely needed because for some reason the hotel was blasting the heater the entire time and the lobby and hallways felt like i was walkiong through hell. So naturally the heat transfers into the room. When we called reception to tell the we cant get the A/C to work they simply said thats because it is not connected. Useless. So naturally, we open the window, we enjoyed the breeze until we noticed that the windows (we were on the first floor) opened to a parking lot which gave direct access to our room from the window if someone wanted to come in say if we fell asleep with them open. No screens no bars no nothing. We were so hot we took this chance only to worry at each voice or sound we heard outside. The mosquitos that flew in were the least of our problems. I recommend staying closer to the downtown area and shell out the bus fare and heartache that we have gone through. It is always convenient to be in walking distance of everything rather than walking 10 minutes from the bus stop at night in a neighborhood you are not familiar with. I will never come back here in my lifetime and would not want anyone else to experience what we went through.
