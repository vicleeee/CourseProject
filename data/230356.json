I was moved to another hotel that was horrible. The room was so tiny I couldn't open my suitcase if the bathroom door was open. The hotel where I was placed was in the area of the Hauptbahnhof where I had never before seen people sitting on a sidewalk injecting drugs into themselves.

We wanted a small, quiet hotel that was convenient to the rail system. It was perfect for us. We found it easily upon our exit from the U-Bahn. Although the hotel wasn't in an area that had much going on in the immediate vicinity all kinds of dining and shopping was available just a few short blocks away (an easy walk). It was nice for us, actually, not to be in the middle of it all and be able to come back to a quiet and very comfortable room. After having a meal and doing a litle window shopping we basically wanted to sleep off our jet lag. The room was very nice. Quite large by most European standards, in my opinion. The desk staff was helpful and friendly. The only drawback would have been that since we were on a strange sleep schedule and awoke at about 3:30am there was no coffee available to us. None in the room and the restaurant didn't open for several hours so all we could do is wait. The breakfast buffet was wonderful, however, and we were sorry to have to eat so quickly and run to catch a train. It was a charming hotel that we would highly recommend.", "Date": "Jan 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR712056517", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Sunlover_In_Oregon"}, {"Content": "Quite liked this hotel Stayed here on two different occassions for business. Stayed in the Comfort category and the room and bathroom were a good size. Comfortable beds and nice decor. Breakfast was really good in this hotel- wide choice and friendly staff. There is a bar where you can pick up bar meals too but of a much better quality that what you get for most pub lunches in Britain. There is a nice Italian restaurant just 100 years down the road ( turn right as you come out of the hotel) and we ate there on two nights- excellent food. Staff were very friendly. HOWEVER, our flight was on a Sunday and we came in on Sunday afternoon and the hotel was dead. No bar, no tea/coffee making facitlties in the room, nothing- dire. So do not arrive into Germany on a Sunday as a tourist into small hotels and expect a drink or food. As my husband has mobility difficulties, this meant we had to walk out in the rain and search for something to drink, food to eat etc.. not a good start. However, the hotel itself is fine and I would certainly stay here again, despite being in a quieter area. Actually, the old town- the Romer is only 10/12 minutes walk away- so there is plenty nearby.", "Date": "Apr 14, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR812824670", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ScottishPrincess"}, {"Content": "Nice Hotel, nice location Good hotel with best location for shopping, walking around and even for business depending where should you be working.

Charming 3+ boutique hotel. I stayed in a single designer room with an Oriental theme. The only complaint about the room's facilities being that the shower was a bit small- I'm not too big so it wasn't a problem, but I can imagine that men would have a tough time. The bathroom is quite spacious, so there is room for a bigger shower. The room was very comfortable with several lighting options that created a cosy atmosphere. I felt very at home here and looked forward to returning to my room after a hectic day at the Messe. And it was a pleasure to wake up to the hearty breakfast buffet - cheerful breakfast room and staff. The hotel's bar is really cosy and the reception equally as welcoming.", "Date": "Feb 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR115137278", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "arttest"}, {"Content": "Wouldn't want to stay anywhere else This was a very plesant surprise.
