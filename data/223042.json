I was with my wife and 16 year old daughter for a 2-day competition she was in at the the convention center. We were woken at 2 am on Sunday morning by the sound of a man ranting and trying to kick down a door and therating to kill the occupant of that room. Needless to say that we were very scared. I called the front desk ( it took 2X for the desk to pickup). The man at the desk said he went outside - as he must have heard it as well - but didnt see anyone. I asked him to call the police. He was reluctant but said he would. I waited a few minutes but decided to call 911 myself. I reported it they took my information and the said they would dispatch someone to come. We didn't see or hear anyone come so I really don't know if they responded or not. In any event, the man came back several times threating the occupant AFTER I had called the police. I stayed up ( as did my daughter and wife ) with the light off not knowing whether or not this man would try to enter other rooms. The rooms have floor to celing windows adjacent to the door -- so he wouldn't need to break through the door - just break the window and walk in. Obviously, I cant say that this is a common occurence but once was enough for me and I would not want anyone to share our awful experience - so be careful!", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Value!\u201d", "Author": "Steve W", "ReviewID": "UR126593507", "Content": "The Rodeway Inn Convention Center is an older building around a mile from LA Live, the LA Convention Center, and the Staples Center.

Lastly, complimentary continental breakfasts were an unexpected touch, although the food really was limited. Still, the fresh oranges, bananas, cereal, and bagels got me by until lunchtime elsewhere.

Our stay was for seven nights. Location is in a relatively low density area of mixed retail commercial and residential use west of Downtown and east of Korea Town.

However, we observed no untoward elements or safety threats and it was fairly quiet at night. The motel has free open and covered off street parking. It states that there are fewer parking spaces than rooms, but arriving back several nights between 10 and 11 PM parking spaces were available. The alternative is street parking, which appears to be in short supply. Several public surface transit lines are within a few blocks. The Red Line subway is about five blocks. Restaurants and retail services are on Olympic Blvd, the arterial street fronting the motel. The motel building is older but has been updated. It has three levels with stairs and one small elevator. There is a common room in which a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continental breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is offered and a small swimming pool. Rooms are accessed from exterior walkways. We had two rooms. They were of reasonable size, clean with some minor wear and tear, and pleasantly decorated; see included pix. The rooms had individual wall air conditioners/heaters and opening, screened, insulated windows with interior adjustable wood shutter coverings. The baths had slab granite sink counters and in a separate room tub/shower and commode. Water pressure and hot water availability were adequate. Rooms had small refrigerators, microwave ovens, hair dryers, iron and ironing board, small low quality clock radio, telephone, and large television. Light fixtures were adequate. Furniture included a queen size bed, two bedside cabinets, a desk with chair, dresser with TV cabinet above, wall mirrors, and a clothes hanging area. One room had a large \u00e2\u20ac\u0153easy chair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Beds were firm and comfortable with sheets, blanket, bedspread, and four somewhat lumpy but adequate pillows. There was no evidence of bed bugs or any other insects. The staff was agreeable, attentive, and helpful.

I checked every hotel in downtown and was surprised to see moderately rated properties were well over $150 a night. So I weaved my way through the Trip Advisor lists until I found the Rodeway Inn for under $100. I had the same concerns as everyone else on the board, particularly the safety issue. I have to say, this hotel is a pretty decent value for downtown LA. The parking is free, the wireless is free, and the convention center is only a quick drive away. The bus lines are also plentiful, as another person mentioned. The food situation is bit dicey. El Pollo Loco, MickD, and a smattering of mom and pop places are nearby. There is a 7-11 next door. The area is okay, not quite the place for an evening stroll, but then neither is anywhere in downtown LA. The check inn was friendly and smooth, and the room was clean. For those of you not familiar with downtown LA, you should know that parking is practically non-existent. Most hotels will run you over $150, charge for parking, wireless, and the food prices will be astronomical. A one night stay can turn into a pricey nightmare.

However for a no-frills, clean and comfortable stay near to the Convention Center (not that we were using it) and also near LA Live (which is not yet built) only 20 minutes drive from Hollywood, this would suit. We did not use public transport - we hired a car - so our review is based on you having a car to get around LA. There was ample parking. Check-in was relatively easy, well-explained about the amenities. Friendly staff. The room was basic but clean, it was comfortable as there were tea and coffee making facilities, a microwave and fridge in the room, as well as a well-decent air conditioning unit and TV. The bathroom had towels for 2 guests and a separate area with mirror and hairdryer, there was also somewhere to hand your clothes. Breakfast was comprised of juices, tea and coffee, toast and muffins, cereals and pastries. A small area just off the pool was available however only 3 or 4 tables to sit at. There was a pool area, which was small and looked OK but we didn't use it as we were only there one night. In terms of location, places to eat are not very many, however we did eat at a Mexican Grill just down the road and it was a friendly enough.

The area is OK, not the best location but it's not a dirty rundown location either. It's clean & the staff is friendly. Sheets & towels changed daily. They are washed on the premises so you know they wash them. My room had a slight musty smell. I had an air freshener in my room the whole time. Keep the A/C on, that helps w/the smell. They have free internet, you have to get a free password/ID to log on from the front desk everyday bec it only lasts 24 hours. The connection is really, really slow, that was annoying. Parking is very cramped so it's a good idea to have a small car. On the morning of my check-out I returned to find the drivers side view mirror of my rental car was broken off! There are cameras in the parking lot but they have signs they are not responsible for damages. I didn't have any of the free breakfast. I was basically, coffee and some pastries. Do not waste your time. Micky D's is right on the corner. For a quick bite, go eat there. There is also a knock off Taco Bells next door as well. I did not eat there so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on it. There are no irons in the rooms. If you get one from the front desk, ask for an iron w/knobs. The first night they gave me one w/no knob so I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t regulate how hot it got and the water leaked out of it. They do have good ones, you just have to be specific.
