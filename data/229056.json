Can't say enough about the service. We had numerous special requests and they always came to our rescue. We traveled on a mom/daughter trip. There were 4 of us. My friend's mom accidentally dropped her bracelet down the drain the night before leaving. Of course we were pressed to get to the airport, reported the situation and expected we would never see the bracelet again. The staff not only retrieved the bracelet, but mailed it back to the US. This type of service is what sets this hotel far apart from the others. We hope to return someday.

The loction of the hotel is also very convenient, in that we walked EVERYWHERE, and yet it was all walking distance. Also, Rome is not a particularly quiet place, but this was just far enough away from the major attractions that we could sleep. I don't quite understand why people complain about room sizes.

The location was excellent, just a half a block from the Piazza Barberini. It's within walking distance of both the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain. (Both were so crowded when we were there, you could barely see anything.) It's also right across the street from the Plazzo Barberini--a wonderful palace with magnificent art work and the most fabulous fresco ceilings! And no crowds. The Hop-on-Hop-off buses stop at he Piazza Barberini, there is also a taxi stand there, as well as a subway stop. We had planned to do the \"Hop\" bus, but we found that taxis were inexpensive and were a better alternative, since you didn't have to wait for the bus. The breakfast room is on the 6th floor, with a wall of windows over looking Rome to the west, including a great view of the dome of St. Peter's. There were lots of choices for breakfast, from scrambled eggs and cereal to the most delicious pastries ever. This is a great room! The hotel has free wi-fi, and also a computer available if you don't have your own device. The front desk was very accommodating. As soon as we arrived, we asked them to get us reservations to visit the Villa Borghese and also for a tour of the Vatican Museum. They did both immediately and graciously. Before we left home, we contacted them by email and asked them to arrange for a car to meet us at the cruise port at Civitavecchia. They made the arrangements for us, and it cost less than our travel agent could arrange. They also arranged for a car to take us to the airport. This was a very satisfactory stay.

The rooms were comfortable - on the small side - but amply furnished; the bathrooms large and very well-maintained. Very good restaurant recommendations nearby. Located one block from the metro (Piazza Barberini) and Via Veneto; five minutes from the Trevi and walking distance to all. Well-priced off-season rate which included a buffet breakfast.

My wife and I liked everything about the hotel. Reception staff were efficient, friendly and very polite, every day. Breakfast room staff too, were polite and professional. The buffet breakfast gave a good range of food, from cereals, fruit, croissants, bacon-egg-sausage etc. Very cleanly presented. Our room was small, but tastefully furnished. Everything about the hotel, looked clean and well maintained. Well located - approx 5mins walk to Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain & the shops. We enjoyed an end of day drink in the 6th floor, rooftop bar. A small hotel with a BIG positive result for us.

Quiet location, good breakfast. The rooftop breakfast terazza opens in May, so we missed it .. but it is beautiful up there. Would stay here again, or recommend to anyone in a heartbeat. Pricey, but so is all of central Rome. Only if you have your heart set on staying in a particular location ...
