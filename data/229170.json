Lots of restaurants near-by, several cafes, one of the best coffeeshops (Het Ballonettje), the Artis (zoo), Resistance Museum, Werthiem Park, Hortus Botanicus, Rembrandthuis Museum (where Rembrandt lived), and the University of Amsterdam all within walking distance. A little pricey perhaps, especially if you don't spend much time in the room, but ask for special deals, they can usually help you out.

The hotel seemed very good value and the reviews for this hotel were mainly good. LOCATION: The location was perfect. We walked to the hotel from the train station when we arrived, this was an easy walk but probably best to get a tram if you have trouble walking or children. There is a tram stop just outside the hotel so that would also be an easy convenient way of getting to the hotel. I chose the hotel as it looked like it was within walking distance of most places and it was. It was just about 20minutes to the very centre of town, with plenty of sights, cafes, bars and things to do in that distance. You walk past the Portuguese Synagogue, Jewish Historical Museum and Rembrandts House before you get to Waag Square. The hotel is on a lovely quite road and opposite the Artis Zoo area. There are cafes and bakeries on this road as well as a tattoo museum. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a very active person but found I could do lots of walking and the route into the centre of Amsterdam was not a trek! SERVICE & HOTEL: The staff were very polite, welcoming and well mannered, also very well dressed. Checking in was easy and straight forward. We were also given a hotel gift bag containing pens, sweets, lip balm, toothbrushes and the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own quick guide too Amsterdam. We were not expecting that and it was a nice touch. We had a swipe card as our key which worked every time without any problems. The hotel was smart, modern and elegant as well as warm cosy and welcoming on the cold January night that we checked in. We did not have breakfast but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d imagine it was going to be good. There were vending machines with hot drinks, crisps and beer for anyone coming in late and needing some refreshments. This was handy. The beds were made and towels changed daily and the cleaning/maid staff were very friendly and polite. We were also allowed to leave our luggage at the hotel in the luggage room all day. This service was free of charge where many hotels would charge you. Check out time was also 12pm Midday\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6which was wonderful!!! PLEASE NOTE: We had to pay a City Tax upon leaving the hotel but that is the same in ALL Amsterdam hotels so we were expecting to pay it. Be aware of this as it is not the hotel being bad it is a normal tax that must be paid. I have seen some bad reviews about this but I think they are by people who have not done their research, or checked their booking information properly. ROOM: We were in a room on the 3rd floor, there was a convenient lift for us to use. The room was very modern, sleek and city style. They had artwork/d\u00c3\u00a9cor to compliment the city and the headboard was engraved with the shapes of the Amsterdam city skyline. The room was small but with plenty of space to get around the bed and for our suitcases. The one wall was taken up with windows giving us a lovely view of the houses and gardens behind the hotel. The wardrobe was spacious and had an electronic safe that worked really well. There were tea/coffee making facilities and a flat screen tv that had a personalised welcome greeting on it when we came into the room. The room was bright, airy, clean smelling and modern. Everything we needed was there and everything was in full working order. BED: It was a double done continental style with 2 mattresses together and separate duvets. There were lots of pillows to make the bed nice and to use as many as you required. The sheets were very clean, warm and soft. The bed was incredibly comfortable and I looked forward to sleeping in it every night. BATHROOM: The washroom was small but perfect. It was laid out like a continental wet room, where the shower is pretty much in the room. This is normal for the continent. There was also space under the sink for bathroom things. There was also complimentary soap, shower caps and shower gel. The shower was nice and hot and powerful. There was an electric shaving point and a hairdryer too. OVERALL: Lots of the reviews were poor because the rooms were small, I think that this is completely unfounded as the size does not make the room. Some reviews suggested that it would not be suitable for a couple to stay. This is also wrong as we had a lovely stay! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say this hotel is perfect for families (\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6as the zoo is across the road), and for couples as it is nice and quiet but close to everywhere you need to go. The hotel also looks very suitable for people on business as the rooms were well equipped with internet points, power, stationary and the hotel has a conference room. I thought maybe when we got there we would need to catch a tram into town but actually we were so close to the centre that we really couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t justify a tram. We walked to Vondel Park, Jordaan, the Red Light District, Oosterpark, Leidsplein with no problems\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6even though the weather was bad we still managed to do lots of exploring! I will definately stay at Eden Lancaster on my next trip to Amsterdam. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to come back it was just lovely.

One of our rooms was fine, well equipped and spacious. The other room was half the size - a pretty severe inconsistency when both parties are paying the same price. Outside our rooms on the radiator, we found a key card, perhaps left by a member of staff - One of my colleagues thinking it was for her room unlocked her door, however then found her own key in her pocket. On further probing we discovered that this key could unlock both doors. Leaving a master key lying around outside peoples rooms is a pretty big security issue. Not massively impressed. My other colleague popped down to find a manager, and was informed by said KGB operative that he was the manager, a statement that he quickly retracted on further questioning. Pretending to be a manager to a guest?! Mad! Apart from these little incidents we had a very pleasant night out in the city - marred only by being woken up at 11.00am by a housekeeper asking if the room was vacant. Clearly not.

We didn't spend very long in the hotel as there is so much to see in the city but it was a decent place to rest my head at the end of a long day! The rooms are quite small but beds were clean and comfortable, the linen wasn't changed during our stay but I wasn't expecting this for a 3 star hotel, we were only there for 2 nights after all! The decor is themed to the city which we liked instead of a generic hotel. There are amsterdam pictures on the wall etc. There was a TV in the room although some channels could not get a signal, as we only had the TV on for a few minutes after getting into bed, this didn't bother us (what's the point of going on holiday to watch TV?!?!), there are enough English channels to make do! The bathroom again was small but functional, there was fresh sealed soap, shower caps and plenty of clean towels. The only criticism I have of the bathroom is that the loo did have some limescale staining. There was a selection of tea and coffee in the room but only enough for one tea and one coffee. This was replaced each day but a bigger selection would have been nice (I expect we could have got more if we'd asked at reception). The breakfast isn't great but edible, there is plenty of variety, continental and an attempt at full English (shredded bacon, boiled or scrambled eggs) but no fried eggs, beans or tomatoes. A little disappointing on the whole. We found the location of the hotel to be fine,it was nice to be a little way out of the city so it wasn't noisy. The zoo is on the same street although we did not visit it. The number 9 tramstop is literally just outside the door of the hotel. We used the tram to and from the train station but chose to walk the rest of the time to allow us to see more of the city. It is about 15 minutes into the centre of the city but after approx 5-10 minutes you arrive at shops, coffeeshops etc. From the airport, it's around 40 euro for a taxi but we chose the authentic route of train and tram, the trams are great and staff are very helpful. The train station was a little confusing as it was so busy but again, the staff are helpful. The machines at the station were not accepting cash at the time so we had to use the kiosk but this gave me chance to make sure we had the right tickets etc. Overall a very enjoyable break.

I was therefore very disappointed with my experience - I think I have only once ever stayed in a worse hotel room. The room itself is my main complaint. It was far too small to be comfortable. There was only a foot gap between the end of the bed and the wall - and in walking down this gap to get to the other side of the bed (the only space large enough to place luggage) I had to duck under the television that was hanging from the wall. Once I had put my luggage down there was no room for me to manoeuvre in the space; the only other space was the wardrobe, but to fit one of my suitcases in there, I needed to perch the electric fan from the wardrobe on top of my suitcase, and then had no room for my clothes. The beds were not in line with the headboard - I assume they had had to be moved over in order to be able to open the front door and the bathroom door, and as a result, one of the reading lights was directly over my pillow. Someone else had obviously already had problems with this lack of space, as the plastic of the light was broken, and it was dangling down with it's cables on show. The bathroom was just as bad. The toilet was cramped between the shower and the wall - so to sit on the toilet, I had to have one leg pushed against the wall, and the other in the shower, which would not have been so much of a problem if I could have pushed the shower curtain out of the way, but it was held in place just where my knee needed to go. On top of this, the safe in the room did not work, and the fire escape details in the room were broken, I assume hit by someone's suitcase. When going down to breakfast I found broken tape which seemed to have been a no entry - and a sign, not particularly obvious, saying no entry, construction site (or something similar) so I had to ask at reception, where they told me I had to take a different route to breakfast. The breakfast itself was satisfactory, but at 15 Euros, far too expensive. That following day I got up early, having slept well (the bed was comfortable, but the pillows not), but on arriving back at my room after 2pm, found that it had not been cleaned; this was the final straw, so I decided to ask if I could move room. The receptionist told me that he would have to check if my room had been serviced, and made a call. Then he told me I couldn't change room as it had been serviced already!!!! That did not go down very well, but he quickly agreed to let me change room, after I told him it had definitely not been serviced. Initially he offered me a room for 25 Euros more! But when I told him I was not willing to pay more, he offered me a different room for the same price. This new room, although still small, was an acceptable size, with nothing broken - and only the grubby carpets (as were also in the first room) letting the room down. Finally, I left my luggage in the left luggage room - having been told the room was open. I assumed it had just been unlocked, but when I returned later, I realised that actually the room had been left unlocked all day, and anyone could have walked in and taken my luggage.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai", "Title": "\u201cexcellent hotel... value for money\u201d", "Author": "deepu_uk", "ReviewID": "UR115791628", "Content": "I was initially skeptical after reading some of the review but when i went there things were completely different the overall service was awesome needless to say i will definitely stay the next time i visit Amsterdam. superb hotel, friendly staff, close to the city center, clean rooms, breakfast spread was amazing.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY, NY", "Title": "\u201cFine, good location\u201d", "Author": "NYCmama", "ReviewID": "UR115094360", "Content": "but the rugs were a bit dirty.

I took great care in selecting this hotel. It is a little out of town but that is what I wanted. It takes 5-10 minutes on the tram to get into town and we even walked to central station from the hotel on our last day (due to a tram strike) which only took 30 minutes at a leisurely pace. The area is quiet and away from the hustle and bustle - perfect for couples and families. We were welcomed immediately when we arrived by a polite and pleasant young man. We stayed in room 208. The hotel rooms in Amsterdam are generally quite small but we didn't need a large room. Our double bed was two twin beds pushed together but this is common practice in hotels (I worked in hotels for years while I was at university) and makes sense. We were given two single duvets instead of a double which we actually really liked! No fighting for covers (we may implement this at home!). The bed and pillows were supersoft and we were reluctant to get out of bed in the morning. When we arrived back to the hotel each day our room was clean and tidy - we didn't have to ask for anything. Breakfast wasn't included in our room rate which we knew. Initially we thought that 15 euros per person was quite expensive but it is actually pretty good value compared to what we would have had to pay in a restaurant for the same meal. The quality and selection of food was great - sausages, bacon, eggs, breads, cheeses, meats, spreads, jams and a selection of hot and cold juices. The breakfast staff were excellent as well - efficient and friendly. I'd recommend this hotel to most people. However, if you're planning wild nights out then don't stay here. The trams stop around 12.30 and a taxi will cost around 12 euros. My fiance is returning to Amsterdam in April for his stag weekend and probably won't stay at the Eden Lancaster for this reason. In saying that, he and his friends are keen to stay at one of the more central Eden hotels instead. A lot of people will always try to find something to complain about wherever they stay. The hotel isn't right in the centre of town but it doesn't claim to be. It is on more than one tram route though and the trams run every 6 minutes through the day and every 10 minutes at night.

So, after you checkin you take stairs to carry your luggages to the basement where your room is located (no elevator access). Pass through narrow corridor. It felt like checking in to a submarine. For elder persons be sure to doublecheck that your room is on upper levels with elevator access. When we arrived at 13.00 we could not check in. This was our bad hotel policy and reservation form indicates that the check out time is 15:00. So take this into account. (actually isn't it a bit late for a check-in; but this might be a general rule in all hotels in the city, I don't know) Oddly enough, some of the hotel staff acts like, they are making you a favor to let you stay there. Room rates = 2 x the level of service you expect from a hotel charging these room rates. Room rates = 1,3 x the comfort & technology of rooms. .", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOkay hotel as a base- if you dont mind noise/small rooms\u201d", "Author": "Jeann24", "ReviewID": "UR108511515", "Content": "From the airport: Easy to get to hotel from the airport- Just hop on the train to central station (ticket 4.20 each brought at station)from the airport then once at central station get the number 9 tram to plantage kerklann. We brought a four day travel pass for the trams only 19.50 Euros! (brought outside central station in one of the tourist shops) so cheap compared to london! the tram stops on the same road as the hotel then jst wall down the road and its there. Location: Ideally located if you want to keep away from noise etc at night but close to everything. About 10-15 minute walk to dam square or just get on the number 9 tram takes only 5 mins. Good location overall. Opposite the ZOO and next to a small park. Arrived at the Eden Lancaster hotel about 1pm told rooms would not be ready for another hour and a half or so, receiptionist offerd the use of a luggage room to keep our bags as we set of for a few hours till room ready. Finally got in room and was quite disappointed- as opend our door and door hit the bed which was right up against the window additionally toilet door was right next to bed! tiny room that couldnt even walk around the room! I know Amsterdam hotels rooms are known to be small but this was ridicoulous! Also the noise of the tram going ding ding ding every 3 minuites i kknew would drive me crazy- so went back to reception and asked for another room. The man kindly gave us another room with no fuss. Second room a little bit better, we could actually walk around the room and no noise as room was positioned at the back of the hotel overlooking residential flats. Only same problem was the bathroom! it is right next the the bed and there is a step up and their is a big gap invetween the door and floor- so you have to be pretty close to your travell companion as you hear everything! The room was a proper double bed which was nice for a change in european hotels! comfy too with good pillows! the bathroom was only a shower with hairdryer but very small and could do with updating. Additionally as mentioned in other reviews the carpet was really filthy! The hotel does do breakfast but this was 15 euros each and we didnt try it. along the road there are loads of lovely little cafes which did some smashing scrambled eggs! or go to Rambrant square where there are loads of restraunts and cafes from breakfast to dinner lovely sitting outside tables. The hotel as wireless internet that we could only acces from the reception area. On check out had to pay the city tax which for 4 days was arounf 14 euros. Recommded trips: Definatly recommend visting the de hortus botanical gardens only around the corner (1 tram stop) only 7.50 euro entry and you could if ya like spend all day in there! was gorgeous loads to see. Also recommed doing the pizza cruise at 7pm takes you around all the canals for 1 half hours and you order a dominos pizza and hagen daz ice cream and its deliverds to the boat! Also Van gough museum was very good. Loads of other weird and wacky things to see.

Maybe a bell will solve this problem, or just do the paper work in the front, it will help to improve security for the customers and staff. Also i tought that the check in introduction was very poor, my advice is a friendly smile at the arrival and then ask the customer if they need any maps, or any information about local ameneties. Also, they are missing an upsell oppourtunity by not offering any excursions through the hotel, i instead had to arrange and pay for these myself. Being a stranger to the area, i would have liked to have been offered these by the hotel instaead of arranging them through vendors that i was unfamiliar with.

The room was always kept warm with heating on which was a blessing as it was freezing in Amsterdam it was that cold on wednesday that it snowed! My only negative to the actual bedroom area was that the carpet seemed quite dirty and had quite a few stains so I was pleased that I brought my slippers with me!

Oh and one more thing please beware the price of things in Amsterdam are quite expensive in the centre due to the euro and being a tourist!

The Eden Lancaster is located a 10 minute walk from where the action is happening (or a very expensive tram). Being that it's off the strip and across the street from the zoo, it was completely silent. - Price: We paid ~$75USD a night. Can't beat that in such an expensive city. - Free Wi-Fi and a free computer in the lobby . - Breakfast: Delicious... but see below. Cons: - Rooms: The size of the room was comical. From sitting on the bed, you can touch all walls with your feet. The bathroom was an even more hilarious. While sitting on the toilet, your knees will touch the wall. To brush your teeth, you'll have to open the door. And, the shower is so small that you can't lift your arms without knocking into the wall or curtain. - Breakfast: Long story short, we asked the breakfast attendant if breakfast was free; she said it was. We said, \"Great!\" and chowed down every morning. When we went to checkout, the front desk told us we owed $15 euro per person per day. I explained to him that we were told it was free, to which he responded, \"but it wasn't.\" I told him that wasn't my problem and I wasn't paying him. This went on for about 10 minutes, and I stood my ground (like any good New Yorker). Finally, after his failed attempt at offering me 50% off, he said, \"fine.\" - Service: The people at the front desk were not very nice. They didn't greet you with a smile, didn't want to be bothered, and had to Google simple things like \"where's a pancake house.\" - Parking: At over $40 Euro a day to park on the street, my Belgian friend parked way down the street in a public lot for free.

After one night in this place we were decided to leave and on checking-out we were taken nevertheless another sum (higher than it was stated in confirmation blank) and the receptionist was very surprised on our earlier departure on which he noticed, that we CAN NOT TO LEAVE EARLIER AND MUST STAY FOR 2 NIGHTS MORE!!!!

The location was quiet and rooms were suitably sound-proofed from outside noise. Check-in and check-out was relatively quick and efficient. On the negative side, the bathroom seemed a little basic for a purported 3* hotel. As others have said, the carpet and fittings were also in need of a bit of attention. The hotel seemed to have recently been owned by Best Western. My take on this was that BW recognised that the hotel was in need of renovation and so sold it on rather than make the investment. Eden seem to be trying to milk the cow with a minimum of investment - and it's starting to show. Our main issue with the hotel was the interior noise. We were positioned at the foot of the stairs which ring out with the clunk of heels at all hours (this being a lively 24 hour city). The stairs seemed particularly steep and I did wonder if elderly people could negotiate them easily - which did give me some concern in the event of a fire.

First of all: Amsterdam is a great place to go on a holiday, very clean city with lots of places to visit. Now for the hotel: before the trip I already had a few questions about the arrangment and some practical stuff. I received very detailed and clear information in no time, making it very easy to plan everything. Also during our stay in the hotel, the staff was very friendly and helpfull, giving various tips to make the best of our citytrip! The location of the hotel is just across the Artis zoo, what makes the hotel very accessible by public transport. When you go out of the hotel you have 2 tram stations in an area of 100m, with a straight line to the touristic places in Amsterdam (Waterlooplein, Damplein, Rembrandtplein,...). It's about 5minutes travel by tram, 20minutes walk to the very center of Amsterdam. In the arrangement there was a 48h free public transport for my girlfriend and I included, so we could use it without any further cost, very handy! The hotel is nice and clean, just as the rooms. Every day they come by for making up bed, new towels and so, no complaints about that. The breakfast was also included and was nice and tasty with 4 or 5 staff people cleaning everything up. The hotel is in the quiet part of Amsterdam, just next to a small but beautiful park. There are several tea-rooms, coffee-houses and restaurants near the hotel. One negative point: the size of the bathroom. Very small (but very clean though!), but that's the consideration you have to make I guess.

We were on the main floor with a window that opened up on to an alley and loud traffic was never an issue. I give the location a five for quiet and a 3 for proximity to central ams. If we were unable to find something in our price range closer to central AMS, yeah, I would stay here again.", "Date": "February 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cComfortable hotel - did what it said on the tin\u201d", "Author": "Madtabby", "ReviewID": "UR54359783", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for 5 days in January with husband and mother in law.

Then it pretty much goes down hill from here. We stayed in room 404 and we were presented with the smallest hotel room i've stayed in. Upon booking i specifically requested a double/queen size bed. What we got were 2 twin beds pushed together, which is fine, but instead of a double duvet which would make perfect sense, we were given 2 very thin single duvets?! I've not experienced this before, so assumed a mistake was made. My girlfriend highlighted this to reception only to be told they have no double duvets, just single only. I've also emailed the Eden hotel group about this and they say that this is policy across their chain of hotels! With such a policy i don't understand of providing double beds in the first place. Even worse, upon removing the top sheet of bedding we found stains under the next layer. As it was well below 0 outside i requested blankets for the room as their thin, thin duvets were just simply not good enough. I was eventually accomodated with blankets by the reception. The ensuite bathroom is literally arms lengh. The shower is of good warmth and power but it doesn't have shower doors, instead it has a shower curtain and because the shower is so small, soon this curtain is wrapped around you which can not only be claustrophobic but also quite yucky considering how often will this shower curtain actually be cleaned if the sheets are anything to go by!! Also, because the walls are so thin, we were lucky enough to be able to hear every noise and conversation made from our neighbours. After we had checked out, we realised we had left a mobile phone behind so returned to the hotel after 30 minutes. We advised reception what had happened, and they contacted the maid staff who had already started to clean the room to check for it. After 20 minutes of waiting they finally phoned back to say it wasn't there. I asked if i could look and within 10 seconds of going into the room, the phone was on the floor right in front of me. The poor eyesite of the cleaning staff may explain how they miss out stains on sheets! Plus points of the hotel - it has free use of an internet pc in reception. The number 9&14 are just outside the door to take you into the city centre...and thats about it.

We found the hotel to be more than adequate for our requirements and whilst not being in the centre we found this was not a problem as it was only approx 15/20 minutes walk to Dam Square. The fact that it is out of the hub-bub was an advantage in our opinion, as the area is quiet and therefore there was little external noise at night with the exception of the trams passing below occasionally.

So, yes it's small, but it does the job so as long as you are aware of that and don't expect a massive luxurious bath to wallow in, you'll be fine.

Our experience there was just okay, but we did have a couple of problems. Location: The hotel is a very easy tram ride from Central Station. Just hop on Tram 9 and you reach the hotel in maybe six stops. It stops one short block away from the hotel so it's very convenient. It costs 1.6 Euro per person. The hotel is a very easy walk to the huge shopping areas, the Jewish museum, the Botanical Garden, the Artis Zoo, and a few other attractions. It takes a while longer to reach Dam Square, the Red Light District, and any of the other sights. I would say it was easily a mile or so to walk to any of those--very manageable if you are a big walker. It seemed like a safe, quiet area because it was far enough away from the main attractions. Check-in/Concierge: It was fine. We arrived just before noon. The only problem was that, during our three days there, there were very very few times when people would be out at the concierge desk. It often looked deserted. They did have a large bell that needed to be rung because it seemed like most of the employees chose to stay in a room in the back for the majority of the day. When we had questions, it always seemed like we were bothering or interrupting them from being in the back room. Also, we had some questions about taxis and airport shuttles, and the employees gave us some incorrect information--which surprised me because I figured that it was something they should know. Room: It was on the small size but it was nicely decorated in modern-looking and sparse furniture. There only seemed to be room for the closet and the bed, but that is fine if you don't plan on spending too much time in the room anyway. Not too much room for luggage! The room did contain many great magazines on Amsterdam; some of them had coupons with savings for tourists, which was nice. The room was cleaned every day and kept in good condition. The bed did sink lower on the side toward the bathroom. Bathroom: The bathroom was the biggest problem for me because it was tiny. Two people could definitely not fit into it. The toilet ran every time it was flushed, and we found ourselves jiggling the flusher every time until it stopped running. In fact, it was running when we first checked into the room. I never quite got the hang of it even after three days. Also, the light stopped working on the first day we were there. We called in about it and someone came in and jiggled the light a few times before it started working again. Breakfast: It was nice that the breakfast service was available for long hours. They did a nice job, offering a good mixture of hot and cold items. They had things like pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. Amenities: The books in the room said that free internet was available in the hotel lobby, but the computer was broken the entire time we were there so we never got to take advantage of it. The wireless available in the lobby was also very slow.

There was a lift at the back that went part way down but then there was another half flight of stairs. The room was at the front of the hotel so we had bars on the window and a view of knees as people walked by. Being under reception we also had quite a bit of noise between the street and hotel patrons until midnight or so then it dropped off. Still noisy,but not unbearable. The bathroom was not in the best of repair. Some of the trim was falling off and the tiling was old and slightly damaged in the shower. It just didn't feel like it belonged in the same hotel. The bed was comfortable though, and the room was well designed. For one night it was OK. If we had been staying another night I would have requested a different room.

The tram costs 1.6 euros and it is valid for one hour only. From the central station I took a taxi to the hotel which costs 20 euros. I took a standard double room booked from the hotel website, the room is good for only two persons, if you have kids then you need a bigger room, there is almost enough space to walk to the other side of the bed. The room has a toilet next to a sink next to a shower all inclined in one row \u00e2\u20ac\u0153compact design\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which will be perfect if you are in an airplane not a hotel. There is no shower gel so you have to bring your own, they provide with the room a small soap near the sink to wash your hands and excellent two pairs of towels for the face and body. The shower is perfect however you should be careful the HOT water is extremely hot so if you have kids they have to be supervised when using the shower or the sink. The room is clean and comfortable you can have a good night sleep here without interruptions or noise since the area is quite at night. There is a small safe in the room located in the closest which is enough for valuables to keep. If you have kids then be careful when leaving them alone at night watching the TV \u00e2\u20ac\u0153local channels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is not PG anymore even the free channels are not for kids, maybe possible to lock these channels at the reception desk. There is no mini bar so you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cool your water or other beverages you have. However, there is a vending machine in the lobby that offers cool water and other beverages.

For dry cleaning and washing your clothes, I used the clean center near the Heineken factory they charge per kilo for washing and for ironing they charge extra however they are very cheap compared to the hotel rates for dry cleaning. To reach the clean center take tram 10 after you walk south from the hotel leave the zoo to your left and walk until you find the tram 10 stop and then take tram 10 and stop at weteringschans then walk south until you reach the Heineken building and then you find the clean center on the Fredbolstr. Street. Finally, the windows should be left open to have air refreshes the room and during night you have to leave the windows open since it gets hot in the room without AC but be careful to switch any lights so to avoid mosquito entering your room.

The hotel is located near the Artis Zoo on a moderately quiet street. My room faced the street and the first thing I noticed was the trams that pass the hotel all day. Luckily, the windows are thick and cut out a lot of the noise. The room that I was in was very small and had barely enough room to store my luggage. The bathroom was as small as it could be, maybe 6 ft by 3 feet, but spotlessly clean. There is a safe in the room and a television mounted to the wall. The room lighting was good and for Amsterdam it was well ventilated and seemed to be well insulated. Also, there is a convenient elevator for use. The breakfast was probably the highlight of my hotel stay. It was very good and had about everything you could imagine, from yoghurt and fruit, to a variety of rolls and bread, to cold cuts and cheeses and cereals. There is a nice coffee/espresso machine as well as a juice dispenser which also included a strange orange colored \"vitamin\" drink which doesn't do much for a hangover. Speaking of that, beer in a Dutch restaurant runs e4.50 for a pint sized choice so a nice option is to walk to Waterlooplein, about 10 minutes away, where you'll find a large supermarket (Albert Heijn). The supermarket has a wide variety of beer for a fraction of what you would pay in a restaurant. This is the lead in for the low point of my hotel stay. I went out for the day and left 3 beers in a bag. When I came back to the room, the bag was gone and one beer was left on the dresser. Point of that is, if you have anything of value and you can fit it in the hotel safe, don't hesitate to do so. Now that I ripped the house keepers, I do want to say that they changed the towels and made the bed every day during my 5 day stay so I thought of the missing beers as a sort of tip. On to reception. The check -n was great. The room was ready when I arrived at 10:30 a.m. The nightstaff at reception were aloof, on the other hand, but I didn't have to deal with them that much. The hotel is quite far from most of the action. If you are a walker, like me, then the only thing you have to worry about is the elements. January is actually a good time to go to Amsterdam but it certainly does rain. One good thing about the hotel's location is the nearby restaurants. Like a previous poster, I also recommend Pasta Villa, located one block toward Waterlooplein. It has good, reasonably priced Italian food. Another good thing about the location is that there are plenty of small convenience stores near the hotel. The area is quiet and has a safe feeling. I saw parents with children out and about, something that you eerily don't see much of in most other parts of the city. Other than the zoo, another unique, closeby and must see attraction to visit is the Flea Market at Waterlooplein on Sundays. The hotel is a bit of a hike from Centraal Station. It took me about 30 minutes but if you aren't into walking there is a tram stop less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel. All in all, I would stay at this hotel again.

Easy to get to. We then took a taxi to the Hotel, it was 13 euro. The Hotel is located to the south side of the zoo, about a 20 - 30 minute walk to the centre of the city. Nice to dander into town on a dry evening. However, we bought 3 day tram passes at reception, 13 euro each, so we could hop on and off as we pleased. This suited us fine, as we returned to the hotel at teatime before going out for the night. A taxi back to the hotel after 11pm cost us less than 10 euro on each occasion we used one. We arrived at check-in time, to be advised that our rooms were not quite ready. We were dealt with politely and were able to check-in after a 15 minute wait. The bedrooms are small, about 3m x 3m, and the ensuite is tiny - about 1m x 2m. So previous reviews are accurtate in that respect. I'm on the large side myself, 6'2\" and I had no issue accessing or using the facilities - just know to expect this. The bedroom facilities, as with any Best Western, are pretty good, including free room safe, multi channel tv, phone and internet (though we did not use this). The bathroom did not have a facecloth. Besides being well equipped, our rooms had views over a small park, and were clean apart from some minor marks on the carpet. We did not have breakfast as we were never up in time and it was 14 euro extra. Plenty of dining options around and about, typically less than 10 euro for a full cooked breakfast. We took evening meals in and around Amsterdam, and found it to be priced a little on the higher side than at home in Northern Ireland, so as a city break destination I suppose it compared fairly favourably. There is no bar facility in the Hotel, so drinks were purchased from a vending machine when we returned in the evenings and fancied a night cap. The staff were helpful and well presented. Amsterdam itself is a pretty city with a very continental, cosmopolitan feel. Lots and lots of canals, more than you might imagine, look out for the cyclists and listen for their bells - get out of their way because they will not stop if you are walking in a cycle lane. Check out the shops around \"9 streets\", and the open minded should take an early evening walk around the RLD - just to see what goes on. It really is mad. Be careful though; plan your way and look after your belongings as there are some undesireables hanging around. We had a great break, even though we stayed three nights we could have used another couple, so we will return another time.
