In such a small room right by the heating pipes we were absolutely sweltering. Fortunately the windows opened to allow a little draft but the heat was to much and made for very uncomfortable nights sleep. When we mentioned to reception they just shrugged. The other sleep disturber is the noisy hotel staff. Woke us every morning shouting to each other, slamming doors.

We had a stand up shower only, no bath, and the shower did tend to flood the bathroom floor no matter how careful we were so we used our towels to mop things up. We got fresh towels every day though. It had a hair dryer that worked well, so I was glad I hadn't wasted space packing one. We were on the 4th floor, through one of the hall doorways then down a hall. We were confused the first few times up and down, but finally figured it out. They served the included breakfast from 7-10 in a separate breakfast room. It was more substantial then I expected (having only been to France and given just croissants for breakfast). There were scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon. Fresh salami and cheeses, sweet breads, delicious yogurts and cereals. The coffee was from a push button machine and not too good. That was surprising. Other then that, I found the breakfast adequate to start the day off sightseeing. The location was very good, not hard to find and centrally located and within walking distance to a lot of the major sites.

Raphael one of the guys on the door was the friendliest and most helpfully person I have ever come across working in a hotel. He was fantastic throughout our stay and couldn't have been more helpful. The second person working was the rudest person I ever came across I think his dad must own the hotel or something there is no way any hotel would hire this guy. There was a really old fashioned lift that was very cool too. The breakfast was really great here too there was as much eggs, cold meats, cereals and bread that you could eat. There was also a room to keep luggage when we checked out. All in all this was a good hotel and I would stay here again for sure.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rostrevor", "Title": "\u201cSuperb location and very helpful!\u201d", "Author": "NicolaQRostrevor", "ReviewID": "UR116473002", "Content": "I chose this hotel for its location as we were only staying in Rome for 3 days and wanted to see all the key attractions.

It was a 5-10 minute walk to Trevi Fountain, Piazza Venezia, Colesseum & Roman Forum and well connected by bus to Termini Station and the Vatican (Bus no 64 or 40 express). The hotel is located just off the Via Nazionale which is full of shops, cafes etc. We had a standard double room with a lovey view of the Roman Forum and all the rooftops of Rome. It was a little noisy outside so if you left your window open you may not sleep but we were so tired from a days sightseeing that it wasnt a problem for us. Our room had air con too which was much needed as it was 26 degrees out! Our room was cleaned and towels changed every day. The guys on the reception desk were very helpful with any of our queries and check in and check out were very efficient. The breakfast room was lovely and served a good selection of pastries, toast, jams, cold meats, cheeses, cereals etc. If you're getting the bus anywhere in Rome you must purchase a bus ticket for 1euro before getting on the bus, as you cannot pay cash to the driver. You can get the tickets in any tobacconists. Get to the Vatican early to avoid the queues or else go with a tourguide which can bypass the queue but you will pay a little extra for this privilege. it is well worth it though, our guide was fantastic. We went to the Colesseum in the evening, 1 hour before closing time which was great as the crowds had gone and it was beautiful during the sunset. Anyone wishing to go up to see the Olympic Stadium to see an A.S. Roma football game, you get the 910 bus from Termini Station but you get your match tickets from the club shop which is in the Piazza Colonna (off the Via del Corso). You must bring your passport with you to obtain a ticket, and also to the game. Eating out in Rome was expensive in the main piazzas like Piazza Navona, so i would advise anyone to go to the little side streets off these piazzas where you will find traditional family run Trattorias which are better value and the food is beautiful.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, good breakfast, and friendly helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "April_Mexico_bride", "ReviewID": "UR106681448", "Content": "My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Hotel Hiberia.

We traveled with 3 children and were allowed to stay in a quadruple and they had no problem allowing my 3 year old to stay free with the existing bedding. That was great since a room for 5 is very hard to find in Europe. The shower in our room was terrible. Our was a hand held sprayer that you had to hold it couldnt be left on the wall or it would spray straight out into the bathroom. They have a 2 paneled glass door to the shower which doesnt surround the tub completely so water gets everywhere. The elevator to get to the room is a very old cage elevator. Its a little scary at first but we didnt have any problems. The staff was very friendly except for one man ( not sure of his name) . It seemed like we were bothering him with anything we needed. The internet wasnt working in the rooms when we checked in.We checked in on Sunday and he said it would be up by the next day. Tuesday night at 9pm the internet finally worked.

This tour was supposed to show us St Peter's Basilica and tombs, but when we got through the museum Luigi showed us where to go and left, obviously on his way for next Tour. When in the Sistine Chapel we got 10 minutes max to enjoy the paintings before being rushed out, not near long enough.

We should say that we never booked for breakfast at the hotel and so cannot comment on its quality. All that mattered to us was that the hotel was central and it most certainly was. We travelled to the hotel using the train from the airport to the Termini station and taxi from there. We later discovered that if we had contacted the hotel in advance we could have booked a chauffeur driven car to take us directly from the airport to the hotel for less than the public transport route had cost. We actually used this service for our return journey to the airport and highly recommend it. The hotel itself is a little rough around the edges but very clean and the staff on the desk were absolutely brilliant. Our room had everything we needed - and most importantly for two girls who don't travel light, ample storage space for all our belongings. The room had air-con and we had no issues at all with the unit or noise from the street (Via XXIV Maggio). The location is fantastic and within the first day and a half had seen/stumbled across several of the main landmarks and piazzas without having strayed very far at all. The vatican is about a mile away but it is easy to navigate your way by foot which gives you more opportunities to find the many hidden gems in Romes backstreets. We never had to use public transport after our arrival. Walking was fantastic and helped you to get your bearings but sensible shoes are a must as the terrain varies greatly. The friendliness and helpfullness of the Hotel Hiberia staff were a high point of our holiday. They did all the stressful jobs for us from booking tours and transport to making reservations and reccomending authentic restaurants and entertainments and their familiarity with all the guests made it a much more personal experience rather than feeling like just another tourist.

Why is it that hotels never cater for the basics like somewhere to put toothbrush and shaving kit and makeup for the other half. There was a good shower, but the horror was the stink of bad plumbing / sewers. This spoilt what could have been a reasonable stay. The bed was as comfortable and large as any I have slept in, and compensated to a small degree on the smell which we mitigated by leaving the window open. The air con never worked anyway! The room had a flat screen tele, but as is so often the case in Italy there were no English channels. Not even CNN or other American news channel let alone the BBC. Do they think only Italians visit Rome? The best feature of the hotel was its location. It really was central to all the sites and everything was walkable. We did all the main attractions, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Colloseum, Forum, Pantheon and Vatican City; all by foot and non further than 30 minutes (Vatican). Another feature was the ease to get to the hotel from the Airport. We took the Airport bus to the Tremini and walked down Via Nationale to our hotel (15 minutes). We were unlucky enough to be in a room next to a baby which cried several times in the night each night and I would willingly have strangled the parents who seemed to be ...... prats. This and the smell lowered my enjoyment of the hotel, but if we had been more sensible and asked for another room I am sure they would have accomodated us. But we, being typically British and stoic, did not complain. I feel bad about that, because I should have and I am sure if I was American, I would have in which case everything would have been better. Would I stay there again?

The bathroom was quite large and had every amenity we could want, including heated towels. The floors were a lovely tile and the most important thing is the room was exceptionally clean. The maid service came in every morning and refreshed what we needed. The windows in the room sound proofed the outside and we never heard street noise. The interior walls are so thick that you don't hear people next door or in the corridors. Dino, who was at the front desk every night, helped us out immensely by offering restaurants and itineraries.

They are down the block from their \"White House\". The location is within a 10 min walk to Trevi Fountain, the Spanish steps, Pantheon a bit further. The opposite direction, like a 10 min stroll to the Collesium. A walk to Vatican City is 30-35 min if you don't stroll. If hoofing it isn't your cup of American coffee, then the bus stop is just a 3 min walk from the front door of this hotel, where bus 64 will take you along the main drag to Campo Fiori or Vatican City, or the opposite direction to Termini Station. As for the Hotel itself, please people, remember this is Rome, where some buildings have been standing for centuries, not the Hyatt Resort in Maui. The hotel somewhat sits away from the corner of the street. As you face the hotel, there is a small alley on the left and part of a church complex build directly next to it. The doors automatically open when you enter (nice with having luggage) and directly to your right is the reception desk. The reception/bar area is all new looking, and pleasant. The staff working the front desk, I will have to say were 100 percent very warm, personalble and hospitable. Check-in was a snap. We were given room 101 on the lowest floor which was fine for us. The stairs/lift were directly across from our room door. We reserved a double standard room. The room was renovated, and the double bed consisted of two beds pushed together, we didn't even notice that was the case. The bed was extremely comfortable. It had a closet, along with end tables, vanity and tv set, whether it worked or not, was insequiencal, as neither one of us turned it on the entire 4 day stay while there. The room had a window, with shutters, which I immediately opened, and it looked out into the building next door, and the alley. This did not disappoint me in one bit, as I don't stay at a hotel to sit and watch the view. The room had a very well functioning airconiditoner which we used off and on along with opening the window at night to let the cool Rome night air in. (I hate hotels where you can't open the window). The bath room, is like in a small closet! LOL. I am 5-11, and a body builder, at 220lbs. The hot water worked, yes the shower stall was small, but I managed THIS IS ROME! I personally don't use bidets so they could of removed that, and would give the bath more room, but apparently, Europeans like their bidets. Ha. Ha. One thing that my partner had difficulty using was the in-room safe, which was faulty. The manger came in less than 5 min, and fixed it. As for the helpfulness of Hiberia Hotel staff....they couldn't of been nicer. We asked for directions to this, that or whatever, and they were very accomodating. The breakfast room was directly underneath, and entrance down and around the corner from our room. There is enough kind of breakfast foods that would please a wide variety of eaters. The scrambled eggs were tasty, the many pastiries, cereals, yogurts, friuit, etc. I always travel with my high protien oatmeal, and made use of the hot water. My only suggestion to the staff is that bacon/sausage should be cooked a bit longer than what they presented each day, but, even though I may prefer more crisp, solid bacon, Europeans have a different bent on cooking so, I lived with it. If I wanted bacon or sausage cooked the way I like it cooked, I'd be home in LA. So, I have no complaints. The coffee machine they have I would love to have here at home, the cappicinnos were the morning wake up of caffiene for me. Since were are airline employees, we use the internet a bit to check our schedules, and flight availability for standby travel. Next to the bar is an internet area, where they provided us access to the net. Hotel space in Rome was very, very tight, this particular weekend with the Holy Father Cannonizing 5 on Sunday (which was the purpose of our trip). The Hiberia was listed at like some 280.00 a night. I had frequent flyer miles and used them to pay for our hotel stay. If I had to pay that kind of rate, would I stay here? Probably not. I'm cheap, and probably wouldn't of even made the trip. But, the fact is, I did make the trip, and if it hadn't been for a busy weekend like this in Rome, the rates would of been more swallowable.

We didn't take any public transit or taxis while in Rome because we didn't have to. Hotel Hiberia has you in the centre of it all. Trevi Fountain 7-10 minutes walk, Circus Maximus 15 minutes, Pantheon 20 minutes, Coloseum 30 minutes and Piazza Venicia 5 minutes while Vatican City is about half an hour too. Do yourself a favour and be sure to visit the continental breakfast. Grab an extra hard boiled egg and some cheese with crackers and throw them in your backpack for snacks throughout the day! The only negative point was that during our stay the wireless internet was down but we found an internet cafe with the help of the front desk staff and it was cheap anyways. The front desk staff was wonderful and a great help when planning our days and finding our ways.

This hotel is in a good location and easy walking distance from Palazzo Quirinale (2 min), Trevi Fountain (10 min) , Le Quattro Fontane (10 mins) Piazza Barberini (15 min) Spanish Steps (20 min), Piazza Venezia (5 min), Il Vittoriano (5 min), Trajan's Column (5 min) and the Coliseum (10 min). I got a cab from Roma Termini Station which took about 10 mins and cost about 15 euro which I agreed to before I got into the cab. Be aware though that taxi drivers will try to take you for a ride and not in a good way (the cabbie tried to tell me initially it would cost 28 euro which was simply outrageous given the short distance from the station to the hotel). The hotel was much nicer than I expected for a 3 star and well worth the money I paid. The room was a good size for one person especially given the room next to mine was a fraction of the size and only had a single bed in it. It was clean and neat and while the heating was a little too warm at certain times of the day I was able to cool things down by opening the windows when necessary. It was perfect for me. The room amenities included a safe and fat screen TV with CNN for the English speakers and a minibar. There is also an internet point in the hotel bar which costs 1 euro for 12 minutes. The hotel lift is apparently original and 100 years old. I thought it was a charming touch although I overheard other guests bemoaning its size and efficiency. On the whole Reception staff were helpful with questions and recommendations although at times they seemed overwhelmed and a bit stressed. Breakfast was included in the tariff and is provided in the restaurant adjacent to the hotel. The buffet included juices (dispenser only) coffee (both dispenser and barista) and chilled water. A hot choice was provided of scrambled eggs, sausage links, bacon and toast. Cereals, canned fruit, yoghurt, fresh bread rolls, pastries, scones, muffins, rice cakes and a variety of packet crackers and cookies were also available. Sliced cheese and cold cuts were also available as well as cream cheese portions and preserves. The restaurant is also open for lunch and dinner most days (not for Saturday lunch and no service on public holidays) and while I ate there because as a lone traveler it was convenient (and safer than venturing out alone to look for something else) I was really disappointed with the food which was way below par. I\u2019m not sure though whether this reflects on the hotel in any way as they not have much say about the menu or the kitchen staff. If you choose to eat here in the evenings I do suggest you are prepared for a long wait as there seems to be only 2 wait staff who are utterly run off their feet which might explain their demeanor. I waited 30 minutes for my bill one evening once I had managed to gain their attention which also took quite a bit of doing. There is an excellent snack bar opposite the Hotel for take away lunches and snacks and a bar around the corner that has live music most nights. Overall for a three star hotel this place was a real find, and a comfortable place to stay that was close to most things.

Breakfast was fine, self service, with usual pastries, meats and cheese plus sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs. It was served in the restaurant which on an evening serves pizzas. The mini bar was reasonable at 2 euros for a bottle of water/coke etc. I spent hours looking for the right hotel and I believe I found it, very clean, friendly and no need to take a bus or tube train anywhere. Took advice and booked tickets for Coliseum online, on arrival it is chaotic and unorganised. You have to go to the front of both lines and hand in your pass to receive your tickets (couter is on the right). The line on the right is for couples etc whilst the line on the left is for groups. The line for Vatican museums and Sistine Chapel is even longer however on reflection I think everyone arrives early (as suggested in the guide book). We waited 2 hours, from 9.30, however when we came out at 1pm it was raining and NOBODY was in a queue. If you want to see the Sistine Chapel then avoid Vatican City and Saint Peters (visit here afterwards). When you arrive at Saint Peters Square head east (right through the pillars) along a main street with shops etc (Via di Porta Angelica) eventually you will see some signs on lamp posts.

The hotels location is quite central to most of the tourist spots (Trevi, Forum, Coleseum). The rooms are narrow & small, but I beleive this is par for the course in Rome.

We had breakfast in the room the first morning which consisted of a lot of breads, croissants, cheese, jam & coffee. I cannot comment on the breakfast room as we tended to hit the cafes on our morning excursions. The hotel also has a tiny little bar that you can get cocktails, spirits or coffee but it is not always manned. We used it once just before it closed at midnight. You're better off going to some of the local cafe bars in the vicinty if you want a late drink. We never tried the restaurant attached to the hotel although the menu did look good. There was a fabulous local restaurant around the corner called the Lantern where all the locals seem to go. As to the sight seeing, we found Discover Rome tours (english speaking) an excellent bunch of people and very informative. You usually find them outside the Coleseum and they have 4 or 5 really good tours at a reasonable price.

Bad points: The room was incredibly laughably small. There was hardly any room to walk around the bed. In fact we had to crawl over it to get passed each other. The room itself was a bit dark, and unless you sat down on the seat in the shower it was liable to flood the bathroom. The only english news channel on the tele was Fox news... Generally Rome, and indeed Italy, is very expensive for what you get. I paid over 200 Euro a night for this hotel. For what you would get at home the standard is incomparable.

Ive been to rome three times and the hotels are pretty much all like this unless you stay out a little further from the centre. I think alot of western europeans and american first time rome explorers expect the same service as we would get at home. Its not like that.

At the vatican, arrive at St. Peters for 9:00 or so and climb to the dome before you see inside the church 4. Villa Borgese is great for picnic 5. Cafe Greco for a coffee, street opposite the Spanish Steps.

I arrived 4 hours earlier than planned, and after being invited back to the coffee bar for a refreshment (Danilo - the owner - makes the best capuccino in Rome!), and more waiting, they decided to assign a different room and had me checked in by 11:00 am. The double room was very cool, clean, spacious, and included A/C. I was a solo traveller, but the hotel had numerous families with children. I chose the hotel because of location - 15 minutes to Coloseo; Trevi, Pantheon, Spanish Steps; 5 minutes to the Roman Forum, Trajan's Column and Market; and just down the street from the Presidential Palace.

The location of the hotel is indeed terrific as it is central to most of the ancient part of Rome and all of the major attractions. The staff is for the most part fluent in English and can help quite easily with directions, checking in and checking out. Recommendations for restaurants resulted in one great suggestion and one poor one (After which we went off on our own). Directions on getting buses was poor, but they are very efficient at getting cabs on short notice. The rooms are clean and generally well furnished. Our major problem was that we arrived to find that the two deluxe rooms (with individual bathrooms) that we had reserved were not available and instead were given the standard rooms which are tiny and shared one bathroom. We were moved the next day to Deluxe rooms, but were not given much of a refund for the difference in the rooms the first night. This was in spite of confirmatory emails from the travel agency and the hotel itself. We had to argue for a refund of the difference in price of the rooms. Then, when we checked out, the manager tried to charge us about 300 Euros more than the agreed on price for the 5 nights, until I pulled out the email with the confirmed price. The breakfast was the worst we had in Italy (we had great food in the other two hotels). Coffee was bitter and from a machine, the meats were warm and did not seem fresh.
