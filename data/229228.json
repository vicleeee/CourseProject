But, bizarrely, our booking wasn't on their system, and it took them a good hour to figure out what had happened. We'd booked through Hotels.com, which seemed to really confuse them! We had to send the woman at reception copies of the emails we received as confirmation of the booking, and even on receipt of these they still didn't understand. Anyway, they had no rooms for us, so we were taken to NH Caransa, their 'sister' hotel. It wasn't much of a looker from the outside, and was situated over the top of a bar/cafe. I was a bit disheartened, but I had no reason to be! We were given a choice of a regular or quiet room, and after reading the reviews about noise in the square, decided to go for the quiet room. And that is was! We stayed in room 208, which was small, but perfectly formed - very clean, with a huge, comfortable bed, huge desk, TV, guide books etc. No noise could be heard at all on Friday or Saturday night, and even the air con was fantastically quiet. I was pleased they were able to accommodate us, with no extra charge. Breakfast on both days was delicious! They had pretty much anything you could think of - the sausages and mini-pancakes were great! Lovely dining room, with a balcony overlooking the square. Reception staff were friendly and welcoming, and we were given fresh towels and new toiletries on each day, which I thought was very generous. Overall I can't fault this hotel, and I was actually glad of the mix up come the end of our stay!

We were initially given a room that was very small. We requested something else, and the staff were very friendly and gave us a different room. The staff were very pleasant and helpful at all times. BUT, the hotel is located right on Rembrandtplein, which is the 2nd most popular square in Amsterdam. We wish we knew this before hand. It was very nice to walk to the restaurants around the square and within a block or so. However, the locals and tourists come and just sit and hang out in the square. They love to visit the \"coffee shop\" across the square and then smoke their purchases in the square. With it being July, we had to open the window for ventilation. However, it wouldn't have mattered. One night we chose to be hot and get some sleep and closed the window. It still sounded like the party was in our room. The noise is constant until around 1 AM when the restaurants close. If we were lucky, we got a couple of hours of quiet. The noise then started back up again between 4 and 5 AM when the clubs were closing. We would finally get some sleep after 6 AM when the only noise was the very loud street trains and the trash trucks cleaning up the square. Amsterdam young men, who ride motorcycles, find it amusing to rev their motorcycles at 4 AM, which then causes all of the scooter alarms to go off. OMG, one night we actually had around 75 motorcycles from Hells Angels Amsterdam in the square, which brought about 20 police officers with them. Now, on the other hand, if you are a partier, who likes to be in the center of everything, and be about a 10 min walk from pretty much everything, then this is the place for you. Lastly, when you think Internet at this place, think back to the old dial up access days.

One thing I found is that, from the front desk staff to the breakfast room waitors and cleaning ladies, I've never seen the same face more than twice during my stay. I'll list a few things to explain how they are untrained: Internet: I requested to purchase the wireless internet pass from the reception but the password and login name appeard to be invalid, so I went back to the front desk. They gave me a new one and asked me to retry, and so I did, but again failed. When I went back again, there were few more people with the same problems talking to the reception staff, and this guy just told me, \"we have asked the technical people to look into it, hopefully it would be fixed soon.\" The funny thing is, I later found out that there were small letters of expiration date on the internet pass, so the reason that we can't log in is because all the pass are expired, but of course none of them bothered to check. they just phoned the technical people and made it someone else's problem. Even more funny thing is that the second time I required internet pass, there's a different lady at front desk, again gave me one of the expired internet pass sheet, means the previous guy didn't even bother to pass on this tiny problem to his colleagues. Housekeeping:The room is extrmely dusty. They make the bed and change the towels, but the tables and the closets are very dusty. And they either forgot to give the shampoo or the complimentary instant coffee and tea. Breakfast buffet: You will need to wake up early enough to see the food. Sometimes if I went after 9:00(closed at 10:30), most of the food is gone, especially the pastry. And I think they are very often understaff, 'cause quite a few times I found the tables coverd in crumb. And this morning they didn't even bother to set the table anymore, everyone had to grab their own cutlery and napkin. I actually saw this poor guy got yelled at by the waitress. He asked her for something and she replied impatiently,\"Yes, just one moment ok? I am busy with the buffet, yeah?\" Several times I was chased after by staff asking me to sign for the bill while I had plate full of food and coffee in both hands.

Or, I stayed in 508-a very comfortable room with a nice view! The buffet breakfast was more than we could handle, such a choice of food.

The hotel is self is located between two bars/pubs and can get a little loud if you book a room facing the square. I usually stay during the week and have little or no problems with the noise. The rooms have all been renovated and are tastefully decorated. During all my stays , 5 so far, the rooms have been clean and staff have been most helpful. The bathroom can sometimes be on the small side depending on which room you book. During one of my stays I was given a room at the back of the hotel with shower instead of the usual shower/bath. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it a problem as I usually just shower anyway. Internet access (wifi) is hosted by Swisscom and in my opinion is way too expensive. The hotel offers use of the terminal in the lobby but I have never used it and am unable to state the rate they charge. I usually opt for my blackberry for my incidental web browsing.

NH Caransa is right in Rembrantplein. Its literally in the square. You don't really get a sense of this when you visit the NH website. So what does that mean for you? The good is that is a pretty major stop for the trams which are great public transportation in the city. Its also pretty centrally located. About a 20 min walk to Central Station, 20 mins to Leidesplein and Museumplein, very close to Spui. Bad news, there are tons of restaurants, neon lights and a huge TV screen. Think a small New York Times Square. So its bright and noisy. If you are a light sleeper, beware. Or ask for a side street or rear facing room. Its not perfect but its better. Inside, its very new and modern and pretty much looks like the pictures on the NH website. It was surprisingly big (we got a room with two twin beds pushed together) for a european room. The original room we were assigned with a single queen was a bit small so we asked for a room change. I think the room sizes can vary. The room is clean and well decorated. The bathroom is large, new and spacious. Alongside the beds, they have these great reading lights. The project a small light for reading and attached to a metal \"snake\" cord that you can manipulate to the angle of your choice. The ONLY thing that was strange was the bathtub/shower didn't have a proper shower curtain. It has this glass half door so for most people the water will splatter and the floor can get wet. A very small inconvenience. The room has a built in safe for valuables. Also, given everything else its so modern, the TVs are still the old style tubes but not a big deal. The staff was very friendly and gave my daughter a kid's kit of puzzles and art supplies. Our room fee was still pretty expensive but that is also largely due to the exchange rate these days which is pretty terrible for US travelers. The fee (for us) included free breakfast in the restaurant. The selection was pretty good although the hot food was a bit bland. Still plenty of fruit, cereals, jams as well as your standard eggs, sausages, bacon, etc. I'd consider staying here again as long as our room was a bigger one and not facing the main square. The location is hard to beat and its is well kept.", "Date": "November 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cDefinately recommend this hotel...\u201d", "Author": "icklep", "ReviewID": "UR10486446", "Content": "I am just back from a three night stay in this hotel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I booked the hotel only a few days before going but we still had a lovely room. It was very modern with a mini bar which didn't charge you everytime you moved something which was handy because you could buy your own drinks and put them in the mini bar. Our room was quite small probably because we booked late but it had a lovely window which practically took up the whole of one wall. We were on the third floor at the back of the hotel overlooking houses... being at the back worked out perfectly... it was so quiet even at the weekend... so if you want no noise whatsoever book a room at the back of the hotel. One thing that bugged me was we had no iron or ironing board in the room... I went down to reception and told them and within seconds there was an iron and an ironing board in the room. The air conditioning also was always on I couldn't get it off but it didn't affect us so it was grand. Oh ya one major thing that I think the hotel could easily rectify is to put a full a full lenght mirror in the room... I found this annoying but at least there was one in the lift. The bathroom was very small but it was absolutely spotless and the shower was one of the best I have ever used... very powerful. The bathroom products were amazing there was a hairbrush, a comb, a toothbrush kit, a shaving kit, a sponge, an exfoliating pad, soaps and designer shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. Even if you had just used one thing once they gave you another new one the next day. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel does not have a bar or a restaurant but it really doesn't affect you if you are off all day and night and using the hotel just to relax or sleep. It gives you an excuse to find some bars and restaurants around Amsterdam. After seeing alot of the other hotels I had been thinking of staying in I think the Caransa is the best one for a few reasons... it is modern, spotlessly clean, has great staff, is centrally located, in the best location I think for seeing everything in Amsterdam and it is in a safe area... I felt alot safer walking around here at night than other areas in the city. Also the tram stop is right outside the hotel which is very handy and very cheap... buy a strip card for 6.80 in a shop it works out cheaper than paying everytime you get on. I would definately recommend a trip to the following Artis Zoo, Anne Frank's House, the Ice Bar and the Aussie bar on Rembrant Square (happy hour every day at 5 - 6pm and 10 -11pm, cocktails are only 3 euro and they are gorgeous). We went to the Sea Palace Chinese Restaurant it is very impressive but to be honest the food isn't great and it is quite expensive for what you get... I wouldn't go back there again. Just be careful in the Red Light District of pick pocketers especially around the lanes... we were followed one day. Overall this hotel is brilliant and located in a perfect location... definately worth a stay and Amsterdam is definately worth visiting.", "Date": "October 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Good hotel\u201d", "Author": "sandra999", "ReviewID": "UR8658203", "Content": "Stayed here for 4 nights over bank holiday in August.

I went prepared though, with ear-plugs as it was a \"must\" that I sleep on the first night as we were there to take part in the marathon and half-marathon races! The room was immaculately clean and also had tea and coffee making facilities. The bathroom was a little on the small size but again very clean and well stocked. The shower was very good. The rooms seem to have been modernised as of late and are very tasteful and trendy. As I said before the reception area is of older and more dated decor. The staff were very friendly and efficient. I was sent off to run with complimentary sports drinks and quickly provided with a bag of ice for my weary muscles on my return! The buffet breakfast was fine, the usual cereals, breads, cheese, ham and fruit. There is a plentiful supply of great restaurants in the area away from the more touristy ones around the square.

Just a short taxi ride from Central Station (8euros) the hotel is situated amongst a row of large cafe bars with ample exterior seating - perfect for drinks and snacks whilst absorbing the laid back atmosphere of the square and ideally located for watching the inhabitants of Amsterdam -indeed the world-stroll or cycle by. The entrance of the hotel is scruffy and outdated in appearance and one could easily mistake it for having read its reviews that the hotel has recently completed its refurbishment. The hallway leading to reception is dated, dimly lit, is mirrored yet quite forbidding for a hotel that boasts it has 4 stars on its front door signage. The three of us had arrived four hours earlier than the requested 14.00hrs check in so we expected to leave our bags safely with the concierge. The check in was not as smooth as it could have been if the hotel had considered employing more than one person to handle telephone bookings, baggage handling, cash handling, settling bills, etc. for the work was clearly too much for one sole employee to handle. Nevertheless the friendly yet flustered multi-tasking receptionist informed us our room was being serviced and would be eventually ready for us circa 14.00hrs. We agreed to sample brunch at one of the external eateries nearby and we quickly fell into and alongside the laid back attitude of the Dutch whilst we absorbed the cafe society ambiance. So when our room had finally been serviced at 14.45hrs it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really seem to matter to us at all! Our bags had been left safely under the stairs with the concierge so we took the lift to the fourth floor where our welcoming (thankfully) refurbished modern twin superior en suite room slept three with a comfortable fold out bed for the third person in our party. The floor to ceiling windows let in a vast amount of light and the room faced out into the square and tram stops below. The buzz of passing trams, excited holidaying Europeans, shoppers, cyclists, dog walkers and partygoers could be shut out with the double glazed windows but we seemed to not mind the noise preferring it combined with the breeze that was offered with the windows open. The beds were extremely comfortable with spotless clean white linen and there was ample room for storage for three persons. The addition of the third bed did not encroach on the room space at all and was (I was regrettably advised) very comfortable to sleep on. The bathroom with shower was clean and modern if a little on the small side for no more than one person could frequent it any one time. We did not use the breakfast service so could not comment on this or the room service that only seemed to be advertising its menus in the lift. The hotel is ideal for its location and we were all content with the modern room and comfy beds if taken aback by the shabby dated hallways and reception areas. It is perfect for exploring Amsterdam and with so many beautiful walkways and canals, street side eateries, excellent shopping and a travel system that so, so easily puts the UK to shame one does not really wish to stay in a hotel room for any long period than necessary for fear of missing out on what beautiful Amsterdam has to offer.", "Date": "September 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best\u201d", "Author": "eliger", "ReviewID": "UR5564468", "Content": "We just come back from Holland, and stayed 7 weeks at the Caransa hotel.
