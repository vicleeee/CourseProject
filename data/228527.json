As others have pointed out, the hotel is in a great location for sight seeing, dining, shopping, etc. The only negative about our stay was that it was very warm and humid in Barcelona. We appreciated the complementary bottled water in our Premium Room, but our AC was not very effective. We were always a little warm in the room. Another reason to consider the Premium Terrace rooms is that you can open the balcony doors to let cool breezes into your room.

If you're going to do some shopping, which obviously is something you can't resist yourself from doing when you're in Barcelona, this is the hotel you should stay in, because it is surrounded by all the grand fashion names of women and men's fashion clothing. Next door to the hotel is Berscka, Zara, Mango, and opposite the hotel is Benetton, H&M, and many many others. We booked a standard room and when arriving at the hotel I noticed that the room window was a bit small and claustrophobic. I went down to the reception and thanks to Quentin, he arranged for us to change the room with a balcony facing the pedestrian street. And although outside was very noisy inside with the door shut, was a very quite place. The room was comfortable and well appointed -- not huge but adequate for two people. The decor of the room was really nice with a huge bathroom. When you walked out the front door of the hotel we were just steps from the Cathedral, Palau de Musica and El Corte Ingles \u2013 the big department store. The staff were really friendly and always tried to do their best to help in any way possible. They spoke English well \u2013 and were extremely helpful in giving directions and suggestions. We liked everyone we met especially Quentin and Sergi and the lovely lady with long hair, (sorry I can't remember her name) were particularly helpful to us when we asked for assistance.

The room was comfortable and well appointed -- not huge but adequate for two people. It faced the back of the building overlooking the lovely courtyard.

The staff was courteous and considerate. They spoke English well \u2013 and were extremely helpful in giving directions and suggestions. We liked everyone we met -- Miguel and Oscar were particularly helpful to us when we asked for assistance. Even the maids were friendly and the room was very clean \u2013 and made up quickly and efficiently when we left in the mornings. We loved that wi-fi was free\u2026and the connection was fast and reliable. (We have previously stayed in hotels that charged up to $20 per hour of internet connection.)

Our room had no view, overlooking a tiny courtyard, but was otherwise adequate; clean and big enough. We arrived early in the day, and they were happy to look after our bags until our room was ready. When we got back from our walk at 2 p.m. our bags were already in our room. The breakfast area was pretty, and breakfast itself was quite good. The staff were always attentive and friendly. However, looking around at the courtyard where breakfast was served showed a mixture of new, old, and attempts to cover up run down aspects of the hotel itself. Unfortunately, on our first night, there was a power cut from 8 p.m. until 2 a.m. As the streets of Barcelona are a little dangerous at night, we stayed in our room with candles provided by the staff.

I was pleasantly surprised -- the staff here are amazing. For example, I left my sunglasses at breakfast and got them back the next morning. We arrived without advance notice at 9am and they had a room ready and clean for us. There is always someone at the front desk. The hotel has an amazing location. If you're coming in from the airport, you get off the RENFE train at Passieg de Gracia and walk about 4 blocks to the hotel. The hotel is in a pedesterianized area in the old town (but close enough to the metro so that you feel safe at night), one block from Las Rambla, one block from the Placa Catalyuna metro stop, and about two city blocks from the cathedral. There's a supermarket in the basement of the Cortes Ingles department store (not the one next to the hotel, the bigger one one block away at Placa Catalyuna). We basically didn't need public transit (except to get to Monjuic and La Sagrada Familiga) and walked all over the old city and the waterfront. Very convenient. The room was clean, small, and adequate. We were in room 411, which is on the top floor, with a small window that faced a blank wall (no view, alas), but the room was dead silent, even though there was construction on the hotel pool and jackhammers going less than 20 feet away. As usual for Europe, there were two twin beds that were kind of hard (in a bad way) in a very small room. The bathroom was almost the size of the sleeping area, and was very clean (towels and toiletries replaced daily). The TV didn't work, but that didn't matter much to us. You have to insert your room key to make the AC and lights go on. Upon inquiry, the breakfast buffet (normally 15 euros) was included in our Orbitz deal. I'm not sure if I would have paid the 15 euros when there were cafes all around offering a pastry and a coffee for 2 euros, but since it was included, we partook every morning. Breakfast is 7-10:30am M-F and 7:30-11am on weekends. We turned breakfast into brunch and skipped lunch. The buffet is in a new building on the back patio. You have the choice of sitting in the sun, or indoors, or when it's nice (most days), indoors with the sliding doors open. This is a very very nice buffet, with a selection of waters, wine, juices, yoghurt, cereals, fresh fruit, dried fruit (dates, figs, apricots, etc), cold cuts (including serrano ham) and cheeses, pastries (chocolate crossants, plain crossants, muffins), breads and baguettes, a toaster, a sandwich press, eggs over easy, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, and two types of torta espanola (fritatta for Italians, and egg and potato casserole for Americans); and of course, tea + coffee. Most of the food was of really high quality (I didn't venture into the American breakfast section, but had thirds of everything else). The dinner option at the hotel is almost the same price as breakfast (18 euros pp for your choice of 3 courses, including a bottle of wine and mineral water -- when you see what prices are like, even in the tapas bars, you will understand how this is a deal). I would go back, but would request that they push the beds together to form one big bed -- we didn't bother with this, but I saw one of the maids doing it in another room.", "Date": "June 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cdisappointing and noisy\u201d", "Author": "twyly", "ReviewID": "UR10869611", "Content": "I booked 3 days to celebrate my partner's birthday and our 2nd anniversary...

Hotel was very easy to find (2 min wallk from the Plaza Catalunya (catch the A10 bus from the Airport - EUR3.75) Hotel room was spacious even with the 3 of us sharing. Air conditioning was useless and the rooms were very sticky at night. Location was perfect for walking around and catching the tour buses from the Plaza Catalunya. Great shops available just outside the hotel (good for last minute bargains). Only complaint was the staff - very rude and did not smile! Also, they forgot to mention that a marathan was happening which ran right in front of the hotel and caused traffic chaos (not good as we were checking out that day).", "Date": "March 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cNo complaints whatsoever\u201d", "Author": "stoofer", "ReviewID": "UR4499987", "Content": "Just back from staying here and cannot fault the hotel in anyway.

We asked for and got adouble bed, the downside was it was a very small double in the smallest hotel room we have ever stayed in with a tiny bathroom too! The thermostat in the room was not working and the engineer arrived to fix it on the morning we left( 5days). The tv only had spanish channels working because, according to the very offhand manager, we dont have rain in Barcelona so cannot make the system work when the weather is bad. Good points - 2 of the staff were very helpful ( the others were not interested), the hotel is clean but very basic, and is in perfect location.
