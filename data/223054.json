Reception staff friendly and helpful. Room - on the 1st floor. Fairly spacious and decent-sized bathroom but a little dingey and pokey. Good wifi connection. However this particular room was, as I discovered the next morning, underneath a mezzanine where people get to other rooms. The noise of a chambermaid's trolley (I assume that's what it was!) literally sounded like bombs were falling around the bedroom. Also - use every lock available to stop chambermaid's from enterting your room. I'd love to say that in this hotel \"Do not disturb\" signs are observed - but they're not. You'll get knocks on your door from 9am and they'll try and get in.

I had always had the impression that Super 8 was one class below Best Western. But I have to say that I was wrong. This hotel is perfect for a basic place. It has a nice and welcoming lobby with friendly staff. The room is clean and a good size. You will find a coffeemaker, fridge, microwave and TV with many channels. On each floor there is an ice machine and vending machines with drinks and snacks. Across the street there are some local/small supermarkets, but no big name grocery stores can be found in the immediate area. The price of the room is including internet and breakfast and parking which is a huge plus. The breakfast is very basic: Cereal, Milk, juice, apples bagels&creamcheese, coffee and tea. I enjoyed my stay at this place, mostly because of the room and nice atmosphere at the hotel. I have also stayed at the Dragon gate Best Western which is not too far from the Super 8 and has simular pricing. When I compare the 2 strictly on the room and hotel, I would say that both are equally nice. But the location of the Dragon Gate Best Western is better. Super 8 is on a bit of Sunset Blvd that doesn't have anything to offer. No restaurants, no shops and it is basically not close to anything. When you have a car, this is of course no problem. If you will not have a car. It is only a minor problem. Super 8 is about a 25 minute walk away from Union Station, or you can catch bus 2 or 4 (bus stop Sunset/Innes).

I booked this hotel \"On-line\" for my wife and myself Friday, Aug. 12, 2005 for one night. The hotel is nothing better than 1-1/2 stars. We reserved a non-smoking room through their official site, but received a room that had ash trays. Do ash trays equal non-smoking? The room had a odd smell, but we did not complain to front desk...as it was only one night. The neighborhood is not a place to take your kids, nor yourself. There are not any restaurants, grocery stores, within walking distance. We had pizza delivered to our room from Dominoes. During the night there were many loud noises and people yelling once in a while. NO PARKING...We ordered in because we didn't want to lose our parking spot. There are only about 20 parking spots for the 3 floors of motel rooms. People started parking in the two handicap spots as the side streets were full. The area just did not feel safe. We booked this hotel a few weeks in advance to go to the Dodgers and Mets game on Saturday Aug. 13, 2005 then planned to drive back to our residence in central California after the game...HOWEVER... THREE WEEKS LATER...I received my credit card bill and was charged $82.02 for Aug. 12, 2005...AND then another $82.02 for August 14, 2005. We had only booked for one night and only stayed for one night. ...I called the hotel to get reimbursed for the extra 82.02. The first time I called, I spoke with the night worker (Rafael, I think)...he looked up the paperwork and told me that I called to add a day to my stay. I explained to him that I reserved for one night and it was on-line only. He proceeded to tell me that I was wrong. I even have the receipt from the one night with ONLY Friday checked off (beyond the fact that I never called). Anyway, he told me to call back the next day to speak to the manager. I spoke to the manager (Adrianna) and I received the same exact response. She even said I spoke to her about extending the stay (I never made any calls to the hotel or Super 8). I got really frustrated at this point. She said she would have to talk to the owners about the situation. What is the point of a manager if they can't take care of simple errors like this one. ...I have also called the main Super 8 phone number and all they said they can do at this point is submit a complaint which goes to the same hotel (not much sense in that is there?...even when I explained the hotel has not cooperated). Super 8 billing said that I would have to wait at least 7 days before they could butt into the situation (that I may add was not my fault or error, but instead the hotels). I am going to call the hotel back today to see what the owners will say about the situation. I will update my review when the 82.02 is credited back to my account. ...If they cannot cooperate and solve a simple problem like this, I will submit my complaint to the District Attorney and copy it to the Better Business Bureau and get it solved myself. Who knows how many other people they have tried to DOUBLE CHARGE. Next time I will stay at La Quinta or Baymont Inn. I am done with Super 8 after I get my 82.02 back in my wallet.
