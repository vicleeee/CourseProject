Lobby decorated in the same slightly heavy and dark style, lobby bar has no atmosphere at all. Elevators are located up 2 steps so i am not sure how a wheelchair guest may reach their room. Excellent breakfast, up to the standards of UK or US style buffet. Staff are competent and have good English, they just don't like smiling or initiating assistance. Hotel is located within a 10 minute walk of 3 Metro Stations, access to the city is very easy, also a bus to the City Centre ( SOL) is only 3 minutes away.There is always a taxi waiting outside, Barrajas Airport is about 25 minutes away.

Still better value than getting a cab. I had done the research to get to the hotel - one change of metro line pink 8 to Columbia, and then Purple 9 four stops to Nunez de Balboa station. However there are two exits one of which is significantly closer to the hotel than the other! you need the one on Calle Velazquez. Hotel staff very good - our rooms were on the 4th floor - not as close together as we might have liked but it worked out fine. Being Brits I had brought a travel kettle and some UHT milk which was fine in the minibar! Word of warning - the mini bar is ultra expensive and so do not drink or eat anything ;-). Room was great, bed good, bathroom fine. We had a view over the local church - the girls looked out onto the main road and the American Embassy.

I had booked B&B and the buffet breakfast is seriously excellent! Loads of choice and as much as you can eat (we certainly ate lots and enjoyed it)., On our first evening we decided to try out the restaurant which in the basement of the hotel.

Remember that the locals eat late - restaurant empty till 9.45pm.

I was very lucky to get a great deal for the hotel - I paid roughly 59-65 Euros a night (room only) via the internet. Breakfast is 20 euros and it is the best breakfast I've have in Madrid. It is served in the breakfast room on Ground Floor. There are plentiful platters of fresh fruit (watermelon, rockmelon, strawberries, oranges, pineapple etc), a large variety of cold cut meats, eggs, and hot food (eggs, croquettes - yummy!, mushrooms). Each morning when I was there there was a fresh leg of ham which would always be cut when the small plate of ham ran out - the best fresh ham you could ever eat! There are different variety of breads / bread rolls and you can toast bread if you like. The hotel has a couple of restaurants / bars but I didn't try them. I did order room service and it was very prompt. The hotel directory that is in each room is very comprehensive with useful numbers for calling overseas, transport information and the menus from the restaurants and room service (it is in Spanish and English). My room was always spotless. The bathroom was adequate althought the bath was on the small side. As I am a tall person, it was definitely too short for me. The hotel provides safes free of charge which are located in the wardrobes - you will need to enter a 6 digit code. I used the business centre and the cost for about 30mins was a little over 7 euros. The internet connection was fast. Also, there is free printing inside the business centre. There is a luggage room where you can store your luggage. A taxi ride from the airport took about 25 mins - expect to pay around 20-25 euros to get there. The TV has spanish, french, english and one portuguese channels. Check in was very quick as I had arrived around 10.30pm so was glad to go straight to my room. Reception staff can give you a map of Madrid if you ask. It you want to go to Gran Via, you can walk and it is best to do that now. It will take you about 20-25 mins. There are some road works / construction going on along Calle Serrano. From what I could read, there is an underground fast-speed link being built so traffic is pretty heavy during the day. If you want to do day trips around Madrid eg Royal Palace, Segovia, Avila etc, reception staff can provide you with a list of excursions and the travel company can pick you up from the hotel. I did a 1/2 day tour to El Escorial and got picked up to join the other tourists. The only thing I would say is that the walls are paper thin and you can hear people talking and doing other activities!

The Paseo de la Catellana is nearby and provides a scenic walk if you feel strong enough to walk down to the Prado, about a twenty minutes to half hour walk. The lobby is quite comfortable and is always full of people lounging in the intimate furniture groupings, or sitting in the bar area that is adjacent. The staff is friendly and bilingual and will change dollars into Euros. There are three elevators that are quick and efficient and halls are clean and beautifully carpeted.

There were two English language television stations. Closets are large with plenty of space for hanging clothing, a safe, and some shelving for storage.

Situation for shopping and eating is very good. Service was correct, but a bit indifferent and unpersonal. I have been told that this is not unusual for Madrid. I did find it correct, that my car was parked into the close-by (public)parking by the clerk, who also helped to unload and load the luggadge.

This is one of their duff ones. It is perfectly clean but it is a souless place. As ever with certain Spanish Hotels, getting service is difficult. Check in was unwelcoming. Noone was available to carry bags to the room. Breakfast in the room was ok, but it was 30 minutes late. The hotel will not provide an Iron. I shall never stay here again. I was on business at the Felix, which was a nicer building, but once again coaching the staff to get drinks was a nightmare. A simple drinks order taking almost 30 minutes.

The restaurant's food was quite alright, absolutely nothing wrong with it, but there are a lot more cosier/more typical Spanish restaurants in the neighbourhood, so check'em out, you won't regret it!!! Breakfast was as it should be: a nice large buffet, hot and warm, great way to start your day! We'll especially remeber that - 'though we had already checked out by noon sunday - they let us have a room for an hour or two at five o'clock in the afternoon, so that we could refresh ourselves a little, before heading of to the airport - wich came in very handy after walking around in Madrid on a very hot day (!) That's what I call great service The hotel is situated practically across the American embassy in a classy area of Madrid (shoppers will love it as all the great and prestigious brands are on the great Serrano boulevard - one minute on foot from the hotel) You see, it's kinda hard to think of a flaw, we had a perfect minibreak in Madrid, and the hotel was definitely part of the succes!!", "Date": "July 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "villahermosa tabasco", "Title": "\u201cnot for demanding travellers\u201d", "Author": "demandingtraveller67", "ReviewID": "UR2874090", "Content": "Nice staff, very helpfull, great location, but the rooms are not nice and dont even dare to take a single room because they are really for one person.
