I knew even upon booking the hotel, in my dealings with Jeffrey, that this was the place to stay. The shuttle arrived quickly upon our arrival at the Miami airport, and the hotel was approximately a 5-10 minute drive away. The location is fabulous, with a Walgreens, restaurants and a shopping centre directly across the street! We were greeted immediately with a smile and checked into our room within minutes. The room was spacious and clean, and the free wi-fi was a bonus! The pool was refreshing and there is a very nice lounge area surrounding it. Very relaxing after a long flight. The breakfast was terrific and was a great start to our day. They even had flavoured creamers for the coffee:) We utilized the fitness centre, and it had something for every fitness buff! We decided to take a taxi to the Port of Miami, and Valerie booked us a larger taxi to accommodate the four of us and our luggage - It was just under $30 with tip. I cannot say enough about the friendly staff at this hotel. From the front desk to housekeeping, everyone was very friendly and went above and beyond to be accommodating. Following our cruise, we returned back to this hotel to stay another night. We arrived shortly after 10:00 a.m., but Valerie secured our luggage and we were checked into a room by 11:00 a.m. A young couple had stayed at this hotel pre-cruise as well, and returned here following the cruise to see if they could pass some time before their flight left that evening. Although they were not staying another evening, the hotel staff accommodated this couple and even secured their luggage. I had trouble printing my boarding passes for our flight the next day, and Valerie also printed these out for me on the hotel printer. She always had a smile and wanted to ensure our stay was enjoyable and relaxing. We certainly were well taken care of and had no worries! Thank you Hampton Inn & Suites - Miami Airport/Blue Lagoon! Your sincerity and hospitality did not go unnoticed! We will definitely book here again if we return to Miami, and will certainly recommend it to family and friends!

I just want a clean room, a good place to work out, fast internet connection to get my work done, and perhaps a decent TV on which to rent a movie if I've time. That's a pretty low bar to set. And yet, this property failed across the board: 1) Internet connection was close to dial-up speed. 2) Workout room was an absolute DISGRACE. The weights machines were ancient and in poor condition. No free-weights/dumbbells at all. One single treadmill. An embarrassment all 'round. 3) TV wasn't working properly. I called down to ask and they said the 'system ha[d] been down for a while'. (?!)

The room was clean and well appointed; the bath was large and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was typical for Hampton Inn and plenty for us - the seating area was large and included an area just outside near the pool. Tip: At the time of check-in, go ahead and arrange for the cruise ship transfer in the morning. This assures you can choose your preferred time (we left at 10 am for early boarding, elite members). On a Saturday morning, for a group in a bus towing a luggage van, this was one of the smoothest transfers, with speedy stops at each ship in turn. Excellent and efficient driver.

There are plenty of other hotels that are closer to the arena, and for the most part, all of those hotels are either run down, or cost a fortune. If you only care about distance, this hotel is not for you. However, if you are like my wife and I, and want to stay at a quality hotel for a decent price, or if you want to be close to the airport, then this hotel is for you. At the time I booked this room, this hotel was rated by Tripadvisor as the #9 hotel in Miami! It is rated that high for a reason, this was an excellent hotel. We arrived promptly at 3pm (check in time), and I was greeted by two wonderful girls that were working the front desk. Both were very friendly and professional. They were both very engaging, asking the reason for our trip. When I advised that we were going to a concert, they informed me of another concert, the \"Chili Cook-off\" that was in the area the next night. Being in Miami, which is a very cosmopolitan city with a large Hispanic population, both girls spoke both English and Spanish (I heard them on the phones with customers when I first came in the lobby). This is very helpful for any travelers which prefer to communicate in Spanish. My special room requests (High floor) were granted. The facility has both a 1st and 2nd floor parking area, each of which are accessed via room key, with a full security gate (I will get to the need for this shortly). The room was very clean. The only downside was no refrigerator, but the ice machine was close by. Comfortable bed, quiet, was able to get a good nights sleep. Bathroom was nothing special, just a typical hotel bathroom, however it too was very clean and there were enough towels. There was also a very nice, large flat screen television in the room. If you need it, a desk and chair, with free wi-fi. The hotel is not in the best area, although there is a McDonalds, Walgreens, and a Chevron gas station in walking distance. I would not hesitate to walk around the area myself, however I would not want my wife or children (if I had any) walking in the area alone. Most people that stay at this hotel probably do it as a convenient point for heading over to the cruise port or if you catch a late/early plane flight.

We drove non-stop (only stopping for potty breaks). We were advised to get a hotel out of Miami, to avoid high costs of hotels. When we arrived in Fort Lauderdale at 9am in the morning after a 22 hour drive, we checked the Trip Advisor app for a good hotel, we decided to stop at a Holiday Inn. I went in, and they said that including the standard cost of $130, we'd have to pay for an additional half a day since we wanted to check in before the standard check in. I wasn't down for that, so I went back out to my car, to see if we could get a better deal elsewhere. I looked up Miami hotels, and since I've had good experience with Hampton Inn, I decided to check out the reviews for the Miami Hampton Inn, Blue Lagoon. Called them right away and spoke with Kristen, I told her I was desperate for a place to rest my head, and that we had drove for so long. She told me to come on down, and that we could check in right away for the price of about $125. I mentioned to her I had read a review that said a customer had kept her car there (for FREE!) instead of driving it to the cruise port and paying $20 a day to do so. She put me on hold, came back and said I could also have the same thing, so immediately I knew we had to haul our butts to their hotel. Kristen was there to greet us, and had us checked in right away. Our room was 509, not too shabby of a room, our toilet clogged once (no biggie) and the hallway kind of smelled, but that was a MINOR MINOR problem, considering how much the Hampton Inn pulled through for us. Instead of driving our car to the hectic Miami cruise port and leaving it there for 7 days, which would have meant we would have spent $140 just to do that, we kept our car in the secured and gated bottom floor of the Hampton Inn garage for free. When we returned our car was safe and sound. We ended up paying about $145 for the room, and had free breakfast which is always a plus. The Hampton Inn at the Blue Lagoon, Kristen and the rest of the staff saved us big time.

The gym has a nice variety of equipment to use and since I stayed on the 11th floor, I also made use of the stairwell several times, so I was able to get a simple yet effective workout in without spending hours in a gym. Since I had to be at the airport early, I did not get to dine in for breakfast; however, I can always depend on Hampton Inn to have breakfast grab bags available. I've been a repeat guest of Hampton Inn for over five years and the staff and the hotel have always met or exceeded my expectations.

Most of the reviews we read were positive and that is the main reason we decided to book this hotel. When we arrived at the airport, we called the hotel and were given instructions as to where we needed to be to catch the shuttle. We found it very easily and waited for less than ten minutes for the shuttle. I found this free shuttle to be extremely valuable. We were a group of five and renting a car, but we could not all go to pick it up becaue of all our luggage. Check in was fast and easy. They let us check in early and even without a credit card since it belonged to someone in the group who had gone to pick up the car. We were upgraded to a complimentary suite which was greatly appreciated as we had three women with a lot of luggage and who all take long to get ready to go out. The extra space made it a lot easier! Our suite had two double beds, a good size bathroom, a kitchen with dishes, full size fridge and microwave; and a separate living room. When we first arrived in our room our toilet was not working, but they promptly had it fixed while we were out so it was not a problem. Our room was on the 4th floor and it was clean, which is very important to us. We did not hear any airplanes while we were in the room and the beds were comfortable. We had a message on our phone and couldn't retrieve it one day, and the girl we spoke to at the front desk did not know how to retrieve messages either and told us she would find out and get back to us. However, she never did. The hotel was packed the weekend we were there, but it was still nice and quiet. Breakfast was free and that is greatly appreciated. However, we felt like it could be improved. The eggs were inedible all the days we were there. The breakfast potatoes were always overcooked and often too hard to eat. But they had the waffle maker, oatmeal, cereal, fruit and some other things. I always found something to eat, and this saved me from having to spend money on breakfast. We always had coffee and tea available which was nice. We didn't use the pool, but we relaxed outside. We tried to use the hot tub one night and it wasn't working, I'm not sure if it was closed or out of service. We would have gone swimming but it was cool outside in the nights and the pool is not heated. The patio area was nice though. The area around the hotel is good. There is a TD bank, CVS, Walgreens, Publix grocery store and some other things all across the street and within easy walking distance. It was also really easy to jump on the expressway and get to anywhere we had to go. It took us about twenty minutes if that to get to South Beach, ten minutes to Dolphin Mall, ten minutes to Miami International Mall and 30 minutes or less to Sawgrass Mills. For us, location was important even though we had a car, and I would say that this hotel is in an excellent location. Check out was very easy. We were leaving on a cruise and they were able to find last minute seats on a shuttle to the port for us that works with the hotel for ten dollars. Overall, I would not hesitate to book this hotel and would stay here again.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tacoma", "Title": "\u201cpaper thin walls\u201d", "Author": "23Flipflops", "ReviewID": "UR121067151", "Content": "We had a room on the 9th floor.

We had free access to the internet to confirm reservations and get printed boaring passes. The room was spacious, spotlessly clean and had every facility one could expect. The pool was out of action but otherwise everything was fine. It has secure parking. There were plenty of OK local restaurants and fast food places. The hotel issued a warning about several restaurants that targetted travellers and offered poor food or had incorectly processed payments. There were plenty of gas stations to fill up the hire car before return. The area seemed OK. Breakfast was standard and OK with plenty of variety. Dining room staff were very cheerful and helpful. The journey to the airport was simple (two left turns and a 10-15 min drive). There is also a frequent shuttle to/from the airport.

We've stayed several times before as with the free shuttle bus & convenient location to the airport, it makes sense after a 9 hour flight from the UK, plus the awful immigration queues of over 2 hours.

I 'phoned to ensure that these works wouldn't disturb us in any way & I was informed that the works had been completed. Otherwise we would have cancelled our booking & stayed elsewhere. We had to wait a fair while for the shuttle. Upon arrival, I noticed that pieces of carpet were missing from the sweeping staircase. The receptionist said she had upgraded our room to one with a sofabed as well & it was on the 8th floor. On the 8th floor corridor, there were strips of wallpaper lifted up in what looked like a way of trying to dry them out & also the walls. Our room was clean & quiet. We purchased salads from the store across the street & then ate them out on the patio area overlooking the pool. The furniture was contemporary style & comfortable, in all a pleasant hour or so. The bed was awful!!! One of the reasons we stay at Hampton Inn's is because the beds are so comfy. I should imagine that this was similar to sleeping on a water bed. Everytime one of us turned over the other one moved in a ripple effect. We felt nauseaous by morning after a very disturbed night's sleep, or lack of it. There were workmen still working at the hotel so the person I'd phoned before our arrival was, let's say, economical witth the truth. We got up early, had a quick breakfast & then caught the shuttle back to the airport to collect our hire car. We drove back to the Hampton, settled up & checked out. Before leaving I asked the receptionist about the quality of our bed & she said that some mattresses had been changed.

The ac in the hallway was very loud it had a squealing sound to it. Luckily, we didn't hear it outside our door, but when we would go out you can hear it very clearly. There was complimentary internet. The internet connection was quite good. We did use the gym. The gym consist of treadmills, a stair climber, ellipticals, bikes, weight machines, a stretching apparatus ( you can do a variety of stretches on it), towels, a stability ball ( that could use air in it), there is a water cooler ( it was empty when we were there), There is a tv that you could watch a show if you wanted to. We did like that they had a large canister on the floor that had wipes it in that you could use to wipe off the machines or equipment that you use.

There seemed to have been a major leak from the top floors, as there was a bit of renovation going on in the main area stairs and hallways, with wallpaper coming away from the walls. Not a good 1st impression, but the rooms were good, which was the important part. Breakfast is on the 2nd floor and has an assortment of breads/pastries, yoghurts and a waffle making utensil.

The breakfast room was quite comfortable and had the view on a terrace with pool which looked very pleasant (but I didn't use it!). The value added of the hotel is that you have the feeling of being home, of finding people ready to help in whatever you need. The hotel has, for example, an agreement with a nearby car rental agency for special prices with the hotel customers.

I got the hotel's shuttle fairly quickly at the airport, and settled in quickly and efficiently to a comfortable room. There was excellent service at the front desk. The approximately $100 rate included breakfast, or, in the alternative, breakfast to go, if you have an early morning flight that requires you to leave for the airport before breakfast is served. The breakfast-to-go was certainly very basic - a couple of mini-cereal bars, a piece of fruit, and a bottle of water, all placed in paper bags at the front desk and ready as early as 5 in the morning, when I had to take the shuttle to the airport. It was not an ideal breakfast, for sure, but it was a nice touch. It certainly beats the \"sorry, you're leaving too early to get breakfast\" that you would be told at most hotels. But then again, the price, at around $100/night when I was there, is a bit on the high side for this 2-3 star hotel that is simply an airport hotel with very modest accommodations.. However, it nonetheless does favorably compare to other hotels near the airport, in terms of price and quality, at least judging by the looks of the hotels listed and available for online reservations in the area. The alternative I almost chose is the one hotel that is actually located right in the airport itself - the Miami International Airport Hotel.

The location and proximity to the airport was perfect- just a few exits away on the dolphin expressway. We were able to get to the airport rental car center within 10 minutes. Check in was fast and courteous. Rodney welcomed me to the property and explained the shuttle service (we didn't need it so cant comment), free breakfast, internet and parking and sent me on my way within minutes. The rooms were fine however we weren't really expecting much else than somewhere to stay near the airport. It featured a king bed, flat panel tv and a bathroom with a shower only (which was requested). I also received a great rate (under $100) by booking directly and only a week or so before. Our room was on the north side of the building on the top floor and had a wonderful full view of the airport field. As an aviation geek, that was an extra bonus! The free breakfast internet and parking were greatly appreciated, in an area where hotels will nickel and dime you for such amenities. To the person who complained of the steep parking entrance: why didn't you just park on the lower level?? Its covered, secure and I had no issues getting in. We didn't spend much time at the hotel itself other than to sleep and about an hour or so after checking in. We used the pool in that time and it was a bit dirty with lots of leaves and a few bugs floating about. Id suggest to management that it be cleaned more often. It was a milder day and the unheated pool was a bit uncomfortable so we moved to the hot tub, but the button that controlled the hot tub was not working. We didn't come here specifically to swim and were just killing time before dinner so this wasn't a huge deal. We went to south beach for dinner, which was just a short drive and straight shot down the dolphin expy, and returned later that evening to retire for our early am flight. The walls are a bit thin and you can hear conversations from the hallways. Doors slamming shut from other rooms also shook the walls. This made it noisy as people were checking into their rooms but it remained quiet through the night. The hotel information book had an interesting comment regarding local pizza businesses placing advertisements under hotel doors. They did not recommend guests using these businesses as there were complaints about product quality and bad service. Soon after I read about this, someone placed a menu under our door and I promptly opened the door and returned the menu to the woman and tried to tell her we didn't need it (but I don't think she understood English). My question is if the hotel doesn't want you using these restaurants, why do they let them in the hotel in the first place?

The staff said, \"oh no, very expensive... not recommended\", but she couldn't tell us the cost. She then went to ask another staff, he also said shuttle was cheaper, and trying to help us reserve the shuttle. We kept asking the approx. cost of cab, he finally told us it's about $30-35.

My biggest complaint would be the pick up process from the airport. The shuttle runs once every 30 minutes on the ticketing level and if you miss it, or it passes you by because it's full (as we did to several international passengers on Christmas evening), you're stuck waiting another 30 minutes. This was frustrating, as other hotels ran their shuttles continuously, allowing for timely pick ups. We waited 40 minutes the first time before being picked up and after waiting 30 minutes the second time, finally took a taxi to the hotel. The airport drop off service was fine, but the pick up service was really bad. There has to be a better way to do it, especially when one shuttle was always sitting idle at the hotel. This is almost a deal breaker for me when choosing an airport hotel next time. The last thing I want to do after sitting on a plane for two hours is wait outside for a hotel shuttle. A side recommendation: the Cuban restaurant in the shopping center across from the hotel is awesome.

When I made the reservation back in August, I emailed a gal by the name of Christina who put in the request for adjoining rooms both times as well as an early check in on November 21st. She said she would do her best. When we arrived at the hotel on the 13th we were given two separate rooms across the hall and down from each other. It made it somewhat difficult for my daughter to go back and forth from our room to her grandmas' room. We dealt with it and hoped that on our return we would get adjoining rooms, which we did not. We were assigned the very same rooms on a different floor as on the 13th. I was very frustrated and maybe the hotel does not know what adjoining rooms are. I assume that they are rooms that have an adjoining door in between them where we can go back and forth using the adjoining door, rather than the hallway. We also had a nightmare with the shuttle service that was to take us to the port but that is not the hotels fault , it was the gal who was calling out the cruise lines and skipped Royal Caribbean and left about 5 of us families behind because they did not want to unload all of the luggage and start over. She did arrange for another van to come and pick us up but most of the people got their money back and took a cab which we should have done. We had signed up for the noon pick up and finally left the hotel at 12:50PM. I sure hope this doesn't happen often but honestly I would take a cab next time since it's about the same price and you get there faster and easier, rather than going with 100 other people at one time. As far as the hotel it was a little bit dirty in the bathrooms. It doesn't appear that the floors had been vacuumed or moped as there was hairs all over the floors. I thought maybe it was just a fluke but it was like that on the 2nd night we stayed as well. It was a little gross so I was sure to wear my flip flops around the whole time. The breakfast was decent but it was very crowded due to all the cruise passengers.

There are multiple Hamptons in the area. At check-in we were upgraded to a suite. Very nice customer service. The suite had a king bed in a separate bedroom, nice bath, typical living area (couch, chair, tv) and a full kitchen (full size fridge, microwave, stove top, dishwasher) as well as plenty of cooking utensils, cookware and about anything else you'd need for an extended stay. The property is located across the street from a strip mall that has a Publix (grocery store), liquor store and several small restaurants. If you're looking for authentic Cuban food, we highly recommend Casa Juan. The waitstaff will help you interpret the menu, as will most of the many locals who dine there. The street you cross is six lanes - a bit like playing Frogger - but there is a crosswalk and a light at the corner. We booked early and secured our room for $89 with a AAA discount. By the week before the cruise, the same room was at $169. Breakfast was quite nice, hot and cold fare, but very crowded. Even the tables outside were full up with people looking for a place to sit. We offered to share our table and had a great time getting to know a couple from Portugal. We opted for a cab to the port ($30 with tip) instead of the shuttle. The shuttle was $10pp but didn't start running until 11:00am. The property decor is typical Floridian fare and is starting to show it's age.

My first stay was fine. I had a view of Miami International Airport, and it was very lovely to look at at night. On my 2nd visit, I noticed that my room just wasn't being cleaned. The bed was made, and it appeared to have been \"cleaned\", but I noticed my hair (which unfortunately falls often) wasn't just pushed around. One day, I returned to my room and noticed the trash had been bagged and left on top of my bathroom counter. Needless to say, that soured my impression of the hotel. The third time I stayed there (it was close to work), I went to my room and found that there were bags left behind by a previous guest. They had been shoved behind the armchair. I immediately went downstairs to request a new room and was given one. The new room was fine, except for the fact that when I reached for a towel after my shower, I noticed someone else's curly hair (it was black, mine is red/gold and straight) was in my towel. I was so highly turned off that I almost had to leave. Moving on to the front desk staff: The front desk staff was very helpful and accomodating when I reported my issues, BUT, I have to point out something that irked me. There was one gentleman named Rodney (there are actually 2 guys named Rodney that work there) who was wearing a jacket which had a huge rip in the elbow. As pleasant as he was, it was unprofessional and distracting, and I even pointed it out to him (although how he could have missed it was beyond me.) He shrugged it off saying, \"yeah, I know\" and smiled at me. On a scale of 1-5, the front desk would get a 3 from me and the housekeeping staff would get a 0. Oh and how could I forget...this part still puzzles me. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but the parking is gated and you have to swipe your room key in order to access the garage. You also have to swipe in the elevator if you want to get to the guest rooms (floors 3 and up.) I spent about 5 minutes in the elevator trying to figure out how to get upstairs the first time I went there, and after that, I spent a few different occasions explaining it to other guests. It's good because it means no strange characters can enter but at the same time, it's a little scary that they even had to put those types of barriers in place. I have already made my dissatisfaction known to the hotel management and made them aware of the issues, and they have implemented the 100% Satisfaction Guarantee and credited me for one night of my stay (which really didn't mean much, but I guess it's better than the alternative.)

The hotel is clean. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not in a bad location. For the most part the front desk staff was nice. But I just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the feeling of friendliness that I generally get when I stay at a Hilton property. Check in was stressful. I had made the decision to only use cash this trip and left all cards at home (this would be a major issue later). Evidently in Miami all hotels require a credit card at check in. Usually this is not an issue, however, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring one. So it became a bit of a tug of war with the check in clerk. I pointed out to the clerk, NO where on their website does it state they require a credit card for check in. Thankfully a friend had a card to put the charges on. But that led to another issue. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paying the full rate, but they were auth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ing the full rate on her card. My rate was much lower than the advertised rate. We pretty much had no choice. I paid cash for the room plus they auth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d $100 on her card. The clerk promised that the amount would be released upon inspection of the room. However, when we went to check out the room was never inspected. I stood there while the morning checkout clerk called the merchant services line and had the auth removed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the hotel, I did. I guess I just expected a bit more from all the reviews on tripadvisor.com and from my past experience with Hilton properties. The Room: I guess I am stupid and cannot read because we rode up and down the elevator trying to get the elevator to stop at the 6th floor but it would not. It was another guest who took pity on us and showed us the little sign that said to swipe the room card to access higher floors\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6of course that would have been something that I thought the front desk would have told us. But after laughing at ourselves we got to our room. It was a 2 queen bed and as I stated before very clean. Our view over looked the parking lot below and further the lagoon and the airport in the distance. I had called ahead and asked on a couple of times to make sure that my room would have a fridge and microwave. I was told it would. It did not. This is one of the very few \u00e2\u20ac\u201c actually I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of another Hilton property that does not have fridge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and microwaves in the room. But it was for only one night so not a big deal. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go down for breakfast the next morning but everyone said it was ok. Just you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re regular scrambled eggs, a meat and breads, juices and coffee. Check out was a lot better than the check in and I would stay here again, but next time I would be aware of the requirements for a credit card. The other thing that was a bit strange was the type of computers in the business centers. They had a lap top keypad, no mouse. I am not used to using a lap top and had some issues getting used to the computer, but that is just a personal preference. The hotel area Not bad at all. I had read it was in a bad area. There is a small shopping center right acros the street with a very good Cuban Resturant, a Publix and a couple of other stores. We ventured out beyond the hotel and I will say its in a much better then what I saw down town.

We arrived at midnight and received a nice, clean room with prompt, courteous service. I felt very safe here at all times. The typical Hampton breakfast was adequate, but there's a McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King,Subway and Starbucks within walking distance. There's also a Publix, Walgreen's and CVS nearby. The airport shuttle is convenient and free, although tips are always appreciated. From the airport, you can catch the city bus to the beach. I recommend getting the Metro card for $5.00/day, otherwise you pay for every transfer. Be sure to take the Express to the beach. You can also catch the South Beach shuttle. Be aware that the shuttles do not circle the island as they appear to on the map. You may have to get off and on more than once to get where you want to go. The current taxi rate to the Port of Miami from the hotel is $25. The hotel has a shuttle to the port for $10 a person. Be sure that you have the address of the hotel for your return visit. Our taxi driver did not know where it was, and we ended up going to the airport and catching the hotel shuttle back. Although we were close to the airport, we did not have any problems with noise and had a very restful night sleep. You may also have a view of the lagoon. Our taxi driver said that manatees are scheduled to be added to the lagoon next year. If this is true, I hope it won't affect the very reasonable hotel rates. The day we returned from the cruise we were very grateful to be able to check in early. (I requested this on our reservation.) We were able to catch up on our emails, Facebook, etc on the computers in the business area and with the WiFi in the room. We used the pool later in the day.

The first was a couple years ago with my hubby for a pre-cruise stay. While we had our share of problems that night with the elevators not working properly\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 people and kids running and shouting in the hall past midnight and a few other things, the manager contacted us and was very apologetic and asked us to try them again sometime. I remembered how wonderful it was to have the restaurants and stores within walking distance \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and the shuttle service would be great to use, since I was traveling with my friend this time and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to rent a car. So I thought this hotel would be fine for a one night stay\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6especially with all the great reviews it continues to get. Everything was going well. We called and caught the shuttle within a few minutes. After a short line, we were checked in to our room on a higher floor away from the elevators \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6just as I had requested. We took a little while to relax. The beds were comfortable enough. The TV worked fine. Then we decided we should go across the street and pick up a few things including some dinner. So it was then that I first used the bathroom. There was a powdery substance on top of the toilet lid. I cleaned it off with a tissue and glanced around the counter and floor. Then I noticed a lot of powder and some hair right in front of the tub. (see pic) Called the front desk and they said they would send someone up to move us. The gentleman arrived with new keys, checked out the powdery substance and apologized. We left to find our new room. It was right at the elevator bank. So I called the desk twice letting it ring numerous times. After no answer on the second attempt, we took our bags and went downstairs to request a new room. We were given another room. There were a few short hairs on the bathroom counter but we decided it was only for one night and we would make do. Though I could never get comfortable and feel like we were in a clean room. We checked out the pool\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but it was a cloudy green color and decided against it. The next morning we went to breakfast. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure they were trying to make it nicer than just donuts and coffee\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but the egg-like omelets looked odd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 somewhat like plastic and had an orange cheese-type substance in them. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much taste to them. The sausages looked like they were made of something other than meat. The muffins and donuts were as if they had been frozen and defrosted and were wet. The coffee was ok. I liked that they had French vanilla creamer. The staff that morning was very cheery and came by saying good morning to everyone as they passed\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. and even asked to take my partially eaten plate of food for me. Thanks.

Our room was comfortable but lacked a fridge, although I know there are fridges in the suites. However, I believe that in such a hot place, all hotel rooms need a fridge. The swimming pool was small and the water was very cold and but pool towels were provided and there were plenty of loungers. The breakfast buffet was a the biggest let down for us. We have previously stayed just round the corner in the Homewood Suites and their breakfast is also complimentary. However, the Homewood suites has enough seating, china crockery and \"real\" cutlery. We did not enjoy eating from plastic plates with plastic knives and forks. The number of tables provided was totally inadequate for the amount of guests. Finally, my 60 year old hubby was asked for ID when we went into the hotel shop for a can of Bud. Very flattering indeed!!!!

The second if the reservations system does not always match up the room with the profile. For example, my profile states no rooms next to the elevator.

The help youself breakfast buffet was delicious and varied every morning. We went for breakfast at various times between 7 & 10 and there was always plenty of choice and more than enough food. The Hampton Inn is opposite a Publix and other supermarkets/chemists and there is also a MacDonalds. We ate at the nearby 94th Aero Squadron restaurant at the end of the road a couple of times and would recommned that as a great place to eat. We made use of the swimming pool and the business centre computers. There was no problem with the parking at the Hampton Inn as this was in a secure car park under the hotel.

Check in was quick and easy, the guy was very helpful, and get this, they had a promo on, some \"gas promo\" so when we checked in they gave me $10 cash, not much, but its the first time a hotel has put cash in my hand at check-in!! Our room was high up on the 11th floor, as id requested,and overlooked the airport, as i requested. The room was a good size, a little dated perhaps, but very clean and comfortable, we had a nice view over blue lagoon and onto MIA. They hotel as no food options so we wondered across the street for a McDonalds (after 11hours travelling, just needed a quick snack, not a full meal) there are a few food options around that you can walk to, or the hotel bus driver is happy to take you somwhere locally, nice touch!! It was dark when we went out and the area felt safe enough, I would not hesitate in walking around alone. After a good nights sleep we headed down for the comp breakfast, there wasnt a huge choice but plenty to suit most and its was free so happy with that. Before we checked out we used the business centre to print some things and check emails, a nice feature, again it costs nothing, it can be found next to reception. We got the hotel to book us a space on there shuttle to the port - its not a hotel bus hence why they dont advertise it on the website, but for $10 each its good value, they have 3 a day 11,12,13:00, best to book when you check in, the trip only take 20min to the port. We booked thru the hotel website, as a hhonours member we got triple points, we paid $139, which compared to other hotels in the area was very good!!

I had just recently signed up for Hilton Hotels Rewards and decided to try one the hotels suggested through the Hilton rewards program. We choose Hampton Inn & Suites, Miami Airport as the price was right which included a continental breakfast and had shuttles to the airport and ports. Plus, I checked out some of the reviews on Trip Advisor and was satisfied that this was a place we could try. We were totally pleased with the service! First of all, the shuttle picked us up within 15-20 mintues of calling them from the airport. Our check-in was smooth and quick, our room was clean, the beds were super comfortable. They had a business office that we could use to check emails, surf the net, etc., at no extra cost. The staff super friendly and helpful, and best of all, they had great security, we felt very safe. The most AMAZING thing was the Honesty of their staff, totally outstanding!!!! ..--- This is what happened......my 13 year old son had been saving his money all year and after exchanging some of his canadian money he was exicted to have american money. Anyways to make a long story short, the next day we checked out at around noon, we had the hotel book a shuttle to take us to the port. We arrived at the port, registered and got on our ship. It wasn't until a few hours later that my son realized he had left his envelope with $120.00 (U.S) at our hotel room at the Hampton Inn & Suites. At this point my son is in tears, this was almost of all his money with the exception of what he had in his pocket. I immediately called the hotel to see if anyone found the envelope. I was told that the chamber maid who cleaned our room had already turned in the envelope and that the hotel had emailed us and called our home number and left a message of their findings! I told them that we were already on the cruise ship and that the ship was about to dock and that it was impossible for us to retrieve the envelope until the following week. The manager (Victoria, I believe) said no problem, that she would lock up the envelope till we get back there. Well, when we returned on Jan. 10, Victoria was on duty and immediately returned the envelope, needless to say, my son was grateful. I was grateful, and gave Victoria $20.00 to give to the chambermaid who turned in the envelope as her reward. It is so great to see such honesty and to know that there are honest people out there.

I'm a member of an extremely popular cruise review board where people join to do just about nothing but research. When I booked our cruise, I also made a pre-cruise hotel reservation at another hotel and I held that reservation for the better part of a year. The hotel, which we previously stayed at, didn't offer a complimentary breakfast or a shuttle from the airport or to the port. The advantage, it's in the Bayside Marketplace area, making it convenient to shopping and dining without the need for a taxi. This time, I couldn't get past the lack of other ammenities and began a search for another hotel. When I found the Hampton Blue Lagoon, I was so thrilled. Reviews on the cruise boards were positive. One negative to us would be it's close to the airport and not to the port, but the Hampton still offered convenient shopping and dining without taxi, and the bonus of a complimentary breakfast and shuttle from the airport . They also offered a independent shuttle to the port for $10 a person, and for two, that was still a bargain. I made a new reservation! Booking on the site was easy. Getting the complimentary airport shuttle once in Miami, was a negative. I personally blame Miami Airport for that. The hotel told us what # to call, but the usual direct hotel phone bank was not in site. Even the airport employees were not able to help....??? I carry my confirmation, so I called the hotel directly. We waited no more than 15 minutes and the shuttle was there. Their very friendly shutter driver took care of us! (He worked on Sunday am too, so I'm sure you'd run into him.) Just across the street has a publix, liquor store and restaurants and Walgreens was just a block away. Absolutely everything was within walking distance, and a taxi only needed if you can't walk. The shuttle driver said they'd drive us no charge to the (94th Aero Squadron Restaurant good food and view of plane takeoff and landing)...10 min + safe walk with sidewalk even available.... The airport noise was not an issue at all! King room was as expected, good. You need a room key to get past the 2nd floor, excellent safety!! Pool was nice looking but we didn't use. Complimentary breakfast very good, with alot of choices. Check in-out was a breeze, and the shuttle [independent company] picked us up on time and for $10 a person was all we needed.

The shuttle driver asked us several times if we had the correct hotel shuttle and we confirmed before he would load us up. He wasn't very chatty, but it turns out that's because he doesn't speak much English, but he was nice enough to confirm that there was a Publix shopping center right across the street from the hotel. When we arrived, check in was a breeze and the young lady at the front desk was very friendly and efficient. She told us about the breakfast and signed us up for the $10 shuttle to the cruise port.

If you're cruising and want to buy plastic bottles of soda/beer/water, do go to the Publix as the nearby Walgreens and CVS do not carry plastic bottles of these items (they have cans, large bottles or sell them individually). We had breakfast at the hotel in their free breakfast bar area and it was very nice considering it was free. The coffee was good and you could take it with you in to go cups, they had sausage, egg patties (yes, you read that right) and biscuits, in addition to bagels, toast, danishes, juices, milks, cereals, etc. The manager of that area was very good at keeping things re-stocked and had a good morning for you when you walked in and a thank you for you when you left. Check out was easy and the shuttle bus driver to the cruise port was on-time and ready to help with bags. All in all, I would definately recommend this hotel, particularly for a pre- or post-cruise stay. You're very near the airport, you have a free shuttle there and back and access to food/beverage/tolietries and the like for any last minutes items you may need (like flip flops or sunscreen).", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cGeat place for a pre-cruise hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "Coach_Lange", "ReviewID": "UR19964148", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in late August.

Third, their breakfast spread was very good for this range of hotel. The review that I just saw of this hotel is obviously from someone not accustomed to anything other than a full-service hotel, but as someone who stays in many Hampton Inns, Fairfield Inns, etc., it was very good. I liked that they had a juice machine and apples and bananas available 24 hours a day (and occasionally there were cookies). The front desk staff was incredibly helpful and friendly -- among the best I have encountered. The area around the hotel is nothing special, but it's safe and close to the airport and Coral Gables, plus close to major highways. The choices for dining around the hotel are limited -- we ate at the Cuban restaurant in the shopping center across the street, and while the food was decent, the service was DREADFUL, and we noticed that we received MUCH, MUCH worse service than the Spanish-speaking family that entered after us.

I'm very grateful to TripAdvisor for helping me find this hotel! PROS * Very near the airport * Shuttle runs frequently (and until midnight, without having to call) and promptly * Hotel is new and clean and well-maintained * I put a special request in my reservation...and the front desk staff actually noted it and assigned my room accordingly (surprisingly rare) * Very secure building at night -- key card needed to take elevator to guest room floors after hours * Free parking * Substantial breakfast (free) * Friendly front desk staff, housekeeping staff, and airport shuttle drivers -- I definitely got the sense they were glad I was there * Free internet access * Free fitness room * It's the little things...like the \"to go\" bags of breakfast food at the front desk; the newspaper being delivered to your door in a bag so you can take it with you without staining your hands or worse; the lounge area where breakfast is served is always available (and has free wifi) for you to work, socialize, etc. CONS Well, while I was at the hotel, I was formulating my TripAdvisor review in my mind. I was going to complain about the paper cups in the room. I mean, I usually stay in more upscale hotels and they always have glasses. But...i just saw a news expose at [--](entitled \"Dirty Hotel Secrets\") about how those glasses are never adequately cleaned in between guests, even at the best hotels. So now I am grateful to The Hampton Inn for sticking with disposables glasses! Sorry, I know it's wasteful, but I'm exposed to enough germs and viruses when I travel, I certainly don't need bugs on my hotel room glasses! Keep in mind the rooms are simple. This is a Hampton Inn after all. SUMMARY I stayed at The Hampton Inn & Suites -- Miami -- Airport South -- Blue Lagoon to break up my long international flights. I was very pleased with the place. It is as good as the TripAdvisor reviews say. As a woman traveling alone, I was grateful for all of their security measures.

I am an HHonors member as well, so I tend to frequent Hilton chain hotels... Negatives first: This is not much of a negative, actually, since this is an airport hotel. For anyone who does not know this area, it may be daunting, but this Hampton is in the heart of a very Latino area with some very good food places just a short drive away! Positives: This is the nicest Hampton I have stayed in! There is an attention to detail in the rooms that I have not seen at any other. It's amazing! I had a one bedroom suite that was absolutely spacious and is actually set up for long term stays with a 2 burner stove top, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, full sized fridge and all the utensils necessary ( including dish washing liquid and paper towels...again, details) The room was spotless and clean! The staff, from the front desk to the buffet hostesses to housekeeping must have taken a Disney course in etiquette because they are excellent! The pool(dawn to dusk) area is on the second floor as is the fitness room(6am to midnight) and the breakfast area ( with a large plasma TV for the AM news... again, details). One glitch during our stay was the Hot Tub was not working, but no worries there, since the pool area was just fine. Parking is on the first and second floor and requires a room key for entry into the gated garage. The first floor is covered, the second is not. We didn't use it, but there was an airport shuttle schedule posted at the front desk area. There is a convenience store (next to the front desk) with various snack foods and microwaveable items and of course, ice cream for the midnight munchies. On the first floor is also the business center with 3 computers. Of course as with other Hamptons is the complimentary Wireless Internet. Across the street is a Publix for grocery shopping and a 24 hour CVS drug store. For the fast food junkies, Wendy's, McDonald's and Pollo Tropical is a block or two away. 94th Aero Squadron is a good restaurant if you are looking for Prime Rib, but with its central proximity, this hotel is close to the fine dining of Coral Gables(15-20min drive south on 57 avenue - depending on the time of day). For an open air Latin experience, and I do mean open air kind of roughing it, the Palacios de Jugos is south on 57 ave and West Flagler. The specialty is chicharonnes( fried pork) and tamals as well as fresh fruits and juices. Beware, this is no way fancy, but you get a bit of the Miami, Latin flavor the way the locals experience unlike the South Beach experience which is definitely not the Real Miami. OK, to finish up the hotel review.. There is also Lodge Net for in-room movies and also free HBO with 27 inch TV's ( 2 in the suite)... And of course, here we go again, as in my other reviews, \"The Bed\".. very comfortable... Yep it's a Hampton and then some! FYI, I have stayed at the airport Hilton( Super Bowl Headquarters for the Chicago Bears) about a half mile away. This place is way better in my eyes for the quick overnight(regular room) or long-term stay( suite), from an overall value and cleanliness standpoint. If you are looking for full service (room service and restaurants), then this isn't it, but it is understandable how this Hampton beats all the other full-service hotels on Trip Advisor.

The rooms are well appointed and quiet, and the staff are informal, helpful and friendly. We stayed twice - on arrival we had a standard room and on leaving the USA we got a walk-in booking on the day - A suite for only $30 more!. The breakfast was good if you like fruit, cereals, juices, pastries and coffee and there were a few basic hot choices too. Sadly you have to use polystyrene cups and plates and 'snappery' instead of real cutlery. I noticed they have 'to-go' bags if you're in a hurry or have to leave outside normal breakfast hours. Free coffee was available all day and even some fruit and snacks in the afternoon. There's a small pool and jacuzzi. We didn't try these as it was dark on our first stay and very windy on the second. But they looked inviting and had the usual facilities. Car parking was free and convenient if you can negotiate a steep ramp. There's a plaza with supermarket, restaurants and other shops right next to the hotel and you should be able to find pretty much everything you may need there unless you want fine dining. The Cuban restaurant was OK for us. Driving in from the west on route 41 the hotel was nice and easy to locate, which is good if you are nervous about driving in Miami. We had some trouble getting to the hotel from the airport as we arrived at half past midnight. There's a shuttle that operates until 1am, but when we phoned at about 00:45 the last one had gone. Instead, reception told us to get a yellow or blue cab and the hotel would pay up to $14 of the fare (given a receipt). What they didn't say was that yellow and blue cabs have different charging structures and that yellows won't look at you for such a short journey (its less that a mile). Blue cabs were thin on the ground, but when the guy directing traffic outside arrivals saw me causing chaos by flitting from cab to cab he got on his radio and a blue cab arrived precisely where he said it would about 3 mins later. Blue cabs have zones and The Hampton is in zone 1 - $14 fare. If you arrive when the shuttle is operating be aware that you have to go to the departures area to board it. I noticed many reports here telling of difficulty attracting the driver's attention at arrivals. In fact, the airport authorities don't allow the shuttle to stop at arrivals - only departures. Advice on this is hidden away on the Hampton's website along with pictures to help you identify the right shuttle bus.

Our primary objective was to get a restful night's sleep and we achieved that in our room, which was large, comfortable (especially the bed) and very quiet (being near an airport and in a room with adjoining door on a low floor usually doesn't portend well, but we didn't hear any traffic, airplane or neighbor noise at all). Self-parking was available -- ample, free and safe. No view, no robes, no luxury, but we didn't expect any of that.

We were taken to the hotel and after checkin our prearranged transportation took us over to Bayside & some of the group to South Beach. When we wanted to stay longer we called the driver and he said NO PROBLEM. They picked us up where and when they said they would.

I emailed Hampton Inn from the ship and the Group Coordinator arranged for pickup--keep in mind that we were not staying at the hotel on our return--We were going home. She could not reach me by phone to confirm we worked via email. I called the driver when we reached Miami at 6am and he said Lourdes was unsure of the time but he'd be waiting with a group sign at the pier around 7am.
