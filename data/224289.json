Although we were checked in immediately upon arrival we noticed many other guests having to wait because their rooms were not yet clean. This was at 4:00 in the afternoon. You would think that by that time housekeeping would be long done. Our room was TINY. You could barely walk through it. There was simply no room. Everything in the room (two double beds which they claimed were \"queen\", a table, and another small vanity which the coffee pot sat on) were all crammed into the room. The bathroom was laso very small. There was barely room to close the door. To top it off - this room was out of date. Old CRT-TV. When we saw the size of the room we went back to the front desk, told the clerk we had ordered 2 QUEEN beds and had FIVE people in the room. We thought there would be room for my daughter to have her sleeping bag on the floor. Well, the clerk promptly told us these WERE Queen size beds (by whose standards I'll never know). He said the only thing he could have done was upgrade us to a suite but the one they had was occupied. The pool was small (no surprise) and the building seemed to be situated around it. It was in a corner. Amazingly, the hotel has a spa tub that is so deep that an adult can not sit down in it with out the water touching their chin. This was the only surprise. On the good side, the room was clean (although Housekeeping could have refilled the tolit paper which ran out in the middle of the night), the lobby area was nicely decorated, and the hot breakfast was plentiful with good coffee and very helpful breakfast staff. They charged $92 with tax. This place is not worth that rate. If you're only staying for a night and not expecting quality then this is o.k., but if (like us) you're frequent Hilton Honors Hotel guests this is not hte place for you. This place does not live up to hampton Inn standards.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clearwater FL", "Title": "\u201cHorrible room, bad service, corporate unhelpful\u201d", "Author": "worthyking", "ReviewID": "UR129877664", "Content": "They screwed up our reservation and put us in a double instead of king room, then switched us to a disgusting old king room in the elevator lobby...literally in the tiled lobby area where the elevators are. If we opened our room door we were staring at the elevator doors. The hum and constant ding ding all night made for a bad night's sleep. The room looked like it was decorated in the early eighties and had stains on the walls. I called the front desk (Shane) to inform him of our displeasure and he was rude and very unhelpful. When I pointed out the satisfaction guarantee printed on the room key his response was, quote: \"if you stay, you pay\". Meaning we would have to leave and go somewhere else in order to take advantage of their \"satisfaction guarantee\". After arguing with him for a few minutes he finally promised to talk to the General manager and get back to me with a solution. He never did. And studiously ignored us whenever we walked by the front desk. After the weekend I called Hilton corporate to file a complaint and invoke the Hampton Satisfaction Guarantee, which (quoted from their website) says: \"Our friendly service and free amenities are all backed by our 100% Hampton Guarantee\u2122. If you're not 100% satisfied, we don't expect you to pay. That's our promise and your guarantee. That's 100% Hampton.\u2122\". Well, that was a joke. They took my complaint and promised that the GM from the property would contact me within three days to resolve it. He never did. A week later I called corporate again and they apologized for all the trouble and offered me 2500 Hilton Honors points to make up for my trouble. Really?? I said no. I told them I wished to invoke the satisfaction guarantee. She said they don't guarantee room types. What a joke. After arguing with her for 20 minutes and another 10 on hold she finally said they would refund one night but not both. Unbelievable!! So, if you decide to try this hotel, here's my advice: 1. Book in advance and DEMAND a newly renovated room ONLY. 2. Don't deal with Shane at the front desk if you have any problems. 3. Don't leave messages or expect a call back on any issues you have. Be prepared to traipse down to the front desk and demand what you need. 4. Don't expect them or Hilton corporate to honor their written guarantee. Your \"satisfaction\" is not what their guarantee is about. It is simply a marketing ploy which they seem to honor grudgingly, only partially, and only after a lengthy argument. All in all a very unpleasant experience with Hampton and Hilton in general. We race at Daytona 3-4 times a year (as well as another 10+ weekends a year in other cities), travel with our team and crew and generally book 4-10 rooms at any property we stay, and as of this bit of unpleasantness we shall carefully avoid all Hilton owned properties in the future. I hope it was worth it to Hilton for that $88 of mine they got to keep.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coconut Creek, Fl.", "Title": "\u201cLocation was great\u201d", "Author": "opichardo", "ReviewID": "UR126946683", "Content": "Great location for bike week.

I originally booked a different speedway hotel, but switched to the Hampton Inn based on the comments concerning the staff that I read here \u2013 I was not disappointed.

The hotel is on a main road \u2013 with many restaurants and stores close by. There was a mall across the road \u2013 we didn\u2019t go there, but it seemed to have a good number of stores. We spent one day at the Speedway, and drove to the beach the other days. It was not a bad drive. The hotel gave us directions, and pointed out places to park near public rest rooms, food, etc. available. There were times I was sorry that we didn\u2019t stay at a hotel on the beach and commute to the Speedway \u2013 but in truth, it wasn\u2019t a bad drive to the beach, and the thrill my nephew got when he could see and drive by the Speedway everyday was well worth it.

And it's 1 block from Daytona Speedway. My husband and I just returned from a trip to Daytona for the Daytona 500. The hotel was completely sold out and very busy. Yet, every employee we encountered was not only nice and accommodating, they were exceptionally so. At first I thought that maybe Daytona was populated with nice, happy people until a friend who was staying at a Wyndham at Daytona Beach said her experience was the opposite; she encountered rudeness and indifference. I've come to the conclusion that being kind and gracious is a requirement for employment at the Hampton. The hotel provides a shuttle to/from not only the airport but to anywhere in a 2 mile radius. This came in very handy for us to do shopping and to pick up race credentials. Also they provided transportation to the racetrack which was a real perk. The room was spotless and very tastefully decorated. The bathroom was small but the layout was nice and it functioned very well. Both the room and the bathroom have design touches that I may even incorporate in my own home. Though we didn't use it, the work station in the room was efficiently laid out. Breakfast was provided and was good. It included fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, assorted sweet rolls, muffins and bread. Additionally, there were two hot items that changed daily. We had a wonderful \"happy hour\" with drinks and snacks (hot and cold) that revolved around race times.
