Hotel is actually looking at the building of a train and metro station and also on the left you can see the skycrapers and straight ahead an old construction ground.

The entrance is placed oddly at what should have been the back of the building, opposite the Charmatin train and metro station. If you come by taxi, ask to be dropped off at the train station, on the ground level at the entrance to the metro. Once you enter the place, you realise that this hotel is destined for four stars. The lobby, although a bit quirky at the entrance as noted before, is functional with friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are excellent. Very roomy with a huge double bed, and all the facilities you would usually expect in any three star plus some extras. We were given a bath robe and slippers, and there were ironing facilities, as well as a hair dryer in the bathroom. The room was clean, no musty/cigarette smells, and had new modern decor. The only real complaint we had was we could not get the aircon/heating system to work properly. When we arrived housekeeping had set it quite warm, meaning the room was very hot. We solved this by just switching it off, and opening the windows for a few minutes. The rest of our stay we left the aircon system off, and that worked out fine. I would suggest though that if this occours to anyone else, then it obviously a hotel problem and one should then inform reception to get it fixed. The only times we used the restaurant was for breakfast, where we decided to go for the breakfast at 9 Euros a person. Granted this is a little on the steep side, but the buffet is excellent with a wide variety, and more importantly stays open until 11am - a godsent after those Madrid bars. As far as parking is concerned, the hotel does provide this but at an expensive rate of 25 Euros a day. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon, and found a spot on the street outside. Parking in these spaces is free on the weekend, and it was easy to find a spot then. We stayed through to Monday afternoon, and thus Sunday moved the car underneath a large roadway bridge just outside the station, opposite the hotel. This is parking in dirt, but the spots are not marked and neither are those spaces illegal, so if you arrive at a quiet time of day and have a bit of patience, you can find good street-side parking. The car appeared to be safe there, obviously you wouldn't park your Porsche 911 there nor anywhere else un-protected in any large city. The trip by Metro into Madrid from Charmatin is quite fast - although it appears far off it will actually take you no more than 10 minutes to reach Sol metro station. Charmatin metro station itself is an architectural marvel and almost worth a visit in itself. Overall we enjoyed our stay at this hotel thoroughly, and were pleasantly surprised by its high standards. If you can get a good rate, I would highly recommend staying here.", "Date": "February 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gainesville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly Surprised\u201d", "Author": "bocalbabe", "ReviewID": "UR5516206", "Content": "My boyfriend and I booked a room at this hotel while we were staying in Burgos, Spain. We weren't sure how things were going to turn out since we didn't know much about the hotel. Nonetheless, we were pleasantly surprised! From the airport, our taxi cost us around 20 dollars. The biggest problem was finding the place. We had the street address, but the driver couldn't find it. It's not located off of an actual road. He dropped us off at the Apartamentos Centro Norte and we took it into our own hands to search the area for it. After 10 minutes of looking around, we found it to be in an area of construction and parking, off of a street (basically to the back). If you are trying to get there by taxi (we learned soon after) it is located right next to the Charmartin Metro Station! I highly recommend talking to the hotel personnel about giving directions to taxi drivers. My boyfriend was staying over in Madrid another couple of weeks, so he switched hotels to Hotel Nuevo Madrid (due to a better price for the long run) and our taxi driver could NOT find it with the directions we got off of the website. So, it is a good idea to get driving directions for the drivers. The hotel personnel were friendly and spoke good English. We had no problem getting into our room, even when others warned of issues with booking online. Just bring all of your paperwork (confirmation numbers, etc) to be safe. The room was very comfortable and large (we just got a standard room with twin beds). The only problem with the twin beds is they roll apart. lol But, I think their twin bed size is bigger than American sized twins, so two people sleeping together in it is not uncomfortable at all. There are a few channels in English (MTV, CNN, and something else, which I cannot remember). The bathroom is very nice! Big bathtub with a great shower head. Also there's a bidet for all of you bidet lovers out there. ;-) Oh, when you walk into the room and the lights don't come on when you hit the switch, place the card in the slot next to the door on the wall. It's really a smart way to save on power...I don't know why more American hotels do that. This hotel also has a huge pool. It gets crowded though, especially in the summer months. The hotel offers a buffet breakfast for 12 euros per person. It was not included in our room. BUT, when we arrived two hours early to check in (and couldn't) the hotel clerk told us where the breakfast was. We went in (expecting to pay) and after we were through and asked for the bill, our waiter looked confused and said no problema, all is ok. So, we got our first breakfast for free. Hmmmm, this is terrible to say, but you could possibly take advantage of this situation and get it free since we just saw everyone get up and leave after eating...We didn't do this though and ended up getting breakfast in the city at cafes. All in all, it was a nice sized buffet with lots of good food (even for you picky eaters out there). I would recommend it if you weren't on a budget. We couldn't have asked for a better location to the metro. As you walk down the steps and to your right, the Chamartin station is the building in front of you. There are a lot of cars and construction around it. It's not really marked that well either. But, keep trucking and you will see the signs for the metro. There are a lot of steps at this station though, so if you are not able to climb up at the end of the day, then I would recommend staying somewhere else. I think since it is still under construction they don't have all the escalators working. Nonetheless, the 10 line is there and it takes you into the city. It is a new line with air conditioning. Very nice. For a little over 6 euros you can purchase a 10 ride pass. The metros are very easy to use and find. I highly recommend using this form of transportation. Taxis can get expensive.", "Date": "July 27, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "TRYP Madrid Chamartin Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d228518-Reviews-TRYP_Madrid_Chamartin_Hotel-Madrid.html", "Price": "$60 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Mauricio Ravel 10</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28046</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> (Formerly Tryp Centro Norte)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "228518", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/a5/65/a565bc854a06967cb6c35a20b191bf1b6large.jpg"}}
