We booked 2 rooms, one room was supposed to have been a suite which was not. We were told that this hotel did not offer suites even though we were told that's what we were getting when we booked the rooms. Our vehicle had the back glass knocked out of it, the 2 back seats were stolen along with other expensive items we had in the back of our vehicle. I promptly reported this to the front desk and asked about the security cameras. The front desk attendant assured me that the camera tapes could be pulled but loe and behold, they have no security cameras as stated by the manager. I then was told that they have a night watchman the performs roving patrols of the grounds. Our vehicle could have been plainly seen from the front desk. The manager asked me if I would like for them to call the police, I said yes if thats not too much to ask for. The Dallas police were prompt and performed their job as they should have. No mention was ever made from this hotel management at the onset of our dilemma to ease our burden. After 2 hours into this ordeal, my wife ordered pizza for our children, due to getting late in the day. We had asked if the hotel shuttle service could take my wife and children to a restaurant which was about 3 blocks away, however we were told it would be an hour or so before they could take us. The pizza delivery person told her that the back fence was put up to help curb the theft problem that this hotel has and has not slowed down theft at this hotel one bit. He also stated that the other hotels in the area do not have the problems this hotel has. Almost seems as if this hotel's staff is fronting organized crime. I personally walked the grounds and found one secirity camera but all this camera would be able to see is the outside pool area. My wife has been in contact with the hilton corporate office concerning the happenings and the way we were purely dismissed. I only hope that one day when something as this happens to the management of this chain, they remember how they treat the patrons of their chain. I'm sure they sleep well at night knowing they have a steady income from outside sources. Just my personal thoughts. We will never stay here again, nor will we visit any hotel in this chain. There are several other chain type hotels owned by Hilton, and if they are anything like this I would avoid at all cost! Our safety was not protected, nor was our property. The general manager of this particular hotel went out of his way to avoid us, he wouldn't even make eye contact when addressed by my husband and I! I would think they would have immediately contacted this so called night \"security officer\" to find out exactly what he was doing while our vehicle was broken into. The worst part is, whomever broke out the back window had to pull right up beside us to load the back seats and contents of our vehicle! You could see where they had pulled the seats in order to load them.....didn't it raise a red flag when the security officer or front desk person saw a vehicle pull into the parking lot directly in front of the hotel and leave their car running while they broke out the back window and crawled through to steal our back seats and other things....this wasn't something that could have been accomlished quickly. The estimated time it took was well over 15 minutes!!!! I'm sorry, but somebody noticed something that worked at this hotel!!!!

Oversized lobby contains many couches, chairs, to allow evening socializing. I did not notice one family with children during my stay. Room is pleasantly appointed and contained a refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker. Each floor landing contains couches, chairs and table- nice touch.

I called down to the clerk and he said \"oh they upgraded you because you're a Hilton Honors member - you're in a suite\". I almost felt insulted - I know the difference in a \"suite\" and a queen - why not just tell me at check-in that you don't have my room because you overbooked? I told him I wanted the room I reserved because nobody in my family would want to sleep on a sofa bed. He said ok come on down and we'll \"downgrade\" you (jokingly). He gave us a queen room, but it was a handicap room which would be ok other than the shower was a walk-in, which meant a wet floor after every use. It was also a nasty shower (I took pics). The overall feel of this hotel was dirty for me. Starting in the lobby, the tile floors were dirty the whole time we were there (3 nights). The mattresses were not comfortable and the bedding only had a thin sheet and a thick comforter. What happened to putting a blanket in between? I did speak to the clerk at the desk the next day and asked if he could let me know if a Non-smoking queen room became available, but of course, it did not.

The drivers side window was broken and they broke my console trying to steal my CD player. Keep in mind this happened in bright day light. I went inside to tell the front desk. The on duty manager was there and he acted like he wasn't surprised. He told me that this happens frequently and it is hard to prevent it. I never recieved an apology or anything from the manager.

He said since all these hotels butt up next to i-35 it is easy for criminals to get away quick and far within minutes. The hotel does have security, but they dont start work until 7 pm every night.

We were only in Dallas a couple of nights to see a hockey game and paid $69.00 a night. Overall I was pleased with the accommodations though I did encounter some minor inconveniences. The room was very clean and spacious. Both my father and I commented that the beds were probably the most comfortable we ever slept in. The room had everything we needed (desk, refrigerator, coffee maker, hair dryer, microwave, free USA Today, etc.). The bathroom was of average size and had plenty of towels and amenities. The television had a suitable number of channel selections. Unlike other reviewers, I did not notice any noises from the air conditioner units. Elevator service was very quick as there are only 8 floors in the hotel. The lobby area was large and had several comfortable chairs. The breakfast buffet was great. It only cost $9.95 and was open from 6-10 am. I enjoyed the free chocolate chip cookies that were served during the evening hours. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and attentive. I used the free shuttle service twice to downtown Dallas and American Airlines Center and barely had to wait at all. There are not any nearby shopping centers or restaurants within walking distance, just some major hotels, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why they have the free shuttle. I did have some minor complaints. The hot tub was ice cold both days I was there. After touring Dallas all day I looked forward to relaxing in the hot tub, which was a factor in choosing this hotel. Even after the staff was informed that the hot tub water was cold, it was still cold the next day. The Pavilion Pantry was an insulting rip-off. I wanted to purchase a 12 ounce can of soda and was told that it would cost me $1.50! Even though I was thirsty and had plenty of money, I refused to purchase the can of soda out of principle. I find it odd that six 12 ounce cans of soda will cost pretty much the same as a full breakfast buffet at the HGI. I understand that hotel pantries have a larger mark-up than most retail stores, but $1.50 for a tiny can of soda was unbelievable. Even charging just 75 cents would still be a huge profit for the hotel. It was the little things like that which demonstrate some needed improvement in customer respect and reevaluation of pricing policies by management. In summation, I think I got a good deal for the price I paid and the free shuttle service was a big plus. If I return to Dallas in the future, I will stay here again. Marc T.

We brought our stuff to the room and then went to the restaurant where the manager curtly told us that they were no longer serving food, that it did not matter what the woman at the front desk said, and then turned his back on us and left. The woman at the desk could provide little other information on restaurants in the area so we ended up driving around for an hour till we found something. The hotel itself was bland and looked a little soiled. Temperatures inside seemed to be in the 60's. The room was adequate but not more. There is an athletic center and business center and the tiniest outdoor pool you will probably ever see. There is plenty of parking and the highway is easy to reach. It is an ok place to stay.

Plus, were this hotel not right next to the Hilton Anatole, I might say it's not in such a great looking neighborhood (unlike a previous reviewer, I did not see any vagrants in the area). My room was large, quiet, very clean and very comfortable. The bed and shower were both great. I did have to switch rooms during my stay due to a dead air conditioner (not too surprised...

There is also a complimentary shuttle service every 30 minutes (although it only goes to downtown Dallas... if you need to go to the airport, you have to take a cab). The only negative aspect was that some of the staff members were not competent enough. For instance, when asking for information about the city or tours, the lady at the front desk had to check the Internet in her computer! It seems she didn't find much in there, so she suggested me to search in the pamphlet shelf by myself. Another example: one night I went to the business center and the browser was requesting a password to get connected. I called a woman at the front desk to help me; then she came to check the computer however did not know the password, or the way to get it.

First I will say that this area, in general, is not very safe. While we were there we were approached twice in the parking lot by people asking for money and a truck was vandalized in the hotel parking lot. There were people begging on the street corners. I would not have gone out alone after dark but there were 3 of us so we felt a bit safer. There were no restaurants within walking distance but the hotel had a restaurant that we didn't try. For a woman traveling alone this is not the place to stay unless you are willing to eat hotel food. The room was large with a king-size bed and sofa-sleeper. The room and bathroom were very clean. The TV was not the greatest with a fuzzy screen and static in the sound. The air conditioner did not work at all but we didn't complain since it wasn't that hot during our stay. It's a bit unfair to complain about these things since we didn't tell anyone and give them a chance to fix it but it does imply that the hotel isn't real new. I was told it had opened 4 months ago but I think it must have just converted from another hotel brand. The outdoor pool was very small but there was a nice size exercise room.
