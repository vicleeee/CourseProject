The fan works but the AIR CONDITIONING is OFF. Nowhere is this hotel policy disclosed. I don't know about you but to me a perfectly running air conditioning unit is a must at a hotel i choose to stay in. Complained but was told it was hotel policy.

Also, maybe they cannot get rid of the group of tattooed cracks permanently sitting-in exactly in front of the hotel entrance (I regularly visit Madrid, and personally verified they're always there - month after month after month).

By \"small\" I mean than your single room can be so short that beyond your bed you can't even fit a chair; and so narrow that if you open your suitcase flat on the floor, it will fill all the remaining space, and you'll have to stay on your bed. The same architectural style applies to the bathroom as well.

From TA reviews and our familiarity with Madrid, we felt we knew what to expect, but our expectations were exceeded. Packages with this hotel were much cheaper than with any other central Madrid property. So I concur with many of the other reviews and offer some thoughts of my own. I recommend this hotel if you get a good deal (below 90 eur/night w/brkfst for 2) and it fits your needs/interests. We've previously paid 70 to 80 euros at central Madrid properties without breakfast that are less convenient to transport, etc. Location: the busiest part of the Gran Via, Madrid's showplace avenue from maybe 1920 to 1970. (NYC's Times Sq or LA's Hollywood Blvd are good analogies.) In the last 20-30 years, Gran Via's primacy was lost to newer developments elsewhere in Madrid. Today (a la Times Sq), there's some rebound, producing a mix of 1960's-era storefronts, H&M, Starbucks, Western Union, discount luggage, Zara, McDonald's and lottery ticket stands. Sidewalks are packed with international tourists, \"bridge and tunnel\" crowds from smaller towns in Spain, recent immigrants, and hurried people who work or live in central Madrid. Super convenient for Metro (Gran Via stop is right in front), shops, food, nightlife and sights, but you're in a crush of diverse humanity. We love that, but some might be overwhelmed. Not a \"neighborhood\" feel; more like 6th ave in midtown Manhattan. Property: decor is locked in the 70s, but clean. Ex: bathrooms have 70s marble, rooms have wood laminate floors. Water was lukewarm during morning \"shower rush.\" 13 inch TV. Breakfast room was cheery and the morning buffet was awesome. Basically feels like a nice Spanish hotel from the 80s that hasn't made the leap ahead seen in much of the country, but whose staff keeps it clean and efficiently run. Pay for internet on 2 PCs in the lobby or go to cheaper internet/int'l calling spot around the corner. Staff: Friendly and helpful, but rushed during peak check-in/out times. Housekeepers and breakfast staff were efficient and perky. I got the impression much of the staff joined the hotel when the decor was still fresh; it's not the 20-ish, recent-immigrant folks found at many European hotels these days. Other thoughts: Yes, a side street around the corner has prostitutes outside at night. I remember being surprised by that on a previous Madrid trip. Not representative of the area, and easy to avoid.

Left to myself, I would have booked another hotel. My single room was quite small and dark, with no place to open a suitcase other than the bed. The closet was adequate to hang a few shirts and trousers, but not large enough to store a suitcase out of the way. There was no luggage stand. As a result, I had to move my bags around the room as I dressed or got ready for bed. The small twin bed was relatively comfortable. The bathroom was an oddly-configured, long space. The vanity area and the bath/shower were sufficient, but the commode\u00b4s placement in a narrow part of the room made for inconvenient, if not uncomfortable, use. The bathroom fixtures and tile were quite dated and worn. Nonetheless, the bathroom was generally clean, as was the rest of the room. My room looked into an interior patio, which did eliminate street noise from the bustling Gran V\u00eda.

I guess that set the tone for the rest of my stay, as the staff appeared to show a level of respect for the lone female traveller from Down Under. I found the weekend doorman rude, and he did not seem to do anything but glare at people and walk in and out of the lobby. He did not even open the door for me or help me with the lifts, even when he saw me struggling with my suitcase. The other doorman was helpful though, and friendly. I did not have any difficulties at all with the staff at reception --- I guess that if you make an effort to speak their language, they make an effort to be helpful as well. In terms of the SMELL, it is bloody awful. It was probably chlorine, but it was so strong it would stick to your skin and hair. It did not help that tha room was so tiny and the airconditioning always on HOT, even when you put it on cool. Faulty? To me it was a good thing that they turn them off at night as it would suffocate you. The combination of the smell and the heat was not good or healthy at all, and the only time you can actually breathe and enjoy sleeping is when you're not in your room! Also, it did not help that a group of loud English speaking people were staying next door to me. Single female travellers, beware. If you turn right towards the McDonalds corner of the hotel, I just found out yesterday that it is a meeting place for ladies of the night. Stay out if you don't want to be mistaken as one. I guess the hotel has read the reviews here and is actually making changes in terms of security --- the hotel gives a list of do's and dont's regarding people's belongings, and the front entrance is locked from midnight. Just ring the bell outside and you'd be let in immediately. Forget the hotel cafe -- it is now permanently closed in the evenings. So much for the Hemingway experience! The TV is also hard to operate, and those with children should be extra vigilant with the remote controls. ALL programmes are uncensored. The cheapest taxis would be the ones waiting out in the streets. The ones they call for you are aware of your tourist status, so charge you more than necessary. Forget the business centre. Unless you are actually holding a conference at the hotel, the only business centre available to you is one of the two PCs at the lobby with internet access --- and yes, you guessed it --- not free! It costs 3 Euros for an hour, and 2 Euros for 30 minutes. International calling cards also do not work at the hotel --- ask the tired but patient phone operator. The 43 code they give you is only for making collect calls. There are telefonicas on the Gran Via, so that should do the trick if you want to save money.

No, you can't open up the windows because you're on the equivalence to 42nd Street in New York. Yes, the carpets are stained. Yes, the walls are too. Yes, the paint is peeling. Yes, the curtains are ripped. We had to jerry-rig a bunch of safety pins through the curtain to keep it held together and thus the neon lights from shining in. The pins, no doubt, are still there. Yes, the staff is rude and unaccommodating. Yes, they are doing construction on the hotel and therefore, no you will not get to take your siesta.

In Madrid, I stayed at the Tryp Gran Via Hotel. My experience was excellent. The location of this Hotel is in the Upper site of Gran V\u00eca Avenue, very near Alcal\u00e0 St. and Plaza La Cibeles. You can walk to Museo del Prado and to Puerta del Sol. Besides de Hotel you can find shops and cafeterias. The room was very clean, and we ask for a non-smoking and in a quiet site of the hotel, and the room fills our requirements. The personnel very courteous. The price is very reasonable, for a three star hotel, but you can find special promotions in different sites in Internet.

The location is fantastic, walking distance to many nice shops, and tourist attractions. The cost may seem a little high, and the rooms have some wear and tear, but overall I would stay there again. The rooms were cleaned daily and the hotel staff were all friendly. The bathrooms were very clean and large in size. Could use a carpet shampoo and fresh paint. Restaurants and department stores are conveniently located nearby and there was always a doorman there to greet us on return, except in the late hours when you ring the bell. There are prostitutes on the streets, but not at the hotel, they are around the corner and are easily identifiable and thus easy to avoid. All you have to do is walk the other direction where all the huge shops are located. The beds are small but I am 6'3\" and did not have a problem sleeping. Gran Via is a major thoroughfare, so there is alot of traffic. The noise is not as bad as I expected, it was hardly noticeable unless the window was open. The first picture is the street in front of the Hotel. If you look closely you can see the Hotel Gran Via sign on the right - it is a long vertical sign and is easily noticed when walking up and down the street. At night the sign is well lit and you can see it walking from any direction.", "Date": "December 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cStifling hot, airconditioned turned off at night in August\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3904443", "Content": "When I awoke stifling in the middle of the night covered with sweat, I called the front desk and the man on duty said the airconditioning was turned off for a certain number of hours on manager's orders.

It is very clean and you get what you need. It has a security box for 1 euro. It is true that it can be noisy but if you take ear stoppers that problem goes away. Madrid is a great city and everyone goes out really late so there is a lot of activity until 3 or 4 in the morning. The breakfast at the hotel is good. I recommend you have dinner at Larios Cafe (cuban restaurant) it is excellent and it is not too expensive. They have a live band and it is very nice. After dinner you can go downstairs here the DJ is to dance the night away. Another excellent Restaurant for Paella is Restaurante los Galagos. For Tapas there is a great little place called Taberna El Tablao not a touristic place, more local). Other nice and inexpensive places to eat: Madrid Uno and there is a Place called \"VIPS\" and it has good and inexpensive food. It is the type of restaurant like Pizzeria Uno here in the US. They have salads, hamburguers, sandwiches, etc....a little bit of everything While we were in Madrid we visted The Palacio Real (very impressive). The guided tour is 9 euros per person. Other places to see: Puerta de Alcala, Cibeles, Puerta del Sol, parque del Campo del Moro, Teatro Real. Side trips: Toledo is a nice place to go to. We took a tour for half a day, I reccomend the all day tour. The half a day tour is 40 euros per person but I think that the tour is too fast. You do not have enough time to enjoy the scenery. Another nice city to go to is Alcala de Henares. (you can go via train, it costs 4.25 euros). This is the where Miguel Cervantes lived. It is nice place to go walk around.
