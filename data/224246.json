This hotel was ok compared to the rest we've stayed in. It was also more expensive but considering that it was in Coral Gables, you couldn't get a better price anywhere else nearby in Miami. The hotel is a little old fashioned, old fittings etc., the lamps by the beds in my room (401) had short circuits but we didn't let that bug us too much. I liked that it was a coin laundry service so we didn't have to travel back home with a bunch of dirty clothing! The breakfast was ok, nice selections, the breakfast staff were AMAZING! By far, the most courteous bunch of ladies, always keeping their eye open if anything was running out and very quick to clean up any spills (i made a BIG one by the waffle maker) and they were so kind and polite. I'm sorry I didn't get their names but they all deserve a raise! The parking lot near the lobby was very small, we'd try to get back at a decent hour so we didn't have to park downstairs where our car was out of view. I didn't like that too much.The front staff was also helpful. I was expecting a FedEx package and they happily accepted on my behalf, no problems or additional cost at all. That service was very accommodating to me It's a little far away from all the nice shopping etc. maybe like 15-20 minutes away. We were used to staying at the Howard Johnson in Hialeah which was cheaper and was mere feet away from nice shopping, but the service was no where near as good as the Hampton Inn. We did some major shopping and also packed large items to ship back home and used the trolleys back and forth with our boxes etc. to our leisure. No one looked at us funny or gave us any problems or asked what we were doing.

The rates were very reasonable and the hotel was 20 minutes away from South Beach. The room was nice and clean. The beds were clean and comfortable. The meals were typical of the Hampton Inn breakfasts. The women tending to the breakfast area were nice and courteous. They were on the ball and were always refilling the containers and cleaning the tables and providing good service. That was the extent of the good service. The front desk was not as helpful. When we checked in, we thought the rooms came with a refrigerator and microwave, at least the website seemed to say so. When we got there, the front desk said that was not the case. If we wanted, they could put what we have in a main refrigerator that only the employees have access to. I guess that was nice, it would have been nicer to have more options. That seems to be the extent of their service. We used the vending machines and the laundry facilities and they weren't working too well either. The bottle got stuck in the machine and the front desk said that was too bad. We should try fishing for it with a ruler or something. In other words, it was our problem, not theirs. In the laundry facility, the dryer didn't work. We reported it to the front desk and they said, \"try the other one.\" Again, it was our problem, not theirs. To summarize, I think this is a practical option in Miami. The rooms are nice and comfy. Parking is ample. They even have an underground garage, which was nice in the hot weather. Service though, in general, could be much better. I've stayed in a lot of Hampton Inns and this probably was the Hampton Inn that would rate lowest in terms of service (except for the breakfast area).

It's a very, very nice Hampton Inn. The rooms are very quiet, I never heard our neighbors. The facility is very modern and they are actually renovating it currently. Also, the staff is friendly. The bed and pillows were not very comfortable, both my wife and I had trouble getting comfortable on the bed. The air conditioner works very well to keep the room cool (which is very important in Miami!), but it's also quite loud. The hotel's 24-hour fitness center has a descent treadmill and a fairly good cross-trainer/elliptical machine, but it is otherwise not very good (I'm big time into fitness, so my standards are very high). The fitness center has no free weights and a few machines (which I didn't use). The floor leaves very little room for someone to stretch, do abs, etc. The entire room is only big enough for about 3 people to be in at the same time (although, as small as it is, I felt a little awkward with one other person in the room). There is only one TV and no headphones, so try to get there early so you will have it to yourself. The desirability of the location will depend on your goals. The hotel is about one block off US Highway 1 (a/k/a \"Useless 1\"), which has very bad traffic just about constantly. We had an appointment in Coconut Grove, so this hotel was perfect for us. Also, we love the Miami Zoo and this location is fairly close to the zoo as far as distance (but, again, you have to deal with US-1 traffic). If you're heading to the beaches, Hallandale, Sunny Isles, etc., then this location might not be the best for you. Finally, this location has free self-parking!

I wanted a hotel near the campus so I could avoid some of the morning traffic. I also wanted a decent rate (in a typically overpriced area) and a clean room. I have made several trips to the campus, and have had mixed success on finding a room that fits those needs. On several previous trips here I stayed at a Ramada Inn near the Dadeland Mall, as I reported in other reviews, but that hotel is no longer a Ramada, nor does it offer economical rates. I was not impressed by the reviews of several other hotels and motels near the campus, so I extended the radius for my search. The Hampton Inn Coconut Grove was available for about $120 per night. It's a few miles from campus. It's also north of the campus, which meant I would be opposing the heavier morning traffic flow. I reserved two nights using the non-refundable rate to save a little money. I do not like non-refundable rates, but I was fairly certain my plans would not change. The hotel is easy to access from South Dixie Highway (US1). Because US1cuts diagonally through the square grid street layout of Miami, there are some odd traffic patterns on the side streets. You can se the hotel from US1, but it is possible to miss the turn into the hotel. When I arrived, I received a friendly greeting, and I checked in quickly. My room was clean and comfortable. It was a typical size with two queen beds. The room includes breakfast (biscuits, scrambled egg patties, ham, yogurt, fruit, bagels, juice, coffee, etc.) like other Hampton Inns. The breakfast area was clean and well maintained. There was also a guest reception the night I checked in, and beer, wine, soda and snacks were served. The hotel has two parking areas. One is open at al times. The other is a secured garage that requires a room key to access. I parked in the garage both nights, and I felt my car was safe. The hotel offers free high-speed Internet, both wired and wireless. Access was reliable and quick. The Coconut Grove Metrorail station is two blocks away. There are a few small groceries and mini marts nearby, as well as a gas station and some convenience restaurants. The heart of Coconut Grove is just over a mile away. I gave this hotel a 4, but that is because I reserve a 5 rating for truly exceptional hotel experiences.

What is worse, is that when I called the hotel after seeing the charge on my credit card they asked me if I had a cancellation number and declined to reverse the charge to my credit card when I said I did not. Let me explain. I booked a room here for one night to arrive on November 10. I had my meeting pushed back a couple of days so I changed the reservation to November 12 instead. When I arrived at the hotel on the 12th it was about 50/50 as to whether my meeting would be canceled or not, so rather than check in I decided to work in the lobby. I received a call that my meeting was canceled so I packed up my laptop and headed for the airport. On my way out the door I stopped at the front desk and told the clerk that I would not need my room and would not be checking in. I got on a plane and returned home. A couple of weeks later while doing my company expenses I noticed that I had been charged for the room on my Amex bill. There had been a couple of times in the past when I had forgotten to cancel my room by mistake at other hotels when business plans had changed last minute and in every case I was able to call the hotel, apologize, and have the charge reversed even though I had forgotten. In this case I called the hotel and spoke to the Front Desk Manager and explained what had happened. The Manager asked me if I had a cancellation number and refused to reverse the charge without one. When I called the Hilton family Guest Services Line they looked up the activity on this stay and said that not only had the front desk clerk not canceled my reservation, she checked me into my room at 4:15 PM, about the same time I left for the airport. I have a call into the General Manager of the hotel and I hope the issue will be resolved in a satisfactory manner. I am a Hilton Diamond Preferred member (I travel too much and I try to stay at Hilton family properties when I do) and as a last resort the Guest Services Agent has promised me that I will get a credit on my Amex account if the hotel will not reverse the charge.

We spent several days at this property. We had a room with two double beds on the third floor. The room looked down on the parking lot and was the last room on the floor next to the housekeeping closet. I was impressed by the staff at the hotel. The cleaning crew was always kind and friendly. They honored the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign when I posted it on the door and were quick to move their cart out of the way when the baby and I needed to get down the hall with the stroller. The room itself was clean, but nothing spectacular--typical motel layout with a small circular table and two chairs and a long dresser with a desk and drawers. The television was a long wide screen flat panel which was nice. There was a tub with shower and the amenities were adequate. The bathroom was clean and the water pressure was good. The breakfast each morning was very good. They also had bags at the front desk for people on the go with a muffin, granola bar and bottle of water. The attendants in the breakfast area were very friendly and helped me since it was not easy to maneuver the stroller and get my food. They always had bagels, muffins, pastries, fruit, yogurt and cereals but the hot items alternated. One day there was Canadian bacon and another day there was sausage. The eggs were round disks that were not too appetizing but on the day they had tortillas there was an egg scramble that was quite tasty. There was coffee and juice. I found it to be a very clean area and always well-stocked. The attendants made sure that no one went without and more than once I saw them go to the back to get something at the request of a guest. They gave my grandson cookies one day that they retrieved from an area off of the kitchen. There was a small exercise room and I saw people there using the equipment. There was a pool and a hot tub area but I did not use it. I saw a family out there one afternoon. The hotel is not in an area that is especially pedestrian friendly. I had wanted to take a long walk with the baby in the stroller but I found that the sidewalks were not always continuous. One would travel along the front of an apartment complex for awhile and then suddenly the sidewalk would stop requiring one to push through gray sand and over gnarled roots or very close to the traffic. The hotel faces the back of a small strip shopping center. Inside that center is a Subway and a Dunkin Donuts, a pet store, and a few other businesses. There is also a Pollo Tropicale fast food place and a gas station with a bakery inside of it. There is a Burger King across a busy highway. Beside the hotel is a church with a school and on the other side of it is a place called Berries in the Grove. We ate almost all of our meals there. The food was very good. There is an interior patio so it is larger than it looks. On first glance I only thought it was a bar, but I found the food to be good and lots of families and children were there so they had high chairs and were receptive to the baby. If you are going to be in this area it is really good to have a car as there is not much to do within reasonable walking distance with children. The pedestrian difficulties made my stay there less than wonderul, but this was no fault of the hotel property. If you need a place on business I would think the Hampton would be ideal. The internet connectivity is free. There is no charge for parking. The hotel staff is great. Upon arrival we were tired and the front desk staff gave us menus to four places that provided free delivery to the hotel. The first place they recommended was closed (Basil closes at 5 p.m.) so we ended up ordering from Que Pizza. I would not recommend it. They delivered a pizza that was NOT what we ordered but by that time (45 minute delivery time) we were too hungry to protest.

The rooms are great and the breakfast is good. In fact all was going well right until the fire alarm started to go crazy on Sunday morning. As a fire alarm should be - it was loud and high pitched. I guess after the first half dozen my patience grew thin but after a dozen or so I did indeed have a pretty severe headache. As there seemed no end to them we decided to leave the hotel early and when we got down in the lobby I discovered we were not the only complainers. After putting our cruise bound suitcases in the rental I returned to the desk and informed the clerk that I certainly was not 100% satisfied with my stay (thumping headache - forced to leave early , etc) and asked for a full refund per hotel policy. I was informed that the best the hotel could offer was a $40 discount on a $220 bill. I refused the discount and later in the day called Hampton Inn 800 number from the cruise ship before it departed to tell my saga to a supervisor. Much to my surprise the supervisor immediately agreed with me that I should receive a 100% refund and did not agree with the hotel that the fire alarm problem could be categorized as an \"act of god\". She informed me that the hotel would receive notification of my complaint and would be given a three day opportunity to refund the 1 day stay and failing that I would receive the refund directly from the corporate office. On my return from the cruise my credit card had been credited with the refund from the hotel. I guess the moral of the story is that if one does have a justified complaint about a stay at a hotel chain offering 100% guarantee don't be to fast to accept a minimal discount. If in doubt call corporate and tell them your yarn! - Please note - The hotel never once made any announcements regarding the false fire alarms which I found quite strange.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cReliable hotel for the budget traveller\u201d", "Author": "jrfras", "ReviewID": "UR13949220", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel because I wanted a budget-conscious place where I could easily get to a conference in downtown Miami (10 - 15 minutes away) and enjoy South Beach (25 minutes away).

In my previous visits to Miami I had stay at South Beach/Downtown hotels, although I have nothing to complain about the downtown Hyatt or the (now extintct) Fontainebleau Hilton, after this recent experience I do prefer the Hampton Inn. The hotel is just next to US1, really convinient to get further south or up north, it is only a 5 minute drive to Coconut Grove. The staff is really firendly, from your arrival at the front desk, the servers at the continental breakfast, the maids, everyone is always happy to help. I got room 613, on the top floor, one king bed, 32\" LCD TV, a mini fridge and microwave oven (that I did't use), spacious bathroom with shower (no tub), a mid size closet with in room safe (I understand that not all rooms have a safe). The view out the window is not great, but who travels to stay in the room looking out the window. The rate includes free self service parking, free continental breakfast, free high speed internet and free use of the busisness center, were they have two PC computers with laser printers. There is also an outdoor pool with a jacuzzi. What I liked most about the hotel, was the do it yourself concept. There is no bellboys or concierge, when you arrive you just get one of the carts and take your suitcases up to your room, also the free self service parking is a luxury in Miami very hard to find. The only con of the hotel is that the airconditioning is a little bit to noisy. If you like shopping you will find that the The Village of Merrick Park and the Shops at Sunset Place are close by as well as the Dadeland Mall and further south The Falls. The most complete mall I could say that is Aventura up north and Saw Grass Mills is one of the largest outlet malls in the US.

We wanted a hotel that was reasonably priced, clean and close to the Miami tourist attractions. This hotet met all of those criteria and more. I did hours and hours of research trying to find a hotel in Miami. Finally I ran across this hotel and decided it looked like it would work for us. I was 100% right. Our stay was outstanding right from the beginning. We had stayed up late the night before and when our plane landed at 9:30am I called the hotel to see if we could get in our room early. They said our room was already ready. It was so great to check into our room early and take a nap before starting our sightseeing. The room was impeccably clean. Hampton Inn has very comfortable beds with really nice white comforters. We also had a big flat screen TV. The hotel has just about every extra you could want. It has a pool, hot tub and computers with internet access. Parking is free and we always got a close space. The neighboorhood seemed safe. There is a stop on the Miami's metro system a block away. The breakfast is free and has a different hot choice every day in addition to all the usual continental breakfast items like cereal, muffins, bagels, fruit, juices and coffee. The front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful. Another thing I really liked was how easy it was to get where we wanted to go. It took about 15 minutes to get there from the airport. It's right off of US 1 which got us to downtown very quickly. The coconut grove and Miracle Mile shopping areas are each about 5 minutes away. It took us about 20 minutes to get to South Beach. Plenty of restaurants in the near vicinity. The hotel provided a very nice map with a list of all the places you might need in the area. I don't know why you would want to deal with the hassle of staying in any of the beach areas when you could stay here in a nice, clean hotel with great service and amenities.

I had requested a larger room on a higher floor away from any possible noise & this we were given & it was appreciated.

There was a large tv to watch the news if you wished & although the sound was turned up it was not too loud.
