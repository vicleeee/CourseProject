{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great hotel in great location We are a senior couple who stayed in the Maria Elena Palace Hotel in Madrid for 2 nights in early October. We just happened upon a great rate of 75.00 euro per night, and boy, did we luck out! The room was on the small side but perfectly adequate for the two of us, and very spotless. The bathroom was very modern and also spotless. Plenty of hot water for the shower. It was only 2 blocks from the Sol metro station and even closer to Sevilla Station. We managed just fine with our rolling cases, coming from the airport on the metro. We would definitely give this hotel high marks and would stay again at that rate in a heartbeat. It was also very close to a good restaurant, Finca Susanna, where we loved the food so much, we ate there twice!", "Date": "Nov 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR631902788", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mimiccr"}, {"Content": "Great central location Location couldn't be better.

First of all lets discuss its much vaunted 'location'. The reality is that it is on a side street just off one of the scuzziest streets leading off Puerto Sol. If your idea of location is having to walk past sex shops, piercing and tattoo parlours, shops sell questionable goods, pinball arcades, fast food joints, crowds of probationers queuing up outside the police station, ladies of the night plying their trade etc. then this place is for you. If you want to be greeted by things to delight the eye and the senses, look elsewhere.Someone said that the rooms were huge. Hello! the room size was a huge disappointment - barely room to walk around the bed.My most heartfelt criticism though, must go for the beds, in this case a double. Perhaps the hardest, must unyielding platform I have ever slept on, with the exception, when I was a backpacking teenager, when I slept on top of a brick wall!Complaints brought forth no help whatsoever from the desk staff.The breakfast was abundant in its ordinariness and I would suggest going elsewhere.Sorry folks, but that's my take on the Maria Elena Palace Hotel, Madrid.", "Date": "Aug 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR399636982", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "GrahamLDN"}, {"Content": "Excellent hotel, good location This hotel is in a road near Grand Via and Sol and is hence in a perfect location for the central sights of Madrid. As it is down a side street, there is no noise which means a peaceful sleep at night.The rooms are well appointed, clean and well maintained. The bed was large and comfortable. The only downside was that the room was a bit small and there was nowhere to sit down in the room to read a book / relax apart from on the bed.The staff were very efficient - we initially thought that there was a problem with the air conditioner, and after contacting reception someone came up straight away. In fact, we realised afterwards that the aircon cuts out if the window is open - clearly a sensible idea.Madrid has everything for a short city break - the Prado etc, good parks, restaurants (we ate in an interesting Peruvian restaurant in Cheuca, Theatriz in Salamanca and the cheap and interesting Bazaar in Cheuca), bars and excellent Tapas! We even took a day trip to Segovia on the high speed AVE train, arriving in under 40mins...The hotel provided a perfect location to return to after our various sightseeing trips around the City.

I was really pleased with our choice. A beautiful hotel in a quite place close to Puerto Del Sol (2 mins to walk).The hotel was realy clean, the rooms spacious and the hotel staff were very helpful when asked anything. We did have the breakfast every morning and although this was expensive it was good, they even made hot boiled eggs to order every morning for my husband! For a city hotel this is excellent, we couldnt believe how big the rooms were. When I booked online direct with the hotel we asked for a non smoking and quiet room. I dont know if it made a difference but it was nice a quite, we even had a balcony overlooking the front of the hotel.I would highly recomend this hotel, it has been one of our best choices over the years of city hotels.If travelling by metro, like we did, we found the easiest route was line 8 to Colombia, line 9 to Principle de Vergara and then line 2 to Sevilla. I would recomend coming off at Sevilla rather than Sol as this is a much quiter station and equal distance to the hotel.

Hence to me, boring. The rooms are nicely furnished in a very traditional style and very clean with modern baths. The location is good, on a quiet street around the corner from Puerta del Sol, Madrid's main square. Near pedestrian streets. A couple of sex shops on adjacent street, but they are the upscale type, not the sleezy type. The tourist books refer to this street as a red light district, which is a major exageration. One probably could see more prostitutes near the Holiday Inn! The large fancier hotels are a couple of blocks away, but they are on busy, noisy streets.A couple of notes of caution. The part of the hotel I stayed in had a persistant humming noise, as if high voltage lines were running through a shaft in the hallway. The noise was especially noticeable at night. So if you are a light sleeper, without earplugs, beware of the rooms numbered _0_, like 507 that run along one side of the hotel and face the back. My sisters stayed in 405 that faced the front street and the noise wasn't really noticeable there. The staff at the front desk were minimally helpful day and night and not especially friendly. Seemed irritated to have to help you and their English was only fair (but way better than my Spanish!!) But they were never rude.Breakfast is an ample hot and cold buffet but it is 12 euros a person.

Its five minutes walk from Puerta Del Sol and a quick Metro journey from The Prado and the Palacio Real. The staff could not have been more helpful and the room was spotless with a huge six foot bed and generous bathroom. The Hotel faces onto an ordinary looking street so we took an inside room which was very quiet and overlooked the internal atrium of the Hotel.The breakfast was very good with fresh juice, cereal, cheese, rolls, fruit and a hot selection.The reception staff recommended the Barbarroja restaurant in Cava San Miguel Street (near Puerta Del Sol) which was excellent with a great value Tourist Menu for \u9227?3. For a very cheap Oriental meal try WOK just around the corner from the Hotel. Also do not miss coffee and pastry for \u9227?.70 at La Mallorquina in Puerta Del Sol, the place is always packed and a great experience. There are lots of good shops near the Puerta Del Sol which looks good lit up at night as does the Plaza Mayor which is a stones throw away from Puerta Del Sol. Put aside at least two hours for the Museo del Prado and Thyssen -Bornemisza museums as well as the Palacio Real but the El Rasto Sunday flea market can be given a miss unless you really want rip off CD\u9225\u6a9a or videos.The Metro is the way to get around in Madrid but BEWARE ! of pick pockets especially on Saturdays and Sundays. They push you when you are getting on or off the Metro and are looking to where you are going. So keep your hand on your wallets and bags when are getting on or off to the Metro and you will be ok!

The Concierge was more than happy to book restaurants, taxi's, help with directions and find tickets to 'sold-out' venues.Hotel is located in a quiet side street in an extremelly central location.

Air conditioning/heating worked fine  windows that fully open .Didnt sample the restaurant, but drinks at the bar were well priced  service attentive.Back to 'location'. It's about as Central as you can get without being on a busy (noisy) main street.

They seemed well behaved/restrained, werent approaching anybody and could go unnoticed if you're not paying attention.

Don't get me wrong, they weren't rude, they just weren't exactly happy.The hotel looks beautiful. Our room was spotless and the bathroom was huge but like previous posts the room was hot, stuffy and there was no circulation of air - we had to resort to opening the window at nights just to get some air, and this was in January, when Madrid aint exactly warm. If you have any kind of breathing difficulties I would think twice about staying here.The location is excellent - quite quiet despite being only a couple of minutes from Puerta del Sol. There is what appears to be a Goth Club just along the road, there isn't really any noise from this (our room was at the front and not far from it), but it does mean you get some interesting characters walking along the road at 2am! But again there was no problem with this.Breakfast was good, didn't eat there apart from that.Basically if you get cold easily and can speak a couple of words of Spanish, even just hello, please and thank you then you will love this place. Little tip on Madrid - the metro system is excellent - quick, clean, well signposted and not as crowded as e.g. London's. If you fly into baracas then the metro is linked to this (ok it's a bit of a walk from some of the terminals) and it's counted as part of zone 1 / whatever they call it - so buy a 10 journey ticket from a machine for (I think??!) 6 euros 80 - meaning that a trip to Sol for this hotel is only going to cost you 0.68 euros - or roughly 40p.

I selected the Maria Elena based on other Tripadvisor reviews who mentioned how quiet the hotel was because of it's location in a small alley despite being near the Plaza del Sol and walking distance to all the major museums and palacio real. This is a real asset since Madrilenos are out until very late at night and the noise from the street can be significant. When one has arrived from a trans Atlantic flight and suffering from jet lag, having a quiet place to sleep and adjust is a major plus. The hotel is sparkling clean, with nice public rooms and excellent breakfast buffet as mentioned by others. The rooms are small but still comfortable. The bathrooms are very high tech (took a while to figure out the shower with its 6 spray nozzles, fixed shower head and hand held shower!). The room was very warm when we arrived but that was quickly resolved by opening up the windows (very high quality, when closed the noise level dropped considerably) and turning off the heater in the bathroom since apparently the air conditioning was not working. Maita and Neria in particular were very helpful receptionists with excellent English. (I had left my credit card in Granada at the parador and Maita quickly contacted them and had them shred it.) One receptionist did give us wrong directions and was less helpful with phone calls, etc. Other reviews mention the proximity to a red light district; I feel this is absolutely a non-issue. Compared to other cities (we live in San Francisco), the area is clean and filled with people. We never felt unsafe walking to the hotel and were never hassled by people. We took taxis to and from the airport as well as drove our rental car to the hotel to retrieve luggage and were able to negotiate the small alley easily and park outside the reception area. My only negative comment is that several times the housekeeping staff did not get to our rooms while we were out in the late morning and early afternoon. Because we were sleeping in the mid afternoons during the jet lag adjustment period, once our room did not get cleaned at all because we opted to sleep rather than leave to have them clean the room. So better attention to our coming and going from the room (they have electronic locks and should be able to monitor this) would have been nice. And finally, on our last night before leaving for home, we were given a different room than our earlier one. Despite asking for a non-smoking room in the original reservation, they gave us a smoking room because it was the only one with an available double rather than twin bed. This wing of the hotel is adjacent to the restaurant which is the only public smoking area and the room itself smelled mildly of cigarettes. Make sure to ask for a non-smoking room in the opposite side of the hotel away from the restaurant. Fortunately Spain and Portugal as EU countries are passing more and more restrictive smoking laws so maybe in the future we in the non-smoking majority can go to bars and restaurants without having to reek of tobacco. I noticed my very mild asthma symptoms were increased during my stay in Spain. The back portion of the hotel is very smoke free. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel as a good value for the money (make sure when comparison shopping the web sites that you include meals and VAT taxes plus any fees to make sure which offers the best value). I had booked three days via the internet but also got very good rates at the desk for the additional days I added at the beginning and end of the trip (around 130 euros for room and breakfast).", "Date": "Mar 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR782019572", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "cyssf"}, {"Content": "Loved the shower       My room", "Date": "Mar 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR696782647", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "happytrailsSanDiego"}, {"Content": "Fantastic!!!!

To be sure, however, we compared travel agent's story with the reviews found on the web: we found nothing but praise for Maria Elena Palace.Now, after having stayed for six nights around new year 2006/2007 we want to join the chorus of appreciation. Everything worked like a charm! The hotel was modern, clean and quiet. The staff was friendly and helpful. They spoke reasonably good English (and apparently managed their way in French and Italian although a group of smartass Italian tourists saw to themselves to correct their grammar) which helped things go smoothly.Even though the hotel's website mentions that double beds can only be found in suites, we got it simply by asking it on the reception. Apparently we were moved to fifth (uppermost) floor with a nice view to the Telefonica Tower. If the room was suite (which I doubt), it was terribly small - it was large by European standards, though.The location is excellent: Puerta del Sol and La Chueca were right around the corner.Lastly, we enjoyed the generous breakfast which was comfortably served until 11 AM.

We booked this hotel for our stay in Madrid at the Maria Elena Palace after reading the reviews on this site. Tripadvisor did not fail us! The location is perfect, the rooms are quiet, new, absolutely spotless, and the rates are reasonable. The only criticism you might be able to place on the hotel is that the rooms are very small - much like New York City hotel rooms. We were only in Madrid one day. So it was nice to be able to walk to the Prado and find a great place to eat. The Maria Elena Palace was a lot nicer than we were expecting for the price we paid in that neighborhood. We like to stay in the Plaza del Sol area because it is close to great restaurants, major sites, and night life. Plus, you are close to a Metro stop to get you anywhere else in the city.
