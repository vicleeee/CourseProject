I found a great rate online and booked it. Done.I easily found the hotel in its incredibly convenient location a block from the train station. I had my printed confirmation and passport at the ready. Ms. James at the front desk spoke English better than I did (in addition to her native Italian and adopted German and I'm sure a few others as well), greeted me warmly, and asked for my information. She couldn't find me in the computer and asked my confirmation. Uh oh. It turns out that there is *another* Hotel Kaiserhof on *another* Kaiserstrasse near *another* Hauptbanhoff in a suburb of Frankfurt and I had accidentally booked that one. Rather than point out that this was entirely my fault, Ms. James gave me a password to use the computer upstairs to try to cancel that reservation. When it was too late to cancel online she let me use her personal cell phone to try to to cancel the other hotel without penalty (knowing that if I called using her hotel's line they surely wouldn't). Then the manager came in and called the other hotel to cancel for me , gave me a great rate and breakfast coupons, and just generally made me feel taken care of. At no point in the process did anyone point out that this was my own damn fault and they were both so incredibly nice that I knew I'd made the right decision.The room was surprisingly large for Europe, had both a bath tub and shower curtain (also a pleasant surprise), and the bed was comfortable. The breakfast was contintental plus a few hot dishes; the yogurt was particularly good. The hotel is a block from the main train station so gettting to and from the airport is a cinch, and it was walking distance to the Romerburg (old city) and Museumsufer, though if walking is not your thing you can easily catch public transport. I found the different ethnicities represented in the neighborhood lively and interesting, and the red light element was tame to non-existent.

We were in Frankfurt for 2 weeks. Location - The Hotel is located in a semi-red light district with sex shops however do not let this deter you. The people do not harass you in anyway, they are typical cruisers. It is well patroled by police at night and there is no sense of danger at all. Ironically, it is quite welcoming. It is very near the city centre (in fact its on the same stree - 10 min walk). Hotel Room - The room is an adequate size. The bathroom is clean and everything works. The room is cleaned every morning and the supervisor regularly visits to ensure approproate standards. The pillows are huge though. Noise does filter through though looking outside is interesting - good place to people watch. There is always something happening - never a dull moment. If windows are closed, you can rest peacefully. Food - The breakfast is wide ranging from eggs, cereal to salmon. The catering staff are very nice and do try to communicate in English if German is not your first language. Staff - The staff on the front desk are also very welcoming though the male staff are somewhat strange. They stare at you for ages without speaking - kind of awkward. They are avilable 24/7.

A couple of days a week Kaiserstrasse is filled with stalls selling fresh produce and German-style fast food; which seemed very popular with the be-suited German workforce and the samples we tried were great.

We went to experience the culture, the people, the food and the lifestyle of Europeans and that is exactly what we got.The city offers many different places to visit, to dine, to relax and perhaps some areas to avoid if your not as open minded as others but hey your in Germany, it is after all one of the most cultured cities of the world!! The city is full of people from different backgrounds which is what I loved because I came across people, places and foods which were of course German as well as Italian, Turkish, Greek, Spanish, Asian and British which really opens your mind to diverse cultures.Frankfurt is the financial capital of Germany so you had your sky scrapers and massive banks, buildings and monuments but amongst the city were little towns and areas which seemed completely away from the city. For example the city centre is heaving 24/7, then there is the old town which is across the bridge which is like another city, you have the West end which is similiar to some streets of London and there is so much more to see. Trust me the best thing to do is see the tourist spots first and then explore the city your way because you discover so much more than what is on the brochure. I spent 8 hours on foot immersing myself in the city and West end area and funnily enough felt like a native more than a tourist but if that isn't your thing then the tour bus and ferry ride is always available.Public transport is quick and fairly cheap so you won't have much trouble travelling around but we both opted for travelling on foot as the weather was beautiful and we were never far away from an attraction or great places to eat. The food is amazing as I lost a few pounds from the purse but gained a few in the weight department as their is such a variety of foods for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. I would recommend Thai food especially in a little Thai place called 'Thai Fun' which is 5-8 minutes walk from the train station, the food is 10 out of 10 and with such large portions at great prices I would recommed it to everyone.The bakeries are great too and cheap if you want something cold to eat and there are many great fast food places to eat all over the city.The Hotel 'Kaiserhoff' was great and I have no complaints as we only needed to sleep there. The staff were great and we appreciated the fact that they at least spoke English as in some countries English isn't an option, so the bi-lingual staff were fantastic and very friendly.The breakfast was great and there was a variety of foods available and no one went hungary in the breakfast room trust me I watched how people shovelled food in the plate. The room was clean, room service was good and yes at night there was sometimes noise coming from outside but the hotel is in the city centre surrounded by city buildings, pubs, restaurents, shops etc so in fairness a little noise is to be expected. The area was safe as no one bothers you unless you bother them and the red light district is amusing as it is the 'norm' there and Ann Summers is probably saucier! However I wouldn't bring young children to the city as there aren't many things for them to do and the parks are usually deserted.

It's in a Turkish/Indian district, so it doesn't really 'feel' like I was visiting Germany anyway. The staff was nice, but something about them was a little creepy- the male staff at least.

I could hear the conversations of people in the room next to me clearly, and whenever a door opened, it was so loud it was like someone was coming into my room.

A short walk across one minor intersection (Moselstrasse) and you are there (100m). Its in a little arcade full of Indian/Asian clothes/fabric stores.If you arrive at a similar time I would recommend sticking to this main street, as a wrong turn at that intersection can lead you up a dodgy street full of sex shops and drunk/drugged people. As I arrived so early I had to go for a walk around Frankfurt to kill a few hours. I would recommend heading up the Kaiserstrasse away from the train station. There is a Starbucks near the Mercedes Dealership about 400m from the hotel. The odd homeless person camping in the Park didn't cause me any trouble.Room wise my first three nights were at the back of the hotel overlooking...nothing interesting. Pretty quiet apart from a group of Canadian and Peruvian youths in Germany for the World Youth Day who were running around the fire escape area. Didn't bother me in the slightest.The other room I stayed in was on the top floor overlooking the main street. Now this had a nice'ish view of the street. But it can get noisy in the early mornings with drunken yelling and brawling. I think the windows are double glazed anyway so just close them and you wont hear a thing.

I will not return to this hotel!", "Date": "Feb 6, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR780266494", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "carino e pulito   showReview(23334090, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 7, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR819657334", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Lilou1983"}, {"Content": "Hotel centrico sin mas pretensiones   showReview(22895294, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR734602497", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Ayaxrm"}, {"Content": "\u813aberraschend gute Qualit\u76f2t       Zimmer", "Date": "Dec 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR268268570", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "feequent-worker"}, {"Content": "Freundlich, sauber und Zentral...   showReview(22203331, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR632438488", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SFT00"}, {"Content": "Super Preis / Leistung - Ausgezeichnetes Personal   showReview(22128220, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR471753513", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "thesheep84"}, {"Content": "Esattamente come promesso sul...   showReview(21836883, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR817929304", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Es un hotel muy bien ubicado...   showReview(20580724, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR364793733", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Gerne Wieder   showReview(19911310, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR493221008", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Kach78"}, {"Content": "Besser geht es kaum       Zimmeransicht", "Date": "Aug 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR508536991", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "RikardaSolimon"}, {"Content": "Einmaliges Preis/Leistungsverh\u76f2ltnis   showReview(19635590, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR800761780", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Gerne wieder   showReview(19635589, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR174435251", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Unglaublich GUT !!!
