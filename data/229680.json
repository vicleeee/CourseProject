We arrived at the hotel after 2-weeks driving around Andalusia and 3-hour train journey feeling very tired and ready to sleep. Previously we received an email from the hotel who said that they were instructed by the GM to upgrade us to \"The Level\", and were already impressed when they asked what sort of pillows we want (latex? down? ergonomics?) and ten other questions. But when we went to the reception, we were told that the hotel was overbooked and... We were upgraded to stay at The Suite! Our suite (The Gaudi suite) is on 17th floor with fantastic view of Barcelona. It was about 7pm when we were sitting at the living room, wondering what to do and where to eat, when the door was knocked and the room service brought complementary tapas for us! The next day when we came back to the room there were chocolates and a giant rose on our bed. A simple but very nice touch. The room is equipped with Nespresso machine (heaven for me), complimentary 'normal' coffee and tea, microwave, and a kettle (but who needs those when by being The Level customers we have access to the Level buffet which is ready from 7AM to 11PM?). The bathroom has jet shower, perfect for tired guests like us! The breakfats buffet is simply divine. Apart from normal dish, they have a specific section for Catalan food. The staffs are very friendly and speak English perfectly. When we sat down at the Level lounge, we noticed one staff entertained a 10 year-old boy who was alone as his parents were elsewhere in the hotel. We stayed previously in Melia Madrid and Sevilla, but Barcelona is simply the best! Really, the hotel has made us difficult to leave the room and wander around Barcelona!", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sussex", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "999nat", "ReviewID": "UR128242152", "Content": "I stayed here for 3 nights with my boyfriend. I booked through lastminute.com and booked a 'city view' room. When we arrived, we were on floor 5 and looked out straight into another high rise building - not quite what I was expecting. All the buildings in Barcelona are high and unless we were on level 19 or similar I can't imagine that the view would have been that spectacular. That aside, the room was a good size and comfortable. The bed was amazingly comfy and the shower was great. I was suprised that there weren't tea or coffee making facilities in the room and could have really done with that before a day of exploring the city! We never ate at the hotel but had drinks in the Q Lounge. Very good cocktails but pricey, as you'd probably expect! We only had one good meal out, that was in an Italian round the corner called Tramonti 1980. The tapas we tried everywhere was terrible which was a real disappointment. I would recommend the Hotel Melia - it's in a good location, not that noisy, and when I told staff that I couldn't work the safe box they sent someone straight up to the room to help me.

I don't understand why people complain that their room was not available when thay arrived early, of course it isn't that's why there are check-in and check-out times. And this is why we were grateful we could have any room that early. The room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom had a separate bathtub and shower (with a rainfall which was nice). I was surprised by the quality of the breakfast. In addition to fruits, cereals and pastries, the usual hot buffet and variety of delis, there was a display of local foods (including various local cheeses, and the very typical bread and tomato). I also enjoyed the live showcooking, it was worth the wait in line. As one previous poster said the restaurant was full for breakfastime. We actually had to queue to get a table and to grab any food, but the quality and the variety made up for any wait. Although the hotel is not located in the city center (Ramblas or Plaza Catalunya) it is within easy reach of the Metro and city and touristic buses. I thoroughly enjoyed the location as it was a residential area. It is within walking distance of many nice restaurants, and shopping centers including El Corte Ingles.

I would very much reccomend the level lounge. It is open all day with food, friut, hot and cold beverages and drinks. It was so nice to come back from sightseeing at the end of the afternoon and have a soda and a pastry. A couple of evenings we were tired and didn't feel like going out. The tapas and a lovely glass of wine was all that was needed for a relazing evening. Monica, the hostess, is so friendly and caring, just like Alexis. You will love her!!!

However this is something which I like as it is peaceful. I arrived in Barcelona from Madrid using the Renfe trains. Following the guidance from Google Map, I took the metro from Sants Estacio to Hospital Clinic Station. From the Hospital Clinic Station, it is a 10 minutes walk to the hotel. Ok if you do not have many luggage to drag. I will recommend another way, which I think can reduce the amount of walking, but will involve transfer to the tram. The good thing about the transport system in Barcelona is that if you started your journey with the metro, you can exit the metro and change to the bus or tram within the 75 minutes since the trip started and it is still considered as one trip. Get the T-10 ticket if you are intending to spend a few days there, its more than enough if you plan your trip well. Anyway back to the alternate route if you are arriving to Barcelona by train at Sants station and getting to this hotel. Take the L3 towards Zona Universitaria and alight at Maria Cristina and change to the T1, T2 or T3 towards Francesc Macia. That is the last stop and alight at that stop. It's a short walk to the hotel. Hope this will be useful. For the hotel, I am a melia platinum member and was upgraded to the suite. Nice of them. I enjoyed the room and amenities very much. Wireless internet was provided complimentary during my stay. Do check with the reception during check-in, they may provide, who knows. Some minor glitches - As I was staying at the executive level, I was entitled to use the executive lounge facilities for breakfast. On first day, I accidentally walked towards the general dining restaurant and provided my room number to the staff at the counter, only then I realized that it is the incorrect place. upon checking again, I was directed to the correct place, which was next to the dining restaurant. Thought its just a simple and harmless mistake, so no worries about it. Anyway the food in the lounge was nice and presentable. The shock came during checkout. The bill reflected the breakfast and I thought them that I had not dine there at all and they cannot charge me for it. I have been to many hotels and usually if you do eat there for breakfast, they will provide a charge slip for me to sign. Anyway they did remove it, but what I was not too happy about is the attitude of one of the staff at the reception when I mentioned the practice that I am used to. The one attending to me was patient and friendly, it's her colleagues attitude that sucks in my opinion. Also, as I had made my booking on the melia.com website, I was given 40EUR per day of credit to spend for room service and restaurant. During the checkout, somehow there were a lot of charges incurred were charged into the room and this credit was sort of forgotten. The point here is to remember to verify the charges and remember to ask them to apply the credit, because they will not automatically apply it. Restaurant - Had a dinner at the restaurant as I had the credit to spend. Verdict - Good service, food - average. For the location of the hotel, like I mentioned previously, I do not mind it as it is easily accessible by bus. The buses can take you to the major attractions within barcelona and the bus stop is near to the hotel as compared to metro. For shopping, the major brand names can also be found along Avendia Diagonal, in both directions. With the T-10 tickets, my wife and I had spent 3 days in Barcelona. Just plan your trip properly. Also, the timing that the trip started is also printed on the back of the ticket.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, New Jersey, United States", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable bed and delicious food!\u201d", "Author": "Nicole M", "ReviewID": "UR120786358", "Content": "I stayed here for 7 nights for a conference in the same hotel and I had a great experience.

The bedroom measured about 5 x 3 meters and was quite big. There were two very comfortable single beds side to side. The beds were new. There was a TV set, a glass top side table, a glass top desk, and a big mini-refrigerator. There was a sliding door to the wash basin and in this place there was a large closet with plenty of hangers. There was a sliding door to the toilet room, which included a bidet. There was a large walk in shower. I think this is better than a bathtub, which is prone to causing falls getting in and out of it. The bedroom had good air conditioning control and you could set the temperature digitally. The bedroom also had the light brown carpet. The breakfast buffet was great. Plenty of jamon iberico and other cold meats. You could order a fried egg or an omelet. The chocolate cake was wonderful, very moist. It was perfect with the cava. There were plenty of fruits and nuts. This was one of the best breakfast buffets we have had in Spain. Service at the hotel was very good and friendly. I have a tip for those who have never been to a Melia hotel. If you go to their website, you can apply for a Mas card, which does not cost anything. When you stay at the hotel and have the Mas card, if you are two in a room, you pay for only one breakfast buffet. You also get a Spanish newspaper delivered free to your room.

It was our first trip to Barcelona. To properly recommend this hotel, I think it's important to share a little bit about Barcelona itself. The city, unlike Madrid, is very spread out. In Madrid, everything seemed to be in walking distance and this was not the case in Barcelona. As the other reviewers said, this hotel is not in the Center of the City. However, I was GLAD not to be in the center of the city. I did not like the Ramblas (at all!!) it was cheap, filled with tourists and by far the only bad meal we ever had in Spain! The Gothic Quarter is interesting to visit and its nice to see the coast but the real highlights of Barcelona, to us, were Park Guell and the Sagrada Familia. Both of these sites are not close to the center and require a metro ride ---- the Melia Barcelona was much closer to these sites than a hotel in the center of the city would have been. Also, the neighborhood that the Melia is in is fantastic! It's a bit residential but there are amazing bakeries (check out Natcha across the street!), great restaurants and good shopping. I wish we had more time to explore this quaint neighborhood. I also liked being in this part of town, versus the center, because there are far less tourists. For us, we got a more authentic experience of Barcelona by staying here. The metro was about 10 minute walk and that's how we got around. As for the hotel itself, it was quite nice. A step up from a typical Marriott, but nothing over the top. Our room was on the 15th floor, clean, nice bathroom, quiet. No complaints. The front desk was very helpful in making restaurant recommendations --- we wanted authentic paella and there's a FABULOUS spot down the road, they got us a reservation at a very well known Barcelona seafood restaurant that was about a $5 cab ride. I would definitely stay here again and skip the Ramblas area completely and explore this charming neighborhood a bit more.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, far from center and metro.\u201d", "Author": "immerunterweg", "ReviewID": "UR119115337", "Content": "good for a business trip, and there's an all you can eat sushi belt restaurant down the street.

The staff were well presented, friendly and were knowledgable of the surronding area and gave us great tips about local area and what to visit. We didn't go to the restaurant in the hotel only because we wanted to experience authentic spainish food. But make sure you get the breakfast as it was very good, they had everything you could possibly think of and more. It was 17.50 euros each but as a general point try to book this with your flight as you will save lots. There are a number of great restaurants close by and mini supermarkets. There is a great italian a 10min walk called Gino's. There is also subway, starbucks and KFC all within a 8-10min walk! We didn't go there but it was satisfying to know it was close by. I would suggest walking around the hotel area as we found so many convienient little shops. The chemist is next door to the hotel which was really good. I would HIGHLY recommend going to a restarant called Tapa Tapa which is located near the magic fountain. You can catch the number 27 bus, (again close to the hotel) all the they way to the last stop which is about 10mins. Great food, service and great staff. It is open til 1am and 2am on Fridays. Super busy but you don't wait too long for a table! The bus tours stops were very close to the hotel, both the red and blue route were available to catch, we reccommend to buy a 2day pass as there is so much to see and it is easier than catching the metro or the bus. You can buy the bus tour tickets at the hotel as they offer a discount which was very handy. The FC football staduim was also very close by but we decided to walk as the weather was amazing and it took about 30mins. The local shopping destination was very close to the hotel, it reminded me of a mini Oxford Street. All the designer stores, department and favourties such as Zara, H&M, accesorize. On the last night we went to the spa and swimming pool. The pool was smaller than what is pictured but overall it was clean, calming and very modern. The steam and sauna room were nice as you would expect. Unfortunetly I was unable to get a massage as it was fully booked, so ladies make sure you book in advance!

For a \"city center\" location, it's very inconvenient. Far from the things you'll want to see, the places you'll want to eat, etc,, with poor Metro access, too. Despite this poor location, the hotel was also inconvenient for having a car. Basically, there's no place to park, without paying big bucks. The hotel garage is 27 euros a day with a guest discount -- and for that, you don't even get in-and-out privileges. The garage is also very tight with probably the most dangerous exit ramp I've ever seen. It was actually humorous to try to make one turn without hitting a wall (the hundreds of marks on the wall record the many who weren't careful enough). From 10 pm to 7 am, you can avoid this expense and danger by parking on the street for free (don't oversleep, they'll reportedly tow your car!), but that's obviously not very convenient. As others have noted, this hotel is extremely expensive (we stayed on a hotel loyalty program reward so it wasn't an issue). I don't see how it can deliver good value for money. The rooms are nice enough and well maintained, but the hotel is old and it shows. Beds are good, and we got both a \"waterfall\" shower and a tub. Hotel seemed to have good sound-proofing (or few guests) as we heard no outside noises. But at the end of the day, the room was really no more comfortable than at a hotel costing half the price, and I would strongly recommend trading a little bit of \"luxury\" for a better hotel location. By the way, the thing I'll probably remember most about the hotel is the elevators. They have no buttons to push -- you select your floor destination before you get on. I've never seen that before.

The location is in a nice area, within walking distance of some decent bars and restaurants. Not central, but for this hotel in Las Ramblas, you would double the price per night. It is located not that far from the central tourist areas- you can catch the bus, literally around the corner- which takes about 10 minutes to get to the centre. A taxi costs about 10 Euros. A taxi to the airport is about 25- 30 Euros. If the main reason for your trip is the FOOTBALL, then the location is perfect- 10 min walk to the NOU CAMP. The hotel lobby is modern, and the staff were friendly and helpful. We bought their \"LEVEL\" service which if you apply as a member- gets a 25% discount. This entitles you to Breakfast, access to a an all day buffet area with wine, juices, cakes, cold cuts, prawns, and cheese- really great idea- means you don\u00b4t have to get up for breakfast, or go out if you only want something light to eat. This buffet is replenished all day. The SPA is compact, but well equipped. Nice steam room, sauna, and jacuzzi thermal circuit- all working perfectly, unlike one reviewer remarked. The rooms are great. Modern, quality fittings, with a flat screen LCD screen. The BATHROOM is one of the best I\u00b4ve stayed in- quality ROCA fittings. Had a deep jacuzzi bath on the first night- superb. Has a really nice touch, of speakers from the main TV that can be switched on in the bathroom. SHOWER was powerful- but remember to slam the door sharply, as it was very easy to let water leak through. Beds were really comfortable. WI-fi excellent high speed in the room. Someone mentioned on here, that you had to keep getting a code- nonsense. As long as you log off, it is good for twelve hours of usage time- then you get a new code. Not a drama, just phone 4 and ask reception for a new code!!! Breakfast was impressive. Quality cold cuts, cheeses, pates, cakes, fruit, or you could have a cooked breakfast. Very, very nice. The staff were helpful and friendly throughout. I really don\u00b4t know why people have given it such bad reviews. People need to be fairer on Trip Advisor, otherwise the system fails.

Alexis Mazorra, the Guest Experience Manager, went above and beyond what he needed to do to make our stay a pleasant one .Because of Mr. Mazorra, we would not consider staying anywhere else in Barcelona on our next trip. The room was very nice with a very comfortable bed. Yes, the shower did leak a bit. The bathroom layout was so cool though that we didn't care!!! The multiple shower nozzles were also fun! We've stayed at many very nice hotels in Europe. I can tell you that the breakfast buffet at the Melia is as good as it gets. Absolutely wonderful!! There is certainly something for every taste.

Make sure to buy into their LEVEL service - for 35 eu extra you will enjoy a great breakfast, spa/pool entry, snack room throughout the day which serves variety of tapas, beers and hard liquors. Rooms are small but very clean, didn't really expect anything else from European hotels. Nice updated bathrooms with good showers, shower doors are a bit tricky, water may overflow but you will learn to work them rather quickly.

The staff was just above average. I didn't find them overly friendly but they were not rude either. I booked my hotel using Expedia and did not have any problems with check in. The first room I was assigned had not been cleaned yet so they had to assign me to a different room. The rooms are small but they were adequate. No coffee maker or iron and ironing board. The rooms had a tub (with jets) and separate shower. The shower only has a overhead spout. The spout on the wall could only be used for rinsing since it would not stay erect. The shower leaked water all over the floor everytime you used it. There was also mold around the shower (like it had been caulked to stop the leak). The sink was nice. The bathroom has no electrical outlets (for curling/flat ironing hair) luckily I travel with a extension cord which I had to run from the bedroom. They provide you no map of the city or how to get to to the metro, but I figured it out. The metro is not too far (Hospital Clinic stop). You have to go out the front of the hotel turn left (gas station turn right and about 3 blocks down. Not a very scenic route and be prepared for lots of graffiti. It is everywhere. The opposite direction will take you to AV Diagonal and that stretch has quite a few boutiques and a mall. I found the area surrounding the hotel quite loud I stayed on the 6th floor). Ambulances, sirens, and people beeping their horns at all hours of the night. Try to stay up higher if you choose to stay here. The hotel offers breakfast for 23 Euros per person and the spa is 15 Euro but they do offer a deal for 40 Euro per room for breakfast and the spa (which I had to ask about because I wasn't told but I did read about it in a Trip Advisor review). The hotel offers Free internet which was a plus, but I also had to ask for user ID and password after reading about it in the hotel guide. They offer 12 hours. The breakfast buffet is great!!

The room had extra pillows also. The bathroom was very large, and there was a door that separated the toilet area from the wash basin area. There was a steam shower and a Jacuzzi bathtub too, which surprised me. The room also had a small refrigerator, which was quite convenient. The curtains were blackout curtains, so I could control exactly how much light entered the room during the day and night. The temperature control beside the bed was digital, so we could control exactly what temperature we wanted. The storage space was adequate and the room was furnished with modern furniture with glass tops. The maid who made up our room was very efficient and friendly. The breakfast buffet was very nice and we found exactly what we usually have for breakfast at home. There were many fruits that were already peeled. The assortment of cold cuts was very good, and they had the very expensive pata negra ham, which is a delicacy in Spain. The staff at the restaurant were very attentive and eager to please, as well as being very friendly. We felt at home there. What I especially liked was the large variety of breakfast sweets, my favorite being the apple pastries, which were very fresh and juicy. The restaurant had some exquisite pastries, besides the apple pastries, which I believe were made by the French chef, also very friendly. I will definitely return to this hotel when I vacation again in Barcelona. It is a fabulous hotel and it really felt like home to me and my wife!

However, on the Easter Monday and just 200 metres from the Hotel Melia, on Avinguda Josep Tarradellas, my wallet was stolen with all my cash and credit cards. We were distracted by a guy on the street (using the \"bird poop on your jacket\" trick - we were just too tired too react) and it was only minutes later that I realized my wallet was gone. Hotel staff were sympathetic and gave us a complementary late check-out the next day (we had a late flight but were too afraid to leave the hotel with our money/passports). I feel however, that the Hotel Melia should do more to warn guests not to walk in this area especially when it is quiet. Later on the day we were robbed we had to go to the police station (5 minutes walk) but I didn't feel at all safe evening walking down there. So if you are coming or going from the Hotel Melia, please use a taxi.

As a previous review stated almost everyone except the maids spoke decent English. We spent a lot of evenings in the bar waiting for resturants to open for dinner and we were treated like family. It seemed like Delta crews use this hotel as well as other business people however because we were there over the holidays there were lots of families with young children. I don't think it is typically a family hotel but they were very good with our children even the 6 year old that kept breaking glasses in the bar. The concierge gave good resturant recommendations and even got us into a place for dinner on New Year's day when a lot of places were closed. Saved us wondering around the city looking at closed resturants. I did have a massage which was strickly OK. One complaint I have about the spa is that the massage rooms are right next to the weight room and the pool so I listened to kids playing in the pool and the sound of weights being clanged around during the massage. We ate at the hotel only on New Year's Eve and the food was suberb. They actually provided us with a kids dinner that was only about a quarter of the price of the adult meal. The internet was expensive - \u20ac12 per day. The location is about a \u20ac5 taxi ride to the Placa de Catalyuna and does have a good selection of resturants nearby.

When traveling for leisure I prefer a central location, which this hotel is not. For my particular trip this was fine. Las Ramblas area would have been noisy as several celebrations took place this week--Saint John\u2019s Day (fireworks and firecrackers throughout the night), Spain defeated Russia in a soccer playoff for the Euro 2008. Going on to win the championship for the first time in over 40 years! The front desk staff were fluent in English. To use the elevators, push the number(s) for your floor. The response will be what elevator car to use. If several floors are for the same car, the floor numbers will light inside the doorway. Press 0 to return to the lobby. From the hotel to the top of Las Ramblas a taxi cost 7EUR; airport 25EUR; cruise terminal (\u201cpuerto agua\u201d was the best translation that got me there) 17EUR. I did not dine in the hotel but instead opted to stock the minibar fridge with my own juice, yogurt, and fruit purchased in the basement at El Corte Ingles. ECI is several blocks away. A few blocks further was a 24 hour Internet / shipping store. One hour of Internet time cost 5EUR. There may be some places closer to the hotel but I needed a one place shop since my checked luggage didn\u2019t arrive with me. The superior room was pleasant with a king size bed and a very high thread count bedding. The mattress was firm (not hard) and pillows soft. The amenities had a masculine fragrance for my taste. There is a separate shower and whirlpool tub. A packet and map costs 3EUR per person for the Bus Turistic www.tmb.net, then pay 17EUR on board for the tour. Either way the tour is 20EUR pp, so why not give a small commission to the hotel? I had only a short amount of leisure time and was the best way to get in a lot of sights. The pick up point for either the blue (southern) or red route (northern) is an easy 10 minute walk. TIPS: Theft alert\u2013I personally heard from 4 different passengers on cruise ships who were victims of pickpocketing. Even a local had her purse stolen off her shoulder from a passing motorbike. Wear a money belt with your passport, credit cards, and large amounts of cash inside. Anything else should be an amount you are willing to part with or have the credit card number written somewhere so you can report it missing. Never bring your money belt out in public, you can always go to a bathroom at McDonald\u2019s to retrieve its contents. Ladies should keep purses on their laps, never on the back of a chair or on the floor. Cruise port to town\u2013A taxi will cost 7EUR to town (Las Ramblas). A public bus round trip is 3EUR, but get there early or resign to sharing a taxi. The walk to town is probably over two miles. Bus Turistic\u2013Pick up the red route near the hotel. The line went on forever when we tried to connect from the blue to the red route at Placa de Catalunya. All in all, I loved Barcelona. A long stay in the city would be desirable as Barcelona has so much to offer. It is easy to get around and a very walkable location.

Of course, I have a few comments of my own to add! CAB FARE to hotel (from BCN airport): \u20ac 35 (supplement, etc). We arrived at 11:45 am on a weekday. We each had 2 pieces of luggage (1 large, 1 carry-on). If we had less luggage, I would have liked to save \u20ac by taking the bus to the city centre, then grabbing a cab from there. Seems that other people did that. Oh, and the day we arrived, looked like possible rain. Okay, we HAD TO suck it up and pay extra. Aren\u2019t we on vacation, after all?? LOCATION: pretty good. Someone mentioned a bus stop near the hotel? We never took a bus. We always walked 5 minutes (about 6-8 blocks) to the nearest metro (Hospital Clinic, Blue line #5). Plenty of great places (cafes, shops, etc) to eat in (if you can stomach all the cigarette smoking) or to take out (\u201cpara llevar\u201d), as we did once with a bottle of wine. We enjoyed a nice little picnic in our room! STAFF: Everyone at the front desk spoke English. And was the perfect blend of consummate professional and friendliness. Particular kudos to Ignacio (aka Nacho \u2013 he is a thin bald man who looked like the actor who played the owner of Melville\u2019s Bar on the 90\u2019s tv show \u201cCheers\u201d), Daniel (tall dude with funky glasses), and Josef (bellhop). The Piano Bar\u2019s bartender (we never go this name) is also very sweet and he always remembered what we had ordered the night before! ELEVATOR: There were four. I have no idea what an earlier reviewer was talking about. (Maybe she didn\u2019t have a bellhop explain it to her?) Trust me \u2013 have the bellhop \u201cassist\u201d you with your bags, even if you can bring it up yourself. It is worth it. He will explain the elevators to you and show you all the many features of your room. The main level where you come in is \u201c0\u201d floor (ground level), and the restaurants are on the sub-level (-1). Maybe that reviewer did not read/see the signs on each floor written in three languages explaining how to use the elevator? To her credit, maybe the elevator sign was NOT THERE during her visit. TELEVISION: Unless you speak Spanish or German (like Madrid, is there a large German population??), you are going to hate the tv here. Only CNN, BCC and DW-TV (sometimes in English, sometimes in German). Bring a dvd player or laptop and upload (or bring) a few movies to watch if you spend any time in your room. ADAPTER PLUGS: We had our own, but I think the hotel will provide them should you need any. According to my email to them the week before, the hotel supposedly has them. We never asked so I cannot confirm this. INTERNET: There is no area to get free wiFi internet service here. (We were crushed!) But, the hotel\u2019s internet service was a little expensive (\u20ac 8 for 24 hours). You may be better off going to any of the internet cafes throughout the city. Many of them serve food (or coffee, at the very least) so you can kind of kill two birds with one stone there. We ate the cost, so we could get the convenience of doing internet service within our room. Bear in mind you will have a deposit \u201ccost\u201d of \u20ac 10 for the cable line, that is refunded ONLY WHEN you return the cable to the front desk. We had a problem with our internet cable\u2026 first the internet worked, then when we returned from a few hours of sight seeing, it stopped working. Heriberto (the technician) spoke virtually no English, but was nice and with my broken Spanish, we figured out our cable was \u201cbad\u201d. He was particularly kind and very helpful. GYM/ATHLETIC FACILITY: Located on floor \u201c1\u201d. You can also walk up a small flight of stairs on the ground floor (to the right of the elevators). Using the athletic facility is free. We never did. Not sure whether there was a charge/fee to use the Jacuzzi. The water seemed to be one degree above lukewarm, at best. Hmmm, pretty happy I did not bring a swimsuit in order to verify the temperature! BREAKFAST: SPECTACULAR. I greatly enjoyed my Madrid breakfast (see my review). But this hotel blows that away. Pretty hard! There\u2019s a hot bar, including a ton of sausages, a saut\u00e9ed wild mushroom, baked beans, paella (odd, but who cares?!!), and\u2026 an omelette station (I am not kidding). A middle island \u201csalad\u201d bar consisted of: various platters of cut fruit (including this really tasty fruit indigenous to Colombia called pintilla, looks like citrus with black seeds), whole fruit (apples, oranges, etc), champagne (theirs is called cava), 2-3 types of fruit juices, 2 types of water (gas/regular), ice, cereals (we didn\u2019t have any), coffee/tea, olives, hot peppers, corn, chopped tomatoes, smoked salmon, sushi (sometimes), various local cheeses, salami, chorizo, ham, and a few other things. Oh, it\u2019s not that I couldn\u2019t ask, but my dictionary was so bad that when they answered, I\u2019d METRO (subway system): Very easy to use. Pretty safe. If you are there for 3 days or more, highly recommend the 10-trip bonos (bonus) for \u20ac 6,90. Unlike Madrid, here two people CAN SHARE the same card!! Generally, you will never have to wait more than 3-4 minutes for the next subway. The subway trains are generally quick. Sometimes, you will need to do a lot of walking within the subway system just to transfer, so if you have difficulties walking up stairs, you need to know this. Generally, the escalators go in the upward direction, but you need to be able to walk down stairs. Few restaurants worth mentioning (alphabetical order)- ANTIAQUINO \u2013 this is an upscale place. CERVECERIA CATALUNA \u2013 OMG\u2026 a local place, about a 20 minute walk from the hotel, near the Diagonal section of town (corner of Rbla. Catalunya and Mallorca). LA BOTIGA \u2013 trendy-looking but decent prices and portions! It\u2019s very close to the hotel (Av. Josef Tarradelles, near the Starbucks) The detailed reviews are in the Tip Section that follows! GENERAL TIP on RESTAURANTS: bread & butter is additional in Europe. I know, I know, but that\u2019s what it is. If you don\u2019t want the additional charge, you must SAY SO when you order (\u201cno pan\u201d or \u201csin pan\u201d will suffice), or REFUSE IT if they bring it to your table before you even order. Also, they push ordering the bottles water in Barcelona BIG TIME. The locals tell me NOBODY there drinks the tap water. In fact, many restaurants will flat out REFUSE to serve tap water to you. On Day 2, I finally stopped trying and gave in but I would order the smallest bottled water (sin gas \u2013 no bubbles!) possible. WINES: Generally, practically anything local (made in Spain/Barcelona/Catalunya) is really decent in restaurants. If you dine at a local place, you can get a nice bottle of wine for \u20ac 6-7. No joke! Often, if you cannot drink the entire bottle, if you only want a glass or small bottle (half-size? Similar to a large bottle of beer in size), the prices are also not bad. We\u2019ve had a glass of house wine for \u20ac1,80 and I\u2019ve seen a small bottle (mini-bottle, if you will) for \u20ac3,50 - \u20ac4. BEFORE YOU GO: Helpful to bring a small Spanish dictionary or any of the gamut of little books put out by any of the travel or language people. This is ESPECIALLY important if, like us, you enjoy going off the beaten path. Most people in the working world do not speak very much English other than \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d or \u201cSorry\u201d. I am not making any statements or putting any culture down; it is based on my own travel observation & experience. It was very humbling to conjure up my high school Spanish irregular verbs\u2026 but I think the majority of people seem appreciative if you genuinely try! Also, call up your credit card companies. Two reasons for this: first, you will find out what the fee is per transaction (yes, it was a surprise to me but using your charge card outside the US, the credit card companies tack on an additional fee to the purchase price!). VISA/MC is usually 1%, whereas AmEx is 2%. But you will want to confirm with them. Secondly, you want to tell them that you will be in Spain/Europe. The last thing you want to do is to be in a posh store and your credit card company thinks you aren\u2019t you (fraud alert), and you have to provide the store additional identification [we almost never took our passports with us (we were mugged in Rome 3 years ago \u2013 learned our mistake then! Lovely US Embassy in Rome!!), except on travel days]. Spare yourself the hassle. BEST ADVICE I LEARNED BY ACCIDENT: Chat up your bellhop. Overtip him by about half of \u20ac1 (or \u20ac 0,50). Trust me, it was worth it. Every time we saw him (Josef) he was very chatty and always had advice for us! Also, if your hotel is part of a chain (like this), you can email them in advance of any questions/concerns you may have. They will respond well within 24 hours! REGRETS: On our (day) trip to Montserret, we ran into wonderful American who used the guidebooks (Rick Steve). I had seen many many people in Spain (both Madrid and Barcelona) use this series.

After the bus ride from the airport to 'Plac des Catalunya' we got a taxi to the hotel (cost about \u20ac6). On arrival, reception staff were efficient and courteous, speaking excellent english. We were offered an upgrade to executive status for \u20ac40 per night for both of us. This we found to be well worthwhile as it got us access to 'The Level' on the first floor. In here was free drinks and snacks from 10am until 11pm. There was an excellent selection of meats, cheeses, nuts, canapies and donuts along with wine, beer and soft drinks. Executive status also got us free access into the spa and pool which normally incurs a charge, even for guests. People have mentioned the lifts being a problem. I disagree, I think the lifts are great as you get one all to yourself and it goes straight to your floor. In the lobby, you key your floor number into the control panel and a screen tells you which of the 4 lifts are for you. When it arrives it goes straight to your floor without stopping...great! The rooms are very modern with large plasma TV, jacuzzi bath and full body shower. Only one english language TV channel (BBC news 24) though which seems to be the case all over Spain! We were on a bed & breakfast basis but decided to eat in the hotel restaurant on our first night. This turned out to be a bad idea though as the food was bland and pretty much tasteless. My steak was dripping blood even though I asked for medium to well done. We were not charged for my girlfriends meal as she could'nt eat it, it was so bland. The waiter was very apologetic and could not be more friendly and helpful. He genuinely seemed worried that our meal was not to our taste. Breakfast was a huge buffet of hot and cold food, juices and breads, staff were all helpful and friendly. The spa was very small but very clean and well presented. We had it all to ourselves and had a lovely swim, jacuzzi and a sauna. Gown and slippers are supplied along with warm towels. 'The Level' was great, we spent hours in there, getting our moneys worth of free beer, wine & food, whilst using the free internet to catch up with things back home. All in, we found the hotel to be clean & modern and all the staff were helpful and friendly. Although its a bit far from the centre of things, theres a bus stop round the corner, with a frequent, fast service that takes you in for \u20ac1.25 or the taxis are \u20ac6.

The hotel staff was friendly, helpful and very professional in all of our dealings with them. They helped us arrange tours and told us about things to see and where to eat in the area. The breakfast buffet was excellent and had choices that would be acceptable to anyone with any type of need or restriction. Despite other reviews on this page I like the elevator and we had no problem with the operation, speed or any other aspect of the elevator system. The only drawback to the hotel was that it is not in the center of the \"action areas\" although there is easy access to these areas via public transportation and/or cabs. We felt very safe walking through the area at night. The hotel was a 20 euro cab ride from the airport and 25 euros to the port area where we met our cruise ship.

The elevator!!!!!! This, otherwise, above average hotel was completely ruined for me simply because of a crazy elevator system!!!! The hotel, a modern, sleek high-rise with very friendly staff and over-sized accommodations was seemingly perfect for my one night of business travel but I could never recommend this place to anyone I like... the elevator experience was crazy! First of all, I was on a high floor so, having no athletic ability, I had no other choice but to wait for the elevator. If you weren't advised how these elevators worked, you'd be sitting staring at the door for 15 minutes before it finally opened. Even when you knew how it worked, you still had to wait forever!!! So maybe the over-dramatization had more to do with my stressful work schedule and the elevator just so happened to make me late for an early morning meeting (with luggage in hand, no way was I taking the stairs)... but whatever... I left the hotel, shaking fist in the air... I will never return here again!!! FYI... Great bathrooms. Whirl pool tub was fantastic for a relaxing bubble bath! . . . and a cool flat screen TV which made my husband jealous, which was kind of fun.", "Date": "May 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silver Spring, MD", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience at Melia!!\u201d", "Author": "ChocNomad74", "ReviewID": "UR6475778", "Content": "(from Washington DC) We loved Melia Barcelona!

This probably explains why some of the comments here say it needs to be renovated. We had a recently updated room and it was incredibly nice. We had a king size bed, a flat panel plasma TV, and a bathroom with a bathtub with jacuzzi jets and a shower stall that had whole-body massage and powerful jets. The hotel staff was all very helpful, the bar was very nice and the drinks very good, and the meeting facilities top notch. They had a wonderful gym (the pool is not included with the room; it's part of the spa that costs extra but it isn't a workout pool anyway). As for location, this hotel is not in the middle of \"tourist\" Barcelona, meaning areas such as Las Ramblas (which is horribly overrated anyway). It is, however, near alot of good restaurants and very close to the large pedestrian walkway of Rambla de Catalunya. It's right on Av Diagonal, which is the shopping captial street of Barcelona. Barcelona has a top-notch metro system that can take you anywhere you want to go in the city (although the stop is about a 8 minute walk from the hotel) so seeing the sites is not hard. In conclusion, this place is wonderful. The rooms are fantastic. Assuming you don't mind walking and riding the metro to seeing the \"sights,\" you're love the location.

I asked for a converter to use curling iron and had a lot of trouble getting one. I finally did get it. This is definitely not a 5 star hotel. I asked about a swimming pool, was told they had one but it cost $16 euros to use it. It was obviously part of a gym but they didnt convey that. We were not close to anything.
