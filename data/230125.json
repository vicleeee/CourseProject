The building is a historic building, which also means it is a bit dated. They have two distinct styles of rooms, the regular and the urban. I prefer the urban rooms with their modern, decor, red accents, dark furniture and fresh feel, despite the smaller space. By contrast, the regular rooms are larger, with dated furniture, creaking floor boards and a more traditional look. Service at the hotel is average, probably because they are always busy. So if you are looking for personal attention, this place is not for you. A big plus staying at this hotel is the free high speed wifi. For some reason, you have to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd high speed internet from your room and then they take it off your bill at checkout. I find this to be odd and bothersome. During one of my stays here, they forgot to take off the internet from the bill, and I had to call to get it adjusted. There is a nice swimming pool that guests can use, but access to sauna or fitness center costs extra. Finally, room service is rather expensive. But this is the case in most hotels in Amsterdam. I ordered a meal that cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac23 at retail price, but they added room charge of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.50 and another \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.00 in service fee.

Last year stayed in the older part and, like an earlier review, the corridor smelt disgusting but we went back again this year, really because of the excellent location of the hotel. Stayed in the urban wing this time which is very pleasant and modern. The room (757) was very cold, even though the radiator was on, and there isn't any heating in the bathroom so that was even colder. The curtains are long and thick and covered the radiator when drawn. Told reception, after the first night, how cold the room was and was told they would give us a heater. No heater arrived but we drew the curtains and had to screw them up behind and over the radiator so we could get some heat from it. Problem then was it was noisy as you could hear the water running through the radiator. Told reception and concierge again, the second morning, and again promised a heater and again one didn't arrive. Left the next day so obviously didn't pursue it further. The maid wasn't very good either, she never replaced the empty tissue box just left it wide open in the bathroom, she took my own soap, well it disappeared, she took the used hotel flannels and didn't replace them with clean ones and she never dusted the bedside tables. Needless to say she didn't get a tip!! Other than that it was fine. The staff are very friendly and helpful, except for trying to get a heater and the concierges are great for guidance, directions etc. The location is brilliant, near the station, shops, bars and restaurants.

It is very hard to beat the location - right on the corner of Prins Hendrikkade & The Damrak, and right across from the historic Centraal Station (train), the hotel is right by several canal tour options, about a ten minute walk from Dam Square (Madame Tussauds) in one direction, and about the same to Ann Frank's House, located on Prinsengracht (near Westermarkt). It is less than ten minutes walk to Amsterdam's red light district. On my first trip, the room was quite nice, but on the second trip, I got an upgrade to the suite, as I had to book on short notice after missing a flight to Berlin and being holed up in Amsterdam for a day. That was great - I had a living room, then climbed some stairs to the bedroom, which was right at the top of the building with probably the best view of the canal & Amsterdam Centraal that money can buy. The hotel is old and has very beautiful decor. I had a breakfast of scrambled egg & toast, which was on-order rather than a buffet. It's a very handy hotel if you are looking to use the train to go to either Schipol Airport, or heading out of town (either in Holland, Belgium or France). It takes about 20 minutes from the platform at Centraal Station to get to Schipol Airport, which is quite a way from Amsterdam. It is also great that you exit the hotel and are right on The Damrak, which seems to be the main thoroughfare for foot traffic & shoppers in Amsterdam. There are a string of reasonably good restaurants along The Damrak, and if you head in the direction of the Nieuwmarkt, you will almost certainly pass through part of the red light district, which is a real eye-opener, especially at night. While there are other hotels in the immediate vicinity, I just think this one is a lovely old hotel that is the best in terms of the location/quality ratio.

What's not so good? 1) Wrong room assignment After booking via booking.com I contacted the hotel direct to request an upgrade to the Urban Suite etc which was confirmed by email. Upon arrival - we were assigned one room - and told to come back in two hours to be given the key cards. I told them they were assigning the wrong room as I had upgraded to an Urban junior suite - They refused this - and told me I had originally booked a twin room and they had kindly upgraded it to a king double (twin beds to a king bed is an upgrade??). Upon returning after the 2 hours wait...we were assigned another room...despite my protests we were taken to the Victoria wing - and taken to an awful room! I immediately phoned reception & insisted there had been a mistake. Such a bad first impression of a hotel. 2) No early check in option We arrived at 10am - and had to wait for the full 2 hours to get to a room. 3) We were assigned 3 rooms in total (before we could settle in), 1 room upon arrival (which we never saw), another when we went back to collect the keys - and another when I complained it wasn't the room I had upgraded to and already paid for. The reception staff were reluctant to move us and I had to prove from a printed email - that I had a confirmed upgrade. It made me feel awful - as it was a birthday trip - and none of the careful pre arrangements had been carried out (e.g. birthday card, VIP treatment). 3) Reception staff were decidedly unfriendly & disbelieving to the point where we avoided the reception totally. 4) Hotel cards to door didnt work on several occasions - where we had been accidentally checked out several times (by the system??) before our booking was over (meaning the room hadn't been cleaned either). 5) Cleaning staff say 'House keeping...' and enter your room anyway (even if you call out to say you are there) ...we were caught in bed on several occasions (early in the morning)...felt our privacy was invaded and we were always listening for the door to open! 6) We were overcharged (on our credit card) and had already paid for the room via the hotel booking group before we arrived but were told we hadnt been charged and had to a room deposit - then had to pay again on departure - at a completely different rate.

There is a sign in the lobby toilet asking for 50c from non guests so clearly they are allowed to use it, they just pay for the privilege. (We saw several other hotels advising outsiders that the loos were for the use of the hotel guests only so it's not uncommon). One night a man followed us into the lobby and asked us for cannabis and the staff surrounded him and ushered him out very quickly which was reassuring. The lobby staff went to great lengths to offer advice on tours trips etc. However we did buy canal boat tickets in the hotel at what was claimed to be a discounted rate, and one couple in our party found it \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.5 cheaper per person to turn up at the dock but the staff member in question was so nice we didn't begrudge him a couple of euros commission! The hotel is in two halves, classic and urban. We were given a classic room (which was quite large clean etc) but we upgraded to a suite on the urban side which was more modern and stylish. Separate sitting room, extra tv, expresso coffee maker and 7 foot bed with memory foam matress topper, lovely! There was a bottle of water which we presumed to be complimentary which we drank, and it appeared on the mini bar bill at the end of the stay at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.50 so watch out for that! The hotel is perfectly situated as most other reviewers have already mentioned. We took a train from Schipol Airport (3 stops) and exiting the station, the hotel is directly opposite and only about 2 minute suit-case drag!

I have stayed a few times with The Victoria and the time before last was awful. The dreaded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One foot around a single bed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd box room. It was a show stopper...I was never going to stay there again after that. My colleague uses TripAdvisor and had entered a review of our stay and had commented on my tiny room. To my utter surprise a couple of weeks, maybe ten days, after the event he informed me that he had received an email from Trip Advisor asking if The Victoria could contact him. They did so forthwith. It was a direct response to his review on Tripadvisor from the Hotel manager. I hadn't heard of such a thing. The lady was very apologetic and offered to upgrade us to an Urban Suite should we choose to stay with The Victoria again. We are through Amsterdam all year round on business so we took them up the offer and even the booking was personally taken care of. We arrived very early in the morning flying in from Africa. This was not a problem for the Hotel, although the rooms were not ready, as expected, they were happy to store our bags as we headed off for an important meeting. The Suite itself was fairly impressive as a Suite and for Amsterdam Central it was very very good. Massive and hugely comfortable bed, big flat screens, bright white bathroom finished well and a separate office/sitting area. All pretty new by the looks of things. Bathrobe provided which should be standard in my opinion. If I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have had a free upgrade I would be complaining about the fact that Housekeeping left a big dirty scrubbing sponge on top of my jumper which was on a chair, so room for improvement. The Staff was pleasant as always, check in staff particularly nice. Location wise, if you want to be by Centraal Station then you simply can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do better. The Victoria clearly cares about its guests and their opinions, a quick read of this and the fact that every review is responded to proves that. It is most certainly not the case with the majority of hotels. They went above and beyond for us and if I am staying in the area again then I will stay there again. Location is key in Amsterdam and The Victoria is very convenient. The rooms can be mixed but the Urban Suites are pretty sweet. Most of all though, they clearly care and they clearly try very hard to keep their guests happy. I am most certainly one of them. Let us not forget that as customers who have places such as Tripadvisor to post genuine reviews should use it as it should be used. If a hotel cares then they will use Tripadvisor as the very powerful tool that it is. The Victoria clearly gets this. Other Hotels should also. Don't expect to get an upgrade if something is wrong though...this was exceptional, and the fact that we are regular customers has to be considered in also.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, nice service and room\u201d", "Author": "keenscarlet", "ReviewID": "UR121928787", "Content": "stayed here for a weekend away, got an early check-in, great tips from the concierge and a clean comfortable room.

Take extreme care crossing the street. The cyclists don't take prisoners! The main bar, near Reception, was only open from 17:00 to 01:00 during our stay. The other bar, next door to the Brasserie, was open intermittently but you can order a drink in the Brasserie itself. My experience of the hotel was that the bar, concierge and Brasserie staff were truly excellent. Housekeeping left a lot to be desired though. In the evening the Brasserie is set up for two different types of service. The tables in the area by the windows are set out with linen tablecloths, silverware and an array of glasses. If you sit here they give you the dinner menu - not extensive but the dishes we had were very good. In the darker section of the Brasserie the seating is more casual as is the menu. This is the place to have breakfast. On the first morning for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12.50 I had a platter with six slices of yellow cheese, a wedge of brie, two slices of ham, two slices of chicken breast and one slice of roast beef with a hard-boiled egg, a fruit yogurt, a basket of bread and croissants, orange juice (it tasted freshly squeezed) and the coffee of my choice Much better value than the buffet breakfast in the other restaurant - this I understand was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac23. I ate breakfast in the Brasserie every day and although the items on the platter varied it was always excellent value for money - enough for two people unless you are very hungry. The hotel has two sections - turn right when you enter for the Urban wing and left for the Victoria wing. The former has been newly refurbished with red and black funky decor. The latter is well past its best with brown/beige rather grubby, and in some places smelly, carpets. Our room (number 231) was quirky. You'd either love it or hate it. It was on two levels. The lower level included the bathroom and a large, but not very comfortably furnished, sitting room with the most appalling lighting I've ever experienced in a hotel. We asked one of the staff who delivered room service to send us up another lamp of some kind as we couldn't see to prepare paperwork for our conference. The lamp never materialised. We had to have the TV switched on to provide additional lighting. The room is built into the eves of one of the bits of the hotel that extend outwards from the main block. To get to the bedroom we had to climb a really steep staircase - more like a ladder really. There was no light over the staircase. I suspect this would fail a health and safety inspection in the UK. We had to position the standard lamp to illuminate the bottom of the stairs and leave it on all night in case we needed to come down to the bathroom in the dark. This meant we had light spillage upwards into the bedroom loft space. The bed was two metres wide which was very nice but there was so little space around it you had to walk sideways to get into bed whilst trying not to bump your head on the beams. There was a strange wheel with sharp spikes in the roof space over the sitting room. Lots of beams - you'd have thought they could have fixed a light to one of them. The only lighting downstairs was the ceiling lamp in the entrance hallway, a small desk lamp and the standard lamp in the corner of the room. No light over the sofa or coffee table or in the wardrobe. The sofa was hard and not at all comfortable. When we arrived (late at night) the room was freezing. In the dark we didn't notice the low radiator under the bottom of the curtains so tried to generate heat with what turned out to be the airconditioning controls. Turning it up to 23.5 C made no difference whatsoever. Of course, we found the radiator in the morning when we opened all the curtains. You'd have thought housekeeping could have left the radiators on setting 2 or 3 rather than the snowflake setting when they made up the room. On which subject, in a six day stay our room was serviced only once without prompting. We tried taking the do-not-distrub sign off the door when we left our room around nine - the room wasn't serviced. The next day we turned the sign around to the please-clean-my-room side - the room wasn't serviced. I had been reluctant to use this sign as it was the same colour on both sides and I feared the housekeeping staff would at a quick glance think we were displaying the do-not-disturb sign. I had to ring housekeeping at around 15:00 each day to get them to service the room after we'd been out all day since around nine. I asked for an extra duvet the first morning because we had been too cold to sleep the first night. They failed to provide one. I used one of the pillows as a cushion on the chair downstairs expecting they would provide another pillow upstairs but no such luck. I might stay here again but only in the Urban wing and I'd go straight to the general manager over any housekeeping issues next time.

Only execption... the bathroom which was a far way too little for superiour class room, but really cannot say if it is per room beacause my friend have single room and he have bathroom over 3 size than me and a bathtub in it. The hotel is very centrally located, right across Amsterdam Central. There are many good restaurants and souvenir shops next to the hotel and of course, this place is near everything, like Trainstation, shopping street etc. The location of this Hotel is as good you can get if you look the Hotel in Central part of Amsterdam. The fitness center and sauna is run by a third party and is not included in the room charge. 14.50 Euros/day is far too expensive. And it only runs from 10am-10pm. Like \"complimentary\" water, which you can buy from room for 6,50\u00e2\u201a\u00ac!. Well, it surely is ok to charge from water but, when you pay over 200\u00e2\u201a\u00ac from room i think you really should get some for free too. Internet connection (even after upgrading to business) is a littlebit slow but works guite well. Breakfast ends at 10am but there are options around the hotel if you need to eat breakfast later. Breakfast was wery nice and have a lot of different options and juices etc. Room cleaning was very good, like the service also. Fast and helpful.

At first, the view was great. I could watch the comings and goings of Amsterdam's finest out of my 1st floor window. Then I noticed the sound from the road crossing beacons. Tick tick tick it counted down from 50 nice and slowly. Then the little green man came on and tocktocktock at one hundred miles an hour.

So I though that I would choose a hotel next to the station for convenience. Well the hotel is very conveniently located for the station so no need for a taxi etc.and all trips start and end there. However with the current subway building works the station forecourt is not very pleasant. I must say that during our stay there was no noise or dirt form the building works, but the area is a bit of a mess with hoardings around a big hole in the ground. We stayed for a week on holiday. The atmosphere is very 'lively' and busy with many people rushing around either for work or play. This was too lively for a relaxing holiday. I think that for a weekend it would be ideal as the general hubbub and mess of the area didn't wear me down until about day 3. The buffet breakfast was excellent but very expensive if not included in the deal. We paid 23\u00e2\u201a\u00ac. In the end we usually had coffee and a la carte breakfast in the public cafe, or there are other cafes nearby. (We tried the next door McDonalds, which as a rule is OK for breakfast, but must say the Damrak branch is not very salubrious) Immediately before we left I read reviews that said that the hotel was infested with rodents - I am happy to report that we did NOTencounter a single one. An Italialian restaurant in Damrak has a resident cat which wandered amongst the diners. In normal circumstances I might find this offputting, but in this case found it re-assuring. Re the room - it was fine. It was relatively spacious for a city centre hotel with plenty of storage space. The decor was a bit brown, but it was fine. The room was quiet and we slept well. The room servicing was interesting - we felt that the chambermaid was playing mind-games with us. On putting used towel in the bath to indicate replace it, the old one was taken away but not replaced. it got that we were scared to repeat that experience in case we ended up with no towels, so hung our used towels up to dry. Admitttedly we did get a fresh set eventually. At the start of the stay the range of toiletries was one of best I have ever seen in a hotel - including emergency toothbrushes and shavers etc. all there without having to ask. However the replacement of the said toiletries was not good. A perfectly good soap bar, used on one occasion was removed on day 2 and not replaced, ever. We switched to bath gel while it lasted, but on the final day I washed with shampoo. Despite leaving hints about the black tea situation - replacement of tea and creamer was a bit hit-and miss as well. In summary - the main reason that I wouldn't stay in this hotel again is that the location is a bit TOO lively/messy for me, and I next time I would choose somewhere a little more laid-back/neat and tidy. However the location would be absolutely ideal for someone staying for a weekend break as it is so centrally located and handy for the station.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, nice rooms\u201d", "Author": "ChrisUKinHanoi", "ReviewID": "UR120222911", "Content": "I was only in Amsterdam overnight in advance of a flight in the morning, but decided to stay in the centre rather than out at Schiphol.

In addition, the surrounding area and streets are a nice setting to walk around and have a quick look into what Amsterdam is like. The hotel rooms have clearly been updated recently, with a very nice and modern feel to the rooms. They are much better than most hotel rooms in major cities in Europe these days (although European hotels have a habit of being too tired it seems). So for rooms, this is a great choice. The service here is not bad, although they need to sort out their check-out process as it takes far longer than it should. I saw on their interactive TVs that they had an e-checkout option but unfortunately that didn't seem to be working. The only other criticism is that the lift system is a bit annoying as you have to chance lifts to get to different rooms. That is a minor inconvenience I guess.

None of us enjoyed our stay. We travel a lot on business purpose and are very used to 4 and 5 stars hotels. This one is at the very most a 3 stars one. Hotel common areas : When arriving with your heavy suitcase you have to climb some stairs to reach the \"welcome\" desk. I didn't see any groom around to provide some help with luggage. The corridors are old, gloomy. During our stay only one elevator was working, you consequently had to wait for ages to get one (almost when a huge tourist group is around) . The bar is at the same time expensive with a cold ambiance and freezing because of the A/C. The service is quite long when you request for some tapas even if the bar is almost deserted. Positive point : The hotel is central located and the concierge is a real, pure jewel more than proficient. The restaurant : Food was correct, not more, even if I had to experience the most strange fish soup I ever had. The service was so long that we thought that they went to hunt the cow before serving it. And the restaurant was very far from being busy.... The breakfast, globally looks cheap, you can find several kinds of sandwich loaf but no real French bread. You cannot find a yogurt (replaced by some strange tasting curd cheese). Only 2 sorts of jam ... But at the same time we are in the Netherlands ... which are not really famous for their food. (even if you can find some very good restaurants in the city). Rooms :When I check in I was given a tiny room in the \"historical wing\" of the hotel.My room was looking over a \"patio\" consisting in 3 ugly sad walls very close to the windows. I requested to move but the \"welcome\" desk told me that there was not any available room better than mine (on a Sunday afternoon at 03:00pm). One of my colleagues who met the same matter (with a view on the same \"patio\" and it's \"terrace\" used as beer cases storage, was given as a replacement a tiny tiny room with a tiny single bed though I booked some queen size rooms for each of us. Rooms do not come with ironing board, you have to request for it to be delivered. The air conditioning system is locked, you cannot regulate it and of course it's very cold. The only solution is to keep it off. Positive points :The rooms are equipped with Wifi and beds are comfortable. Bathroom : No bathrobe, no slippers and the bath towels are too small to cosily wrap yourself in them. The sink stank of sewage, which was very unpleasant when you entered the room or when you had to face it when awakening. In fact I got 2 options : stay in the stench with AC off ... or ... freeze . The gym :UNBELIEVABLE !!!!!!!!!!!! You have to pay 12 euros to access the \"gym\" which consists in very poor equipments dispatched over 30 squared meters at the most. Explanation : The gym is not run by the hotel !!!!!!!!!!! The swimming pool is more the size of a paddling pool. I got a chance to have a look at the \"modern wing\" where all rooms have been refurnished. Rooms seems bigger, clean with modern convenience but there is something cold and sad emanating. Rate : 142 euros on B&B basis , but that's a corporate negotiated rate. Each of us thought it wasn't worth it. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody.

At that moment I began to doubt the hotel was truly a 4* hotel, given the price that I'd just paid in advance for the hotel it was quite disheartening - keeping in mind that this was the most I've ever paid for a hotel that didn't include even breakfast. Me and my partner just exchanged glances - but we both wondered what type of hotel it was and whether we'd been \"ripped off\". I didn't find the check-in experience particularly impressive, didn't get anything mentioned about the loyalty scheme or even breakfast. It could have possibly been the noise coming from the bar, but not particularly an excuse. We had a room that was on the first floor, I was rather worried about noise so asked upon arrival but was told that there were no other rooms available. Thankfully it was relatively quiet, however it was one of the darkest most depressing rooms I've been in even with all the lights on. The bed was not great and the interior furnishings and carpet in the room looked quite old and due for renewal. Bathroom was in a similar condition. The heating and the airconditioning had both been left on. I've been in budget hotels that were better. The teas and coffees in the room had not been stocked up on our arrival and even after the room had been cleaned the following morning, we didn't get any replenishment - so we had to telephone housekeeping. To be fair to them, they were very quick to remedy this issue. However, I've again been in budget hotels where this hasn't happened. Another point of the room was the fact that there was an extortionately priced bottle of water in the room, I've stayed in many hotels across the world and it's rare that water is a chargeable item and is usually provided complimentary. Especially true of 4* hotels. Also we found that there was only one extra pillow in the wardrobe, which had no pillow case upon it. Again we telephoned for housekeeping and they speedily remedied the problem bring two pillows. Again I'm thinking of a few popular budget hotel chains that this hasn't happened in too. I found it disappointing that after bringing my shorts and gym clothes from the UK that the gym in the hotel was an extra charge too. Aside from the cosmetics and the general decor of the room that obviously need updating. There is obviously an issue with consistency and there should be at the very least check-sheets for the cleaning staff upon both regular cleaning and changeover before the room is marked as complete or ready for the next tenant. Upon leaving the hotel which was around 12 noon on the Monday, there was a large queue at reception - given that 12 is check-out time, I would expect more staff than the single member to be on duty. The process was slow, the member of staff was obviously overwhelmed and there was a queue that included ourselves who were all understandably irritated, especially as there were a large number of concierge staff not doing anything other than talking! We were waiting to be asked how our stay was, in order to address some of these matters but simply weren't asked. Averaging over \u00c2\u00a3200 per night, this is as I said one of the most expensive hotels I've ever stayed in - I certainly don't feel given the issues above that I got value for money, the standards that the hotel set are nowhere near good enough to justify the cost.

Very close the red light district, cafes, shopping malls and attractions. The staff make you feel comfortable and are very welcoming. The bed in our room was big and comfy. There is a Nespresso machine in our room for all the coffee lovers it's a bonus. Room service food was yummy but not much choice on the menu.

To get to our room you have to go through another set of doors and it's in the staircase area. (strange as I thought executive was meant to be nicer than the average rooms?)

This was booked through a subsidiary of Expedia. I was booked in for a Bed & Breakfast in the Superior category. Arrived and all was well, I requested a room with a bath a opposed to just a shower and was given a room on the 2nd floor. Only downside is that they charge you a deposit of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac75 for extra charges. You can pay this on credit card, but if you only have a debit card, there are costs involved in getting it put back on the card, so I ended up having to pay cash. I also think \u00e2\u201a\u00ac75 deposit for extra charges for 1 night is a bit extreme.... The room itself was a bit meh. I mean, it was nice enough, but really nothing to write home about, some of the furniture looked a little tired and the bed seemed a little tired too, not an evenly shaped mattress. The bathroom was nice, apart from the absolutely horrendous bright white light. I know a bathroom needs decent lighting, but this was seriously OTT and worse than in the worst kind of shop changing rooms, it was industrial light and just offputting. Aircon was great as you can control it yourself. The view was non-existent, other rooms were having a window looking out at only a couple of meters away, meaning curtains have to be closed at all times, making it feel stuffy. The lobby itself is beautiful. Breakfast was great - Dutch breakfast buffets are 10x better than English as they cater for a variety, the fresh fruit & yoghurt were excellent as were the pastries and pancakes. Decent selection of hot drinks too. I then proceeded to check out and was asked whether I had used breakfast. I responded yes as I had a Bed & Breakfast. The lady then told me that breakfast was not included in my room rate! Luckily I had my calendar confirmation which very clearly stated Bed & Breakfast, but it left a bad taste that I felt I had to prove what I had booked or else risk forking out a hefty amount for breakfast - it's not my fault if their booking differs from what I have been given, and they told me 90% of Expedia bookings was room only. Well - I have no idea about that, I can only go by my booking which definitely included breakfast.

Being across from Centraal Station makes it easy to get to around and its close to all of central Amsterdam by foot. Negative, and I presume room location dependent, you deal with Amsterdam traffic noise and the subway construction, especially the piledrivers. Much is outside of the hotel control, but still a consideration for some travelers. I chose the hotel and paid a hefty premium, 200 euro for the night, because I was getting into Schiphol very late, wanted a place close to the city to enjoy Amsterdam the following day before heading back to Schiphol that day. I had booked a single room, and am attempting to ascertain whether the booking agent has a very low priority with the hotel, but the room I was initially given was, by their management's own admission, one of the worst in the hotel. I cannot be certain if the front desk would have acquiesced to my complaint, but a hotel manager heard my anger as I was walking to the front desk. He immediately upgraded my room to an executive room without question. Consequently, I am most grateful that the type of complaint I had was expeditiously and very professionally dealt with by the management. As a consequence, the service given me was excellent at that point, and the issues I have are to a large extent outside their control. While not trying to be ungrateful, the room was a bit tired. I do not know if this was a renovated room, but certainly the furnishings were not. You know the mattress is old when you feel the springs poking out from the mattress under your feet.. Like much of Amsterdam, the prices are out of line for what you get - I have yet to find one that is value for money. This hotel certainly in my opinion is not. While the public areas are grandiose and certainly 4 star, they would need to make me feel more comfortable at a more attractive price to make a repeat visit for a longer stay.

The beds were comfortable and the room and bathroom were clean and modern. The breakfast buffet was also nice with a selection of continental dishes. By no means an american buffet but it did the job. The only complaint I would have is there was not an iron or iron board in the room. I would expect all 4 star and even 3 star hotels to have this as it seems pretty basic to me.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nijm", "Title": "\u201ca terrific job\u201d", "Author": "the_dutch_hans", "ReviewID": "UR106486989", "Content": "we just stayed at our favorite hotel in Amsterdam and they booken us in a brand new room, the designer did a great job, staff as always very friendly and now in combination of renovated rooms!! we can't wait to come back", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d230125-Reviews-Park_Plaza_Victoria_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$190 - $375*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Damrak 1 - 5</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1012 LG</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "230125", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/df/66/01/park-plaza-victoria-amsterdam.jpg"}}
