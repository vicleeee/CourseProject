It is certainly a hotel that has seen better days in the last decades. This place is literally the \u00e2\u20ac\u017ecradle\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 of the Venice Film Festival since the 1930s and has still charisma. The architecture, large corridors and halls convey both a feeling of \u00e2\u20ac\u017eancient grandeur\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 and (unfortunately also) \u00e2\u20ac\u017etristesse\u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The Excelsior in winter would have provided a great film location for the movie \u00e2\u20ac\u017eShining\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 if the setting had taken place at the beachside instead of the mountains\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6:-) The location: the Lido is significantly less touristy than Venice - at least during the tourist \u00e2\u20ac\u017ehigh season\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 in spring and autumn. Hence, if you want to escape the tourist hordes, the Lido is a good location. The disadvantage is certainly to be dependent on boat transfers, but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us too much as the public (water) transport system is very good.

I will be here a total of ten nights. I rarely ever write a review during a trip, but am making an exception on this occasion. Before booking, (in addition of course to mandatory research on tripadvisor), I looked at the hotel's website. There was little in the way of room descriptions and no room pictures, which concerns me as it means the hotel can stick guests in a lower class of room than paid for, without the guest really knowing. Similarly, the standard legal notice (buried deep in a closet in the room, which I saw when putting my clothes away) did not specify the room type and merely said room prices varied from a minimum of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250 to a maximum of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1,050. Again, not very helpful (and not preventing the usual tricks). Despite this, the reviews were generally positive, so we booked. Vittorio, the hotel concierge, competently organised our transfer from the airport to the hotel. It consisted of a driver with a name card waiting for us in the arrivals area, helping us with all the luggage and taking us by car to the (very close) water taxi, and then the water taxi taking us to the canal-side entrance to the hotel. This was seamless and the staff very friendly and helpful (one of our group needed assistance getting in and out of the boat and car, and the staff were very helpful), albeit quite expensive (we paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac216 for four; the cost for two would have been \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200). On entering the hotel, we were greeted by a bell-boy, and eventually found the way to the reception. The hotel facade and (newly decorated) lobby looked amazing. Similarly there is a fabulous (and apparently very famous) white-stucco ceiling reception room, which is breathtakingly beautiful. I read some of the reviews about the common areas being pretty poor - so I'm glad to report the massive improvement (albeit it does not extend to other parts of the hotel - see below). However, this did give me an expectation that the rooms would be similarly fantastic. When I arrived to the room (no-one came up with us to show us the room - which I expect from 5*L hotels), I was quite disappointed with the decor. The size was pretty nice (about 30' by 20' split into two parts by ugly columns, with a long narrow bathroom), but the decor was very 'tired' and made the room very dark. There was dust and dirt visible on some surfaces. Without wishing to sound excessively meledromatic, it looked like a 1970s Hilton. The bathroom was in a terrible state - rust was visible and not particularly clean. The bath was very narrow (which is odd as there was sufficient space for a much wider bath) and the shower needs desperately replacing with something more modern. There was awful water pressure and at about 6:30pm on more than one day, there was no hot water, which is totally inexcusable. I understand there will be a major bedroom refurbishment programme at the end of the season. It couldn't come too soon. Also, the housekeeping is not particularly thorough and they are certainly not 'efficient' - on some days the room was not cleaned until late afternoon. The main dining room (on the third floor with the amazing white stucco ceiling) is staffed by waiters who I pray are contractors rather than permanent. They are utterly incompetent and - with a few exceptions - are totally incomprehensible and did not listen and certainly could not speak English. They are not familiar with the day's menu. On more than one occasion, upon sitting down in the restaurant, it took up to 30 minutes for the waiter to even bring us the menu. 'Faulty Towers' comes to mind. I really liked the maitre'd (a chap called Baldo), who did his best to intervene when a problem is escalated to him (such as waiting an hour for a main course, only for one to arrive but not the others, and for it to go cold while the others took another 30 minutes to arrive) but the quality of the other staff was shocking and there is a limit to what one person can achieve. The waiters (except Baldo) should pretty much all be fired. Finally - and perhaps my biggest concern - is the total lack of visibility of senior hotel management. They don't really seem to care. I was told by some of the other guests that this is typical 'Venetian' behaviour. My feelings were shared by some of the other guests we met around the hotel. However, if you don't mind the above, and have little expectations of service once you're in the hotel, and don't expect to ever see a senior manager, you could do a lot worse.

It was just as quiet and wonderful like expected: after the deck chairs are removed and the noisy bars closed down along the beaches ot the Lido, the walk along the empty beaches in the soft autumn sun was just wonderful. The hotel interior has seen better days in terms of interior styling: a somewhat carelessly furnished lobby and hall is not the grand welcome one expects at such a place. But the sweeping view of the sea is there to make up for the disappointment. The rooms are really spacious and well equipped. Mine had a terrace with a marvellous view of the sea; my friend was disappointed with her \"Venice view\" which was almost not visible (it's too far away). Breakfast both from the buffet in the hall and served in the room (to be enjoyed on the terrace) was excellent. Venice itself was accessible quite easily. But one has to mind that the boat service provided by the Excelsior leaves only once per hour and the boat ride will take approx. 20 minutes.

The breakfast, which was included in the rate we booked on Venere, was probably the best we have ever had anywhere, with hot as well as cold dishes, and gorgeous fresh fruit. We stayed here because my husband was attending a conference at the conference centre nearby, so the hotel was fully booked. The staff at reception seemed overtaxed. I asked whether the room to which we had been assigned was quiet and the response was that we had a lovely view of the lagoon. Sounded good to us until we got there and realized that we would get all the noise of the boats and of the road running along that side of the hotel. We tried turning on the air conditioning to see if it would drown out the noise, but the air conditioning wasn't working. After trying to call the front desk, which didn't answer, back down we went to wait in line again. We were moved to a room over a quiet courtyard, and the room was spacious and elegant. We were also advised that the air conditioning was not turned on by law that regulates it's use in May and October in hotels, but they would send up a fan. We went to Venice on their free launch, which makes the hotel's location on the Lido manageable, and arrived back late to find the fan had not arrived. We thought we could manage without, but the room was very stuffy and our sleep was poor. Back we went the next morning to ask for our fan and advise them the curtains did not close completely and neither the sink nor bathtub stoppers worked. They promised me someone would fix everything as soon as they came to work at 9 am. Luckily I was in the room at 10 when someone arrived with the fan. I showed him the other problems, of which he seemed unaware, and he promised they would be fixed, which they then were. Minor quibbles, but not quite what I expect at a 5 star hotel. Nonetheless, I would certainly stay here again if I came to Venice with children or wanted a beach retreat, as pool and beach are lovely. I had an enjoyable walk to the Jewish cemetery on the other side of the Lido just past the ferry dock. If you walk along the path on the side opposite the water, you can see it through a locked gate in a red brick wall. If you turn back about a quarter of a block to the closest road, you ca see an arch and a flower stand outside the Catholic cemetery. Walk past the flowers stand to the arch and there is a bell to ring. This cemetery is unlike any Jewish cemetery I have ever seen, including the one in Ferrara. There are huge family monuments, one with a dome and alabaster windows, much like some of the churches.

On every visit - without fail - I still feel a huge sense of excitement and anticipation, a thoroughly seductive sense of glamour, hedonism, holiday and uplift. Lately I've taken to going over in August, a perfect time to visit the Excelsior for a quiet interlude of uninterrupted self-indulgence before the Venice Film Festival. For a couple of unhurried weeks it is easy to see why this was Winston Churchill's favourite hotel in Venice. The combination, unusual for his time and ours, of spatial grandeur and patrician informality never fails to inspire creativity and revitalise frayed nerves. The Excelsior goes from strength to strength under the management of Leone Jannuzzi and his team. Long may it last. The Lido is quiet in August, with very few foreign tourists in evidence. The beaches are populated by groups of impeccably behaved Italians enjoying a warm, temperate and peaceful Adriatic. Even with the pre-Festival hype, it is very nearly impossible to imagine this tranquillity being shattered in September as it is every year, when the Excelsior is packed to its minarets for a fortnight with stars, directors and their entourages. Excursions: A typical day in August might begin, as ours usually does, with an early morning walk or bicycle ride to Alberoni or San Nicolo, sufficiently bracing to appease the semi-dormant work ethic. The next step, when you've witnessed the sun rise and heard the dawn chorus, is a champagne breakfast at the Excelsior, a swim in either the sea or the pool and a stroll around the cluster of nearby art deco villas. Later the Tavernetta, the restaurant opposite the hotel, was sufficiently laid back last August for its owner to conjure up, after closing time, a late lunch of bruschetta and gnocchi. Afternoon tea at the golf club in Alberoni was entertaining, an agreeably eccentric amalgam of long-forgotten English, American and Italian values: ancient and unimpeachably shabby sofas and armchairs, cases of tarnished trophies, Ivy League-style honours boards, photos of the Duke of Windsor and Henry Ford - and distant but still unsettling reminders of Mussolini's meeting with Hitler here in the early Thirties. Back at the Lion's Bar, in the early evening, there was nobody about but a dazed-looking barefoot blonde, possibly the ghost of a Fellini extra, dancing slowly back and forth under a massive glitterball. Practicalities: the Excelsior has a luxurious and extremely useful motor-launch that plies to and fro from Venice - it's only 15 minutes to San Marco; the Excelsior's beach cabins are legendary - but if they're slightly out of budget then a sunbed and parasol are ideal (non-residents often opt for these and they cost about 100 Euros, something of a treat but well worth it for access to the immaculately-kept private beach); breakfast here is great - champagne, bacon and eggs and so on - I saw a charming vignette last year when, at breakfast, a solicitous member of staff invited in two very sedate, elderly nuns who were walking slowly along the beach to their convent - they stayed a while for coffee rather than champagne; the Blue Bar mixes great martinis; there is an excellent children's club offering well-organised activities in all weathers (there is a charming children's cabin in a discreet corner of the swimming pool area).

They leave little treats on the bed when they turn it down. They even tucked in a stuffed bear I take with me when we travel. Very sweet.

It picks up from San Marco at 13:30, 15:30, and so on. The ride was nice but I did get a little sea sick. As far as restaurants on Lido, there are several decently priced if you don't want to go back to Venice. Just exit the hotel, make a right and walk about 3/4 mile. They're near the ferry dock.

We were blessed with great weather which was a bonus for exploring Venice. As we approached the hotel for the first time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c using their free water shuttle that we boarded at the starwood jetty outside the Danieli Hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we all gasped at the wonderful exterior of the building and the beautiful lagoon where the hotels private jetty is situated. We were helped off by the friendly captain, and walked into the hotel along the impressive red carpet corridor. We were disappointed to note that all the glass cabinets were empty and no paintings were hanging on the walls so the place felt a bit dead and hollow. The spa was closed, and the shops were too, and never opened whilst we were there. Perhaps gearing up for the close season prematurely. The reception was grand but again lacked some paintings/tapestries/decoration on the huge white washed walls. All the staff were very friendly and helpful and we were soon off to find our room. On entry my wife commented how lovely the room was, and it was of enormous size too. The bathroom had twin sinks and the bed was very comfy. We had a balcony that overlooked the sea, from which we noticed a big digger, pushing the sand up into a bank \u00e2\u20ac\u201c preparing for the winter storms. This added to the feel that the hotel was gearing up for the close season a bit early with rooms full of guests. We were spoiled by the hotel with a bottle of Prosecco and bowl of fruit, as it was our anniversary. A very kind and pleasingly accepted gesture. The prices of food and drink (as in most of Venice) are very expensive. A pint is 10 euros (\u00c2\u00a39!!!) A main course is about 35 euros (\u00c2\u00a332 for 1 course!) needless to say we ate out in restaurants (as we always do though to experience the citys nightlife) Venice is an extortionists paradise. One restaurant it was 18 euros for a pint of beer, 120 euros for an average bottle of prosecco and in another at lunch time we paid 12 euros for a sandwich and 8 euros for a cappuccino. My wife is Italian and we go to Italy a lot and this is by far the most expensive place we have visited. Breakfast was very good, a wide selection of fruit, pastries, cooked eggs/bacon, toast, meats, juices and the infamous complimentary prosecco. The cooked breakfast isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all that- the bacon soggy and the eggs overcooked, but the selection available is wonderful. Overall the hotel was lovely if you can get it for a good price on a last minute website, but it is in no way a 5* hotel as advertised. I would say 3-4*s The rooms are excellent however, and the free shuttle service to and from Venice will save you a lot of money in taxi fares.

It's not a Four Seasons, it's not a 5 star with unparalleled service, but it is a nice, roomy hotel away from the St Mark's Square crowds with a cool nostalgic vibe and on the beach with a pool. We slept in a big King size bed with our 2 yr old and they brought in a free bed for our 9 yr old. I would come back. The free water taxi is a nice touch too. Here are some tips for you - 1. The free hotel water taxi leaves every 30 mins on the hour, but if it is high tide it leaves at 5 past and 35 past from the casino dock. They point up the street and tell you it's only 3 mins away but it is a bit tricky to find so best to give yourself a bit extra time to find the casino dock as there is no signage. You want to go left after walking a couple blocks. 2. If you are trying to find the free water taxi stand named St Mark's you have to go to St Mark's and then walk over a bridge and find the tiny stand along the water that says \"Starwood\". Hard to find at night. 3. I highly recommend the Guggenheim Museum. You can take the free hotel water taxi to Hotel Gritti and if you are too lazy to walk around, there is a little gondola service exactly outside the hotel that will take you across the canal for 50 cents - just look for the line of lazy people waiting. 4. You get free breakfast buffett at the hotel downstairs. I thought it was great! 5. You can take a hired water taxi to the airport. That will set you back 110 Euros. We took a cab to the dock in Lido (15 Euros), then the public water taxi (13 Euros each) and it took about an hour to get to the airport. Do the math if you have a party of 4 or more to see if it's worth it. I am sure you could get to the airport in about 30 mins in a water taxi. The line at security at the airport took about 45 mins the day we were there! 6. The taxis in Lido start at 7 or 10 Euros so a bit dear to take cabs in Lido. 7. The hotel has an awesome workout equip gym that was totally empty when I was there. 8. The bar has cool photos on the wall of Hollywood stars from the 50s. Female bartender was friendly. 9. Gondola rides in Venice are 100 Euros! Must be some union with a monopoly as they did not want to negotiate or budge off the price. We skipped it. 10.They have a business center, but they try to sell you a little time card. I told the reception person that all I wanted to do was print out my boarding pass and she gave me a free pass. The internet connection was slow and in the end I could not get to the website anyway. Good luck find the @ symbol on their keyboard. You have to hit a combination of keys to get it! 11. The further you venture from the maddening crowds at St Mark's square the better. Put the maps away and just walk and get lost and enjoy the uniqueness of the place. Have fun!

Secondly, I'm very mixed overall on this hotel; its old and not greatly kept up. The room decor is wierd and not that of a luxury hotel at all. We were wondering why the weird decor wasn't mentioned in any of the other reviews. The staff was adequate but not great. They were kind of the most dissappointing part of the hotel. They were helpful but it was like pulling teeth. The lady at the check-in, Francesca, was the epitomy of this. She wasn't mean or anything but not warm at all. We heard about her in some other reviews. The staff in general wasn't hospitable like you would expect from a luxury hotel. They would help you but it didn't really seem like they wanted to or enjoyed assisting. The rate we got for the room was okay but the restaurant, bar, and everything extra was a colossal ripoff. I also got some kind of scabie-like, mite infestation on my skin when staying there so that sucked. Positives: Free breakfast buffet was good, the pool situation was great. Clean pool, lots of lounge chairs and we went early July so it wasn't super crowded there; while it was super crowded in Venice. Not sure what we would've done if we stayed in Venice all day so the pool was a good situation to relax while it was really hot and crowded in Venice. Also, the free boat shuttle to Venice is clutch but without that this hotel would be just too inconvenient to Venice. Overall, we were glad we stayed there because it was away from the Venice crowds and the pool gave us a place to relax in the hot day but it looks like the hotel is resting on its beach location/movie festival location laurels. The other reviews for this hotel are way too high and you should temper your expectations if you plan on staying here. Not the full package you would expect from a luxury resort.

I am glad to report that the hotel is just as wonderful as it was, in particular the highly professional staff providing very individual service in spite of the size of the hotel: The concierges are top-notch, remembering your name and room number and providing great advice and recommendations. At the pool (which was a bit cool mid May but became warmer every day), as you indicate your preferred sunbed, the attendant will upholster it with a matress and three (!) towels. At breakfast, the waiter remembers your drink orders from the morning before etc. In short: true five-star service. We had a vast seaview room at the beginning of our stay and were then moved to a slightly smaller (still huge for Venice standards) lagoon-side room in the 6th floor with an unforgettable view over the lagoon, Venice and the snow-capped mountains in the back. Both rooms were decorated in the hotels signature moorish style and perfectly cleaned (twice daily maid service, towels being changed also on the occasion of turn-down service). It seemed to us that the season really only starts mid May, when the pool gets warm enough to swim in and when it's possible to have breakfast in the open-air restaurant at the beach and I believe that mid May to late June is the perfect time to come to this hotel. Also, by the end of May, the very efficient (and very memorable) complimentary motorboat-service to St. Mark's square (10/15 minutes ride) changes from an hourly to a half-hourly schedule and at the beginning of June, the hotel's private beach opens. As expected in a hotel of this class, the extras are very expensive (minibar, internet, room-service and food and drinks in general), but we perfectly managed to enjoy our stay without spending too much at the hotel - as mentioned, the concierges are happy to provide excellent recommendations for all budgets. A small point of critique: at breakfast, the orange juice dispensers don't look very elegant nor does the juice (from concentrate) taste very good. The waiters happily bring freshly squeezed juice on request though.

We used it regularily, takes about 20 minutes and is a great freebie. The rooms are nice, I have seen better bathrooms in 5 star hotels, but they were clean and well furnished, and thge maid service was excellent. It haslo has a fabulous beach and pool (cold!!). The prices for drinks and food are way above anywhere else, it seems to be a standard thing now that hotels of this stature feel that 8 euro for a small beer is acceptable. We just accepted it, but some may not, because you can afford such a hotel does not necessarily mean you should have to pay over the odds for such items. Venice - there is no need to say what you should see, but the maxim go and get lost is a good one, do so, and you will never be bored. Just by getting 'lost' we saw all teh things we wanted to see, the Rialto Bridge, the Grand Canal and so on. It was hot, so standing in the long queues to get into the Doges or San Marco were a no-no. The Hotel taxi pick up and drop is by the Bridge of Sighs at the Starwood quay. Finally - taxis are an incrediblt expensive item. Hotel to Airport on the final day - 130 euro.
