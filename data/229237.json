It sits only a block off of Dam Square and is at most a 20 minute walk from almost anywhere. We didn't use a train or taxi on either of our stays. The rooms are nice. Although the hotel is non-smoking, on our first stay there was a little bit of a smokey smell in the room, likely left over from when the hotel did have smoking. On our second stay there was no smell. The second room we stayed in had been renovated. We went in March when air conditioning was not needed, but I noticed that they are in the process of renovated the AC system.

The best thing about the hotel is it's location... right behind Dam Square which is a great base for your trip to Amsterdam. Nothing is far from here.

After reading reviews about the hotel we were a little wary about our stay, however I am pleased to say the stay was very pleasant. The location of the hotel is great. Yes, the rooms are very small (at least the one we had was) and there was just a single wardrobe with 5 coat hangers to store our clothes resulting in us living out of the suitcase. Cleaniness is always an important issue for me and I was't disappointed although the toilet could have done with a drop of bleach. Our view from our room was other rooms, but this did not bother us too much. I am sure a room at the front of the building would have been better, but this did not spoil our stay. The reception staff were very helpful and polite and gave us plenty of advice. The bar was clean and a nice place to sit and have a quiet drink of an evening. Once again polite and helpful staff. We did not eat at the hotel as we did feel the prices were rather high. We did find a small steak resturant called El Rancho. It does look a dive I have to be honest, but we were very surprised by their very good value steak meal. It was very tastey, a good sized portion and served with a smile. Don't let appearences put you off. We did all the usual tourist things and on our last day took the bus tour of Amsterdam. This revealed several things we would have like to have visited but had now run out of time.

If we had had a cat, we certainly could not have swung it without hitting its head! We were in what appeared to be part of the attic. Considering we had booked many months before and had requested a room with a view over Dam Square, this was disappointing to say the least. I went down to reception to ask if they had any other rooms as ours was so awful, and they said they were full. Considering this was a Thursday night in early December, I find that hard to believe. The staff were very unhelpful and obstructive. I asked for the manager's name, and they refused to give it to me, which I thought was a bit odd. They said I could talk to him in the morning when he came in, but that was not going to solve the problem of being in a room not much bigger than a broom cupboard for that night. I have stayed in larger boat cabins than this. In the end, we did not bother moving. We were tired and were only there for 3 days anyway, so we decided to put up with it, but the staff's attitude was very disappointing. Some other observations about our room and the hotel: - There were two doors in the room, leading to the attic space around which cold draughts blew, making the room very cold. - The room was quite shoddy and tired looking and not particularly clean - Normally when you bump into the room maids, they are friendly, but not the one we saw - she had a very sour expression! One morning, we went to make ourselves a cup of tea and found that she had only put one clean mug on the tray, leaving the old dirty one from the day before - The hotel bar closed at 10.30pm each night, so we had to go outside for a drink, where there were lots of bars open. Seems a bit odd to close so early - The location is good, being only half a minute from Dam Square, so if you don't mind a poor quality room etc, it will be OK. Overall, this was a very shoddy hotel with unfriendly staff and a very small room and no view.

Walls were dirty and marked and looked like not cleaned. Someone else's leftover sock in the baggage rack is consistent with that view. Curtains had multiple holes from what looked like cigarette burns; some were repaired with needle and thread. Main curtains when drawn had 6 inch gap in the centre and did not meet. THe \"bed\" was hard, and bed head comprised of two parts; one looked like single bed and the other a double. Head lamps were positioned perfectly... to bump one's head if one tried to sit up to read. Bed hard, and no air-conditioning; sign said under repair. Room noisy from street noise all night despite window closed despite the heat and no air-con, and the street lights and curtain gap meant that when we work up hourly we thought it was day time. We were in room 103 at back of hotel away from trams on other side. We left 6am next day and did not bother to have breakfast. I have given same comments to staff of hotel and have additional photos to back up my statement that I will provide to the hotel wholesaler back here. I find it hard to believe that a single hotel will have some disgusting rooms and some wonderful ones, and thus can only speculate about the reasons behind the variability of reviews of this hotel on TRipAdvisor, which I actually reviewed before staying there. A hotel that cannot provide a clean room with functioning air conditioning and curtains that close is not worthy of any stars.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cTerrible!\u201d", "Author": "Nadine1969", "ReviewID": "UR114783323", "Content": "smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in and its a double.

The heat in the room didn't seem to work either, although I didn't know it at the time the maintenance guy was there.

The bathroom shower misfunctions most of the time, and when working fluctuates wildly from hot to cold like most cheap hotels with inadequate hot water. No toiletries are provided, and soap is instead from wall dispensers. The ceiling in the room is low, and is concrete, making clear that there is no means of expanding the room size. In the bathroom, the ceiling was covered by mildew. Our room had two small windows overlooking a court yard with, as indicated by a prior reviewer, a view of a wall 15 feet away. In the United States, this room would have been illegal because there is no fire escape--exiting the windows would result in a four story drop onto ventilation equipment surrounded by four, six story walls and no door. The common areas in the lobby and the restaurant area are more up to date. The staff is not bad, but there is no bell service, and the cashiers incompetently function as unknowing concierages.

I was taken there by my husband to celebrate my 50th birthday and as my husband told the hotel in advance we were presented with a free drink voucher and 25% discount for dinner (which was very good). Best attraction was candle lit cruise with unlimited wine and cheeses, the Heinieken and Anne Frank. Worsed and hopeless one was the Ice Bar.

As there was snow on the ground and was slightly worried about delayed flights and getting stuck for a couple of days in another country without a hotel room and ATOL protection I decided to book through a travel agent and pay in the region of \u00c2\u00a3850 for 3 nights B&B and flights. On arrival at the hotel we where really impressed with the check in, however I was slightly bemused when my credit card was charged \u00c2\u00a383 to cover any damages that may occur during our stay?? (Now in the hands of credit card dispute department as money taken without authority). On arrival to our our room (607) I was really dismayed to see a small room with a double bed pushed against the the wall and every bit of floor space taken up with either chairs, or a table.etc (I could not sit on the floor by the side of the bed and put my shoes on due to lack of space. The room looked like a single with a double bed put in it.). To top matters off the room must have been a smoking room at one stage as the ceiling and walls where tinged with yellow. The bathroom was not much better. As it was -7 outside I would have liked some heat, however with the radiator half hanging off we could not get it to turn on. There was a maintainence tag to put on the door which we put out on the first morning for housekeeping, however that was simply placed back in our room every day and no action taken to fix the problems. On the second day my girlfriend came back to our room as she forgot her camera. When she got back our room door was wide open where housekeeping had been in, then left it wide open for ANYONE else to come in as they please after they had finished. Then only good thing about the hotel is the honesty and politness of the bar staff and the way in which they are meant to serve meals, run the bar, keep bar tabs and keep the bar clean as well as serving coffee in reception at the same time.

On returning to the hotel an hour later they had miraculously found us a room, although it was \"smoking\". Reluctantly accepted due to lack of alternatives. Room (on top floor - to be avoided) was DISGUSTING - the smell was almost unbearable, it was tiny with minute windows which barely let in any light and the decor was dated and dirty looking. Went out for the evening having left the door open to air. On return to hotel the staff had again miraculously found a smoker who wanted to swap their relatively nice \"upgraded\" room with our foul stinking pit - although this was quite clearly a lie as the room we got had a balcony so they could easily have nipped out for a fag. The room we eventually had was okay - big for Amsterdam but with rather knackered beds and again, the decor was extremely tired-looking and the room smelled musty, like it was recently converted from smoking to non-smoking.

Depending on what you are going to Amsterdam for, this hotel is a only minutes walk from the Red light district, Bars & coffeeshops. There is a tram(1) stop right outside the hotel which will take you to Leidseplein and beyond and the other side of the royal palace is another tram(4, 16) stop that will take you to Rembrandt square. There is a shopping centre next to the hotel and a supermarket 400 yards past that. Vondel Park is very nice and worth a walk round, Don't forget the giant IAmsterdam letters.

This time the visit was a nightmare. We had booked way in advance, to the hotel direct, via their internet site - an Executive Double for my husband and I and a twin-bedded Superior Room (single occupancy) for my niece. I particlularly requested that both rooms should be on the 3rd floor, and this booking was confirmed by e mail. When we arrived my niece was given a tiny single-bedded, dark, dingey room on the first floor. When I complained they moved her to a double-bedded room on the 2nd Floor - but unortunately this was also dark, dingey and very small. The window faced on to a brick wall in the centre of the building, and consequently the room was very noisy. We were told that there were no Superior rooms available on the 3rd Floor that day (this was a Monday) but that they could possibly move her again on the Tuesday. There was no point in arguing at the time as the Man on the Desk was very unhelpful. Our next complaint was that on previous visits there had been porters to assist with the luggage (my husband is registered disabled) but there were none in attendance during the 4 days that we were at the hotel, and no other member of staff offered to help. Also, with no explanation, the Blue Bar (one of the features of the hotel) was closed on the Monday evening. On the Tuesday and Wednesday (day and night) the 'historic' restaurant was also closed, with no explanation. We were told that we could eat in the Blue Bar, which was then open. We did not feel inclined to pay restaurant, silver-service prices for a meal served in a public bar, with wooden tables, draughts and uncomfortable chairs, so we ate out instead. To sum up - this time hotel was grossly understaffed; the service was appalling (apart from one young man on Reception); the corridors smelt badly of drains and neglect; it was very disconcerting to see a Rentokil van parked outside the hotel on the Tuesday; the price of the rooms was way too high (compared to other local hotels) considering the low standard.

Unfortunately our the other weekend was far from that and I would have huge reservations about the hotel as a going concern. The following goes through my visit and subsequent problems in chronological order: - My girlfriend and I checked in on Friday evening at about 6pm or so, were greeted by a male member of staff whose name I unfortunately do not recall, I was asked as normal for credit card verification, this appeared to be completed correctly and we were directed to our room. Unfortunately this room was a twin room and was not what I had booked and had confirmation for from my reservation, I had requested a double. This issue was soon rectified and we were moved to room 407. - We were planning to go out that Friday evening and my girlfriend took a shower, when she came out she said the shower was too hot and she had huge difficulty adjusting the temperature correctly having nearly burnt herself on a few occasions. I showered after and found the adjustment on the shower far too sensitive also \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I would consider this dangerous. - The next issue we experienced was that the lighting in the room was not sufficient as at least one of the bulbs on the bedside light was blown. - We then went out for some dinner and a few beers during which at approximately 10 - 11pm I got a telephone message from my credit card company that I was to call them immediately. I did so and I was transferred to card security directly, they were considerably concerned about four transactions which had been either attempted or completed from Die Port Van Cleve. The first three transactions attempted to take \u00e2\u201a\u00ac600 from my account, the final attempted a transaction for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac49,883.33. These transactions obviously drew serious attention from the credit card company and they advised to return to the hotel immediately and possibly call the police, following which I should call them back and advise if the card should be cancelled. At this stage they also advised that my credit limit had been exceeded and there were no funds available on my card, I was extremely shocked and rang the hotel immediately. I found and still find it very hard to understand how these four transactions had been required when all I was aware of at check in was a credit verification, i.e. a confirmation that funds were available in my account. At no stage during the check in process was I made aware that a transaction was being completed and at no stage did I authorize by signature or pin that funds should be transferred. I was also very surprised at the figure of the transactions, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac600 this was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac130 more than my room rate less local tax? This is aside from the fact that four different transactions were attempted on the card and a final transaction of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac49883.33? but I am struggling to understand why and how this was used a payment amount? In any case after a discussion with the hotel there was little I could do that evening and was more than extremely annoyed. - Not least because I would be unable to use my credit card for dinner and for the remainder of my time in Amsterdam. - There was a final surprise on this visit for my girlfriend which again was a complete embarrassment, this happened on Saturday evening. I had gone downstairs for a beer before going out for dinner, she was getting ready to go out and while looking for a shoe she came across a used condom sitting under our bed. She immediately came down stairs to let me know and I made Nina aware of the situation. This was something that I would hope to never encounter anywhere let alone in a 4* hotel room. At this stage I also made Nina aware of the lighting and shower problems in the room, she said there was little she could do at that time aside from remove the condom. The only gesture during our entire stay in the hotel was that we were offered a late check out on Sunday and this was only after I had asked what time I could check out! At no time during the stay was a manager made available to discuss the situation, I subsequently found out that one was available for a period on Saturday afternoon from Christa during check out but he/she was not directed toward me? I am shocked that this would not have been a priority given the level of incompetency and carelessness shown with my credit card. I cannot say how embarrassed and annoyed I was during the weekend, I recommended this hotel to my girlfriend and told her it would be more than suitable for our stay in Amsterdam for her birthday celebration. Nearly as annoying was the inconvenience of having to pay cash for the weekend and also the fact I was also hoping to buy some items during our visit in Amsterdam but as my credit card limit was exceeded this was impossible. At this stage the more I think about it the more I am annoyed. This is not what I would expect from a 4* hotel anywhere in the world let alone in Europe.

The bedding however was lovely cotton and very comfortable, the bathroom was clean and acceptable, however we couldnt have stayed in there.

A taxi to the hotel cost us about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac55. Doesnt look great from the outside-but the old saying about judging a book by its cover springs to mind. Inside is really warm and welcoming. Our room was on the fifth floor and was really bright and was a decent size. We had 3 steps going down to the bedroom from a short little hall way inside the door. Bed was big and comfortable. Room had no air conditioning though so we did have to leave the window open a lot. I read reports of the place looking tired and dated-I didnt think this at all. Room was clean and didnt look out of date at all. View from the window was a rooftop but thats not a big deal (if you want to see something go outside). The second room was on the 4th floor and seemed a lot smaller (all one level didnt have the corridor and steps). The other couple commented on the differance in room size. Both rooms were booked at the same time and booked exactly the same. To be honest I wouldnt have been as happy with my friends room. On site is the famous steak restaurant. Wasnt great. You can order either a 6oz or 9 oz steak done to your liking (or so they say) and its served with veg and fries. The steak itself wasnt anything special to be honest and wasnt quite well done as requested. That was a disapointment as we had heard so many good things about it. The room service menu was pretty standard. (standard as in choice-food was nice). Beware of the room service breakfast though-its very expensive and not nice. Special mention goes to the barman Jorge (spelling?) who was great. The hotel bar was really cool and we favoured staying there over any of the bars/clubs around the city. Real old-fashioned set-up-wooden tables candles etc. Reception staff were really helpful at both check-in and check-out and helping us with directions and travel advice. Hotel location is great with in easy walking distance to Anne Frank, Madame Tussuads, shopping area and Red Light District. There is a large shopping mall and supermarket on the same street. There is a Tram stop outside the hotel and Centraal Station is 10 minutes walk away.

We agree that the location is by far the best in Amsterdam. The hotel is housed in a historical building off of Vorburgwal. It is directly behind the Royal Palace, Niew Kerk, and Dam Square. All of the major tram lines are within steps of the building; though riding the tram was hardly necessary, as a majority of the sights were within a short and enjoyable walk. Our room was very small (even for Europe), but it was comfortable. It had a lot of character and we really enjoyed it. I have read other reviews that state that the rooms smell like mildew. This is probably because everywhere in Amsterdam is surrounded by water. A slight mildew smell should be expected anywhere, especially in historical buildings. Our only complaint was the breakfast. It cost about 18 euro, and was not worth 2 euro. The \"hot\" food was very cold, and nothing was replenished (even with a full dining room). This was only an inconvenience, because for some reason, Dutch restaraunts don't open until like 11 (even if they do serve breakfast). Being that the hotel restaraunt was the only place open we were very disappointed.

Overall, we liked the place, but having already visited TripAdvisor, we knew not to expect 4 star accommodations.", "Date": "June 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincoln, UK", "Title": "\u201cDefinately not a 4 Star Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3528737", "Content": "Stayed in June 2005 - Upon arrival we were given a room which was in an annex to the hotel, although it was small, clean, warm and basic there was a damp smell and the room looked directly into another hotel room window. Noise was constant but expected because of the location. Our rooms were not cleaned on a daily basis and beware of the 'excellent deal for pizza' at night costing 5 euros - which turns into 25 euros because of the service charge. Positives: Good location, friendly staff.

The staff was very nice and young, very helpful. The room vas not very clean and we are still asking ourselves why we never had any shampoo or anything in our bathroom. the hotel needs new paints, the corridors and rooms look so old. The continental brreakfast was all right. The location is downtown, near Dam place. Ask for a room behind and not in front of the noisy street. I wouldn't like to talk about pay per view but I have too. 13 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac for a few minutes, no preview, and no adult control !!
