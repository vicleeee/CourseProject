I could not have asked for a better location for the price. For under $100 a night, you do not get much better in a city like Madrid. Located just a minute walk from Santo Domingo, and a 10minute walk from Puerta Sol and the Royal Palace, you are never far from the sights. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the street may not look safe at first glance but there is a police station 2 buildings away from the hotel. I felt safe even at night. The property smells like air freshener the moment you walk in and the smell is stronger in the lobby area. The wifi is free in the rooms and the signal is great but the connection speed is slow. We got by and honestly you just need enough to look up a few restaurants here and there for your stay anyway. We had plenty of space in our inner-facing room on the 5th floor and the rooms were clean. I just had two complaints about the rooms: the bedding, and the heat. The bed is hard but what makes it worse is the coarseness of the sheets. I got rashes on my elbows from lying on the bed and watching TV. The room also has no heat control which makes it a bit unbearable on the hotter afternoons. We kept the windows open the whole time but it still felt uncomfortably hot at times. The hotel is pleasant and the staff are helpful but I definitely would not say it is a 4-star hotel, even in Europe.

I knew from previously visiting lovely Madrid that a central location is very important for a hotel, because distances can be huge there. It is a vast and diverse city. The metro is very clean, cheap and efficient but who wants to spend half of each day travelling ? I booked a lastminute.com \"Top secret Hotel\" listed as near the Plaza de Espana for a very attractive price thinking i could bear almost anything for two nights as long as it was central. When the name and location were revealed I was very pleased, the Hotel Coloso has one of the best downtown locations for exploring by foot in all Madrid. Easy to find and reach, a short walk from either Plaza De Espana or Santo Domingo metro stations the Hotel Coloso looks modern and attractive on first view, its polished granite facings standing out against the old brownstones. Reception is not opulent but is comfortable and welcoming. The night receptionist who greeted my late arrival was charm itself, assigning me room 616 in the attic. I also took advantage of the \u20ac10 breakfast offer. Access to the roofspace rooms is quaint, but no hassle with my small travel case. It was a converted attic room, with a velux window.overlooking Madrileno rooftops. Not a panoramic view, but a very interesting one ! The room was somewhat tired in decoration , but well appointed with a splendid bathroom, modern TV and huge queen sized bed. The aircon and heater worked well, but i did not need them during my stay. The room was perfectly warm enough against the winter hill without extra heat. The bed was firm and comfortable, just as I liked it, but the mattress was sagging somewhat. The room faced the street, and being next to a police station meant there was street noise and sirens, but as for me I EXPECT such when I visit an exciting metropolis like Madrid. The double glazed velux window kept 99% of such sound out anyway. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and of good quality. The cafe con leche from the machines there was heavenly, and fresh juices and breads abounded. Staff again were very efficient and friendly. The day staff helped me with maps and information, again highly commended. Downsides ? No bar or restaurant was a pity, but these are easily found in this quarter of Madrid. Also looking back I think that the attic rooms of the sixth floor are reserved for \"internet bargain\" travellers, as I caught a glimpse of a suite on the 5th floor when it was being serviced and it was a class above in appointments and opulence than mine, but I have no complaints. A lick of paint in the attic rooms is all that is required. All in all the Hotel Coloso added hugely to my weekend in Madrid, and for the price I paid ( \u20ac50 per day) for a comfortable and safe city-centre hotel i would recommend it strongly for independent travellers.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cexcellent location, good hotel\u201d", "Author": "uddina", "ReviewID": "UR122413301", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel in July 2011, the hotel is centrally located, near to a few tube stations and is very clean and comfortable!

A word of warning, the only station on the TV that plays anything in english is German MTV and a 24 hour news channel, also, Hulu and Netflix watch instantly don't work outside the U.S. So, if you're looking to relax for a couple of hours before going out again, bring a book or music or something...or you can always watch South Park in German (or the Jersey Shore - which is surprisingly popular in Germany)...oh speaking of internet...there's free wifi and our signal was crystal clear. So, yes, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who gets that being in Madrid is about walking around, eating food, and using the hotel room to sleep and shower.

Sadly these were missing but apart from this it scrubbed up very nicely. Sara at reception (as mentioned in another review) spoke excellent English so deal with her if at all possible. The rest of the staff's English was not quite as good as it could be, to the extent that, when we called down to reception to ask how to use the safe (for this you need to put a 20 euro deposit down for the key), someone answered the phone then left me hanging to find someone who spoke English to answer my query. He left me waiting for so long that i just hung up. When we checked in the man on the desk was more concerned with answering the phone than dealing with us in person so we waited for around 10 minutes before even being acknowledged. Having said all that, their English is still better than my Spanish. We did not have breakfast here as it seemed too expensive though the restaurant looked very nice. Plenty of cafes nearby where you can grab a quick coffee and a pastry. The hotel is located on a very busy side street which had roadworks outside during our stay so if we weren't kept awake by revellers on their way home, we were awakened by the drilling which started at 8.30. Having said all that though, we did know this before we booked so were aware of what we were letting ourselves in for. The plus side of the location was therefore its proximity to the city's sights. A 2 minute walk from Santo Domingo metro station but equally within 5/10 minutes walk of the Royal Palace at Plaza Oriente, (free on Wednesdays) 10/15 minutes from the cathedral and within 20 minutes of Plaza Mayor and Puerta de Sol. So really near to everything you need to visit (worth getting the metro to Retiro Park though). The bullring museum was 9 stops away at Ventas. We would also recommend getting a coach out to visit the city of Toledo (less than an hour on the direct coach from Plaza Eliptica), a beautiful medieval walled city with a host of more free exhibitions. We would recommend the direct coach though not the stopping one as this seemed to take forever on the way out. Also worth a visit was the Prado art exhibition in Madrid (around a 15/20 minute walk), free after 6pm, and in fact to be honest there wasn't much that we actually did pay for!

I booked on Expedia and the hotel lobby meets the pictures on that site. The hotel seems to be composed of an older and a newer section. Two quite separate elevator systems serve those and the old back part has tortuous steps to negotiate before getting to the old, albeit always working elevators. The room was fairly spacious and everything in the en-suite shower room/ half-bath worked well. WiFi was promised and inquiry at the desk indicated that it only works in the lobby. Wrong!

We stayed at the Hotel El Coloso from the 7-9 of June 2007 and was pleasantly surprised. I had never stayed at a hotel in Europe (always stayed with friends/family) and frankly, was afraid after reading reviews. I know that four star hotels in the US are luxury whereas in Europe are bare bones. I expected a dank, small room in a crumbling hotel with rude staff. I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived at 8:30AM and the staff allowed us to check in immediately (check in is sometime between 10AM - 12PM) We booked a double but received a gigantic room that slept 4. I won't bore you with the rest but will break it down into pros and cons. Pros: \u2022 Rooms. Clean, large, with dark wood floors, large closets and marble bathrooms with shower/tub combos and bidet. \u2022 1 block over from the Gran Via and one block up from the Plaza Espana. Easy walk to shops, park and sightseeing. \u2022 Relatively friendly staff, free internet in the lobby, relatively large rooms compared to American standards \u2022 Next door to a police station \u2022 Great for couples or singles (read on to the cons to learn why) Cons: \u2022 1 block up from several topless bars - though I must say we never saw anything untoward and they were relatively low key. \u2022 Air Conditioning. We moved from one room to another ( which was across from the elevator banks) because the AC didn't work. In the second room it did, but was weak. The staff were amenable and moved us immediately when we requested the move at 12AM. \u2022 Views. But then again, you're not living there, right? It didn't bother us because we went out to see the city every day and the view of the alley really didn't matter when we got back - we were so exhausted from moving and shaking that we were asleep before our heads hit the pillow. Other \u2022 On a small side street. I don't really count this as a con because it's Europe and everything is on a small side street. But if you are driving, know that there are cars parked on both sides of the street and maneuvering into the garage is not easy. I think the garage is also separate from the hotel and costs per day. \u2022 No peephole or chain on room doors. There is a safe and a regular deadbolt. Make sure you do lock your door and you'll be OK (kinda common sense, right? And they are NEXT DOOR to a police station) But housekeeping did try to enter when we first got in and I forgot to deadbolt our door. \u2022 Communication. I spoke much more Spanish than my boyfriend and was often the translator. The front desk speaks OK English but will always start (and possibly) in Spanish, even if they know you don't speak it. Housekeeping knows little English. Carry a pocket translator and you'll be fine - we worked it out, so can you! Overall, great stay at a small hotel.

Two complaints later, nothing was done so I had to spend the first night there. I was finally moved to a THIRD room the following day - which also smelt of sewage. Oh, and the hotel is 30yds from a huge building site. PS: Did I mention the rooms reek of sewage?

I would say about this hotel the staff is friendly, its very clean, but location is the most important thing. We had a double room in the newer part of the hotel and it was fine for what we paid for, Yes its not the ritz or a high class hotel but in Madrid hotels are very expensive so I think you cant expect a luxury hotel in a very centric area for about 90 dolars. So yes its a bit smelly, they do have air conditioning/heat, the rooms are big by european standards, and very clean, the bathrooms OK no big deal there, the elevators yes a bit old and the hallways a bit narrow but all in all I liked my stay in the coloso and would go back again.

The welcome we received, quality of reception, and the quality of the room were above average. The room (4th floor, back) was large, modern and clean, with almost silent air conditioning. Buffet breakfast was good and priced at just under \u00a310 so average for a 4* hotel. Location is excellent with just a short stroll to theatres, art galleries, shops, monuments etc. The only downside was that we booked an airport taxi to come home and this was overpriced by about 10 Euro's so our advice is to flag one down outside the hotel and save the money.

They also left us bathrobes and slippers. In the morning, my girlfriend took a shower and was going to use the bathrobe and noticed several bugs crawling on them, we threw them out of the room and into the laundry cart. We figured the place is old and where they store the robes may have a few bugs. That night our skin was itching, we blamed it on the weather, it was quite cold in Madrid that week. The other couple confirmed the same itchy feeling at night. The last night of our stay, my girlfriend woke in the middle of the night itching, turned on the lights right away and there they were, bed bugs!! The mattress was infested, we lifted it and saw more underneath, some were even in the pillow. We were disgusted and couldn't wait to leave for our next destination.

Overall, most of the reviews are accurate, although people seem to focus on the good or bad aspects only, when it in fact has many good and bad points. Our room was in the \"older\" section of the hotel (it occupies two buildings, only connected by one hallway), which looks a little run-down in the hallways and has very small and somewhat rickety elevators. The rooms are quite nice, however, and in decent shape. Our original room was on the 5th floor up on the back side, and we could hear some very loud construction noises during the daytime. Worse, the air conditioning fan did not work, so it became very warm. I complained to the front desk, who set up a maintenace person to look at it, but they could not fix it. We slept there one night and complained again the next day as the inside temperature was above 80 F, at which point we were moved to a 4th floor room on the front (street) side, which was bigger (especially the bathroom) and had functional A/C. From that point on, the stay was fine save for some minor annoyances, such as the room featuring two twin beds rather than a king-size, which seems to be common among European hotels. This hotel is on a dubious-looking street, but we did not experience and incidence of theft or other problems. It is convienent to the metro stations (two of them) as well as many of the historic sights such as the Palacio Real. Overall, it was a good place to stay for the money (about $75 US a night) and served us well.
