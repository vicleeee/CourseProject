It took them four days to change the room after no one came to look at the air conditioning unit during this time. The room was immediately given to someone else after my parents had moved out of it. The room my parents were allocated was a similar size and standard. In this room the drains were very smelly and the refrigerator didn't work. As they required to keep medication chilled this was particularly inconvenient. We complained again and they were moved to \"the best room in the hotel\". This room was in the main hotel and was still basic but it was an improvement on the previous rooms. For the price we paid the standard in the main hotel was fine but if you are allocated rooms in the other building they are substandard! The rooms in the building outside the main hotel are also very noisy, the doors are paper thin and the main power tripped a few times during our stay so no one had any air conditioning or lights! Another point to note is there are no tea or making facilities in the rooms or available anywhere else in the hotel. They advertise having a bar but it was closed for our entire stay (8nights). The location is good and there are some nice restaurants a short walk away from the hotel. It is also quite close to a metro station and not too far a walk from the colosseum.

We certainly did not find the hotel or the area anything like as bad as the previous travellers reported. First of all the area of Santa Croce is fine. We saw one homeless person sleeping in a doorway in the area. (Try going to London if you want to see some real in-your-face hardship and homelessness in the city ). There were no marauders or drug-addicts or hooligans anywhere in the area., which the previous reveiws seem to suggest. We walked at night very safely back and forth from the Manzoni Metro (which again is perfectly safe. At times it gets crowded, but as a tourist you can easily avoid the rush-hour). There are half a dozen different types of eating places within sight of the hotel, a pizzeria, a trattoria, a ristorante (glamourous and expensive) a fast-food pizza place and a Japanese restaurant. How much choice did these people want? The pizzeria was a very friendly family-run place which had an extensive menu and not just pizzas of course. If you really can not manage a single word of Italian, there is a buffet for the antipasti (starters) and if you need to you can just point to what you want to eat. A slightly further walk takes you to a fabulous 'osteria' which also had an extensive menu and lovely, country-style food. There are 'green' areas around, just outside the hotel is part of the historic wall of old Rome and if you follow that along you will come to a convenient bus terminus at Porta Maggiore. The gateway is also historic and interesting. You just have to take the blinkers off and appreciate what you are seeing. At the end of the road is the church of Santa Croce and a little further on the beautiful church of San Giovanne in Laterano; even for the non-religious these are amazing buildings to visit. The room we had was average to good as compared with similar rooms in European hotels. The bathroom was small, but contained all facilities, and an excellent shower. Towels (three each) were changed every day. The room was cosy and there may be an issue with air-conditioning in the summer (we certainly didn't need it as the weather in May was unseasonably cold). There was a secure room available with safety deposit boxes and our luggage was stored here when we checked out, until the transfer taxi arrived. The breakfast which has received so many complaints in other reviews was absolutely fine. Again, easily comparable with European breakfasts. Cereal, fresh fruit, fruit salad, bread rolls, cheeses, cold meats, tomatoes, boiled eggs, pastries, croissants fruit juices, coffees etc etc. If you expect and want a fried English breakfast, then stay in the UK. The staff at reception were business-like and helped when they could. Most speak English, one gentleman spoke very good English and was helpful in respect of aranging the safe, and checking we were OK for the transfer etc. Try some politeness and a few friendly words of Italian. Buongiorno, or Buona sera and a smile will work wonders. Overall this was a three-star hotel with three-star standards in a convenient and quiet location.

We weren't sure of the area or where to look for other accommodation so we booked the room. The following morning, a minor miracle occurred (after all, we were in the Eternal City) and our booking was found.

The hotel is said to be a 3-star-one but I think 2 stars would be more correct. The rooms we had were very small, but clean, with relativly new bathroom furnitures and a really good matraze in the double-bed. We decided to stay there instead of our actually booked hotel after having seen the rooms because we just had a 2-nights-trip and would not want to argue about where to stay with such limited time in Rome. Well, I must say that we had a quite good night (except for the noise from the streets outside of course) in our room and really were surprised by the very well sorted breakfast buffet the next morning. The guys at the reception were quite nice and friendly. The shower worked perfect. If they would invest a bit of money and time in remodeling the whole place this really would be a good offer to stay. But if not, I fear that within one or two years it would not be a pleasure in any way to stay there. The restaurants we had found around the hotel really were great and compared to the prices we had to pay nearer to the centre with all the tourist spots the dinners we had really were reasonably prized and very good. It is quite a way from the Termini Station to walk so I would recommend to use the bus which is passing right outside the hotel to bring you for just an Euro (buy it in advance at a Tabbacchi) to and from the Station to the hotel. The neighbourhood around is ok, nothing to fear about, even at dinner-times. We never felt afraid there. The pedestrian pavement of course is very tricky to walk at because the Romans do not care in any case about their dogs making a mess just anywhere you are stepping to. So, never walk there without watching where you are stepping to!", "Date": "April 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancashire, UK", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, poor location\u201d", "Author": "hottogouk", "ReviewID": "UR6482062", "Content": "Hotel Bled has a nice atmosphere yet is let down by its location.

The room was on the top floor, in the turret, with an incredible view that overlooked the area on almost all sides. We could open the windows and sit on the sill and drink cocktails while watching the city below. The downside of the room is that the elevator didn\u2019t go all the way to the top. We had to drag our luggage up a flight of steps, and when we opened the hotel room door, we were looking up another flight of steps. It was definitely worth the effort, but would be challenging for anyone with disabilities. The hotel is located in a real neighborhood, where you can actually hear people speaking Italian, which is rare in Rome. Not far from the hotel is a grocery store where you can get the most fabulous food and wine. As for the other reviews, I never saw bugs and never needed the air conditioner in September. Tip: If there are two or more of you traveling, forget the train to Termini from the airport. It will cost you as much if you just take a cab from the airport.
