Really clean and organized, has a simple but tasty breakfast, always served by smilly and really nice people. The room has nothing fancy but it's functional, clean and comfortable. Good working and easy free Wi Fi internet. Sounds like 'yeah, it's the minimum a hotel should have' but we all know it's not like this and it's really good in this hotel. All the receptionists I met there were extremely polite, always ready to help with any kind of information or service. The hotel is located in a very calm and friendly neighborhood with fast access to bus or metro that will take you anywhere you need really easy. Besides you can go walking to Camp Nou watch a Barcelona football match!!

But in hot weather and when you dont want to be amongst the huge numbers of Tourists the location is pretty cool. Some nice places to eat nearby and pretty chilled. It takes about 10mins to get to Plaza Catalunya. Room was small and ok for the price. Service in the hotel slightly unfriendly and basically a bit unreliable. They dont do things when they say they will do them. Nothing is included in the price I paid and getting a shirt Ironed costs 6euros which is laughable really. Breakfast 7euro which by hotel standards is ok.

After searching online for directions we were expecting a 30 minute commute into Barcelona centre. However we were pleasantly suprised to find the hotel just a few minutes walk away from tres torres underground which takes you straight to the top of the Rambla in ten minutes. The rooms themself were nothing fantastic but pleasant enough for a good stay. Bathrooms fully equiped with the basics including a hairdryer. The view however was not great, a small balcony overlooking privately owned apartment blocks. The beds were singles and needed to be pushed together several times during the night and the hotel guests were not the quietest with some noise during the night. We felt slightly lost the first night of our stay as we felt we were miles away from food/shops however turning right out of the hotel will soon lead to the centre of the area including lots of shops/cafes and more residential areas including a cinema and burger king. We would recommend getting a T10 card for use on the underground, they cost around 8 euros and will allow you to take 10 journeys without having to mess around getting tickets everytime. One confusion we found when purchasing the tickets was the zone information. Zone 1 is all you will need if you are going from the centre of Barcelona to the hotel. All in all we would consider this an excellent base for a Barcelona city break, it was far enough from the centre to be quite yet not too far away and was comfortable enough for our needs on a budget holiday.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thessaloniki", "Title": "\u201cOK hotel\u201d", "Author": "DespoinaThessaloniki", "ReviewID": "UR116061582", "Content": "We booked this hotel one day before we go to Barcelona so we were waiting for everything.

The worst problem was noise - not from the outside, but from other guests on our floor. In our room we could hear everything our neighbours were speaking about. The most positive about this hotel is its location, near Tres Torres metro, which provides quick access to the center. Staff was friendly and spoke english quite well.

I thought I would save a few euros trading it off with a few more stops on the metro away from the center, but I was bitterly disappointed when I came. The single room had a single twin bed and the room itself was not much bigger than the bed, topped with a small window facing an internal shaft whose curtain is permanently on, it feels like a prison cell, really claustrofobic. The room was on the 4th floor and I could hear very loudly when other doors open and close (with a bang) and when there is any movement in the corridors and perhaps also other floors. The metro is also not very convenient as the line which serves this stop comes only once every 15 min so although in theory you can reach Plaza Catalunia in 10 min, in practice it can take over 30 min. It's a residential zone, supposedly the expensive one in town, so there is nothing to do around and it really feels very out of the way.
