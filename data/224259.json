Off the bedroom area is the bathroom. Between the bathroom & bedroom was a countertop with a sink. We didn't use this second sink much, but I guess it's a good use of space?

I had an unexpected suite--a nice living room with couch, chair, tv and wet bar, and a separate bedroom with two more chairs and an additional t.v. across the large room from the king size bed. The room was quiet, spacious, and perfectly adequate. Since I was paying a conference rate, I couldn't complain, but I certainly wouldn't pay luxury rates for this hotel. I've never been to Indy before so I have nothing to compare it to, but the decor was dated and in sad need of an update/upgrade. The first night when I tried to open the desk drawer, the drawer panel fell off in my lap. The yellow striped wall paper reminds me of my mother's 1970s kitchen. The location seems reasonable enough. Within walking distance are the canal, the mall, and the war memorials. Since I was only here for a conference in the hotel, it's hard to tell whether this would be a good location for other events, but it appears that the major sporting arenas might be within a short walk. Now for the bad. The worst thing about the room was perfectly lousy maid service. The maids didn't arrive until mid morning or afternoon. Once I interrupted them about 3:30 still cleaning. But, I'm not sure if cleaning is an accurate description. I stayed for four nights and on various days I came back to towels not being replenished, soap not being replenished, a coffee cuip returned to the coffee maker without being cleaned, and towels cleaned but stained with makeup. In addition, the maid always closed the room up tight, turning off all lights and closing curtains making the room pitch-dark and rather disconcerting to a single woman travelling alone. The thermostat was raised to over 70 degrees. Furthermore, every day the alarm on the clock radio was turned off and the station turned to an awful rap station with vulgar lyrics. Instead of arriving to a comfortable room made ready for my arrival, I had to each day rearrange things the way I liked them, open the curtains, lower the thermostat, move the ice bucket back to its tray, and search for a tv remote. Pens disappeared and were not replenished. The only clock was in the bedroom. One would think that in a suite one would experience nice touches, fine amenities, fluffy towels, a robe, maybe even turn down service. None of this was apparant and the the lack of thorough cleaning during the stay was un-nerving. (Incidentally, I found the whole city rather dirty. Stores had dirty floors. Street people rested in doorways. Smells were unbelieveably unpleasant.)

This is a great location, very convenient to the convention center, shopping, downtown restaurants and Lucas Oil Stadium. Staff: The front desk staff was courteous and efficient. Check in was very easy and the staff handled a large group of elderly folks who needed a lot of extra help as quickly as they could. Staff in the 120 West Market restaurant were fine, although when I had the buffet the waiter that the maitre d\u2019 assigned me did not ask if I wanted coffee until I\u2019d almost finished eating. The restaurant was not crowded and it would have been nice to have coffee with my breakfast. Housekeeping staff was very friendly and as this was time change weekend, a lady came by on Saturday evening with new alarm clocks for every room with the time set back. I thought that was a nice touch. Facilities: The lobby of the hotel is a bit small and gets crowded very easily but it is nicely furnished. It looks like it may have been updated a few years ago and it\u2019s a little dark, but it\u2019s okay. I liked my room a lot. I had been upgraded to a suite and it was really huge. There was a couch, a wet bar with refrigerator and a flat screen tv in the living area then there was another flat screen tv and two comfortable chairs in the bedroom. The bed was very comfortable and I loved the pillows. I did not visit the pool or the gym but heard some guests in the elevator saying they were nice. Highlights: There is free wi-fi in the lobby. Also, there is a nice water cooler featuring strawberry infused water in the lobby as well as a kiosk where you can easily print out boarding passes. The elevators were great! I know that sounds like a weird thing to say but in some large hotels, you have to wait forever for the elevators (see my review of the Hilton St Louis Ballpark!). But even though the hotel was completely full, I never had to wait more than 15 seconds for an elevator and all six were working. Areas for improvement: Although the lobby has free wi-fi, internet access is wired in the guest rooms. That\u2019s not a big deal but I had a suite and would have liked if I could have taken the computer into the other room and the cable was very short. I was out from 8:00 am until around noon, then went out again around 2:00 pm until about 4:00 pm and my room had not been made up. It was after that when housekeeping came by and at that point, I just wanted to relax, so I just asked for some new towels. Would have been nicer to have my room cleaned when I was not in it for the majority of the day but not really a big issue. Some of the furniture (bureaus and night tables) looked a little dated. The heating/cooling unit in the bedroom would not turn on and off automatically. It ran all the time, either blowing warm air or cool air but it never stopped. I know this because I could feel the air blowing and it was also very loud. Also, the blackout drapes in my room were broken so they would not close all the way and left about a six inch gap, which let light from the street in during the night. Overall impression: This is a fine place to stay. I got a great deal on the rate and it was clean and comfortable. There were a few minor annoyances which I\u2019ve mentioned above, none of which ruined my stay and they were so small it wasn\u2019t even worth complaining about because I was only there two nights. However, the little details can make the difference between an average experience and an exceptional experience and although this Hilton gets most of it right, it\u2019s not as polished as other Hilton\u2019s I\u2019ve stayed at.

The staff did very well in chaotic conditions. Our room was a regular king room but had a semi-separate sitting room, and both the bedroom and sitting room had TVs. Shortly after we checked in, a manager called us just to see if we were happy with the room, which I was impressed with, especially given how busy they must have been with a full hotel. The staff at the front desk and the people we ran into in the hallways and elevators were very friendly and helpful. The only negative encounter with staff was when room service called and woke us up at 9 a.m. the morning after the championship game, when they had to know that most of the hotel had been up until the wee hours of the morning celebrating Duke's victory. They called to say that they hadn't seen a hanger on our door requesting breakfast and wanted to know if we did, in fact, want breakfast. This really annoyed me -- first because they woke me up, second because we didn't put the hanger on our door precisely because we did not want breakfast, and third because when we had ordered breakfast the day before, we asked that it not be delivered until after 10:30, so they ought to have seen that we were not early risers. Speaking of breakfast, I suggest finding somewhere else to eat it. The breakfast we got through room service was mediocre and overpriced -- something like $14 for two tiny muffins, a bowl with maybe 6 chunks of fruit, plus coffee and OJ. The other main negative at the hotel was that the bed felt unstable -- whenever my partner shifted position, the whole bed shook. Not conducive to a good night's sleep. We also periodically heard loud banging noises but couldn't tell where they were coming from. Aside from those noises, the room was fairly quiet. We were on the 19th floor and heard almost nothing from the street. Overall, I would recommend the hotel. The location is great, right in the middle of downtown Indy; the rooms are big for the price; and the staff is friendly and helpful (except when they wake you up for no reason).

The people we dealt with prior to our arrival were very accomodating and very helpful to try and make this a great event for our family. Let me start by saying this wedding was not what most would consider \"traditional\". The \"ceremony\" was very brief in one of the king suites that were reserved for the event. The rooms were HUGE so it actually work out nicely. There was about a dozen people for this part and there was plenty of room. They did a little decorating but this part wasn't that important to the bride and groom. Everything went real well with the front desk for our early check in (although communication between hotel employees could have been a little better, we kept having to tell them we were with the wedding to get things done). As a part of the package we purchased we got a bottle of champagne in the evening and breakfast. We of course weren't palnning to be in the room for the champange delivery because of the dinner and reception that evening. I asked the front desk if it would just be delivered and left in the room.and she replied \"yes\". We got back to our room that evening and the bottle had not been delivered so I called the front desk and asked that they deliver it. The person on the other end was a very rude man that actually hung up on me. We were going to sleep and had no intention of even drinking the bottle that night but because it was a part of the package we wanted it delivered. Instead of calling back I went down and luckily it was a different person and she of course apologized and seemed sincere. Before I knew it a man was walking toward me with our bottle. So I guess we got what we were entitled to but why did I get hung up on and why did I have to go get it? I know my sister-in-law (the bride) had a few issues that she wasn't real happy with that concerned customer service as well but since it wasn't my experience I am not going to write about it.

Upon arriving in my room, I sat down on the bed, looked over at a pillow, and saw a short red hair. At first I thought it was a fluke, until I looked over at another pillow, and saw another hair. Alarmed, I pulled back the sheets--and saw lots of hair. I was sick to my stomach. I shudder to think where that hair might have come from. I called the lobby, and no one answered the phone. I waited a few minutes and tried again--no answer. I immediately gathered my belongings and went down to the lobby. The lady at the front desk was very apologetic. Because there were no more single king bed rooms left, she had to put me in a double room, which was no big deal. The room was huge--probably the biggest standard hotel room I've been in. However, I was disappointed when I realized I was next to the elevator shaft. I was tired from my trip and had a lot of work to do, so I just sucked it up, which brings me to my next point--no free internet. Paying for the internet wouldn't have bothered me so much if the connection had been faster. Also, the tv needs to be upgraded badly. The hotel could also offer a lot more in the way of television channels; I've stayed at bed and breakfasts that had a better selection. I managed to sleep pretty well through the night. I was able to tune out the elevator until around 6am, presumably when more people started using it. My final disappointment--probably the biggest after the hairy bed--was the shower. The shower head needs to be replaced, because only a trickle came out, literally three holes in the shower head. Very disappointing. I know it wasn't the shower pressure because water came out of the faucet as you would expect. The highlight of my stay was breakfast. I had some delicious pancakes which were served on time. I am a Hilton Honors Club member, and when I travel for business I prefer staying at Hiltons. I can usually count on the Hilton to provide a clean room and comfortable accomodations, so I was very shocked by this hotel. Even the lobby I found to be uncharacteristically drab.

The crib we had requested was not in the room. My husband made a quick call and there was a crib delivered within minutes. It is obvious that the Hilton is an older property in Indianapolis. the decor is quite outdated. It reminded me of stepping into a lower class hotel which is not what I expected.

The parking was quite expensive, $22 for valet/$19 for self-park. However, this is not much higher than surrounding areas. There are a number of street folks in this area, and it feels a little deserted at night. If walking alone, I would recommend taking city precautions, and be aware of your surroundings. Overall, if you must stay downtown, this is a nice hotel. However, if you plan to just visit Indy, and don't need to stay downtown, there are better values elsewhere in the city.", "Date": "June 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Champaign, IL", "Title": "\u201cIt was great!\u201d", "Author": "Jakey450", "ReviewID": "UR7831065", "Content": "A great stay at this Hilton hotel!

Paid $55/nite thru priceline. Missed the entrance to self park, and had a ton of bags, so used valet. Valet is $22/nite, self park is $19, so not a huge difference. But was disappointed to find out other hotels within a block or 2 of the hilton only charge between $10-12 for self park- Radisson was $12 for self park, $18 for valet. Valet parking attendant was okay, bell man very prompt and attentive to helping unload car and bringing us to desk to check in. We switched to self park for the last 2 nights. Upon check in, we were given a room with 2 queens. We asked if we could have a king with a queen sofa. basically we were told we had the cheap rooms, and it would be an additional $51 a nite to upgrade to a king with sleeper. so we took our 2 queen bed room, and the bellman helped us upstairs to our room on the 19th floor (pool floor). upon the elevator doors opening onto the 19th floor, we were greeted by the most horrendous screaming I have ever heard. We walk over to the pool door and looked in. A large family had taken over the entire pool area, and were carrying on like it was their backyard pool party. Flips, dives, marco polo, screaming and yelling like maniacs. A small baby was floating on an inner tube in the whirlpool! Just a mess, unsafe for all involved- and no one else could possibly use the pool. I asked the bellman if there was security to deal with this. he informed me that if there was an adult present, there was nothing they could do about it. He led us to our room down the hall from the pool, where we could still clearly hear the screaming from the pool. No soundproofing at all. Were seranaded by the pool revelers until almost 11pm. Initial impression was that the room was nice, but nothing special. Basic hotel room. There was only 1 trash can in the room, and it was one of those narrow, art deco small cans that hold like 3 tissues, so most of our trash (our kids had juice boxes, toy boxes from gifts for the kids, etc) had to put placed next to the can. Room had a coffee/tea maker in the bathroom, and we used the tea bags, sugar packets, napkins, paper cups, and stirrer the first night. 2nd day, housekeeping came through, but left all the trash boxes next to the garbage can, did not replace tea packets, sugar, cups or stirrer, and left a sheled sunflower seed on the floor where there had not been one before. When I complained about the pool and bellman the morning after we arrived, the manager gave us breakfast coupons for the buffet. The food was so horrible, if I had paid I'd have demanded my money back. Eggs were undercooked, oatmeal overcooked and one large lump in the pot, poor selection of breads, and poor food presentation. Even my kids who usually love breakfast wouldn't eat any of it. Location is excellent. We could easily walk to all downtown attractions, but had to drive to zoo, speedway, and children's museum. Be aware, parking fills up quickly on game nights. We ended up taking a cab on game night, since we were afraid of moving our car and not finding a spot when we returned back. We did order room service for lunch on new yr's eve- all of which was very tasty and large portions. We ordered 2 kids' pizzas (which were large and very good), hamburgers (which were also good, and the sides with it were huge), and the homemade chips with dip (large portion and very good). The third day, the trash was still not picked up, and the tea/sugar/cups were still not replaced, so I called down asking for more tea. Someone brought up 2 tea bags, and nothing else. I've had more generous supplies at a travelodge. So as I was checking out I did mention my concerns regarding housekeeping, garbage pickup, and replenishment of supplies. Gentleman behind the counter (Jonathan) was very helpful, and took off my bill the room service and first night valet parking. So our stay was nice, just okay. I would not rate this hotel exceptional in anyway. It's about even with a hyatt.

Nice closet space with full view mirrors doors. The living area had an armoire with tv, desk area, couch and chairs. The sleeping area had an additional tv and could be closed off by the french doors. Did I mention how comfortable the bed and pillows were. I could have just relaxed the whole day. There was plenty of room to definitely spread out. I had a made to order breakfast in restaurant which was very good. Nice workout equipment and size of room. Pool and whirpool areas nice as well. Both are situated on higher floors. Self parking is $19 and I believe valet is a couple bucks more. Friendly, helpful staff. Walking distance to great restaurants, shopping and movie theatre.

We went to Indy to visit the zoo and children's museum. The Hilton is next to the state capital and monument circle at the intersection of Market and Illinois. Great location close to lots of restaurants and the Circle Centre shopping mall. We parked in the onsite garage which was $19.00 per day. The lot directly across the street on Illinois was only $12.00, but Hilton assured us they monitor their parking ramp. The hotel's bar/restaurant features $1.95 meal specials from 4-6 each evening. However, the specials are only available in the bar and no one under 21 is allowed in the bar. We were somewhat dismayed by that. Coming from the beer state, no one is turned away at a bar! We had a queen suite which was probably the largest hotel room I have ever stayed in. There were two sinks, (1 in and 1 out of bathroom) two TVs, two queen beds and a pull out sofa. There was also a nice desk/computer area for business travelers. The queen beds were separated from the sofa sleeper/desk area by french doors. The bathroom was very large. The queen beds each had 4 pillows. The weird thing was there was only 1 waste basket in the whole room. I would of expected at least 3. The kids liked the pool & hot tub. It is located on the top (19th floor). There is also a nice work out room on the 18th floor. We walked every night to Monument Circle and got ice cream at the Chocolate Cafe/South Bend Chocolate store. The steps of the monument are a great place to rest and people watch. Over the weekend it was packed. There is also an interesting FREE Civil War museum but it is closed on Mon and Tues. We ate breakfast every morning at Le Peeps, an Indy landmark. There are several locations throughout the City. The restaurant is just north of the Hilton on Illinois. Our best dinner was at Buca di Beppo almost directly across the street from Hilton on Illinois. It is a fun restaurant that is very family friendly. Their meals are served family style. I would not hesitate to go back again. The Children's museum is fantastic, well worth the trip. The zoo was also fun and has a dolphin show. The canal is a fun place to people watch as well. There are several places of interest at the White River State Park. It is where the zoo is located.", "Date": "July 25, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hilton Indianapolis", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g37209-d224259-Reviews-Hilton_Indianapolis-Indianapolis_Indiana.html", "Price": "$124 - $302*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">120 West Market Street,</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Indianapolis</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IN</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">46204</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "224259", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/32/e9/32e935b509c023543ef09afdfbe048771large.jpg"}}
