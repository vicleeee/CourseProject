This hotel was at the edge of Berlin and was a good 30 to 40 min taxi ride from the city centre. The service was OK but the rooms, that was a different story. The room was very run down and dirty. Stains on the chair; mini ancient TV; the mini fridge was actually missing; Rusty old showers; and the folder that contains information about the hotel was actually empty. The only marginally redeeming thing about this hotel is that it is right across from a S-Bahn Station and semi close to the Olympic Stadium. Would not stay here again even if it was free.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cNever again...\u201d", "Author": "Mehmetbugra", "ReviewID": "UR117291055", "Content": "We stayed there two nights. There is only one positive thing about this hotel ; across the street there was a train station, so we could go to the city center easily. ( but it takes 25-30 minutes) Most of the rooms have a nice view but not spacious and unfortunately not clean enough. Also they need a serious refurbishment! We had terrible breakfasts for two days. The restaurant was closed for two days and you have to go out for dinner. No room service after 11:00. Even you can not find a glass of hot water. And the most important thing; They dont have any idea about \"service business\". They were like a soldiers. No smile, no kindness, just doing their simple tasks... If you are having a vacation, strongly avoid this hotel.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it and we'll be back\u201d", "Author": "johnbentley8", "ReviewID": "UR114751753", "Content": "Booked though Flight Centre in London. Was excellent value. The hotel is directly opposite the s-bahn station and whilst being several stations from the Hauptbahnhof we found it a pleasant ride in-off peak times. It is an easy walk to Standau. The old Standau is a delight. The new Standau is as you would expect anything new to be. As for the visitor complaining that he couldn't find a pub to have a beer, he must have missed the one on the corner about 100 metres from the hotel with a delightful (non English speaking) host. The room was more than satisfactory and we found the breakfast quite adequate considering it was included in the more-than-satisfactory tariff", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wigan", "Title": "\u201cPerfect out of town location\u201d", "Author": "Spandaubailey", "ReviewID": "UR114738359", "Content": "The Senator might seem too far from the attractions of the city for a stay in Berlin but it is served by the S-Bahn immediately outside the hotel to anywhere you want to go. I stayed on the 13th floor overlooking Stresow S-Bahn station and had no problem with noise as some people have mentioned. The 16th floor is the restaurant with a panoramic wonderful view of Spandau and beyond. Staff were helpful and friendly with some English spoken and they were patient with my attempts at German! The old medieval town of Spandau and the ancient Zitadelle are a short walk away and well worth a visit.

The hotel has ok lobby service and very good restaurant. We were there for a working/sight seeing trip. In the cold of the winter, the room was nice, very clean and warm. Seems like a new hotel to us, or may be it was renovated. What we really liked was the breakfast. Better than what we expected, actually, it was very good with good service. Only complaint maybe that it is a good 30 minutes from the main shopping street by train (cost only 2.6euros). But this is not really a problem for me as I travel a lot in Europe and best way to save is to get a hotel that is a bit far away. If you have more budget, then getting a downtown hotel would be better.", "Date": "December 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "thessaloniki", "Title": "\u201cNice But Nothing More\u201d", "Author": "oupsss", "ReviewID": "UR13172936", "Content": "Nice hotel.
