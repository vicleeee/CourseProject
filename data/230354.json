{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Avoid this hotel I was staying in this hotel during a fair in Frankfurt in April 2007.I paid 100 \u9227?per room/night. I was surprised when i arrived to the hotel. This hotel is not even a one star hotel. Very bad quality of service. Rooms are really small and old. It was so noisy at night that i couldn't sleep.It is mentioned in expedia that this hotel was newly refurbished which is completely wrong.Was looking around in the area and i have found better hotels for cheaper rates.My advise is to avoid booking this hotel.", "Date": "Apr 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR714476950", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "faizmimi"}, {"Content": "Prinz Otto STAY AWAY! My associates and I booked 3 rooms for 5 nights at the Prinz Otto while we were in Frankfurt for a trade fair. They charged us over 200 euros each per night each for terrible accomodations and extremely rude and unhelpful staff. I read here that their normal rate, when the trade fair is not in town is more like 42 euros. It's not worth that.Rooms were unclean, Towels and sheets etc all were threadbare and had holes in them. Radiators were plugged with dust. Stained and threadbare carpets. Hairballs in the showers that ran hot and cold, toilets that wouldn't flush, TV's that didn't work, a nauseating breakfast that none of us could eat. Bathroom tiles patched and grouted with silicone sealant. I don't believe that the rooms had fire escapes. Real low, low class. I wish I'd checked here first.After 3 nights in that dive, we were able to find much better and cheaper accomodations at a Best Western hotel. When we went to pay for our 3 nights, we were told that we had to pay for 5. We refused to sign the credit card receipt, and left. It's now in dispute. We refuse to pay for the nights we didn't stay there.", "Date": "Mar 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR864319238", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "BMontana"}, {"Content": "This place is a dive! This hotel was TERRIBLE. It was filthy, dingy, and DANGEROUS! It is NOT a place you would want to stay. I booked this through ---.com and how it got a 3 star rating was shocking, to say the least. The carpets and walls were really dirty. There was one tiny, dark, dingy lobby with one person at the front desk (from what I could gather, there was only one person working in the entire place at 4 pm). The elevator was TINY, about 9 square feet and dangerous -- the door slams shut on you, even if there is an arm or luggage in the way. One of our bags got stuck and almost got dragged up through the floors. The elevator also only stops BETWEEN FLOORS, so you still have to drag your bags up or down a very narrow and steep flight of stairs to get to your room. The rooms themselves were really, really, awful. The floors and walls were filthy. The beds looked like something they'd salvaged out of the dumpster. The TV didn't work, when I opened the door to the armoir to hang up my cloat, the entire back of it fell off. The door LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE-- my father in law locked the door to go out to make a phone call and my mother in law and my son WERE LOCKED IN and couldn't get out of the room! The doors themselves were flimsy and could have been kicked in by anyone who wanted to. The people next door were screaming and yelling in Russian to God knows who. It was the kind of place that you'd see on TV crime shows that harbored drug dealers and prostitutes. It was that bad. No one, no one should stay here. There are much cleaner and safer places to stay for less just a block away!", "Date": "Dec 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR733580894", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "myschuler"}, {"Content": "The Worst Horrible, rude staff....small cramped rooms.

I stayed at the Hotel Prinz Otto in May 2003.I found my room to be amazingly clean,including the bathroom. It is located in a superb location just a few steps away from the train station.Although when I checked in, the person on duty was not very personable. When I checked out of the hotel, the staff member was very pleasant and helpful. I also stayed there because of the Frommer's travel guide.

We were game for a challenge so we carried on. We stayed at Prinz Otto hotel for 3 nights 5.12.03-8.12.03. To our suprise we found the people very helpful and spoke more English than we did German. Granted the rooms were basic but comfortable and the shower room exceptionally clean. For the price we paid none of us had any complaints.

We we got to the room, it was absolutely filthy, the sheets had holes in them, the carpet was stained, the headboards were stained, and the bathroom was dirty. When we told the manager we wanted to cancel our reservation, he became irate. He LOCKED us in the hotel and threatened us until we paid for one night's stay, even though we hadn't used the room. We asked him to call the police  he wouldn't. We paid for the one night and are now disputing the charge through our credit card company. This was by far the worst hotel we have ever had the bad luck to encounter. The Hotel Hamburger Hof, right across the street from the Hotel Prinz Otto, was very good  they were super accomodating. Also, IBIS hotels were great.
