We did not have a breakfast option with our booking but there is a great little cafe on the corner that does a good breakfast. The cost for breakfast in the hotel is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18 which I think is quite steep. Tea and coffee is free in the bar area all day with cookies or chocolates which is a nice touch. There is no restaurant for lunch or dinner but you can order room service and the hotel uses two restaurants nearby for these meals at no extra charge. As there are plenty of restaurants nearby there is no need to eat in the hotel. The room was lovely and spotlessy clean. Staff are very friendly and will make recommendations for places to see or things to do. We came to see the Keuchenhof Gardens which are a must and the Floriade which is held every 10 years in Holland. This is good for garden enthusiasts. The Keuchenhof is definitely a place to see. Spectacular park with 7 million bulbs planted in different layouts. The colour is absolutely beautiful and the scent of flowers is everywhere.

The decore of the hotel is fantastic, beautiful chandillers, blossom trees and funky wall paper. The staff where accomodating to our needs, polite and nothing was questioned. For example i am a very light sleeper and we had a deulux room street side. I Had a bad nights sleep due to the road noise ( and the couple next door bonking at 3 am ... very noisily... please note the walls are very thin there is no need to be extra vocal!) . I informed the laduy atr the desk who imediatly changed our room, and she was even kind enough to think about where the room was so it would cause us less issues to find it, they moved all our bags for us too. Bags taken to the room on request no problem. we arrived at 0930am and our bags where safley stored until our return. I would advise if your not a good sleeper to get a room that faces the patio garden. I wanted a view but to be honest your not in your room enough to be staring at the view. We stayed in room 300 on second night which they used for a family the night before as it is definatley larger that the previous one we stayed in, 302 however it was also a great room. My husband slept like a log in both rooms. Loved the jucuzzi bath tub and walk in shower. The free coffee/ tea, biscuits, sweets are an brilliant added bonus especially when u have been on your feet all day and you can sit in the lobby on the very comfy seats and enjoy a free drink!

Two things disappointed us a little: as we did not get a room facing the canal, our room's windows faced the street behind the hotel and it was a busy and loud street (the Hotel knows that, as they supply ear plugs in the bedside drawer and encourage the guests to use it). The other thing is that just at the side of our room, neighbor to the hotel, there is a traditional Amsterdam Coffee Shop. So, one day, the windows were opened during the time we went to walk and the expected scent of Cannabis filled our room.

The Hotel has several good restaurants in the vicinity in various price ranges. The only drawback I can possibly think of is that the hotel does not provide free wifi but this had no negative effect on our break.

While the ceremony itself was at a different venue, the Estherea Hotel was the starting point for our wedding day photos, which turned out more beautiful than we could have imagined. The 'Getting Ready' photos in our large room were lovely, in particular as the wallpaper and floor carpets created a romantic, victorian-like look. After that, I came down the main stairway into the lobby where my husband greeted me with my wedding bouquet - we loved this moment itself as much as the memories that we can revive through our amazing wedding photos. Also, the bar area with the large crystal ceiling lamps, as well as the colourful glass in the foyer leading to the dining area, in particular, created beautiful backdrops for our first photos together in our wedding attire. This is simply a beautiful hotel, perfectly situated in the heart of Amsterdam, along one of the most scenic canals! What we also liked about the hotel was that they gave us a (relatively!) good price for our large canal-facing room. They did this mainly, I suspect, because they expected that we would bring in a large amount of business as our wedding guests were mostly travelling from abroad as well. However, the normal rates of this hotel are quite high, which, ultimately, lead to only one other wedding guest staying there. We could fully understand our guests' decisions to stay elsewhere, as we ourselves would also never stay in such a pricy hotel except for a once-in-a-lifetime event like our wedding. However, for those who are willing to indulge, I highly recommend this hotel! It is infinitely more endearing, romantic, and special than the large luxury hotel chains you can find in any major city. The other thing that we absolutely loved, was the breakfast buffet. It was so full of variety and tastes, that it was hard to restrain myself for the sake of fitting into my wedding dress, and -certainly- the morning after the wedding I finally took full and unrestricted advantage of this culinary experience! The only thing we thought they could slightly improve on was, in certain respects, their service. During our stay many of our family and friends who were staying in nearby hotels stopped by off and on to meet us for activities and meals in the nearby vicinity. At one occasion, a staff member confronted us saying that this created a bit of a security risk for them. We found a solution in the end, and, especially, on our wedding day, they were more than gracious about the amount of people lingering in the lobby before my arrival at the staircase. But, what we found a bit disturbing was that at two different occasions, hotel maids gave us entry into our hotel room, not verifying who we were; and this, in my opinion, is a much more grave security issue than the presence of non-guests in the lobby area. Finally, back on the positive side, I want to mention a rather small aspect that, in my opinion, gave the hotel its finishing touch. There was an adorable three-coloured cat in their hotel lobby that seemed to live there and walked around freely in the hotel area. This little, well-mannered host fit in perfectly with the ambience and the atmosphere of the place while giving it the personal touch of a Parisian-style boutique hotel: unique and artistic in every way!", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cSo Lovely\u201d", "Author": "lavitabella", "ReviewID": "UR124187065", "Content": "My family of 4 enjoyed this charming hotel in the Singel so much that we would not hesitate to recommend to friends.

The hotel also has a couple of computers which are of complimentary use. There is also a small board just next the bar which has various vouchers for discounts and deals on local attractions, restaurants etc. The rooms are of a good size and you are able to book a room with a jacuzzi which is lovely after roaming Amsterdam all day in the cold months. The room we stayed in had a good sized bathroom which included a separate walk in shower and then in the main bathroom area were his and hers sinks and as mentioned, the jacuzzi.

A very nice touch. The lobby is very attractive and there is complimentary coffee, hot chocolate and water available in the lobby at all times as well as some little candies and snacks. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel, but only because we had reservations at a local cafe. The hotel is in a very nice location and is along a very nice canal and close to the \"9 little streets\" which is a nice shopping area. Also close to Kalverstraat. It was slightly noisy in our room with the street below and we could hear the neighboring room in the morning, but they did offer complimentary earplugs at the front desk.

With no window it was a bit like being on board a ship. Would have preferred a bath screen rather than a shower curtain, but just personal preference. Breakfast was outstanding.

These upgraded canal-view rooms had more than enough space. The bathroom was on the small side, but still plenty of room to shower and such. Our rooms had a tub/shower combo, single sink, and commode. The doors are louvered, not solid. Our bed was indded a king. Mother's was 2 twins pushed together; but she was a single so it didn't matter. The heavy, interlined draperies help to deaden the noise from outside. But they also cover the heat registers. You may want to lift a few panels up onto tops of the wooden radiator covers to keep the heat in the room. This hotel has been updated and modernized, but it is still an old soul at heart. The floors in the halls creak...GASP! And the walls are not super insulated from sound. If that's the type of hotel you are looking for, stay at the Hilton. The doors are locked at 11pm. You simply buzz the intercom and the desk clerk will let you in. We never had a problem with this. The hot beverage bar and sweet treats were also a nice touch.

It does not work for one person and more importantly for a couple who want to sleep together. In addition there was not a single comfortable chair to sit in and read. 3 wooden chairs and incongrous wooden table in the middle of the room were the extent of the furnishings. In short the room was not comfortable at all. I have had smaller rooms with more comfort. Housekeeping is very very slow. Two times it took over 5 hours from putting the sign on the door to the room finally being ready. After it is ready there is a constant interruption as various supervisors come to check if the room has been cleaned.. too little, too much. Bathroom was OK but the shower is treacherous if one is not steady and god forbid you turn the wrong faucet. Front desk staff are either very friendly and helpful or imperious. A bizarre acrid stink in the lift needs tending to. The lobby is pleasant and warm with many chandeliers, lots of interesting small touches but not to everyone's taste.

Breakfast was included in our room rate. The coffee machines int he breakfast room were great and the same machine was available just off the lobby 24 hours a day. Free internet is also available in the lobby and they have two computers for people traveling without one. I spoke to a couple who had a much larger room on an outside wall overlooking the canal and they were very happy with it.

The bed mattress, pillows and feather bed were amazingly soft. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best hotel bed I ever slept in. The bathroom had a jacuzzi bathtub, a shower, two sinks, hair dryer, shampoos, towels, washcloths, make-up mirror, Kleenex tissues and even cotton wools and cotton buds! In the bedroom there was a minibar, safe, closet and ironing board. We had a writing desk and a table + two chairs at the window. We didn't use the flatscreen tv or the airco (too chilly). There is no free wifi in the room, nor are there tea making facilities, but both can be found downstairs. Besides the living room there is a library, bar and a corner with two computers (free internet). We often found ourselves sitting in the living room, at all times of the day. And we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only ones! Many people sit here, enjoying the sumptuous decorations and the warm feeling the common areas exude. I loved the large soft chair (it easily fits two people), I curled up here to read while my colleague was soaking in the jacuzzi. There are newspapers in several languages available at the reception and the library is, duh, filled with books that guests can use. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very easy to start a conversation with other hotel guests. This inviting hotel is like a second home and at the end of the day I looked forward to returning to Esther\u00c3\u00a9a every time. They even have a hotel cat, called Hegje. She was saved from the animal shelter and now lives in the hotel. She has her own place to sleep but when its calm you can find her walking around in the common area or sleeping in one of the chairs. Hegje isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only animal in the hotel, the lobby has a very beautiful aquarium as well. You can also find a gym and a public telephone in the hotel. There are two lifts, but you can take the stairs if you like. The hotel also provides free umbrellas and ponchos when it rains. You can rent a Vespa scooter or order a taxi. Personally I find walking around the best way to discover the city, since the hotel is located inside the city center. We walked from the Central Station to our hotel in about 20 minutes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very easy to find. All of the museums we visited were within walking distance. All staff are incredibly kind and knowledgeable about the city. There is always at least one person at the reception and usually there is also someone walking around the common area. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have breakfast in the hotel (price is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 16 per person). There is a small bakery (Lanskroon, Singel 385) two minutes walking away. So we bought something there and came back to the hotel to have breakfast in the living room. Some other people did this as well. The only downside was that we woke up during the night a couple of times and early in the morning, because Spuistraat is apparently a busy road and the house right in front of our window was being renovated. The construction workers started at 7.30 a.m. but of course the hotel can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything about this, so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really bother me for those two nights. Overall: * good location on Singel overlooking a canal, and within walking distance of Central Station and most important highlights * splendid and comfortable room * helpful, attentive, agreeable and polite staff * luggage was already in our room when we first entered our room = great service * beautiful and cozy common areas, like living room and library, where you can just sit and relax * free coffee, tea, hot chocolate, cakes and candy all day long in the common area If I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ever go back to Amsterdam I will most definitely return to Hotel Esther\u00c3\u00a9a, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want any other hotel than this one.

Loved all the things that the other reviewers have said about the hotel - check-in - friendly and warm - the girls at reception were lovely and so helpful room - quiet and had everything I needed, absolutely spotlessly clean and no-smoking throughout. The room faced the other block of rooms, but this means they are the quietest. Ask for the 2nd or the first floor - they are quietest. free hot chocolate, the use of the computers in the lobby (free), the beautifully kept fish tank, beautiful lights, florals, made the hotel really special.

Close by, a) the Nine Streets shopping - do not miss La Savonniere b) Brootje Bert - irresistible burgers c) Kantil and Tiger for a reasonable rijstaffel dinner Best restaurant (make reservations early) was Tempo Doloe - don't miss this one. Everything was delicious and they make excellent cocktails too!

The breakfast staff was eager to customize their menu for our allergy/health requirements and even remembered us the next morning with same dishes. No need to have lunch during the day after this sumptuous buffet in the morning. As for the rooms, we did get a king bed as we reserved (2 twins made-up together). Be aware that you must leave your room key at the front desk each time you leave the hotel. The decor of the bedroom was beautiful, soothing and comfortable. The bed was heavenly - wish I had one at home! The blackout curtains were really blackout - which we needed to get onto the time change. HOWEVER, we had packed luggage for a 12 day cruise, and there was absolutely no room in the room to open the luggage. It was typically European tiny. We had to stack the bags. So if you are planning this as a layover for your cruise, be sure to plan one small bag with all you need for those days and ask to leave the other pieces in their luggage room. The bathroom was impeccable - looked very new and the towels were bigger than most hotels...seriously- my husband is a big guy, and he had no complaints about the bath towel after his shower. Dryer, lotion, shampoo, body soap, shower cap all included in the bathroom kit. This location in the Jordaan District was an easy jump-off point to everything, once you get the hang of the canals and the tram stops.

The only inconvenience was the size of the bathroom, which was very small. The quality of breakfast (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac16 per adult, children do not pay) was superb. Even the cappuccino was very good - a rare treat. They charge customers \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 for wifi (24 hours) - worked very well. For those who do not need wifi, there are 2 complementary PCs.

I cannot imagine why it is not rated even higher. First of all, it is in simply the nicest location in Amsterdam, on the beautiful Singel canal, close to everything. From the moment we arrived, exhausted with jet lag, we felt welcomed and pampered by the young, attractive staff. The place is like a gracious, elegant home to return to each day after your adventures in the city. It's idiosyncrasies, like the magnificent tropical aquariums, gilded grandfather clocks, period wallpapers and rich woodwork give it a unique style among the many hotels we have stayed at in many places. There is nothing else quite like it, anywhere, unfortunately, for travellers seeking good taste and comfort. The hospitality is exemplified by the generous goodies available in the lobby all day and evening, coffees, teas, hot chocolate, cookies, cakes and chocolate goodies. This week it was Easter themed, so there were assorted sugar cookie ducks and bunnies and Easter baskets in the room. The breakfast was also outstanding. I can't imagine what some previous complainers could possibly have wanted in addition to this ample buffet. We were able to enjoy it, and free internet, for only 8E per person thanks to a special Trip Advisor promotion which appeared after we booked, but was graciously applied to our reservation. Although our room did not face the canal, we had a gorgeous design with lots of space, sitting area and a magnificent bathroom, double sinks and a huge jacuzzi tub. The decor is original to Amsterdam. The incredible wallpaper patterns seen around the hotel were reminiscent of those we saw on the walls at the Riejksmuseum under the Rembrandts! The bed was fantastic, the sheets the finest. Amenities, first class. The employees were extremely helpful in all respects. They helped us arrange tickets to Kukenhof, a must-see at this time of year, and other sights around the city and the fixed rate taxi to the airport, which is actually only a few Euros more than the shuttle and a lot more direct and timesaving. To me, the mark of a good hotel is the feeling I get that I wish I never had to leave. Can you imagine being sorry to have to travel on to Paris?

However, the first night we were laying in bed, the people above us came into their room and I honestly thought the chandelier was going to fall right down onto my son's cot. I understand the building is very old, but the shaking of the ceiling above us and the chandelier was unbelievably loud. I could have sworn there were elephants up there, unless the people were always stomping around and mad! I will mention that my in-laws were on the trip with us and did NOT have similar complaints with their room. On a different note, the hotel staff was friendly but completely clueless when it came to helping out with questions about the local area. I asked one morning for a place nearby for breakfast; it took two members of staff and about five minutes before they came to the conclusion that nothing close by was open. The night prior, I had been asking about a tour that they offered to Keukenhof and the man could not tell me anything beyond what was listed in the brochure. I ended up booking the tour and double checked to make sure of the pick up time; when I got to the tour office I was informed that the hotel had given me incorrect information and that I would need to come back in three more hours for my tour to begin at that time. So....to sum it up, the hotel was beautiful, it was a great location, but our room was a little uncomfortable due to the loud ceiling and the hotel staff was, well....clueless.

The bathroom was large with good working shower and sink and ample supply of soap, champoo etc. All aspects of the room were in great shape without any scratches, stains, etc. The bed was comfortable with good quality cotton sheets. Breakfast was ample with a great variety of cold and hot dishes, fruits, breads, drinks, etc and the setting, perhaps not everyones taste, was nice and clean with very good service. The reception staff is eager to provide guidance and to help where necessary and bikes and scooters can be rented. Wifi worked well for me and there are 2 computers near the reception area.

Hotel Estherea has old-world charm with all the modern comforts, i.e. two free internet computer terminals in the lounge, two elevators, comfortable HVAC and a delightful hot beverage dispenser with free hot chocolate, latte, coffee mocha, etc. This \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcboutique hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has its original plush ambiance from its former canal-side homes. Wondering through the library, salon and sitting rooms is as if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re visiting one of these grand homes. The hotel is near Dam Square, tourist sites and a 15-minute walk from the train station. We booked (well-in-advance) two double/twin classic rooms directly from the hotel website, which states that each room has its own unique character. The four of us agreed that we did not enjoy ours. Since our three-day stay was right before New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (Dec. 27-30), we paid the holiday rate of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac125, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac135 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac155 per room. One room was on ground level and the other was directly above. At check-in, we asked for rooms on the same floor. Staff said that the hotel was fully booked and our rooms were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca special rate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (not according to their website)! Our rooms faced a small courtyard walled-in by the surrounding rooms, maybe two across....so the courtyard was only a few meters wide. The building was about five stories high, which made these lower floor rooms dark and claustrophobic. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s similar to rooms located in the bottom of a well! An interesting note: at checkout, staff said that the post-Christmas snowstorm caused many cancellations. Room Pro: Kudos to the housekeeping staff\u00e2\u20ac\u201dboth rooms were very clean, visually pleasing with old-world charm, comfortable beds and pillows, warm bedding and fully equipped bathrooms. A good money-saving tip is to prepay breakfast (by email) for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12 instead of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac16 pp, per-day. The breakfast buffet included a wide assortment of good tasting food, such as scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, cheeses, deli meats, breads and rolls, cereal, fresh fruit, yogurt and toppings, etc. Hotel staff was courteous but do not expect them to act as concierges. Do your research in advance regarding restaurants. On our first night and still jet lagged, we asked for their dining recommendations. They referred us to the street behind the hotel. The following night, we asked for a restaurant specializing in local cuisine and they sent us to the hotel directory. They are helpful with walking directions. Room Con: Even for European standards, both rooms were small (especially considering the price). There was barely enough space to maneuver around the furniture and our 2-pieces of luggage. Our rooms were located near the stairs, so early in the morning you could hear luggage bouncing down them. In all, we liked this hotel. Our suggestion is to contact the Hotel Estherea regarding room selection and ask for one on the upper floors and away from the stairs.", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for a beautiful hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Edinburgh_Lady", "ReviewID": "UR97967969", "Content": "My husband and I were looking for a hotel in Amsterdam that was central yet quiet, and having read some good reviews about the Hotel Estherea on Trip Advisor, thought we would give it a go.

We got the last room available when we booked, however, it was absolutely stunning. The decor was lovely and the bathroom was immaculate (with a jacuzzi bath and separate wet floor shower). The bed was exceptionally comfortable too. The only down side about our room is that there was an adjoining room, so there was a fair amount of noise came through (not a major problem, but if you are a light sleeper, it would have been quite annoying!). The public areas are really lovely too, and the free coffee, hot chocolate and teas available in the lobby (that many other travellers have also mentioned) were very welcome indeed!

Strolling through this unique city , visiting their wonderful museums and interesting sights and to return to the welcoming lobby of The Estherea made our New Year a very special one.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "reviewerIOW", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely perfect!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "reviewerIOW", "ReviewID": "UR91758220", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel with my aunt for 2 nights in December having spent quite literally about a month searching through possible hotels in Amsterdam. Having spent so long searching, and becoming increasingly concerned about the lack of anywhere good to stay, I stumbled across the hotel Estherea. I dedided to email the hotel directly to get a feel for their customer service and they were excellent. They responded to me within a few minutes and were extremely helpful and informative. The price they offered was as good as any I had found online, but they did have a set price for breakfast which I happened to find cheaper on another website, so I thanked them for their time and explained that I would be booking to stay with them, but through another company. They remained extremely pleasant and commented that they looked forward seeing us on arrival. On arrival, we did get a bit lost in all the chaos of amsterdam and were brave (or stupid) and jumped on a tram which we hoped would take us to very near the hotel. The tram infact only took seconds and we were off again and lost in the very cold evening. We asked several locals where the Estherea was but they did not seem to know. Eventually we were saved by the directions from a shop owner and we found the hotel within minutes. My advice, if you are arriving at night or when its cold, is to treat yourself to a cab, it cost 7euros from the hotel to the station when we went home so really not much for the comfort as a one off! Anyway, having been so put off Amsterdam hotels after the massive search, we were dubious as we walked along the canal side to our hotel, but as we saw a hotel sign in the distance and spotted our hotel we were hugely impressed! It was beautifully decorated outside and the inside was absolutely stunning. The reception staff were really welcoming and asked if a double room was ok. I explained we had requested a twin room on the booking form and they said no problem. So after a quick check in we were escorted to our room by a lovely man who took all our bags. We went in the lift up to our room (there are 2 lovely lifts in the hotel, all opulent and gold, and I am pointing this out as I have seen from many hotel reviews that lifts seem to be a luxury in amsterdam but do not worry, you get 2 here!!!) and it was absolutely lovely. The room was really warm with 2radiators which we could control, plus air con if we needed it. We had a flat screen tv with built in radio, a very clean bathroom with nice complimentary toiletries and decent loo roll (!!!), complimentary slippers and a free bottle of water each. The beds were really comfy and were clearly expensive, with really nice bounce back style pillows and decent duvets (and spare pillows in the wardrobe). We had a posh sofa and a giant armchair in the room, a hairdryer in the bathroom, plus plenty of towels and a flannel each and we even had seperate sinks! The windows opened up so we could get fresh air into the room. The hotel is non smoking so the room smelt very clean and everything was spotless. We just couldnt believe our luck as we had been so worried about what the hotel may be like. We had no need to worry, the hotel Estherea was absolutely perfect, we had truly landed on our feet. Infact we couldnt understand what stopped it being a 5 star? Many people had commented that the breakfast wasnt great so here is what I thought. I am a vegetarian and don't eat egg, so if anything, I though I would struggle to find much variety. I was wrong. The things I could eat and drink included fresh fruit smoothies, fruit juices, all types of hot drinks including many different types of tea in silk style tea bags, let alone anything else!!! Individually sealed packets of cereal, fruits to add such as raisins and prunes, toast, breads, croissants, cake, fresh fruit mix which included all sorts of lovely things such as pineapple and grapes and kiwi (the pineapple was even cut properly so there were no stalk bits in it!!!), small bunches of grapes, precut kiwi fruits, pre cut oranges, jams, various spreads such as chocolate and pate, a selection of cheeses, whole fruit such as apples and satsumas, health drinks like actimel, and I am sure loads more, I just cant remember right now!!! In addition to this, for meat/egg eaters I saw mixed cold meats, hard boiled eggs, scrambled and fried eggs and bacon. Even a fatty would be satisfied with what was on offer!!! I fail to see how anyone could complain about it! The hotel lobby style area has several rooms in which guests could relax and every chair we sat in was comfortable. To make this experience even more enjoyable, there are free hot drinks, sweets and biscuits available at all times and they never ran out. It was such a nice thing to have and we definately made the most of it, the sugary covered biscuits have to be tried, you will be hooked!!! And the toffees are yummy too, I even took some for the plane home!!! You feel very comfortable wherever you choose to relax in the hotel, and they have a bar if you want some alcohol (at a charge). They have 2 computers in the lounge areas and they are really quick. I was able to go on them as and when I wanted and didn't have to wait, or have anyone pressure me to hurry up. Maybe this is different at other times of the year? But it wasn't important to me, I just went on to boast about how great the hotel was to friends back at home! I think for a charge you can get wifi in the rooms. The reception staff were always ready with a smile when we needed to ask them things and were happy to direct us to places and also gave us a map to help, They also called a taxi which arrived within 5 minutes of the call, everything was so efficient! On the day we checked out (very sad!) the reception happily took all of our cases and securely locked them away with individual tags and gave us a receipt to collect them with. This was free of charge. When we got back to the hotel after our last day we had officially checked out, yet we felt comfortable to continue enjoying the hotels facilities and as we had about an hour before we had to leave we relaxed on the big round chair and had some hot chocolate and biscuits. I think any other hotel would have told us to leave, but the Estherea did not bat an eyelid and we felt as welcome as we had from the moment we arrived. Just to add, the hotel does have a gym but we did not use it so i cannot comment on it, other than to say it looked nice and clean through the windows, wasn't huge, but would be fine for a basic workout. I feel like there are a million more things I want to say about this absolutely brilliant hotel, I literally cannot fault it at all. Oh and noise was minimal, this is something I worry about but had no need to here, it was extremely peaceful day and night. On a final note, the hotel cat is gorgeous, I don't know how to spell his name but it sounds like 'hechyir'!!! He is a stunner and although he seems (Or she?) a bit standoffish its not actually the case. He cannot get enough fuss and ended up sprawled out in our shopping!!! If you don't like cats (are you mad?!!!) don't worry, he doesn't bother you, you make the effort for him and then he will accept happily so please do not let this put you off an amazing place to stay. My only regret is that I couldn't bring Hechyir home with me!!!!! I hope this review has helped, have a great stay! ps-location is 5 minutes to the massive long street of shops, food places are within a few minutes and station about 10 minutes walk.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Princeton", "Title": "\u201cNew Years in Amsterdam - WOW\u201d", "Author": "3hands", "ReviewID": "UR91720146", "Content": "A lovely hotel ideally located in Amsterdam with a super friendly staff.

The location is excellent: you can go everywhere in the downtown of Amsterdam on foot and you do not need to use public transportation. We arrived at about 11pm and a very helpful receptionist welcomed us explain everything about the hotel and Amsterdam. I have to say that all the receptionists that I meet during our stay very always very friendly and helpful (to suggest a restaurant, to organize a transfer to the airport, etc.). The hotels is composed of four buildings, two of which were recently acquired by the hotel (as I read in a magazine in my room). Our rooms was in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd buildings, the rooms furniture was ok. There were however some negatives things: the bathroom need to be refurnished as soonest, the bed was a French one (160cm) not very comfortable for two people, we heard people walking in the floor above us and one night we even heard someone snoring in a room next to ours! The room size is ok (do not expect big rooms). The breakfast is ok but the breakfast room can be sometimes crowed (is better to go as earlier as you can). Next to the reception on the ground floor there is a coffee and tea machine that hotel gust can use with no charges.

In all its glory, it draws the eye of everyone who enters, commanding attention as it accentuates its prominence as the \"pi\u00c3\u00a8ce de r\u00c3\u00a9sistance\". It consists of a myriad of crystals, each small fragment beautiful and pristine on its own. However, taken altogether each of those crystals combine to become, as a whole, more brilliant and dazzling than they possibly could individually. This is my view of the Hotel Esther\u00c3\u00a9a , with its various attributes and facets, each exceptional and noteworthy in their own right, but nonetheless when put together, rises above and surpasses the average hotel experience into another dimension. The notable facets of the Esther\u00c3\u00a9a include, in no specific order: *old world charm combined with luxurious accommodations *immaculate, historic and stunning architectural canal house on the outside, fused with modern amenities, yet reflecting the lifestyles of centuries past on the inside. *pristine, central location along the first of four concentric, semicircle canals surrounding the city centre, almost everything within walking distance. *the enigmatic Dutch \"gezelligheid\" quality, the ambience which makes the hotel warm, cozy and welcoming. That indefinable element that makes a stay memorable. *romantic rooms with heavenly beds, which exceed European expectations and standards, especially the modern and chic, immaculately clean washrooms. *large, landscaped central atrium, perfect for allowing maximum natural light to filter into enormous floor to ceiling windows. *fabulous breakfast buffet to indulge in with relaxation, fortifying you each morning for an enjoyable, unforgettable experience in Amsterdam. *decadent treats and nibbles set out fresh all day, tempting you to pour yourself a complimentary tea or coffee (cappuccino, expresso, americano, etc), forcing you into lingering awhile in the plush surroundings of the lobby or the luxurious library. *refreshing mint & lemon infused water, available from the dispenser on the bar, to enjoy while waiting for one of the two computers provided, courtesy of the hotel. *stunning floral displays throughout, attention to details, including individual cloth hand towels in the lower common/public restrooms. *a gracious owner (along with her adorable daughters), who mingles and chats with the guests, ensuring the intimate, family-oriented, yet boutique atmosphere of the hotel. *exceptional service and hospitality from each and every staff member. From the bellboys, the housekeepers, the bartender, to all at the Front Desk, including those who replied to all my prior email requests promptly. But we especially want to mention Singh. No request, and there were many, was too great or too small for him. He is a top-notch professional, who bent over backwards to make our family's visit special. The only fault that could be found are the sounds that can carry between rooms, depending upon how courteous your neighbouring guests conduct themselves in the wee hours. In our travels we have experienced this occurrence in many establishments, so much so, that we don't travel without being adequately prepared with quality earplugs. Therefore this didn't affect us, but the unwary may not anticipate this, and it would be negligent not to mention. Taking all these factors into account, the well-travelled adventurer would not be disappointed in choosing the Hotel Esther\u00c3\u00a9a . It truly is a destination within a destination.

There is a 24 hour tea / coffee making facility which is great and easy access to the PC's for internet or web mail etc. The hotel is in a great location on Singel and a short stroll to the shopping and / or main centre.

Sitting in the centre of Amsterdam, in quiet neighbourhood and on the lovely Singel Canal, it is the perfect combination of location, great decor and unbeatable service. The flower market is right down the canal (a bridge or two as the say) and the Van Gogh, Rijksmuseum, Rembrandt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house, Central Station and more are within walking distance. When ever we asked how to get someplace, we never left the front desk without great directions accompanied by a map with all the information drawn on it. Applause, Applause to all the front desk personnel, all shifts.) When we wanted to go the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum they not only purchased tickets for us on line, but also printed the tickets so we would not have to wait in lines at the museums. Our room was beautifully decorated and very comfortable, as were the down stairs sitting areas. All were comfortable and beautifully furnished and impeccably taken care of. Actually, thinking more about it we would say everything in the hotel was elegant and stylish! In the main area on the ground floor there is a really beautiful bar area and an exquisite dinning area where we enjoyed our delicious buffet breakfast each morning, a lovely library and living room area. Their beautiful salt water fish tank between the front desk and sitting area is absolutely memorizing to watch. So, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get down to the bottom line.

Before I start though it is worth mentioning that Amsterdam is an energetic city with noisy streets everywhere and if you are looking for a quiet hotel centrally with charm and views, you will be hard pushed to find a perfect one. We were looking for something with a few luxuries, not too central but close enough to not spend more than 15 minutes walking to main attractions. The Pros: The location is perfect. The hotel is very clean. The room was immaculate. The staff were certainly friendly enough, although there seemed to be a significant rotation of staff and I was challenged a couple of times simply because the staff had not seen me before. Free slippers (not comfortable though). Free internet - always working ok. Communal lounge areas were pleasant and relaxing. The Cons: The room was generally small but just ok, the toilet just 1m2, bathroom had a jacuzzi bath but actually it is not good - the jacuzzi mode is not proper jacuzzi & just pumped bubbles and so loud - louder than any vacuum cleaner, 30 seconds was enough to realise that it is not relaxing at all. There was a chandelier at chest height over the bed (I am tall) so I had to crouch whilst on the bed. Loads of grand pillows but no soft ones. Didn't sleep particularly well. There is no tea or coffee in the rooms! Why not? Tea & coffee is free in the lobby downstairs but why should i have to get dressed in the mornings just to get a cup of coffee? No bath robes in the room. Breakfast was an extra 16 euros each on top of the 400 euros for 3 nights. You do get noise through the walls but it wasn't too bad - maybe we had quiet neighbours. You can certainly hear them try the bath though! Summary: This hotel needs to add tea & coffee in the rooms, add bath robes, make the beds more comfortable, get rid of the things that it uses to sell for effect like the 'jacuzzi' baths, remove obstacles like the chandelier that I frequently hit my head on and then it will be a great place to stay. Until then I suggest that it is probably worth looking around. By the way, you need to request a room overlooking the canal if that is what you want.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Collierville, TN", "Title": "\u201cGreatest Hotel Of All Time--Quit Browsing, Stay Here\u201d", "Author": "Hernando_De_Soto", "ReviewID": "UR54280726", "Content": "This hotel rocks!

He merely opened the door for us and expected his two euro tip! When I emailed the front desk to ask about the taxi charges from the train station to the hotel they told me about 10 euros. They didn't bother to mention that all the taxi drivers in Amsterdam cheat on the fares,which is common,common knowl;edge. What the drivers say is--\"you have 4 bags. That costs extra!\" If the hotel staff knew this, in my view they could have easily have said--BEWARE! We were charged 25 euros for a three minute ride. Apparently that was the highest they had heard of from other complaints issued by hotel guests. When we asked about restaurant recommendations they only came up with one name--we indicated that we were just there--could there be another restaurant in all of Amsterdam.They indicated they couldn't think of one but would get back to us. They never did.

Now, if you're a fan of American chain hotels, or you're looking for a pool, or if you have a low tolerance for charm - you won't like this hotel. The rooms range from very small to cosy; the hallways are narrow; there isn't 24-hour room service. That, however, is just about all the non-praise I can think of to say about this wonderful small hotel. We arrived for a second stay at the Estherea at a ridiculously early hour after a very long overnight flight, and while our room wasn't ready, my partner and I agreed that there were few hotels in the world where we would actually look forward to spending a few hours waiting. We sat in the lovely, serene library, enjoying the complimentary coffee and biscuits, reading through the range of European papers and local guides on offer, and admiring the fresh orchids scattered around the polished side tables. Once in our very comfortable canal-view room (very much worth the extra cost, both for the exquisite view and for the size of the room), we felt immediately at home. Spotlessly clean, with bright wallpaper, two comfortable chairs, and a small but well-appointed bathroom, our room proved a great homebase to explore the city on foot, easy given the Estherea's perfect central location. In the year since our last visit, 20 more rooms have been added, creating a central courtyard with a nice glass elevator but not altering the essential character of the Estherea at all.

The journey from the airport by train was very simple and we were able to walk (about 15-20 mins) from the station to the hotel. This was our first attempt at navigating by the canals and this definitely makes Amsterdam one of the easier cities to walk around. The hotel was in an excellent location for what we wanted to do. Nice to be on a canal, so a bit quieter, and equidistant between the Centraal Station and the museum quarter, whilst being close to the Dam Square and Anne Frank House museum. The hotel interior is boldly decorated (in nice old-style prints) and this character continued into the room. The room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t huge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but fine by European city standards \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as others have said, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend much time in your room when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re there, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perfectly adequate. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in smaller rooms in London. It was comfortable and had some nice touches as well as being recently decorated. What was nice was the disproportionately large bathroom, with both a walk-in shower and a separate Jacuzzi bath. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the canal side, but still had a view over the street behind, which was nice. The staff at the front desk were very helpful. The free coffee and tea, biscuits, sweets and iced-minted-lemoned-water more than compensated for not having these facilities in the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which still had water in the mini-bar fridge. We opted for breakfast out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you could get a full continental breakfast of coffee, croissant, butter& jam and a roll with cheese and ham for Eur6,90 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rather than the Eur16 charged by the hotel. There are lots of nice bars and restaurants dotted over the city \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but there is a nice one just down the road (Restaurant & Brasserie Luden) and also try looking in the Jordaan area for a less \u00e2\u20ac\u0153touristy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd place to eat. The Rijksmuseum is undergoing major renovation at the moment, but for a first-time visitor this works well, as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highlights\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the museum are all in the Phillips Wing, which means you can see them all in just 14 rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including The Nightwatch. We were caught out by there not being a cafe inside the museum though, so stop off at a cafe before you go in as we managed to still spend a good two hours in there. The Tui candlelight canal trip goes right past the hotel, which was nice to see from the water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertised tour boat company that you get brochures on when you arrive, so maybe they all go past.

The only rooms the Estherea originally had available were non canal-view, but when we checked in, a canal-view room was available. We looked at our choice of rooms and the canal-view was a no brainer, though it was yet another upgrade. No doubt the most expensive hotel stay we've ever had (nearly $2500 for the seven nights) but we have such great memories and feelings about the Estherea. Room 110 if I recall. We found it very spacious. King size bed. Nice bathroom, small fridge, desk and sitting area, but the absolute winner was the three large windows that overlooked the Singel. Gorgeous. We had breakfast at the hotel just once as the 16E p/p price was a bit much. Several very good breakfast eateries and bakeries are nearby. Coffee/tea/hot chocolate and treats are available in the lobby 24/7. Lobby is beautiful with dark wood furniture, large, comfortable rose-colored chairs and sofas, and a stunning chandelier. There is also a bar with small sitting area. The lobby also has a huge fresh-water fish tank with an aquarium assortment of amazingly colored fish. Mesmerizing.

The beds and pillows were very comfortable. Also in the room were a large dresser/desk, two casual chairs, a small coffee table, two bedside tables and a small television. There was a large closet, extra shelves, and a mini refrigerator (stocked with two free waters every day). A small programmable safe is available in the room at no extra charge; two pairs of slippers are also provided at no charge. We noticed very little noise while inside our hotel room. The room seemed a bit cool at times, and we couldn't seem to get the thermostat to operate. I suspect the heat was turned off--or perhaps we had to request it to be turned on. It wasn't a problem though, as the outdoor temps were warm enough not to need heat in the rooms. The bathroom was well stocked with toiletries and towels, and there was a wall-mounted hair dryer.

However, spring flowers and houseplants were common sights along the streets, many shrubs already had their leaves, and the grass was vibrant green.

We tried to confirm our reservation by email about a month prior to our trip. Strangely, they never got back to us, but we assumed we were OK being we never received any word of a problem. Since we were visiting in March, I doubt the hotel was full--so a missing reservation could be easily resolved.

The size of the room was standard for a room in a European capital. The bathroom was fine. The elevator is small, but we were fine taking the stairs just to burn some calories. At 16 Euro the breakfast is outstanding and nicely presented (here is were you collect calories); choices are almost too numerous to mention; custom tosti's available upon request; and fried or scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and ham; variety of sliced cheese and cold cuts, choice of juices; plenty of fresh fruits; choice of cereals, crackers and dark rye snack breads; many choices of other breads; yogurts, jams and cheese spreads; muesli, dried fruits, pastries and the list goes on. Check out the buffet before you make your choices. Many specialty tea choices and coffee at breakfast and same available complimentary all day in the lobby . Truly a good value, (not by American standards, but you are not in America) the average breakfast at an Amsterdam hotel will set you back 20 to 22 Euros. Take it from a Canadian born in the Netherlands! The other common spaces/rooms in this hotel are as represented on the website; very warm and inviting and true to Amsterdam style decor. No complaints here. Location is fine too; a nice neighbourhood and walking distance to Centraal Station and many attractions. Upon check out I inquired about the nicely decorated rooms presented on their website - I speak Dutch - but it was ignored. So, in the future, if we stay at this hotel again, I will make sure I know which room I am staying in and if not, we will go elsewhere in the city. Would I recommend this hotel to a friend?

My husband and I were given two single beds pushed together as a double bed. We didnt complain as we were staying for two nights only but I did find this very comfortable. Secondly it was perishing cold in Amsterdam at this time of year, however the heating was turned off when we arrived late at night so we had to wait for the room to heat up. Again the following day we went out doing touristy things upon our return to the room the story was the same, heating off. I found this to be an inconvenience as it was bitterly cold outside. However we had the facility to turn it back on again as soon as we came in. All the same though it took a bit of time for the room to heat up and this also took from giving an overall good impression of the hotel.

My husband and I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and found it to be wonderful. It was in a great location - about a 5 minute walk to Dam Square and about 20 mins to the Anne Frank House and Central Station. The staff was always approachable and helpful. They booked tickets for us for the Anne Frank house, in order to skip over the very very long line. I highly suggest doing this. We got our tickets at the hotel front desk, and skipped an hour long line to walk straight into the museum. The tickets were the same price as buying them directly at the Anne Frank House. The staff also provided us with free ponchos and use of umbrellas during the rainy days. If coffee shops are on your agenda, there are many places near the hotel to check out. There are 2 shops within a 3-5 minute walk and dozens more within a 5-15 minute walk. The free cookies/pastries/coffee/tea/hot chocolate in the lobby was a great perk. We saved quite a few Euros by snacking at the hotel instead of at a cafe! Breakfast is 16 Euro per person, which is quite pricey. We peeked into the breakfast room one morning to see what we were missing and we were not missing much. We opted out of breakfast and went to a small bakery on the corner. We each ate breakfast for 5 Euro there - a much better choice than the 16 Euro option! We ate dinner one night at Caprese - the Italian restaurant on the street behind the hotel with the yellow and white awning. It was inexpensive, compared to many other restaurants in the area and it was absolutely delicious. Our room was wonderful. The bed was ok - not the best, but certainly not the worst. My only complaint in the room was the hair dryer. It was very weak and semi-broken. (I had to hold down the \"on\" button constantly or else the dryer would turn off.) Other than that, the room was great! I would certainly put this hotel in a 4 star class - not a 3 star, as listed.

It was so small, that when I took the large decorative pillows off the bed the only place to put them was on the floor and that left maybe 5 narrow feet to walk around the bed that was wedged in an alcove. The room could best be described as shabby, carpet that hadn't been changed in 20 years (an issue because you had to get on your hands and knees to get to the room safe in the bottom of the cupboard - not a closet). There were holes in the walls left unfilled, 80's style metallic wall paper and beat up cheaply made furniture. It did have a view on the canal, but that just meant it was noisy - I could hear a couple talking at normal voice through the walls too. I asked to move and of course they were full. The staff was reasonably friendly but not helpful. The only good points were the neighborhood and the breakfast. The lobby was rather grand, but in the flower capital of the world it was odd to see so many fake, glittery flower arrangements and I never spent time in the lobby anyway. So still searching for a decent reasonably priced hotel in Amsterdam.", "Date": "April 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotteville, VA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience\u201d", "Author": "ohmyGOSH", "ReviewID": "UR15144456", "Content": "I was delighted with this hotel which I booked after reading the very favorable comments on TA.

I am sure we will stay here again. The location of the hotel is great. Unless you are into the honkey tonk bar scene, sex workers, or just general touristy places, I highly recommend the quieter west side of the historic downtown. The streets and canals are elegant, it feels very safe, and you won't be awaken by the rowdy bar crawlers in the middle of the night.

The location was unbeatable - no matter where we wanted to go in the city, it was an easy walk. We finally took the tram the last night, just for the experience. We had a double without the canal view, but it was very spacious. The bathroom, though small, was both spotless, and well equipped. The price was very fair. Even with the sad state of the dollar, it average the same as a recent stay at the San Diego Embassy Suites. I can't thank all the reviewers enough for all the great information that they have given in their reviews. They helped make our trip go smoothly. From needing our credit card pin number to get the train tickets from the airport to finding the Gollum - a neat brown cafe -your advice was invaluable. I strongly recommend reading all the reviews you can- I felt so comfortable choosing restaurants and finding places - like the advice from about 25 close friends! Don't hesitate trying the Luden - just around the block. The food was terrific, reasonably priced, especially in the Brasserie in the front,and felt like being in Paris. The Cafe Luxembourg was also fun, and just a little further down the street. The soups and fries were especially good. The hotel's location near so many great restaurants is just icing on the cake. We tried the hotel breakfast, and it was very good, but also crowded because they were full while we were there. So we only ate there once. Broodje Bert on the corner serves a bargain full breakfast or just a roll if you want, simple but fun to sit down and watch the world go by in front of you while sipping your coffee.

Overall, I really liked the hotel. The location is great -- it's on a beautiful, quiet canal, really central to everything we wanted to see. The room (#410) was pretty nice - we had requested a larger room on an upper floor facing the canal and that's what we got. It was a good size with lots of light. 3 large windows which opened to the canal. I think that the website makes the rooms look nicer than they are though - at least our room. I expected it to be a bit more luxurious than it actually was. The orange bedding with pale green & white walls I didn't really like ... but the view of the canal was great. Glad I got a canal view room as it made for some great photos (especially at night). My favorite things about the hotel were the gorgeous lobby, which had a really beautiful and well-done aquarium in it, the location, the view from the room, and the free chocolates and little cakes in the lobby all day. Everytime I went in and out I ate some more chocolate!! A girl can't complain too much with that. Things I didn't like : I agree with a previous poster about the bed, I didn't find it very comfortable, and I think it had a plastic liner on it which made the sheets really rough and you kind of stuck to it in the morning, ew. Also the bathroom was quite tiny and the sink didn't drain very well - but that (the sink) could have probably been fixed if we'd told anyone about it. From the floor plan, it looks like all of the canal facing rooms have small bathrooms - the larger ones are towards the back of the hotel. One of the guys at the front desk was pretty unfriendly. My boyfriend is a native dutch speaker but whenever he would talk to the him he would answer in English and acted really annoyed that my friend kept speaking to him in Dutch. It was really weird.

I had to give him 400 euro in the end. This left us with very little cash. When we were shown to our room it was tiny really small. The end of the bed was 1 foot from the wall and there was less than a foot either side of the room.We thought there was no bathroom and when we opened the door to what we thought was a wardrobe it was actually a toilet and tiny bath. When you closed the \"toilet\" door there was a 4inch gap really nice. I spoke to the front desk and they said they would change rooms the next day and to be fair they did give us a nice room at the top of the house. I did not enjoy this hotel at all i found the staff rude and unhelpful and the facilates poor.Watch what room you get i did request and pay for a deluxe to start with however there idea of deluxe is a view of the canal.This hotel is not worthy of a four star more basic 3 star", "Date": "December 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sauk Centre, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cPeaceful, high-class comfort\u201d", "Author": "crisro", "ReviewID": "UR11691533", "Content": "Was so completely disappointed with the Brower down the street we checked a website and found room specials at this place for only 10 euros a night more (and no breakfast).

The rooms were updated with great linens and very clean. The common areas were very cozy. I didn't eat at the hotel restaurant. Breakfast is very pricey and we didn't want to eat that much so we went a few doors down to get a baguette for breakfast-1 Euro. One thing I loved about the hotel was the free coffee/tee bar they have in the lobby. It's a beautiful bit of custom-built carpenty that has all sorts of teas, sweeteners, and an awesome coffee maker where you just press a button. This is a great perk in a hotel when you just want to get going in the morning and don't want to have to sit down and order a simple cup of coffee.

The entree, the lobby, the rooms (see photo), hallways and the restaurant areas are very well and tastefully decorated. It's classy from the outside (see photo) and from the inside.

The bad: we were placed in a tiny (see photo) 'normal' double room (but with a great view of the canal, see photo). They did say that if the room was too small, we could switch and this was one of the smallest room in the hotel. We only spend there one night, so with little luggage it was ok for one night. We would not have stayed in that room for any longer. The bathroom was tiny too. There was not enough room for two people. There wasn't even enough room for one! Another bad thing was the noise. We could hear the people above us walking around in their room, we could hear the slamming of closet doors from our neighbors and all the noise from the hallways. Also we couldn't seem to get the heater down, the temperature was centrally controlled. It caused the room to be way too warm and the air to be as dry as the air in airplanes. Our eyes even hurt a bit! So we slept with the window open. But the window did cause the street sounds to come in. Even though this is a relatively quiet street in Amsterdam, there is really no such thing as a quiet street in Amsterdam. We ended up sleeping very little hours.

The decor is classy and warm, and it has an old charm that for once *doesn't* mean \"run-down and cramped.\" The room we stayed in (four nights) was small. Not quite Manhattan small, but definitely not spacious. Enough room for two people and two suitcases. The bed was comfortable and large, and the hotel staff was more than willing to give us extra pillows. We had a view of some other rooms' windows (very close by), so we had to keep the curtains closed at all times. If possible, I'd recommend asking for a room with an exterior view. The bathroom was clean and luxurious. My only gripe with the bathroom was that the towels were a bit too small. Chalk that up to Americans wanting everything to be oversized! The breakfast buffet here is pretty decent... I think we paid 14 euros per person, and we got fruit, cereal, scrambled eggs, pastries, etc. Standard, but fresh and well-stocked. They gave us free (small) bottles of water in the guest room every day, which is a nice touch. Unfortunately, I think our guest room was right above the kitchen area, so every morning around 7am, we heard the swinging doors to the kitchen and the clanging of plates right through the vents in our room. It wasn't a huge deal, and might not be an issue in other rooms, but you might want to bring earplugs just in case, if you plan on sleeping past 7am. Another minor gripe is the hotel's strange policy of wanting you to leave your room key at the front desk when you leave. The keys are on a keyring that has a magnificently posh tassle on it... which would be cumbersome to carry around, anyway. But this means that you have to wait in line at the front desk to get your key or drop off your key. In other words, allow yourself a few minutes on the way back to your guest room. ...I'm reluctant to mention it here, but you have to wonder how easy it would be for a thief to get into a guest room by simply asking the staff for a certain guest room's key by number. They didn't check our ID or anything when we asked for our key. In all, we'd recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Amsterdam.

It was good to find complimentary mineral waters every day in the minibar, also a steam iron and board in the wardrobe. The TV had BBC 1, 2, World, CNN, Discovery and pay channels in English. The bathroom was pretty and clean with elegant but practical facilities including a magnifying mirror, a washing line and a good long shelf to keep everything dry. Along with wall dispensers their Hydro basics toiletries had a botanic aroma suitable for men and women. I am sorry the last reviewer had a bad experience but when I think how much I have paid for bleak Amsterdam hotels with cramped rooms and no lift, I thought the Estherea was excellent value.

We refused the room (they were maybe expecting we would accept it because we booked it on the internet with a discount - why do they have to try it, thinking people are stupid - it is always unpleasant to refuse rooms). We changed to room 415. This room was a little bit bigger, still with no view and had really nothing special. We had to accept it as we were told there was nothing else. We waked up several times during the two nights of our stay. We could actually hear each step of the neighbors on top (what is unpleasant) and more important the hotel was noisy (you can easely hear the neighbors when they come during the night, when they leave in the morning or when they just talk). On top of that, the shower was not working the second day. Globally, we found this hotel very expensive for what it is (especially if you have to pay 250 euros for a standard - basic room) and were disappointed.

I requested room 417 because I had read it had a really nice canal view. I kind of badgered the hotel about it before arriving, which apparently worked because I got room 317, which also had a nice view. They knew exactly my preferences when I checked in! Nice size room, gorgeous linens, although the bathroom towels were itty-bitty! Very odd. Great bath products and the shower had a retractable clothesline, which was really cool and which we utilized. I paid 220 per night for the room which did NOT include tax - so it was more like 230 per night. Well worth it though - it was close enough to be within walking distance of everything we wanted to see, yet far enough from the RLD to be away from the noise and riffraff. Excellent. Everyone who worked the front desk was really friendly and nice - another place where you have to turn in and recieve your key whenever you leave or come back - sigh! The one exception was one lady who personally struck me as weird and not helpful. I don't recall her name, but she was in her late 40s or so, had blond hair and glasses and was short. She gave us a weird fake smile whenever we saw her and we ended up avoiding her whenever possible. When we first arrived, I asked for a recommendation for a good Thai restaurant within walking distance and she got this puzzled look on her face like she had never been asked that question in her life! she immediately went over to the computer, presumably to do a google search. Amsterdam has a gazillion good Thai restaurants, according to my guidebooks and friends who have visited there - not a weird question by any means! When I saw her going to the computer for help I said forget it, please just recommend anyplace good within walking distance. She recommended Broodje Bert, right next to the hotel. Although the food wasn't horrible, I can't recommend this place. They are just sandwiches and the service is excruciatingly slow, even by European standards. I would have walked a little further, had I known how close the pancake restaurants were to the hotel. One really nice gentleman working the front desk recommended an Indian restaurant, Shiva, which was awesome. The free coffee and water were also a nice touch. The afternoon snacks were a nice idea, but imo didn't taste very good. My only real complaint was that when I made the reservation, the hotel emailed me that the rate did not include tax or breakfast. But one day out of desperation, we decided to eat the breakfast even though it was 14 Euros per day. The buffet was excellent and no complaints - except that everyone there seemed to have the breakfast included in their rate. Nobody asked us for our room number or had us sign anything - we could have been eating the breakfast all three days!! Why tell me that it wasn't included? I felt kind of ripped off in that regard. Overall I would stay here again without hesitation. I feel certain that this is the nicest hotel of its class in Amsterdam.

Room was a bit small but very tastefully decorated and enough space for what you needed. We also asked for a canal view room when we arrived and were not charged any extra for it. Hotel Staff were really friendly and helpful, nothing too much trouble. Tea, coffee etc all complimentary 24 hours a day in the reception area, help yourself. Nothing in rooms but okay to go downstairs and take up to the room. Cake and fruit also complimentary. Did not have breakfast in hotel as not up early enough! We got a train from the airport for 4 euros each and it was only a 15/20 minute journey. Much cheaper than taxi and then we walked to the hotel from station. Recommend Majestic Bar in Dam Square for a drink and spot of people watching! It served Thai food and nibbles as well which was reasonably priced and tasty. Also Caressa Restaurant (I think) little Italian behind the hotel which was really good. Very busy so a good sign to eat there. Bar De Waag in New Square Market really good for midday snacks and evening meal. Definitely recommend to my friends and would definitely go back again. One thing I would suggest is that we went from Tuesday to Friday so missed the majority of the stag/hen parties.

From Schiphol airport we got the train from under the airport to Central Station. This was rather confusing for novices - you need to ensure you have enough coins to buy tickets from the machines - 3 Euro 60 each, or pay more at the ticket office. The hotel is almost a mile from there, so we got tram 5 to Spuistraat, from where the hotel was just a short walk. We were lucky to get a large room and bathroom on the top floor, but no view as it looked into the internal courtyard/lightwell. I was disappointed at first because of this, but it turned out not to be a problem as we spent very little time in the room. The room was very well furnished and decorated to a high standard. Everything was immaculately clean. Igor would have changed our room if we'd wanted to, but I soon got to like it. The staff are very friendly, helpful and polite. The ground floor of the hotel has sumptuous, classically elegant decor, which I loved, and we spent quite a bit of time relaxing and enjoying this area. The chandeliers are something else. They have put in a lot of thought here to cater well for guests, with a wide selection of complimentary beverages, in Delft china, on tap constantly in the foyer. Fruit, chocolates, pastries and cookies were also offered. All this can be enjoyed in the comfortable lounges/library/bar - somewhere to relax and enjoy meeting other guests. We enjoyed meeting some American guests - it is a sociable hotel because of these common areas. The tropical fish tank in the lounge area is fabulous - it has an awesome variety of fish, and various beautiful corals growing in it. The hotel is well located on the Singel Canal, a quietish (not much traffic - mainly bikes) upmarket area, where you are spoilt for choice for bars, cafes, restaurants and pastry shops within easy walking distance. Spuistraat, behind the hotel, has lots of restaurants and ends in Spui Square, which buzzes with cafes and bars. We enjoyed Cafe Luxembourg here. We also enjoyed dutch food at Haesje Claes on Spuistraat, Italian at Casa di David on Singel - lovely ambience, and Indonesian at Cilubang on Runstraat (we had the Reijstaffel, an interesting selection of small dishes rather like tapas). Broodje Bert, next block down, is good for very reasonably priced lunch. (Bertburger was excellent)! We had lots of rides on the Canal Bus - a fun way to get a good look around the city. We didn't use the trams because you can easily walk to most places from Singel You have to be very 'bike aware' as they are everywhere! I will hire one next time to save my feet from aching at night after so much walking on cobbles. I am already planning to return in the Autumn and would choose to stay at the Estherea again.

We were far from disappointed. Our room was on the fourth floor and we were given a canal view at no extra charge.

The room was very tastefully decorated and the bathroom was more than adequate with plenty of hot water to soak those tired limbs. We stayed four nights between 15-19th March 2007 and from the outset could not have asked for more helpful and conscientious staff. Advice was given as to a good restaurant on the night we arrived. Our flight had been delayed and it was 2145 by the time we booked into the hotel. The staff made the reservation for us whilst we freshened up and were also happy to make reservations for our choices over the following nights. The lobby of the hotel and surrounding lounge and bar are very comfortable and again very pleasing to the eye. I read previous moans about the breakfast and yes if you look around you will I'm sure find cheaper deals. However the hotel restaurant is cosy, with nice tablecloths and pottery and the choice of food and drink is plentiful (14 Euros per Head) The location is excellent being centrally located. Everwhere is within walking distance, but importantly the hotel is surrounded by great eating establishments. Directly behind the hotel is one of the best fish restaurants one could hope for. Lucius, Spuistraat 247. We went twice it was that good. Not cheap, but plenty of atmosphere and bistro appearance. Casa di David further along Singel from the hotel provided great Italien food, but recommend you book particularly on a week-end. Good, wholesome Dutch food at Haesje Claes, again behind the hotel, along from Lucius. Cafe Gommel around the corner (left out the hotel down the alley) is a great old bar and try the Cheeseboard for a good snack at just over 4 Euros. Finally, fresh pitta bread at the Greek adjacent to the hotel is well worth a visit. To example the great efforts of the staff, my wife lost both her wedding and eternity ring whilst in Amsterdam. We reported this to the reception, where before long one ring had been recovered from one of the washing machines in the laundry.

To drink, you'll find a variety of juices, milk, coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. They'll even make you a cappucino if you ask. I believe breakfast is 16 euro if not included in your rate.

The night before checking out, I asked the receptionist if he could book me a taxi to take me to the airport for the morning. He replied that there is no need to book in Amsterdam, as taxis can be called to arrive immediately. The following morning, there were no taxis available for at least 1 hour, and the manager informed me that I should have booked the night before, because of the convention. When I told him what his staff had said , he merely shrugged his shoulders and said 'his mistake'. There were around 15 guests who all needed to get a taxi, all of whom were furious. In the end we shared taxis, and only just managed to catch our flights.

We kept the curtains shut but had to keep the windows open while we were in, as the room was quite stuffy and the bathroom had no ventilation (there was a tiny, tiny one which didn't seem to do the job at all) The walls & ceilings were so thin - we couldn't hear the next door but we could even hear people whispering in the corridor, footsteps on the squeaky floor upstairs were almost unbearable. Peculiar thing was this..... You return the key to the reception everytime you go out, so they know which guests are in or out. On the 1st day when we went out for a dinner, we left some lights on and made sure all our windows were shut (dodgy patio!), came back a couple of hours later to find all the lights turned off and one of the top small windows open. 2nd day while we were out they changed the furniture - changed the bedside table, entire dressing table & all our things in the drawers were taken out (ok but why? we thought we were in the wrong room!) Evening of the 3rd day we deliberately left all the lights on and went out for a meal, came back few hours later to find some lights off, fridge door wide open (again WHY?????) small windows open again... We're not making up the story! And certainly we were not on the magic mushroom or whatever that is!! As soon as we go out they come in to check the room, open the window for ventilation and sneak out! Well there was a safe in the room so we weren't too concerned about the security... Shower was powerful. Free tea/coffee machine at the reception. But then it would have been a lot nicer if there was a kettle facility in each room. The hotel's in the nice part of the city, stunning chandelier & aquerium tank at the reception... The mystery of freaky guestroom-checker remains, but besides that, I would only recommend this hotel if you're prepared to pay more for better rooms.", "Date": "April 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "N.I.", "Title": "\u201cLovely place\u201d", "Author": "Koalaguinness", "ReviewID": "UR5018701", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights in mid-February and found it a lovely place from which to enjoy Amsterdam.

This little personal touch together with the complimentary hot drinks sweets and chocolates show us that the large, soulless chain hotels have much to learn from the smaller, family-run hotels which go the extra mile. Amsterdam is a compact city and whilst the Estherea is in a quiet location it is no more than two or three minutes walk from the bars, restaurants and shops. This is the best of both worlds. The management gives guests a list of recommended restaurants within walking distance. We tried two of them, an Indonesian in Rembrandt Square and a Thai restaurant, both of which were excellent.

At first we were very satisfied by the hotel because it is beautiful, our room was large, clean, well decorated, and had a nice view on the canal, and the staff made a good impression on us. The first problem arose on the first night: our room was on the first floor and we were disturbed around 1a.m by a group of people talking loudly right under our windows, probably waiting for some friends on the doorstep of the hotel. Apparently, nothing special has been done for (external)noise insulation. However it only last 15 minutes and thus was a minor problem. Note that we could not hear any noise coming from other rooms. The second problem was of much greater importance. We asked for a non-smoking room, as usual, because we are, though french, very sensitive (negatively) to cigarette smoke. The room was indeed non-smoking, and nobody had smoked in our room, but the room in front of ours (room #115) was a smoking room. And the guests in room #115, in their right, were unfortunately smoking a lot. Our room was invaded by smoke all night and we had to sleep with an open window in spite of the outside temperature (I would say around -5 \u00c2\u00b0C). At the reception, after checking the corridor, they admitted that there was indeed a lot of smoke but could not do anything because room #115 was a smoking room and the hotel was full (so that they could not give us another room). We thus spent a terrible second night in that hotel. We however appreciated the breakfast (non smoking area). Note that it is not included in the room price (extra 14 EUR per person). Note also that the hotel has no restaurant but that there are plenty right next to it. I did not ask for any discount (not my style, at least with my wife standing next to me :C), but when I checked out, they did not ask me whether I had enjoyed my stay, they did not apologize, and did not offer any kind of compensation.

You can walk anywhere from here or catch a tram, but if you have luggage, a taxi is Eur 10 or less from Amsterdam Centraal. 2) Very attractive lobby with extensive sitting areas, a big aquarium, and all the charm of a 17th century Dutch canalhouse. 3) Well-decorated room with soft lighting, a soft off-orange paint job, and very comfortable bed. 4) Responsive management. We had a billing problem that was very quickly resolved by management. 5) Informative website with detailed property history. CONS 1) Breakfast is 14 Euro extra. We skipped it. There are dozens of quaint little cafes within a 10-minute walk of the hotel, most of which have English menus and good breakfasts for Eur 6/person. Just walk in the direction of Jordaan. 2) Bath amenities. You'll encounter quintessential Dutch cheapness when there is no soap, shampoo, or conditioner in the bathroom.

The courtesy free tea, coffee and fruit is an excellant extra touch which we have not had before in any top class hotel. The only thing which we felt was lacking was the fact that the entire public area on the ground floor, including the bar area,was non smoking and while we accept this suited many people, it surely would have been possible to select one small area where smoking was permitted. Smoking was allowed in the rooms so it was not a problem but it did mean we did not tend to sit for too long in the public areas as we would have done between our sightseeing trips.

We had to leave the window open at night and the noise from the street is too much for a good night sleep. Carpet in the room was shabby and stained, bed was very small for double, a tiny tv, smallest desk and above all the shower room was separate from the toilet and at the opposite end. We had our toiletries at two places and still ran out of place to put everything. You can hear every noise from adjoining rooms and it is not pleasant...I dont understand how they call themselves 4* when they cannot even provide simple amenities like door signs, shampoo, conditioner, iron (available upon request but house cleaning took it back every day), hair drier was the slowest one I've ever seen in my life. And the two glasses provided in the bathroom were chipped and cracked. Now you dont expect that from a hotel with this reputation, do u? It actually encouraged us to stay out as much as possible and therefore, we got to see quite alot. I think its a hit and miss with this hotel. All the rooms are different sizes (looking at the fire safety map) and therefore different decore. I dont think anyone staying in one of the back room has reviewed this hotel here. Certainly avoid the rooms at the back if you can but then u r charged extra for a canal view room. On the positive side, the hotel (outside our room) was very nice, it is centrally located - just 5 mins from Dam square, easily reachable from central station - tram nos 1, 2, 5, 13 stop at Spui which is under 5 mins away, breakfast was adequate and staff is polite.

The best thing about the hotel is its location, but that's not to say that it is the only good thing about it. But first things first. Adjoining the Spui, in the inner part of the Western Canal Belt on the Singel, near the Jordaan, near the Beginhof, with many excellent restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping areas and major tram access all within very close walking distance, it is probably as well located a hotel as there is in Amsterdam. It is amazing that this place can maintain relative quiet but it does. The rooms are small, but clean, with very nice bathrooms. The first room we were taken to was not exactly to our liking (though we would have been fine had they not been willing to let us change) but the staff was very nice and made a room change to a room that was more to our liking with little effort. Both rooms had canal views. They offer free coffee, tea and hot chocolate (available 24/7), they have a nice bar and a breakfast room with a typical dutch buffet breakfast (we didn't eat there -- we chose to eat breakfast at several nearby places that gave a much better slice of local experience). The hotel has apparently been owned by the same family for a long time, and it is pretty obvious -- much of the staff seemed related to one another. We were very happy there, more for the location than the rooms themselves, but there were nice amenities, nice rooms and excellent value for the money (and the location is definitely superior to many far more expensive and only marginally nicer hotels). At the end of 6 nights, we weren't sick of the place, which also says something. A word to those who care about such things. The Estherea is not cannibas friendly -- they politely but firmly make it clear that cannibas smoking is not allowed in the hotel. However, being within a block of Tweed Kamer, one of the most interesting and eclectic coffee shops in Amsterdam, and several others as well, it really didn't matter.
