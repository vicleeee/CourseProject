Its elegant, with plenty of windows for you to soak in the rooftop view, and there was a really nice variety of hot and cold breakfast food that was well tended to by the staff. The bedroom on the other hand was HORRIBLE. Completely not sound proof in the least, we were constantly awakened by anyone and everyone that climbed the stairs, took the elevator, or entered/exited their rooms on our side of the floor. The bathtub/shower situation is a joke. The furniture is visibly decaying - seriously we were thinking that if they could just varnish the chair, change the drapes, and sand and paint a little it would be at least a little better. BUT since there are apparently nicer rooms in the hotel, we would stay here again if we could stay in one of those rooms.

Reviews from burned customers always make me roll my eyes. I'm not normally so bothered but having been treated in such a way. I would like to share my experience so you don't make my mistake. This is rated as 4 Star. In all my travels around the world my only comparison is to think cheap motel meets Renaissance brothel and you get the picture. Upon arriving to my room I was almost sick with the smell of what could only be described as getting on a bus on a hot day with 30 hobos that hadn't washed in a month. The experience was only enhanced by a nonfunctioning A/C unit. Three of the staff including the manager all came to mess around with the knobs and dials and to tell me that (despite being on full power) there was some air coming out of the vent. An interesting observation given that I couldn't feel a thing. No appropriate compensation was offered and during the course of the discussion it was strongly implied that I am a liar. I was even told that the payment was taken by the .com agency. I checked with them, not so. I rest my case for the honesty stakes. This 4 star hotel would suit you if you are looking for a motel style stay but want to part with all your spare cash. For a considerable fee you can expect to experience plastic cups wrapped in plastic, \"Exclusive\" toiletries such as wafer thin bars of soap wrapped in large amounts of plastic, a small sachet of shampoo and shower cap. If you like the bed linen you will also find this for your hand towel. The toilet paper will be found propped up against the wall on the bidet as there is no holder, although the bathroom is so small you'll not have to hunt far for it. I'm glad I didn't want too much privacy as the bathroom door was broken (in my \"newly refurbished room\" according to management). If you'd like a thicker pillow you'll need to fold the one you get in two but at least there was only one sheet on the bed otherwise I may have passed out in the night given the non-functional A/C. Pleasantly it is in a quiet spot. Useful when you need to open the windows to let the smell and the heat out. Rome is a beautiful place.

The Hotel Bolivar is situated in the center of Rome, walking distance from the Colosseum, as well as numerous other cultural and historical sites. The hotel's location is it's main selling point! The Bolivar claims to be a 4 star hotel. This might have been true in the 1960's. It hasn't been renovated since then. Though the concierge was extremely welcoming, the hotel was not. Our rooms were relatively spacious, but poorly maintained. The windows leaked, making it extremely cold at night. This wouldn't have been a problem had the hotel had a heating system (which according to the front desk, it does not have any heating/ cooling system). Other than the cold, it was difficult to sleep at night because of the terribly uncomfortable bed... and the noise. The walls are very thin, and every night when people would come back from partying at 2-3am, we would hear everything. Trying to give the hotel a fair chance, I looked at things such as cleanliness to make me feel better about staying there. Big mistake! The toilet paper was kept on the handle of the toilet brush (which looked like an original piece from the hotel's establishment decades ago). The sheets were not changed during the 3 days we spent at the hotel. There was hair in the bathtub, as opposed to soap and/ or shampoo, which was unavailable. A 'household incident' left hair cream on the mirror, which wasn't cleaned on during the entire duration of our stay... and to top it all off, breakfast was very poor - no fruits or veggies anywhere in sight, save for some canned peaches in a dish. When my friend and I checked out, I did feel bad for the person at the front desk. In all her frustration, my friend verbally attacked the man over the poor state of the hotel and it's service... or lack thereof. I guess we should consider ourselves lucky he was at the front desk, as most times the staff members were outside the front entrance smoking and we would have to wait 10-15mins for someone to appear at the front desk, lobby 'cafe,' etc. During our time in Rome, we passed plenty of gorgeous hotels.

Booked this hotel on leisure before going to Tivoli on business. Checked in on Friday night and very nice personnel. English was ok, but tried to be accomodating. When I was escorted to my room (114,) I was shocked at how small it was. I guess our business travel agent had booked a single. But it did not look like the pictures on the website. I have done a lot of travel in Europe, so small doesn't surprise me, but this was SMALL. The bathroom door doesn't open all the way, you have to straddle the bidet to sit on the toilet and can barely squeeze through the corner shower doors. The closet was so small the hangers barely fit and if your suitcase is left in the room you cannot walk. The room was very dated, with old carpeting and old headboard and old fabric walls. But the bathroom was clean. The worst part of all was in the morning when I woke up with a sewer smell coming from the bathroom. I could not open the window to air out. Needless to say, I had nothing to compare to so thought this was the norm. However, my work collegue came to meet the next day and we didn't see her room until that night (223.) What a difference. You could walk in the room. The shower seemed huge in comparison, didn't have to straddle anything on the toilet and the floors were tiled. Most of all....No smell. When asked to change upon return to the hotel in the evening and the smell getting much worse, the front desk said they could not change due to being fully booked. Also, they stated that our rooms were different rates, yet we were charged the same although I had booked for one addtional night. They stated that even though we booked the same room rate, they had to upgrade her at no charge because the single room was not available. I did find out that they had closed rooms that day due to the sewer problem. This may have been the reason for the upgrade. After much pleading, they did come up and put deordizer down the bathroom drain after three attempts (which probably explains why I didn't smell it when I walked in) and opened the window. They did change my room to the double deluxe (222) that was similar to my colleagues the next day and I was charged the same rate. However, I had to get through a night of intense sewer smell which made me quite ill. When I went down the next morning, the manager, Peter, asked why I would have posted a review on TripAdvisor that was negative instead of talking to him. It was the hotel's opinion since I did not tell them of the smell they could not change me at 9:30 at night when I returned because of being fully booked. As stated, they had closed other rooms in the hotel due to the sewer problem so I am not sure why they didn't move me at that point on their own. It would have been very obvious to the cleaning staff that there was a problem. The front desk staff couldn't stand to be in the bathroom when trying to open the window. They both were gagging. I had tried to wait in the morning to talk, but there was a long line to check out and I had to catch a tour bus. I did not return until the evening and as stated did not know there was an option until I saw my colleagues room. When I tried to take the issue up with Choice Privileges, the hotel admitted the sewer problem as well. They did not offer a discount for the inconvenience. I asked for extra points. They said they would work on it, but have not provided any type of compensation for the problems incurred, nor have even provided the points for the stay I had and paid for. Something about booking through a travel agent. My colleague had to return to the hotel later in the week. They gave her the canopy bed from the hotel pictures and she said it was beautiful. (221?) The management will take care of patrons, that is definite. Unfortunately, they did not take care of me and treated me quite poorly in the process blaming me for the issue as I didn't say anything. As for other hotel ammenities: The breakfast is average. The location is wonderful. If looking to book this hotel, be sure to book a double deluxe room or higher. They are quite nice.

I love being able to walk out my door and go to sights quickly and easily and not have the hassle of additional transportation to and from. In this senario, in European cities, where you are very near the attractions (and in a safe area), I find that I typically give up room size and some ammenities and that often times with the star rating, that location is taken into account.

Our room was serviced each day with fresh towels provided and plenty of them to accomodate our children as well. We felt very safe staying in this part of Rome as we had being forewarned about the Termini station area and advised not to stay anywhere near there. We stayed out each night till about 10pm and 11pm and wandered back safely and securely to our hotel. It's very well placed for visiting the Trevi fountain, the Colessium and the main shopping areas. My only suggestion for the hotel would be to improve their breakfast offering as it consisted of two cereals, 3 juices and different breads. Of course we are a little spoilt in Ireland as we offer hotel guests the option of a full irish breakfast or a continental breakfast so that they don't get bored. Of course, the breakfast at the Hotel Bolivar is a good continental breakfast but if you stay for 5 nights as we did, a little more variety would have been nice.

The lock on the door was falling off, the room itself was so small you could not walk around the bed, the wall covering was well past its best with staining as was the carpet. The bathroom was pretty disgusting with a cracked toilet seat , mould in the shower. and no Jacuzi bath . On top of this, when I asked about the interrnet I was told it was wireless connection only and you must have your own laptop ! I spoke to the Receptionist and asked if they had another room and was given the keys for a room on the 2nd floor. Straight away it looked better with a tiled corridor from the lift rather than a grubby carpet and modern doors to the rooms with swipe cards. The room although again very small was quite delightful, a complete contrast with tiled flooring, ornate ceiling frescoes, chandalier and a spotless modern bathroom with shower and Jacuzi bath !! I asked the Receptionist the cost to upgrade and was given the room at no extra cost which was quite a relief. It appears that all rooms on the ground, 2nd and 3rd floor are as described and pictured on the website however those on the 1st floor look like they are awaiting modernisation and would not qualitfy for 1 star. This hotel was great once we received a room that we believed we had booked from the description on the website. It was an ideal location within walking distance of most places. The breakfast was adequate although the tea and coffee were pretty bad. The only real drawback was the lack of internet access. Wireless facilities are great however not everyone want to take a laptop on holiday. I would book this hotel again as it was a fair price and in a good area however I would specifiy that I would not want a room on the 1st floor.

When we arrived there to check in, we were informed that this Hotel could not accommodate us and we had been moved to another in the Ludovici Group, namely The Hotel Bolivar. No clear reason for this action was given to us but the staff at The Ara Pacis assured me that The Bolivar was either 4 star or of 4 star standard (Italian was used to advise us of this turn in events and, although mine is not perfect, I am absolutely sure \"quattro stelle\" was used). We had no choice but to accept. The Bolivar was in a completely different part of Rome which we found most inconvenient; further, it seemed to me that in many of its service standards it was no better that a 2 star Sicilian pensione. We were charged the full amount for our stay before we could inspect the room. The room in no way resembled that used on their web site; some of the bathroom fittings and finishes were a disgrace; some aspects of the breakfast service were very low standard (plastic juice cups and processed cheese in plastic sheeting is neither 4 nor 3 star). Further, the official State documentation in the room we had clearly indicated the Bolivar was THREE stars not 4.
