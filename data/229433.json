The location is just off the autoroute and Mestre is very industrialised, so it's not exactly picturesque but we were well-prepared so weren't disappointed. The aircon didn't work especially well though (temperature probably set centrally) so we had to sleep with the window open. Whilst checking in, I happened to ask directions to the car park for the Fusina ferry. Cue hard sell on the Holiday Inn minibus to Venice (I think 12 euros each) because 'the car parks are VERY expensive'. Well, I get sick on coaches so that was out anyway but it turned out that terminal Fusina (sounds way grander than it actually is!) was only about a 15-20 minute drive and it really wasn't that much more expensive than the minibus for car parking and the ferry tickets - I think 32 euros in total. And much nicer to arrive in Venice by boat! You need to check the timetable beforehand though as we missed one boat by literally 10 seconds and then had to wait an hour for the next one. It was sunny though and a woman thoughtfully decided to sunbathe topless behind us, to my husband's delight, so the hour passed quite pleasantly ...! My top tip? Look in tourist information offices as we (the day after!) found a Terminal Fusina voucher for a 6 euro discount each. There is an Auchan hypermarket not too far from the hotel and we bought an excellent cooked chicken and fries there for a fraction of the cost of eating in a restaurant.

Beware!\u201d", "Author": "tgsh2007", "ReviewID": "UR120454322", "Content": "First of all let me make clear that this property has the potential to be an excellent hotel. The rooms, although on the small side, are comfortable, clean, and well appointed. On this basis I had no issues whatever. That being said the level of service and staff attitude were both atrocious! As a Priority Club Platinum member I book all my IHG hotels through the PC website. Therefore I rely on accurate descriptions to enable me to make an informed choice of where to stay. Problem number one, the location. Contrary to the website, which states 1.4 KM from Venice Mestre train station, this hotel is around 4 or 5 KM from the station. Buses DO NOT run regularly. And even if you take the bus a 10 minute walk is then required. A taxi for this short journey will cost you between \u00e2\u201a\u00ac16 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20! Problem number two, the internet. This service is provided by Vodafone and the Hotel has no input (apparently). Only available to guests able to use specific CREDIT cards. No debit cards acceptable (no reason given, just the way it is). Therefore if you don't have (or wish to use) a credit card then the perfectly reasonable alternative of a VISA debit card is useless. This form of payment is accepted all around the world, but not by Vodafone Italy (apparently). Hotel was not interested. They should clearly state on the website that they DO NOT provide a hotel based wireless service and that this is only provided by a 3rd party accepting limited methods of payment. One could then elect to stay elsewhere! Simple! Now the staff attitude. This was horrendous! Arrogant and ignorant comes to mind! I asked for the name and/or email address of the General Manager. Apparently I was not entitled to this information. All complaints had to be raised via duty manager who would pass the matter on. Obviously the General Manager in this hotel is far too grand to deal with the \"common\" customer! How pathetic! Breakfast time and not one member of staff could be found in the breakfast area! When one eventually turned up she was most upset that a customer who had been waiting nearly 15 minutes was annoyed! Checkout was equally a pantomime! The Duty Manager who was manning the reception (only member of staff on reception incidentally) was most 'anxious' to announce quite loudly that my payment card was \"NOT GOOD\". Apparently he had tried to charge it for the full stay and incidentals 2 hours earlier that morning (without me first checking the bill). Supposedly it was declined! I gave him the exact same card and, surprise surprise, it was absolutely fine! The point here being that this supposed experienced member of staff was content to state a customer's card was being declined in the sight and hearing of other customers, and not to deal with the matter discreetly. I should say that for getting into Venice itself the hotel provides a shuttle service several times daily. This must be pre booked and costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8. The service was actually quite efficient. Gold/Platinum members of Priority Club should expect ABSOLUTELY NOTHING by way of recognition from this property. Overall this is not a suitable property if location is important. Also, those not willing to accept the \"Fawlty Towers\" style service should really look elsewhere.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgood location\u201d", "Author": "PML2011", "ReviewID": "UR119924545", "Content": "Clean, great location, great Value..

Room was very clean and met our needs fine. Breakfast was 11 euro's each, but with a great selection and kids eating free it was well worth it, filled us up for a days sightseeing. Dinner looked pricey, so we never ate at the hotel, prefering to look for the pizzeria (Pizerria - Restorante Al Calesse) mentioned in previous reviews which we though was excellent value, especially in Venice (36 Euro's for two huge pizza's, a bottle of wine, a soft drink and a dessert).

We were delayed by an airline strike for 2 nights in Venice, and the airline put us at this hotel, so I won't complain about quality in general. If I was looking for a budget hotel not on the island of Venice but to commute daily for the sites, it is probably well worth it. They have a shuttle for 8 euro a person all day long that can take you right into the city, and looking back if we hadn't gotten such a good deal on our city-hotel, this would have been a good alternative. But at every instance the men and women working for the hotel at the counter were at best clueless and unhelpful, and in the worst case, a women who may have been a manager, was downright rude. I'm not picky about these things too much now that I have lived in the UK for almost 2 years and have become accustomed to being ignored by service providers for hours on end while I want to do nothing more than pay for my coffee, but shrill, abrupt and almost angry rudeness is above the line, especially when it's your job it be literally hospitable.

Bring your own amenities as all they have in the bathroom is a 'cream wash\" but the rooms are nice, comfortable and clean. Normally we never eat in hotels for breakfast because they are usually rip-offs, but ours was included in what the airline paid for, and I would in fact pay that myself for what we got.

I could have happily eaten there for lunch as well. Moral of the story: eat a huge breakfast, avoid the staff, and this may be a really good way to avoid paying twice as much for a tiny room on the outskirts of the islands where it would take you just as long to walk to the sights as the bus ride from this hotel.

Great Stay\u201d", "Author": "GurgaonBased", "ReviewID": "UR44447473", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights in Sept 2009. It was a great stay and I would recommend everyone to stay in this hotel. My reasons are as follows: 1. the main city of Venice does not have any taxis or buses or even cars. All public transportation ends at the main bus/ train station and you have to take the water taxi from there to your hotel. These are VERY VERY expensive. A private one could casily cost upwards of EUR 60 for 2 persons with 2 suitcases and the public one is so full that you wont get place even to stand [and it still costs EUR 6.5 per person one way]. So if your hotel is in the main city, you will need to take a watertaxi to some where close to the hotel and then lug the suitcase around and find the hotel on foot. Its not simple when you realise that the street numbers etc are missing/ difficult to find! So it is preferable to stay outside the main city so that you can easily reach by bus or cab. 2. This hotel is pretty well connected by bus and cab. We came from Switzerland and came to the Mestre railway station [one stop before the main railway station] and rang up the hotel to ask for directions. The english speaking person who answered the phone, advised us to buy bus tickets to the bus stop near the hotel from where it was 10 min walk. The cost was EUR 1.1 per person. 3. We never took the hotel's coach to the city. the bus stop was just a 10 min walk away and return tickets were available at the tobacco shop at the bus stand. 4.The hotel itself seems to be a 3 star hotel. The staff was OK.... not very forthcoming but was helpful enough and gave the correct directions etc. Probably it was a language thing. 5. The rooms were fine/ clean/ large/ airconditioned with an electronic safe and the breakfast was also a reasonably large spread. However they impose the rule about not taking anything from the breakfast table with you for eating later [not even an apple]. 6. Since you are staying outside the main city, the cost is also much lower. I think our stay cost about EUR 180 for 2 persons for 2 nights. Booked on the Holiday inn site. I think it was a great deal. You spend much lower on the hotel and travel to the city is just 30 min away [including time spent in walking to the bus stop] @ EUR 2.2 for a return ticket. 7. Because of some shopping, we took the cab back to the Mestre railway station. It cost us EUR 14 during peak hours [9 AM]", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cClean Modern Hotel Outside of the City\u201d", "Author": "msm", "ReviewID": "UR42769823", "Content": "Convenient to public transportation to commute to/from Venice, the Holiday Inn has clean, spacious and modern rooms. We only stayed one night after a 12 day cruise. We were disappointed that the hotel's shuttle bus was booked from 9am (when we arrived) to the mid-afternoon. We couldn't wait 6 hours or we would have lost most of our tour time. The staff told us how to take the public bus to Venice. We don't speak Italian but managed to get to Venice easily. It didn't go as well on the way home. We couldn't find the right stop on the way home and bus drivers weren't able to help us. We finally rode back to Venice on the bus and got a cab. We didn't use hotel facilities such as restaurants so can't speak to those. The hotel is only a 25 Euro cab ride from the cruise ship port, much cheaper than most cruise shuttle prices. There is a gas station right next to the hotel. You can buy a limited number of snack items there. Many people have commented on staff rudeness but the front desk was very helpful to us. If you take a cab to the airport, set the fare in advance. We think we got cheated by a cab driver who didn't turn on the meter.

The hotel was difficult to find as we were not given clear directions as to which bus stop we should go to in order to take the bus from the train station. The worst part is that on a weekend we could not buy tickets to ride the bus as all the Tobbacco shops and newspaper stands were closed - worst is that we could not even find Taxis either. After some walking we finally found the correct bus stop. We tried paying for the bus fare directly to the driver, but he basically just ignored us - We essentially got a free ride. After getting off at the stop indicated by the hotel we were basically in the middle of a residential area with a few stores, but they were all closed b/c of the weekend. The walk is actually far specially if you have luggage. The hotel was clean and it was basically a standard Holiday Inn. Like the previous reviewer mentioned, the hotel is far from Venice and the only easy way to get to Venice is by Shuttle that will cost you 7EU round trip per person. In comparison, a train ride only cost 2EU round trip per person from Mestre to Venice. You can potentially take a bus, but the bus stop is quite far from the hotel. The breakfast menu is decent, but will set you back 11EU per person - for the breakfast buffet. Did not have any other meal at the hotel so I can't comment on the rest. The hotel staff gave contradicting answers regarding how to go to the airport. The first person told us to take the bus, but after I walked to the bus stop (different from the one that we arrived) I quickly realized that this is not an option for us w/ luggage. The second person told us to just take a taxi and that it should not cost more than 25EU. On the day that we left I asked front desk to call me a taxi, which they promptly did. When I tried to confirm that it should only cost me 25EU to the airport he gave me a puzzled look and said that it should be about 35EU w/ no traffic.
