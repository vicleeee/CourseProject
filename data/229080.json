Breakfast was good and we found all the staff very friendly and accommodating. The hotel is located on the Lido and across the water from the centre of Venice but we had booked the Water Taxi from the airport to make life easier, then had the 72 hour pass for the water buses which also includes the local bus. The Lido has a long sandy beach which I am sure would be lovely in the summer but was the wrong time of year for us to use.

The hotel itself is beautiful. Our room was charming. Breakfast and cappucinos were delicious. Bikes are available to use. The hotel staff that we dealt with were mostly unpleasant, impatient and a few even rude. One of the older male staff complained when I attempted to read the contract they asked me to sign, saying \"nobody in 40 years has ever read through this\". I felt like I was greatly inconveniencing him for the entire 1 min. spent reading it. One night when my husband went to bed early, I decided to get some dessert in the outside patio area, which was beautiful. It was quite empty out there. I asked for a table so I could enjoy some dessert and a much older man exclaimed that I would have to sit at the inside bar and that I was not allowed to sit outside for a mere dessert. There were at least 20 empty tables and maybe 1 or 2 other guests outside and it was fairly late. He wanted me to go to the bar? I would have felt like I was waiting for someone to pick me up! I'm an attractive lady and I would have not felt comfortable sitting at the bar. Then, when we were checking out, the hotel completely overcharged us for just about everything. Look at your bills closely prior to paying! They overcharged our hotel room 60 EUR a night, charged 12 EUR for a cappucino and americano that should have been included in our breakfast and 53 EUR for 2 desserts + 3 bar drinks. Additional charges on top of this too.

When I rang the hotel from the UK they told me to get the BLUE line, which stops at the Lideo (SME) - which is a good 20/25 min walk with luggage - or get a taxi. The reception staff are not friendly nor informative. When I asked for the location of a nearest supermarket, the reply was vague and not specific - poor show. The room was small, dark and cramped. The hotel grounds where unkempt and furniture was past it's best. The atmosphere felt unwelcoming and we never saw anyone in the bar. It appears everyone just used this as a base.

Quattro Fontane Hotel is located in a quiet and peaceful spot but just a gentle stroll away from the beach and about a 20 minute walk to the Lido waterbus which takes you in to beautiful Venice in about 10 minutes. A great spot to enjoy the relative peace and quiet of the Lido and the busy and stunningly beautiful Venice. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Most of the staff were great too. The only negatives were that the beds were narrow and quite uncomfortable and the drinks at the bar were expensive, almost twice the price of a local, more grander hotel we found in the Lido. In the twin room we had, the beds were positioned awkwardly and from one bed you couldn't see the telly due to a huge pillar in the middle of the room. That didn't bother though as there's so much to do in the Lido and Venice, very little time was spent in the room. All in all a lovely place to stay, in a great location.

We tried this hotel and were concerned about not being on the main island but it is only a 15 min. boat ride from St Marks Square on the main vaporetto(boat bus). Tne hotel recommended that we take a taxi from the marina to the hotel ( a 20 min walk) which was definitely worth it, but it was 12 euro for a 5 min ride. Welcome to Venice! After that we either walked or took the bus. Yes, there are cars and buses on Venice Lido. The beach(lido) is a 5 min walk from the hotel and is a nice view. We didn't try the beach but have read that it is dirty - it looked ok to us. I think if we returned I would rent bikes and explore the rest of the island. Our rooms were in a seperate building from the main hotel, but just a few steps away. The rooms were a good size and clean. The decor is very old world and there is alot of eccentric artwork throughout. There are quite a few sitting rooms throughout the hotel and a large outdoor dining area for breakfast and another area outside for dinner along with a garden area where you could sit and visit or read a book and have something to drink. One morning we did exactly that, it was a nice change from all the sightseeing. The breakfast was the best we had all vacation! The cappucinos were wonderful! The woman who served breakfast was quick and extremely nice(we didn't get her name). She also served at dinner as well - not sure if she was the manager of the restaurant as it seemed she was there all of the time - extremely hard working. The food at dinner was very good and we had a charming older gentleman for our waiter. He seemed a little confused but he was so sweet. We sat under a beautiful 300 year old tree at dinner. They have bug zappers for all of the mosquitos which was welcoming since we got bit really bad when we were in Rome. One day a young woman at the front desk offered us a boat ride to Murano for 10 euro each and the next day Massimo offered us a free private boat taxi to Murano and Burano which we took. Very high pressure at the lace store in Burano, but we left and took the public transportation to Venice from there. Burano is beautiful and at Murano you could only go into one of the factories....granted it was huge, but I would have liked to have seen more factories and more of the island. Definitely buy the pass for public boat buses for the length of your stay. It was 33 euro each for 72 hours and I think it is something like 6 euro one way for under 2 hours.

The bath in our annexe bedroom was extremely narrow and worn with a very rough enamel surface. The surrounding area had worn paint work that needed a make over. A flexible shower hose was connected but it was impossible to have a stand up shower as there wasn't a shower enclosure.

The menu is frightfully expensive and very limited as is the charge to use the beach. 71 Euro per day for a cabin and chairs is absolute extortion ,especially on top of the substantial charge for staying in the Quattro Fontane . We ate once in the restaurant on arrival and were served by an extremely old waiter who literally chucked the cutlery and napkins in front of us. The service took forever. Please note that the Lido's greatest asset is the shell beaches. They are a complete disgrace and very dangerous, littered with great heaps of wooden flotsum and industrial detritus swept in from the sea. Huge whole trees had been washed up and were either teathered to poles in the water or left on the water margin. I have only ever seen such a mess on one other beach in Mexico.
