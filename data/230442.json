Stayed at the Boulevard from the 25th Oct -28th october. Booked it through my travel agent here for EUR 83 . The hotel was great value, superb location and I really enjoyed my stay here. Here are my views in favour of the hotel and not in favour of..In favour:-Superb location, walking distance from the Zoo Station ( 10 minutes),on the main shopping road where everything is just 2 minutes walk away. Karstadt the department store is opposite and the upmarket KA A VE is just 5 minutes away. Its right next to Kaiser Wilhelm memorial with lots of food stalls around, so no problem absolutely for food.-The hop on hop off tours bus starts right in front of the hotel-Very comfortable rooms, very good toilet, and absolutely nothing to complain about. Tv, safe and minibar in the rooms. -very polite staff at the reception. My tv and safe were not working initially, and they had it fixed by the time I returned from my tour without a second reminder.-Housekeeping services were commendable-great breakfast, no compalints here too.-There is a One Euro shop on the road behind the hotel, just beside the Kaiser Wilhelm memorial with some good buys, I got a couple of red and white italian wines for just a Euro ! A very good Chinese takeway too nearby with a large portion of chicken fried rice or noodles for Eur 2.50 each.Not in favour....-the very slow moving lift, and a tiny one at that-very soft pillows...but except for the minor hickups, I think this is a great value hotel in a superb location !!!!!!An oh, Berlin is a fabulous city. The best amongst all of those I visited - Frankfurt, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Bonn and Munich.... I fel 3 days just wasnt enough to see the sights...", "Date": "Nov 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR256601515", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "vinn_2k"}, {"Content": "Boulevard Hotel - you're welcome We recently stayed in the Hotel Boulevard, Berlin for 1 week. The location is brilliant. For transport, it is near to the Zoo train station, bus stops, and underground. The hotel is very clean and comfortable. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. They arranged transport for us and even set out a special breakfast table when it was my wifes birthday.The reception, breakfast room, and bar are situated on the 6th floor. They offer an excellent buffet breakfast which sets you up for the day. When you return from your day out, you can sit out on the rooftop terrace and have a pleasant drink and look down over the square at Kaiser Willhelm church.Our room was on the 2nd floor at the front of the hotel. The room was very spacious and was kept very clean by the hotel.The beds were very comfortable. There was a stocked minibar and security safe in the room.When we return to Berlin (because you cannot see it all in 1 week) we will definitely stay at this hotel again.
