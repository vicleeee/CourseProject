Its a small room with a big bed and very decent. Safe was useful for sense of security. Always appreciate a kettle in the room. Overall, in march at 60 odd euros, good value.

Tabacchi which sell bus tickets do not stock the 3-day all-in tickets which at 11euros are the best value. You need to go to a train or metro station for these. Breakfast is not inspiring - we found the fresh Greek yoghourt in ice the best bet, with a honey portion. The toasters are efficient once you get the hang of their old-fashioned design.

A normal taxi from the airport was like 70\u20ac to the hotel, so when I left I used hotels own airport-taxi which cost 45\u20ac. I'd suggest using that if you want an easy transportation.

Every day going out and coming back we found a smile waiting for us..that helped us to feel home. All were wonderful and always ready to help us in all our request. Thank you so much to the tall man with glasses,to Naoemi,to the asiatic guy to all the staff in the breakfast room and to the manager , We cannot remember her name but she was a nice girl very professional with a beautiful white doggy that we loved.

But the problem was that our room (no. 110) was on the ground floor next to a kitchen, which is crazy for a room they are offering as a family room. We were kept awake with noises from the reception area etc and early as 6am with clatterings from the kitchen. The kitchen staff seemed to have no thought that the room was next door. We complained and were told that the only other room would be just as noisy due to traffic. We were not offered a refund or discount. I would NOT stay here again and reccomend others to avoid.

Like all hotels, there are some things that are less than perfect, and the Panama Garden is no exception. On the plus side we thought the staff were very friendly and helpful. We never came across any member of staff who was too busy to help or seemed surly. The location is out of the centre, but once you get to know the area, we were pleased to get away from the madness of central Rome. The walk across the Borghese park is fantastic and we often choose to walk back rather than get a bus or tram. Having said that make sure you pick up a bus route map, because without it, you will get confused. The bedroom was very clean and comfortable, and spacious enough for us. We got to the hotel via the airport bus and then local bus 86, which was fine. (But we booked a car back to the airport for \u20ac45 which I think was good value and made life a lot easier). On the negative side, the shower cubicle leaked and this was a bit annoying until I figured out how to plug the gap in the screen. And the shower head had seen better days. But there was also a bath which worked fine. The room suffered a bit from road noise, but I doubt that you could find anywhere in Rome that doesn't have some road noise. And living in deepest sussex, we are a bit spoilt. Finally we thought the breakfast suffered a bit due to the poor quality bread rolls they provide. If you have a sweet tooth you will probably be very happy, but we like a savoury breakfast that can sustain us for a few hours to lunch and we had some really beautiful bread when eating out so it was disappointing to see tiny tasteless rolls on the breakfast table. I would certainly stay at this hotel again and am happy to recommend it.

I'd be lying if I said that the hotel was anything other than basic (but very clean) in terms of comfort and general exterior/interior and it's a fair way from the city centre. But it really all depends on what you are after from a hotel. I was very happy to be situated half an hour's walk from the city with a LOVELY walk through the beautiful park that is Villa Borghese every day. I loved starting and ending my days here away from the hustle and bustle of the main tourst attaractions. I didn't actually get on one bus the whole time I stayed as I just didn't want to miss out on my peaceful walk through the park! The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was nothing short of 5 star. I had read a couple of reviews on this site about asking for a room with a terrace but as I had only paid a very basic rate on an internet deal and I'd only read this the night before travelling, I didn't really hold out much hope. However, I was very pleasantly surprised on arrival that the lovely Naomi had gone out of her way to get me a terrace. Ideal for resting the weary legs with a nice glass of wine and watching the sun go down at night or having breakfast before heading off in the morning. The staff were also very helpful in looking into tours for me before I came out and I was looking for something a little more unusual than the average as I had already been to Rome before. Again, Naomi was very patient and looked into a number of different options for me. Room service was a bit hit and miss. If I had one criticism it would be this. I suppose that most people that come to Rome come as a couple and spend their evenings at restaurants but as I was travelling on my own I spent 2 nights in the hotel and although there is a bar menu it is very limited and on the second night I was told that there was nothing at all to eat!! And this was only at 8pm!! This was a bit of a worrry as there is very little nearby in terms of restaurants. But the staff being as lovely as they are managed to rustle me something up in the end which suited me fine. All in all, I would recommend this hotel mainly because I felt like more of a local than a tourist! The hotel felt a bit more like a home than some faceless luxury hotels and I felt like I'd become best friends with the owners of the local pizzeria by the end of my stay! Go for it if you are looking for great value for money in a city that it seriously expensive (and this is coming from a Londoner!) Room Tip: Ask for a terrace! There's no additional cost but it makes a whole big difference to your stay! See more room tips Stayed August 2011, travelled solo Value Location Rooms Service Less Was this review helpful?

The hotel is clean and pleasant enough but has enough negatives that we will not use the hotel again. Firstly, the Hotels website lists many inclusive items that just don't exist. I could name them all but they are too numerous to list. The biggest complaint of what is not in the room was a coffee/tea maker. I haven't stayed in a hotel in years that did not include a coffee/tea maker in their rooms. The refrigerator in the room did not work either. This seemed to be a problem in other rooms because I heard others complain of the same thing at the front desk. Also the heat in the room could not be turned on in the daytime. They must have a central control on it because I could get no heat till 5pm. Also we could not get a cup of tea after 10:30pm at night. After walking in the cold all day and evening my husband and I asked the girl at the front desk if we could get a cup of tea. She curtly snapped \"Bar is closed\" and could have cared less. The dark haired girl on the front desk was very rude the entire time we stayed. We were not the only ones that found her to be. On Christmas Eve we asked for her help in getting transportation to the Vatican for midnight Mass. This dark haired girl flat out lied to us telling us there were no taxis or buses but if we left immediately we could get a trolley (this was at 9:30 pm). We hurried the 5 blocks to the trolley station only to find out all public transportation stopped at 7pm. Luckily a nearby hotel secured us a taxi. I wish I knew the name of that hotel because I would recommend it. Our entire stay we could not get the front desk to help us at all. When we inquired to the front desk where we could have a Christmas Day dinner we were told that everything was closed and we could go downtown and try to locate something ourselves on the day. They made no attempt to try to secure reservations for their guests. We ended up at a very poor Chinese Restaurant with two others from our Hotel also there. The internet that they say they provide access to is located behind their front desk. You would never know it was there unless you asked. When I asked for it I was told I could use it if only for a few minutes. It is a very uncomfortable place to check and send email. The rooms are so small that you cannot move around in them. Other couples there at the time asked for an upgrade but were told they could not have one. The rooms are clean but that is about all. You could spend no time in them because you would go stir crazy. The breakfast is okay if all you want is pastry.But the guy that worked the breakfast room in the morning is the grouchiest man I have ever seen. Asking for a second pot of coffee was met with such a fuss that I hated asking. He did not want to be there obviously. This hotel is very far from City Centre. You have to take a bus. Ada Park can't be seen from the hotel because there is a tall wall all around it. Be careful when walking the streets near the hotel. We constantly dodged Dog waste. Obviously no one picks up after their dog. I could go on and on but I think you get the idea about this hotel. The only thing good was we only paid 325 euro total for six nights.

The en suite bedrooms are nicely furnished, contain tv and mini-bar and are cleaned on a daily basis. We tried two rooms, as the one we were provided with on arrival we deemed too cramped for a week's holiday (but fine for a shorter stay). The staff very helpfully showed us other rooms and let us move to a wonderfully spacious room overlooking the Villa Ada opposite the hotel. We did have to pay an upgrade for this bigger room, but it was definitely worth it for the added luxury - the fully-functioning air-con system and nice powerful shower made it a great place to come back to at the end of a hard day's shopping/sightseeing. The breakfast room was nice and spacious, offering indoor and outdoor tables. Breakfast itself was great - nice coffee and a wide selection of pastries, cereals, bread rolls, jams and fruit, all of which are kept well-stocked until the last person has had their fill. Also, breakfast is served between 06.30 and 10.30, offering the chance of a good meal before an early start, whilst allowing others to have a nice lie-in! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to others.", "Date": "September 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "scarborough,england", "Title": "\u201cA real find!\u201d", "Author": "darrell", "ReviewID": "UR3846008", "Content": "We stayed here 29/08/05 for 4 days.

Some reviews mentioned that it was a long walk to the bus stop but it is about 200/300 yards at most and buses run every few minutes. The area is especially nice, with a beautiful park just opposite and the wonderful Catacombs of St. Pricilla just up the road ( about 5 mins steady walk).

The hotel is in an upper middle class neighborhood of Rome. The lobby has a cool Italian 60's chic about it; you half expect to catch a glimpse of Anita Ekberg strolling by (in fact, as the photo informed us, Brigitte Bardot stayed there in 1960). The breakfast was the very best of four hotels I'd experienced, served on a charming plant-lined patio. Room and bath were very clean; bathroom newly updated. The staff was reasonably helpful. The hotel is not centrally located, despite what the website claims. In fact, it's in one of Rome's more remote sections. Five minutes to the busstop, and a lengthy ride to the historic center (seemingly longer to St. Peter's). The hotel is undergoing refurbishing, and the workers were in the hallways, plaster all about them, dropcloths spread everywhere. I understand the need for updates, but where the guests walk, during peak tourist season? The room was small; the bed was too soft. Above the door, the wallpaper was clearly stained in many spots. The bathroom door locked automatically from the inside, and could then only be opened from the bedroom. The room's lights flickered dramatically whenever the main door was opened or closed. No curtains in the bathroom; blinds impossible to move.

The location was great- we walked all over the city from this central spot The rooms were immaculate and well appointed. The breakfast area is big with a beautiful garden and the food was good.

The room was dark, small, the bed was barely a full size, and overall depressing. We complained nicely to the front desk, and explained that for the amount of money we were paying, we were disappointed and asked for another room. They were full, but let us change rooms anyway, since not everyone had checked in. The new room was much better, but still not quite worth the money, in my opinion. It was small but the bathroom was nice--even had a tub with a shower--but the room seemed a bit on the old side--peeling wallpaper, etc. The staff made up for the not so great rooms, and was very helpful and friendly.
