After work I stayed on for the weekend and my husband flew out to join me. I wouldn't choose it as a location for the tourist part of the city, but as I was already there it wasn't too bad for the old town and therefore easier to stay put than to check out and relocate for the last two nights. GOOD STUFF The rooms were a nice size - I got to try two different rooms and they were both good. The corner rooms are biggest. Beds are very comfortable. The bathroom was a reasonable size, there was good power on the shower and also a decent hairdryer. Each room includes a kettle with some coffee, tea and UHT milk. There is space in the fridge \"For guests\", which is handy. (I know you can just move the minibar stuff out of you want to use the fridge, but I appreciated the touch of making space ready for my own-bought drink). The rooftop pool is marvellous. It may not be huge, but is was never crowded when I went there and the cool water is such a win in the summer heat. The decking is nice and there are shady and sunny spaces available. You can pick up towels from the gym as you walk through it on your way to the roof. The gym equipment was reasonable - two running machines, two cross trainers, two bikes (One upright, one sit back), a rowing machine, free weights and one of the pulley-weight things. Lots of mirrors, which make it feel more spacious, towels and chilled water. There are a couple of tellys and I usually found it fairly empty meaning that I could turn the telly off and just listen to my own MP3. It's just a couple of minute's walk to the Metro and a short journey to the old town, so you can easily enjoy the best parts of Madrid after a day at work. The Metro is EUR1 each way, and if you really can't be bothered with it, a taxi is only EUR10 each way. NOT SO GOOD STUFF The gym doesn't seem to have aircon. The control is there, but it won't switch on and that is no joke in the midsummer heat. Especially when there is a fantastic gym on the ground floor, with dozens of machines and called \"Holiday Gym\". It's branded like it comes with the hotel, but they are pretty quick to tell you that you can't use it. There are no in-room safes from floor 4 downwards, so I recommend that you request a higher floor. They didn't tell me that this was the case when I checked in, but when I commented to my colleague, who had come over from Munich, that I was fed up with lugging all my valuables around, she said that her room had a safe and so I requested a change. That was when reception admitted that the lower floors had no safes. They seemed almost surprised that I wanted to change rooms to get a safe, but since they clearly state in their book that they won't accept liability for stuff left in your room, I don't see why they would think that I should take a punt. I moved to floor 8, which I liked because I could easily take the stairs to the gym on floor 9 or the pool on floor 10. The staff weren't terribly helpful. Normally anywhere with free wi-fi asks you if you want the code when you check in. The next morning when I realised I didn't have the log in code, I asked for it at reception and was informed that it wasn't free and she mentioned a fee of (I think) EUR6 per hour. That's more then I'm prepared to pay for a measly hour - it's cheaper to use my data roaming, despite my phone company being rip off merchants. Plus there is free wi-fi all over Madrid - on the Metro for a start - so why should I pay for it at my hotel? I have already paid business rates to be there. I did hear someone else being told by a different receptionist that you got an hour's free wi-fi a day, but by that time I'd located the hot spots and couldn't be a...d with their reception anymore. The rooms keys seem to fail regularly. To start with they said that my card was fine and that it was a problem with the room lock. When I changed rooms, I had the same problem, which they assured me was a result of my having a mobile phone (Surely everyone has a mobile phone?!) My husband joined me for the weekend and once we had two cards, we found that one worked and one didn't (despite being kept together), so I think that the problem was with the cards and I don't know why they kept saying that it wasn't. When I spoke to reception about mine, they always re-set it and it always worked afterwards. Overall, they certainly weren't rude, but they also weren't welcoming or actively helpful, and this was a noticeable contrast to my last business trip to a Radisson hotel (in another city) where they went out of their way to be helpful and plesant. I don't think its a cultural thing either, since my colleagues in the Madrid office couldn't have been nicer. IMHO when you travel on business, it is often in antisocial hours (e.g. I arrived at the hotel at 1.am knowing I had to meet my colleague 7am the same day), you are often on your own and just want the hotel experience to be easy. I have visited 6 different countries so far this year and with the best will in the world, I can't speak the local language everywhere I go. I don't need to be given a hard time by the reception staff if I can't muster up much more than \"hola\" at 1 in the morning. (Sorry sidetracking a bit there!) The decor is pretty tired and there was a small patch of mould on the shower curtain in my second room (I hate shower curtains - you just know that they never get cleaned!). Apparently all HI hotels are being renovated, so maybe they will put air-con in the gym, fit safes in all the rooms and replace the wallpaper, which is dangerously close to anaglypta! They only give you one towel per person, like no-one ever washes their hair and body at the same time. I took extra towels back from the gym to redress this. They don't provide a flannel either. I also used the gym water supply to top up my water bottle, since water from the mini bar was Eur4.50. 4.50!! And yet you can buy a litre for Eur3 from room service - bizarre. I ordered a burger from room service and it wasn't very nice. That'll teach me to choose junk food! Breakfast is EUR20, which in fairness to them is typical for city hotels, but still a complete rip off if you just want something light to start the day - it's never an option to pay EUR2 for a coffee and a croissant (or similar), despite the fact that this is exactly what it will cost you if you walk to a cafe such as Jamon Jamon, about 2 minutes away from the Holiday Inn (Its on the gound floor of the building with \"Allianz\" on the roof. As a regular business traveller I wasn't very impressed with this hotel, but the roof-top pool just about swung it for me so in view of the convenience, I will go back.

As a member of the Intercontinental Hotels Group Priority Club, it was a no-brainer to stay here as for 4 nights, I only had to shell out 107 Euros along with some of my Priority Club points. The hotel is situated in the northern part of the city, close to the Santiago Bernabau football stadium, in what can best be described as a commercial area. The hotel is within a couple of minutes walk of a Metro Station, and it's only a couple of Metro stops back into the main city centre attractions. The Metro is cheap and easy to use, so getting to and from the hotel is a breeze. Later at night, when the Metro is either closed or you want to see the city at night from above ground, taxis are cheap and plentiful. From the city centre to the hotel only takes 10 minutes and will cost you less than 10 Euros. Reception was friendly and efficient, and on arrival we were upgraded to a \"suite\" without asking. Our suite was clean and functional, but was a bit tired looking. This is probably a reflection of the age of the hotel - it really does need a bit of a make-over. That being said, for a city break my wife and I didn't spend any amount of time in the hotel - Madrid has such a lot to see and experience, there really is no need for a \"resort\" hotel in such a great city. Our deal excluded breakfast, and as it's fairly expensive in the hotel, we resorted to using a local bar (20 metres from the hotel) and cafes within the adjacent shopping centre. Breakfast can be had at these places for a fraction of the price of the hotel breakfast, although I'm sure the hotel has a greater choice. The location of the hotel isn't obvious when you leave the Metro station, but walk west on the main road from the football stadium and look up - you can't miss the green Holiday Inn sign on the roof of the hotel.

To check the time, I had to keep changing the television channel. Not exactly catastrophic, just annoying. While we're on the subject of television... Do not expect to find any channels in English. Every single one -- including CNN! -- ran Spanish-language programming. I kind of got a kick out of watching Spongebob Squarepants (or, rather Bob Esponja) speak Spanish, but it definitely got old after a while. This was actually the first time I'd been overseas and couldn't find at least one channel in English. Not sure what that's about... The \"fitness center\" offers the bare minimum in the way of exercise equipment. Luckily, there was never really anyone else in there with me, so I didn't have to wait for any machine. The food was fine, as were the drinks, but I couldn't understand why ordering drinks through room service was cheaper than getting them at the bar. Since no one delivering my orders spoke English, there was no way for me to ask. One thing that got under my skin was the staff's insistence that I charge everything (food, drinks, Internet fees, etc) to my room. They kept saying that it was \"easier\" for them when I didn't use cash. If someone can explain that one to me, please do. All in all, I had a great time. The hotel is in a great location, with a mall right in the same plaza.

We were in Madrid for a vacation and stayed 6 nights at the hotel. It is very clean and the service is excellent. I highly commend the front desk staff for excellent English, willingness to help and give information. It is \"not close\" to the downtown and tourist attractions. Pubic transportation is excellent in Madid and safe. Bus 27 takes you from near the hotel, the stop is about a block away, to the Prado. Metro #10 takes you to the Puerto del Sol. Both are reliable and cheap. If you take the local train from the airport to the Nuevo Ministeries Stop, either take the metro on to to the next stop at the hotel, or just invest in a short cab ride. I do not recommend the walk to the hotel with luggage. Several American style fast food restaurants are close to the hotel, McDonalds and Burger King for example. Try the Ristoranti La Tagliatella in the evening, it opens at 8:30 PM for great pizza and pasta. It is practically next door. A Corte Ingles is within walking distance and has a great supermarket and deli in the basement. Rooms are much bigger than most hotel rooms in Europe and up-to-date. You even get a kettle to make hot tea and coffee. That is not found in many hotels in Spain. Recommend the hotel inspite of the few drawbacks.

A quiet room in one of the very few quiet areas of Madrid.\u201d", "Author": "Pinky_and_Brain", "ReviewID": "UR22881787", "Content": "The Holiday Inn Madrid is THE place to be if you are struggling to find a quiet area to sleep at night without complaints about outside noise. Madrid is a very noisy city 24 hours a day, almost anywhere you stay.....and you'll be hard pressed to find other quiet alternatives elsewhere in the city, with the same excellent transport connections as this hotel, LOCATION: -Do not let the non-central location of this hotel put you off.....rather than being a negative aspect it is actually the best thing about this place ! - Located between towers \"Torre Europa\" by Plaza de Lima and \"Torre Picasso\" in the north part of Madrid, this is a predominantly business, governmental & residential area of the city. The most amazing thing is that this area is mostly quiet day AND night. For Madrid, that is a rare thing ! -Staying here you will be away from the city centre and most tourist sites but you can reach all of these within 10 minutes by metro (underground, subway). The hotel is a 1 to 3 min walk to \"Nuevos Ministerios\" metro station and to the \"Santiago Bernabeu\" metro station (line 10, dark blue colour). The metro is modern, efficient and will take you anywhere you want (Prado museum, King's palace, main train and bus stations) in no time at all. The metro runs till 1.30 past midnight. -The \"Nuevos Ministerios\" station has 3 metro lines passing through it...line 10, line 6 and most importantly line 8 which connects directly to Barajas airport. Due to this good link a lot of airline staff (flight attendants and pilots) use this hotel. -Hotel is also close to: Santiago Bernab\u00e9u football (soccer) stadium (home of Real Madrid) Large branch of \"El Corte Ingles\" shopping complex Residential area near \"Calle de Orense\" street with shops, ATM's (cash machines) & restaurants. Try the Argentine restaurant near \"Torre Picasso\" Spanish governmental ministries of Economy, Science and Defence and others \"Palacio de Congresos y Exposiciones\" Bus lines going into the city ROOM: -Clean and modern in the usual holiday inn standard decor. Good size for European expectations. Room was warm in winter. The full length 70's style triangle shaped windows can give you a bit of vertigo if you are on a high floor. -Bathroom was also sufficient in size. Included a bidet and bathtub.... but the shower curtain should be a no-no in a 4 star hotel There was a slight sewage smell from the bathroom which was fixed after we complained. -Free \"Economist\" magazine in room and free newspapers at reception and gym -Each evening the hotel staff left a small card on the bed with the next day's weather forecast....I thought this was a really nice and interesting touch. EXTERIOR & COMMON AREAS: -The holiday Inn Madrid is a huge, grey, concrete, odd-shaped, 1970's dinosaur of a building. Don't worry as inside the hotel everything is very modern, clean and in good working order. -There is a rooftop pool which is open in warm times of the year (but not in winter)....great for getting some sun, rest and relaxation. -Fitness area has limited choice of equipment, 2 small saunas (one for men and the other for women) and a very small hot-tub (Jacuzzi, whirlpool). Apart from the fact that it was too small for more than 3 or 4 people sitting closely together, the paint coating in the whirlpool was coming off. -The lobby has a bar which serves reasonably priced cocktails... STAFF: -Mostly helpful and friendly BREAKFAST: -Check if your booking includes breakfast....ours didn't and the hotel wanted a whopping 22 Euro per person to eat at the buffet....we gave it a miss...Go to the cafes downtown or get the bargain \"menu del dia\" lunch deals in town for around 10 Euro (usually includes drink and dessert in the price). INTERNET ACCESS: Business centre with a few computers in the lobby...but you have to pay high prices... OVERALL PRICE: We paid 69 Euro a night without breakfast, which compared to other hotels in Madrid, is an absolute bargain, especially considering the fact that a quiet night's sleep is priceless in this city ! PROBLEMS: -Don't pay too much to get an executive room...there's not much that differs from the normal rooms. -The hotel itself and its entrance can be hard to find the first time you arrive (despite the hotel building being huge)...this is because it is covered by other tall buildings. When leaving the metro station head for the exits marked \"AZCA\" or \"Torre Europa\". The hotel entrance is in a small square just off \"Avenida del General Peron\". Look for an entrance to an underground garage. -I have never been at this hotel during a football (soccer) match at the nearby stadium....I wonder if it will still be as quiet, after a game.... -As a another reviewer mentioned...I wouldn't walk after nightfall through the high rise office blocks near \"Torre Picasso\" as a shortcut to get to the \"Nuevos Ministerios\" metro station....take the long way round. In the daylight hours it's fine to take the shortcut. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GENERAL TIPS ABOUT MADRID -Almost ALL hotels in Spain always will ask you to see, but not keep, your passport, identity card or driving license. (and often, but not always, anyone else staying in the room with you) -Many retailers in Spain will ask you for your passport, identity card or driving license if you pay for something with a debit or credit card.

I'm particularly careful on cleanliness of bathrooms, and never ever found another guests' hair in sink or on the floor. Staff is very always very helpfull and friendly, mostly multilingual, and no effort is too big to help you in any possible way. And if you have a Priority Club Card they make your feel 'an honoured guest'. Breakfast buffet is more then you can ever need or want to eat and evening restaurant is good quality for price. Another bonus on this hotel is the outdoors swimming pool on the roof of the hotel. As Madrid had some 7 months of 'swimming pool weather', it is a pleasant treat after a days work. Location is perfect for as well business purposes as leasure (Bernabeu stadium and Metro at 200 meter) . Also it is close to Madrid's biggest shopping centre (Corte Ingles) where you literally find everything. Plenty of excellent (as well small as fancy) restaurants in a radius of 500 meter around the hotel.

If you time your trip correctly, you might be able to see Real Madrid play socker game. Getting to downtown is very easy and takes about 20 min. I tried subway as well as bus. Just get pass for public transportation and hop on and off buses and trains as needed. There are at least 2 bus lines going to downtown from hotel. We didn't have to wait longer than 15 min. Subway appeared to be more frequent and faster. There was one almost every 5 min. Unlike in the States, there were vending machine on platforms. You could buy sodas and candy while waiting. Subway in Madrid is also the cleanest subway I've ever seen. Very clean, new and safe (comparing it to NYC, Washington DC, London, Paris, Prague, Philadelphia). Hotel also feels new. It is more fancy than the usual Holiday Inn in America. I'm a Priority Club member, so I usually stay at Holiday Inns. The staff at the front desk was bilingual and spoke fluent English.

There are lots of buses that go along this avenue. You can pay cash, provided you have change. The bus is nicer than the subway, as you can enjoy the avenue at all its length. I imagine, however, that it can be a bit inconvenient on raining days. I would warmly recommend to avoid crossing the office complex during the night, for security reasons.

Lots of choice, including pancakes, large chunks of a variety of fresh fruit, cereal, breads and pastries, eggs and bacon with fresh juice (not the fake concentrated stuff) Had a meal at the restaurant one night, food was ok, not enough choice on the menu and would recommend using local restaurants instead. Rooftop pool, sauna and whirlpool were a very welcome oasis after sight seeing all day. Pool is cold on first hit, but lovely once you are in. Location was good for us (two ladies sight seeing), far enough away from the noise of the city, but close enough that city is very accessible either by Metro, or tourist bus which we used. Also short metro ride from Barajas Airport.

Decor was modern and the bathroom was new. We ordered room service one night and the food was excellent and delivered promptly. Likewise the service at the front desk was always helpful (and they didn't mind speaking English after our pathetic attempts in Spanish). The only problem came when we checked out and they tried to charge us for the room and didn't seem to understand about the Priority Club rewards booking. That was sorted out quickly, however. I agree with the previous reviewers - the location appears to be near the CBD and not really near the historic centre of town. But the metro is a short 10 min walk away. Tip - laundry at the hotel is *very* expensive ie 5 euro per shirt. We discovered at the end of our stay a laundromat two blocks down on the street Commondant Zorita. In Sydney at the Holiday Inn Potts Point, they have a washing room with a coin operated dryer and washer. I wish that other Holiday Inn hotels would adopt this idea.

I booked the hotel a while ago, then seriously considered cancelling after ready some very poor reviews on this website - which I am now glad I ignored. The Hotel is in a good location, situated a 5 min walk from the Santiago Bernabau metro station. The metro in Madrid is superb - efficient, clean and cheap (1 euro fare from madrid airport). The nearby metro station is also great for getting into the town centre (Sol station). This is about 15 mins away and again only 1 euro. If you prefer a taxi the cost is about 6 euros and the route takes you past some interesting sights. Going back to the Hotel, the staff proved to be very helpful and friendly. It was really nice to be welcomed in the room with a complementary bottle of Rioja and fruit basket. The rooms were clean and well maintained and the hotel had a nice atmosphere, particularly the ground floor bar. I must assume that the previous reviewers visited pre refurb as it is hard to fault this Hotel as a 3/4 star city centre hotel. For the summer there is a roof top pool, this is closed from September, but you still have access to a really nice spa on the 9th floor with sauna's, gym equipment and a hot tub. The breakfast in the hotel is fantastic. For 20 euros per room you get a huge selection of fruit, pastries, cooked food, deli items, fresh pancakes the list goes on. Madrid itself is a fantastic city. At Christmas time the place is awash with beautiful lights and celebrations. There is plenty to do for a weekend break, although beware the long queues to see the palace. With our Hotel located next door to the Santiago Bernabau, we took in a tour of the football stadium, with the added bonus of seeing David Beckham and his team mates leaving on the coach for a game!!! On the Saturday evening, we dined in the football stadium restuarant overlooking the pitch, a quality restaurant, with reasonable prices providing a unique location. The hotel is also situated close to a shopping centre with a huge and very good department store (El Corte Ingles). To sum up, go enjoy Madrid for a super weekend break.

My room was smelly and without going into grim detail, there was far too much evidence of its previous occupants for my liking. The staff were so laid back they were practcally horizontal and had a casual approcah to their duties, to say the very least. To take one example: the fire alarm went off at 1am local time. This was not particularly loud for a fire alarm but sounded on all floors, as I noted as I headed down the fire escape on the outside of the building. I has been in my room talking with my partner, so we heard the alarm go off clearly enough, but some of my colleagues in other rooms who were asleep did not hear the alarm go off and slept right through it. This makes this hotel a potential death trap. When the alarm was eventually silenced, the night manager seemed to think the whole event was faintly amusing, and just shrugged his shoulders when I asked what the problem was.
