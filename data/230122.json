The biggest disadvantage would have to be the distance, about a 25/30 minute tram trip from the centre of the city which is easy to do, but nevertheless a little bit far. The neighbourhood also seemed a bit sketchy but possibly that was because there were no tourists and it seemed a bit industrial. I would recommend it to people who don't want to pay much for what is really a clean and nice hotel and don't mind making the trip out to the hotel.

They offered dry cleaning services. On our first night I payed for this service. The staff at the front desk told me that I will recieve my clean clothes the next day. I clearly specify the lady on the front desk that we were only staying for 2 nights and that I needed to be sure to receive the next day service and she told me there will be no problems.

My clothes were never delivered and the only answer I received was that the dry clean service was close at that time and I had to wait till the next day, and I was leaving the hotel at 6am the next morning. I asked for the manager and his answer was that the dry clean service was closed. I lost my clothes and the manager didn't want to cover my loss. I asked if there was any insurance to cover this incidents and he never answered. I had to engage in an unpleasant argument with this man, on which as a client I had the reason. Finally in a very hostile manner and after my tourguide intervene, the manager gave me 50 euros from his pocket and told me that that was all he can gave me for my loss.

My wife and I stayed there on outbound back to the US after exploring Europe because of its close proximity to Amsterdam Airport. We needed one day to relax before concluding our European trip.

Most of the staff was rude and unfriendly, with complete disregard of their guest. Good thing we only stayed there overnight. TRAVEL DATES: September-2009 LOCATION: Located within a ten minute cab ride to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Approximately 45 minutes to the City Center via City Tram. The residential neighborhood in the hotel vicinity doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look safe overall. Not really the type of neighborhood to take leisure walk at night. POSITIVE NOTES: Located close to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. NEGATIVE NOTES: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lived in Europe for three years; therefore, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m aware of European customer service standard. This hotel however, surpasses that standard. Customer satisfaction is NOT a priority. Surrounding neighborhood is clearly unsafe. They can tell a tourist from a mile away. No in-room safe to store our passports. Outrageous hidden charges.

It was a very unpleasant experience due to poor customer service and a very poor location. First, the customer service experience is awful to say the least. We booked a package via the hotel's own website. When we checked in, we were told we did not book a package but were paying a regular rack rate. During almost 45 mins of discussion with desk staff and manager, we were confronted with a 'No' at almost every request and a stubborn refusal to accept the facts (the desk staff admitted that our rate was the same as the 'package rate', but did not include various amenities like transport cards and breakfast as advertised) and they did not know what our package contained - the email confirmation we received and showed them just said 'Hotel Package A' with no details. Rather than make this right immediately, we had to spend 45 mins with them and ended up missing a nice dinner out as most places in Amsterdam stop serving early (usually by 21:30-22 at night). Ultimately they admitted their mistake and tried to make it right by compensating us with free drink vouchers, which they later refused to honor. Management really needs to work on training their staff to problem solve on the spot and address customer expectations better. Finally, the location was really really bad. At one time, the neighborhood was probably green and calm, but apparently they have built some 'social housing' nearby with the result that the area feels really dangerous with groups of men hanging about in the parks and in front of different shops. As an example, the hotel, in cooperation with local police department, puts out these pamphlets and neon signs to put in your car advising you to **empty** it of any contents so there won't be any smash and grab incidents while you park your overnight. No protected parking and no onsight security other than a few cameras that the - unattentive - desk staff can watch in the corner. They have apparently even installed security doors in the front lobby - the inner door will not open until the outer door is fully closed - like they install in banks and nice jewelry stores to prevent robberies. To call this location 'Amsterdam' is being generous. This is one of the far western suburbs (the Amsterdam city limit sign is about 100m from the hotel) and it takes, on a good trip, 30 mins to get to 'central' Amsterdam via tram, where most tourists are interested in going. The room was acceptably clean - but not beyond. The bed sheets had some inconspicuous tears in the corners, etc. Room was generally quiet, but staff was not conscientious enought not to slam doors, etc. in morning when starting their routine as other people have noted in their reviews.

The tram stop is about 10 minutes walk away from the hotel and it took about 25-30 minutes from the center. The area the hotel is situated in isn't *great* but it's not the worst in the world. When we arrived, the man on reception was very polite and extremely helpful, he told us how to get to Artis zoo and other attractions and sold us tram tickets, we went to our room and were pleasantly surprised. The room was very clean and functional - no frills, but no problems. The view wasn't amazing, but it was quiet, comfortable and there was a lock on the door. The first night we were there, we ate in the hotel and the food wasn't amazing so I would reccomend eating elsewhere, however it was food and it didn't kill us :-) The fact it is a distance from the center did start to get annoying on the second day as we were tired so were thinking we should have picked somewhere more central, however - we would have had to pay more money, and therefore accept there is a compromise to make.

Its is about a 10 min walk to the Tram and about a 20-25 min tram ride to Central Station . My main complaint with the hotel came on the morning we checked out . The night before , I had paid for the hotels \"Airport Shuttle \" to take my wife and I to the Airport the next morning at 10:15 . The next morning I checked out at 10 am and the guy who checked us out says to me \"The airport shuttle is waiting for you right outside \". So I check out and walk out front . No shuttle in sight. I walk back to the desk and ask where the shuttle is? He looks outside and says \"Oh no , It looks like they left\".He said another shuttle would be along soon .No shuttle after an hour wait. I had to take a cab and almost missed my flight! I did the math and the few hundred I spent on Transportation ( 2 cab rides and 7 day Tram pass = about $340 ) , I could have paid a little more for a room in Central A-dam and not had to take a cab or tram at all .

(within 1 min walk) If you take the train to Amsterdam Lelyln and change bus no. 63 to the hotel, it is cheaper and faster than you go to Central station and take tram 17. Whenever we wanna go to city centre, we can take tram 17. On day 3, we go to Rotterdam and Den Haag, we take bus no. 63 to the Amsterdam Lelyln station, and take the train to Den Haag. Again, it is faster and cheaper if you take the train from Amsterdam Lelyln station to Den Haag (35 - 40 mins) than you take the train from Central station.

Im not adverse to having to travel a bit to get to the centre, particularly given that we got a good price from hotels.com however, it would have been much better booking a hotel nearer the city. When we arrived it cost 25 euros by taxi from Central Station to the hotel. Be weary of the taxis, they tend to try and shaft you as they will either give you the option of a fixed price and no meter, or use the meter but take you on a detour around the city! One time the taxi cost us 30 euro and we were already half way to the hotel, after an argument with the taxi driver, he cut it to 15! The trams are a good way of getting round but its still pretty awkward. The tram stop is probably a 15 minute walk from the hotel, which isnt too far but it is when its very cold and windy. Particularly at night time when you have to change trams etc to get home. Its probably one of those things when you know where to go it would be easier but as we were only there a few days we didnt rally have time to understand it! The hotel is set in what can only be described as a housing estate with nothing other than a few shops nearby - only a spar!

The hotel was extremely good value as we only paid \u00c2\u00a3116 for the hotel with flights included from Expedia - what a bargain! The hotel is clean, the staff are friendly, speak excellent English and are very helpful. The room I stayed in was a non-smoking room and there were no smells of smoke in the room or corridor. The room was large, clean and had a hairdryer fitted into the bathroom. The shower was powerful and hot and the TV had many channels including MTV. Although the hotel is slightly out from the centre and there is a 15 minute walk to the tram stop then a 20 minute journey to Dam Square, it was reasonably priced and comfortable. I would prefer to stay nearer the Square next time I visit as you tend to spend a lot of time travelling to and from the hotel. I would not recommend families staying in this hotel due to the walk to the tram stop which is accessed via the side of the canal which is poorly lit and pitch black at night. However, if you want a girly (or lads) weekend this hotel is affordable, in a quiet area and Amsterdam is simply fantastic.", "Date": "January 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at Tulipn Inn Amsterdam West\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4352030", "Content": "I had a great stay at the Tulip Inn Amsterdam City West. The room was large, comparable to American hotels. Comfortable bed and clean room. The staff was polite and efficient. A simple 30 minute tram ride from the city center and a five minute walk from Hoekenes stop on the #17 tram. The location is in a quiet residential area, which is great after a long day walking through Amsterdam. I recommend this hotel and will stay here upon my return to Amsterdam.", "Date": "January 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utah", "Title": "\u201cNice and Clean Rooms at Tulip Inn City West\u201d", "Author": "skizate", "ReviewID": "UR4148120", "Content": "Great hotel, The staff was very friendly and helpful/informative. They also have passes for Tramlines/buslines that are 13 Euros for a 72 Hour pass and small maps of surrounding area. They also offered a Airport shuttle service for 11 Euros (which is alot cheaper than 30-40 dollar cab fare from the airport) Now the room itself was modest, comparable to say a Motel 6, or Best Western Inn back here in the States. The carpet did have a large stain on it but I could have cared less. The beds were nice and warm, Bathroom was a nice size. and the maid service was efficent promintly there to clean your room by 10:30 am (lol a little to early if you party as much as i did lol) The tram station is about a 5-10min walk along a canal almost infront of the hotel. Unless you walk around and down pass the shops that takes about 15mins depending on how fast you walk. TIP.. BEWARE OF THE BIKE LANE AT NIGHT as I had a hard time distinguishing one from the other. and was almost run over numerous times by Bikers. lol Now the Location of this hotel is some what far from Centraal Station. about 20-40 mins depending on stops and tram capacity. If coming from Centraal Station just hope on the #17 goin to Osdorp or something like that. and get off at the \"Hoeknes\"(sp?) stop. It is one of the last stops. And for those of you that wonder, \"amsterdam style smoking\" or Pot smoking is tolerated just so long as you dont \"fishbowl\" or cloud up the hallways. and you keep the smoking In your room or outside the hotel lobby. I would definately come back to this hotel if staying in AMS again.", "Date": "November 28, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Amsterdam City West", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d230122-Reviews-Amsterdam_City_West-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$71 - $264*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Reimerswaalstraat 5</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1069 AE</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "230122", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/56/3b/e8/entree.jpg"}}
