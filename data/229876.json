{"Reviews": [{"Content": "An unknown gem This hotel is great.They have just finished refurbishing the whole hotel, so it's brand new!Rooms were comfortable and food, although a limited menu was very good.Location is great, too. It's only about 100 yards to the first class Gran Via Shopping Mall, with a great Supermarket, Restaurants, Movie Theater, and many boutique type shops. The Metro (Subway) runs until about midnight, buy a set of ten tickets at just over half price. There are many trains all going to and from Plaza Espana. Then you need to change trains at Plaza Espana, from where you can go anywhere in Barcelona. It's easy if you get a map!Pity they don't have a swimming pool, but then we were too busy in Barcelona to have any time to swim!", "Date": "Oct 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR516355805", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "David-Sugar-Free"}, {"Content": "Pleasantly surpised We ended up at AC Som not from choice, but because the city centre hotel we had expected to be at had double-booked our room. When we were packed off to the AC Som instead (no pool, located in a retail park outside the city centre, major roadworks outside, depressing decor with black being the main colour in our room) I felt like getting on the next flight home. However, the reception staff were really kind and helpful and the room turned out to be comfortable (once we'd got used to the black!) with a very nice bathroom with a wonderful array of complimentary toiletries. We didn't have an evening meal at the hotel, but the buffet breakfast was superb, one of the best we've ever had.", "Date": "Oct 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR468752546", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Kikifrog"}, {"Content": "Great time in AC Som Just came back from a great week in barcelona and stayed in this hotel for 6 nights. As we travelled as two young couple, we were looking for something reasonably priced but good quality and AC SOM offered just that. Upon arrival we found the information we were offered at the reception very useful and they were always there to answer questions and more than willing to help us. Well in the beginning our airco didnt work but we were moved to a new room and didnt mind at all, our friends lights werent working and in the end we all got complimentary breakfast. For the one week we stayed the rooms were cleaned daily and the towels we changed. We were looking forward to going to the fitness room and sauna but unfortunately they were both so small we lost interest. The hotel is situated 3 - 5 minutes away from a shopping complex call Gran Via 2 which open until 11pm!! That was great and the mall is huge and there is everything in there. to get to the city centre (catalunya) wasnt a problem at all as there is a train to placa espanya (5 minute ride) and from there you can get the metro to the centre.It was hot but we always came back to cold refreshments for free!!

I was wrong.First off, the location isn't great. In the middle of what can only be described as a retail park. As you walk in you immediately get the sense of expensive modern style - which is partly nice, it is also incredibly cold, and not very welcoming.The biggest problem we had was with bugs. Only a few minutes after walking into our first room, we found a cockroach running around on the floor. We immediately called reception and they sent someone up to inspect, they then offered us another room which we accepted - plus a free breakfast the next morning (although its not like you'd feel like eating after having a cockroach in your room).Thankfully our next room didnt include a cockroach, although we noticed a fair few other small bugs crawling in and out of the woodwork (small white worm type things). We didnt consider this a big deal - although for the price you pay and the standard offered, you certainly dont expect this type of thing. The second room also wasnt quite as good as our first one - the bathroom wasnt as modern, and didnt include a bidet (something which is very common in spanish hotels).The room itself was well designed, with modern furnishings and decor, but quite cold (whites, greys, dark wood). Unfortunately we noticed peeling paint in the bathroom and some peeling wooden laminate elsewhere. We also had a cracked toilet seat. All of which arent big problems, but something you dont expect at this kind of hotel.The room service was touted as being '24 hours', with a menu in our room clearly stating this. Unfortunately when we attempted to order room service, it wasnt 24 hours at all - as the hotel was undergoing some changes they told us that it wouldn't be 24 hours until next month. Dissapointing.The rooms do include a complimentary mini bar; although this includes four soft drinks, two bottles of still water and one sparkling water - so no alcoholic beverages here. But it is a nice touch nevertheless. The hotel also offers complimentary Gym access, the gym(s) are small but well equipped for the average visitor. Plasma TV, radio, tredmill, cycle, a myriad of weights, fresh towels, water, a shower and a sauna. Very useful indeed.Overall we were very dissapointed with the standard, although the staff were helpful to a certain extent.", "Date": "Aug 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR940680226", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "DG55"}, {"Content": "Surprisingly Great This hotel was booked based solely on price and convenience to the airport.

The hotel exceeded my expectations. Having opportunity to travel for business I had comparison to 45* hotels but to be honest the Capital is nicer than many of them. The hotel is in the new modern building. The rooms are not big but nice and enough to rest after the hot day in Barcelona. Clean. Towels changed everyday. Reasonably quiet (off the traffic).Location is not a big problem (even if during our stay undergand station was closed and we had to use shutlle bus to Pl. Espana - 10-15 min.)The hotel has a restaurant but the manu is not long and not much sophisticated. Nevertheless, nice service! BTW, they have also nice concept Self Room Service. You call, you bring, you eat in the room (all at reasonable price).

PLEASE NOTE: The Metro is closed from July 16th to September 11th 2005 near this hotel. Just wanted to get that in the headline! This is a really great hotel, modern, light, friendly, spacious rooms, gorgeous design. It is obviously intended for business travellers rather than tourists (no pool or area to go out and get a tan!) but if you want a good base for your holiday, this is worth it. There is a massive shopping centre across the road from the hotel with a huge range of shops and restaurants and a large supermarket. The hotel is around 1 hour WALK into the city centre, so you cannot concievably say this is close - in fact the area, L\u9e93hospitaliet, is technically a separate city from Barcelona! To get into the city you would normally get the Metro, but unfortunately we found the Metro was closed from the day we arrived until mid-September which means you have to get buses into the city all the time, which although not TOO much of a hassle, is nowhere near as convenient as getting the Metro!

Listed as a 4-star hotel on some accommodation websites, the hotel is officially rated 3-star and located in the Hospitalet de Llobregat area, just outside the centre of Barcelona. The nearest metro station (Ildefons Cerd\u813f) is a mere 2-minute stroll away, however, so Barcelona's excellent public transport system means you're only minutes from the city centre. Just 2 stops along the pink L8 drops you at Pla\u83bda d\u9225\u6a62spanya, while a quick switch from there to the red L1 will drop you bang in the middle of things at Pla\u83bda Catalunya four stops later.The road onto which the hotel faces is quite busy, so street noise (as with most hotels in Barcelona) can be a problem. Several websites list the hotel as having soundproofed rooms, but this was not the case with our room so if you think that this may be a problem you may wish to check your room allocation before booking.The hotel itself is clean, modern, and tastefully decorated. Our room (812) was spotlessly clean and pleasantly spacious, and the blackout blinds and air conditioning were certainly a plus. Showering may pose a problem for less mobile guests, however: our bath was surrounded by quite deep stone tiling and the fixed glass shower door restricted the access space somewhat, which meant that you needed to be fairly agile to climb into it. Guests with mobility problems should request more accessible bathroom facilities.The hotel has a restaurant, but we did not eat there and so cannot comment on the quality of the food or service. We did notice, however, that the menu did not change from day to day.When booking, you may wish to reserve accommodation only, as we did. While the hotel serves breakfast, there is a large shopping centre (Gran Via 2) situated almost opposite the hotel where you can find a number of coffee shops and cheap and cheerful restaurants where you can purchase your coffee and croissant for a fraction of the price. The shopping centre, which stays open until 10pm, also has a large Carrefour supermarket and a large selection of shops in which to while away a few hours, while the restaurants and cineplex stay open until later still.", "Date": "Jan 9, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR928696400", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Friendly staff, clean room.
