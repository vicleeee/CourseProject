The staff is rude and not helpful at all. Our room was old and dirty. They advertise that rooms are air conditioned, however, the main air conditioner is not turned on until later in the year so our room was hot. We couldn't sleep with the windows open because traffic noise is so loud. When we asked the manager about getting a fan or turning on the AC he basically told us there was nothing to do about it. We woke up to construction workers outside our room around 6am and loud house keepers opening and closing doors. The walls are very thin, we could hear the TV from next door. At breakfast they serve canned fruit. Definitely NOT a 4 star hotel!!! I'd say it barely gets a 1 star!

It is in a fabulous location- a VERY short walk to the Termini and about 15 minutes to the Colosseum as well as there being lot of restaurants and shops in the immediate vicinity. The hotel personnel were wonderful, the breakfast was quite good and the free WiFi is always nice. The room was average and although the bathroom was large and spotless, there were a few \"dust bunnies\" under the furniture. Not a big deal as the room was basically pretty clean. They could have moved the extraneous chair out of the room as it was blocking access to the closet and had to be moved each time we wanted to use that side of the closet. Overall it was a comfortable stay except it was very hot in the room and the AC doesn't go on until May. As another reviewer said, if your room overlooks the four lane road which is jammed with trollies, buses and taxis going to the Termini, you're in for either an uncomfortably hot night or a very noisy one even on the 6th floor. I understand that the hotels are rated by various things like public areas, restaurants etc. which were quite nice but the room was not what i would consider a four star room.

We found it on Tripadvisor and it sounded pretty good. We were then slightly petrified when it went downhill in ratings with some comparing it to the Eastern European block type hotel. What a lot of nonsense!!! We need not have worried, as, having arrived, we were greeted by very polite and efficient concierge and reception staff. The check in was quick and we went to our room in a vintage style lift. We were given a fabulous room (standard double) with a double aspect windows and a nice sized balcony/terrace. The room was clean and a nice size, with lovely bathroom (great pressure and temperature control in the shower/bath). Tv in the room was the only 'ancient' element, as it was the old fashioned small screen massive thing taking half of the dressing table. But then again, we didn't go to Rome to watch tv, so... didn't matter that much. We did value unlimited wifi. You did have to ask for a ticket with the access code and each lasted 24hrs, but there was no limit as to how many slips you wanted at any one time, so we used 3 a day, as we had 3 devices. Breakfast was included and there was a lot more choice than we anticipated. Served from 7 until 10:30, it is very accommodating. Location is very good too: Termini (railway station) is literally 2-3min walk away; Colloseum, etc about 15-25 min walk; Vatican 30-45 min walk (or a short metro ride from Termini) and the shops and cafes are all around the place.

The location next to the Termini train station is unbeatable, it's a really convenient location. (When arriving at the airport in Rome, don't pay for a taxi if you stay at this hotel, walk over to the airport train terminal, pay 14euro for a ticket in the Leonardo train (use a machine, the shops at the terminal take a fee). Remember to activate your ticket in the yellow stamping-machine or face a fine!). When you get off the train, you have ca 400metres to walk to get out of the front entrance of the station, and then ca 2 mins to walk to the hotel)). The hotel is nice but it shows a bit its age. Things work and are fine, but not very fancy or super-modern&practical. Depending on which room you get, you may find the noise from the street a bit disturbing (I was on the fourth floor, window facing the street but was not bothered by the noise). The breakfast is served in the adjacent hotel (easy access through a corridor), it is included in the room price. It was a disappointment to me actually. These was so much stuff, and somehow it was all a bit mehh. No problem to find stuff to fill your stomach up, but not very inspired breakfast. Internet was fast and worked well in the room. The staff was friendly and helpful, and even lent me an electric outlet adaptor when I realised I'd forgotten to bring one. The area around the train station may be slightly dodgy if you're out a bit late, but there is usually a lot of people around, so nothing to be very scared about. The area has lots of places to eat and drink. It's easy to walk down Cavour to the Coloseum/Forum Romanum/Palantine hill and onwards to the old centre (eg. Pantheon) . If you need the convenience of being near the train station, and need things to work (internet, etc), then this is the place for you.

Everything else was fine, but given my husband's allergies we requested a room change. The front desk quickly accommodated our request and we were provided a new, smoke-free room.

I didn't make the hotel arrangements, so I was a bit hesitant about the hotel and area in general. The hotel was in a convenient location. Across the street from the Termini station and as everyone says, walking distance to all the major sights such as the Colosseum, Trevi Fountan, Spanish Steps, Via Veneto, Bocca della Verita, etc. Keep in mind that walking to them will take you 20-30 depending on your speed. We opted to get to places via the hop on hop off bus which stops one block away from the hotel. The hotel is on a busy street, so if you are a light sleeper, ask for a room facing the rear. The hotel itself has old world charm. Not what a typical American hotel offers, but the room was clean, wooden floors were a nice change to see, bathroom seemed newly renovated, and housekeeping was great. Beds were firmer than expected, but we were so tired from sightseeing that it didn't really matter. The elevator was small and a bit slow, but didn't add or take away from our stay. Monica at the front desk was very accommodating and helpful. In general, the customer service wasn't as friendly as I had hoped, but this isn't a 5 star hotel. Breakfast was a pleasant surprise - great selection of foods and beverages, including espresso drinks. The waitstaff in the breakfast buffet area were incredibly nice and always had a smile even at the crack of dawn. WiFi was a bit of a hassle as one needed a new log-in and password each day. Connection could be weak at times. I was a bit skeptical about the area at night, but since it was still somewhat light out at 9:30 pm, there were plenty of tourists out and about and restaurants open in the neighborhood. I wouldn't recommend walking around the bus depot or Metro station, but the streets around the hotel were perfectly fine. The area might feel different in the winter. Tips: to those coming off the Leonardo Express Train at the Termini, When you get off the train, do not walk down the stairs marked exit, stay on street level and keep walking past all of the train tracks and exit through the main doors. If you exit down the stairs, you will come out at the back of the Termini which doesn't face the hotel's location on Via Cavour.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "detroit", "Title": "\u201cThis ws an ok hotel\u201d", "Author": "flufferton", "ReviewID": "UR115360299", "Content": "We were traveling with a tour group, and this hotel was chosen for its position in relation to Rome Termini.

The only problem with the subway when we were there is that is closed down at 9pm due to construction, so it very much limited how far and late you could be out unless you wanted to get creative about getting back to the termini area. This is no fault of the hotel, but takes it's value down a bit for using it as a flexible hub. Walking to the Colluseum was 10-15 minutes and the Pantheon/Trivi fountain was about 20. Ok if you have the time but there really isn't a lot going on in that route so it gets a little old the 2nd or 3rd time. Also, we heard rumors about seedy people being next to the train station but I never thought twice about walking around the hotel at night, it was really no issue. The hotel itself was good. It felt like 3-star rooms, but all clean and no complaints. The rooftop bar provides a great view of the skyline so take advantage of that. Breakfast was really good.

My own experience of breakfast was disappointing because it was SO crowded, although I think I may have just been unlucky as several coach parties were taking an early sitting.

It was just me and my elderly mother. First of all, this hotel is in an excellent area for tourists arriving by train. It is only two blocks from the station. If you wish to ride the hop on, hop off buses, they leave from directly in front of the train station. So, transportation is not an issue if you stay here. The room we were given (two twin beds) was on the fourth floor facing the street. The room was much larger than I have seen in other European hotels, so I was a bit suprised. It was clean and everything was in order. The bathroom was very clean and featured a tub with shower and a bidet. However, the furnishings are a bit dated. They are in good shape. I guess this is all part of the ambience as this IS an old hotel. Reception was nice and helpful as was the bellhop. The elevator is small, but it is efficient and quite quaint. A nice breakfast is served in the hotel next door (the two hotels are connected). Bacon, scrambled eggs, a variety of pastries, cereal, etc. Not bad at all. Now, the bad things. Remember that I mentioned that we had a room facing the street? It is by far the noisiest hotel room I have EVER stayed in. (and I've stayed in a lot of hotels). It seemed that diesel buses passed by every 10 seconds ALL NIGHT LONG. Maybe this is a usual occurence in the city (I live in a rural area) so this may not bother some people. I just had trouble sleeping because of the noise. The other bad thing is: prepare yourselves for the beggars. They are all over this particular area. There were three beggars outside the hotel the morning that we checked out. One practically outside the hotel's front door, his wife (I guess) was directly across the street and two more (a young lady and a little boy) further up the block. I feel that the businesses and police in this area can do a lot more in keeping the beggars away. This seems to be a problem not only in Rome, but in Florence too. Probably all over Italy. I thought that this hotel was just fine (noise and beggar issues aside). I booked it online the day before we arrived and had no problems. If you don't mind city street noise and people begging for money and you need a hotel that is convienent, this is the one for you.", "Date": "September 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkshire", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Stay\u201d", "Author": "Ginja", "ReviewID": "UR5612666", "Content": "Stayed here for one night after a week in Tuscany. First big plus: 3 minute walk from Termini station. You can't not find this hotel. Booked room only 2 days before in internet cafe through Venere and was all set up for us upon arrival. Always a good start. From walking through the doors into the lobby, the hotel looks classy and for once the hotel pictures off the website actually look like the place you have walked into. Took the tiny (authentic!) lift up to the room and was very surprised at the size of the room. In that it was large! There was the main room with the bed, and 2 armchairs in front of the TV. There was a walk in closet. Long thin bathroom with a bath and great shower. And best of all, (once I worked out how to raise the shutters) there was a balcony area with chairs. View wasn't brilliant but if we had been staying a few days this would have been a perfect area for us to use. The furniture and decor in the room were modern, in good nick and fitted the hotel surroundings nicely.Very comfy bed and well though out lighting. Hotel is linked at the hip through an internal corridor to the Hotel Mediterraneo. This has the 10th floor roof top bar / restaurant. Had 2 very pricey and small cocktails up here but worth it for an amazing view. Just walking down Via Cavour towards the Coloseum takes you past lots of nice looking restaurants. Ate in one opposite the \"Gypsy Travel Shop\" which when the food eventually arrived was great. Breakfast was great. Turned up a bit near to the half ten finish time which meant we were hurried a bit, but the choice and quality of food was great. Bacon and eggs being my highlight. Left our bags with the front desk at checkout time (12:00) and picked them up at 17:00. Desk staff very corteous and felt safe leaving our bags there.
