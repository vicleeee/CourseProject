The hotel is well located right next the market \"La Boqueria\" where you can find many local fresh products and also delicious spanish snacks! The hotel is quite modern and staff were always very friendly. We had lunch and had dinner a few times in the restaurant and the food was always great. They have a daily menu where you can eat a full meal for only 16 or 19 euros, depending if it's lunch or dinner. Breakfast cost 25 euros per person. We tried the room service one night and we ordered the paella but we were a bit disappointed. The quality of the food in the restaurant is much superior. The room was big and very confortable. The bathroom was also big enough but they were some missing products like towels and bathrobes every days. Our room was facing the street and sometimes there was some noise in the morning probably with the arrival of goods to local restaurants, but nothing excessive. Bed was super confortable, like all the others Le Meridien hotels. Free wifi internet in the lobby for 30 min but you have a business center with 3 computers where you can use internet whenever you want to.

Starwood made no note on their web site or on the phone when booking the hotel. After reading about it I contacted Starwood and was given a pathetic excuse for not being forthcoming and never followed up as to the end date or confirming the completion.

My Blackberry was stolen in a tapas bar nearby and it took me one full hour to do the declaration of theft at the police station, where there was by chance a translator. Anyway, Le Meridien Hotel was really marvellous, from the hotel lobby to the restaurant and the rooms. One single negative point goes to the noise. The windows are not soundproof enough to withstand the sounds coming from the street. So try to choose a room located in another direction.

The hotel where that conference was held was quite nice, Hotel Miramar, with a splendid view on the sea and the city. The only problem was that the conference organization controlled the bar & the restaurant (that they closed to use the space for exhibitors) so after 6PM the only thing you could get for a 20\u20ac ticket (yup they sold tickets, no way to charge the room!) was an almost still frozen ham and cheese toast. As I was staying with my better half, we decided to move downtown to a Starwood hotel, Le Meridien on La Rambla. Dates of stays: From march 2 to 5, 2012 The Exterior: The building is nice looking, sober and classy, as usual with Le Meridien. It\u2019s located on a corner of La Rambla (upper part, close to the very very large Catalunya Square). The Area: Nothing is missing in the area: grocery stores, restaurants, bars, shopping mall (two huge el Corto Ingles), attractions, street life, and so on. Public transportation is fast and easy: buses and metros are all at Catalunya Square. Going up north, after the square, you find Paseig De Gracia that features more restaurants and bars, wine tasting bar, the luxury brands boutiques, and many amazing buildings, including 2 of the most famous Gaudi ones. I can\u2019t think of a better area to stay at in Barcelona. By the way, the Aero Bus (5,30\u20ac/person/one way) is going from the airport to Catalunya Square in less than 30 minutes and stops ! The Interior: Very nicely decorated, but small lobby compared to the huge one of Le Meridien Budapest. The lobby itself consist of two desks for the reception (with not less than 4 people working on a Saturday!) and separate desks for the concierge. There is also a \u201cbistrot/caf\u00e9\u201d. A bit further away, the elevators (separate ones 1-5 and above 5) and the hall to the main bar, restaurant 111 and breakfast room which is the 111 in fact. Check in: Once again, I called the hotel prior booking to confirm I could have a balcony because I\u2019m a smoker. Once again, when I called SPG to book and talked about my platinum status to get a balcony, I was answered \u201cwe will do our best but cannot guarantee it\u201d. We were welcomed by a very professional lady to whom I explained my desire to get a balcony. She was checking this with her manager and in the end I got a confirmation. The welcome package consisted in a free Illy coffee for two, free internet access for our two laptops, free breakfast for 2 every day, a Room Upgrade and free entrance for the museum of modern art. On top of that, we were offered a late 3PM check out as well. All went fast and with a true kindness to assist us, including taking care of our enormous luggage! The room: 546 (pls check the pictures) When going out of the elevator, guests are offered water bottles and apples on a table. Located on the SPG level, it was not a room but a junior suite. In the hallway, there is a sliding glass door to separate rest rooms. Then you are in the living room with a comfy sofa, a table, an armchair, a working desk and a chair. There is also a wall mounted very large flat screen TV and a sliding door giving access to the terrace. The terrace is huge and offers a very comfortable sofa, a table and two chairs as well as two sun beds prepared with sun bathing towels (see pictures pls). A double door separates the living room from the bedroom. In the bed room two twin beds, an armchair and another flat screen TV. There is a sliding door to the terrace too. The dressing room, separate from the bed room, features two closets, the minibar, the safe, bags for shoes and all you need for them. The Air Conditioning/Heating in the room: Perfectly working, except that, for some reason, the bathroom stayed quite fresh. The Bathroom: Huge and closed by a glass sliding door again. A second toilet, a wall mounted small flat screen tv, a large bath tub, a separate very large shower, a single sink and plenty of space to move around. Amenities are Cinq Monde, as usual, and everything is in double quantity: shampoo, shower gel, conditioner, body milk. On top of that there are cotton pads, cotton buds, a shaving kit, a sewing kit, a dental kit, a comb, \u2026 Comfy slippers and very comfy bathrobes are available too of course. The Bed: Good quality, but not as much as the other beds I slept in Le Meridien hotels I think. Besides that, it was twins and a bit small. The Breakfast: Held in 111, the restaurant, the place is very nice to have a breakfast. It was free for us, as since 1st of March, as a platinum member, you can choose from various welcome gifts or for a free breakfast for two people. The buffet has all you can which. There is a large choice of juices and coffees as well as eggs done on order. Fruits, cheese, breads and pastries, local specialties, bacon, sausages, mushrooms, Iberico ham and so on. You know what is a buffet, right? Nothing is missing. Room Service: Not used this time. Check out: Fast and easy. The lady on duty was from Netherland so we tried to speak a bit of dutch and French together, quite funny and friendly! The bill was correct and the checkout was a nice moment. Fitness center/Wellness: It was under renovation so we will have to check it next time. Having said that, they proposed vouchers for an external Spa for free. The Restaurants and bars: We were offered a coffee in the lobby caf\u00e9 and had a quite nice moment in the sofa. We did very much enjoy the restaurant, 111, where we had dinner on our first night. It was not only tasteful but also original and well presented. As for the service, TOP NOTCH. It\u2019s located on La Rambla, so in the evening time, it\u2019s great to eat well, in a quite atmosphere, and still have a look on the outside action from time to time. We went out straight on La Rambla for a after dinner promenade. Fantastic evening at le 111, we recommend it even if you don\u2019t stay at the hotel. Business center: It has it all, and it\u2019s simple to print a document using your USB stick. There are 3 computers, all logged in, no need to ask for assistance or password. I really liked: - Once again, the kindness of the staff and their efficiency in providing exactly what I hopped. - The way I was considered as a Platinum member is really amazing: Free internet, Junior suite upgrade, free water in the room, and so on. Especially that this time I used points, so except the restaurant bill, nothing cost a cent. - The friendly atmosphere of the hotel. It\u2019s maybe not the most impressive Le Meridien of the world, but we felt at home. I really disliked: I can think about something that was negative during our stay. My conclusion: After such a great experience, although there must be quite a lot of quality hotels in Barcelona, I think I found my home here for my next stays. There are always reasons to complain or criticize. Paint on the ceilings could be refreshed, or the lobby looks more like a 4 star, not a five star, minor details in fact. But hey, hotels have to deal with the location and organization. At the end of the day, what I look for is to feel at home, fell welcome, have a nice room, tolerance for my addiction to nicotine and on site facilities plus a good location. Once again, Le Meridien made my stay enjoyable. Thanks for reading one more bad English review!

Firstly, the positives... - Really friendly and helpful staff, especially those in the restaurant. - Food in the restaurant was great. Normally we mix it up and eat in and out - but we ate in all five nights - that's how good it was! - Food was quite reasonably priced with set menus for lunch and dinner at around EUR16-19. Three courses from the menu would otherwise be around EUR30-40 pp. Coffees in the bar were around EUR2-2.5. - Great location for touristing and within walking distance of public transport and tourist buses. Also great for shopping. - Our room and the hotel generally was clean and tidy. Now the cons... - The noise!!! OMG - our room was at the back of the hotel (i.e. NOT on La Rambla where you would expect noise) and the street noise just came right in with the windows closed. So much for double glazing?? There was a fire a few doors down on one night and the smell came right in too. We were on level 2 so maybe being higher up would have been better, but it made for five disturbed nights sleep. - Internet access - free in the lobby for 30 minutes at a time (you had to keep logging in) but restricted to 512k/s download speed. Very expensive in the room (EUR19 for 24 hours and faster but not that fast). Also, for some inexplicable reason, Apple devices are problematic and sometimes didn't connect. Surely this can be fixed? We had lots of trouble with three Apple devices and the front staff kindly cancelled our internet charges as a result on check-out. - The spa - well, there is no spa! It's curenetly a converted hotel room with a therapist who comes in for appointments. I understand it's under renovation, but the website really ought to say that. - Car parking cost EUR35/night.

Both evenings were spent with the people I was working with in restaurants outside the hotel, and for the most part during the day I was running / facilitating a training course. None the less, there are a couple of observations I need to make... The first is about focus on the customer... when I checked in I found I had an old 'Meridien' loyalty card in my briefcase - and always been one for collecting points I asked if it was still valid. Well, actually no it wasn't - not by a few years! So the helpful receptionist said she'd set up my details and provide me with a new card - no problem. Having checked in I went up to my room - and the receptionist rang a few minutes later to say that she'd 'found' me on the system and would be issuing me with a temporary card - turns out that I'd registerred a long time ago to SPG Group - of which the Meridien brand is a part. Very good service me thinks! I had only a few minutes in my room before going down to meet my Group for the first time, who were about to go out to dinner and wanted me to join them (this was around 7.30pm). As we were walking UP THE STREET just outside the hotel, the duty manager ran out after us and gave me my new card with my existing SPG Group loyalty card number on it. Not surprisingly, this set a rather good impression! The gripe I have is with the conference room we had - there was no natural light at all. I spent 1 1/2 days with the Group, which in a room like that would normally have been OK. However, the training session I facilitated was part of a larger conference - they'd been in there already for 2 1/2 days before I worked with them! My second postive comment though is about flexibilty and conference support. Whenever I wanted anything, I was provided it quickly and without question. This included extra flip chart paper, a snack in the conference room rather than a meal in the restaurant (for me when I set the room up for the course which begain 2.00pm on Day 1), photocopies, etc. Exactly the sort of professional service I want when facilitating a course. My accommodation was very clean and very comfortable. So overall, for business I'd say it's an interesting place for a conference. Facilities are fine, service is very good, and being right in the middle of Barcelona you have plenty of restaurants and other interesting places close by to go to of an evening. I'd certainly feel comfy if I was asked to work there again.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - perfect location!\u201d", "Author": "emilyll", "ReviewID": "UR122585674", "Content": "The staff was wonderful and really helpful.

The main entrance to the hotel is on a fairly silent, very fascinating side street. My recommendation is to try to get a room facing either this side street or the \"back yard\" of the hotel. Even on the second floor, the \"back yard\" view was fairly nice and the silence in terms of not being disturbed by the street noise was guaranteed. There are fairly many nice restaurants within a short walking distance from the hotel. What I particularly liked about this hotel is the fact that you get a fairly predictable Le Meridien service experience with a certain amount of local twist added to it. The staff of the hotel were extremely friendly and helpful, especially the front desk staff. Thank you for that. My room was fairly spacious and well-designed. It was a nice, well-balanced combination of modern European and slightly more Spanish design. There were enough power sockets in the room and they were located at the right places - something that you cannot always take for granted even at 5-star hotels. The bathroom was particularly spacious, very modern, and - even more importantly - extremely clean. For some reason, my back never really got used to the bed in my room. I am not sure whether this can truly be attributed to the bed or whether my back is simply used to an excessively good and highly tailored bed back at home. One thing that keeps amazing me at most of the hotels, including this hotel, is the fact that there is oftentimes only one door, instead of two, leading from the corridor to each room. I understand that two doors eat up some valuable space in rooms (especially when kept open), but one door is simply not enough to guarantee a sufficient amount of silence and sleep quality in the room. I found this situation fairly disturbing during my stay especially when my room was located fairly close to the elevators and the hotel seemed to be fairly full. As said earlier, the service at Le Meridien Barcelona was good, but not perfect. My apologies for the readers of this review, as I do not want to go into details here, but the staff made one fairly critical service blunder during my stay at the hotel - this was a one-time, isolated incident that could have caused some more serious problems. When they discovered it, they fixed the problem immediately, and sent me a nice bottle of wine as a token of apology. So, no harm done, and they clearly identified this as an area for improvement and provided a very credible explanation why this happened and why/how this will not happen again in the future. As is typical for most 5-star hotels in Europe, be prepared to pay (too much) for the wi-fi access and breakfast. Yes, the wi-fi access in the reception/lobby area is free of charge, but you end up paying approximately EUR 20 for the wi-fi access (for 24 hours) in the room which is ridiculous. Regarding the breakfast, yes - it is expensive, but it is also very substantial, caters to all tastes and preferences, and is made of very high-quality ingredients. So, I am willing to admit here that you will get a good value for the money. In spite of some hiccups listed above, Le Meridien Barcelona is a very good hotel and provides an excellent base for exploring the City of Barcelona. The facilities of the hotel are very well-maintained and truly provide a nicely designed, atmospheric environment for relaxing after a busy day in the city. The concierge is most willing to help you find and focus on the most interesting attractions in the city, and he was also very knowledgeable about the things to see and do in the city.

Very contemporary in design and well laid out with a perfect position in the middle of bustling La Ramblas. I had booked via Laterooms.com and I am an SPG member and requested a high floor and non-smoking room as previous reviews had suggested that the noise from the lower floors can be a bit over the top. Upon check-in I was shocked to discover they had me on the first floor. I asked if my requests could be honoured in some way and mentioned that we were on our honeymoon and then thats when things changed. A pity I had to mention this but relieved when they found a room on the third level and we had been upgraded to a Prestige suite overlooking Las Ramblas. A very spacious and modern room with a lovely bathroom and sepearte lounde room with circular couch. We were very impressed and also delighted to be higher up. However, being higher up at this hotel does not protect you from the noise. the partying in Barcelona doen't stop until about 6am so it was noisey all night, however we were in good spirits and it didn't really bother us. If I stayed here on business they may be a diffrent story. The hotel is centrally located and a short walk to the hop on hop off buses and all that Barcelona has to offer. the one thing which I just can't get my head around is the charge for internet access in room. This is the only 5 star hotel out of 10 that on this world trip wanted to charge for in room internet or WiFi - THIS IS CRAZY. At over 250 Euro per night I think this should be included. It is however available in the lobby but this is not always convenient. The overall servive in the hotel was good, the security in and out of the hotel fantastic and gave peace of mind to everyone.

My wife uses a wheelchair so I will review from that point of view to assist others in our situation. The hotel was completely wheelchair accessible from what we encountered. The lobby and restaurant had ramps where it was needed and there were no spots that we could not access. The only issue we encountered was that there was no ramp into the lobby through the front door, you had to use a small lift about 10 feet from the front door. However, there was always at least one employee outside such as security or bellman and they would operate the lift so we didn't have any issues with it. You can also enter the hotel through the hotel restaurant that borders La Ramblas because that it at street level. We booked an accessible room and a standard room, both facing La Ramblas. Both rooms had two full beds and the accessible room was well designed. The bathroom had a roll-in shower with a built-in bench. The only issue with the bathroom is that there was no shower curtain for the shower so you had to be careful not to spray the entire bathroom, which can be tricky. The room was large by European hotel standards and was easy to move the wheelchair in. One small concern regarding the bed height, the beds are lower than most hotels so that can make getting in and out of the bed difficult if you have limited mobility. The location is fantastic, it is in the center of La Ramblas and walking distance to many interesting sites. The downside is that it's very noisy so this is not a good location if you want peace and quiet. Service was very good and most of the staff spoke English, which was very helpful for us.

The location was unbeatable. I can see why some of the reviewers are mentioning noise, the hotel was right on Las Ramblas. Our room faced the side street and was on the 5th floor and we weren't bothered by noise at all (you could hear ambulances or police cars, but that's it). If concerned about noise I would request a room on the side street on a high floor. The room was small, but stylish, and the reviewers who are posting the outdated photos I think are lying. Everything looked new, and I can't imagine a hotel of this caliber having outdated rooms like I saw in one particular T.A. review on this site. The bathroom was great, although the toilet was really wedged in there. There was plenty of light, which I find is sometimes a problem in the Starwood hotels, and the bed was among the most comfortable we've ever slept in. The in-room internet is 19 euros a day and was slow and very unreliable. i would skip it and just trek down to the lobby for the free internet...which is also slow, but it's free. Also worth noting, is that the room service was actually reasonably priced. There was a small up charge but nothing like we usually see here in the states. Also, the room service food was pretty good! The hotel is literally steps from everywhere you want to go. Shopping, the metro (which was easy to use), even the Mediterranean sea was walkable. The concierge and desk staff were excellent, and remembered our names which was impressive. We didn't eat in the restaurant but did drink in the bar every day. The drinks are expensive, but very good, as was the service. I would recommend a trip to the grocery store which is 3 doors down to buy your liquor. the wine at the liquor store was about 2 euros A BOTTLE! It's hard to justify 6 euros a glass when you can walk 5 steps and get a whole bottle for 1/3 the price...but alas...it's a touristy hotel...so all is forgiven. I had two challenges with the hotel. The first was the check in. I had called in advance to request an early check in because were were taking the red eye. We arrived at 8am and were told our room wouldn't be ready until 3pm. UNderstandable because no guarantees were made, but still, we REALLY wanted to shower and sleep. They were very nice about it though and I understand the early check in thing can be a problem (however our friends who stayed at the W Hotel got right in to their room). The second thing that rubbed me the wrong way was when i ordered a Diet Coke in the hotel lobby. Now I expect to pay more at a hotel, but the can of diet coke was 5 EUROS, that's more then $7 for a can of Coke. I almost passed out. Later I saw a 2 liter of Coke a the grocery store mentioned above for .5 euros, so the overcharge was definitely not a European thing...it was a rip off thing. SUGGESTIONS: 1) join the starwood points club. it's free and they provide unlimited apples and bottled water on the starwood floors (or just go to a starwood floor and load up). Other hotels charge 2-3 euros a bottle for H20. 2) Ask for the AAA rate. it will save you lots of money and they never asked to see our card, although we did have it with us just in case. 3) Go to the grocery store just down the street (its on the same block) and load up on beer, wine, soda, and other 'rip-off' items. 4) Learn to use the metro, it will save you tons of money and was clean and safe (during day).", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Funchal Madeira", "Title": "\u201cVery good location\u201d", "Author": "Saint1", "ReviewID": "UR120523006", "Content": "We had booked in for 3 nights back in June 2011,and requested ,and paid for,a suite overlooking the Ramblas.

This is the 2nd time we have stayed in Barcelona. We wanted to be a bit closer to Rambla and to the port since we were staying there for one night pre and post cruise. Check in staff and porters were quick and friendly. We did not have a problem at all with noise in either of our rooms but we were not overlooking Rambla and would not have asked to be for that reason. Love the area but not the noise, so we were very pleased in that sense. The room was a bit tight of a squeeze with suitcases but we got the smallest room type. The bed is not a king, it is a queen. Sometimes it is hard to tell when you book a 'double' in Europe but it worked out ok. I, personally, don't like the bathroom all open with the shower right there on the toilet area but it was not enough to make a huge difference. When we did our post cruise our room had a tub. Love that there is a TV in the bathroom since I had finished my book and wanted a long bath. Nice that they had tea items in the room. We did have a bit of a problem with communication with the staff right after we left the hotel (literally max 10 mins after we left) as we had left something in the room and were already at the port and had JUST gotten out of the taxi to board the ship. The person who answered the phone said they would call housekeeping IMMEDIATELY and ask about our child's stuffed animal left in the bed. If they had contacted housekeeping immediately it surely would have been found. They were to check with the housekeeper and hold it till we returned 11 days later to stay overnight again and to call me back before we left the port. I would not believe that they had already done our room and left and disposed of our sheets completely that quickly, if anything the bed had been stripped but sheets still in the housekeeping cart or in a bag in the hallway where they leave them for a bit for cleaning pickup. I realize that the front desk was busy but they could have just said 'nope, we won't do that, or cannot do that' instead they did transfer me to someone they said could contact housekeeping immediately. I left my cell phone on until the ship left-no call back. That was about 2 hrs. My husband could NOT go back to the hotel to ask as you must be on board 2 hrs prior to departure and there was a line. At 3 of the ports I paid to go online and email the staff again asking why no return call and why no reply to emails. Still no replies by the time we got back to Barcelona. The ball was dropped by whomever I spoke to on the phone AND whomever answers emails. I know the email address was valid as prior to the trip I had emailed with questions and had a prompt reply. It is not like our child would die without the item, and we know it was our fault for leaving it but what if it had been something else? When we stayed on the return the people acted like they had no idea what we were talking about. I did not press it at the front desk as there were many people in line and it could be addressed later. I did not want to inconvenience other guests or upset the staff even though I was pretty miffed. I did continue to email after coming back and STILL with no response. I did email again about 6 months later when I got an email from this hotel about some promos going on and told them what happened. I did get a reply that they would upgrade us to a Ramblas View if we stay again. This was in September and our stay was in February. I have over a dozen emails that were sent and I had made 5 phone calls in that 2 hr time frame from the ship right after we left the hotel.

If you're looking for a quiet hideaway, this is definitely not the place for you - it is packed with tourists, tour groups, and flight crews. If you're staying for more than a night or two, book one of the Mediterranean Suites. The spacious patio is well worth the extra cost. Like many European hotels, I usually find the A/C a bit weak compared to US standards, so close the curtains when you leave to prevent the room getting too warm while you are away.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bend Oregon", "Title": "\u201cYou can do much better\u201d", "Author": "Donjo_ms", "ReviewID": "UR119436027", "Content": "I am current staying at the Le Meridien (Oct 17-19).

We found them very unaccommodating. It's always nice after exhausting travel when, although it IS before check-in time, the hotel accommodates you. Can't really fault them for not letting us check in early as it IS their policy, but it's still always nice when hotels go above and beyond and let you. No big deal. But... The biggest issue we had was with the staff at the front desk. It was very important that we were able to call home during our trip. I did my research and spoke to the hotel prior to our arrival. They had said that if we got a calling card in Spain that started with \"900\" {their toll-free number}, I would STILL be charged a one time connection fee per call from the hotel, but not per minute. Great, this is exactly what I wanted. I used the phone in the room a couple of times, but wasn't able to make a connection. Since it said the fee was per connection I went to the front desk and asked if I was still going to be charged for the call since I didn't make a connection {which I was}.....So this was my BIG issue with Le Meridien Barcelona.... I was just asking about being charged when no connection was made. All of a sudden, they said I'm being charged per minute, in addition to per connection. What?! I confirmed all this per connection/per minute business ahead of time, and now the people at the front desk are telling me to go outside and use a public phone. They said it would be less expensive. I told them that I didn't mind the one time connection fee per call. I don't care. I'd rather not use a public phone and I'd much rather pay the connection fee and use the phone in the comfort of my own room. Now they're telling me that when I call from the room, not only am I paying the connection fee, BUT ALSO per minute {which was an insane number}, even for a 900 number. I said that's not true because that's not what it says on the card IN THE ROOM. It also doesn't say that in writing that I got from the hotel before I checked in. I showed both to them. They continued to insist I was wrong. They were SO RUDE about it!!! They flat out told me all the other information the hotel had given me was wrong and they are the only right ones. I just couldn't believe this contradiction of information, especially since we went through so much trouble on confirming this ahead of time. We already used the in room phone a couple of times and didn't want to rack up the bill even more, so each night we headed out of the hotel, with towels in hand, to a gross public phone, in which we wiped down prior to using. I'll just fast forward to the end. It turned out that these rude people at the front desk were completely wrong, and it was indeed only the connection fee I was being charged, not per minute. It was frustrating because I wasn't even asking about that and they came out of nowhere with information I thought I already had. I find it even more frustrating when people working for the same company are on different pages with this kind of thing, especially in hotels, which makes it so much more stressful for guests. Aside from the rude staff at the front desk, the room was great. Nice size, and we really enjoyed the shower - the rain head was great.

All the ladies working at the reception spoke English well and were pleasant. However, it was a little bit annoying that instead of telling us that we cannot check in until 3PM (we arrived at around noon), they say it will be just a moment (the room is being cleaned), then we waited, and then when I check again they said maybe in another 1 hour, and then when we come back from lunch, they say it's another 1 hour wait, which ultimately takes it to 2:30pm. I read another review with the exact same experience, so maybe this is part of the training? If so, it's a bad policy. I would much preferred to walk around and have a leisure lunch. Asides from that annoyance, the services were good. Food: We did not eat in the hotel. It's about a 3 minutes walk to the Boqueria and there are a lot of nice restaurants within walking distance. If we had more time, we might have tried their onsite restaurant (it looks nice). Gym/Pool: There is a gym, but we did not use. There is no pool, which would have been great given the heat.

Walter Rijers is the Front Desk Manager, who I was corresponding with and met upon arrival. Noise was a not an issue. The hotel is in an awesome location, just 2 blocks from the heart of the city Placa de Catalunya. From the airport, take the blue Aerobus to the Placa de Cataluna (5.30 euro). At the Placa, you can get any where in the city via the metro and this is where the \"hop on/off buses\" are. Tip from the concierge, you can take the metro (1.45 euro) down the Ramblas and you get free ride on the Funicular Montjuic, to access the not to be missed Fundacio Joan Miro and Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. Nearby, I also enjoyed the CaixaForum, Poble Espanyol, Pavello Mies Van Der Rohe. I requested that the mini bar refrigerator be emptied, so I could store drinks and snacks. The large grocery store, Carrefour, is almost next door and has everything you would need. Don't miss the large open air food market, \"La Boqueria\" just down the street to see the colorful fruit, vegetables, fruit drinks, tapas, seafood, meat. Across the street, is Bar Lobo at Pintor Fortuny, has outdoor seating and the surrounding area towards the Museu d'Art Contemporani has lots of cool shops and places to eat. The Le Meridien Unlock Art program gives you free admission to this museum, it's closed on Tuesday. The room has a hot pot for boiling water and packs of instant coffee. Next door is a Starbucks and in the lobby, Latitude Bar 41/23 has coffee drinks and pastries in the morning. You'll get coupon for 2 free espresso or cappuccino. Free bottled water and apples at the elevators in the morning. The hotel provided a special treat, 2 bottles of water and bucket of ice on a tray, sent to my room. The hotel has in room Wifi for a fee (expensive) and Platinum members free, but it was a hassle for me to log on with my iPhone and Franco was helping me. This turned out to be the biggest issue that I had at the hotel. I think the Wifi is free in the lobby and there are 3 free computers in the lower level, which was a very nice amenity. The room was very nice and spacious with comfortable King bed (nice linens), 42\" flat panel TV with limited english channels, desk, lounge chair and small glass table. In room safe, robe, slippers, iron board and luggage shelf. Bathroom with tub/shower combo, rain head, TV. There was no Club Lounge or Club Floor. They did offer me a discount on the breakfast, normally 25 euros, for 17 euro per day ( you have to sign up for everyday to get the discount). You can also get room service Continental Breakfast for 16 euro. Overall, everyone was very friendly and helpful and you can't beat the hotel's location. It's too bad the hotel does not have Club Lounge which for Platinum members typically will get free breakfast, drinks and evening hor d'oeuvres. Most of the time, I will get upgraded to a suite and didn't here. For these reasons, I am not giving an Excellent Rating. Tip- at the Catedral de Barcelona, in the bookstore, I got a fabulous book \"Barcelona, the City, Map by Map\" by Barcelona Turisme for 9.9 euro. Also can get it outside the Catedral at Happy Books.

We redeemed starwood points for the 2 rooms, I am not certain that we would have booked here if we were paying the very high room rates. We were travelling with teenagers so booked 1 room with a King and 1 room with 2 singles. We were very pleased at check in when the agent told us that they had put us in 2 connecting rooms. We had not requested this so it was above and beyond for them to think of this and offer us this convenience. The rooms are really nice, appear to have been updated recently. Bedding is comfortable, bathrooms are stunning with TV. One room had a shower and the other a bathtub. The rooms are really small, but this seems common for Europe. We were not able to stay on the Starwood Preffered Guest floor but were told we could get water bottles, apples and magazines off of a cart on that floor. Unfortunately, the cart seemed to be empty most of the time and after a couple of phone calls about this to the front desk we had 2 water bottles delivered to our room. The only maintenance issue in the room was a slow draining shower, seemed to be plugged. As we did not discover this until the morning we were departing we did not phone about the problem, but did include this on our comment card. The location is as mentioned by other reviewers. It is just off Ramblas and a central drive from the airport and to the cruiseport. We walked up and down Ramblas and surrounding areas. This area is crazy, must be seen for sure, but I probably could not handle being around so many people for too many days. The hotel has a complimentary business center downstairs with 4 computers. However, the internet was not working during our stay, I attempted several times. This was mentioned to the front desk by myself and others, but apparently nothing could be done. This did not seem like a big priority for the hotel to fix, in my opinion. I liked this hotel and would stay here again if I was able to get a special room rate or use points again, but I could never justify paying the full price. I would also recommend the hotel to friends and family if budget permitted.

We had visited Barcelona before but enjoyed the hop on hop off buses which we used to get to Parc Guell for the first time and really enjoyed the architecture and ambience.

Our room was clean and had all the expected facilities including tea and coffee making facilities. The bathroom with 'rainforest shower' was a particularly positive feature! The breakfasts were very good with the usual range of foods and a few Catalan specialities too. We had dinner in the hotel one night which was very nice and the service good; a mistake in the order was compensated by a round of free drinks and a full apology! the public areas of the hotel were bustling and the staff polite and friendly without being intrusive. The roof terrace is worth hunting out and provides great views over the city. As a city centre hotel we were impressed by the Meridien and would certainly stay there again.

Location- This hotel is literally 2 minutes walking to Las Ramblas and about 5 minutes walk to the Catalunya (Barcelona) metro station. In about a 10 minute walk, you are at the bus that takes you to and from the Barcelona Airport (IATA: BCN) commonly known as El Prat Airport. Obviously, being caught in the middle of the action can make your stay noisier especially if you get a room overlooking Las Ramblas. Our room wasn't overlooking Las Ramblas but the less noisy street between Le Meridien and the hotel across the street called Hotel 1898...so noise from Las Ramblas was much less of an issue for me and my wife. My wife and I personally like being in the middle of the action because of access to the main sightseeing sites and public transportation. From this hotel, you are also about a 10 minute walk to the Barri Gotic district and maybe a 12 minute walk to the the La Ribera district. We can walk to the Picasso Museum in about 15-20 minutes from this hotel as well as the Cathedral of Santa Eulalia...so, again, you are very close to all of the major attractions. We considered staying at the W Barcelona and after having gone there, we are glad we chose the Le Meridien. The W Barcelona is a nice hotel, very modern, etc. but it is a ways from all of the action (about a 35-40 minute walk from the Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya (Catalonia Square) to the W Hotel. 2. Rooms were clean and spacious enough for the two of us. Flat screen TVs in the main room and the bathroom. Water pressure in the shower was excellent. I agree with some posters on this site that the showers can leak water because water splashes out because the opening to the shower is too wide open. Also, I agree, that the step out from the shower to the bathroom floor is odd in that the shower floor is higher than the bathroom floor (so be careful when stepping out). 3. Wifi access in the lobby always worked and was easy to get on. There is also a free business center on the -1 floor that had 4 workstations. There is also a printer that is free to use. If you run out of paper, as had happened to us while we were there, there is a service phone near one of the computer workstations and you simply call upstairs and the printer paper is refilled. 4. Concierge and room service- Both, in my opinion, were excellent! The concierge helped us to decide which excursions made the most sense for our week stay there (reminder- some excursions don't operate on certain days so plan accordingly). As far as the room service, the rooms were always cleaned with fresh towels when I got back from a long day sightseeing. Whenever I called for Room Service, they promptly came within 5 minutes. 5. Local market and Farmer's Market- You are within 2 minute walk to a market that contains just about anything you need to buy like soft drinks, baked goods, etc. The \"farmer's market\" called La Boqueria Market is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel where you can get fresh fruit, nuts, etc. 6. Restaurants galore within 2-10 minutes walking from the hotel. All different kinds of foods too! Cons 1. If you want it resort like quiet, then you probably should opt for the W Hotel or something NOT ON Las Ramblas. For those who are going to Barcelona for the first time, Las Ramblas (on any weekday and more so on the weekends) is like being on the busiest street in New York! There are just tons and tons of people, cars, and buses. 2. Workout Room- This is located on the \"-1\" floor and the gym is quite small as has been written by other posters. There are just two treadmills, one ellipitical machine, a couple of bike machines and then some weight machines and a small area to stretch, etc. The room also seemed to not have circulating air so it can get a little toasty in the room after running on the treadmill for 30+ minutes. Outside of the gym being small, it is clean and I believe it was open 24 hours/7 days a week. 3. No ice machines- To get a bucket of ice requires you to call room service. The two times I did this, the bucket of ice and two glasses came within 5 minutes of me making the call. 4. No pool. It would've been nice to have a pool. Hotel 1898 across the street had a pool on the top floor. The W Hotel also had a pool (although the pool was tiny).

Most of the front desk staff were \u201cTrainees\u201d. The rooms are extremely small. So small in fact that there is not enough room between the foot of the bed and the wall for a dresser! A small point, but there was no bidet in the bathroom, something we have come to expect in a European 5 Star hotel. The beds were extremely soft \u2013 so soft that in the morning we awoke with stiff backs. Another observation: There were numerous flight crews staying in our hotel. We know that they were not paying anywhere what we were paying. It is irritating to know that you are paying substantially more than other guests \u2013 even with an internet special. Finally, we have come to expect that there is a charge for internet service in our rooms. At the Le Meridian there is free WI-FI in the lobby. However, it is restricted to only 30 minutes per day. Neither my wife nor I would ever stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Rosa, CA", "Title": "\u201cCan Only Sing High Praises Here!!!\u201d", "Author": "MangoChetney", "ReviewID": "UR109313018", "Content": "First time in Barcelona -started a Oceania cruise here -- chose the Meridien for 2 nights pre-cruise.

Hence, I requested in advance in writing for a newer room. As a platinum preferred guest, Starwood hotels are typically very good about accomodating such requests. I repeated my request when I checked in as I understand that they cannot always block certain rooms prior to arrival. I was very nice about it, however the girl checking us in was snooty. Still it was disappointing to see that in a Starwood property as all the other hotels in our stay were excellent. She put us in a suite, however it was an old suite that had yet to be remodeled. It smelled musty, the carpet was dirty, and the bed was old and hard. Also, the couches were so worn, it was embarrassing that they were still using them. I called down and asked if we could please be moved to a remodeled room, we do not need a suite, just a newer bed would be nice, in a newer room that didn't smell. This is where I got a bit frustrated because the same woman who checked us in was a bit argumentative about my request to move, and kept telling me how she upgraded us. I told her we don't really care about an upgrade to a suite with its own deck, we would be happy to wait for a smaller newer room, iif that meant we could sleep in a more comfortable bed at night, and after what felt like some convincing, she founds us a room. We did finally get moved and it was an excellent upgraded, remodelled room, with a fairly comfortable bed. Despite the check in process, overall our stay was quite pleasant. The rooms are surprisingly quiet even overlooking Las Ramblas. The service people who came to our rooms were very very pleasant and Antonio in the coffee bar was a true gentleman. The bathroom is nice and modern and the shower is great. Our room was quite large with a separate living area which was excellent to relax in over a drink in the evenings before heading out to dinner. The location is super convenient.

This is the only reason which could let you think to pay 200euros per night (without breakfast, they offer immediately at the reception at the super special price of 15 euros per person, even before telling you your room number...), because this hotel is very \"artistic\", but not that much comfortable and useful. The lifts were 3 but one could bring you to floors -1, 0, 5, 6, 7 and 8, while other two let you go to the 1st, 2nd 3rd, 4th, and 0 as well. Why? The corridors are night, with a fine light and perfume. The rooms, instead, are small and lack of services. I had tea and coffee facilities with 10 sugar lumps, and 1 only tea bag and 1 only coffee sachet for two person!!! The closet was minimal with 6 or 7 cruthces, but had a trouser press. The armchair was useless because the headrest could not stay immobile and usually felt down. The tv screen was huge, but maybe too huge for the space of the room. Desk chair and beds were comfortable. The bathroom was very little, its door was made in GLASS (this was right in front of the entrance door) and could not close, and had a shower that was bigger than the whole bathroom (yes, it was nice and amazing, but I'd prefer a nice bathroom, with a decent door, or a small bath, than a \"super tropical\" shower). I asked the reception if any of the rooms had a \"normal\" bath and they offered me the little suites at 100euros per night of overprice. I asked the reception to book a restaurant for the night and they made it after nearly 1 hour, and I had to ask repeatedly before having an answer. I had even problems with ck-in because (I had to do it by mobile in the reception with their wi-fi) and when I asked them to make a free phone call in Spain to Spanair free number, they answered me that they couldn't do it and I could send an e-mail in the internet point at -1 floor (couldn't they tell me they had one at the ck-in, instead of giving me a silver tray with offers for breakfast, offers for museums, the keys and a bunch of receptionist's hair who became pale when saw that??!!!!)

It's also right in the gothic quarter, with many shops, restaurants, and tapas bars to choose from and close by to the famous Cathedral with the garden of geese. Nearby also, is La Boqueria - an impressive food market selling meats, cheese, spices, chocolates, breads, and everything else. Barcelona itself is a huge city and there really is so much to see. If you have a few days here, I'd recommend buying the 2-day ticket on the hop-on hop-off tour and alloting a day for each of the two tour routes. It really makes life easier and you don't have to worry about taking taxis. Highlights are the Casa Bottillo, Parc Guell, La Barceloneta, and Sagra Familia.

The double glazed windows don't do much about the noise on the starwood guest floors 4 and 5 on La Ramblas . If you are a light sleeper and are stuck with a low floor, request a room on the side street which is much quieter. This is the first time a request I have made was not honored by a Starwood property - Make sure you confirm your bed type and room location before going to your room because they might just put you anywhere really and you will have to return to the front desk - There was not much \"service\" at this hotel and our sense was that no one seems real happy about working at the the place. - You rarely get a hello by hotel staff so they really don't care if you are there anyway except for one front desk guy who was fairly nice and the bed turn down lady was sweet. - The concierge we dealt with was fair; he called a restaurant to see if it was open and available for us, and told us it was. We went there and it was closed...Yeah, weird..... - The walls between our room and the next was very thin allowing you to listen in on your neighbors conversations. Very entertaining but not good for sleeping if the stayed up late. The good: - Housekeeping we thought did a nice job on the room - The beds were pretty good; we are used to sleeping on plush pillowtops. While the beds aren't plush, we found them pretty comfortable and sleepable and the nice down duvet and pillows were very worthy of tired heads - The heating/ac system seemed extraordinarily quiet, bravo there. No sound of shutting on and off all night. - Awesome floor to ceiling black out shades in the room making it very dark even in the morning hours. The motion activated nite light in main room and bathroom were nice touches. - LOCATION: Much sightseeing is in walking distance as well as restaurants. Convenient to trains etc. For a fast coffee in the morning, starbucks is a left out the front door and a right on La Rambla and a few storefronts down. In maybe 4 minutes in the same direction, you have La Boqueria (market) where you can buy cut up fresh fruit (good place in first row as you enter) and great bakery (one of the last aisles on left side). We eschewed the hotel breakfast and picked up fruit and bakery and coffee every morning and took back the the room. It's nice seeing the market in the morning hours. - The Rainshower heads in the showers are phenomenal and the French amenities are very nice. You get an ample supply of hot water, very hot if you want it. The bathrooms are well appointed - Close to a basic bike rental place (take a left on La Ramba and Left on Tallers and walk down the street for awhile and its on your left through an archway) - Biking blows away the tourist bus if you are active and want to exercise - there are some good hills to bike up to. We had 3 gears and were happy. - Close to a great cheap fast lunch place called Organic (right out the front door and a few doors down). They even have fresh made juices; you pick what goes in. Save the time and bucks for nice dinners. - A pharmancy that sells a bunch of other stuff like bottled water is left on La Rambla and a few doors down - or pick up water at a stand in the median of La Rambla - Tons of shopping. If you go up to Placa de Catalunya, you will find dept stores etc. Bottom line, assuming quiet neighbors - or noisy ones that go to bed at a good hour, a room on quiet side or floor of hotel (if you are bothered by noise) and a good price, and you aren't expected a high level of service, Le Meridien would be a good choice. The rooms are comfortable and well equipped and the location is great.

I received great service from the concierge staff, especially Salvador. I enjoyed the saxophone player in the bar on Friday evening. I was assisted with getting taxis by the door staff.

However, I had a bunch of starwood points drop into my account a few weeks before our trip and decided \" Le Meridien\" was a much better location than the \"W\" for less points. Although our room wasn't quite ready at our arrival (post cruise for 2 nights) they secured our luggage and off we went to ride the hop on/off city tour bus. Returning to our hotel we determined after riding both routes of the city tour that our location was perfect! Checked right in to our room on the floor assigned for starwood preferred guest, I think it was 2nd or 3rd. The reason I mention this is that any concerns I had about street noise thru the windows disappeared, The room itself isn't huge but well layed out, with a great bath that is enclosed with a smoked glass door. Beautiful slate, storage counter area, tv, fluffy robes etc. We asked for ice and it was there within 5 minutes, had some issues with our tv and maintenance was there to fix it within 5 minutes. After we returned from dinner the tv would not work agian. A manager arrived immediately and when he couldn't get it to turn on he ran down to the front desk and returned with a key for another room. Since it was after midnight, we didn't feel like moving. No problem,he left the key with us to decide and comped us a couple of drinks from the mini bar. I had also locked myself out of the safe (my fault) and management agian arrived immediately. Seems like we were high maintenance right? In my opinion, no one tried harder than this staff to please. The concierge was very helpful in suggesting reservations and scored us a reservation with friends for dinner at Botafumeiro which was excellent. Side note - We bought the 2 day pass for the city tour hop on/off bus, the first day we sat up top and stayed on the bus to get an overview, this is a great way to see everything. Day 2 we returned to the must sees. Barcelona is a beautiful city and in spite of reading many reports of pickpocket or other thefts we never felt personally threatened. Will definetly return for an longer visit to Spain.

It is on \u201cLas Ramblas\u201d about equal distance between the Liceu and Catalunya Metro stops and just a short walk to the vibrant La Boqueria St. Josep (outdoor market). Also, close-by is the Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya & the Pla\u00e7a Reial (in the Barri Gotic). We arrived at the hotel about 9:00 am in the morning after a 12 day Mediterranean cruise. We were able to check in at the front desk without having to wait behind other travelers. Much to our delight, our room was ready and they let us have it immediately, instead of making us wait for check-in time. When we got to our room (612 \u2013 6th floor) we were delighted. My husband used Starwood points for the room and for an additional 1,500 points per night we got a 1 bedroom suite! The room had a very nice living room and separate bedroom, each with a TV. The bathroom was very large, all marble, with a large separate shower & bath. Unfortunately, there was only 1 sink in the bathroom & no drawers. There was also an electric coffee pot, safe & minibar refrigerator in the room. The minibar refrigerator had a very small space for guest use, just enough for 2 bottles of water. The room was quiet as it overlooked a side street but you could see Las Ramblas from the room. The lobby had a small coffee counter, lots of seating & free Wi-Fi. The concierge was helpful and was able to provide maps and other tourist information. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant. Aside from the great accommodations, the really big advantage to this hotel is its location. Being so close to Las Ramblas & metro stops is priceless. The metro makes everything so convenient, except Parc G\u00fcell. There are 2 metro stops near the Parc, but neither take you very close, so be prepared for a long, mostly uphill walk. I suggest that for Parc G\u00fcell, a taxi is probably the best way to get there. If you plan on visiting La Pedrera, Casa Batll\u00f3 & Casa Amatller, all are located on Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia and it is a nice flat walk from the hotel (about 1 mile). Barcelona is a city with a lot of restaurants. We ate at a small caf\u00e9 right on the middle of Las Ramblas pedestrian zone & would grab a quick breakfast at one of the little small restaurants lining the street. For dinner we mostly ate in Pla\u00e7a Reial, a nice plaza area lined with restaurants with outdoor seating areas. Great for people watching. We ate most of our dinners at Les Quinze Nits, mostly because it was the least expensive restaurant in the Pla\u00e7a. Sangria was about \u20ac8,50 per pitcher whereas other restaurants were charging about \u20ac18. I like my Sangria! We went early (5:00 pm) and did not have to wait in line, but when we left, there was usually a line of 15-20 people. The food was OK, not great, but we weren\u2019t looking for an expensive fine dining experience, we just wanted the experience and we were fooded out from the cruise by the time we got to Barcelona. If you are flying out from Barcelona and want to save a few Euros, take the AeroBus to the airport for only \u20ac5,05 per person. Catch it in Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya, just a 5 minute walk from the hotel. There are 2 lines, one goes to Terminal 1 & the other goes to Terminal 2. If you don\u2019t know which terminal you need, just tell the bus driver what airline you are flying on & he can tell you. (We flew international to USA on US Airways & that was Terminal 1). This express bus runs about every 10 minutes & makes 2 stops. The entire trip took about 30 minutes. Overall, we would DEFINITELY stay at this hotel again.

It's smack in the middle of La Rambla - while we didn't really do much on Rambla besides walk up and down once, it was quite centrally located for the other things that we did do. E.g. just across the road from hotel is the Gothic Quarter area, a much more quaint part of town. A 5 min walk down La Rambla and you hit the port. Passeig de Gracia (high end shopping) is a 5-10 min walk away. The trendy El Born district is also about a 10 min walk from the hotel. FOOD OPTIONS: Our room came with breakfast... which was a croissant, coffee and juice. Forget the elaborate buffet breakfasts that you get from 5-star hotels in Asia. The hotel's restaurant didn't look very enticing either. But that wasn't what we were looking for anyway. Within a 10min walking radius, there are plenty of excellent tapas bars. The market, La Boqueria, is also just a few minutes walk away (there are some good restaurants around the fringe of the market, cooking up fresh produce from the market). If not, the hotel's concierge was very helpful in recommending good restaurants. Just outside the hotel, there are a couple cafes/restaurants which are pretty decent. Don't go to the Bar Lobo across the street though - the guy in charge of seating guests lacks all sense of customer service and was very rude. ROOMS: Rooms are decent sized, beds are comfortable. There's a rainshower plus a handheld showerhead in the bathroom which was great!! If your room faces La Rambla, I think you get a balcony overlooking the street, but it'll be very noisy (probably into the wee hours of the morning). We asked for a non-Rambla facing room and it was very quiet. FACILITIES: There's an attached carpark. Didn't use anything else. There is a spa, but when I went up to the spa floor, it didn't look that great, nothing special. There's also a small rooftop deck that you can sit on deck chairs and overlook part of the city. It's very very small though. Nothing else up there besides a handful of deckchairs. SERVICE: Ah hahhh.... if everything goes smoothly on your trip, then you have nothing to worry about as the hotel's staff are friendly enough. But a hotel's service level is truly shown when things go wrong for a guest and they have to handle that. Several things went wrong on our trip: 1) Problem #1 with the room key cards - you can't put them near magnets or they'll be demagnetized. Ok, that's fine, who carries magnets in their pockets anyway. Oh, but these cards will also be demagnetized by a credit card! now, that I carry with me in my pockets. So essentially, these key cards are extremely sensitive so you have to be careful where you keep them. Small issue anyway, not holding this against the hotel. Just telling you so you know. 2) Problem #2 with the room key cards - we had two sets of reservations but for a consecutive stretch of days (in the same room). Now, at the end of the first reservation period (day 2), our key cards stopped working! We were very annoyed as this happened right after the first incident with our first set of key cards being demagnetized. The hotel apologized as they should have seen that we were staying in the same room (but but under a different reservation number) and not due to check out for another 3 days! This type of slip up should not be seen in a 5-star hotel. 3) Internet problems - our room came with internet but it wasn't working. The service guy couldn't fix it. The manager couldn't fix it. No one seemed to be able to troubleshoot the problem. And my husband NEEDED the internet to finish up some urgent work. The hotel manager's solution? \"I'm sorry sir, there's nothing we can do\" and the \"solution\" to the guest's inconvenience is to placate him with a bottle of wine or some vouchers, which we did not take as it doesn't solve the problem that I still need the internet! Common sense service would have been to offer the guest complimentary access to the business center. Or if there's no business center, allow the guest to use the internet access ID from a vacant room. Or if that's not possible, tell the guest where the nearest internet cafe is and offer to pay for an hour or two of internet access there!! THAT would have been good customer service! But NONE of these solutions were offered by the hotel. It was just, oh well I can't fix your room's internet connection, I'm sorry. 4) Concierge booked us for lunch at a really popular restaurant. When we went there, the restaurant was CLOSED!! When we asked the concierge later, he apologized as he did not actually call the restaurant ahead of time to confirm our booking (it looked like it was an online booking system). When he found out the restaurant was closed, it was too late and we were already gone. He did not bother calling us to inform us, though we gave our cell phone number to him. He did apologize later when we returned to the hotel and offer a complimentary bottle of wine. Seems to be the hotels answer to every problem. All in all, very questionable customer service skills when things go wrong. If nothing goes wrong, then you're ok. We've stayed in many 5 star hotels and the level of service we received at Le Meridien in Barcelona pales in comparison to some of the other top notch hotel chains. The staff are really quite nice and friendly, I'm not saying the service is horrible, but it's certainly not up to par and they don't go the extra mile that you'd expect from a 5-star hotel.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGood Stay and Friendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "Haleygrl", "ReviewID": "UR82226203", "Content": "The stay was very good.

If you stay on the La Rambla side it is a little noisy but you can easily sleep. The view is worth the noise if you like to people watch. The hotel is equipped with double pained glass in those rooms. There is a great restaurant within the hotel and a fun lounge. The gym is adequate with a small universal and some additional dumbells and aerobic equipment. There is also an adequate computer room with internet. You get free coffee in the morning in a nice little lounge. The concierge staff was very helpful and the staff overall is very professional, friendly and pleasant. The location is very convenient to many things including the seaport, with many attractions and a great mall with some good bars. Checkout is simple and taxis are readily available. If you would like to attend mass, which we did, there is a beautiful church around the corner. Best tapas we had was at Jose Luis (a short taxi ride but worth it).

Service was well-intentioned but iffy in quality. For example we asked for a pillow and got more towels (no pillow), asked for a small bed pillow and got one of their very large square pillows.

They had a nice reasonably priced cafe off the lobby, great for coffee in the morning.

Good first: The design of the lobby is fresh and welcoming in a modern way, a nice touch is that in the evening they turn the lights down and place out candles in the lobby. The staff is multilingual and welcoming. Check-in was swift and efficient. The room was large (we were upgraded) and the bathroom was spacious (decor was sparse but I don't mind that at all). If you are gluten intolerant they aware of what it is and they have bread for you for breakfast which is a definate positive!! The pillows are plentyfull and lovely and fluffy. Location is central in the city (if that is what you are looking for) yet, at least in our room, I heard no street noise. Not so good: If you are environmentally conscious or at all sensitive to temperature differences this is NOT the hotel for you. The Spanish government recommends to have airconditioning at around 24C to lessen the effect of aircon on the environment, here they have it at 21C!! This means it is cranked up to the maximum and when you come inside after having been in 35C outside it is a huge shock to the system (an unnesesary one I believe) just as it is when you come down for breakfast and you have to wear long sleeves in order not to freeze. It is nice to cool off after the extreme heat outside but this is taking it to a ridiculous level, even the staff is in long sleeves and I am not surprised. I mentioned it to reception and they said that 21C is what they are recommended to have it at... if for no other reason they should change it for the health of the guests and the environment... If you have a bad back and don't like rock hard matresses... this is NOT the place for you, I slept on the couch on our room... A minor peeve and yes a bit picky but the \"ambience music\" :) in the elevator is louder than a few nightclubs I have been to and I was informed that several guests have mentioned it and they are trying to get it changed.

Starting with Natalia Torres, the attitude at the hotel is very much to accomodate in every way possible. Natalia spent the time to review our intinerary, make several local suggestions and encouraged us to try everything local. She is certainly one of the best Starwood managers i have worked with. Location - it cant be beat. My room was on the corner overlooking La Rambla on one side and the side street on the other. Noise was not an issue. We were out from 8 or 9 am until 1 am every day, and if you are touring and experienceing Barcelona, this is the place to be. convenient to WALK or METRO everywhere. We spent three full days visiting every site imaginable and the base of Le Meridien was perfect. Regarding the amenities at the hotel, the rooms were great, clean, very good size for Europe, very comfortable bed and I was not on a Starwood preferred floor. As for the bar and restaurant, we spent the early evening one night in the bar watching the world cup - GO ESPANA! and had some Tapas. Otherwise. with La Boqueria one block away and many pastry shops as well, why would anyone ever want to have breakfast at the hotel. the concierges - i worked for several weeks via email with Borja to find restaurants that gave us the local feel and with amazing food. He was fantastic. Great follow up. we had dinner reservations every night and it would be hard to stack rank them as they were all good. The other concierges were good as well, booking our travel to and from the airport and also giving directions. Overall, i would highly recommend this hotel. Introduce your self to Natalia or any of the managers. As it always the case, you always receive the best service when you are friendly and open minded to the local culture.

There is no pool, but they do offer the use of one in a different location. We didn\u00b4t take advantage of this though. Seems to be quite newly renovated in a nice contemporary style. Internet doesn\u00b4t come for free (an understatement at 19 euro/day PER computer), but the wireless connection and speed is excellent. And if you can be bothered they do offer wifi for free down in the lobby. Location: The hotel is literally located right off La Rambla. In fact some of the rooms face that street directly. Our room was towards a quiet sidestreet. I\u00b4m sure La Rambla would provide great entertainment for the eyes, not so sure about the ears... It\u00b4s close enough to walk to some great high end shopping (5-10 min\u00b4s) in one direction, and a brisk walk (20 min\u00b4s) down to the harbour with all that it has to offer of entertainment, shopping and restaurants.. The metro and a pretty decent convenient store is located very nearby which came in handy. A few minutes down the street on the right hand side you\u00b4ll find a terrific market, a must do. Room: As per usual we visited 3 suites before settling down in suite nr 546. Now this is in fact a smoking room, but it doesn\u00b4t smell like anyone has ever smoked in here! A lot of the rooms seem to have a layout that is unique to them, so visits are recommended. That said, all 3 suites were great, so it\u00b4s just a matter of personal taste. I found the rooms to be very large by European standards, the same went for the beds. The bathroom was positively huge, with a fantastic rainshower. We also had a very large terrace which was lovely to relax on and enjoy the city views. There is a huge walk-in closet with ample space to hang both clothes and store suitcases. One thing about the rooms and their lighting though. They have these motion sensors that kick in at night and turn on lights in the bathroom/toilet. Now we were not fans of this, but if you feel the same don\u00b4t worry as maintenance can come and swith them off easily! The reading lights are also not great, wobbly LCD lights + the pillows could have had more substance to them. Staff: Smooth check-in and excellent Bellman services. They were very nice in order to accomodate our wish to visit other rooms. And very fast to bring the luggage around. Housekeeping were also very fast with bringing, and assembling the cot for our toddler (not sure what previous reviewers are complaining about as there is no cost for it). The cleaning of the room was spot on with excellent cleaning and turndown service. The room we finally chose had unfortunately 2 twinbeds, but they offered themselves to make them into 1 bed, very nice and surprisingly comfortable. In fact, the staff throughout the hotel are very friendly and good at what they do. They certainly have that extra touch that make you feel special and cared for. I would like to mention Bruno and Nina a little bit extra! Food: There is a nice buffet style breakfast. Not huge, but of good quality and selection. The times we had lunch there the food was good. And the service once again really friendly and efficent. Details that matter: They really do scent the lobby in the most wonderful way. Interesting art works throughout the hotels + such a neat little detail as that the elevators, instead of having music, has the most quirky little different sounds in them such as water draing from a tub. Fun art installation! We were asked by Bruno if the toddler liked chocolate upon leaving the hotel one night. I answered yes to which he replied that he would make sure that some was sent to the room. So upon our return we were greeted not only by some delish chocolates, but also a nice bottled of chilled Cava. Nice touch! Overall it\u00b4s a really friendly city/hotel to visit with a small child (2 year old). They also made the toddlers bed everyday, which most hotels don\u00b4t bother with. Things to think about: The Spanish hours are a little bit delayed to what most of us are used to. So please do take note that most restaurants don\u00b4t start serving lunch until 1300 or 1330. Dinner in a lot of places doesn\u00b4t happen until after 2000. And even the museums are a bit slow in the start with, for instance, the Modern museum not opening their doors until 1100 on a weekday. Just food for thought. ETA: We were supposed to have stayed from the 12th to the 19th, but due to the unforseen events caused by the Icelandic volcano we ended up staying here until the 22nd.

Being directly on La Rambla, we had direct access to the most visited street in Barcelona with all of its vendors, entertainers, outdoor restaurants and historical sites easily within walking distance. Every morning I would wake up and walk the 3 blocks to the Boqueria market to get fresh fruit, bread and juices for breakfast. There were some amazing Tapas bars with Cava (sparkling wine) close by. We walked through the thoroughly fascinating alleyways of the Gothic district to a Mass at the Cathedral. The hotel was only blocks away from Plaza Catalunya where you can catch tour buses, metro buses and the subway. The Hotel itself was very enjoyable. Again, while the room was somewhat smaller than you might find in newer hotels, it was plenty large for us and had a wonderful view of the neighborhood surrounding the hotel. We ate dinner at the hotel restaurant the first night and felt that it was entirely up to expectations.

We could have found a room for three at a less \"upscale\" hotel online for not much more than that and have saved the hotel points had we known that . After considering our options, I realized that there was an oddly shaped squarish chair in the room.

We were a bit concerned when reading up on the property because of some of the negative reviews. I am not certain that we all were staying at the same hotel. Upon our arrival we were greeted by the front desk staff with the warmest of greetings after such a long flight. We found Daniel (from Ireland) extremely helpful. The room was small but that is to be expected in Europe. It was nicely furnished and the bed was extremely comfortable. We had no trouble falling asleep. The bathroom was equally as nice. The tub/shower was a pretty high step into so I would be careful as it was even hard for me to get in and out of. There is a nice long hallway with a closet and luggage storage are so you do not have to step over suitcases. They are tucked out of the way. One of our main attractions when traveling are restaurants and we rely heavily on the concierge to recommend excellent restaurants. We hit the jackpot with Gill. He made us reservations at four great restaurants for the four nights we were in Barcelona. He was very attentive and knowledgeable. We ate at Pla, Con Majo (great paella), Bella Napoli (Italian and lively atmosphere) and Bembi (Indian). Thank you Gill!

It is just something that just happens between the 75th and 100th night in a hotel each year. I tend to stay with one group of brands more than any other \u2013 Starwood. Though I hold elite status with other lodging brands I find that SPG offers me the best perks and fewest headaches. They have a great guest information system, and when a hotel reads my profile and contacts my concierge with questions it is likely to be a good stay. Unfortunately this was not the case with the Le Meridien Barcelona. Upon reservation I requested two renovated rooms and noted that a renovated room should trump a non-renovated suite. At check-in, I was given one renovated room and one un-renovated suite. When I asked the manager for two renovated rooms I was told they were sold out and they could not honor a change in room type. I asked if they had standard rooms that had not been check in to and they said yes, but they would not switch. I had no choice but the take the suite, when I opened the door it looked like it was directly out of an episode of design on a dime. The walls were bright yellow, the wall hangings were worn decoupage prints of scrolls and faux leather, the furniture was mismatched, worn, cushions depleted, and the springs were shot. My mother threatened to sit on it and call the front desk to say she can\u2019t get out. When I complained to Delfi Ferrer the Manager on Duty (and the hotel controller) his only response was \u201cit is not broken.\u201d I am not really sure what the Spanish standard for broken is, but in my mind this sofa had missed its appointment with the dumpster for quite some time. The renovated room was not much better. The lights in the room did not turn on for the first few days, the TV turned itself on and off randomly (all hours of day and night), and the carpet was worn and dirty. It took no less than 10 visits and calls to the front desk to get someone up to look at the light problem, and I was at my wits end by the third day when an engineer came late in the evening and found that a dimmer switch had been disengaged. I asked him about the TV while he was there and he stated that it is a \u201csecurity feature\u201d - I was in disbelief, I was certain that something was lost in translation. I called Mr. Ferrer and was told that the engineer was indeed correct. They were making changes to the computer to see if they could stop the system checks of the TV\u2026 The carpet issue was never addressed \u2013 I opted for shoes. After the TV situation was resolved in my room (423), I got a call from mother in the suite (815) \u2013 \u201cI think someone is in my room.\u201d I ask her why, she answers \u201csomeone just turned on the TV in the living room,\u201d as we spoke her bedroom TV came on. The hotel was never able to correct the issue with the suite, nor was she ever able to get all three TVs to synch to one channel. Mr. Ferrer was gracious enough to send us to CentOnze for lunch. We looked at the menu and saw many tempting entrees, so we thought what the heck. We arrived at CentOnze and they gave us a great table by the window. We were given menus and told that we could only order from the \u20ac15 menu items - a selection of Pork or Rape fish and not the more extensive more tempting regular menu. We both selected the pork tenderloin. Though my mother\u2019s pork was fork tender, my was too tough to cut with a knife. I lost my appetite and sent it back. I guess I really should have had it sent to the homeless guy who was berating us from the other side of the window \u2013 but since security did nothing about him, I could only assume he would not get the meal either. I complained to Mr. Ferrer and he said that he had not heard any complaints. This is really just the highlights of the substandard service one can expect at the Le Meridien Barcelona. I know you may be thinking that \u201cthis guy is really persnickety\u201d but I hope you would also consider that there is a certain expectation when one is paying more than $350 a night to stay. There are numerous amenities that are commonly found in upper upscale hotels, but were lacking or inconsistent at this property. \u2022 SPG Platinum Guests will get turndown service for only their first night. \u2022 SPG Platinum Guests will get water only for their first night. \u2022 You have to call a special number and get approval to get your sheets changed \u2022 The concierge will only book reservations at the restaurants he recommends, if you did your own research \u2013 good luck. I had to go to the Manager on Duty to get him to book a table at Gresca for me. \u2022 Concierge line is VERY long, relax you will be waiting a while. \u2022 Hotel does not have a taxi stand, they hail they from the street and there can be a VERY long wait. We waited for nearly 45 minutes one night before cancelling our dinner reservations and going to a local restaurant. \u2022 Rest assured though, the apathy expressed by staff and management comes in an endless supply and it complimentary with every paid night. I spoke with Gonzalo Duarte, the hotel\u2019s General Manager upon checkout and found that the arrogance and apathy filters from the top down. He did not apologize, instead offered that he has many satisfied guests, it is \u201cunfortunate\u201d about my experience. When I got home, I called Starwood Corporate Services to file a complaint. The hotel GM had five days to respond, but he never did.

The 1898 also had a cool bar on their roof (Are you listening Meridien?) Room was small, especially for an \"upgraded\" one.

The lobby had free wifi, which I shared with scores of travelers in all stages of dress day and night. Would have been nice to have a pool at the hotel to cool off since it was hot there in Aug.

The onsite staff and terrific concierge (kudos to gold-key god Ricardo for clutch restaurant recommendations and touring hints) that really enhanced our visit. The location was ideal for us, right off La Rambla, walking distance to the Barri Gothic, and (for us) also walking distance to Barceloneta and the beach. We felt like we were in the perfect jumping-off point, and hoofed it everywhere. Shopping was literally at our doorstep. Best of all, we sighed happily each time we opened the door to our guest room and found that the air conditioning was set on stun, the room was always fresh and clean right after breakfast, the dual shower was spacious and invited many showers, a comfy and inviting bed, room-darkening blinds that really did it so we could sleep until noon, and the two TVs were a surprisingly nice (and necessary) diversion for news junkies on different English-language stations! The room wasn't huge, but was well laid out and well lighted so it didn't have a small-hotel room feel. We had our pick of nearby restaurants (right across the street, Bar Lobo became our local. It is the bomb for late-night tapas and serious cocktails made by Allesandro, and also weekend brunch). We could bop into and out of La Boqueria for fresh fruit, bread, and a host of other edibles on a daily basis, which was a lot of fun, and we enjoyed our late-night strolls for gelato from a number of shops that were open until midnight. The downstairs Cafe Illy was more reliable than the nearby Starbucks for morning Americanos, but we thought the restaurant onsite looked tragically hip and didn't partake. Sadly, some of the guests also were a little too foo-foo for our liking, but we rolled with it. Two relatively smal downsides to an otherwise great stay. 1) we kept forgetting to put our \"do not disturb\" tags out on the door and bedtime, so we received daily wake up calls, courtesy of the loud door buzzers pressed by the waiting cleaning staff. Shocking and startling are understatements. This would be a very bad thing for anyone with a heart condition. Also, 2) The sliding-glass doors that separate the bathrooms from the rest of the guest rooms are pretty loud when they close, and we were sure we could here them closing and opening in all parts of the hotel.

It also has a sport's bar (v useful to watch chelsea v barcelona)- altho prob not so good for those wanting quiet dinner in adjacent restaurant. rainforest showers are v good in the rooms. coffee making facils but stainless steel cups (yeuk). Staff in reception are friendly - but typical of a 4-5 star hotel... The downside: I just (reluctantly) paid 250- 300 euros/ a night! (rate varied- more for the w/end rate) for what I deem to be a 4 star hotel with zero atmosphere and zero style (unless you like really minimalist style). Few amenities, no outside space- Barce weather is great so roof top terrace/outside bar is needed. Nothing. A fairly depressing restaurant with mediocre choice (same re room service menu) and clinical coffee bar.. (altho there are plenty of places around, partic fast food and also tapas places nearby- and great fish restaurants in the marina- a taxi ride away tho). The room I had was a deluxe room- hilarious! I hate to think what the standard ones are like! Mine was very small, grim, grey and brown decor with 2 bright red seats (felt like it shld have been a van gogh painting...), with a very small window letting in little light, an (awful) view of peoples' washing and a derelict building/wall... The moment I walked in my heart sank and I wanted to walk out... I hated it. Very masculine, perhaps designed for businessmen arriving late and leaving early? The bathroom was also dark and very grey- altho the rainforest shower is a nice touch. The rooms were only made up late afternoon- not a major issue but other hotels would have this done first half of the day. I am afraid I would not recommend this to anyone! unless you can get a really cheap rate and cannot find anywhere else. I wld try the Arts if having to pay top bucks as for this kind of rate- you will get much better facils and a great location by the sea. I also spotted the majectic hotel near a gaudi building - which looked like it had a roof top terrace and pool.

After I complained about the room and pointed to my Platinum status they gave us a quite shabby unrenovated suite (also withou any view) on 6th floor. The most amazing point of the room was that there's a window from the hall to the bathrrom where you can directly look to the toilet. Whos idea was that??? Imagine the maid comes in... Another problem of the hotel is the internet connection. In the room it's \u20ac 20,00 plus tax (I really ask myself for what some hotels still charge money for internet access). In the business center it's free - but the computers are often occupied by children. WiFi exists at the lobby and at the business center, that's it - and it costs \u20ac 20,00. Thanks a lot!

We had booked a renovated Deluxe Room with a Rambla view, but on opening the door we quickly discovered that this is not what we got.

We also had a largish sitting area and a good sized desk. This more than made up for the disappointment of not being assigned a refurbished room, and so we did not complain to reception. We were disappointed with the selection of TV channels available in English, although in fairness we were not often in the room watching TV. We didn't eat in the restaurant since there was far to much on offer in Barcelona so cannot rate the food, although the restaurant did look very nice.

We were able to store juices in the minibar and made coffee/tea from the facilities provided in the room. This made for a stress free start to the day.

Room had minibar which was expensive, water 3.90 Euro there is a grocery store a block away where water is .50 Euro and wine and I believe beer was available all at fractions of minibar prices. One odd issue is that they do not guarantee nonsmoking suites, the one we had smelled fine, no residual odor but something to ask about if that is a concern.

Overall, the experience was good, but I have to say that the room design just did not \"work\" for us. We had one of the recently renovated rooms on the Starwood Preferred Guest floor. First of all, there is no privacy between the bathroom and the main sleeping area. They are seperated by a frosted glass door that did not close properly and was open at the top. My husband and I were staying with our six year old son so we had very little privacy for showering. The sink drained very poorly and the makeup mirror just hung from the wall sadly- as if the weight of the mirror was too much for the extending arm. There is a wonderful rainhead in the shower, but no means to prevent the water from spraying all over the bathroom floor. The lovely plasma TV was not working properly so we were unable to get movie or internet access. The staff offered to move us, but we felt it would have been too difficult at that point. You pay through the nose for computer internet access and a children's bed (50 Euro per night for the latter). It felt like the designers had some wonderful ideas that just were not practical. The wood floors that line the hallway are already showing extreme wear and tear. Lastly, there is a concierge desk in the foyer, but it is rarely manned which is odd for a hotel of this caliber. . Food prices are quite high and breakfast was not included in the room price. On the plus side, the blackout curtains provided great for great \"sleep ins\" and the housekeeping staff was top notch.

The temporary reception was very busy and crowded with suitcases etc of those checking out, or waiting for transport. Our room was initially not ready, but after a walk around the area, we were allocated our room. This had been fully refurbished in a modern, minimalist style, and the bathroom, although very smart, had a large shower area but no bathtub. The view from the room was of the back of some appartments and offices opposite. We did not have dinner in the hotel, but had a couple of drinks in the lounge, which offered good service, but high prices. Breakfast was included in our package, and was very varied and tasty, with some egg dishes cooked to order. Unfortunately on the last morning, the overnight thunderstorm had caused the flat roof above the breakfast buffet to leak, resulting in water dripping through the still live light fittings - not a very safe situation!

Loads of complementary toiletries and as we had taken one change of clothes (my significant other half had 1 hours notice of the trip) we used them. The Ramblas is a bit overpowering at night, loads of Brits and Germans looking for the Irish bars (who were the only ones to have security on) but probably no different than any other city at night.

We grabbed the TV so it was not damaged and went down to the front desk...who by now were flabbergasted.. 3) Disaster 3: We went to dinner at the hotel and the service was so bad they comped the meal.. we gave the price of the meal to the waiter since he and the staff were so embarrased at the hotel 4) Disaster 4: Not really a disaster, but by now we had been upgraded to our third room which had a massive jacuzzi and two bathrooms.

We took bus A1 from the airport directly to Plaza Catalunya and the hotel is a short walk down La Rambla. The hotel location can't be any better. The hotel is few minutes walk from La Boqueria, La Rambla is right outside your window, (if you are lucky enough to get one of those rooms) and 5-minute walk to the Gothic quarter. Also, if you follow La Rambla all the way to the end, you find yourself in an amazing marina. Since the hotel is under construction, there isn't any organization to storing luggage. There were luggage everywhere in the lobby and that seemed to be a permanent feature of the lobby. At our 2pm arrival, the only room with king size bed ready for check in faced the back alley. We took that room regardless. When we got to the room, she wasn't kidding that it faced the back alley. We were looking directly into other people's living rooms on the other side of the alley. The room is a decent size and the bathroom was great. Even though we didn't have a tub, the shower had one of those rainforest shower heads. The room came with all the niceties of robes, slippers, comfortable bed, clean linen, mood lighting and a 42-inch plasma TV. During our stay, housekeeping was very nice with daily turn-down service. If you have a \"don't disturb\" sign on, they always leave you a nice note to call when you are ready for turn-down service. The two computers with free internet access in the lobby is a great bonus. My main issue with the front desk/concierge service is that they insisted that we will get lost on our own and it\u2019s better to take one of their tours when we had transportation questions. For example, we wanted to take a day trip to Montserrat and asked the concierge for train station location. They insisted that we will get lost on our own and not enjoy the trip, and it\u2019s best to book a bus tour with them for 48 euro per person. On top of that, they would not provide any detail about the metro/train services we had asked. We ended up looking up the train service in our tour book and took a chance with \"getting lost\". It turned out that the train station had BIG signs directing you to multiple daily services to Montserrat. It was a beautiful train ride up the mountain and the monastery was fabulous. It cost us a whoppy 12 euro per person. (BTW, we saw the route the bus would've taken, and it could not have been a comfortable ride). Just on a side note, hotel staff constantly stood in front of the hotel entrance taking smoke breaks or just hanging out there. For a 5-star hotel, they could do better than that to their first-impression. Overall, the hotel is in a great location, comfortable room, and free internet.

Luckily, I had asked at the tourist info booth at the airport which gave me a map with the specific location of the hotel. I took the Airport Bus which cost 3.75 euro and takes you right to Placa Catalunya. Walking down La Rambla, it is extremely easy to miss since the sign is facing the opposite way of walking and you have to walk into the side street before you see more signs. There is still scaffolding and they were still in the middle of renovations. The lobby is completely renovated and there are 2 free internet terminals just up from the lobby. The elevators were quite tiny but there were separate elevators from floors 1 to 5 and 6 to 9. Upon entering my room, it was tiny. For a 5 star hotel, I would consider it unreasonable. The room was entirely renovated with a large plasma tv. The bathroom was very efficiently laid out but the sink is too small to be practical. Interestingly, there was a small LCD tv in the bathroom but I cannot see how this could be used since there is no bathtub but a roman bath. On a good note, there was a small personal space allowed in the \"automatic\" mini-fridge, something I've never seen before. The location on Rambla is great since you can take either the Catalunya or Liceu metro to anywhere else in the city. I recommend the Liceu metro station which was closer and less busy. My only communication with the front desk was a request for a late check-out the night before. I was curtly told to call back in the morning.

All three pieces of our checked-in luggage were lost. We were staying at the Meridien for two nights prior to a cruise and were quite frantic thinking we might not have clothing for the cruise, etc. When we checked in at approximately 4pm we were told that the hotel had been sold out and the remaining non smoking deluxe room was on the first floor overlooking the roof of the lobby and the dirty skylight on that roof. We asked for an upgrade (members of Starwood preferred) and were told there were none. We were offered a smoking room with two twin beds. When that was too smokey for us, we were promised to be moved the next day. Needless to say, that never happened. The front desk staff was cordial, but I found them to be unhelpful and ungenuine. They told us that they would assist us with checking on the lost luggage. They only did so when we were actually standing at the desk . Even then, one staff memeber decided that he had been put on hold for too long and just hung up. One time I called to inquire and was told that the hotel staff had called the airline at 11pm and there was no news. I reminded him that the airline luggage office closed at 7pm and so they could not have called at 11pm and he covered by saying, \"oh, well, I am sure my associates have been calling throughout the day.....\". Needless to say, the loss of luggage was quite frustrating. If the hotel had not offered to assist, we would have taken care of the telephone calling on our own. But the fact that they offered and then really did not follow through at all (and even lied to me) leads me to a pretty low opinion of the property.

We had a really enjoyable time and the hotel contributed to this - except for a few small quibbles. The hotels' location is both a strength and a weakness.

Our room on the second floor looked great at first glance - large bed ; huge plasma screen tv etc. However there wasn't much floor space left over. The bathroom again looked great - until you tried to use it. The design of the sink and taps is very poor - the tap is incredibly sensitive which combined with the shallow sink is an excellent recipe for getting an unexpected soaking. Then there's the bath tub/shower - the side of the tub is so high that it is extremely dificult to get into the shower. Also we weren't very impressed with the etched glass walls of the bathroom as anyone stood in the public corridor could easily see into the room if the door was opened for any reason.

Even Staff \"bumped\" into in the lift or corridor spoke without fail with a cheery Hola or Buenos Dais! The room (fourth floor) overlooked the street below, fair enough not much of a view, just the Hotel opposite, & not much to see each way, but we didn't go to Barcelona to sit in the room and look out of course. The room was great in other respects, huge plasma TV, further plasma TV in bathroom, turn down service, Tea & coffee / well stocked mini-bar, very comfortable bed, enough storage space, iron & board etc. heating & air-con which worked as the controls said. Brilliant shower! Sorry to say we never tried the restaurant, not even for breakfast as we were out so late at night, but others we spoke with found it fine. Breakfast in a Cafe on the Ramblas was fine for us, except for the beggars coming up to our table - the Waiters left them to it and we felt should have moved them on, some were quite intimidating. (Not the street performers - they are different to the Beggars and at least do something before holding their cap or bowl out). On another food note, we had Los Caracoles Restaurant in Calle Escudellers highly recommended to us prior to our visit, we like to think we are restaurant connoisseurs and frankly we found this restaurant extremely poor to say the least. We went on the Friday night to a pre-booked table that I took the trouble to ring and book over a week before hand from the UK, however we were crammed into a pokey corner and experienced poor service and very poor expensive food. We felt on leaving that it was a case of rush people through as quickly as possible to make way for the large queue waiting speculatively for a table in the bar. After all, most are City Breakers who probably wouldn't come this way again! We love the Ramblas and spent a good deal of time watching the world go by from a cafe table with either a beer or a coffee. It was about 20 yards from the Hotel door to being on the Ramblas if you like the area. Back to the Hotel, the piano bar late at night has a couple performing songs (up to 1am) and stays open until 2am, with as mentioned above great Staff to look after you. We like to sit at the bar and chat to other guests, being a 5* hotel stools weren't on offer and you sit at tables for 2 or 4, and the drink prices were very high, but what the heck, you expect that when you book this calibre of Hotel. In summary, excellent, and we would probably stay there again rather than risk trying somewhere else if we went to Barca again.

The room itself is nice enough (with a large bed, deep loveseat and chair, Mediterranean-themed carpet and wall colors, decent-size TV, etc...), but the views from the terrace can be marginal (unless you like looking down on alleyways, tin roofs, and into other people's apartments nearby), and the air conditioning doesn't seem to work. Oh, and the hotel doesn't have any fans. Fortunately, there is a supermarket a half-block up Las Ramblas (on the same side of the street), owned by the Carrefour consortium (which means it's much like most any other major supermarket chain you might encounter in Europe). On the first floor, they've got fresh vegetables, drinks, personal grooming products, electrical equipment (including fans), etc.... Make sure to check your bag in at the front desk before you enter the store, and keep in mind that if you're going to use a shopping cart that the only way downstairs (to all the packaged food, dairy products, fresh meats and cheeses, etc...) will be the elevator on the right, and is not well marked unless you're looking up at the signs above your heads. Otherwise, you'll want to stick with a hand-basket and the escalator or stairs. The bed in this room is amazingly hard -- the hardest bed I think I've ever tried to sleep on. I'm not sure, but I may have had a softer \"bed\" at times in the past when I was camping, with my sleeping bag on the ground. Or when I was crashing with friends, laying directly on a hard concrete floor with a thin layer of carpet. But my wife is absolutely in love with the pillows -- they give each of you a huge two foot by two foot \"back\" pillow, and a smaller pillow to use while sleeping, and they are high quality down/feather. But why have a nice bathroom with lots of marble and mirrors, if you're going to get a sewer stink? We passed a sewer on Las Ramblas, so we know for sure what that smell is, we just can't be 100% certain where it's coming from in the bathroom. And why have just one bar of soap in the bathroom? Don't you want a large one in or near the bath/shower, and a smaller one near the sinks? After you've washed yourself in the shower with the large bath bar, do you want to use that same bar again to wash your hands or face in or over the sink? Note that the shower is very powerful (enough to hurt, if you turn it on full strength), and can get very, very hot -- Think McDonald's coffee hot. I like hot showers, and I like long showers. I could only turn the handle very slightly past the halfway point before I felt like I was being scalded. And the hot water never ran out. The tub is also very deep, but is made out of plastic and was rather disconcerting to feel it moving underneath my feet. I later decided that it was intentional to have the floor of the tub have a slight \"give\" to it, to make it feel a bit softer and more comfortable. It also has raised spots spread throughout, which I presume is intended to have some sort of massage effect on your feet. The electrical power in the room is also marginal -- we lost all power earlier today, but we're not sure if it was a breaker that flipped or a result of the construction. We were leaving at the time, so it didn't really matter. But I would be very concerned if that kind of thing happened when we were going to be in the room for a while. Tonight, we've noticed that all the other lights in the room will flicker when you turn on another electrical device. Also note that most of the lights in the room are compact fluorescent, which tend to give off a kind of greenish glow, and don't put out a lot of light. If you have seasonal affective disorder, or get depressed at night if you have bad lighting, be warned. There are lights on the terrace, and they can feel pretty bright at night. The light switch by the door controls the power to the small halogen lamps in the ceiling near the door (over the desk), but also controls the power to the small halogen lamps in the alcoves and the floor-standing halogen lamp in the bedroom. Unfortunately, the floor-standing lamp is fairly weak (I'm guessing 100 watt or 150 watt, instead of the standard 300 watt). It took us a while to figure out how to turn on the floor-standing lamp, and even had the engineer come up to take a look at it to see what needed to be fixed. Avoid room 627 at all possible costs. It is long and thin (and weirdly shaped), with a tiny breakfast/living area at one end, and a tiny bedroom area at the other (just barely large enough to contain the bed). The air conditioning does work well, but it drips -- make sure you don't put anything underneath the vents on the ceiling in the hallway area. This room may have two TVs (one in the living area and one in the bedroom area), but the one in the bedroom area can't display any of the on-demand movies or other special content. You can get the small selection of satellite TV channels, and that's it. The one saving grace of room 627 is that it has a much larger and nicer terrace than any of the other Mediterranean suites, with views of three sides of the hotel. The other suites on the sixth floor look out mostly onto other nearby buildings. As far as the food is concerned, the room service menu is very minimal. The soups have been good, the single-serving size margarita (only cheese, no sauce or other toppings) pizza is hand-tossed thin-crust style (which my wife likes but I don't), the club sandwich is very good, the chicken with green tagliatelle pasta was okay. But whatever you do, do *NOT* eat dinner in the restaurant downstairs. It looks nice enough, the dinner is buffet-style (which my wife and I thought we would appreciate), but the food itself was marginal at best. It took me a long time to figure out when I last had cafeteria style food that was worse -- I had to go back to school lunches that I had in sixth grade, and even some of them were better. And the restaurant downstairs is Euro-style expensive, with dinner for one person running something like 30 Euros. The bar looks nice, and they're supposed to have live entertainment Tuesday through Saturdays. We haven't actually done anything there, but I think it would be hard to screw that up too badly. If your room is on the fifth floor or below, you have two elevators to choose from. If you're on the sixth floor or above, there is only one elevator, which is apparently also shared with the staff. You can get three people in one of these elevators, but that can be a tight fit.", "Date": "October 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid; Spain", "Title": "\u201cFantastic new rooms\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3976346", "Content": "Just visited on business this renowned hotel.

Added benefits are a huge plasma TV, a very confortable red armchair, a blue night light that guides you to the bathroom without disturbing your partner and a userfriendly lighting system.

We were dissaopinted on arrival to find that due to the renovations, our room was not ready for us. We were put up for the night in a hotel opposite (Hotel Montecarlo - absolutely impeccable may I add). The room we were given was a beautiful suite, and whilst this was a nice compensation and the staff did all they could, it didn't really make up for being unable to unpack and relax properly. We had to check out of the \"replacement\" hotel the next morning, but were told that our room in Le Meridien would not be redy until 2pm. This was understandable, but waiting for our room to be ready was not how we would have planned our first day in Barcelona. We pottered about in lovely Barcelona until 2.30pm, at which time our room was still not ready. We had been upgraded to a suite, and were told that as it was a larger room, it would take longer to clean. It was finally ready at 3.30pm. We were happy with the room (though it was not as good as the other hotel), but mostly as it meant that after 24 hours in the city, we finally had somewhere to shower, rest and avoid the sweltering midday sun. The ceiling had a large stain on it, and the room was a little average, if larger than we had expected. Whilst we could not have any complaints about their service, it does not make up for the fact that we effectively lost a whole day in Barcelona (out of three - a large proportion of our trip) waiting around for a room. I would advise you to hold off from staying at this hotel until the refurbishment is complete. You will have no problems otherwise, as the hotel is absolutely fine, but I would still say that it lacks personality. The location is great and the rooms are quiet despite being on La Rambla. My final remark is that on our last day (having not been woken up by the wake up call we ordered which never called!), we were presented with a bill for the other hotel we had stayed in. Of course this was resolved but 5* service it was not.
