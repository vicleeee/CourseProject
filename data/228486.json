Very welcoming and tell you everything you need to know. The area itself around the hotel is what you would expect for a city of that size. Center of Madrid is about 20 min on metro which was never packed. The room was lovely. All marble and very clean. I did notice a little kitchen behind a curtain which was secure so it couldn't be used. The food was great in the hotel but the room wasnt. Its like a conference hall but wasn't a problem. They offered free internet too which is super fast. I would stop here again as its cheaper than central Madrid hotels yet its not far outside on the metro.", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheltenham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat value hotel with great transport links\u201d", "Author": "NickiClaire", "ReviewID": "UR130809745", "Content": "The rooms are very large with a separate lounge and bedroom area. The bathrooms array also spacious with a large bath and hairdryer provided. The beds were comfy and the whole room is decked out in Marble and wood. Not really to our taste but pleasant enough. The hotel was very clean and fresh towels were provided daily. The reception staff all speak English and were happy to meet with our needs. We do recommend you request to be in a room not overlooking the road when making your booking as it can be noisy. We were initially in room 611which overlooked the busy road, train station and large nightclub. Although there is no noise directly from the club, it is a popular area for youths to hang out by their cars drinking, before heading to the club so there can be some noise heard from them on occasion. We could also hear the nearby train line and traffic lights beeping. We asked to be moved and luckily we were able to move to room 623. There was no noise at all in this room so we managed to have a peaceful stay for the remainder of our visit. It is a 2 minute walk from Charmartin metro station which offers great transport links to the rest of Madrid. It services lines 1 & 10 and runs until 1.30am. There is also a nearby night bus if you're out later which is bus L1 so there were no problems when wanting to fully experience what Madrid has to offer. There are also shops and restaurants nearby although we generally ate away from the hotel. The hotel is also great value for money as we managed to book a room for less than \u00a350 a night - cheaper than a lot of hostels and with far better amenities. Definitely recommend staying here.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel-Aviv", "Title": "\u201cOK, but not more than this...\u201d", "Author": "Sagi A", "ReviewID": "UR119179756", "Content": "I have stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in 10/2011.

Location - Nothing in the suraunding 2. No coffee maker facility in rooms. 3. Breakfast is served in a large hall but non fancy at all, looks like a dinning room in a school...

So, it was cold to sleep even though i used all the blankets available.. the bed wasn't very comfortable either. And the room was a bit too small for two people to move around at the same time. And I'm not very picky person normally. Glad I didnt have to pay myself for that hotel. It wasn't worth the price. I think.

It is located in the northern part of the city. A few steps from the Chamartin train station. This hotel is not close to the tourist places, but two metro stations are just 3 minutes away (walking). I recommend this hotel for long stays. There are good restaurants and cafeterias near by, convenient stores and a supermarket. The local bus station Castellana is also close by. Suites are huge, and confortable. The decor is old style. The staff is very friendly and helpful. If you are going to Madrid on vacations for a few nights and want to do lots of sightseeing this is not your best choice, go downtown.
