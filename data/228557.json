The downstairs areas are very pleasant and all over the hotel is typical 'antique' Spanish furniture such as mirrors and beautiful tables to soften the corporate feel. The management is professional and friendly. The reception staff DO speak English perfectly well. There are only two drawbacks: first, it is a 30-45 minutes bus ride into central Madrid (depending on the time of day, although buses are frequent) and a 10 minute walk to the nearest Metro station (Suanzes); second, you cannot rely on the airport shuttle. When I was leaving on a Sunday the shuttle bus left hourly, which was quite inadequate. Many conference participants waited over an hour on arrival at the airport.

And now about problems:house keeping-when we check in the room the safe was not working while the door was locked closed.If the safe door is not open the HK should check with maintanance before a guest receives the room.

Yes the hotel has that 70s / 80s feel and it has a curious almost museum like feel with lots of old grandfather clocks, paintings, cabinets, cases around the hotel. I would have liked to have known more of the history of each of these pieces - that would make them much more interesting. Despite initial impressions, my room was comfortable and well laid out with a really comfortable bed, good flat screen TV with three English Channels, BBC World, Fox News and CNN plus lots of local channels. Free internet access is a great feature and operates throughout hotel with good signal strength. I particularly liked the small led lights at the desk and on either side of the bed. Also the \"daylight\" lighting in the bedside tables gives a refreshing light when you wake up. Hotel has different levels with ramps added to steps in attempts to make hotel more disabled friendly. Parking garage on two levels below hotel but chargeable. I negotiated daily price down from 20 Euros to 15 Euros - but still expensive for a hotel out of city centre, Plus point is that there is 24 hour security in car park with CCTV and security in foyer of hotel who make their presence clear - a good security point. Hotel is close to a large el Corte Inglese store which is 1km away - go to roundabout / rotary north of hotel and cross motorway / freeway / autorout and follow main road. There are buses in that direction. No subway / metro close to hotel but did see a station not too far away. My room was a good size with a separat e desk area with good lighting and a table - two seats and a settee / couch in room too. No kettle or coffee machine however and no ironing board or iron which is surprising for a business / conference hotel. Laundry service was however quick and efficient with one day turnaround - but relatively expensive. Good efficient shower and nice bathroom. Air conditioning is efficient, but the fan cuts in and out when you are in the room and it is quite disturbing - I heard at least one guest and one of my colleagues complajing about the noise. Depsite what another reviewer says, my room had lots of power points at desk, beside table and in bathroom - placement well thought out and much better than many hotels where access to power sockets can be quite limited. I count eight in room as I write this review including one above bedside table ideal for charging phone overnight. It looks like some thought has gone into refurb / redesigh of rooms in hotel. There a small fridge / minibar in room too, with space to put your own drinks if necessary.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201c2 star hotel with 4 star prices\u201d", "Author": "LONDONUK1", "ReviewID": "UR21218590", "Content": "this is a basic safe neighbourhood 2 star hotel close to the business district and airport but with 4 star prices the downside the rooms were old and the sheets had holes in them.

Me and 3 others went for a 5 day trip to Madrid. The hotel is much closer to the airport than it is to the centre of Madrid, but the metro is a 15 minute walk and about another 15 minutes on the metro. So because of this, i guess it isn't the place place to stay for travellers. However, a taxi cost us only 12 euros, and was about a 10 minute drive to the centre, so didn't cost a great deal and we just used this as transport. There is a taxi stand right outside the hotel, which was very useful. The hotel staff helped us with finding things to do around the city, and were very polite. Room service was very quick, however we only ordered beverages. The breakfast was fantastic, everything from cornflakes to egg's to fruit and cakes and biscuits. The rooms were cleaned satisfactorily as well, and the rooms were fantastic as well as the bathroom. The only thing is that if you need to iron your clothes, then bring an iron as the hotel only provides a take away ironing service, and they cannot gurantee when your clothes will be ready!! The hotel also provides airport transport as well, which we weren't aware of. So we got a taxi from the hotel, which cost us around 20 euro's, however on the way back we were informed that hotel transfer to the airport was free, so we took this up!!
