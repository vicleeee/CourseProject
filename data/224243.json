First, what we liked: Location is great, very close to many restaurants in Coconut Grove. There's a Fresh Market right across the street. We were upgraded to a suite (but, I think many of the rooms are suite-like) and it was an enormous space. Living room, dining room, bedroom, with room to spare. We were on a high floor, with great view of ocean. Service was great. We had a light evening meal at the Bistro Cafe in the lobby and it was good - with awesome service. There were some less-than-optimal parts to our stay. Parking is $20 a day - pretty expensive for a Courtyard. I gave the room high marks for space. The room gets lower marks for other things. For instance, the bathroom was tiny! I mean it might have been the smallest hotel bathroom I've ever seen in my travels. Door to the bathroom had paint peeling. Door to bathroom also ended about 2 inches above floor - meaning, you could slide your hand under the door. Very strange. Our room had a connecting door to another room. One lock worked...the flip type lock had screw missing and was loose. One more issue with bath - we could hear the entire conversation in the room next to us (while in our room's little tiny bath). I was worried the sound would keep us up, but it didn't. Would we stay here again? We just don't know. It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't the best place we've ever stayed.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cA Really Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "OhioPassinthru", "ReviewID": "UR125142629", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here during late February on our way down to the Keys.

The rooms were nicely appointed and the balconies were very spacious. However, the rooms were not sound proof, and someone was having a party on the floor above which was really loud. You could also hear people talking in other rooms when you stood in the bathroom! The entrance of the hotel is up several steps and the hotel does not have automatic doors, which made coming and going with lots of bags a problem if the valet was not available to get the door. There was a wheelchair ramp off to the side. The parking was very expensive; soemthing like $26 for 24 hours. Street parking was available but required feeding meters. There is a fresh market accross the street and a refrigerator in the room which was helpful with feeding hungry youth sailors. The water was very hot, but easily adjusted, and the water pressure was fantastic. We had two rooms, and both of the rooms had lock problems. The locks are battery operated and had multiple failures while we were there, requiring long waits for the mechanic to fix the lock and provide new keys. My biggest complaint however was the quality of the mattresses. I have stayed at many courtyards, and I have never had such a terrible mattress. They had absolutely no support, and I had to continuously fight the feeling of rolling into the middle of the bed. My daughter and I shared a bed, and we both weigh about 120 lbs., so I do not think our weight was the problem! The microwave in the shop was not working, so you could not warm up microwavable food purchased in the shop after hours. We ate breakfast at the cafe one morning, and the food was good and the prices were reasonable. We would stay at this hotel again as it was very convenient for the regatta, but I do hope they upgrade the mattresses before then!

About 2 months in advance we reqested a crib and a bay view. When we arrived, we received only a partial bay view (room 808) and were informed that the staff couldn't find a crib for us. We made it clear that there are serious safety issues with our child not sleeping in a crib and suggested the staff to contact other hotels to find one. We had the crib by the evening but we felt as if we had to work to get it. Upon arrival, we requested a frigde and a microwave and got a fridge the next day and never saw a microwave. So much for special requests. If you want a full bay view, I suggest you request a pool and bay view. The hotel location is rather good. It's about 8-10 km from downtown Miami. A short 5-7min walk would take you to the Coconut Grove Village. It is located in good residential district. Across the street from the hotel you will find Fresh Market store, where you can purchase fresh produce, cheese and deli meats, wine, beer, baked goods and some ready made meals. There are also few restaurants (Monty's, Scotty's, Chart House) in 300m range that offer dining with bay views. Housekeeping in this hotel is excellent. I'd say the maid was going above and beyond to make sure our room was clean and pleasant to stay in. By far, the highlight of this hotel. Rooms are small but adequate. The bathroom felt even smaller. Rooms are not renovated and they have no flat TVs. The hotel's directory is not available and instead you are given a sheet with basic info (if you of course ask for it at the reception). As per the receptionist's statement, the hotel is yet to be renovated. The pool is nice and of decent size. The water could be warmer. The hotel provides towels. Hotel's wireless internet is slow but very reliable and quite easy to set up. Breakfast and snacks are available at the hotel for extra charge. Breakfast would cost you at least ten dollars per person. There's also a paid valet parking which you'd have to take if you're bringing a car because on-street parking is paid 24/7.

We had breakfast one day at the hotel. French toast and waffles. Nothing to brag about... average hotel room and a little pricey for what we got. The pool area looked very nice. We spend an hour their one night and had the whole area to ourselves. Parking is 20 dollars per day valet only... if you decide to rent a car which I would do. Taxis are expensive in Miami and nothing is very close to each other. Coconut grove is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel along a major road. Overall coconut walk area is dead except for at night. I was a little disappointed in the shop selection. A lot of empty stores waiting for rent. Overall I would not spend more than two days in this area. The hotel is looking a little worn and dated.

Parking is \"Valet Only\" so be prepared to fork over 20 bucks/day for it... plus a tip everytime you retrieve your car. 4)This hotel is NOISY - staff and maintenance make noise on guest halls at ALL hours of the night (like slamming doors and we never figured out where the construction noises came from). They also hold very loud parties and private banquet functions which create WAY more noise and traffic than this small old single-tower hotel was built to host!! 5)Maids are very nice, but only give ONE knock before quickly entering guest rooms so lock your deadbolt if you don't want to be walked-in on. **Some more positive things: Our room was a bit small, but it had a great view of Biscayne Bay and the marina.

The hotel was well located for trips out of Miami....it's only a few minutes up the coast road to the Vizcaya Mansion and gardens (very much worth visiting) and also the Fairchild Tropical Gardens, in the other direction (also well worth visiting) and the hotel is an hour from Homestead and the Everglades National Park. It was also well located for a trip to the Bayside Marketplace, about 20 minutes by car. Coconut Grove itself was pleasant enough but there wouldn't be enough to do for a week here, in the main vicinity itself, the main shopping area, CocoWalk was a 10 minute walk away and there were enough places to eat here for the week, the excellent Cafe TU TU Tango and the Cheesecake Factory. It's also a 20 minute drive to the airport and a further 10 minutes past the airport to the Dolphin Mall (if you can find it, not signposted from the road!!!) we did find it but more luck than anything! The hotel was welcoming as you get a warm cookie when you check in and the breakfast was good (we had the buffet, more for convenience than anything else, as it wasn't too cheap) However, when we got back from the NASCAR race late on the Saturday night, it was a shame that room service was not 24 hr as it would have been great to get something to eat, especially as we had to be up early for the Sunday race the next day. My husband had to chase someone up to get us a drink at the hotel pool bar as no-one seemed interested to serve us or the other people there who were waiting to be served.

She was impressed with the cleanliness of the rooms, their overall appearance, and the level of attentiveness with the service. Unfortunately, once the weekend came the level of service changed. This is a compilation of not only what I experienced while I was there, but what my guests experienced as well. For starters, the front desk was very obnoxius, particularly to my brother. The man at the front desk was checking him in, got distracted, and did not give my brother his key or room number. He looked up and asked my brother if he needed anything else, and then proceeded to get in an arguement with him about whether or not he had given him a key. Which was ridiculous, considering my brother was wearing his swim trunks and had nowhere to put a key! I had two friends arrive and head down to the bar for a drink. After requesting a couple of beers, the woman behind the bar informed them that she couldn't serve them because she was off duty. She went to find someone who could tend the bar and came back 20 minutes later. Honestly, how hard is it to sell a beer? A couple who attended our wedding requested a bayview room and did not get one, although they had paid the full price for a bayview. They were not refunded their money. My fiance's brothers wnated to get something out of the car, but since the car was in valet the valet had to go get it. They were not allowed to go to the car at any time to retrieve anything, So they ended up having to get the valet to go to the car multiple times. The valets were very inconvenienced about having to do ther jobs and go retrieve the items. There are two elevators. Neither of them work at any point in time. Pray you are within hiking distance of your room. Our final bill had valet charges of $20 a day for our car. The funny thing is, our car was back home in Atlanta. Please check your bill carefully if you stay here! I had many other complaints but these are the ones that stick out in my memory. Overall, my guests were very unsatisfied with the service.
