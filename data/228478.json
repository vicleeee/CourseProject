Easy walking distance from the Paseo de Gracia and close to Metro & the Gracia railway station. The rooms are OK, beds are average, large shower, hair dryer, air conditioning and a safe in the wardrobe and are fine for a short stay. The floors are laminated so you can hear people walking about at night but thankfully people were very quiet. The breakfasts are fine. You can have an express one which is coffee & some small croissants for 3 Euros or full breakfast for 8 Euros. The staff were lovely, very helpful with maps and advice about travelling and speak very good English. The main problem we had was the noise level. There was a lot of work going on with concrete mixers outside our window as they are re-modelling the Gracia railway station just next to the hotel and this continued late into the night. When that stopped there was still a lot of noise from traffic as the traffic lights are just outside the hotel and bike riders just seemed to be revving up constantly waiting for the lights to change. The road-works can't be helped but the double glazing isn't efficient enough for the noise level. We could have asked to be moved but we had hoped it would just be bad for that night. It wasn't. It's a nice enough hotel for a couple of nights, in a good location and good value for the price we paid. Just make sure you ask for a room away from the Via Augusta if you are not a heavy sleeper. The road-works are temporary but the late night traffic could be a more long term problem.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore, India", "Title": "\u201cBasic hotel at a great location\u201d", "Author": "Nitin M", "ReviewID": "UR127240895", "Content": "This is a basic bed and breakfast type of hotel. It is located on Via Augusta and has very good accessibility to the metro station. The Good: - Very friendly and helpful staff. They speak good english. - Great Location - Decently clean - Basic but nice breakfast. The Bad: - Very cramped room for the price. - Bathrooms are not well designed. When I took bath the water was all over the place. - No english channels in the TV - View from the window is pathetic. My window opened towards the back of the building and there was bad odour when i opened the window.

There's really nothing to do in the area, but it has a few shops nearby where you can pick up bottled water and bread for a breakfast to go. The hotel room was VERY clean with hardwood floors and even a flatscreen tv. The bathroom was also clean, but I had no shower door so water leaked out of the shower and slightly flooded the bathroom.

As most of reviews for hotels in Barcelona say, personal there is not well trained and they sound quite rude. I guess it is a cultural difference, as I am brazilian and living in London, I am really not used to people being cold when they are actually working for me. Here and in brazil people uses to smile a lot more and use words like please, thank you, sorry... in London they do it a lot. Anyway, the room was really small, smaller than expected, the window was locked and could not be opened. As Barcelona in summer time is a really hot place, we did not want to open that window and just let the air con on all time we were inside. The bathroom had a big window and it was not locked, which was great... for the first 4 days. Out of blue they locked the bathroom`s window one day (while cleaning i guess) and we had no key for it. I asked on the reception and they came up with this absolute nonsene about being against the local law to open those windows, because they were too big. It was an awful experience to use a bathroom with no windows... they should train that people to came up with better excuses, put smaller and open window or an air con inside bathroom as well. I don`t think this hotel is a good option as it is a bit far from everything and it is not a good value for money. I definitily not going back there.", "Date": "July 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Constanta", "Title": "\u201cAbout my Experience with Via Augusta\u201d", "Author": "Mihaiconstanta", "ReviewID": "UR15382541", "Content": "Everything was fine, no noise if you close the window, a little to poor breakfast but OK. Personnel not very friendly and did not involved in solving problems: for example, after 3 nights of staying at Via Augusta, my pyjamas dissapeared!!! I told to all receptionists about this but they did nothing about this for 3 more days! This left me a bad impression: they told me that I can buy a new pyjamas and the hotel will pay but it was almost midnight in the last night spent there: too late. Besides, I was only looking for hearing something like: \"WE ARE VERY SORRY FOR THIS, AND APPOLOGIZE\", not to buy me a new pyjamas!!! Sometimes, a nice word values equal to thousand pyjamas! That's why I said personnel not very friendly (or maybe not very well trained). And now I remember a holiday in Bulgaria (Hotel Krystal - Golden Sands): my boyfriend forgot a jacket on the tennis field and after 2 weeks when we go back there (we live in Constanta - Romania, at 150 km away and go there frequently) we found the jacket at the Reception. More than a jacket, we get a smile!", "Date": "April 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "Elisabeth123", "ReviewID": "UR15160260", "Content": "We stayed at the Via Augusta for a weekend at the end of March '08. At first we asked for a room opposite of the street, as we had read at this site below, that there could be noise from the street. But what a mistake! We got a room without a window. So we asked for a new room, which was much better. There is a metro stop nearby, which makes it very easy to reach the center. The breakfast included eggs, sausages, pastry, fruit, ect. everything! It was so great :) The staff was friendly and they even arranged for us to eat breakfast half an hour before it normally opened on our day of departure and a early flight. Near by we found a great local tapas bar, but don't remember the name of it.
