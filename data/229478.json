Location is fantastic, 5 mins walk to the train station and easy flat walking or quick tram ride pretty much anywhere in Amsterdam. The hotel itself is very well presented, feels very secure despite the proximity to the station, and is staffed by very professional, service-minded employees. I stayed in a club room and was also given a room with original wooden beams - very cozy and a nice touch in a chain hotel. The room was very large by urban European hotel standards, with plenty of room for a couch, desk, wardrobe, double bed, etc. Everything was spotless and in excellent condition. TV included two BBC channels and a few other English stations. Room was very quiet although the rumble of the trams going past was audible. Bathroom was a tad on the small size, but I attribute that to being under the eaves. My only quibble was that the shower water temperature fluctuated from cold to scalding hot no matter which setting I put it on, making showers a less than relaxing experience in the morning! The Club included free internet and printing as well as the usual comfortable lounge area with international magazines, two TVs, boardgames as well as snacks and drinks all day. The snacks at night were just that, rather than the hot dishes provided at other Clubs I have visited, but were perfectly fine for a drink and a nibble after a long day of sightseeing. Breakfast in the Club was more than enough to fill up for the day - breads, pastries, meats, cheese, yogurt, cereal, fruit, etc. Staff were very prompt in refilling the stations and cleaning up, even during the morning rush. I had one issue with a neighbor banging on his room door at 2am after being locked out, but this was dealt with swiftly and discreetly by the hotel staff and the next day I received a much-appreciated apology note from the manager on duty along with a dessert plate and bottle of wine. This is just one example, but I saw many instances of such attention to service throughout my time at the Crowne Plaza and was very impressed. Overall, this was a hotel I would definitely recommend to fellow travelers and I will stay here again next time I am in Amsterdam.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kentucky", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service in the heart of Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "travelmum415", "ReviewID": "UR127597272", "Content": "I stayed at the CP for business and also had a three-day meeting in their rooftop meeting space. I cannot thank the hotel staff enough for their hospitality, attention to detail and responsiveness. My hotel room was comfortable, quiet and extremely clean. I was upgraded and enjoyed an in-room espresso machine, a welcome sight to cure early morning jet lag. The lavender aromatherapy amenity items were also a welcome touch --- one of those little things that are fun to try when on the road. The rooftop meeting space was terrific ---- windows let in lots of light and views of the city skyline. We enjoyed excellent snacks during breaks, from fresh juice smoothies to small bites of Dutch pastries, all brought in by a friendly and accommodating hotel staff. The lunches we enjoyed during meeting breaks in the hotel restaurant were also very good. Dishes were light, fresh and served tapas style, which was ideal for ur group. Be sure to check out their Ideation Room ---- a great offering to complement their more traditional meeting space. If you stay here, I also recommend a juice/smoothie bar a few blocks away (go left as you leave the hotel, small green sign just past the cookie shop) for a carrot ginger juice and a homemade waffle.

How do I know? Because I am that American traveller that doesn't like to gamble on European boutique hotels. The Crowne Plaza City Centre is in a great location. Do NOT make the mistake my wife and I made of taking the bus from the airport (This is especially for those that purchase the Holland pass). PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE take the train to the Central Station. The tickets are quite reasonable and the ride is about 15mins. Once you arrive at the Central Station, you have a pleasant 10min walk to the hotel. If you're feeling tired- you can always hop on the tram. The hotel is modern; the staff is quite hospitable; and last but not least- the hotel is clean! Cleanliness means a great deal to my wife and I. We were both very pleased. Note to fellow American travellers: unlike many European hotels, the Crowne Plaza City Centre has face towels. Face towels (aka as wash cloths) and European hotels don't always go hand and hand. When we visited Prague, they offered hand towels rather than face towels. It's the little things, you know? As for ammenities, the fitness room they have is quite adequate. If memory serves me correctly, there are five cardio machines; a dumbbell rack; a bench; one palates ball; and a three station machine weight centre. The fitness room is of descent size- I didn't feel smothered at all (and I worked out twice in a 3-day stay). The room also has a water cooler w/ cups; and a mens and women's changing room (w/ additional towels available). The fitness room also has a good size flat screen mounted on the wall. The office centre has 3 desktops and a printer for those that need to print directions, passes or plane tickets. Your lodging fee also includes one bottle of Spa sparkling water that housekeeping replaces after each visit. Note: My wife and I don't believe anything is complimentary- YOU PAID FOR IT! The rooms also have easy to use safes. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any worries about locking up our passports; jewellery; gadgets; etc. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the onsite restaurant, or make use of the snack refrigerator in our room. Ice machines are not on every floor. We stayed on the 5th floor, and I had to go to the 6th floor for ice. That was not a big deal at all. Last but not least, the hotel is surrounded by plenty of shops; eateries; cafes, and coffee shops. If you're not one for walking, the closest tram stop is no more than a 3min walk from the hotel. The only gripe I have is the fee associated w/ wifi. There is no reason anyone should have to pay for Internet or wifi. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow this one hiccup to jade my overall experience. My wife and I have already made this our hotel of choice if we're ever in Amsterdam.

Just come back from a weekend that i had booked as a reward night.I was checked in as normal by the most friendliest hotel staff i have ever come across,I was explained that as a Platinum member they had upgraded me from a superior Twin bedded room to an executive room with the following benefits: 2 free drinks complimentary wifi (you have to charge to room,but automatically comes off after midnight) 50% discount off breakfast (never managed to get up for breakfast haha,but sure it would of been first class) 25% discount on calls 25% discount on valet parking At first i was a little disappointed that my room only had 2 single beds,where as i was used to he twin bedded rooms previously as the beds were huge,but to be honest they were perfect anyway and the most comfiest mattress we have both slept on (where do you get them as i want one for my house) The room also had a huge work station and a coffee machine As we never made it up till past 1400pm one day we had a letter posted to room saying our room would not be made up,but to contact them if we require anything,so i asked for the bathroom to be cleaned and towels replaced and was done straight away(amazing service) I managed to knock over a vodka in the mini bar so had that on my bill,but a simple visit to front desk got that swiftly adjusted(again perfect service) We were on the 4th floor and there was not a whisper anywhere in the hotel,so nice not to have loads of banging doors (only banging headaches haha) We had room service on Sat and had the cheese and ham toastie with chips,the service was amazing and the food great quality at only 6.50 euro each plus a overall 2.50 surcharge (great value that so please keep up the good work) The only thing i don't like about the room is the location of plug sockets 1 under the desk (had to crawl around floor) 2 beside coffee machine,but hard to get in about for the coffee machine and 1 on floor for a light,but the phone charger would not fit as too close to floor,so overall the locations of plugs not great as they are not near where you would like them (for me that would be beside bedside cabinet) Loved the new entry system for the rooms,very easy to use just hold you card against it and it opens Next time i stay i would love to try out the club lounge,but cant work out what room i would need to qualify for this? Can`t wait till i visit again,still the best hotel in Europe with the best customer care levels throughout the hotel i have stayed in (Front desk staff,bar staff,late duty staff,housekeeping all deserve praise)", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Preston UK", "Title": "\u201cGo on...treat yourself\u201d", "Author": "vermeer", "ReviewID": "UR126261215", "Content": "All right the Crowne Plaza is part of a huge chain of hotels, but staying here you would not know it.

The hotel is conveniently located about 5 minutes walk from the Central Station. If you are travelling from the Airport (Schiphol), this will be an easy 25-30 minutes train ride without having to stop and change to a different train line. Once you are in the central station, there is a machine (right next to the ATM by the entrance/ exit door) where you can get a printable local map. The Crowne Plaza is listed as one of the hotels nearby the station; and you can get a printable map on how to get the hotel from that machine. There are plenty of restaurants and souvenir shops within walking distance. The closest tram stop is literally right in front of the hotel (one minute walk, and yes I timed it!). The front desk staffs were very friendly and helpful. The concierge also sells the 24/48/72/96 hours tram cards along with the Rijksmuseum tickets. It was super convenient because they can just charge them to your room; and for the museum ticket, this means that you can skip the ticket queue. I think they also sell both Van Gogh and Anne Frank museum tickets (for the same prices if you were to you buy them at the museums). When I was there, they did not have the tickets in stock for these two locations. One thing to mention is that this hotel is located in a very touristy and commercialized area. The plus is rather obvious: central location and close to all major public transportations. The downside is that for folks who are more into local and non-touristy places, this hotel is probably not for you.

We arrived at about 11am and our room was ready already, despite check-in time not being til' afternoon. The receptionist welcomed us, thanked me for my loyalty to the Priority Club programme and offered us detailed information on Amsterdam itself. Our room was located on the 4th floor, room 416, which is easily accessible by lift. The room itself was spacious and immaculate, with a large comfy bed and all the facilities you'd wish for. The bathroom has a powerful shower/bath and although not the largest I've seen, it fits the bill perfectly. All the staff at the hotel are exceptional, and always greet you before you have the chance to greet them. It's the little touches they add, such as the great customer service, pillow sprays to help you sleep and biscuits with the tea/coffee facilities that make this hotel stand out from the competition!

There was also breakfast provided in the morning, there is room for improvement with the selection of food in the morning. The location of the hotel was brilliant.

Even though it was very central, you couldn't hear any noise or anything while you were in your room. The only problem we did have was that I called the general enquiries number a few days before we left to ask whether I would have to pay a deposit or anything of that sort on arrival and was told no, everything has been paid for. But on arrival at the hotel I had to give my bank card in for them to hold a \u00c2\u00a350 deposit. I can totally understand why a deposit is required (in case you drink/eat from the mini bar in the room), but a little tip would be to forewarn guests so they are prepared.

Executive floor and lounge available. The staff is very professional and friendly, the room service is quick responding. The breakfast is good, in any case they have to improve the selection of jams (only strawberry and orange taste available) such as the selection of cheese (we are in Holland!!!!) and ham. It is possible to have fried eggs, omelettes and crepes expressly made by a chef present in the breakfast room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6which is the same location of the New Dorrius restaurant.

For that reason I find the internet policy quite stupid, as you find around the hotel some pubs which provide FREE INTERNET CONNECTION to all their customers.

The room's air conditioning. We would not feel able to return to this hotel nor to any other Crowne Plaza with a similar setup. To us it is absolurely vital to be able to have a good night's sleep. To this end we like to have quiteness and an acceptable room temperature. This was impossible. The room's air conditioning could not be switched off and all the windows were without openings. It might not seem important to most people but the lowest fan level still made a considerable noise. I rang about this the first night after trying for an hour to fall asleep. I was told that the air conditioning was so installed that there was always some air entering the room. I was told that every room was the same. I have only once before been in a hotel which had no way of opening windows or of switching off the air conditioning, so I never thought to ask beforehand. Even on the 15th floor of the Park Lane Hilton it is possible to get some fresh air! So, thank you, Crowne Plaza, for doing so much to create a lovely hotel.

It is literally a 3 minute walk from Amsterdam Centraal Station, which means you can take the train from Schiphol to City Centre and arrive at the hotel in about 20 minutes depending on the wait for your train. It is also very close to the main sections of Amsterdam all in walking distance to some great restaurants, Anne Frank House, shopping, etc. 2) hospitality. The staff are extremely friendly, courteous, and goes above and beyond to make you feel comfortable. 10 minutes after we entered our room, the front desk called to ask if we were satisfied with our room. Of course we were, but I believe they would have changed it for us if we were not. 3) modern. Great modern interior design and decor makes you feel like you are in a posh atmosphere. 4) breakfast. The breakfast buffet was exceptional. The staff are extremely friendly, service is great, and their selection is rich and various with high quality fresh ingredients. We were not disappointed. I liked the egg/omelette station which the chef cooked for you to your specifications. Good coffee too. One\u00c2\u00a0 important note: during my last visit here, our one complaint was that they failed to give us a wake-up call. You can read my review below. I want to say here that the manager contacted me and apologized for this and to make up for it, offered me a complimentary one night stay, which we used for this stopover. Thank you to Mr. Maurice Janssen for your kindness and hospitality. Again this is to show that this hotel will go above and beyond your needs to make sure that you will return to this hotel, which we gladly will.

The bed was super comfortable and I am very fussy when it comes to pillows....they were divine! Approximately 15 mins or so after we had gone into our room, there was a knock at the door. It was one of the staff who looked slightly confused. He apologised profusely as he had been expecting someone else. We were concerned we had been given the wrong room! There was no issue so we thought nothing more and headed back out. Returned at 7.30pm to shower and change before heading out again, and we were greeted with a bottle of sparkling rose and a card, again apologising \"for the disturbance earlier today\".

The central station is within 5-10 min walk, where frequent trains take you to Schiphnol in 15 min.

Yet hotel is not right at the attractions as some other hotels so has less noise and traffic (still facing a major road and easy to find).

A glass table in the middle separates the room into roughly a living area (with a sofa, a coffee table and an armchair) and a sleeping area (a king size bed). I believe this room type is shown in one of the photos on their website and found it inconvenient - this setting forced me to use the glass table in the center of the room but it is too small and my chair cannot move around (it is locked on one side by another desk and at the other side by the coffee table). In room coffee and tea selections are plenty, with a tea kettle and a fancy coffee maker that uses small coffee packets.

Staff is more than friendly. The concierge desk is very helpful in providing all sorts of information and advice. Was greeted every time I entered the hotel or in the hallway. Club lounge on the ground floor is large and provides adequate contiental breakfast with yogourt and cold meat such as salami and turkey. During the day cookies and some small bites are provided.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOne of the simplest and classiest hotels I have visited so far\u201d", "Author": "SagaLEB", "ReviewID": "UR119755639", "Content": "I was a guest at the Crown Plaza City Center in Amsterdam in September 2011. Just before that I was a guest in a Crown Plaza in Antwerp, Belgium. I still have the perspective of the Crown Plazas between two different countries and I have to say there are some big differences. 1- Hotel In General I just love that place. It is so charming and so welcoming. I have been to many luxurious accommodations before but that hotel is just classy and luxurious by being super simple. the lobby is spacious and has all what you need to have a swift quick check in. there is a dedicated Priority Club members desk. they greeted me like a king and my check in was swift and fast. There are two wings in the hotel and at the lobby they are separated by a large living room like area with a large TV in the middle, just a great area to unwind in with a glass of wine after a long day walking around Amsterdam and just before going up to your room. The hallways are a little think but well furnished with carpets which for the first time in my experience, are clean without dust. From outside the hotel is just a great facade of old Amsterdam which blends in its surroundings 2- Location In the middle of Downtown and just 5 minutes on foot from central station, it is really the best located hotel in the city. It is very close to all the attractions yet far enough to have a nice stay away from noisy and loud tourists. The red light district is two blocks away and the greatest cafes and bars are just surrounding the location. If you like shopping, well just walk a couple of blocks and enjoy all what Amsterdam has to offer in shops and markets. I give it a 5 on its location 3- Staff I personally like the simple smiles, they are welcoming and warm to experience when you spend a lot of time traveling. I don't like to be over indulged by compliments (I know you are after my money eventually) and smiley teeth and I also don't like to be greeted like I am a nobody. Well the staff here are surely warm and know how to treat to the fullest without being all around you at every corner. I got greeted by a very welcoming lady on the day of my arrival who has showed me the way to the priority club members desk. The guy in charge of that desk has also been extremely welcoming by making sure that I get checked in in 5 minutes and gave me a wonderful choice of rooms. All were very clear in their explanations, and offered me exactly what I was searching for. Baggage carriers here don;t act like beggars (as is the case in a lots of 5 stars I have visited), they just carry your bags to the room and just make a quiet exit....how can you not tip them in this case? Just a small note...they were not so helpful when I asked them for directions to reach the hotel, yet after check in they were super great in showing me around and offering me the best maps of the city. (Tram, roads...) Compliments to a really good job and really nice warming personnel 4- Rooms I really liked the room I was given. Spacious and super comfortable, the bed large and in the middle offers the best view of the TV. I don;t know what they have done to that bed, but you just sink in it and in between the pillows. You just don;t want to get out. The room has all the amenities you can imagine from a hotel and offers lots of comfort and ease of access to everything. The bathroom is well placed and its access is not obstructed by anything. I liked the balcony, not much of an asset in Amsterdam as it is raining most of the time, but I had the chance to have a great weather so relaxing on that balcony with a bottle of wine and enjoying the wonderful breezes was just magical. The only drawback is that the internet is paid. I am aware that a lot of hotels still charge for it but we are in the 21st century and I truly believe that internet should be free. Finally, I really recommend this hotel to all travelers who want to enjoy Amsterdam. It is a great place to be in. Your will definitely like Amsterdam even more while staying there", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "nottingham", "Title": "\u201cJust Perfect\u201d", "Author": "Tony W", "ReviewID": "UR119677251", "Content": "Stayed 2 nights in a King size room.

We're Priority Club Platinum members and have stayed in numerous CP's over the years. This particular hotel and its staff were among the best, however. The hotel itself is located right in the middle of the city with easy access to all the main sites. There's a tram line that runs right outside the hotel, and Centraal Station is just a short (3 blocks) walk away. The hotel looks as if it's been recently renovated, and all the outlets and rooms are tastefully done. I should mention that the rooms are also \"normal\" sized for Americans, meaning they are substantially bigger than what most European hotels offer. The staff here were absolutely fantastic as well. Each person, from the bellboys who took our bags to the personnel behind the counter to the restaurant staff were extremely friendly and efficient. On two separate mornings we'd overslept and went down for breakfast (in their Club Lounge) with only 10 minutes or so left before closing. We weren't rushed to finish on either day, and in fact they left the buffet open longer simply to accommodate us. Like most of the Dutch, everyone there spoke beautiful English and were able to easily help us find places to go and direct us on how to use the subway. For those interested in using the Club Lounge benefits, I will say that it's smaller than some of the other lounges we've been seen in Crowne Plazas. However, the entire eight days we were there, it was continually stocked with drinks and snacks with relatively few people ever in there at once. We've used other Club Lounges that are noisy and busy (just the opposite of what you generally look for). This particular hotel has wine and beer available for most of the day, but no cocktail hour (with hors d'\u00c5\u201cuvres) like at some other hotels. They do provide a light breakfast in the sanctity of their peaceful little environment there, and we found it more than enough to satisfy us. While the lounge is small, it's very comfortable and offers two computers (along with free printing) and two large screen tv's if you want a break from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Internet is included with the lounge as well (including wi-fi in your room). Overall, we couldn't have been happier with our stay there. The general manager, Mr. Tako Kim Plate, extended a warm welcome to us, and we genuinely felt important to all the staff there.

I was in a Club Room and the bathroom was very small - e.g. you had to shut the door to get anywhere near the toilet, bath or use the sink - a bit of a disappointment. Wi-Fi is expensive as others have noted - you would have thought that Wi-Fi would be free in these modern times or at least much, much cheaper than it is.

The CP Amsterdam is a very nice hotel, centrally located and recently refurbished - rooms and public spaces are in great condition. Location: Absolutely great location, a few minute walk from the Central Station and close to all major hot spots in the city - yet the rooms give a quiet feeling. Great spot for exploring Amsterdam by foot or public transport, not so great if you are by car (which I in general do not recommend in Amsterdam). Priority Club: Big disappointment. As platinum member I did not receive a room upgrade, got a voucher for breakfast for one person for one day only (nice, however my room rate already included breakfast so useless) - the other days were discounted (note that the breakfast is expensive and not worth the money in my opinion) and 20% of their way overpriced internet access. With other words: don't expect anything as priority club member - they do not upgrade to Club access, room upgrades seem rare. Unfortunately there are not many alternatives for PC members apart from the very nice, but very expensive Intercontinental Amstel and Holiday Inn (which is quite far from city center). Rooms & Extras: Rooms were very nice, stylish, media hubs (i.e. USB charger for iPod, laptop could be connected to TV, etc) and very clean. Had a nice view from my room too! Beds were comfortable. Unfortunately, in-room internet is grossly overpriced at 20 EUR per day. For me a reason to might stay somewhere else next time. The connection was also very slow - to give you an idea, it wasn't even possible to stream youtube low quality videos without waiting on buffering all the time. Disappointing! Breakfast was okay, but not worth the 25 EUR (!) they charge for it. Quite a basic spread with limited choice of items for the price they charge for it. Would've expected more. Service: Absolutely great - all staff members (and I have met a lot of them) were very friendly and professional - not a single exception to it. It seems that the hotel spends a great time on training there staff - or they just have a very good hiring policy :) Conclusion: Great hotel, keep in mind that internet + breakfast come extra to nearly 50 EUR a day.

Had all of the amenities of a modern hotel including over priced mini bar, iron, robes, safe and toiletries. Did not interact much with the staff but they all seemed friendly and willing to help if needed. Beds were large and comfy with about 6-8 pillows on each bed. Room was overall very clean and modern looking. Bad point would be the internet access. If you pay for 3 hours at 09:00 it will expire at 12:00 regardless of how much time you were actually online. Most hotels I stay at have a timer on the internet service so if you buy 3 hours you actually get 3 hours of internet time. Considering what you pay for this service it was incredibly disappointing and a complete waste of money if you only need the internet for 10 or 15 minutes at a time.

There is without doubt a 21st century feel to this hotel now, and the quietness of the public areas stood out tremendously. The old Dorrius restaurant is now known as the Queen of Holland Room, and I suspect opens for special functions only. The Dorrius Brasserie which was only open for breakfast and lunch is now renamed The New Dorrius, and all meals are served here. This is also where the bar is located. The seating area outside the old bar is now a \"Living Room\" with a very large seating area with low tables in the middle, and an artificial-flame fire across the width of the area. There are also some seats around the perimiter. On the far wall is an extensive bookshelf, complete with a selection of books to read (many were in Dutch). The small gift shop by the main lifts which also sold daily newspapers is a casualty of the changes, and is no longer there. My room was excellent. Large, and very well appointed. Crucially, and this is the fantastic attention to detail which this hotel pays it's guests, there is a range of international plug sockets available on the desk in the room (in my room at least), so that if you should forget your plug adapter, you need not worry when visiting this hotel. I ate breakfast in the New Dorrius. This has not changed from the offering in the past which I am pleased about. The staff are as ever excellent, and once again I am pleased that some familiar faces still work there, given that staff turnover in many hotels is so high. It's clear that they are content to work in such a fabulous hotel, and their professionalism shines through. The hotel is located just 5 minutes walk from Centraal Station, but if you are looking to use the public transport system in the city, you would be very wise to read up on the new ticketing system now in exclusive use on the trams and buses. The ov-Chipkaart is the equivalent to the London Oystercard, and if used correctly is good value. No other form of ticketing is valid on GVB or Connexxions buses, and in the not-too-distant future this will also be the only acceptable form of ticketing on main line NS trains as well. There is a reasonable amount of construction work taking place around the station as there is a new North/South Metro line being built, but this does not affect the hotel in any way. In summary, my stay was as usual fantastic. Lovely room, beautifully comfortable bed and pillows, quiet room, even though it looked out onto the main road (I could only barely hear the trams outside, but not once did I have any problem getting to sleep, nor did I get awakened by noise outside). The staff were great and the service thoroughly efficient and professional. I can't wait to get back again, but this time I will not leave it so long before doing so.", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cFab location - central but quiet\u201d", "Author": "Scot17", "ReviewID": "UR83350074", "Content": "Really good hotel.

We have never visited the city before and were really looking forward to our visit. This was our anniversary and was a special surprise for myself. My partner had emailed ahead of our visit to the hotel to let them know of the special occasion. Sadly this is where the hotel lost points. I am not saying they had to do anything special. however, every other time we have had a special occasion in one of the same chain of hotels, they have gone out if their way to acknowledge the occasion (the park lane in London even included an upgrade on the room and nibbles and drinks) Again, not vital in the end. Always a nice touch though. More importantly, the position of the hotel is just minutes away from the central station. We didnt have the hotel breakfast due to their being so much choice around the area. A tip I will give for anyone wanting a nice place to sit and snack in the morning. If you come out of the hotel, cross to the next street adjacent. Walk down past the \"gays and gadgets\" store and the Sid street on the right leads to a series of 3 or 4 canal ways. Not only I'd it a gorgeous picturesque walk, but also if you follow to the last canal junction and turn left towards the Anne Frank huis (house) there is a great cafe called roem on the right handside of the canal. Great staff and great price. Try their club sandwich or even the scrambled eggs... Yum The location of the hotel is just fantastic for getting to the different quarters of the city. It's worth getting a hop on hop off canal bus pass outside the central station. If you walk to the bottom of the sane street you get dam square. Also, a nice expensive looking shopping centre on the righthand side. This houses the store called sissy boy (don't be fooled by the name). It's like an upmarket urban outfitters. Some nice clothing and bits for the home. Behind the hotel, is the main street that heads towards the citys centre dam square. And just next to that, is the red light district (wasn't my cup of tea) We found that for wi-fi access around the city. The coffee company chain was useful as they give you a code with each purchase for free wifi access. Some nice coffee aswell. We can't wait to go back again. Largely in part to the hotels service and positioning. As a final tip. A nice little restaurant was \"seasons\" which was about a a ten min walk from hotel towards the roem cafe.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cUsed our free nights here and liked it very much!\u201d", "Author": "Tkids", "ReviewID": "UR82467091", "Content": "We had a room overlooking the street and even though they were soundproof windows, you can somewhat hear the Tram, so bring ear plugs if you are light sleeper.

Plenty of storage space 5. In-room safe easy to operate 6. Plenty of outlets 7. Hairdryer 8. Coffee/tea/biscuits/chocolate/shampoo/soap with additional upon request 9. Prompt housekeeping calls 10. Staff that respects Do Not Disturb sign 11. Ice machine 12. Large bathroom with removable massage showerhead 13. Seemingly comfortable queen bed with feathered down style bedding 14. A free bottle of sparkling water 15. Business centre with internet computers and printers (free) 16. Excellent location 17. Free umbrellas for use (during a rainstorm ugh) 18. Allowed late check out 19. Luggage room for storage prior to departure 20. Fitness room (did not use) THE BAD: 1. Only 1 bottle of sparkling water 2. Internet prohibitively expensive, only 2 business centre computers and one was offline most of the time along with a busted printer 3. Broken umbrellas 4. Plane departed 17:20 checkout only allowed up to 12:30 5. Few other perks or amenities such as a jacuzzi Much nice than the near-by Inntel (formerly Golden Tulip). I stayed at the Inntel not long ago and I will insist that the Crown Plaza is a cleaner, nicer version of the Inntel. Cannot fathom why this hotel is rated #70 when it should easily be #20. Is it the lack of cheap Internet? Use the business centre. If you want to sit in the hotel room and use cheap internet go somewhere else. If you want a free mini-bar go to Grand Amrath. Looking for luxury go to the Intercontinental. Want a funky old bed and breakfast then go to one of the locations rated 1-10. Need a cheap place then stay outside of the centre or in a hostel. This is your typical modern newly refurnished and redecorated US-style Holiday Inn but a Crown Plaza with a little extra such as a nice living room with television and bar/food service for example...but the hotel is not cheap as most things in Amsterdam are not cheap. In the US though you would be paying half the price for a night but I am pretty sure it is because of the expensive nature of Amsterdam city centre.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cVery Impressed\u201d", "Author": "Pau109", "ReviewID": "UR70590597", "Content": "Just spent a night at the Crown Plaza, Amsterdam and were very impressed indeed. Our welcome was excellent with friendly and very helpful, happy staff. They even offered to take our luggage, which is a nice difference to many other hotels in the area. The foyer is large and clean with an odd bar area that is part of the adjacent restaurant. The hotel really could do with a separate bar area. Our room was clean and well appointed. I did think it was a little small though. The bathroom was also small but clean and with a few toiletries. It could do with a few more complimentary soaps and shampoos etc. The bed was large and comfy with plenty of clean blankets. The TV was a good size and had loads of channels to choose from. The complimentary bottle of water was a nice touch, particularly considering the temperature outside. We didn't try the Dutch restaurant as the food didn't seem very attractive and the price was well over the top. There was however an excellent Chinese restaurant across the road, albeit a little expensive too. The hotel lacks a pool however there is a good sized gym and a sauna. In terms of location, the hotel is a few minute walk from Central Station and in an area between the main road and the neighbouring shopping district. It was a little noisy with passing trams and cars etc, but don't let this put you off. Everywhere was a short walk, and in terms of location, we really couldn't fault it. I have stayed in several Amsterdam hotels and I would say this is the best so far. The Moevenpick is on a par however it is located a little too far out of town for my liking.

Also, they gave us free water in the room and we could purchase public transport tickets from the concierge. There was wi-fi available for ~7 Euro/ 1 hour. Steep but they know you need it so they can charge it. I am used to free wi-fi in the US at hotels so it is hard for me to pay for it in Europe. However, we did find some restaurants over there that had free wi-fi so keep checking at each place you eat/drink. The rooms were very nice as were the bathrooms. And, I was worried about noise, but the rooms were very quiet. We stayed here because we could use my husband's points and they treated us just as well as, if not better than, paying customers - they were really nice. However, because I am a smoker, if we would have had to pay for the room, we would have gone to smoke-friendly hotel with one or two rooms set aside for smokers. As it was, I had to go downstairs out the front door where all the traffic, pedestrians and trains were to smoke. Lots of people looking at me in my pajamas, but, that's the sacrifice I made for free room. It was mostly worth it. We never tried the restaurant - out and about too early and late - but it is near all public transport, plus nice walk to Dam square, train station, good bars/restaurants - great location!

Very close to the old town.

Very close to the train station too. About 20 minutes in a taxi from Schipol airport.

The television was set to be watched in several languages including English and the club room we had came with free internet as well. There was a nice gym/workout area with separate saunas for the men and women, which we never used because we were too exhausted from our day and nightlife events we didn't get any gym time in. Location of the hotel was a 5 to 7 minute walk to the train station. Our bed was so comfortable, it was hard to get up in the morning. Upon our arrival, I shared with the staff member that we were celebrating our Anniversary and when we returned to our room the next day (which was our anniversary day) management had left a nice card and chocolates on our bed, wishing us many more years of happiness. I would definitely recommend this hotel to couples on a nice getaway. It is centrally located and easy to get to anywhere in Amsterdam. Though we walked to most of the sites we visited, the tram runs right in front of the hotel. And an added plus was, right outside the hotel was a McDonalds and a local Doner Kebap shop which stayed open til 4am; came in quite handy for the late night returns to the hotel.

It was snowing and bitterly cold, but it was no problem even with the baggage. From the hotel it is a relatively easy and short walk to the city centre and all the main tourist attractions.

We didn't seem able to regulate the temperature too well, leaving the room very warm, especially at night. Staff were ok - not great but certainly not bad. Room service was way overpriced and not the greatest quality - recommend you avoid. Plenty of places nearby for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The hotel has a restaurant but we didn't use it. For winter visitors we recommend the Soup Kitchen, which is literally right opposite the hotel (see google maps street level). They do great soups and sandwich deals for about 5 Euros, just perfect when it was -6 celsius and icy outside!

I don't know if it is hotel staff writing reviews of this hotel. But, this hotel is an absolutely terrible hotel. I urge you not to stay here. My initial reservation was for a 4 night stay. I only ended up staying 2 nights, because this hotel is so poor. Check in at the hotel was very smooth. The front desk staff was very courteous. I go to my room. Upon walking in, the room smelled musty and gave me the impression it had not been opened up in some time. Amsterdam is a very humid city. So, the staff should take care to leave the fan on in the room. The hotel room was small. But, many hotel rooms within Amsterdam are. So, this was not a big issue for me. I did notice that the furniture was very old. The bed was low to the ground. The bed comforter was also very old. I knew immediately that I would not be sleeping under that bed comforter. I proceed to plug in my laptop. There is only one available power outlet in the room. Five minutes after plugging in my laptop, the outlet is no longer charging my laptop. I disconnect the plug and reconnect. Still no power. I ended up having to reach behind the TV to use the power strip, which had one available power outlet. I needed to use the Internet to check e-mail. Upon signing on, I was informed by the sign-on page that 24 hours of Internet use would be $19.95 Euro. I immediately go to the front desk and ask for an explanation of this price. The front desk person told me that he does not set the pricing. I told him that I thought the pricing was excessive for Internet usage. He looked at my room info in the system and told me that I'm eligible for a 20% discount because I'm a Priority Club member. That bit of info still didn't make me feel any better. The desk person then said that I can use the Internet cafe around the corner if I wanted to cheaper Internet. I glare at him for a few seconds and walk away. I go to the bathroom within the room. Immediately upon waliking in I see that the bathroom is in need of an update as well. Fine, no problem. I look at the floors. The floor tile is full of black spots. There is brown mildew in the corner nearest the bathtub. The bathtub and shower are no better. The bath tile was not very clean either. I thought to myself \"disgusting\". I did everything I could to keep my time in the bathroom brief. Once in bed, I could tell the bed was infested with something. My skin kept itching. So, I ended up putting on the included bathrobe and slept in a small corner of the bed for the entire night. The next morning I ask what the hotel's policy is on checking out early. I was told I had to pay them 100 Euro if I did not give them 24 hours advance notice. I went back to my room and did a search for hotels nearby. Once I found one I wasted no time letting the front desk know I would be checking out the next day. That was the worst two nights in a hotel of any hotel I've ever stayed. Do not stay at this hotel.

We would consider staying here again, if unable to find a better-value property.

The location was excellent for this. It is a 10 minute walk from the Centraal Station, so we were easily and affordably able to take a train from the Airport. It is also surrounded by restaurants, shops and small grocery markets. We had no problems finding a place to eat or pick up odds and ends. A 15-20 minute walk in any direction allowed us to see tons of attractions. A possible downside on the location for those families with kids is that it is quite close to the Red Light District which wasn't a problem as our son is so young, but might give rise to interesting questions and conversations if he was older... The facility itself proved to be less than we expected.

Would definitely recommend, based on our experience. At time of booking double room had requested non-smoking, but told that only smoking room available. Took the smoking room, but requested a move to non-smoking if another became available ... didn't hold out much hope, though. On arrival, warmly welcomed, plenty of staff on reception, excellent english and very helpful. Told us that we had automatically been moved to a non-smoking room when one became available, and were allocated rom 201. 201 was right at the end of the corridor - on the plus side, we were only joined to one room, on the minus side the room faced the street. Happy with this, as we tend to find noise comes more from adjoining rooms than outside the hotel. Hotel is situated on a main but not overly busy road - we noticed far more cyclists and trams than cars and this, along with the well insulated room, made getting to sleep at about 11.45 p.m. very easy. Quiet all through the night, too. No-one passes your door to go to their room, so no loud voices and banging doors. Spacious room with two double beds, and plenty of space for clothes, suitcases etc. One long double window, and another in opposite wall, so plenty of light. Small/medium bathroom, fully functional. Room, bathroom, linens etc. spotlessly clean. Hotel is excellently situated for travellers - 5 mins walk from main station in Amsterdam, reachable within 17 mins from Schipol airport. We were in hotel only 35 mins after arriving at schipol railway station. Hotel only a few minutes away from the start of the main shopping lanes, but far enough away from nighttime revellers that there was no noise after midnight. Didn;t try the hotel breakfast - never do, as prefer coffee and rolls in local cafes as part of the experience - but menu was extremely comprehensive and the usual price of 'bit more than you might hope to pay'. In-room tea and coffee making was good. Overall, a really good experience - the staff couldn't do enough to help, providing with maps and directions, keeping our luggage and being unfailingly polite.

Location - This Hotel is convienietnly located near one of the cities entertaining red light districts and is surrounded by those interesting little coffeee houses where you can absorb the pure essence of Amsterdam. An experience not to be missed and the short distance back to the Hotel is an added benefit. Hotel Transport Links - Fortunately a very busy mainroad runs right outside the Hotels front door which makes getting to any part of the city on the numerous Trams or Taxis that travel the road throughout the day and night quick and easy. Hotel clientel - One of the many things that makes staying at a top end luxury Hotel like the Crowns Plaza so interesting and entertaining are the other guests. For instance, when we stayed there were a large group of Brisitsh Hells Angels checking in. What characters they were and despite their fearsome reputation it was a great credit to the staff at the Hotel who laughed and joked with them as if their presence was an everyday occourance, Quite admirable. Hotel Resturant & bar area's - These were fantastic places. Loud, noisy, crowded with a dark, dusky atmosphere that put us right in the mood for a serious evening of clubbing and partying. The restuarants could not have been better with food that was to die for and service was out of this world. In fact we learned that none of the catering staff were locals so 'out of this world' probably explains it. Hotel Staff - What a great bunch of characters, It was so good to see a business establishment providing a chance in life to people from other countries, some of whom did not even understand basic english although they all spoke it to some degree or other. It all added to the foriegn atmosphere. the staff were a great credit to the Management. Hotel Rooms - Contrary to the negative experience of many other guests we had nothing to complain about here although we were probably too bladdered to notice most of the time. But, everything worked & the beds were clean and made each day. Rest in peace we say. Summary - All in all we had a great time and much of that was down to the Crowne Plaza being such a great Hotel.

In fact, at that time it was one of our favourite hotels and could easily hold it's own with other 'superior' hotel in Amsterdam - but not any more. What has changed? Well, with two notable exceptions the answer is absolutely nothing whosoever. The whole place is still stuck in an 80's time warp. It is bland, characterless and depressing with a decor that would not look out of place in a brown on beige 80's Colombo movie. The bedrooms are depressing and unimaginative (don't go there for your honeymoon) - did I say depressing again. In the bathrooms, apart from some peculiar space age soap dispensers (a smart salesman at work here) things have not changed in over 20 years, ugh. The public areas look and feel like an 80's shopping mall of the worse kind and the public rooms have the despairing air of the worst kind of UK motorway service station. So what has not changed? The first surprise is the room rate. It's very, very high indeed. For the 5 stars (how do they judge these things) that the place is definitely not you can get better value elsewhere in Amsterdam by paying far less for far more. The second change is the staff. We are very pleased to report that without exception the ordinary workers in the hotel (all immigrants who no doubt needed the work) were unbelievably efficient, outstandingly helpful and very eager to please. Quite wonderful people ! Unfortunately the exact opposite could be said of the junior so called 'Management' who turned out to be extremely unhelpful, rude, supercilious and arrogant. This must be one of the very few commercial establishments in Europe where the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcManagement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attitude is 'the customer is always wrong'. In summary, if this 'Crowne Plaza' was downgraded to a Holiday Inn it would not do credit to the Holiday Inn brand. However, you will appreciate that this is just our personal opinion based upon staying in literally hundreds of hotels over the past 30 years in dozens of countries in Europe and the rest of the world. So, why not find out for yourself. Book yourself in for a night. Pay the exorbitantly high tariff. Enjoy the un stimulating decor. Explore the depressing public spaces and when you get back to your room put a pillow over your head to block out the realization that you might, just might have made a very expensive mistake. And one last crucial tip for your enjoyment, don't whatever you do expect anything from at least the junior \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmanagement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but ingratitude.

Loads of sights are within walking distance, along with shops, restaurants, Dam Square etc etc. The hotel has a small gym (with temperamental machinery!) however it was pretty good to get up in the morning and do a workout then go for a dip in the pool (quite small and a little chilly but this just encouraged you to swim faster!) and then relax in the sauna (these are situated in the changing rooms so are single sex only). There was the usual variable room service - sometimes you got your water refreshed, sometimes not, sometimes they gave you more toiletries, sometimes not but as usual in hotels if you ask one of the chamber maids for something they are more than happy to get it for you.

I would say it was only twelve by twelve and the sauna is also miniscule-We managed to squeeze only 4 n at a time! However all that I could live with, the hotel staff were another matter! At one stage I thought there must have been a stage in the interviewing process for cowne plaza where they tested the snotty looks and condescending attitudes of their staff because here at Amsterdam city centre, they have these qualities down to a tee! We had arranged our booking through a friends and family discount of which we hadn't been gievn a white card. We arranged for the hotel in the UK to fax through TWO statements saying we were entitled to the discount which 'apparently' were never received dispite the UK hotel having accepted receipts and confirming the number with the amsterdam reception. In the midst of this the staff were rude, laughed when we were clearly upset with the situation and not once offered any assistance in receiving the confirmation! A simple call to the UK was too much for them. Finally on the second to last stay we were granted an audience with the duty manager who was also exceptionally off hand sharp with us and finally agreed to call the UK. Fianlly the fax was received and we were able to relax that we would only have to pay the rates we had initially agreed to when making the booking. I could almost understand the attitude if we were a huge group of loud and brash girls but in no way were we. We were considerate of other visitors and polite to everyone. Maybe that was the problem for the staff here at the crowne plaza amsterdam-they thought polite behaviour was just too abnormal. Worse still, I paid in cash for the rooms at the end of the stay and when I returned home, I found I had been charged on my debit card for all three rooms (my card was used for only one room) for the full rate! Has taken a week to organise the refund and am exceptionally grateful i kept the receipt.

Shops don't take credit cards without ID. Shop assistants are very snotty and delight in asking for ID, which if you have any sense is usually safely locked up in the hotel safe. Make sure if you go shopping with cc you have ID. Also the ticket machines for trains at the airport and Central Station don't take Visa credit cards and very few take notes (weird system and not conducive to tourists) Make sure you have change.

We had ordered a non-smoking room, but didn't get one - we asked at reception and were given the impression that guests didn't overmuch pay any attention to the non-smoking rules anyway; the bathroom had a fairly strong smell of dried urine about it and the windows didn't open, all of which added up to a room that could have done with a bit of an airing. The Club Level Lounge was pretty good - free cold breakfast, free drinks. The view wasn't quite as astonishing as the hotel's publicity might lead you to believe - more worth a curious glance than the sort of balcony you might choose to spend hours on, watching the slightly drunken youths down below make their way into the chinese restaurant across the road - and it should be noted that the lounge is only accessible through a climb up a spiral staircase, so might not be an option for people with mobility problems. The main breakfast buffet is good - although, to be honest, probably more on a par with what you'd expect at a Marriott Courtyard in the US than a Crowne Plaza in Europe, and as such only just about qualifying as value for money. The staff are what make the hotel, though, and here they went out their way to be helpful. The other great plus is the proximity to trams and the central station (the hotel recommends a ten Euro cab ride from the station, but it's really just a step or two across the road.)

The Crowne Plaza was a lovely relaxing hotel with excellent room service, a nice quiet bar and restaurant and a buffet breakfast second to none. The breakfast is \"all you can eat\" and has a large variety of fruits, cerials, yoghurts, pastries and breads plus the cooked section. Wonderful, and breakfast is open from 06:30 to 11:00 hours so there is plenty of scope for those early risers and those lazy snoozers, such as ourselves. The pool in the hotel is cool and relaxing and there are saunas in the changing rooms. With internet access also, the hotel truly was a fantastic place to stay. The hotel is placed in an excellent location within easy walking distance from Dam Square, the red light district and Centraal Station We thought that we would try a kinky location and with the legalised red light district, we decided that Amsterdam would be more kinky than most. In truth, commercialised sex is actually very dull. We went on an organised Red Light tour which is well worth the Euros. Not only did it give us a flavour and an interesting perspective on \"the oldest trade\" but it also gave us a good grounding for finding our bearings in the maze of streets, alleys and canals. Personally I think that the oldest trade must be farming but I am wrong apparently. If, however, farming is your bag, there are plenty of organised tours of cheese farms etc. Many people recommend the sex show, Cassa Rosso but I really wouldn't bother. It seemed like a stale show full of stag parties and they bring customers in and out at such a constant rate that it does detract from the \"show\". Not worth it, in my opinion. Spend your 45 Euros each on a nice meal instead. The drugs scene is alive and well in Amsterdam and it is tourism that the locals would rather not have. As well as the legalised \"coffee shops\" there is no shortage of sellers on the street offering harder drugs than cannabis. We have never been into hard or soft drugs and the proliferation of what appeared to be zombies was quite disconcerting. So many people were spaced out it was unreal. Many of these were riding around carelessly on bicycles. With the combination of cannabis, bicycles, trams, canals and the distraction of \"window brothels\" I am suprised that there are not more serious accidents. Rembrant Square seems to be a much rougher part of the city and we were approached by beggars on 3 occasions. I personally witnessed 2 crimes take place in this area and we did not feel safe in this location, despite hoards of other tourists. The red light area was safer. I would avoid Rembrant Square. Many people recommend trams and river taxis to get about but we went more or less everywhere on foot and nothing was too far away. If you are going to visit Anne Frank's house, get there early to avoid the queues. Madamme Tussauds is also a very good attraction to visit and we would recommend this too. In short we highly enjoyed our Amsterdam visit but it was made all the more special by The Crowne Plaza.", "Date": "July 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, UK", "Title": "\u201cLovely central location\u201d", "Author": "prcwood", "ReviewID": "UR5440725", "Content": "Location is great, right by Central Station and 2 mins walk to Dam Square.

The biggest positive of this hotel is the proximity to Centraal Station and Amsterdam's main attractions (i.e. Dam Square, shopping, Red Light District, Anne Frank House). Everything is within walking distance. From the train station, exit to the southwest (right hand side of the station if you're facing the city), and walk up N.Z. Voorburgwal. Roughly 2 blocks - very easy. Unfortunately, when you get to the Hotel, you will soon discover what so many other reviewers have already: this place is worth about half of what it charges. My wife and I paid 249 euros (plus another 5% tax not included in this rate) for a room that was about the equivalent of an older Best Western or Holiday Inn in the US. Although well maintained by housekeeping, the decor was clearly from the 1980s and is in bad need of an upgrade. For 249 euros, I expect a certain wow factor and this place just doesn't deliver. In summary, if this place went for 159-179 euros per night, I'd highly recommend it. The hotel is fine in many respects: helpful front desk, in room iron/ironing board, wash clothes, & nice indoor pool. Nice touches that are important to me as a traveler. However - just not worth 249 euros per night. A couple of final thoughts on Amsterdam... tickets for the trolley/tram system can be purchased at the Hotel front desk. They aren't available at any of the stops other than those at Centraal Station. This thing isn't nearly as user friendly as the public transport in Paris/London/Munich/etc. and having these strips will make your life much easier. Secondly, the hotel offers self-service laundry in the basement. Cost is 5 euros per machine and includes soap for the washer. There's also a laundromat just up the street from the hotel (towards Dam Square) if you are looking for something a little more economical and don't mind walking a bit.", "Date": "June 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcestershire", "Title": "\u201cVery good\u201d", "Author": "thirty3", "ReviewID": "UR5347226", "Content": "Stayed June 10-13th in a club room which was well worth the extra cost - breakfast included, free minibar, free beer, wine, soft drinks and nibbles in the air conditioned 'club lounge' on the rooftop which also has a pleasant terace with reasonable views.

One tip for future travellers : avoid Queens Day ( April 29 in 2006) if you want to explore the city or worse still, leave the city on that day.

We booked two rooms as we took my parents over for a short break. Prior to booking in February, we looked at Tripadvisor and saw some very mixed reviews. Some were good, but most found fault with the staff and general standard of decor / bathrooms within the hotel. Being Priority Club members and regular contributors to sites such as this, we wrote to the hotel and asked for their comments in response to the previous negative reviews. We received an immediate response from the reservations manager who addressed each of the issues in turn and explained that by the time we arrived in September most (if not all) problems would be resolved. We got the opportunity to book our room at a discount rate on the IC web site so thought we would take a chance. Upon arrival, we were greeted by an efficient concierge who took all our luggage and escorted us through to check in. The desk staff were friendly and helpful. Once I had introduced myself, I was reffered to by name (as all priority club members should be) and the whole check in procedure was seemless and simple. We arrived at our rooms to find the luggage inside and waiting. We booked superior club rooms and found both rooms to be clean, well presented and spacious (by Amsterdam standards). Both rooms had windows that opened and we had no smoke related problems that others seem to have experienced. Our deal included free minibar (less spirits) and access / use of the club lounge facilities. We had a super breakfast out on the club lounge terrace on the 6th floor overlooking the city and found the continental breakfast selection to be more than adequate. We did order a sandwich and fries for lunch on room service. The service was prompt but the sandwich was a little bland and not really the sort of thing you expect for the money. We did look at the pool and Gym but were too busy to use them on this visit. I did note that the pool was available for use 24 hours a day which is a big plus I noted for future visits. All in all, we were more than a little worried before coming over. From what we saw, there is clear evidence that a large amount of effort has been given into improving the hotel and staff. It is not the best hotel in Amsterdam (You cannot really look past the Amstel) but it did represent very good value for money and it has a super location if you want to drop out of your room straight into the heart of the city.

I booked this through Hotels as the rate was much better than the hotel was offering if you booked direct. The hotel is set right in the heart of the city 10mins gentle walk from Central Station, so don't bother with a cab. The concierge was very good, really new his stuff and gave us a few good tips. Some entrance tickets are cheaper if you buy them from the hotel than the venue itself. Only thing I didn't like was that the hotel room was really warm, even with the thermostat turned right down and you couldn't open the windows.", "Date": "March 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cFair Service\u201d", "Author": "87", "ReviewID": "UR3097230", "Content": "Stayed here on January 22 for three nights. I paid 125 Euros per night, which is a fair price. The hotel staff at the front desk were indifferent and seemed to be bothered by customer interruptions. I stay in Amsterdam regularly but this was the first time I had to wait until 3pm to get my room. Even though I am a Platinum member of the Priority Club, I was not offered an upgrade on my room. I moved out after three nights since the room rate doubled.

We were offered an upgrade to a club room for \"just\" 70 euro per night. What the heck -- we were in Amsterdam on holidays, we went for it. And what a deal it was. Unlimited use of the minibar (really!), pay movies at no extra charge, use of the very nice (but usually messy) club room, free wireless internet and more. Well worth the US$100 or so per night. Room was at the back of the hotel facing another building (i.e lousy view), but that was fine since we had probably the quietest room in the hotel. I'd ask for the same room again! Hotel is centrally located with a tram stop just down the block about 100 meters. Concierge staff was incredible. Very informative, spent lots of time with us and were able to sell us tickets for just about anything worthwhile to see in AMS. The Amsterdammer Bar at the hotel was great. Friendly bartender (thanks for that 15-year old Geneveer shot -- it hit the spot!) and entertaining people watching along one of the main shopping streets in the city. Room was small, but certainly large enough for the two of us. I'd read the previous reviews about mold and mildew in the bathroom tiles and didn't really believe it until I saw it! But it wasn't a huge deal when compared to the friendly staff, good location and decent Internet rate that we received.

The room was spacious with an interesting, but not spectacular, view of the street below. Good for people watching but not awe-inspiring. The room was cleaned daily very well. The water was hot and the pressure strong, and with plenty of soap, shampoo, etc. The staff was by and large friendly and helpful. The buffet, though expensive, is delicious and plentiful. I've seen rankings of it as a \"Five Star Hotel\" -- be aware that it is not a U.S. 5 star hotel, but I would give it a U.S. 4 star ranking. As far as Amsterdam hotels go, I believe it is a 5 star. The lobby is beautiful and well maintained. The restaurant and bar are good. All in all, a great hotel with no complaints whatsoever.

We knew that we wanted to stay around the area where the CP was. We were looking for 2 adjacent rooms and were able to get a reasonable price - not much more than the previous.
