The hotel looks fairly new and modern. One little quirk, as mentioned before, is that you go from street level in a dedicated elevator to the reception/bar/dining area on the 7th floor then take another lift down to whichever floor you are staying. In our case the 2nd. It would have been easier to use the stairs but I suppose security deemed this necessary. The room was neat and we had a sort of kitchen that looked like a wardrobe, behind the room door. We didn't actually notice it until we asked where our mini bar was as we couldn't find it in the usual place. The mini kitchen had a fridge and cooker and sink. Different!! Only one minor gripe. Suprisingly for a new building, there was no A/C. There was a fan in the room but as it was about 30C last weekend it was a bit stuffy. Staff all very pleasant and all spoke english. Breakfasts were great. Choice of the usual bacon, egg type things and extensive range of fruits, bread and cold meats/cheeses. The wasps found the meat particularly appealing.. As the weather was fine we ate on the outdoor roof terrace which was a bonus. Great for public transport. If you fly into Schoenfeld, take the S9 train (2.60 euros one way...a bargain) and get off at Charlottenburg..just behind the hotel. It takes about 45 minutes. To travel about this lovely city I would recommend getting a day ticket from any station or bus etc. which costs 5.80 euros and you can use the overground and underground trains, buses and trams unlimited. The city covers a large area so no matter where your hotel is you'll probably do a fair bit of travelling around on public transport which appears to me to be plentiful.
