Only bad thing is that you don't have night trains, but I was too tired of walking through the city that I had no strength to stay at night :) Also, 3 train stops in opposite direction from center of Rome and you are on beach :) Definitely go to Ladispoli!! Anyways, hotel is great - big rooms, very clean, bathroom also, big restaurant, good food, big fantastic pool..Reception staff was exceptionally polite, very friendly and very professional.

I was nervous about staying here after seeing the reviews but hotel choice was out of my control. We had a suite that fit 3 people. It was very large and the maid provided extra towels and soaps knowing that there were 3 people staying in the room. Our room's air conditioning was not that good so our room stayed pretty warm throughout our stay. I saw other rooms that people in our group were staying in and they were ok. They were smaller but overall not that bad. I do not suggest eating at the hotel. As mentioned in previous reviews, the staff is not the friendliest and they don't look happy with their job. The food at the hotel was ok. The breakfast was very light as most Italian breakfasts are. The hotel is not in a convienient location to downtown Rome, but since we were with a group and we had a bus we could live with it. The pool area is very nice. There were lots of chairs and they had a bar. The only downside is that you have to use the towels from your room. Many of the other reviews say that there is lots of mold, however I did not see mold anywhere during our stay. The wi-fi is free but it only really works well in the lobby.

To get to the Spanish Steps, we needed to take a bus and transfer to a Metro A line. And to travel to the Vatican, we needed to take yet another mode of transportation, which was a train and it was not the metro. The Hotel is on top of a hill requiring a good 8-10 minute walk from the hotel to the main road which means if you walk down, you must also walk up after a full day of walking. Then, to top it off, the hotel itself is old, smelly, and full of mold. The elevator did not work so we had to drag our baggage up the stairs to get to the floor. The stairwell walls were very dirty, scuzzy, and carpeting was very warn out. Once we got to our floor, the carpeting which was attached to the lower portion of the wall, was falling off. Then, we entered the room and what a surprise. The shower area was full of mold everywhere. I was very concerned with what I saw. Although, the ratings are different in Italy than in the US, it deserved maybe a 1 if even that. The TV did not have any english speaking channels and had access to maybe 3 channels. Unfortunately, we did not have access to the news. The shower was situated in such a way that it was difficult to get into and out of the stall. Had to raise legs at least 2 feet in order to get in. It would be very difficult for an elderly person to get in and out. The food was also bad -- but because it was a tour we did not have choices of dishes we were being served. Either way, the staff serving the food was not very pleasant, and we were always waiting for them to bring out coffee, which we had to serve ourselves anyway. To sum it up -- it is inconvenient, lacks personality or old style charm that I have seen in Rome on previous trips, and they really need to get rid of the mold.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ankara, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cTerrible Terrible Terrible\u201d", "Author": "dantecik", "ReviewID": "UR87968153", "Content": "Everything is terrible about this hotel.

You would expect the mattress NOT to feel like it needed to be changed a few years ago. You would expect towels that still have thread to them, a shower that does not consist of a showerhead in a bath with a flimsy screen. Above all, you would NOT expect to smell whatever other clients do in their toilet, and I mean: whatever.... The pool. For a start, it is not cleaned daily. There is a grand total of two umbrellas available for about 30 loungers. There is no towels provided, you are requested to use your room's towels, and have to pay a \u20ac5 surcharge to get them changed afterwards. It is cold and usually noisy from sound checks for the daily evening private party (this hotel caters mostly for parties and conferences). The food. Unbelievable but true, it is worse than the rest. The \u20ac22 buffet option offers a bad selection of salad, one awful hot dish with as little meat as they can get away with, and some days no dessert (or they keep it in the kitchen, you have to ask for it, the waiter then has to ask his manager for permission to bring you what you have paid for). Coffee is as bad which is a rare occurence in Italy. I was not brave enough to try the wine.... The service. With a couple of exceptions in the restaurant, the rest of the staff clearly hate their job and make sure you do know about it. The location. Yes, as per the other reviews, awful.

While, apparently, the site I was on showing a shuttle from the hotel to the Metro was not their's and doesn't happen unless you contact them prior (no mention of that in the ad I saw, the ad I saw gave a time table).

Did not eat at hotel restaurant - too expensive. We went to the nearby supermarket - down the hill, turn right, across the bridge - 5-10 mins. We bought cooked chicken and a salad and had a picnic by the pool. If you are reasonably fit (we are in our 60's), the walk down the hill from the hotel is easy. You can turn right at the bottom to the bus stop and catch the bus to Cornelia station, but it is a lot quicker to turn left and walk under the subway to Aurelia station. Trains run every hour (10 mins to the hour when we were there). every 2 hours on Sundays and holidays. Pay on the train. We did not take the hotel shuttle into Rome. There is a shuttle bus to Fiumicino airport. We paid 35 Euros for a taxi to Ciampino airport. DO NOT let reception order a taxi for you - they will charge you 25% more (at least). If you just go outside the hotel, taxis arrive all the time. Wait for one and ask him to pick you up at the time you need - he will come back. This is not a 4 star hotel, but we found it OK for our needs. By the way, airfares back to North America from Rome are expensive. You can go to England on Easyjet or Ryanair for about $50.

No explanation why the hotel did not tell us it was a holiday they day we arrived and that trains were not running and bus service was limited. Very frustrating first day. The restaurant service was impossibly slow as they catered to a wedding party and ignored us. Food was tasteless. The hotel definitely needs TLC, reasonably clean but beds were like rocks. The destination requires you to work at going into town as they only make 4 trips a day to Cornelia station - 2 in the morning, and 2 at night. Definitely not at request. They only want you to use their taxi reference, and there are less expensive cabs. There is a supermarket 10 minutes away and you can get water, pizza, fish, water, beer, ice cream etc there. The hotel is located a ten minute walk from the bus stop, and the hotel is at the peak of fairly steep driveway which for some might be a problem. Not negotiable - we asked for some consideration due to the lack of airport shuttle, and other misunderstandings but the staff there do not seem inclined to finding solutions to make tourists happy before they leave. I guess there are enough tourists who don't do research. The location is not way out of town though, it is only a short bus ride or short taxi ride into old Rome.

Either I stayed at the wrong hotel, or they need their eyes tested!!! On my recent experience, I'd say its struggling to maintain a 2-star rating! We found the hotel staff to be courteous, polite and helpful, but it was all downhill after that. The room(s), whilst kept clean, had very dated decor. The en-suite bathroom was minute, with no room to swing a kitten, let alone a cat! The TV in our room was perched on top of the mini-bar, the remote was broken, and was never fixed during our stay, despite repeated requests. There were/are no facilities inside the rooms to make tea or coffee. Breakfast was basically a self-service cold buffet, with runny 'scrambled' eggs and bacon. Evening meals were an 'adventure' because despite ordering from the menu, we often received what the the chef 'thought' we had ordered. The portions sizes were suitable for a 10-year old, unfortunately we couldn't find any 10-year olds to give our meals to! The hotel is at the top of a hill, if you miss the am or pm shuttle to Cornelia metro station, there is a 10-minute walk to the bus-stop. Not so bad in the morning when going out, but a real chore in the evening when returning after a days sight-seeing. The shuttle was unpredictable as despite having a time-table, one day it would leave later than the scheduled time, the next day it would leave as per the time-table, so you never quite knew where you were. The Hotel has a swimming pool, but it wasn't clean, and we never saw anyone in it, despite some very hot days during our stay. If you are visiting Rome, its probably worth spending the extra to get a hotel closer to the centre. It makes sight-seeing, and travelling around a lot easier. If you must stay on the outskirts of Rome, we would not recommend staying here!!! Tourist Tip (i): When purchasing a 'multi-ticket' for combined metro & bus travel, they are available from the metro stations. however, the metro has no booking office staff, only ticket machines. The ticket machines only take the exact money for the required ticket, despite saying they give change, they don't! Also, we found that you can actually just walk through the metro gates to get down to the platform. Whilst there are machines you are supposed to 'swipe' your ticket through on both the metro and buses, after a while we 'did as the Romans do' and just got on the metro and buses without 'swiping' the ticket through the machine. Tourist Tip (ii): When visiting the Vatican, the early morning queues are long (try and get there by 8am), don't be conned by tour guides offering a fast-track entry, \"Within 10-minutes of the doors opening\", they say . They will charge \u20ac27.00 on top of the standard \u20ac13.00 Vatican entry price. Only go with a guided tour if you genuinely want to, and not just to get inside quicker. Once the doors open at 10am, and the queue starts to move, you will be inside pretty quick.", "Date": "May 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cSummit Roma Should Be Downgraded to 2 Star\u201d", "Author": "millerLondon", "ReviewID": "UR7634365", "Content": "Upon arrival at the hotel the reception staff were very helpful but the service from the bar and restaurant staff was to say the least appalling they gave the impression that they really did not want to be bothered by quests.

However, we ended up at the wrong one, and when I asked the driver how we could get to the correct one, he simply said \"it's not my problem, you should have checked\" and then turned his back on me! This was also the attitude of the unhelpful reception staff when we got back to the hotel. There was no help whatsoever and they refused to give us the hotel manager's name. What was even more ludicrous was the fact that the bus had to practically go past the correct airport on the way back to the hotel but because it \"wasn't his route\" he wouldn't take us. Luckily we made our flight by the skin of our teeth; the other party (with a baby) weren't so lucky...so all in all, the hotel was let down by the terrible quality of the customer service and rudeness of the driver (who incidentally only understood English when it suited him!)", "Date": "May 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cvery hard to find\u201d", "Author": "yoda69", "ReviewID": "UR3395378", "Content": "Finding the hotel was a bit of a nightmare, the easiest way is to get the over ground train to Stazione Roma.

The following observations were made, This hotel is WELL WELL OUT OF THE WAY from the centre of Rome. The nearest station to it is Cornelia Metro station. There is a free shuttle bus that runs to this station from the hotel but be warned there is high chance there won't be enough room for you on the bus as spaces are limited, so you'll have to get a taxi ( 10 Euros) up to Cornelia station as they don't do a second runs. The metro line closes at 9 pm so if your planning a late night in the centre of Rome be prepared to cough up the 25 Euros back to the hotel by taxi. (Thanks for telling us that hotel people not! ) Also the last free shuttle service from Cornelia station to the hotel is at 8pm. The rooms are basic and if you like sleeping on plywood you'll love the beds. The showers have no shower curtains, so having a shower brings a new meaning to the term 'wet room '. Next time I'll take my snorkle and flip flops. The shuttle bus service times aren inconsistent, our room had ants and toilet flooded when there was a problem with the drains on more than one occasion. I am pleased to say that the hotel did not spoil my trip to Rome. It was beautiful city full of charming people and wonderful places visit just DON'T stay in this hotel.", "Date": "March 18, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Summit Roma Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d229082-Reviews-Summit_Roma_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$106 - $270*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "229082", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/46/57/4657d26aa06449914bbfc5b06fc77cd26large.jpg"}}
