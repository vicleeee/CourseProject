Here central means just that - no need for taxis or buses, so more time to spend seeing what you came for. The hotel is very old and although it could do with a bit of TLC in some parts, it has everything a visitor to Rome needs. Standing outside the hotel door, you may decide to turn right. Just a few feet away you have the entrance to Trajan's Markets, down a flight of steps takes you to his column and there you are, looking out at the Vittorio Emmanuel Monument (make your own mind up about that...). Head left and amble past the Forum towards the Colosseum. If you decide to take a left out of the hotel, make for the little archway - within 5 minutes you will have reached the Trevi Fountain and 15 minutes on from there, the Piazza di Spagna. When you've had your fill of culture for the day and the feet are throbbing, grab a bottle of wine you may have bought from one of the local shops and head up to the terrace of the hotel. The views from here are absolutely breathtaking. Comfortable tables and chairs (and a hammock) are laid out and are perfect for seeing the city's rooftops. The 360 degree view allows you to take in the sights - far beyond the Colosseum you can see the Alban hills in the distance, in front the domes of the churches and the biggest of them all St Peter's. Depending on the time of year wait on the terrace for the arrival of the starlings - millions of them making their way to the trees on the Janiculum Hill providing a stunning display of aerobics before they finally swoop down to roost. I have stayed at the Pace Helvezia many times and it has taken me sometime to write this review as I have wanted to keep it to myself.

The receptionist told us each morning the same thing - that there was no chance to change rooms, he was sorry that the aircon didn't work, and that he would organize a fan. One never materialized. On the last night, the electricity went out across the whole hotel, and we had to lay damp towels across the pillow to keep cool - as my mum is in her seventies, none of this was acceptable.

Compared to the others, this was nowhere near the quality, and I struggle to see how it justifies it's star rating. When we walked in the door, we knew we were in trouble.... no staff, small one-man reception, faded decor, no bell-hop for the luggage, no restaurant - but it was in a nice location, or so we thought. Receptionist explained that we could not have a room higher than 2nd floor, as Citalia wouldn't allow UK guests higher (to do with safety laws and fire escapes I think - read into that what you may!). When we reached our rooms, the air-con didn't cool below 20deg C (while our children's room went to 16deg) and the staff said that was how it should work! - no attempt to come and fix or even see the problem - the room was in poor repair (telephone socket dangling from a cable and not fixed to the wall), not properly cleaned, and above all excessively noisy (right on main road with traffic thundering by, and all through the night apparently). We asked to change rooms, and were offered another that was little better, but smelt of mildew. To their credit, Citalia changed us without cost to another in the same group, the Eliseo, immediately. We lasted one night there, not the three we'd booked for, as at 1230 am, the aircon sprung a leak right outside our door. The sole staff present (4*?) decided that he could only put a (leaking!!!!) bucket under the constant drip.... when asked whether we could change rooms, the answer was no, none available. When asked why he didn't call a maintenance man out on emergency cover, he explained that he was the only person on site, and had no emergency number to call for assistance - they were all asleep (unlike us....). Apparently the hotel chain has 17 hotels in Rome, but doesn't feel that they need to serve their guests properly by investing in sufficient staff. I empathise with the other posts that state that the hotels we have seen here are not 4* - they may once have been, but it felt to me that this is a chain of hotels that should be avoided at all costs. I would never go back. Admittedly, it may have been a one-off experience, so read through the posts (for Eliseo too) and see whether you want to take the chance... My comment to Citalia is that they should send a mystery guest to stay, and then decide if they want to still feature this as a 4* hotel.

The hotel itself is fine - not luxury but who is going to spend a great deal of time indoors in Rome?? the rooms may be small compared to some, but all was clean and the breakfast was good, (only gripe was machine coffee - yuk). As said before the roof terrace is fantastic and gives you a sense of Rome in all its glory! Watch out for the beggars, like most big cities Rome has its fair share, my husband came close to losing his wallet - a group of 3-4 women surrounded him, tried to hold onto his arms whilst one went into (almost) his pockets - BE WARNED, they seem to target men because obviously most won't fight back!

Our 4 day stay was very enjoyable and I would not hesitate to stay here again. Room #94 for 4 days Sept. 10-14 2009 @ $164 EUR per day $656 EUR total, but we booked through Venere and received a 4% discount at check out. I loved every minute of our stay and must say the staff was friendly and professional in every way. Breakfast included various meats, cheeses, breads, cereals, eggs (hard boiled) yogurts, fresh fruit, pastries, juices and of course espresso and cappuccino etc. The roof top terrace is not to be missed. Our room had a small balcony with lime trees all around which was nice. We also rented a scooter and rode to Lido di Ostica for a fun day at the beach.

That is the ONLY positive aspect of this truly terrible hotel. It is the worst hotel experience i have ever had - and being a banker from London I travel quite a bit (and not only to typically posh hotels & places). What to expect if staying at the Pace: * As our prebooked taxi, organized by the hotel, did not show up at the airport we called the prebooked taxi to let him know and then took a regular taxi from airport to the hotel. We paid EUR 40, and would otherwise have paid EUR 50 with the hotel taxi (...). The incredibly RUDE receptionist ( ) then told us that we had to pay the EUR 50 for the prebooked taxi as his friend, the taxidriver, had indeed been at the airport. When I told him that I had actually called him and spoken with him, the receptionist said I was LYING. As i showed him my mobile phone with the dialed number he still didnt believe that i had actually called and spoken with the taxidriver - as i could simply have called up and hung up.. USE a normal taxi from airport for EUR 40! More about the subsequently grumpy receptionists later. * After such check-in we got took the SCARY small and run-down lifts up to our room. It was small, stuffy, with two separate beds (we requested one), with a non-functioning shower and a lounge chair that fell appart when sitting in it. It was also unbearably LOUD so impossible to sleep at night as we were not able to move room the first night. * The breakfast is ok as long as you like DRY bread and pastries, old milk, ready-made machine coffee and a factory-like ambiance amongst other equally UPSET hotel guests. * The hotel is in a really BAD condition, the paint is falling from the walls, the carpets are stained & furniture (or lack of) in main areas are really poor. A shame as the building itself has some potential, a roof that could be used for nice terrace and a decent location. * After a few days sightseeing the beautiful Rome, we came again to check out for ourselves and our parents room. BEWARE, In truly DODGY style, another receptionist then tried yet again to RIP US OFF by overcharging us by EUR 450. He simply would not accept that 350+450 was not equal to 1250 EUR...and it took us some 10 minutes of arguing before he simply accepted our \"low\" payment, never apologizing for having made an error.

The breakfast was reasonable with no complaints. I have been to Italy about 100+ times so I know breakfast in Italy isn\u00b4t something they are very good at, but it\u00b4s reasonable. The main reason for choosing Pace Helvezia is the great location, which is close to everything within walking distance. 5 minutes stroll to Trevi Fountain, and 10 minutes to the Spanish Steps. The roof top terrace is absolutely breathtaking and nearly empty all the time. 360 degrees view and one of the highest roof tops in the area. And excellent place to finish off a long days walk with a cold bottle of Prosecco, and watch the skyline in Rome. Unfortunately, the bar was closed as it would have been nice to order something. September is high-season in Rome and therefore the bar should have been open for the guests. Yes, the two elevators might be small, which only fit 3 people. But they do have two elevators and not just one. One should note that every single hotel in Rome is NOT to be compared with, say, hotels in Florida, California or even Scandinavia. Hotels in Rome are smaller due to the age of the city so it\u00b4s unjustifiable to complain about room size, facilities and super luxury. Hotel Helvezia is rated as a four star hotel, and judging by the hotel standard in Rome Hotel Helvezia is worth of its four stars \u2013 especially taking the room price into account (Euro 111.50 per night), as well as the location, and the outstanding roof top. As Rome is an extremely busy city traffic wise there are noise coming into to the rooms adjacent to Via V Novembre. I\u00b4m sure more modern sound proof windows could solve this problem in the future. However, I didn\u00b4t encounter any significant issues with the noise as I live in a busy city already.

We should have read the reviews on Trip Advisor before booking! This is said to be a 4 star hotel - HOW? There is nowhere in the hotel to get a hot drink, no bar, a cold breakfast which is not particularly appertising, the lifts are so small they profess to take 3 or maybe 4 (different signs on each side of the lift!) At one point we took the lift to our third floor room (6 flights of stairs) and it got stuck with only two average size people in it. Luckily I managed to prize the door open as nobody answered the alarm bell and my wife was beginning to panic. The lifts were not used again after this incident on the second day. You had to pay for a safety deposit box per day - this is not what you expect for a four sstar hotel. How do they do their ratings? To say it was noisy is understated. The room was at the back of the hotel (dull and dingy) and the a/c did not work and in order to get some air into the room we opened the window. Eventually we had to shut this as a road sweeper seemed to take forever cleaning a small car park at the rear of the hotel (with cars) at ridiculouse times of the night 2.00 a.m., 3.00 a.m. 4.00 a.m. The only saving grace for this hotel is the ideal location. We walked to all the main attractions, colliseum, pantheon, trevi fountation and spanish steps but had to catch the bus to the vacitcan city as we were not sure of the route. Again, if it had not rained you could have walked although this would have taken about 20-30 minutes. Don't let this put you off visiting Rome. A beautiful place and well worth a visit.

I just happened to realize the water was around my ankles, quickly found the drain, and pulled the drain out so water could drain. Two other companions said the same thing happened in their shower -- beware! Breakfast room was nice, but small. We found the same cheeses, breads, cereals, meats, fruit as in other hotels. The waitress was VERY friendly and attentive -- a plus. The best part of this hotel was the rooftop view. We purchased a few bottles of wine and took them to the rooftop for our farewell party.

It was 24/25 degrees and was simply stunning. We booked the Pace Helvezia through a hotel search engine and read the (rather mixed) reviews of the hotel through Trip Advisor. We were a mixed party of 14 and had booked 7 rooms at 230 Euros per night. We found the hotel, and the service from the reception staff to be excellent, and our rooms were provided promptly on arrival although we had arrived to check in at 11.30am (the hotel check in is 1.00pm). We were actually provided with an upgraded room (102) which surely must be one of the best in the hotel. It has a fantastic balcony with stunning views across to Palazzo Vict Eman. and Piazza Venezia and was immediately adjacent to the access to the roof top terrace. The terrace as other reviewers have said, is just incredible and with views in all directions has to be one of the best hotel locations in Rome. Although there is no bar on the roof terrace the hotel are quite happy for you to take your own drinks up there (or empty your mini bar from your room!) and it really is a must do after a day of sightseeing. All our party were happy with the hotel although the rooms on the lower floors were noisy. We had asked for, and were provided with, rooms on the back of the hotel, as we had read other reviews suggesting this. There is clearly a problem with the plumbing as the showers do tend to run hot and cold intermittently, and if staying for several days this could become very annoying. Finally on a not so positive note, the breakfast was very poor. When you are paying a high room rate is it too much too ask for a generous choice of breakfast ? The stated times for breakfast are 7.30 to 10.30am but at 9.30am we offered an extremely limted choice of ham, cheese and yoghurts. All pastries, croissants etc had gone and were not replenished.

The hotel had a beautiful reception area and we thought we were in for a treat. Well...we were very wrong. Our room was on the top floor....#112. The only good thing was that we were close to the door to the rooftop terrace (which was quite nice). Our room was absolutely tiny...there was hardly room enough for us to open our suitcases. After sitting in the room for a few minutes, we noticed a loud noice that seemed to turn on and off every few minutes. Apparently, our room was next door to the boiler/pump room. So....every few minutes, you would hear this very loud, whirring type of noise. We were so tired after our awful driving experience through Rome, that we decided to just deal with the room. Come the next morning, the pump noise seemed to just stay on continuously....turns out it must have been the water pump and was now running non-stop due to everyone taking showers. Come to find out....getting up at 8am was apparently too late as there was now no more water. The water would hardly spray out of the sink faucet and then just didn't work at all. When we did get water, it was full of sediment. Breakfast was nothing to write home about. Though we liked the rooftop patio, having our room next to the door up to it was not pleasant. People were constantly stomping by our door and the terrace door was constantly being slammed. We had a horrible experience at Pace Helvezia and would never stay there again. The only good thing about it was that the hotel was close to several of the sights and had a nice rooftop terrace.", "Date": "May 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location\u201d", "Author": "Bernice7", "ReviewID": "UR3450551", "Content": "Have just returned from a short break in this wonderful city, so much to see, so a return visit is definitely on the cards.

Showers had to be quick, whilst trying to unblock the waste using big toe to lift the grid cover, because the shower tray would fill up and threaten to flood the bathroom floor. Breakfast very continental. No toast. Just pastries, sugary cereal, bread, meats and cheeses.

Having said all this we took quite a liking both to our room and the hotel. The high rating is because the position is superb. Right slap bang in the middle of all the main tourist sights. No need to use public transport. Everywhere, including the Vatican (30 mins), is within walking distance. It is almost on Piazza Venezia. 5 min walk to Trevi fountain. 15 mins to Spanish Steps.

Just like a bedroom and hence all we wanted to do was sleep there not live in it. We stayed in Room 96 on the 5th floor, we had a balcony with a fantastic view, and yes the location was fantastic too, Last year I stayed near the Vatican but this has to be the best location, for getting to everything, a 5 minute stroll to the Trevi Fountain.

Just buy a bottle of wine and spend night on the roof. You can see Colosseum, Vatican and all the major attractions (roofs of course). All attractions are really walking distance from the hotel. So it was quite convenient to go in and out many times a day. For people who expect luxury from 4* in Rome - don't go there. Our room was quite small and furniture was quite basic. If that bothers you choose something else. *s in Rome are assigned first and most by location rather than luxury. And Pace Helvezia delivers perfect location, perfect views, good servise and adequate rooms. That's why I gave it top rating here. I prefer to see Rome from my window, rather than expensive furniture, and I could see half of the Rome from my windows on 4th floor. Room 94, if I remember well.

This hotel should be rated Two Star, at best. I stayed in Room #9. The decor is in serious need of updating and renovation. Our double bed was rock solid and I could feel the springs beneath me. We were so uncomfortable. The bathroom was dirty and there was mildew in the shower and all around the sink. The faucets were crusty with a film of unknown origin ( a combination of age and dirt I suppose). The breakfast service was less than desirable and the coffee was terrible in comparsion to the beautifully steamed and freshly pressed coffee I had in our hotels in both Venice and Florence. The lighting was so dim, it made the room even gloomier. We just returned from our trip, having stayed here July 31st through August 3rd ( some of the hottest days in Rome). With that said, I have to say that the air conditioning was so useless that I cooled myself off better by standing still and sweating. I stood on a chair twice to make sure it was even working, it was that terrible! To top it off, in the unbearable heat they chose not to air condition the common areas of the hotel. We walked off the street sweating and would sweat some more just getting to our room. That was ridiculous. I chose the hotel because of its fabulous location (minutes walk to Trevi Fountain, Piazza Venezia and the Tragar Market) and 4 star rating. I paid a great deal of money for my brief stay and was so very dissappointed that I had spent so much for a low quality hotel. Do not stay here unless they close down and do a great deal of upgrading and refurbishing! You could better spend your money anywhere else.

It is a shame that the Leonardi Group does not take advantage of this to develop the hotel's full potential. The hotel was certainly 4-star - at least back in 1968. It fails, however to match any 4-star criteria by modern standards. The hotel is run on a shoe-string budget, to the extent that the friendly staff were put in the embarrassing position of explaining that there were no personnel available to serve drinks / provide much-needed refreshments outside breakfast hours. They dealt promptly with our leaking sink however and conjured up an extra chair from the \"unused\" bar to provide some seating in our room, to make up for the barrack-room beds and cramped accommodation. The breakfast fare was of very limited choice and monotonous. The view from the roof terrace was spectacular, although a total absence of any shelter (parasols / sunshades) restricted daytime viewing to 20 minutes at most to avoid the risk of excessive exposure to the sun. At night no illumination was provided and we fear that it is only a matter of time before an accident occurs. The staff were as conscientious and professional as their meagre resources allowed. Running a \"pension\" with a 4-star label was clearly a matter of embarrassment for them. One final point: not all guests are of Roman Catholic persuasion. Our room was adorned by a depiction of the Virgin Mary along with a gruesome picture of a heart surrounded by thorns which we found aesthetically grotesque. Some non-Catholics would find this grossly offensive. The Leonardi Group should clarify its objectives: either turn this hotel into a truly world-class operation worthy of its location or be honest and demote it by at least two stars to reflect its current reality.", "Date": "July 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wakefield, RI", "Title": "\u201cWhat a view from the rooftop terrace!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2304666", "Content": "The best things about this hotel are the rooftop terrace and the location.
