The hotel is situated between the two Gaudi houses that our a must on anyones list, very close to metro ,and across the street from the city double decker tour. Also, walking distance to the Rambla. The price was 210e per night for a room with two beds. Room was large and airy and light Staff was wonderful. One night they recommended the restaurant across the street (part of the hotel). When my friend and i went in (without reservations) they were reluctant to seat us, but did. We waited fine minutes and no wait staff came, so we left. Upon reporting it to the front desk, the manager sent us a bottle of wine, with a note of apology..

Generally no big complaints. Check in was a bit slow, and also you had to wait quite a while if you wanted to ask anything at reception. I stayed in the older part of the hotel - the hotel is split in two and the other part is across the road - not completely ideal. The room itself was nicely decorated, but a little small, for example you couldn't have the wardrobe door open and walk past, so unpacking your case involves a lot of door opening and closing! Didn't matter too much as I was hardly in there. Bathroom was nice enough too. The restaurant was located in the other building, so you have to dress to go outside to go for breakfast. Breakfast was OK, but not great. As was the evening meal I had there on one occassion - a four course affair. The other nights we went out to one of the many restaurants nearby and had a more enjoyable meal. Location of the hotel is pretty good - near to a metro stop and around 10 mins walk to Placa de Catalunya, so not a bad base to use for sight seeing. As for the hotel facilities, the bar was quite small, the lifts were on the slow side and the internet access in the rooms, whilst free, was very slow - almost to the point of being unuseable. It was better in the conference room which is located on the top floor, along with a rooftop bar and terrace, which was nice and gave good views of the street. There was also a pool up there, but you wouldn't exactly say it was designed for swimming in. It was closed when I was there anyway. Hotel did have a gym, in the other building. To be fair, it was better than I expected, but it was small and just about adequate. Overall, not a bad hotel if you are looking for somewhere with just the essential facilities, but quite possibly there are better hotels close by.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashdod, HaDarom, Israel", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "Eliran M", "ReviewID": "UR127711279", "Content": "Great hotel in amazing location 10 minutes walking away from plasa de cataluniya , next to gaui's museum great st. there is metro next to the hotel and also a tourist's bus station which is the most important , great reasurants to be found around buttom line i strongly recomended this one as well the staff were really kind and helpful enjoy it as we did", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ridgefield Park, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Ana Maria A", "ReviewID": "UR127245148", "Content": "The hotel staff was very helpful, rooms very modern with everything that we could think of.

We arrived full of expectations because of the excellent reputation, the excellent location right on the Passeig de Gracia in the Eixample and because of the royal associations of the hotel. Our initial reaction was not good at all. The hotel tunred out to be in two buildings on either side of a cross street of the Passeig de Gracia. We went to the wrong one of course and after checking in were offered no assistance to transfer to the other building. Initially the room was 322, surpisingly large for the location but very damaged........the sheers had tears in them, the painting was missing from the wall with the hooks left exposed, the wall mounted TV had been replaced with a deck mounted model and the holes in the wall and brackets just left there, the bathroom had cracked floor tiles and dirty brown stains in the ceiling over the shower. Worst of all it appeared that someone had opened a bottle of cava or something similar and sprayed the wall behind the bed, there were stains running down the wall that the cleaning staff had not noticed and cleaned up. Either someone had recently trashed this room or the maintenance of the hotel is really not up to scratch. I do have photos of all of these points. The morning after check in we complained about the condition of the room and without question were offered an alternative - room 422 - which was generally in much better condition and we were quite happy in this room. Although we were offered an alternative without any fuss both the receptionist and the person who showed us the alternative feined total surprise that we could be unhappy with anything to do with the room despite its very obvious problems. Which raises another point, in contrast to several other hotels where we have stayed in close proximity to this the reception and door staff (on the odd occasion that there was door staff!) were very aloof and superior. Only the bar staff were friendly. So it turns out that the \"classic\" (read boring late 90s design, not traditional like the style of the exterior of the building nor designerly like many Barcelona hotels) rooms are on one side of the street and the newer modern rooms are on the other side of the street and 21 Euros a night extra. And whilst both buildings have interesting modernist exteriors very little of anything remains in the interiors apart from the entrance hall and stairway in one of the buildings. So overall after the initial change of rooms the room was realtively large, boring in design but adequately comfortable. It would surprise me if these \"classic\" rooms are not completely made over before long becuase they just don't compete with so many of the hotel rooms in the vicinity or even the ones in the same hotel across the road. The public areas of the hotel and the exterior of both buildings are interesting and really quite lovely.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malmo, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cQuality hotel\u201d", "Author": "Joahn N", "ReviewID": "UR122462230", "Content": "Our company stayed at this hotel during our incentive trip to Barcelona.

We changed rooms twice. The good points are the location which resembles Madison Avenue with lots of high end stores (a lot of which you will not see in the states) and awesome food choices at multiple places just out the door. It is far enough away from the Ramblas area, which is a bit of a madhouse. The Hotel is in two buildings, formerly mansions of some sort, I think. The place is handsome and clean. The lobby bar is pricey and boring, so I would go elsewhere given so many choices. They have a large, open terrace cocktail area on the 8th floor in the opposite building that gives an awesome view of the Sagrada Familia Cathedral. After you get your first drink, however, they basically forget about you. So expect to get up and find your server. You can't sit at the bar itself which is for servers. So why am I down on this place? Expect any room facing the street (and this is a corner property) to yield lots of street noise. It is on the Passeige de Gracia, which is a major thoroughfare).That basically eliminates half the rooms. The ones facing their inner courtyard are much quieter. Also, you can hear the subway rumble underneath constantly. Being on the higher floors does not eliminate the problem because low frequencies travel. So if you wake up in the middle of the night or are a light sleeper, you may be upset. We had to change rooms twice.

The newer 'Comtes' side has the better bar open late into the night and with wonderful views of the Casa Mila and Segrada Familia. Set on the Paseo de Gracia the location couldn't possibly be better, shops and sights within walking distance or even nearer. We have visited this hotels a few times in the past, though not to stay, and the staff levels seemed to have been cut back somewhat, probably understandably in these times, but at no point was there more than one person on reception, which can be a little annoying. Those staff, and all in fact, were helpful and attentive. The room, with a view of the street was lovely although, maybe another money saving scheme, toiletries were a bit spare, two people showering twice a day need more than one tiny bottle of shower gel. And very surprisingly, for a hotel of this quality, no slippers or bathrobe. Very happy to say Wi-Fi was free, as it should always be. Our bed was marvelously comfy with great thin quilt. Extra pillows are available on request. We have eaten at the Lasarte restaurant on another visit and it is very good, this time we didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on food.

The reception staff were very helpful and friendly, and showed us up to our room. The room itself was fantastic, a huge room in fact with a large dressing area with wardrobes and full length mirrors. The bathroom was nicely done and the shower was amazing.. Spacious and powerful. Bath robes ( albeit very large ones.. and i'm only 5ft1) were provided as were all the toiletries. The bed was incredibly comfortable and very big... the room had full patio windows all across with motorized shutters for privacy.

The location of this hotel is perfect, situated on the Passeig de Gracia, a stones throw away from Gaudi's famous buildings. The roof top bar, Alaire, has great views across the city to the Sagrada Famillia, and their \"patatas Bravas\" is to die for. We spent a week here, we hired a motorbike to get us around the city and to make the journey to the beach easier ( this hotel is roughly 3 miles from the beach). Worth a visit is the Tibidabo Mountain. We rode the bike as far as we could and then took a ride on the Funiculor tram that takes you to the top. The view from up there is incredible, you can see all across Barcelona. And the Church is beautiful. There's a funfair at the top that's over 100 years old! We discovered several restaurants this time in Barcelona and think it's worth mentioning a few of them as the are down side streets and possibly wouldn't be found normally. ( we discovered them whilst riding around on the bike. La Tagliatella on C/Mallorca is a lovely quaint italian, the food was lovely... especially the Pizzas! The staff were very friendly too. If you like Indian food then head to Mayuna, on Calle Girona. The food was possibly the best Indian food I have ever eaten and the setting is beautiful.

However, the first day we used it was lunchtime, completely empty but they wouldn't let us sit on the comfy sofas, but perch on little bar stools! Ridiculous!

I was not disapointed by this hotel. The rooms were great. Lovely modern interior with fantastic bathroom which was very spacious and modern. My room had a lovely balcony that I thoroughly enjoyed spending time on each morning. The roof terrace is wonderful. I can not say enough good things about it - the view is breath taking, drinks were fantastic and we even had an oyster specialist spend time with us talking about eating oysters. Beware the drinks are quite expensive but the view makes it very worth spending the little bit extra. If you want to offset these expensive drinks there's a great little tapas bar next door that serves the biggest liquer measures I've ever seen for very cheap prices. I was however dissapointed by the maintenance being under taken on the pool which meant it could not be used. The pool facilities were the main thing that lead me to stay in this hotel so it was really frustrating that maintenance was going on. The key thing was that I was not notified prior to my stay that these refurbishments were taking place. If I had been I may not have chosen to stay in this hotel. That said I would then have missed out on the fantastic roof terrace. If you want a pool and are due to stay I'd suggest a quick call to the hotel.

The bed is ok, the pillows were nice feather, and the mattress was ok.

The workout room was so filthy and disgusting that I expect a breakout of flesh eating bacteria at any moment; it reaked of fungus and sweat. It had no cleaning products available (standard in most hotel gyms) so it is impossible to sanitize the equipment after using it or before. Gym is in sister property next door by the way. The floor of the sauna room, where I placed a towel down to avoid walking barefoot, was so dingy, that when I moved the towel afterwards, it was black with scum.

O.K. - so we had booked through an agency, and had a basic room, but in a 4* hotel. We looked out onto a brick wall! It seemed to be clean and well appointed. We were aware that there were two restaurants - but to get to breakfast one had to cross a busy, four lane road, to the other section of the hotel - not too difficult on a warm, sunny morning, but I would not want to stay here in winter. The breakfast was fine - but I have had better. In the evening, the breakfast room becomes the restaurant, and the food was excellent, clearly influenced by the other restaurant (on the other side of the road, which holds a Michelan Star.) I am a foodie, and had intended to eat - at some price! - in that restaurant, but the basic restaurant was of such a standard that I could not justify the extra expense. So, what was wrong with the hotel? On the surface, it is well appointed and clean, but, behind the facade, this is an old building and all is not well. The hotwater system regularly deposits rust from old pipes in your bath! However, my main reservation about this hotel relates to the staff. For an hotel of 4*standard in the centre of the second largest city in Spain, I would have expected a better understanding of the English language from the staff - especially at the Reception level. Having reported that the room had been serviced, but no towels provided, it took over 4 hours and three telephone calls to deal with the matter. The following morning, the Management dealt with the matter in an appropriate manner - we were upgraded to a better room, but the staff member sent to assist us to move was, to put it bluntly, surly and rude. He provided no help what so ever. He was not alone in presenting an unfriendly response to enquiries, largely from lack of language skills. Many aspects of this hotel are fine, but being divided into two parts across a busy road is not helpful.

Our room was in the older tower and we were lucky to have been given a corner room which definitely gave us a bit more room. It was overlooking the main road and yet i slept like a baby every night and the double sinked bathroom was beaut. Our room rate included breakfast which was good, infact we rarely ate lunch whilst we were there but if it hadn't been included we would have had no problem finding some place nearby. Although perhaps not suitable for breakfast the TORRES wine bar directly across the street we loved as very chilled out with great tapas and lovely wine. We had some fabulous meals and cocktails whilst we were there, El NOTI which was only a 10 min walk was particularly special as it was quite funky and the set menu was great value. We also asked at reception for a recommendation one evening when we were going to the Montjuic area and the place they sent us to was fab. It was called MONTJUIC EL XALET and had the most amazing view of any city i've ever seen. It is literally at the top of the montjuic funicular railway and we casually strolled up without a reservation and somehow managed to get an amazing table for 2 on the open air terrace...definitley worth booking and get there before sunset.

The Exemplar itself is a wonderful area to explore and has some of the best examples of Gaudi architecture a block from the front door of the hotel. We had rooms in the \"original\" building. (Apparently the hotel expanded at some time by purchasing a property across the street.) The hotel is clean, and quiet. The decor of the hotel in understated elegant. (If you prefer the decor of a Ritz Carlton, this hotel is not it.) The rooms we had were nice sized facing an interior couryard. What the room lacked in a view was more than made up for in a quiet stay--no exterior city noise to speak of. The rooms were nicely appointed--stone floors and counter-tops in the bathroom, wood floors in main area, heavy draiperies, high ceilings, comfortable linens and bedding, LCD TV. Great HAVC-quiet and efficient. The service at the front desk was veyr helpful for dinner reservations and other recommendations and they are licensed to exchange currency as well. The only negatives-- the two PCs used for web access are not free. The rooftop pool is small--but hey, we were not in Barcleona to sit around and swim laps. The mixed drinks at the rooftop bar are quite expensive at 12 EU. My recommendation is to enjoy the free salty snacks, order something soft and enjoy the view as the sun sets because it's absolutely spectacular. For most of us this hotel would be considered a gem.

We went into the the buidling that has a very old and glamerous lobby, and were told we would be staying in the buidling opposite. The building across the road has a really modern lobby, but the receptionist told us the rooms were the same. The room we were allocated was beautiful; lovely wooden floors, a georgeous bathroom and comfy beds. My sister and I are both non-smokers so had to ask for a non-smoking room. There are floors of rooms for smokers and floors for non-smokers. We didn't eat at the hotel as it was very expensive, however we saved 20 Euro each and had breakfast on the last day...well worth it. Getting to the hotel: We didn't do our homework and got a cab from the airport which cost a whopping 40 Euro. We then found out about the bus; this cost just 4 euro 75 cents each, took 23 minutes and dropped us of off outside the departure doors of the airport. Eating out: We got ripped off in a restaurant on La Ramblas on our first night. Next evening we discoverd a restaurant called Qu Qu on the paseo de Gracia.

The hotel is actually composed of two buildings each at one side of the street. We booked the hotel over easytobook.com and were first given a room in the part of the hotel in which the rooms have not been renovated. The room was OK, but I really disliked the bathroom, as it was visibly old, especially the bath-tub and the shower was fixed high on the wall and could not be removed and that is something I really hate. Furthermore, this room was overlooking the street. It had a wonderfull view onto La Pedrera, but it was however too noisy, especially in early morning because of traffic. So we decided to change the room after the 1st night and we were given a room in another part of the hotel and that one was completely renovated, everything was brand new, bathroom was aslo brend new, there was a tub with a normal shower. The new room was overlooking the garden, which was also a very nice view and it was soooo quiet. The hotel location is perfect - it is between two beatiful and famous Gauid's buidlings -La Pedrera and La Casa Batlo, both in the closest vicinity. The hotel is actually situated in a modern administration street, lined up with shops of famous brends. La Rambla and other sightseeings are at the walking distance. We used metro for some locations, there is a metro-station very close to the hotel and sometimes we used a taxi, which is not expensive. The lobby of the building with the renovated rooms has a charm of an antique building. You can see the stairs at my photos. There is a tiny swimming-pool at the roof, as well as a sun-bathing deck, which is also small and there are not to many chairs. But it is so convenient to refresh in the swimming-poll after sightseeing and then continue the tour of the city, as everything is so close. In the building with not-renovated rooms, there is a very nice roof bar. The staff is helpful, but could use some more kindness and helpfullness, but it is a problem all over the city.

Of what we saw, most rooms aren't as spacious or as full of character as ours (no. 450), which was triangular and facing the cross-road. The triple glazed window made it very quiet. Unlike others here, we didn't find the location ideal. Maybe it is for businessmen, not for siteseeing. It is about 15 minute walk from P. Catalunia, the northern point of the actual centre. It may not seem like much, but in a place like Barcelona, where you constantly walk, we preferred saving our strength and using the metro. The metro station is located a few minutes down the road. That distance made us skip stopping at the the hotel in the middle of the day, though we were right at the nearest station changing lines. It is a hotel that makes you feel comfortable. We loved the attention for details: Quality soaps, thick towels, good matrress, nice sheets, messages sent over to your room. Also, the safe and minibar are a big plus. The staff was nice and helpful. It all makes you feel well taken-care of. The Hotel isn't as generous with his public facillities. There's a lovely roof-terasse, but having the hotel bar there makes it unpleasant to enjoy the view without spending.

While the location was excellent and the hotel was clean, we had some big problems that made it very uncomfortable. First, while I had been very clear in my email correspondence about needing one double and one triple room (for our three kids, ages 15, 14 and 12), we arrived and they did not have our rooms. They wanted to put an extra bed in a double room that only had one bed, but we insisted that we had been very clear in our reservation that we needed three beds. (In fact, in email correspondence, I was given the option of a having a triple room or having my two boys share a bed in a double room and I opted for the triple.) Finally, they squeezed an extra bed into a very small double room that had two beds. From my email correspondence, it was clear that this was not the type of room that they had intended to give us. That would have been OK, but it turned out that the extra bed was INCREDIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE. You could feel the springs everywhere. Plus, it was rather small, when my 15 year old try to switch beds with my 12 year old, so that my 12 year old could get some sleep, he could not fit. My 12 year old did not sleep much while we were at Condes (and you might imagine how much fun it was to be with him during the day). Some of the nights he slept in the crack between the two twin beds (which made me wonder how they could have even suggested that two kids share a bed in a double room), some of the nights he slept in my bed, and some nights, he tossed and turned on the cot. In addition, when we arranged to leave and tried to book a cab to the airport, the concierge told us to wait until later in the day. We needed a larger cab for 5 people (the standard ones only hold 4). We didn't insist that he just go ahead and book the cab (after all, what did we know... he was the concierge). As a result, we almost didn't get a cab as the p.m. concierge had trouble making the reservation. To boot, the fare was completely different from what the concierge had told us.... and I don't mean that it was lower than what we expected. In sum, the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing at the Condes. If everything goes smoothly, you may have a very nice stay. But the possibility of human error is much greater at Condes than at a better hotel. The concierge's excuse after each SNAFU was either that the reservations department didn't know what they were doing or that the other concierge could have been in training and, therefore, didn't know what he was doing. (By the way, the foot of my very \"hip\" bed had a piece of wood that almost caused me to break my neck on more than one occasion.) The Majestic Hotel is just down the block. I didn't stay there because they had booked all of their cots for our dates. It might be worth looking at. I considered the Hotel Arts, but decided that, since it was December, I didn't want to be that far away from the center of things. Amazingly, the prices there did not seem to be through the roof. I also considered the Hotel Colon, which is a good location (just across from the Cathedral), but had read that the rooms were a little tired.

We have been to Barcelona twice before and stayed near the FC Barcelona football ground (Hilton) and by the marina (Eurostars Gran) and we wanted to try a central location. We had checked out places previously close to the Passeig De Gracia and whilst I would have liked to stay at the Casa Fuster (too expensive) or the Majestic (a little too expensive and very variable room standards) we settled on the Condes (great location and 130 euros per night for all 3 of us and free breakfast for our daughter if we paid for ours at 16 euros). I had read the reviews on here and looked at the various photos on this site and felt that the rooms in the 'older' building would suit us better. We booked directly with the hotel and requested a room in the 'older' building which they noted. Upon arrival we were greeted in a polite but not over friendly manner by the reception staff. We were offered a choice of rooms and we were guided to them by a friendly porter to make our decision and not surprisingly we chose the largest of the 2 rooms given our daughter was sharing. I would say that the room size was above average with a very comfortable bed, large flat screen tv, a couple of armchairs, mini bar, safe and adequate storage. A fairly typical layout for hotel rooms I guess. Our room had a small balcony that looked over towards the Majestic hotel opposite and the triple glazing worked well in keeping noise levels down from the streets outside. It is fair to say however, that the rooms are in need of refurbishment and the bedding and towels have seen better days. The bathroom was nicely done out in marble but let down by mildew and mould stains, missing grouting and flaking paint. What is the point of Bulgari toiletries if there is mould on the ceiling and around the bath? The building itself is externally very attractive, in a superb location (one of the best in the city in my opinion) with wonderful views from the roof terrace which in the Summer should be a treat with a small plunge pool and bar area. We didn't use the bar in the hotel as it lacked atmosphere and given the location atmosphere is available aplenty elsewhere. Breakfast was across the road as others have described and decent enough (not as good as the Eurostars which was outstanding but better than the Hilton). Again there are plenty of alternatives given the location so try it once and go elsewhere if you are not satisfied. The staff were polite, and answered every query but did not go beyond this i.e no real interaction with guests and no one asked if we enjoyed our stay when we checked out. In summary the location is fantastic with every form of transport you are likely to need on your doorstep along with a superb selection of shops, bars and restaurants. The rate we paid was very reasonable for this location in Barcelona and we would struggle to find anything at that price on the Passeig De Gracia or close to it (I know I did try) . The refurbished new wing externally looks like the other building across the road but the management decided to give the rooms the minimalist treatment (the current vogue) and in my opinion missed the point of the asset they have which is a fantastic character property that demanded more characterful rooms to match. The rooms that have yet to have this treatment (i.e the building we were in) demonstrate that the refurb was clearly required and overdue but they should resist the temptation to take the minimalist route this time and keep the more traditional feel but with some new fittings, fresh grouting, a coat of paint and some new towels and bedding. Now if they could arrange a management training week to get the customer service up a notch or two and you have a first class hotel and that 130 euros rate becomes 200 euros and I cannot afford to stay! I do not want this review to sound too negative as we very much enjoyed our stay and I have to say many of the criticisms are in my experience common to many hotels worldwide not least the UK where I live. I have yet to stay in a hotel that has got everything right (subjective anyway) but I have stayed in many that think they have. I would challenge the management at the Condes to get their act together though and turn an ok hotel into a really good one with the best location in town.", "Date": "January 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham England", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the money\u201d", "Author": "likesnicethiings", "ReviewID": "UR12404410", "Content": "Stayed here between Christmas and New Year.

The bathroom is really cool but the design of the shower is stupid. Water just flows out onto the bathroom floor and beyond. The location is great although you are in the middle of the shopping/tourist areas but if you want to stroll down and visit a couple of Gaudi's famous works, they are right there.

It was used after we checked in before we went out, so we just ignored it and tried not to walk in the bathroom after, but when we used it again in the morning and the floor looked even worse after, we just said sod it and went out to party, however I found it very strange that the cleaners didn't pick up on this as we came back to a fully made room with fresh towels, but soaking wet pond like bathroom!

When the three of us arrived--my husband and I were traveling with our teenage daugther--the bellman began taking us across the street, based on the instructions of the woman working at reception who did not even speak to us. Upon seeing what was basically a closet for three people, we insisted on seeing what was available in the older building. We were taken to a lovely room that was not huge but certainly spacious enough for the three of us, with a classy marble bathroom that had plenty of room and two showers. We were told that they had been trying to do us a favor by cramming us into the afore mentioned closet as they would be working on the elevator in the old building during our stay and did not want to inconvenience us. We took the larger room and what do you know? There was nothing at all wrong with the elevator and they for some reason had made up a ridiculous story to attempt to stick us in the inferior accomodation. Perhaps it is because we had booked early and had a great rate...Who knows. But it was the height of rudeness and disrespect. The staff remained consistently aloof and though they did in fact speak some English, they certainly did not go out of their way to be helpful at any time. We are very independent when we travel and do most of our sightseeing on our own or through tours that we book privately....so their indifference didn't matter to us, but if you are coming here and thinking the concierge will be of assistance, you will be disappointed. Otherwise, the hotel is clean and comfortable with a great breakfast and reasonable rates for Barcelona. The location may be a plus or a minus depending on how you look at it. It is situated on what you might call Barcelona's upper east side...about a ten minute walk from Las Ramblas and the old city. We loved the location as it was close enough the the craziness, but far enough away to escape the carnival atmosphere if you wanted to. Great restaurants within walking distance and a half a block from Casa Battlo, the amazing home designed by Gaudi for a private client. So many travel agents put clients at the waterfront. It is a long hike into the center of town from there and unless you are planning to actually sit on the beach, it's really out in left field. Certainly worth a visit for lunch and a stroll. Our favorite restaurant was Casa Calvet, another Gaudi building turned into a restaurant. Exquisite surroundings and food to match. Even our 18 year old swooned.

Consequently, when we shut the hallway door, we could leave the doors to our individual rooms open and we had, in effect, a suite. The rooms, although small, were spotlessly clean. Our windows overlooked the main street but we heard no noise. The bathrooms were large and immaculate. The front desk was easy to deal with. Location is excellent.

We initially thought it was a large jacuzzi until we confirmed otherwise. However given the fact that most hotels in this part of town are in 19th century buildings any pool at all was a plus even if small.If you are with someone who loves shopping the hotel sits on one of the high end shopping streets in Barcelona and is 2 blocks from one of Gaudi's architectual masterpieces as well as being close to the metro.

We were not disappointed. The location is fantastic. almost exactly ten minutes from the ramblas, so it's near enough to walk, but not close enough so that it's dangerous. There was a great buzz in this area, without it being too loud or crowded. Approx. three minutes walk from two different gaudi buildings, a pile of restaurants, and lots of designer shops (we're a family of four women and one unfortunate father, so this went down well.) The Hotel is in two parts - the old and the new - but you wouldn't really know the difference, they're both bright, airy and modern. Our rooms were in the old building. They were spacious, and not too loud even though they were right by the street. Air conditioning was great. Beds were SO comfortable, The pillows were also great (I know that sounds a tad odd, but they were). Bathrooms were also lovely, spacious too. Plenty of hot water and towels, shampoo, conditioner...etc. Plenty of space for clothes and even a little safe for your valuables. We had two rooms - one with a double bed, one with two singles, and each had a little balcony. The staff were wonderful. When we arrived at the hotel, we went into the new building (which has a green staircase), but were told that our rooms were in the \"old\" building, because of the noise levels caused by renovations. This threw us slightly at first, but the \"old\" building was about ten seconds away, and and far from old. (this one has a stone staircase) There's lots of space to sit down and relax in the lobby, and even a baby grand piano which - much to our delight - we were allowed play during the day. Brekfast in the morning (in the \"new\" building) was lovely. A nice buffet table, so you could pick and choose whatever you wanted from rashers to fresh fruit. The terrace in the \"old\" building is just lovely. It has bar service, and you can see the city at night - but also into the rooms across the street. I'd watch out for that if you're ever staying in the \"new\" building. Price wise, we thought it was expensive - But well worth it, because staying there was a real treat. So what's wrong with it? The swimming pool, which we nicknamed \"the sitting puddle.\" It's tiny. 9 X 13 feet. The solarium was 20 X 30 feet. This really made no difference to us, because we spent most of our time sight seeing, but if you want an actual pool, this place doesn't have it - at least, not in the \"old\" building. Just one last thing, it's as cheap to get a taxi from the city airport to town as any other way - \u20ac23 for four of us.

We had booked this hotel because of it's great location and because it had free internet access in-room and a small outdoor pool. We checked in and were met with a flustered front desk person, followed by a gesture that we were in the 'other' building across the street (the one with no pool). We clarified that we could still use the pool, so that was OK. Next, we needed the password for the internet access. That's when we discovered that you actually only get 1 hour per day of access in the lobby. If you want internet in your room, they charge an outrageous amount per 24 hour period. We went to talk to the front desk - waited a full half hour, got what we thought was a Manager, who 'checked our story' on the website while we waited - only to see for herself that there is no mention of internet service surcharges. She had to ask her Manager and would call us in 10 minutes. An hour later, we went to find her Manager - got a 'Front Desk Manager' who argued the fine points and the fact that not all hotels say they surcharge for internet access, but many actually do charge. He wouldn't give in, so we asked to speak to the Manager (so many managers and yet such poor service). He couldn't accommodate us, but said we should ask him at the end of the day what their decision was. Ultimately, the 'best offer' was half price for internet access, which we took because we needed it. So, long story short - a great location, OK room and terrible service that actually seems to forget that service is what they are supposed to provide. End of story.

There were absolutely NO surprises - this site really works! If there are enough responses, you can get a good feel for what a hotel is really like (can see through the mindless positives, the whiner negatives, and identify those who are giving you the straight stuff). So, ... our feedback regarding the Condes de Barcelona is that it is a tremendous value, smack dab in the hottest section of the Eixample. The hotel is fairly luxurious - not the Ritz, but all of the linens, wall coverings, and floorings were in \"new\" condition. The service was very good; not the highly anticipatory graciousness of the top flite hotels, but very attentive and responsive. The rooms are relatively large for Barcelona, and exceptionally clean (very important to us) and modern in appearance. Based upon some of the reviews we'd read here, we requested a room in the main building - not the newly acquired annex across the street - and one with a balcony, preferably away from the street (the very busy Passeig de Gracia). They complied, and we were most satisfied. The hotel is situated between two of Antonin Gaudi's better known works in town: La Pedrera and Casa Batllo. As well, much of the high end shopping in Barcelona is within blocks of the hotel. And the exceptional Barcelona Metro System has two stops within two blocks of the Condes de Barcelona. The entrance is a nice marble trimmed affair; but the kicker is the winding staircase rising from the main lobby. This marble staircase is trimmed in Gaudi ironwork. And the public areas AND rooms are trimmed in very rich hardwoods, which complement the marble and ironwork very nicely. The architectural detail was a very nice surprise. The main hotel building has a nice rooftop terrace overlooking the Passeig de Gracia and La Pedrera, a nice place to unwind of an evening. Breakfast is served in the annex, and is a decent layout - albeit too pricey for our taste, particularly with several very fine pasteria's within a block. The price was the kicker. We would have expected to pay about 50 to 100 euros more for a hotel with the appointments, service, and location of the Condes de Barcelona. I've stayed in Barcelona four times now, and this was easily my favorite hotel to-date.
