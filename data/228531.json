We were greeted by name as we checked in about noon in late October. We were upgraded to a superior room with a balcony overlooking the avenue. The weather was beautiful as we sat on the balcony sipping a glass of wine. There is a market across the street that has everything you need for your stay. The local wines are a treat and they have fresh fruit , wines and cheeses. The breakfast was very good although the gentleman serving the buffet looked overwhelmed. The coffee was in a precarious position, on a shelf over the food preperation. I would find a seperate station for the coffee and cream as people could not get to it as others were serving themself from the buffet. Otherwise, the room was so clean and quiet. The housekeeping staff and I had fun trying to understand each other as I asked for more wash clothes. They were always very helpful. The Condado is a find in Barcelona. We were not very far from the large department store, Ingles which has a great market also. The hotel is in a residential area with homes and embassys. The people are friendly and helpful.

Bus 58 stops just around the corner of the hotel and takes you to Placa Catalanya where the main shopping streets are! - Weaknesses: Glas door into the bathroom... I just generally don\u2019t like to pee or poop when others can see and hear me! And the sink was in the bedroom, and not in the bathroom! Other than that, the bathroom was nice. You might not hear the noise from the street, but you could hear people talking in the hallway. Bad sound isolation from the hallway into the bedroom. Me and my friend were actually woken up by people walking through the hallway talking one morning. The metro station is 15 minutes walk from the hotel...

Location- a good area, felt quite safe. A supermarket across the road was handy and plenty of cafes etc for breakfast. Also some restuarants round the corner, we ate there first night and was nice, all local residents there, not tourists. The hotel is about 10mins walk to Ramblas La Catalunya, which itself becomes La Ramblas further down. La Catalunya has a lot of lovely places to eat outside with better value and food than further down on La Ramblas. The metro is about 10mins walk, cheap and easy to use, I would recommend it to get about. We did the hop on/off tour bus which was fine but should have used the metro more.

The rooms are fairly spacious and nicely decorated in a modern style with lots of hanging space in the wardrobe. The bathroom is also modern style and is big with it's own separate toilet cubicle and a very large shower cubicle. The hotel provide free bottles of water in mini fridges on the landing on each floor. Our room faced a small club on the other side of the road and we were a bit sceptical this might be noisy but the windows were quadruple glazed and we were not disturbed at all - we slept very well and typically in Spain the youngsters know how to behave and there is no drunken disorderly behaviour here. In fact it was really nice on the Saturday when we were on our way back from our sightseeing in the city to see all the under 18's queuing to get into an \"afternoon\" disco - there was so much excitement from them, it was a real event and the staff at the hotel explained that they just go to dance, there is no alcohol allowed. I want to mention the club to be honest in my review but I can also honestly say it is not a problem at all and I am really fussy! There is so much to see in Barcelona, it really has everything, the port, the beach, the old town, brilliant shopping, Gaudi, Picasso, wonderful food and the best atmosphere. You can walk around Barcelona and even travel on the metro late into the night and feel perfectly safe - lots of people about. The advice (sensibly) is to keep a close eye on your belongings when out and about as there will always be opportunist pickpockets in crowded areas but you just need to be aware and sensible.

We had a hard time trying to use our key to open our room door. The man from the front desk went out of his way to help us out without hesitating. They also helped us with directions and calling a cab for us whenever we needed one. Don't worry if you think your Spanish isn't that great. They speak English really well. Our room was small, but comfortable. We had a room with a view of the heating unit in the center of the building. But this didn't bother us since we spent most of our time exploring Barcelona. The room was very clean and modern. The only small complaint that I had was the WiFi and the location. The WiFi signal was very weak from the floor that we stayed on. So, I had to frequent the computers in the hotel lobby. The location is great if you are in Barcelona for business since this is located in a Business and Fashion district. If you are not, it is a little inconvenient to move around the city. During our stay the FRG stop close to Condado was under construction so the next closest line was the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia station which was about a 15-20 minute walk.

We got a taxi from the airport as we were unsure as to which bus to get to the centre. It cost us 35 euros to the Condado which i thought was quite expensive (everything is in Barcelona!) but i asked the hotel reception about the cost of the taxi & they confirmed this was indeed about the right price. If you don't want to pay the price of a taxi there is a airport shuttle bus that leaves something like every 15 minutes which makes several stops on it's way to the Place de Catalunya (this is the bus we found out about when we were flying back home & it cost 6 euros each & took about 35 minutes). The hotel is decent quality with a very nice lobby area & reception. The staff are mostly very helpful & friendly. There is indeed a constant supply of free bottled water which is a nice touch & very welcome. There is internet available. I was on the trip with my grandma & we both had twin rooms on the 4th floor. I think the room nos were 411 & 417. My room 411 had a nicer shower area than my grandmas room because i had a window in there whereas my grandmas didn't which was a pity as it made it look pokey. Along with this, the shower in my grandmas room was actually stuck right in the corner & actually not very inviting (i did offer to swap rooms with my grandma but we decided to stay put). Both rooms had a window but with no view unfortunately. My room was reasonably bright & airy with the window open but my grandmas was quite dark even with the curtain drawn. If i thought there were other rooms available i may have asked reception for a change of room for my grandma as i was quite dissapointed with it but i already kenw the hotel was fully booked. However we spent most of our time out of the rooms exploring the city & would return to my room in the evening for a drink before retiring. When in Barcelona it is a must to use the city tour bus (there are 2 to choose from but they are basically the same i believe). There is a stop not far from the Condado Hotel. TIP Before you pay to get on the tour bus please make a note to first acquire a discount coupon! We did not know about the discount until we saw other people using them when getting on the bus. Thankfully a lady gave us on of her groups discount tickets & this saved us 6 euros off the cost of the tour bus! When i asked her where did she get the discount coupons from she said her hotel. The Condado does not have these coupons available & if you buy the tour bus tickets from reception you will pay the full price so you should go find them before using the tour bus & save yourselves 6 euros each (possibly available at the tourist information office?). As other people have said the hotel is a little too far out of the centre but i guess this is the price you pay for the cheaper option accommodation. Next time i return to Barcelona (for the 6th time) i would spend the extra just to be nearer to the centre of things as it can be quite a long tiring walk back to the Condado in the evening. There are a few restaurants, cafes & shops around the hotel but still not a great amount of choice & we did not find a restaurant nearby we fancied. We did find a nice little local bar on the next street along from the Condado with seating outside & i would recommed you go there for an evening drink as they are very friendly & the service is good. Apart from this we did use a local cafe for morning coffee & the nearby Starbucks. There is a good supermarket nearby which you can enter from either the hotel side or the local bar side. TIP Everything seems expensive in Barcelona however we did find one bargain. It is the wine in the supermarket. You can buy a 1 litre box of wine for just 99 cents. Less than 1 euro for a 1 litre carton of wine! Red or white. It is very nice too. So i recommend this as for one small glass of wine or beer in the nearby bar costs around 3 euros. Overall we were satisfied with the Condado on this occasion but would spend the extra & stay nearer to the action next time. Final thoughts:- Slept well in my comfy bed. Liked the shower (in my room not in my grandmas). Nice wardrobes with automatic lighting. Good quality Grundig LCD TVs. Door keys are very difficult to get used to. No fridge in room. No clocks in room. Good 3 star but prefer 4 star next time for the extras.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cclean quiet hotel in good location\u201d", "Author": "RachelBurstow", "ReviewID": "UR104241085", "Content": "I stayed here with my husband and two children aged 9 and 14.We had a family suite consisting of two rooms which connected via a small lobby which you could lock so that people could not enter from the corridor.

The hotel was in a fairly good location for most things - Barcelona is so vast you would never be perfectly situated for everything and taxis are cheap so we used them a lot.

I can see that they would be a bit miffed about their white pillowcases being soiled but I wish they had at least told me rather than just express their disapproval in this way.

Barcelona is a beautiful and quaint city. When we arrived at the hotel, it took just a few minutes to check in. We were on the 7th floor and was in our room in minutes. As we entered the room, I thought it was small but quite modern. Then I looked further out the window and saw they had given us a room with a beautiful balcony ove looking the sites of the Gracia area of Barcelona. We had a table and two chairs on the balcony and spent each evening relaxing with a glass of wine! Thank you Condado! The room was immaculate and the bathroom was set up with three private areas, One, a large shower which had great water pressure. There was also a private toilet area and an area with a large sink and mirror. The room was quiet and outside there was a fridge with bottled water for free. Downstairs there was an area with free wifi and a breakfast area. Across the street there was a market with everything you would need from food to wine to toiletries. We went there daily to get fresh bread and meats for our breakfast. The area has many restaurants and shops. Around the corner there is a Starbucks if you want fresh coffee. Buy a T10 metro ticket. I see people complaining about the metro. Well the front desk told us what bus to take where and we just used the bus. There is a stop across the street. Take bus no. 64 to get down to the Las Ramblas area or the waterfront or just to see the city. After a day or two you get the idea of where things are...it is not a difficult city to get around in. Take a day and go to Montserrat. Take the train from the Placa Epana - you can get a ticket that includes the train, rack train and lunch for 36 euros. This is a must see.

Cleanliness: The hotel was spotless from the lobby to the bed-room and bath room. Cleaned daily. Location: The hotel is located in a nice area just off Avenuda Diagonal. If I could fault the hotel's location, it would be that the nearest metro is a 15 minute walk away. However, there are many buses which can take you along Diagonal towards the metro. If you are fit and enjoy walking, you can walk to many of the famous attractions from the hotel within a 40 minutes radius. Barcelona is beautiful seen on foot. Rooms: We opted for the triple as there were three of us and these were hard to come-by in Barcelona, until we stumbled across the Condado Hotel. We had two single beds and a rollaway bed. The room was standard sized and had two basins located in the bedroom as opposed to the bathroom. There was enough wardrobe and surface space. Service: Our room was cleaned daily and to a high standard. We never had to wait long at reception and upon check-out our luggage was stored for us and labelled for safe return later on in the day. Value: It was the cheapest hotel offering a triple room and was good value for money. Sleep quality: We were shattered most days so fell asleep as soon as our heads hit our pillows. You can hear people in the next room when they talk loudly, but the noise level was standard and acceptable for a hotel. General comments/tips: The Mercadona Supermarket is located opposite the hotel and sells everything you might need for a low price (full of locals). Obtain a T-10 card (7.95 EURO) if you wish to travel a lot using public transport to get around the city - handy on getting to and from the airport also. If you enjoy walking and only getting public transport at the start and end of the day, a T-10 roughly lasts you for a 3 day trip. Generally public transport is easy to use. If you are below the age of 25, you can get a discounted entry to certain attractions, e.g. Picasso Museum, so bring your Student PhotoID.

It was ignored and I was simply told that we were already given an upgraded room which is not true. The location is not that great. We asked for direction from the reception 3-4 times and each time we were given a short answer that is vague, with no details of the street names, landmarks, or to which direction is the bus going to. 15 - 20 mins walk to Diagonal Metro is quite a long walk. If you wait for the bus, it's sometimes a long wait especially on weekends. And now, I read a reply in TA from the Management that the closest metro station is Gracia which is about 5-7 minutes walking distance. No one ever told us this when we were asking for the nearest Metro. The receptionists were not very helpful nor friendly...answering your queries with short answers lacking of important details made me feel unwelcomed. There were 2 small common fridge in each level, but since these were full most of the time, your food & drinks don't really get cold. And also because of this, there were only a few free bottled water that can fit into the small fridge. I would rather have a fridge in my room where I can store my food & drinks. The room is clean, the bathroom is quite small, the free cabled internet in our room is good (but not that ideal as it is not wireless so only one computer can be use at a time), and the best is the 2 computer with printer at the lobby.

Our visit was after a cruise in April. We wanted a CLEAN room, in a SAFE neighborhood, that was QUIET, and near restaurants and transportation to the downtown area. We got it all and then some. The room was amazing clean and well kept. There is no good t.v. but we could get some BBC for news and weather. Very modern. Be sure to get directions and a map at the front desk. The staff was helpful, but my 2 prong European plug didn't fit into the recessed Spanish recepticle. I could not find an adaptor for the 4 days we were there so I had no curling iron, and no camera after the 2nd day because we couldn't recharge it. Bummer! That was a big disappointment. We had a big window that opened up into the inside open quadrant of the hotel so no windows looked into ours. We left the window open all night. The only noise was the sound of rain! It was humid and the hallways were very warm. The air conditioning was good but preset at the desk. We would have liked it a little cooler but we managed with the open window and the air. I am not sure how good it would be in the summer when it gets really warm! There was a little 'frig outside in the hall with ice cold water, but it empties by mid morning and you need to get water down at the front desk. The elevator was tiny and there was only room for 3 people or 1 person with bags. But who cares? It was functional and there was another small elevator around the corner in the hall. The surprise was a little supermarket right across the street. We could fill up with snacks to take for the day . That was great!!! It is 2 blocks to the shopping area and transportation hub. There is also a Starbucks up there where we bought coffee and sandwiches. Wish we had also known about Bopan. We bought the 2 day ticket for the double decker bus, BUT IT STARTED 3 DAYS OF RAIN the next day and- first -you can't sit upstairs or outside (obviously) and- second -the windows inside are all fogged up and YOU CAN\"T SEE A DAMN THING! BORING! The bus tour is great outside but be sure you check the weather report before you buy your 2 day ticket. The second day you may be out of luck. As a result, we got out and walked everywhere with an umbrella. We got to see more but we got soaked (So the curling iron turned out to be unnecessary anyway). The photos were grey and bleak and the camera got wet. Guess we need a second try at Barcelona. We loved the Cathedrals and museums there and our favorite place was the Gaudi Park. At least the first day was sunny and warm. There is complimentary access to a computer which was a God send as we were trying to get out of Europe before the Icelandic volcano belched out more smoke and ash (we were flying home through London.) The last night we walked up to the corner and turned right and walked down 2 blocks to a wonderful Italian restaurant on the corner. Very close and very good. We tried to get on a bus to go to a 13th century Monastery that was fairly close but we found most bus drivers don't speak English and DON\"T WANT YOU TO ASK QUESTIONS OR BOTHER THEM! So we got lost, got off the bus and walked down to the port and walked back on the Ramblas. Ouch! Barcelona is a beautiful city with a lot to see. We will return to the Hotel Condado someday.

The rooms are small but trendy, although the green, glass, see-thru bathroom door takes a minute to get used to. If you're travelling with someone you are not that close with, it could be an issue. Those free-spirits who can poop in front of anyone - rock on! The hotel has smartly taken part in energy reduction by requiring your room key to operate the electricity in the room. This is done by placing the key in a switch on the entry wall. The small downside is there is no clock in the room. (The time would always be wrong!) Also, there is no iron in the hotel. (Evidently a norm throughout Spain). It is quite pricey to have the hotel iron a garment for you. There is no fridge in the room either, however, there are two located near the elevators on each floor, for community use, as well as one in the hotel lobby that is equipped with complimentary water daily. The king size mattress is actually two twins, made up separately, and joined together on a king size frame. The mattress itself is like sleeping on a cinderblock. But the room did have a balcony, which was a great feature, and the rooms are nice and quiet, especially for such a well populated neighborhood. The staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Like most hotels, the buffet breakfast offered is ridiculously priced. There are many, many options for a continental breakfast in easy walking distance (Atleast 4 options just within one block).

It seemed that the main complaint was the friendliness, or lack thereof, of the front desk staff so I was slightly prepared. When I went to check in, I was asked for my passport with no explanation, given a key and told to come back down 5-10 minutes later to get my passport. Okay...thanks? I got to my room and tried to turn on the lights which didn't work any where. I finally saw a place for my key as I was on my way back to the lobby. That would have been something helpful to tell me upon check in, no? When I finally got the lights on I saw just how TINY the room was. If all floors are the same layout, it was the x06 room which according to the layout is the smallest room on the floor. There were 2 table lamps and a window that looked in to a \"courtyard\" that was about 6x6 which meant no sunlight would come in the room. The shower was really poorly lit as well, and by poorly I mean not at all. For some reason my cell phone couldn't find a signal so I was forced to use the room phone to make an international call to the US. I called reception to see if it was possible and to ask how much it would cost. The person who answered offered no help whatsoever. I was told that I could make the call, but he had no idea what it would be. \"Maybe 30 cents a minute? I don't know.\" I asked what they would bill me at check out and again, \"I don't know.\" Not sure how they couldn't know the rates. The night before checkout I requested a taxi be called for me in the morning that accepted Visa. This was arranged without issue but when I got to the airport the ride was $20 more than my trip out to the hotel, which was apparently because I had used a card. I don't fault the hotel for this, but I think it'd be beneficial to at least warn people who ask for a cab that accepts cards that there is a ridiculous surcharge. I would have gladly gone to an ATM had I known.

I thought (mistakenly) that it was included in the price of the room, but when I checked out there was a 12 Euro charge tacked onto my bill.

If you haven't been to Barcelona, you should know that L'Eixample is the original upscale \"suburb\" (100 years ago) of the main center of Barcelona - not exactly near where all the tourist attractions and tourist shops are crammed together. In terms of location: you have a great advantage of being away from all the touristy postcard/trinket stops that most Barcelona visitors wade through. You are experiencing a much more real Barcelona than those staying at one of the zillion hotels near Las Ramblas. This neighborhood is very trendy and upscale, with so many cute, lovely boutique shops (again, for natives, not tourists). If you are a window shopper, you are in heaven! The streets are wide with generous sidewalks and bike paths. If I could afford to live in this L'Eixample District, I would do it in heartbeat. We loved that it was nice and safe at night. We loved that we ate coffee and pastry for breakfast with all Spaniards, not tourists. However, the downside is that you are a 15-minute walk from the nearest metro stop (Diagonal). However, you can easily catch a bus down to Las Ramblas - no worries. There is also a direct bus to Parc Guell. Also, in this upscale neighborhood, the restaurants are pricey: pricey in a quality-restaurant way, not in an overpriced-rip-off-tourists way. As for the hotel decor, the lobby is minimalist, modern and elegant, with rich woods and plush sofas. Same with the rooms: crisp white bed, cappuccino wood furniture and floors - all in a very elegant modern style. Two adults with two big suitcases fit in just fine. Bonus #1: The hotel provides unlimited cold bottled water for guests. Bonus #2: The hotel has one computer with internet and a printer for use in the lobby. I never had to wait to use it. Downside #1: The hotel's laundry is ridiculously overpriced! For example: 4E for one undergarment. When I asked the front desk for an alternate Laundromat nearby, I was disappointed to learn that they could not direct me to one. They told me any other wash& fold service nearby would be just as expensive. So, I took a 6E cab ride to another neighborhood where I learned of a cheap self-service Laundromat. Downside #2: The hotel's buffet breakfast looked nice, but no way am I paying 12E for my breakfast, when there is a diverse assortment of coffee shops across the street.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Schwetzingen, Germany", "Title": "\u201cAll as expected....

Oh, and did I say it was stylish with a black, gray and white decor. The location was very practical while out of the touristy route. A block away was a good bakery where we breakfasted most days, but the hotel also had an excellent, if pricey breakfast. What was excellent about the location was that it was a comfortable walk to the northern end of the Rambla, just a block or two farther to one of Gaudi's apartment/museums. A bus stopped on the street by the hotel coming up from the old town/harbor area which we caught around the block from the hotel going the other way. I thought the buses were better than the subway because (a) they went more places, and (b) there weren't so many pick pockets. (My partner got his wallet picked in the sub way but we made them give it back. All was well that ended well.) The men at the desk of the hotel were very helpful in guiding us to use the transportation system and also giving excellent restaurant recommendations. Eight to ten blocks away were many many restaurants on or near the Rambla. We ate in a number of different places with Tapas and didn't really have a bad meal, thanks to the guidance of our hotel.

I searched HARD to find a hotel in BCN in this price range (85 euros w/o breakfast) and at this level of quality. I found virtually everything about the hotel to be great. Our rooms were spotless and very quiet. In both cases, we had a small terrace which was wonderful to have. We even left the door open at night and the street sounds were only a murmur of white noise. The showers are great. One of our stays, we even had a bathtub. The beds are comfortably solid. There are safes in each room. The neighborhood is fine for walking at night. There are restaurants nearby for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The personnel were entirely pleasant and helpful. The lads we encountered at the desk are perhaps a bit serious but plenty helpful. They helped us with restaurants, taxis, museums, and buses. We communicated entirely in castellano, though we heard other guests using English with staff at the main desk. One complaint voiced often in comments is that the hotel is far from the metro. The desk staff can help you with buses, taxis, trains, and metro. For example, we took a bus from Diagonal (about a two block walk) directly to Plaza Espanya in order to go to the Museo Nacional de Arte de Catalunya. Another possibility is the ferrocarril, which connects to the metro and stops nearer to the hotel. The easiest walk FROM the metro is the Fontana stop. It is downhill to the hotel and a nice walk. The easiest walk TO the metro is the Diagonal stop, also a nice walk. Another option is the Bus Turistic. You can get a pass for one day (21 euros) or two days (27 euros) and you can hop on and off. There are 3 routes with 6 transfer points, one of which is pretty near the hotel at Plaza Francesc Macia. This bus might be an option if you want to see sights as well as get transported around the city. Another frequent complaint in comments is the cost of the breakfast. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel. We ate at a nearby panaderia called Bopan, on Travessera de Gracia within 3 blocks of the hotel. Great coffee, bocadillos de jamon, tortilla de patata, and croissant. Total for two of us was under 15 euros. There is a great lunch restaurant nearby as well, La Llesca. It serves traditional Catalan cuisine. You can order a la carte. Be aware that the restaurant allows smoking (some don't--BIG change from even 5 years ago). I find the food and ambiance worth it. Hotel Condado has a free minibar on each floor and in the lobby where you can get bottles of water, coke, or non-alcoholic beer. This was a real plus. I highly recommend this hotel.

The hotel lobby is spacious and very clean. There is a computer available to use but it was nearly always in use. However, there didn't tend to be a queue for it so only had to wait five minutes. We had to family rooms - two rooms joined through a small connection. The rooms are very clean and tidy and neatly laid out. They are a bit on the small side however, and a mirror in the room would have been a good idea. It was great to have two rooms for the family. The free mini-bar is a fantastic idea but it does clear out fairly quickly. If you want water I would recommend getting it in the evening as there is not chance of getting it in the morning! My main complaint about the rooms was the door - not the actual door to the rooms but the door to the small corridor you needed to get into to get to the rooms. The lock was a real nuisance. We struggled to open it, it didn't work! Eventually, we opened it. This happened on every occasion we wanted to get into the rooms. As you can imagine, we were very tired after a hard day sightseeing and just wanted to get in! This was really annoying and my main complaint. The hotel is situated a good half an hour away from La Rambla (centre) and, although this walk was pleasant as first, it did become a bit of a trek! I would recommend somewhere closer to the centre as there are more restaurants there and it is more lively. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel (as recommended by other reviewers) and instead went to this fantastic patisserie just down the road. It is called elFornet (turn right outside the hotel, walk 100 yards and cross the road). The food is very reasonably priced and tasty. A Starbucks is also found around the corner. In La Rambla, we went to a great restaurant called The Attic which served fantastic food. Highly recommended. I would recommend getting the bus for travelling around the city. Just ask at reception in the hotel for which bus you need to take to get anywhere. They are very knowledgeable and save you the hassle of muddling through tourist guides.

Our room was small, but very clean and did not have that bare/sterile feel that I've experienced in a lot of other budget hotels. The shower was surprisingly large and a real treat after spending all day on our feet in the heat. I did think it was a little weird that the door separating the toilet from the rest of the room was only a swinging piece of frosted glass that didn't actually close. The complimentary drinks were awesome. They could have been better stocked, but we could usually find what we needed by going to another floor. The staff were courteous and we had no trouble communicating. There is a supermarket directly across the street which we found very convenient. We did not pay for breakfast and found it very easy to grab breakfast within a block or two of the hotel at one of the numerous bakery-type places. We liked Bopan the best on Travessera de Gracia, about a block away. The free internet access in the lobby was very convenient, but consistently in use, so we did have to wait each time we needed it. If you think you will need to use the internet often, it would be better to have your own computer and use free internet in your room. We loved the location.

AC unit is also quiet and worked w/out problems. We did not use the terrace much because we were not spending much time in the hotel anyway, and because of the noise. The noise is not specific to this particular road, Barcelona is absolutely gorgeous city, but it is extremely noisy, especially the center. Well, back to the hotel. The breakfast was included in the price and was nice, not very big, but the bread, cheeses and pastries were fresh every day. There is a food shop right across the road from the hotel, and we got a few snacks from there, so it is convenient too. Coca, one type of beer and water are in the fridges located on each floor, the only problem that we had was that our floor ran out of water one evening.But the next morning the fridge was full again. There is no WIFI connection on the upper floors, the reception gave me ethernet cable to connect my laptop. The cable is relatively short so the computer can stay connected only on the table (no lazy browsing on the bed).

We were in room 101, and both of our windows (one near the bed, the other in the bathroom) looked out on to a central, atrium-like area (but there was nothing atrium-like about it). We were only on the second floor, and we could have stepped out of our windows on to a little area with what seemed to be huge air conditioning ductwork. When I looked out our window initially, I could see a girl in a room near ours putting on makeup in her bathroom (she had her window open). It was a little awkward. Worst of all, we had absolutely no natural light coming into our room. We were at this hotel for the last three nights of our ten day stay in Spain, and we suddenly felt as though we were jet lagged again. It was so disorienting for it to be morning and still be very dark in our room. The lobby and common areas are beautifully decorated, and the staff guy who checked us in seemed nice. He gave us a good recommendation for a nearby restaurant when we asked for one, and we did have a very nice meal there (the Cros Diagonal). We opted not to do the buffet breakfast at the hotel---it was quite expensive, and we were perfectly content to walk a few blocks to a cafe to have some tea and a pastry or baguette. We had planned on returning our rental car after checking into the Hotel Condado, but the car place was closed on Sundays, so we had to park overnight and return the car the next morning. We arrived at the hotel around 8:00 pm or so. When my husband went out at 9:00 am the next morning to return the car, he had to pay a whopping 25 euros for the parking. It was shocking. The parking was just city parking, as the hotel does not have any, and that was with (we believe) the special rate for staying in the hotel. It was around the corner from the hotel, so my husband unloaded our bags, which I stayed with in the lobby while he went to go park. We thought the location of the hotel was quite good. Barcelona seems to be fairly spread out, so we didn't think there was necessarily a better area to stay in. We ended up walking a lot, taking a couple of cabs (which weren't too expensive), and riding the Barcelona Bus Turistic. Never managed to use the subway or city buses. The hotel is in a great location if you want to use the Barcelona Bus Turistic...we simply walked to the Placa de Francesc Macia, and were able to get on both the red and blue lines there. It seemed to be a good, not too in demand, place to get on. Other stops had long lines, and many people weren't able to sit on the top of these double decker buses because the top was already full. As for our room, another drawback was that the two pillows on the bed were very thin and insubstantial. I would have liked another one just to put under my head. Being 6 months pregnant, it would have been nice to have at least another one or two more, as well. The room was very clean, but the bathroom floor looked dirty when we first arrived. It wasn't very bad, but I would say that I'm not terribly paranoid about dirty hotel rooms and yet I noticed it and was a little bothered by it. I did like that the bathroom sink area is separate from the shower and toilet area. That can help save a little time getting ready in the morning. We didn't like the key we were given for our room. That seems a funny thing to say, but it was this huge bulky thing with an enormous tassel as a keychain. A small card key is a lot less troublesome to carry around, especially when you're planning to walk around all day and want to carry as little as possible. I was a little bothered by all the things I'd read about the clever pickpockets in Barcelona, so I carried a little canvas bag diagonally across my torso. Even after taking a number of precautions, I still worried that if a pickpocket got my bag, he'd have no trouble going to our hotel room and cleaning us out of our things there. \"Hotel Condado\" and \"Room 101\" were very clearly marked on our key. That seemed rather stupid to me. One last thing: we asked for wake-up calls all three mornings, and while we did get them, some combination of the cave-like feeling of our room and the low volume on our phone caused us to oversleep all three mornings. I slept next to the phone, picked it up, hung up, and fell back asleep every day. My husband never heard the phone at all, apparently. Yes, we were tired from packing our days very full, but we don't normally have problems oversleeping. This wasn't too big a deal until our last morning there, when we slept through our wake up call, and my husband just happened to wake up fifteen minutes before we were supposed to leave for the airport. Fortunately, we were all packed and just needed showers, but it was a far from ideal way to get ready for our imminent nine hour flight home. If I could be sure I wouldn't get a room with no view, I might consider staying at this hotel again. Honestly, though, when I think back about our few days in Barcelona now, that dark room was a really depressing place to be in such a sunny and busy city.", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cA great find!\u201d", "Author": "AtlantaGina", "ReviewID": "UR30445887", "Content": "We spent two nights at Hotel Condado, prior to joining a cruise that departed from Barcelona.

The breakfast area is spacious and the breakfast itself was probably the best we've had at hotels of this size/price point. Breakfast was included in our room rate and we had a wonderful selection of cereals, pastries, fresh fruit, yogurt - even eggs and sausage. Add hot coffee that was delivered to your table by the very nice servers and you've got the perfect start to your day. Eat up because Barcelona is a big city and you'll quickly walk off any calories you eat at breakfast! The rooms in the hotel are simply, but nicely furnished. They are good size for Europe and were comfortable and clean. The air conditioning worked well and the bathroom was large with plenty of hot water for your shower. One of the best perks of this hotel - as simple as it sounds - is the free water/soda that can be found in the mini-bar on each floor. It was such a treat to grab a water on the way out or enjoy a nice Coke and a brief rest before heading out for more touring.

Essentially, the hotel is a 5-10 minute walk from the Diagonal metro stop at the top of Passeig de Gracia. If you walked from the hotel to Plaza Catalunya or Sagrada Familia (we did both) it's probably 30 minutes. We love to walk everywhere, so this hotel was centrally located for much of what we did. We also took the metro to Parc Guell and Montjuic, and we found Barcelona's metro system very convenient and easy to use. There were plenty of restaurants and cafe's near the hotel and there is a supermarket across the street from the hotel which was nice. Finally, we really enjoyed the service given by the hotel staff.

I remembered that the hotel had specifically contacted us to fill out a review on tripadvisor. Here goes... As for our experience at the Hotel Condado, we had a mixed experience. The downstairs hotel staff was very helpful. The rooms were nice. The free drinks (soda and water) were a nice surprise as well. We did have two big disappointments after staying at the hotel for 5 nights. First, we had asked for a single room, and our confirmation indicated we had gotten a family room for 4 people. In my notes to the hotel, I had specified that we wanted a single room, but we received two rooms that were joined by a small space with the outer door. This situation of two rooms was not made clear to us, because we thought all 4 of us would be sharing a room. They actually do not have a single room for 4 people (according to what the front desk told us). Instead, they have 2 separate rooms that is separated by a small shared area that can be locked from the outside. The interesting thing is that they charge you for 2 rooms, although you may ask for just one. This situation was either unintentional or deceptive, but either way, it was not what we expected. The second problem we had was with the cleaning service. We posted do not disturb on the door at least 3 different days we were there. Every single time without fail, they would come into the room even when the posted \"Do not Disturb\" sign was on the door knob. We were sick on our 4th day, and I had to worry about them coming in while I was sick (Sure enough, they attempted to come in). This was completely unacceptable. Why have those signs for guests to hang from their doorknob if they are completely disregarded? As far as location, the hotel was a bit further north from Las Ramblas that we would have liked.
