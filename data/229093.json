Front desk staff were pretty laid back and didn't pay too much attention to you, but remember you are in Italy after all :-) Breakfast was mixed review between the Mrs and myself. First all, if you go during summer then you will experience breakfast on the rooftop of the hotel which is amazing. The food served is very basic. 2 cereals (some type of corn flake and some muesli) there are no eggs or bacon (I am sure if there was that they wouldn't be that great anyway) but there were the usual croissants, fruits, yogurts ect... Overall not bad, but you will most likely need to snack during the day. Check out was easy, just give back the key and your gone. If you are intending to utilize the train service then this hotel is great because Rome Termini is only a short walk up the road. We did it with 2 large suitcases with ease. Overall an easy stay in the heart of Rome which didn't cost the world and you can get around on foot very easily.

The Hotel is very well placed. minutes from some beautiful sites, minutes to the hop on hop off bus (20 euro for 24 hours) and 5 minutes walk to the train station. Also the evening staff were very helpful and gave us lots of recommendations and organised transfers for us (the day staff were not as helpful). They organised airport to hotel transfer for 55 euro and to the Cruise Port for 120 Euro and Cruise Port to Airport for 110 Euro. The also recommended a number of local restaurants. We enjoyed the pavement restaurant to the right of the hotel (when facing) it was open until 2am, had a very broad menu and the staff were great. There are dozens of restaurants within walking distance but be aware it is expensive to eat out in Rome (but then it is in most City centres). If your on a budget there are a couple of take away pizza shops in the same road and a store which is open to 11 where you can buy drinks and icecream. The hotel has free wifi which was great. Now unfortunately to the downside. We stayed 3 days and it was very hot. We complained daily that the aircon did not work - to be fair they provided us with 2 fans almost immediately but the room was quite unbearable outside of the fan draft. We had a strange room for 3 with an annex round the corner for my sons bed. He had a window - our room was windowless so with no aircon you can imagine. We did consider leaving our bedroom door open as the outside corridor was lovely and cool and managed to fight the urge. The fridge was also broken in our room and we had been hoping to keep cokes and water we had bought for ourselves cold which did not happen. Window in the bathroom offered two options closed or fully wide open - which I do not recommend as there are at least 20 windows which looked into the bathroom. TV was old fashioned and had 9 channels with just the one in English which was CNN and that channel only worked for one day. The shower was broken and we often had to leave it running for ages to get hot water - luckily it was so hot in the room we did not mind the cool water. Many of the tiles in the bathroom were hanging off as was much of the wallpaper in the bedroom - really the room we were in was in desparate need of an overhaul. Breakfast is served on the top floor which has beautiful views all over Rome. There are 12 tables so if you have a lay in there is a bit of a scrum for somewhere to sit, also the buffet kept running out but the one waiter who worked up there did he best and was running around to please everyone. Unfortunately, there were dozens of wasps up there and many people jumping up and running round to get away from them. To be fair there has been an outbreak of wasps everywhere this year. The area is open all day if you want somewhere to sit in the sun but there are no drinks up there so take your own up. There is a room safe and lots of wardrobe space but the room was covered in dust - on the lights, bedframe, tables.

Just a helpful note, there is a fantastic restaurant about 100 yds from the entrance. Turn left out of the main door and its a small fronted building with a pianist in the window. You may not notice it during the day as it has metal shutters over the windows....but ayt night, this is probably the finest place i've eaten (for my budget) in Rome.

Upon arrival we left our luggage in reception (as check in is 1pm, I've noticed some people seem annoyed when told they can't check in, but that's when it is and it says when you book). I also didn't think anything of them taking our passports when we first arrived, as they gave them back when we came back downstairs. We went for a look around the immediate area before check in, and the main central travel hub for Rome (Termini Station) is 5 mins walk away from the hotel (you could see it from our room). Here you can catch any number of buses, trains, the tram or metro to anywhere in Rome. Also underneath the hotel a few doors down is a supermarket/bar which sells pastries/drinks etc. but are quite expensive. If you're looking for cheap bottled water try one of the shops on the way to Termini which sells bottles for 50 cents. The room was very large (room 308), and had one double bed (Note to other reviews, according to my research on-line it is normal in Italy for a double bed frame to have two single mattresses pushed together rather than one large mattress). Also present was a free electronic locking safe, sofa, TV, wardrobe (see picture) and huge bathroom. The room seemed very traditional and of Italian d\u00e9cor, and wasn't in disrepair like I have read in other reviews. We had 3 large windows, 2 of which overlooked the beautiful Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore across the street (see picture). We did notice a slight sewage smell upon entering the room each time, but this became unnoticeable after 1 minute in the room and is seriously not a reason to not book a room at this hotel. I have noticed other reviews of 308 are good too, this is possibly because in high season the hotel can charge around 400 Euros a night for this room (as it says on a piece of information in the room itself). Needless to say I got the room last minute for 225 Euros for 3 nights and we were overall impressed. The only negative feature of the hotel we found is we found it quite hard to sleep some nights, however this was not due to noise outside despite the hotel being on a busy-ish road (the windows are pretty soundproof), I think it was just because the bed was not what we were used to. Also, the front desk staff whilst being very friendly were not as helpful as we have found with recommendations as staff are in other countries such as Spain. For example, he did give us some recommendations but they weren't personal, rather they were from business cards that restaurants had left in the hotel. Having said that, it's probably more likely due to how the Italians came across generally to me than the level of their professionalism at this hotel; I'm sure that we British seem moody and unhelpful to tourists! Worth mentioning as a good point too is the breakfast (7-10am), which was included in the price of our booking. Choice includes everything in a traditional Italian breakfast amongst other things, coffee and tea (which are brought fresh to you by a waitress when you enter the room), meat, cheese, bread, sweet croissants, yoghurt, cereal, fruit, cake. We forgot to look at the roof terrace as the weather was mainly cold during our stay but can imagine eating breakfast on the roof with the great view would be amazing. As I already mentioned, the location is great. Termini, whilst not being the most attractive area is a major transport link to the rest of the city. If you travel past the station (as we did when we went to Formula 1 pizza), expect graffiti on every single wall and on most vans and cars. However, don't let this put you off, as you will probably not need to go any further North East than the station itself when visiting Rome, we just happened to go that way on our first night for pizza. Also, this is probably the only area we saw during our stay that was like this, and we covered almost the entire city. Overall we were very impressed with this hotel and it's price. The view is beautiful (make sure to visit inside the Basilica) and if you want to be at a good starting position for visiting the sights of Rome then near Termini is the place to be. Something else worth mentioning is the star rating system in Italy/Rome. It is not the same as elsewhere around the world, hotels are star rated according to what/how many facilities they provide, so 4 star Hotel Gallia is not the same as 4 star Hilton or something like that!

This is what I said about the Gallia, and I can't wait to return. Hope the three coins in the fountain works! We stayed for three days in May 2008. It was within walking distance of the main station and right next door to the Santa Maria church which is one of the loveliest churches I have ever been into. Yes, the hotel is old - but then Rome is old. I liked the old atmosphere and the quaint rooms, unusual shapes, a triangular bathroom, roomy, with bath as well as shower. I liked the bedroom, very comfortable, with a well stocked bar and drinks on the house. It was all clean and we slept well. Yes, the noise of Rome is outside - but then we were not staying on an isolated island! We had not chosen a peaceful holiday. I liked the passionate roar of the traffic and the music of church bells but more than anything, I loved...adored...the roof garden. After exploring the sights, it was lovely to return to the Gallia late afternoon. My husband always had a nap on the comfortable bed, but I took a glass of wine and my book up to the roof garden and could have stayed there forever! I hardly read actually, I just wanted to take in the spectacle of Rome around me. I could look over on to other roof gardens, the glistening white church next door, and across the rooftops of Rome, towards the Vatican. In the summer, breakfast is served on the roof. What a place to have breakfast! The other thing I appreciated was that all the main sights, apart from the Vatican, are a short walk away from the hotel. Ten minutes takes you to the Coliseum, another five minutes and you are walking along Via del Corso,a most beautiful street, another ten mins (if you don't stop to shop) and you can be at the Spanish Steps. In a side street near there is my favourite cafe, the Cafe Grecco, one of the first cafes in Rome, visited by many famous people and now serves delicious food in an old fashioned, beautifully decorated atmosphere. Mext to the Spanish steps is the Shelley Memorial House, open to visitors. Another ten minutes and you can be at the Trevi fountain. Walk to the end of the Via del Corso and you come to the Plaza del Popolo, and from there you really must walk up to the Borghese gardens. The Pantheon is another must; wonderful inside. One of my favourite piazzas is the Navona, not far from the Pantheon; I like eating here. But we found a gem....in the same street as the Gallia hotel, just a few doors down, we happened to go into a restaurant because I liked the fact that there was someone playing a piano! What we found, in this small back street restaurant, away from the touristy places, was a family run restaurant, where a lot of locals eat, with home made food and a lovely atmosphere. I would go back to the same restaurant again. Unfortunately, I can't remember the name of it but it is close to the hotel on the same side of the street. So all of this is close to the Hotel Gallia, apart from the Vatican, across the river. We made the mistakke of going by taxi, booking it from the hotel. Cost \u00a350. Another time it will be bus! And there is a long wait to get into the Vatican, about two hours at least. Although I believe I read somemwhere that you can book in advance and go straight in. The wait was well worth it. This hotel is away from the main touristy area yet close to the sights; it is a delightful place to stay. I wouldn't call it luxurious, but had character, cleanliness and comfort.

The hotel is only a short walk (10 mins) from Termini Station which is the main station in the city (you can get a train direct from Da Vinci Airport to Termini).", "Date": "January 19, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Gallia Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d229093-Reviews-Gallia_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$100 - $273*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Di Santa Maria Maggiore 143</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "229093", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9b/5d/9b5d3fe318c048ee34734bd64f461d9d5large.jpg"}}
