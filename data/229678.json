Hotel is located in suburbs but is about 600m from the nearest Metro and as such only 15mins from the centre of town.

Also nearby are a number of other hotels, and also a large commercial centre \"Diagonal Mar\" which offers various restaurants in addition to the numerous small local bar/cafe/restaurants. All in all for our family this worked really well. The hotel is very good; the staff were all very helpful and spoke good English. The rooms were good in particular for a family of 4 two linked twin rooms worked very well. We all rated the breakfast the best we have come across at any hotel. The only warning to add about the hotel is if you want fitness facilities - there is no gym and the pool is really just a splash pool for the hotter times of the year.

Very clean and modern with friendly staff. Thought we had been given a smoking room ( we requested a non-smoking) so called down to reception. Within 5 minutes a member of staff was at our door armed with an air freshner spray. Turned out it was a non smoking room and the smell came from the spray she used! Excellent service though. Not much of a view (room 516, top floor) but weren't too bothered as we were out most of the time. Pool, not the biggest, but very welcoming and relaxing, very comfortable loungers and plenty of seating, nice roof top view of Barcelona. Good choice for continental breakfast - cereals, meats, fruit, toast, yogurts etc. Husband asked for an omelette which they did for no extra charge and he didn't wait long for it either. 5 minute walk to nearest shopping centre which has loads of shops and eateries. Same distance to nearest metro stop - Selva del Mar. Would reccomend buying a T10 ticket - 10 journeys on the metro, tram, train or bus for less than 9 euros per person. the train also goes direct from the airport to the centre of Barcelona. Drinks and food quite expensive on Ramblas and by the port area (11 euros for 2 pints of lager and a coke!!) so would suggest going off the beaten track and finding where the locals drink, lots of fabulous bars and lounges to visit. 'Cheers bar' is a great place for watching the footie with the locals, near to a couple of British bars. Weather was very good for November - 21-24 degrees.

There are no busy night clubs and noisy bars close to the hotel which was appreciated by us. There are however some nice bars on the beach :-). We did not find any interesting restaurants close to the hotel but maybe we didn't search to well....so we had dinner downtown. Remember that the Metro stops running from 00.00..... Breakfast at the hotel? Well, we did not eat breakfast at the hotel because of the price.... If you want a trip by the Bus touristic (hop-on-hop-off), ask the staff for tickets. It seems that the hotel can offer cheaper tickets than if you buy them from the bus driver. We returned very back to the airport by bus (a lot cheaper than by taxi).

The city/ La Rambla is around 20 minutes on the metro. Barcelona itself was not at all what i expected, we went for the football side of things but stayed for a few extra days to see the sights. Apart from the Nou Camp i did not enjoy barcelona, its full of horrible people who clearly do not like tourists and the customer service is appauling.
