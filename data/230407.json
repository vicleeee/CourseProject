After all, in this city, who wants to stay indoors a moment longer than you need to? Cleanliness could have been better, e.g. dusty on horizontal surfaces, and glasses in rooms needed another rinse before use. Extractor fan in bathroom not working. Air conditioning noisy and either froze or baked you depending on its mood! Breakfast buffet was good, but beware of the bacon, which was about as palatable as shoe leather. Staff were pleasant and efficient. Mini bar in room was very reasonably priced, certainly compared with the outrageous prices charged in the UK. All in all, nothing major to complain about. My leaving tip? If you're travelling as a couple or a family get the hotel to order a taxi for your return trip to the airport. It is not much more expensive than the train, and the route out of the city will take you past many of the great sights, so it is a perfect way to leave.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eden Prairie, Minnesota, United States", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel in great location, well worth it.\u201d", "Author": "Bobbi H", "ReviewID": "UR127078346", "Content": "Very clean and comfortable, in great location.

The only REAL 4 stars hotel we\u2019ve been so far (and we travel through 9 countries within 5 years and stayed in many hotels) was Hotel Maxim in Verona, Italy. I cannot say Royal Court would really fit to this level. First of all, I would specifically NOT recommend this hotel for winter period. Their heating system is based on air conditioning and the bathrooms are not heated. For a bathroom made of marble, floor and walls, this can be a problem: it\u2019s almost like a freezer. This problem was increased by the fact they did NOT provide sleepers (and we thought we are coming to a 4 stars hotel and we did not take sleepers with us). Imagine how is to get from a sort of heated room into the freezing bathroom, with the marble floor and sit on the icy toilet. It reminded me what I read about the tortures from medieval era. Paying 90 euro/night for this seemed a bit masochistic. The breakfast was ok, with few options, including scrambled eggs and bacon, muesli and yogurt, salami, yellow cheese, few different fruits, coffee and tea, juices and some chocolate cake. Compared with the royal breakfast we had in Maxim (for 58 euro/night), this one was pretty lame. The staff was excellent, especially Mary and Donald. If it was not for Mary, we would have left before checking in. The Italian guy (I believe he was Italian) seemed a bit insolent. We would probably go again to Rome, there are so many more things to see and visit, but for sure we will chose a different hotel, wisely this time. There are few more unpleasant details but I am too disappointed to talk about them anymore.

The wifi was good only because the hotel was not full, but the tv lacked variety as it only provided one English channel (BBC) and the other 9 channels were either in Italian or French. The movie channel however offered the movies in English but you'd have to watch at around 2 or 4 am to do so. Breakfast was average a typical cold cut sandwich and fruits were offered in the basement where the dinning room is located. The only positive thing I have to say is that it is conveniently located down the street from the Termini Station which made it worth the effort. Line A will take you to most of the sites most commonly sought after and the Line B (blue line) will take you to the other 2 spots.

We didn't go to Rome for the nightclubs or anything like that, we went for a good time and this place fitted the bill perfectly. We booked off lastminute.com and got a great deal to start off with. When we arrived the cheerful receptionist welcomed us and began to check us in and invited us to sit down and relax. As she completed the process, she called me over and informed me that she was upgrading us, FREE OF CHARGE to a delux quadruple room instead of our standard room. When we went in the room, it was perfect. Enough room for what we wanted, comfortable beds and everything clean. The only let down was the fact that the jacuzzi didn't work but, we could deal with that very easily!! We went out every night in Rome and found ti very easy to get a taxi back to Termini and walk up Via Marghera. We were usually home around 12 which was fine and walked straight in. One night we came home about 2am after meeting and talking to two local Romans. When we got back to the hotel, we found that the main gate had been locked. However we simply rang the buzzer and the receptionist came out, smiling again, to let us in and wished a good nights sleep. The staff were all very polite and went out of their way to make us happy on a number of occasions. I will definitely be going back to this hotel. ON A SIDE NOTE.

While the hotel isn't located in a particularly touristy part of town, we never felt unsafe walking around at night, and being a short walk to Termini meant we were always ten minutes from any of the main sights (Vatican City, Colosseum etc.) Only negatives were: 1. Our 'bed' was two single beds pushed together. However, we did only confirm our booking three days before checking in so we didn't expect anything different! 2.

We chose the hotel through good Tripadvisor feedback. Rome is a great city to visit and we loved the wonderful sights, the fantastic food and the general friendliness of the folk there. Whilst there were a few slightly negative aspects to the stay, I would not hesitate to recommend the Royal Court to anyone looking for very decent, quiet accommodation of a perfectly acceptable standard in what can be an expensive city. Getting the negatives out of the way first, our room (standard) was really quite tight for space. Having said that, it was quite manageable and the room space was used to the maximum e.g. large wall mounted plasma TV, all drawers within the wardrobe etc. I suspect our room was amongst the smallest in the hotel and you could well find yourself in something more spacious. Secondly, although the continental style breakfasts were perfectly satisfactory, again tables could be full at certain times resulting in a short wait or a bit of squeezing in. At night, there didn't seem to be a bar area as such, though I believe drinks could be arranged. However the lack of an obvious lounge put us off having a nightcap downstairs. No real worries there as Rome is full of wonderful bars and restaurants. There are a few near the hotel but tend to be around 15 to 20 minutes walk away in the main. Maybe the most negative issue was a bit of a slip up by the hotel in arranging a car to meet us at the airport. We had originally planned to take the train in, as Termini Station is only a 7 minute safe walk away. However it became obvious that our flight was going to be delayed to beyond midnight when trains would not be running. I phoned the hotel - admittedly at the last minute from Edinburgh Airport -to arrange a hotel car pick up. Alas it did not show. No matter, a friendly taxi driver took us to the hotel for a similar price (60 euros after midnight). None of the above in any way detracted from the stay. You get really good value here when you check other hotel prices. The rooms were clean and requests (eg more pillows) were dealt with efficiently. There was very little corridor noise and we slept well. Desk staff were really excellent- helpful, cheery and with brilliant English. The location is really good. It is in a nice quiet area that appeared pefectly safe to us. As stated, the station is only a hop away and is great for the metro, tour buses as well as airport transit (provided it's not after midnight!) It is also pretty good from the \"seeing the sights\" angle. Maybe a 20 minute walk to the Colliseum, the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps. Half hour to the Pantheon. The Vatican probably needs a taxi or as we did, hop off the city tour bus. Also recommend vising the Trastevere area which is not on many tour bus routes. Plenty excellent restaurants there in an up and coming trendy part of town. In summary, I genuinely recommend the hotel to anyone looking for best value.

Rooms were recently renovated within the past couple years. Very clean. Housekeeping was fantastic. Everything was refilled and clean towels were provided everyday even though we hung them up to re-use. Overall, the only complaint was the free breakfast (although I probably complain about something provided). It was very European and wasn't what North American's are used to. There was no Orange Juice (just sugary Tang). Milk was warm (again, typical), and there were no eggs. Basically just coffee, pastries, yogurt, and sliced meats. But remember, Termini Station is only 5 min away and it has tons of restaurants - yes, even McDonalds.", "Date": "February 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Methwold, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat little gem\u201d", "Author": "jillysmail", "ReviewID": "UR11595584", "Content": "Lovely hotel that is very convenient for the station and metro although far enough away from main streets not to be noisy.

Enthusiatic Staff\u201d", "Author": "alanw888", "ReviewID": "UR10057919", "Content": "We have just returned from a three night stay at the Royal Court Hotel. The Hotel is located only about 400 yards/metres from the main railway station (Termini), Metro and Bus Station but most of the tourist attractions if you are considering walking to them are the 'other' side of the station. Open topped Sightseeing buses stop/wait in the busstation. Also, the hotel, is only about 30 yards from the 'Bank of Italy' with its machine gun toting police guards which seems to make it a rather safe area! The Hotel might be best described as a 'boutique' hotel (although I m never really sure what that means). The hotel and rooms are filled with antique furniture, pictures and polished wooden floors but also the necessary modern air con and fridge/minibar. Every room is different so these comments can only reflect the room we sayed in (116). Some rooms had showers, others baths or jaccuzzis.Our room had patio doors leading to a small intimate, shady and tranquil courtyard, Trees, shrubs, flowers and bowls of sweets made this an ideal place to relax, with a couple of beers, after a hectic days sightseeing and before dinner at one of the many local restuarants. Although only two (3?) rooms opened directly on to the courtyard it was accessable to all. There were also lifts to all floors. The staff couldnt have been more helpful and attentive, we particularly liked the 'bellhop/gopher' Romero for whom nothing was to much trouble and always with a smile and at a run... The hotel provided a buffet breakfast although the choices of four cold meats and cheeses were the same each day these were always fresh and never piled high to become 'tired'. The buffet staff kept the quanities small but constantly refreshed, the moment a plate became empty it was immediately filled, an almost seamless and invisible operation to guests. Plenty of choices of fresh fruit, cereals, juices, cream cheeses, yoghurt, jams, bread ,rolls and much more. Breakfast was served between 7 and 10am everyday although the breakfast room was quiet small it was adequate provided everyone didnt arrive at the same time! Prices charge for items from the minibar were quite low compared with other hotels I have stayed at or even the hotels own room service charges but items used were not replaced unless you handed in the 'honesty' sheet at reception each day. It is always possible to find a few things that detract from the overall experience in our case the wash basin plug was too large for the hole so the water slowly leaked away! and the shower tray leaked across the floor and in to the bedroom but only when I used it, I am rather heavy!! My partner is much lighter and no problems. I would also have liked tea/coffee making facilities in the room (Room service was available 24/7). None of these very minor problems could affect our overall view of this excellent hotel. If hotel star ratings refered to the look, feel, atmosphere and staff etc. rather than just the 'on paper' facilities then this hotel would rate far more stars than its allocated 2 star rating.

Breakfast is ok: small selection of breads, cereals, some ham, cheese, jam. Quite small selection, too bad if you're gluten intolerant, or trying to avoid white flour. Long queues to breakfast if you time it wrong as there are only a limited number of tables.

No knee room to get into clothes at all! Supposedly fully airconditioned. Well, we had a portable unit in our room that pumped out cool air for about 8 inches and then dissipated in the heat.

We had a superior double room, one that doesn't have a jacuzzi, but it was still a great tub with nice hardware. The marble floors in the bathroom were charming and the decore was tasteful and not tacky. The breakfast was also very good. As for the location, many guidebooks will tell you not to stay in Termini (station) area because it's a \"tourist ghetto\". That may be true to a certain degree, but the convenience of the location cannot be underestimated. We took the metro (a bit crowded, but extremely efficient) and the bus (excellent system) and never had to pay a cab driver once--all we had to do is buy a 16 euro weekly pass for our 7 day stay. We saved a ton of money that way, and with the dollar falling like a rock, my fellow Americans would be advised to do the same. As for safety, the Termini area is populated by many, many police late into the night, and I never felt the slightest bit unsafe, especially wearing a money belt. While other neighborhoods may be hipper or more atmospheric, this hotel is just far enough from the station for a little peace and quiet, and offered many advantages. One warning: our first night, we were told by the front desk that there was a problem with the toilet in our room, and we were forced to spend the night at a sister property, the Hotel Morgana. We were told the hotel was superior to the Royal Court. It was not. Closer to Termini, the hotel is only partially renovated, and we were stuck in an old portion that had furniture out of a trailer park. Even the renovated rooms did not look nearly as nice. The staff was rude and unsympathetic. I had to throw a fit to make sure we got back into the Royal Court our second night. While I don't know if it was a scam or not, be careful, and make sure you don't get switched. After we returned, however, the Royal Court gave us a bottle of wine to make it up to us, which we appreciated, though we don't drink. If it hadn't been for that incident I would have given them five stars. Highly recommend the Royal Court--delightful property.", "Date": "November 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harrisburg, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in Rome\u201d", "Author": "dburkett", "ReviewID": "UR2853625", "Content": "I stayed at the Royal Court for three nights in November 2004.

The hotel was delightful; there are only twenty-four rooms which made us feel really part of the friendly environment and not just a number like the larger hotels. Our bedroom was very luxurious and had the biggest bed in I have ever seen! The bathroom had a Jacuzzi in which was great. The hotel staff was very helpful and could not do enough for us. You can even have breakfast in bed at no extra charge!! The hotel location is great, it is very close to the main train and bus stations so getting around is extremely easy. You could also walk to a lot of the major sights, which is what we did as the weather was fantastic and we could really soak up all there was to see. The hotel staff told us of some really wonderful restaurants locally and to this day the taste of the food has remained with me.. \u2018bellissima\u2019.

LOCATION:It's located 3 blocks NE of Rome's Termini Station. Though close to the train station, this particular area seems safe. It's across the street from a language school with private residences and corner restaurants nearby. Being near the transportation hub of Rome, we could easily walk to the hotel after arriving on the airport express train, catch early morning trains to other cities and also board any city bus after a day of sight-seeing if \"Termini\" was listed on the destination roster at the bus stops. One advantage of boarding buses at the starting point is you have a choice of seats! We did walk to the Colosseum (1.5 mi) our first day, but Trastevere and Vatican City would have been a stretch. (By taxi, it's 10 Euros to Vatican City from the hotel or 1 Euro by bus). ROOMS: The A/C'd double rooms with walk-in closets (!) were quiet at night, clean and comfortable - elegantly wallpapered with padded brocade. One room was a tad larger than the other two. The rooms were cozy, but not cramped. The large bathrooms were beautiful--marble-tiled floors, bidet (I used mine to soak my feet...)-- our tub/shower had whirlpool jets (!), but the others did not. My son could not understand why they didn't have shower doors or curtains - yes, the floor was a bit wet after his use. BREAKFAST: Very nice continental breakfast - dry cereals, yogurt, salami, mortadella, cheese, and delicious rolls--my sons found the food quite filling and were ready for the day's adventures.

Our room was big for Rome standards, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was luxurious. The room had a safe and a mini bar and the air-conditioning was a welcome relief from the hot outdoors. We were very happy with the buffet breakfast and one morning when my husband was unwell, the wait staff gave me a tray to take food back to our room for him. We discovered the lovely roof top terrace and used it many times to relax after a long day of sightseeing. One can take a drink up to it as there are tables to sit at. There is also a ground floor terrace or \"court\" but it is very small with only one table which was usually occupied by others, so we did not get the opportunity to use it. It looked very charming, though. The staff were very helpful and they recommended tour options and a good restaurant very close by. In our travels we met a fellow traveler who was happy with her accommodation at a convent and was delighted to pay 95 euros for a single room with breakfast. We paid only 125 euros for a family of four (two adults and two children ages 14 and 17), at the Morgana Royal Court, and therefore feel we got the better deal. Rome itself is very beautiful and there is much to see. I would recommend taking taxis over the Metro. We witnessed a robbery of a tourist in the subway and the crush of people trying to get on is somewhat frightening, especially for children. The taxis are much safer and the drivers are friendly and will sometimes give you a commentary on sights you pass by. The cost is not much more than the Metro if there are four of you. There is also a double decker tour bus, which goes by all the sights and you can get on and off along the route. The Vatican and St. Peter's is not to be missed. One word of warning, however, if you visit St. Peter's: the trip up to the cupola does not tell you the space gets very small and can be overwhelming if you are uncomfortable in small spaces. It is one way up and one way down, so don't attempt it unless you plan to continue all the way. The elevator takes you to the first tier which is stupendous all in it's own. Then you have the option to climb the winding stairway up to the top.
