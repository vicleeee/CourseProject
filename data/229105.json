Reception staff, seeing us traveling with a toddler, insisted (!) that double bed will be better than two twins for us, which turned out to be true. Chambermaids, when realized that we have a baby, left us an extra towel without any request. Many rooms have balconies - ours had a small window with very elaborate internal and external shutters.

If you travel by bus from terminal (buses 86, 92, 217, 360), keep in mind that some streets are one-way and the stop for the hotel could be a little hard to find (most buses will stop at Via Po and Via Ofanto). Going to terminal / downtown, the bus stop is right on Via Salaria. You buy tickets or buses at tobacco shops, which are everywhere and marked by large \u201cT\u201d above entrance. Easiest (if not closest) subway stop to reach is Termini. That said, the walk between hotel and terminal is not too bad either (~20 minutes with luggage and stroller): from terminal you\u2019d need to turn right on Via Battaglia, at p.za Indipindenza turn left on Goito and stay on it while it turns into Piave and then Salaria, after a large park turn right onto Ada.

Although I've been to Rome before, the two friends I was travelling with had not, and having read the reviews I was worried that the hotel might be too far away from the centre. In fact, we couldn't have chosen a better hotel. The Albani is ideally situated, it's only a few blocks away from the Borghese and there are good bus links into the centre of Rome. The 63, 630 routes take you to all the main tourist sights, and the No 19 tram (all of which are just at the end of the street) takes you direct to St Peters and the Vatican. You can walk to Via Veneto in about 20 minutes,but the bus and tram routes are frequent and fast. Actually, after spending the whole day surrounded by tourists in busy noisy Rome it was really good to get out of the centre and sample a bit of real Rome. There are several restaurants dotted here and there within a short distance from the hotel, and apart from a smattering of tourists, they mainly cater for locals. It was great to be in a quieter area mixing with locals, rather than have to fight for a table at a central restaurant. If you want to head into the centre, bus, tram and taxis are cheap. If you only have two or three days in Rome then you might want to choose a hotel right in the centre, but if you have longer, this hotel is a good choice and gives the best of both worlds. The Albani has a range of different rooms, from the standard double to the suites. We stayed in a super quad room on the 5th floor, which was spacious enough for three adults and also had a balcony.

The other drawback was that the staff at the front desk was poor in general. They refused to help us call the airport shuttle, which would cost 31 euros for two people.

The Vatican is miles away (take metro) and the Trevi fountain and the Collesseo are also a good 25 minute walk assuming you know where you are going (again you can take the metro).

Stay with the hard boiled eggs. You do have to walk a ways to find restaurants and food stores but there is a pastry shop with wifi a block away.

In sum, I really don't have anything negative to say about the Albani. I wished it was more centrally located to the historic part of town because it was quite a walk to get back and forth. For this reason only, I probably woudln't stay at the Albani.

My only concerns/comments would be that the resturant wasn't open for dinner when we stayed there and I don't know if this was because it was early March or if it doesn't open. Also there were no tea or coffee facilities in the rooms (again I've heard that this is the norm in Rome) but it would have been a nice touch for a hotel advertising itself as 4*. It is a nice hotel but I would only rate it 3* because of these two things. I would recommend the hotel if you like a bit of a walk and don't want to be in the centre. With no resturant it was about a 20 minute walk to the nearest resturants at night which had people in them!

The room was also spotless and the bathroom fitted to a very high standard.

Don't ask for an iron you'll be told it's dangerous! So either pay the 3 euros, don't take shirts or just buy new ones when you're there. Also ask around for prices on an airport transfer from the hotel.
