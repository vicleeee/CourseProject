We had prepaid for our visit through a special on Orbitz that included breakfast which was terrific as buffet breakfasts in Spanish hotels are very pricey. We had booked a standard room but after I requested a \"quiet room\" we were given a jr. suite at the end of the floor. There was a spacious bath, a sitting room & a very large bedroom with a king bed. And it was quiet, we never saw or heard another person during our entire stay even though there were some large international youth groups staying in the hotel. We really appreciated the terrific air-conditioning which has been a problem in other Spanish hotels. We developed a leak from one of the vents on the second day of a 4 day visit and were immediately transferred to the equivalent room on a higher floor. I suspect this is primarily a business hotel because of its location on Paseo Castellano in the heart of the business district. We picked it because of the location of my daughter's apartment in Las Tablas in the north of Madrid. It is far from the tourist attractions in central Madrid, but the metro stop is next to the hotel and a major city bus stop is across the street. The hotel staff told us about the #27 bus that goes all the way down the Paseo to the museum district (the Prado, the Thyssen, Retiro Park, etc) and we used it several times. The buses take the Metro 10 ticket, which makes using them easy and saves on the fares. If you are dying for American food, there is a McDonalds in the same building. We only indulged in a \"large\" (not by American standards) coke - very expensive at close to 4 euros- just to get ice in a cup! Our only problem was with the unreliable computer connections. WiFi access to the internet is offered throughout the hotel at no charge. We payed 7euros for 24 access to a more complete connection to use a home computer reliably, but the signal dropped constantly. We think the very old laptop was dying so that may have been the problem, not the hotel. So if you don't need to be in the middle of the tourist action this hotel is a good choice.

Last but not least, when we checked out we ended up taking a cab to the airport. We had asked for one to come at 8am, the hotel called one and then we got charged for the distance the cab traveled to the hotel and the few minutes it waited.

The reason that you are forigner gives them the sensation that you probably won't be able to return asking for your stuff.

When I exited the metro I was confronted with the most fabulous sight, Madrid's very own ultramodern twin version of the leaning tower of Pisa, this pair of highly controversial gravity-defying torres. At night what a breathtaking view - everything looked clean, fresh and big! On entering the hotel we were greeted by warm smiles from reception. Checking in was painless, I asked for a room with a view because I wanted to see more of those beautiful towers. My room was on the 7th floor, a corner suite. On entering I was in heaven. Will I leave the hotel room - very hard decision now... The place was immaculate. The bathroom was a great size with a lovely view too, there was a living area with a tv, and two 2-seater sofas and a centre table, the bedroom was to die for so large with large twin beds, flat screen tv, trouser press, chairs, tables, desks and 2 walls of floor to ceiling windows. What a view! It was breathtaking, I slept with the curtains open. The staff were friendly and accomodating, tried some nice cocktails and felt very much at home. I was lucky to get a special price that weekend. I definately need to go back for at least a week as there was too much to see and do in one weekend.

First it is across the street from the major bus station. Second it is built on top of a Mcdonalds. Third it is in the midst of low quality office blocks and rebuilt public housing. Fourth it is a very long ways from anything other than business. You Have To Stay Here because traffic is tough in the morning is its only redeaming virtue. The hotel is cheaply made. Every door in every room on the floor above below and yours slams and you hear it all night. No exceptions. The rooms are nice it is a modern hotel built for the business traveler and yet the Internet is $25 a day $10 for 1 hour. No free internet in the lobby but there is almost no place to sit in the lobby. You can not walk to anywhere unless you want to catch a bus to another city. There are no restaurants around except a Mcdonalds, a bad chinese and a few bars. The restaurant wreaks of smoke and the average entree is $30+. A meal with a salad and a glass of wine runs to $70 and is mediocre. This is a badly made business hotel in a bad location which gets by because like me you have to be in the north part of town for business. If you can stay closer to the city get up a little earlier and take a taxi.

It does have access to the metro right across from the hotel, but you have to change at different juctions and is not ideal for getting around late at night. Be careful not to get ripped off by taxi drivers from the airport, they charged us 40 euros for the taxi, even though it read 20 euro on his meter. The hotel itself is very nice, and the rooms are very clean, didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food.
