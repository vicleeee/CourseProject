If you have not been to Madrid before and do not have a command of Spanish then this is a great hotel for you. It, like many so called 5 start Madrid hotels, have plenty of staff, including the waiters, that have a command of English. Indeed, the music is all American rock. Converselyy, if you want a true Spanish experience in your hotel then perhaps this is not the one for you. The location on the Paseo de Castellana is very good, though not as good as the Westin Palace whcih is near the Prado and Plaza Mayor, but it is near many other museums and if traveling for business it is much closeer to the business center (5 minute cab ride). It is a 7-8 minute cab ride to the nicest shopping areaa or you can get there if you like a bit of a longr walk, but it is walkable. The lobby is nice and the hotel does sport a two Michelin star restaurant (Santceloni). We found the food to be quite good and the hotel seems to put a lot of efffort into its cusine. The staff is very friendly and accomodating and they seem to truly appreciate your business. The most importnat aspect of a hotel is its rooms. We were in room 407, a junior suite. The suite has a king size bed and another room with two twin beds. There was plenty of room, though the closet space is sparse and does not have enough hangers, which annoyed my wife. There were some other nice luxuries like robes, slippers and other amenities like lotions and soaps. The bathroom itself is not large, but sufficient. The room was very clean and the bed comfortable, but trending towards the harder side from a mattress perspective. There is a turn down service as well. There is a small desk that is large enough for most people. My biggest complaint is the internet. The service is free, however, if you do not use it for a few minutes you have to sign in again. In a given day I must have signed in 10-15 times which is just stupid. I was here for a conference and the meeting facilities were also nice and the food served was surprisingly good. Temperature control was a bit of a problem, but only in a minor way. Pricing is not too bad commpared to similar hotels and is significanlty better than the Palace Hotel (Westin). Overall, a very nice stay with a little bit of luxury.

I have no idea how much the breakfast is so cannot say if it is worth it, but seeing as I'm not paying, it was very enjoyable!

I had read on here about the rooms which face internally, so there is no sunlight, and unfortunately I got one of these. It was however a good size, and the bathroom was as big as the bedroom. I opened the bathroom window on arrival, and it opened out onto the nextdoor room's private terrace. It also didn't close properly and I was slightly concerned about safety as someone could easily climb in. I suggested changing rooms but this wasn't really addressed and somebody came to fix the window. The sunlight was not too much of an issue because I was out all day every day, but it wouldn't have been pleasant otherwise and in my opinion that's not a 5* room - it was constantly dark. The bathroom, whilst big, was also not 5* - more like 4*, it felt a bit dated. Overall, the stay was fine. I didn't have much engagement with the staff - I didn't eat at the hotel, didn't use the gym and I literally just came back to sleep. With regards to the environs - I had a walk around the block to find the best of something remotely Spanish that I could! There are a couple of tapas bars if you make the effort to walk around, and Bar Krefky (I think) opposite the hotel next to Starbucks was quite pleasant for lunch - full of locals at least. Turn right out of the hotel and keep walking, there are a couple of bars there, or turn right then first right up that road and there is one there. If you come to Madrid to see the sights and soak up the atmosphere, I wouldn't recommend this place; if you come to Madrid for business, this is fine but there are probably better 5* options around.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "333Julie", "ReviewID": "UR119152898", "Content": "Good value for a late deal.

Within 10-20 minutes you can travel to all the hot spots, even the airport is with a single stop reachable (which saves you a lot of taxi expenses). Busses do also stop just a couple of meters from the hotel and they drive even after midnight. This is Spain, where people like to go out to the streets for food and drinks not earlier than 10-11pm. While in Madrid we used travel cards for the metro and busses. For 3 days we only had to pay 13 euro. A steal compared to other countries (Eg. in my hometown Amsterdam the price for a single ticket costs 2,60 euro). Across the street is a pleasant Starbucks, a good place to start the day with coffee and their usual cookie and pie assortment. A little walk will bring you to the Calle de Serano, Madrid's version of 5th Avenue. For good food please do try the San Miguel Market in the Old Town (metro stop Opera). There you will find nice tapas, lovely wines, paella, steaks, ice cream, cakes, etc...

The rooms are not huge (most European hotel rooms are not very big) but still comfortable. The only two problems with the hotel is the distance from the city center and the water temperature. There is a metro nearby so the distance was not too big of a problem (except for the night of world cup where you could not get a cab if your life depended on it.....but who cares at that point). Taxi is a few euro and the metro is super cheap. The water pressure was fine but would sometimes mysteriously turn hot or cold for a minute (without being touched). That was a little annoying. They did provide nice little touches like turn down service, bathrobes, and great bath supplies (everything from a comb and shaving kit to a toothbrush but not conditioner so bring that along). The maids were also very good (didn't once call to see if we were finally getting out of our room at 4 pm so that they can clean the room). Very clean hotel and didn't hear any noise at all during the night. Great beds too and free internet.

No doorman was stated at the door so we had to took our own luggage to the reception. Half of the hotel was blocked because of the painters. We were very disappointed by this view. The check in was good, but the receptionist did not recognize us as a LHW member. Although we said during reservation that we want to be in a non-smoking room, the receptionist asked us if we wanted to stay in a smoking or non smoking room. This is something you do not ask for when this is mentioned explicitly in the reservation request. As the painters were working the sushi restaurant was closed. We had to eat in the Scottish bar. This is a cigar bar. So we did not want to eat there. We were sitting in the lobby waiting for our food. It took ages before the waiter came to our table. We were eating and drinking in the smell of cigars and paint. This is not a good start for your holiday. The room was good, it was very warm in the room as the air-conditioning was not on when we entered the room. The bathroom is okay, you have to shower in bath. Our room was overlooking the Paseo de la Castellana, so we had some street noise, especially as we had the window open, but this did not bother us. The first night we got 2 complimentary bottles of water, the second and third night no water was provided by the hotel and the water from the tab was with chlorine. In my opinion a 5-star hotel has to provide complimentary bottles of water for the night Breakfast was disappointing. No eggs to order. There was more than enough food, however the quality was not the best. The salmon was a bit brown on the end of the pieces. We had better breakfasts especially as the price for breakfast is not included in the room. All other days we had breakfast outside. I became ill during the stay in the hotel. The reception was very friendly and helpful. They called a doctor, they looked for a pharmacy (open on Sunday) and they helped us very good. Service is excellent. When we asked for a late check out (we want to have a check out at 5 PM) they said that this was not possible but that they could give us a checkout at 4 PM. I do not understand this. In my opinion the hotel is busy with a renovation. The hall has a minimalistic design while the rooms are real hotel rooms. Totally not minimalistic. This is a strange combination.

Room was fantastic; comfortable and spacious, with a large sitting area and a terrific bathroom. The bed was on a slightly raised platform- a half step up from the rest of the room- but a tiny row of lights around the platform, visible only when one got up, prevented tripping and ensured that the raised bed was an endearing quirk. Service was perfect. I had one bag with me, and while I had no doubt that had I given any signal that I needed help it would have been forthcoming immediately, I was not swarmed by bellhops (a pet peeve of mine).

I arrived in my room to find there is no coffee/tea facilities which I felt were poor for a hotel of this standing.

The hotel rooms and common areas are very attractive and well maintained. The hotel is well situated in Madrid\u2019s business area and a reasonable distance from the old town/city center. It is located on a tree-lined side street that serves as part of the Paseo de la Castellana thoroughfare. I was particularly impressed with the overall quality of the hotel, especially given my rate of 106 Euros per night. All of that said, I am not sure a 5-star rating is suitable, but I would agree to a solid 4-star rating. I arrived much earlier than check-in time, but got into my room with no problem. Check-in was fast, easy, and friendly. The room was very clean, odorless, nicely decored, and very comfortable. Most impressive was the option to choose from seven \u2013 yes, seven -- different types of pillows simply by calling guest services. The bathroom was attractive, clean, and well appointed though a bit small. Room amenities included free wireless internet, safe, ironing board, bath robes/slippers, hair dryer, and mini-bar. The bed was very comfortable. Downsides: The climate control in the room did not work and the room was hot. Fortunately, the temperature was about 9C/48F and I could open a window to cool it down. There was utterly no view whatever. The only clock in the room was on the tv, but went off when the tv was off. Someone\u2019s fingernail clipping was in the sink. The bathroom door was glass with an etched pattern, but it was quite easy to look through the non-etched glass pattern and get a pretty full view of the bathroom. Predictably, food prices were preposterous (20 Euros for a burger, 5 for a small Coke), but if you are a weary traveler with no time to prowl around looking for food, there are few options close by. On check out, my room had been charged with several unidentified mini-bar items, though I had used nothing and touched nothing. They made good on it with no argument, though. I\u2019m a little surprised that other reviewers raved so much about the breakfast buffet. It was included with the room cost and was okay, but sub-par in variety and quality compared to most of my other Euro hotel breakfast experiences. I certainly did not think it was bad but not great either. I don\u2019t know how the Spanish do it, but their coffee is just the best. This is a great hotel in a convenient part of Madrid.

The rooms are not sound proof at all, and you can hear crystal clear everything some else is saying on the hallway or in the rooms next to yours! When somebody else is taking a shower in the next room, you know it. You can really try hard to find another 5 star hotel without sound proof rooms. Also, the hotel does not have a swimming pool, bell boy, etc. The reception area is similar to a 3 star hotel (not even 4), and during the night they close the front door (due to the fact that there is only one person from the staff in the entire hotel), and you need to ring to get into the hotel. The breakfast is ok, but you could expect from a 5 star hotel to have an egg corner, or prepare your scrambled eggs on the spot with the ingredients you like. Bad luck, Hesperia does not have this, and the only eggs you can find are plain scrambled eggs prepared before in a big tray. I am not saying that it is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.

Because I had such an attractive rate for the rooms owing to an online offer, it feels almost wrong to complain about anything, but I want to paint a clear picture of what the hotel is and isn't for those considering it. Firstly, the service is fantastic. We arrived several hours in advance of our check in and they happily gave us one of our rooms which was ready to be occupied. Additionally, they cheerfully accommodated our flight schedule and allowed for a late check out. The staff at the reception, in the lobby and at the door was without exception attentive, informative an genuinely friendly. The lobby is pleasant if not a little dated in it's design concepts. At the rear of the reception area there is a very inviting patio dining area which I sadly skipped as it seemed better suited to business people than the children I was traveling with. The two rooms I had were slightly different from one another. They were both oriented toward the interior (i.e, not the street) which meant they were slightly dark yet quiet which I assumed (correctly) would make for better sleep than a sunny room facing Castellana. One room was fairly small in size and had two twin beds; this was a very cramped space and the darker and sadder of the two rooms. The second room had an expansive bedroom area with a queen bed. While it faced a wall in the courtyard, the bathroom window looked out on to an open space and subsequently had plenty of natural light. So be ready because as I learned, the rooms in the same category can vary dramatically in terms of size and light. Because I was both tired and humbled by my insane online rate, I didn't try to jockey for a better room. I just let it be, which I think is basically all you can do in Spain most of the time. It is what it is. The rooms were comfortable, but not perfect. If you are someone who is amused by good design, the look of these rooms will not grab you. The interior is \"generic hotel\" with it's cranberry, dark wood and brass. Banal but comfortable. The one super negative of the interiors concerned the desk chair in my larger room had a rather unfortunate stain on the seat. Nothing takes a girl out of basking in luxury like seeing yucky stains. The good news is that the bathrooms were very nice in both rooms with natural stone, a large bathtub and nice towels and robes. In fact, the bathroom was the only component of the room that met the standards of a 5 star hotel that is part of the Leading Hotels of the World network. The only trouble in this area is the slight suggestion of mold growing on the corners of the tub where tile meets porcelain. That made for a less than perfect bath experience. In the final analysis, I think this is a fantastic hotel to stay in if you are able to procure a great rate. I might not set out to book this hotel as a destination because there are probably other hotels in Madrid in this category that would provide a more luxurious stay overall.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cGood choice but not central\u201d", "Author": "BenBagBag", "ReviewID": "UR35852376", "Content": "Off the central groove but great value and 100 metres from the metro, which will take you anywhere.

Very out of fashion decor, in a sort of 80's USA corporate luxury way, with lots of fake gold, carved wood and heavy textiles, a bit worn off and in need of maintenance, and completely out of touch with the modern, though banal, mid 90's building and its lobby's attempt at an oriental look. We had problems with the air conditioning, which made a very disturbing noise every now and then for the whole night. The linens were a bit worn off and the mattress was not very firm. The room faced an inner courtyard and had almost no natural light. It felt rather confined. The bathroom was very old fashioned, with lots of brass railings, brown and beije marble with a few cracks here and and needing some heavy scrubbing, tiny bathtub, no bidet, an annoying glass door, and a cracked window. It all looked rather dated and lacking in maintenance. Service was fine though, the staff was friendly and took our comments with attention and concern.

Overall a good experience, despite a few minues. Please see below what I think is a balanced a fair review: The positives: - Guest services desk completely organized the AVE high speed train tickets from madrid to seville, including getting the paper tickets delivered. - Room had fresh fruit and snacks daily - Excellent breakfast (unusual for Madrid I'm told) and made to order things like Mango puree or waffels included in buffet price - 30 sec walk to the Metro station - Weight and fitness room has some good offerings - Choices of pillows nice - Extremely quiet. I hardly saw anyone there. Maid service was polite. - Staff very helpful at getting you cabs and making sure the driver knew where you wanted to go. The negatives: - First time I called guest services to book a flamenco show, I was told I should call back and ask the person again at the desk tomorrow, as the show is closed sundays (why couldn't the person I just explained everything to write a note for their colleague on Sunday?) - the bathroom was poorly light, with 4 recessed lights, (none over toliet and bath. On several occassions there was some kind of a short, and 3 of the 4 lights went out. The front desk said someone would fix it (and did but only temporarily) - The Guest services told us that the train tickets to Toledo could be picked up on the spot at the station. however when we got there we experienced a Mob of people, and were told to get in a que where you take a number..... to make a long story short we missed the train. No one seems to understand how this train system works for the short serve trains. recommend asking the Guest services people to procure these tickets for you as well. - I was under the impression the hotel had a spa.... but in fact they do not. (I happen to call from my cell phone while I was out one day, and asked the front desk if I could make a spa appt and was told \"we don-t have a spa....\" What they do have in the fitness room is a bare minimum list of spa services, which I guess they outsource from another place. In any case it is not advertised v much (e.g. not even a spa menu in the room.) so in short, overall a good experience - as I figure the negatives (train incident and lighting) were probably flukes.

Overall if you stay at this hotel and book a rate with no breakfest incl. you will have a nice stay.", "Date": "October 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely come back!\u201d", "Author": "ansalm", "ReviewID": "UR3648166", "Content": "My husband and I went to Madrid to celebrate my birthday and we chose this hotel because we wanted a nicer hotel than what we could get for the same price in the center, and it turned out to be a very nice stay. It is located in a more residential/business area of madrid, but there are still very nice restaurants not far from the hotel where we could go for breakfast (EUR 25 pp at the buffet was a bit steep) or out at night since its located in one of the nicest residential neighborhoods. The fact that is was a bit far from the center was not a problem at all, there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel which takes you directly to the center (15 min direct ride to the Puerta del Sol), and a metro stop half a block away where you can easily get to the airport (changing once). And although the room we got was a bit small (and had an inside view) there were very nice amenities that made up for it: fruit basket when you arrive (only the first day), great bathroom and toiletries, the most luscious bathrobe, and even a pillow menu! The restaurants at the hotel (2) are good but a bit expensive, and there is one that has 1 michelin star. went to the other one and had the best paella-type thing ever!! all in all, very nice hotel a bit far from tourist attractions but very easy to get from here to any place and well worth it for the price we got!", "Date": "July 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisbon, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cA 5 star with to much noise during the night\u201d", "Author": "ordep", "ReviewID": "UR3608182", "Content": "When I arrived they had the garage full.

The hotel itself is very nice and the location is good. Rooms can be had from about 160 Euro, try to get a room not facing the back. Considering this hotel is part of the prestige Leading Hotels of the World group, many aspects of my stay were surprising. Rooms are quite noise, thin walls let you know exactly what is going on in neighboring rooms as well as above and below you. The promised newspaper in the morning did not arrive on either of my two mornings. One night they forgot the turn down service and there were lots of other little service problems which added up to an overall less than satisfying stay. Food in the main restaurant was OK, not great but front desk and front door service was good. They also reacted very positively to the negative feedback I shared with them. Having read that the hotel picks their employees based on acting ability and other unconventional hiring techniques, they might want to review this practice...

Stayed on two seperate ocassions for a total of 8 nights. For business, it is ideally located in the Paseo de las Castellana. If you are travelling for tourism, you are not too far either, since Madrid's center is ver compact. This is one of the safest districts to stay in Madrid, as the Gran Via and Plaza de Espana areas are plagued with pick-pocketers and prostitution. Rooms are brand-spanking new and funcitonal, although like in most Madrid hotels, don't come here looking for a view, since most rooms face a courtyard that is not much to speak about. Bulgari toiletries provided, and the service is very good (room service, valets, housekeeping, concierge), as the hotel is one of the Leading Hotels of the World group, an association which has rigorous standards as far as service. The lobby is impressive for a Madrid hotel, yet the traffic flow in and out of the hotel is like that of a boutique hotel. Restaurant is overpriced and not great, but there are plenty of good restaurants and cafes in the area. I would venture to say that this is the best hotel in Madrid and probably will be for a couple of years.", "Date": "July 10, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hesperia Madrid", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d229686-Reviews-Hesperia_Madrid-Madrid.html", "Price": "$170 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Paseo de la Castellana 57</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28046</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "229686", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/8c/c5/c2/lobby.jpg"}}
