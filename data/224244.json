On the weekend we stayed there, the traffic lights on U.S. 1 are timed quite nicely for your drive getting to and from downtown. The check-in process was a breeze. Our room on the 4th floor was very nice, clean, and very comfortable. We love staying at Hamptons because the beds are so comfortable, and this particular Hampton was no exception. Breakfast was excellent... lots of good foods (hot and cold) to choose from: cheese omelets, make-your-own Belgian waffles, sausage, and then of course fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, and so on. (The cheese omelets were amazing!) We loved the breakfast area because you could sit inside or outside... outside being particularly on a sunny Florida morning. This Hampton has an outdoor pool and hot tub, and we were able to take advantage of the hot tub one evening. Very nice pool area, although the main pool was a bit too chilly for us to use that night.

There were an overwhelming number of positives for this hotel. Most of all and first of all, the staff were professional friendly, and eager to ensure our stay was a pleasant experience. The room and common areas were clean, and there was no chemical odor from cleaners or disinfectants. The beds were fairly comfortable, even the fold-out couch I slept on. Despite a full hotel, all the guests were quiet, and we never had a problem with noise or really any sounds from other guests. Problems were few... we were on the 4th floor and the wireless internet service was spotty. The connection dropped almost as soon as it was made. The staff tried to help but it may have been a problem with our location in the building. Had this been a business trip, I would have requested a room closer to the lobby for better wireless service. Another thing was a misreporting of available space by the Hampton Inn website. Hamptonnn.hilton.com consistently told us that for the few nights we were there, the hotel had at least one nonsmoking room with two doubles available, when in fact the hotel had no such rooms open. We accepted a room with a king bed and a fold-out sofa. The staff were very apologetic about the repeated error, and I don't fault them at all - it's clearly a problem with Hampton/Hilton's online reservation system. One last positive from a very negative situation we had. My wife had a very sudden and very unexpected medical emergency at 345am the last night of our stay there. After I ensured she was stable, I phoned the front desk in a half-panic. Even at that late hour, the phone was answered within two rings and the man who answered was very alert, he listened carefully, got my request right the first time, stayed calm, and arranged for Miami Fire and Rescue to call me - which they did within the next 60 seconds. In another ten minutes, the EMS crew was in our room and in short order my wife was taken to nearby Baptist Hospital, which for us was an excellent choice. (My wife is fine now, thank the Lord.) During all this, the Hampton staff I dealt with were helpful and concerned. Even with shift changes, every staff person I dealt with was up to speed on what was going on with us, and they worked with me for the late checkout time I needed later that day. Of course we'd rather have spent our last night in Miami at the Dadeland Hampton Inn than at the $1,000-plus a night hospital room we ended up in, but for this Hampton's great service and their professional help in a frightening time, we were most grateful.", "Date": "July 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poole, UK", "Title": "\u201cVery nice and good value\u201d", "Author": "swivellingmonk", "ReviewID": "UR16024038", "Content": "Overall an excellent choice for a few days in Miami.

Wasn't sure if it was the remote control, but wasn't really interested much either. The cleaning staff was very good. I like the coziness of this Hampton.
