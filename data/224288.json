Pros: Great hotel if you are going to the races, right next door. I could see the cars running the track from my window.

Plenty of outlets to plug in computer and cell phones. Heat/air controlled by a wall thermostat so the room was a constant temperature. The hotel overall is very inviting and clean. There is a separate bar that is open after 5pm except for Sundays, I didn't venture in there. Other than that...it is pretty much your normal hilton garden inn. There is an Olive Garden next door and plenty of restaurants within a short drive. Very convenient to the airport (also has a free shuttle). Cons: The bathtub had been resurfaced in the past and the \"painted\" layer was peeling off..very unappealing and had to pick pieces out of the tub before I showered. There were also a few hairs in the tub (gross).

The overall area is a fairly good area and appears to be safe. The hotel exterior is clean and appealing. The interior lobby is nicely decorated and the kitchen/dining are clean.

The room was excellent; clean clean clean, the bed was a little hard at first but after a careful look at the mattress it has a dial on the side and you can adjust the bed to your comfort. That problem was solved with a dial. Pillows were okay. The room was a suite and was \"extremely\" nice. Equip with a fridge, microwave, sink and etc. The room was facing the front of the hotel overlooking the pool and on the top floor- corner room. It was quiet and peaceful no kidding. Regarding the maids they was nice and cleaned the room as if it was as if walked in the first day. Maids working in hall didn't hear them, no yelling and conversing in the halls. No bumping and hitting walls when cleaning. Just In case there was a do not disturb sign on the door. The breakfast was good and the selection was okay.

I arrived around 9:30pm and was greeted with a smile. Check in was fast and I was soon on my way to my King Junior Suite (RM 527). I booked the Bed and Breakfast Package since it was only $5.00 more than the room only. I read other reviews about the front desk staff being unhelpful. I found them extremely helpful. In fact one evening I needed to carry in some heavy boxes and the luggage carts were all in use. One of the ladies at the desk offered to help me and she carried in a box from my car. They were also very helpful providing directions and restaurant suggestions. They definitely went above and beyone The room was large with a TV in the bedroom area and in the Living room area. The bathroom was basic, but spotless and there were plenty of towels. Everything in the room was in working order and Housekeeping made up the room prior to noon each day. The bed was super comfortable - soft sheets and you can adjust the firmness on the mattress. Although the airport is close to the airport terminal and the busy International Speedway Blvd. the room was absolutely quiet. I ate the cooked to order eggs every morning. The cooks and servers were all very pleasant and service was prompt and the eggs were cooked exactly as I like them. I would recommend buying the bed and breakfast since the cost of the buffet is $9.95 per person. The package is a much better deal. The best thing about the hotel was the free in room WIFI and the Business Center off the lobby. The Business Center had a combo fax/copy machine and there was no charge for faxing or making copies. The computers in the business center were fast and there were no problems printing from them. There was no additonal charge for printing. The pool looked inviting, but I had no time for relaxation on this trip and a cold front came through. Zip check out made leaving the hotel a breeze. I just dropped off the keycards at the desk. Having the pantry available by the front desk was also a great convenience. It was nice that you could also buy beer and wine there too. I did not use the bar area, but it looked nice and there were people there every evening.

After that , you know its a crapshoot, still, in this day and age of service ' whenever' and 'whatever'. .. Well, from the first time I connected to the hotel via the Delta helpline for messed-up travelers it was clear we would have a good experience. Room was reasonably priced, lobby was well appointed; by the time we got to the hotel via free shuttle from the airport that came immediately after we called, it was too late for room service. The lobby pantry / provisions area had food, drink and even beer available for purchase to microwave in your room or tide us over til breakfast. Yes it was kind of pricy but we just chose wisely and was grateful for the convenience. The room itself was just a 2 queen but had nice duvets, great pillows and was quiet. Maybe being near the airport and not on the spring-break beach was a factor, I dont know, I was just really thankful for the serenity. The breakfast was not included in our room rate, but cost only $8-something for adults and $4-something for children under 12. I couldn't have eaten anywhere in town for that price, for the selection and quality ( and quantity ) of food on offer. Eggs cooked to order, nice sausage, bacon, french toast, pancakes, waffles, cereals, juices pastry fruit etc etc etc . Staff was kind and attentive throughout our stay ...but the kitchen chefs/cooks really impressed me. They didnt act like they were just cooking food and slinging hash - they wanted to make sure what you ordered met your expectations, was enough or not too much. The breakfast experience really topped off a great stay after a crummy travel day. Desk staff made sure we were comfortable and offered some extra assistance on a nighttime lost-luggage-return run. A swim in the morning and a quick look in the gym found more tidy cleanliness and care for the facility. Our kudos to the team, and we'll consider Daytona Beach for a non-accidental trip in the future in order to enjoy this hotel.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin ireland", "Title": "\u201cA great hotel\u201d", "Author": "patandfiona", "ReviewID": "UR22522626", "Content": "Spent two nights here in November.

It was absolutely the cleanest hotel we've ever stayed in. The room was beautiful and extremely quiet- there was almost no external noise heard. The staff could not have been nicer or more accomodating. They offer the best breakfast buffet we've ever seen and at a price you would expect at a Denny's. There was a chef who would cook your eggs/omelettes to order and there was anything imaginable you could think of in addition. Computers are available for guests to use and the hotel is conveniently located near the Speedway, Airport, Volusia Mall, and many restaurants. We will absolutely stay here again and highly recommend it.

I chose this hotel after searching the internet for weeks to find an acceptable place to stay. But what we got was more than just acceptable...... It was fantastic! After having a 3 hour drive and arriving late at the hotel (i rang and notified them on the way) the hotel staff at reception were fast, efficient, polite and a pleasure to deal with. Then more excellence from the room..... It was very clean with a large tv, comfortable beds a large floor space and bathroom all in very good condition. After a good nights sleep we thought we'd try out the breakfast and again not a problem. The menu of the hotel restaurant had enough on it to keep us happy the whole trip! (sundays its closed) We tried nearly everything on the menu which was very well cooked and presented (the gulf grouper was my personal favorite) This hotel is a must if you want to stay in the daytona area....
