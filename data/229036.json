The staff were fantastic, as other reviewers have said, far exceeded my expectations, they were so helpful and ready to assist with everything. Made my mother and I feel really comfortable and welcome. The decor is very lovely and the location opposite the Borghese gardens is just delightful. Fantastic spot for a pre-dinner cocktail on the Mirabelle terrace overlooking the city of Rome and the Vatican...just stunning. Location is good for access around the city and compared to other hotels, it was worth the money. One tiny irritation was the fact there was just one single electrical socket in the room, which I had to crawl under a desk to reach to plug my various eletrical items in and out. But the rest of the hotel and stay more than compensated for this.

The check in went smoothly and we were shown to our room straight away by the receptionist, Anastasia who was very pleasant and polite. She showed us round the suite and then left us to enjoy the complimentary bottle of shiraz and nibbles that had been left to welcome us. We had chosen the junior suite with a terrace and were not disappointed. The bedroom and lounge area were a good size, very grand with traditional Italian style decor and heavy drapes, which were perfect for a good night's sleep! The bed was comfortable with quality bed linen which was turned down every evening. We had 2 bathrooms to choose from with the main having a jacuzzi bath, power shower and jack and jill sinks. Robes and (very comfy) slippers were also provided along with the usual array of toiletries. Every room along the length of the suite had french windows leading onto the terrace and it was nice to lie in bed in the morning with the windows open letting the gentle breezy sunshine in! The room was kept spotlessly clean and tended to in the morning and during the evening turn down and we looked forward to returning to the suite every evening after a busy day of sightseeing, eating and drinking gorgeous food and wine. There was lots of choice for breakfast including, eggs (scrambled and boiled), bacon, Italian sausage, cheese, ham, fruit, bread, jam, tea and coffee. The service was professional but polite. The breakfast room has a fantastic view of Rome and we could see the dome of St Peters in the distance which was spectacular when the sun was shining. We didn't try the Mirabelle restaurant but that's simply because we like the traditional little Italian restaurants but we did have a look and it was beautiful with a good a la carte menu. On our last day, we returned to the room late afternoon for a power nap before getting ready to head back out for an evening meal and a stroll. When we woke, we went into the lounge area to find a bottle of Martini Asti Spumante on ice with some bowls of nibbles along with a card wishing me a happy Birthday which was a lovely surprise (luckily, we had forgotten to put the 'do not disturb' sign on). I guess they either knew it was my birthday from the passport or perhaps the housekeeping staff that tended to our room that day saw my birthday cards. Either way, it was a nice touch! The hotel is well placed for walking to all of the attractions. It's a short walk from the Spanish Steps and within walking distance to all of the main sights. Another reviewer mentioned they had to get taxis everywhere but I think that's either personal preference or down to one's own general health and fitness. We do like to walk because seeing the beauty of the city on foot is what it's all about for us and we walked our socks off every day and loved it! We normally go for contemporary style hotels (we stayed at the St George last time but had a silver Hot Diamonds bangle go missing along with one of my tops which was a disappointing end to an otherwise fantastic break) but decided we would try something completely different this time and we are glad we did. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Splendide Royal. It IS expensive however, we did not feel ripped off at all and would highly recommend to anybody wanting a bit of elegance, splendor and a professional, unobtrusive service.

The experience overall was absolutely perfect. The hotel offers an effective balance between traditional Italian hospitality and world-class luxury standards. Arranging our stay here within only a month of travel was very easy and organized. We booked transfers from the Fiumicino airport, an evening at their Mirabelle restaurant (see my other review), breakfasts and a Junior Suite effortlessly, during an otherwise busy period. As if this would suggest their fantastic service, upon arrival at the hotel, the reception assisted with every arrangement and double-checked reservations. Since they were available, I was even shown around the hotel suites upon request, which are truly phenomenal. After settling into our room, the concierge offered a knowledgable service on attractions and dining in Rome, booking us a table at a few restaurants during our spend including Ad Hoc (see my other review). The view from our room (situated next to the Presidential Suite) was exceptional, looking over the entirety of Rome across the Villa Borghese and Vatican City in the distance. We had a small veranda to sit and relax whilst basking in the Italian heat wave at this time, yet the air conditioning in the room was superb keeping our nights' sleep at a more comfortable temperature. Another wonderful surprise was that Hotel Splendide Royal is connected with the top-end Parco dei Principi in Rome, where we had access to their 7* Prince Spa. We've never experienced anything quite like it; the spa was an incredible relief from the hot weather at the end of an eventful day. It's difficult to sum-up just how fantastic our visit to Rome and stay at the Hotel Splendide Royal was. Everything seemed to fit together harmoniously, so much so that we in fact extended our initial 3 nights' stay to 5. Needless to say, the hotel reception even rearranged flights and transfers to suit. The overall atmosphere in this hotel is not pretentious, and truly satisfies your desire for a luxurious Roman experience.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cSplendide service, not so splendide hotel\u201d", "Author": "NYJanet", "ReviewID": "UR125424275", "Content": "I'll start out with the good: The staff was excellent.

I give the service 5 stars and a huge thank you for being so fantastic. Room Size: I was pretty impressed. Everyone always talks about how small the hotel rooms are in Italy, but I thought our room was average. And now for the not so good... Decor: As far as the hotel itself it was extremely ornate and old; definitely not my style but I thought maybe it would be charming to stay in a hotel like that in Rome. Not so much. The decor was weird; claw footed mustard sofas and think burgundy curtains, over the top chandeliers. The walls looked like they could use a fresh coat of paint. Maybe some people like that, but the decor was lost on me. Pillows: HORRIBLE. I always roll my eyes at the reviews where people discuss the linens or things like that, but I have to say these pillows were the worst. Location: It certainly didn't seem as convenient as everyone else is saying in their reviews. My husband and I took a cab pretty much everywhere. And we're New Yorkers who are used to walking a lot.

Didn't know exactly what to expect as this was not only the first time staying at this hotel but also our first time in Rome. I searched and searched all possible web sites for choices of hotels with their reviews for weeks before choosing Splendide. Going through the many reviews and photos of all that was available in the 5 Star Range as well as the minimum feedback by a customer being 4.25 or 4.5 out of 5. I was torn by going with a hotel that I have used before in other travels, like the St Regis, but I'm very much happy with my choosing of this boutique hotel, Hotel Splendide Royal. The Staff are amazing. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by a fantastic young lady, Anastasia at the front desk. She greeted us with great warmth and quickness to get us into our room. She also gave us great detailed information on how to approach our sightseeing and entertainment with a full map, circling areas of interest, and travel time by foot or taxi. As soon as we walked into the room, we were greeted by the cheerful bellhop who brought our luggage in and placed them carefully spread through the room as we had a few heavy suitcases with us. He too was attempting to be quite informative with anything that we needed or would need to make our stay more enjoyable and impactful. As soon as we started to unpack, a bottle of champagne was sent to our room by the front desk just because they became aware of my fiance and I's recent engagement when we checked in. The rest of the staff, many that we came across during our stay, were too all as gracious and hospitable making sure everything was perfect for us. The front desk staff are all very informative and willing to help. One gentleman, forget his name, behind the front desk, walked away from his duties to quickly help take pictures of us in front of the hotel and in the lobby without us even asking him to. The room was nice, nothing to say \"oh my god\", but we stayed in the biggest superior room. Clearly our intentions for being in Rome wasn't to spend all of our money and time in a luxury suite since we knew that the most time in the room will be spent while we were sleeping at night. But if funds is not an issue, then you should definitely get a suite just to have more room and a better view. Our room had no view, but was extremely quite and private. Room size was fit for a king bed, plenty of room to walk around by two people with suitcases all over, a great sized bathroom with tub, and a walk in closet with a safe. The bed, pillows, and sheets were comfortable. And the maids did their best to keep the room clean every time you went in and out or as you wished. The breakfast on the 6th floor, TERRACE LA LIMONAIA, is a must. Make sure you get it included with you room. It was such a treat to start the day with amazing eggs, assorted cheeses, the ricotta is unbelievable, fresh fruits and juices, and caffe with a spectacular view including the Vatican. This is the best way to start off a long day of walking and sightseeing. The restaurant on the 7th floor, MIRABELLE, is too a great restaurant with fantastic views. A quiet romantic restaurant. But if you are looking for a crowd and scene, its not that kind of a place. The terrace at Mirabelle for drinks and Cigars is perfect for the view before going to dinner someplace else if you want a livelier scene. We had breakfast every morning at the hotel, but had lunch and dinner at other places in Rome. The Location of the hotel was great for us. Close to the Spanish steps, about a 10 minute casual walk. We actually walked everywhere from the hotel as that is what being in Rome is all about. So be prepared according to season and comfort. To the Colosseum took about a 30 minute walk, but you see so much along your walks that the time doesn't matter.The only time we took taxis is at night when we went out to formal dinners dressed accordingly, or when it rained, as the streets get quite slippery to walk on. We had a car service/ driver to and from the airport which I recommend. I highly recommend Hotel Splendide Royal as I will stay there again when im next back in Rome. Its is not a lower \"cheaper\" rate hotel, but for the rate that you spend at this hotel, it is the best in comparioson. Rome is not cheap by any means, so be prepared to spend money. And for the tours, we used a personal guide and not a group guide. Again, not cheap but the ideal way to see Rome and its attractions as you learn and know what Rome was.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location\u201d", "Author": "Suse R", "ReviewID": "UR123488231", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for three nights in January 2012.

On arrival we were greeted at the airport by our chauffeur with no trouble and after an unscheduled guided tour of Rome by our driver arrived at the hotel which is located at the northern end of town. This is an excellent location for exploring and the hotel makes the most of its outlook over the Villa Borghese. The hotel is decadent (in a very traditional Italian way) in its decor and the reception and greeting rooms are impressive. We were placed on the 6th floor in a room with a beautiful bathroom (huge bath!) and a lovely balcony overlooking the Villa Borghese and the Vatican. Even before our bags were dropped off the champagne on ice had arrived and we enjoyed it watching the sun set over St Peter's Basilica with some chocolates (also complimentary) and the 24 red roses which I had always thought would be a complete waste of time, but as this was our honeymoon and they looked so spectacular I was actually delighted to have. The room was again, traditionally decorated, but I loved this as it was totally in keeping with the rest of the hotel and suited the fact you are in Rome. Also included in our package was breakfast (a must because otherwise it would have cost EUR35 each - something that caught out many other guests we noticed) and a meal in the Mirabelle restaurant which we booked for our last night. This was the most wonderful experience. I have eaten at quite a few Michelin star places before, but this was right up there and the most surprising thing was the portion sizes - they were huge!! The food itself is expensive if you haven't got the meal included in a package (we calculated that our total meal including wine would have cost us EUR400+) and the hotel could make this a bit clearer to its guests. While we were seated, a couple of Americans sat down clearly expecting it to be a simple hotel restaurant and couldn't understand why there were being asked to pay EUR50 for a starter. They left without ordering. The menu is displayed in the reception however so we felt a little like this was their own fault as well. On checkout were were charged extra for the airport transfer which was included in our package, but this was quickly rectified with little hassle and no complaint and we left after 4 nights feeling that this was one of the best places we have stayed in Europe.

In so doing I chose this hotel having read many favourable reviews on Tripadvisor and also because, having been disappointed with our stay at Hassler last summer, we wanted to explore a better hotel. We booked a junior suite with a Borgehse Park view but without balcony. The room allocated to us was quite spacious and furnished well having a large balcony with a couple of reclining chairs. They sort of leveled up to a better room very kindly without mentioning it. The lounges are gorgeously decorated and furnished in a Baroque style. Lifts and corridors are rather small and narrow but sufficient for a small number of guests they accommodate. Staff at reception were efficient and kind appearing to be always sincerely ready to help guests. As my wife\u2019s suitcase had been missed at the airport a concierge kindly searched for it earnestly through Alitalia\u2019s lost property desk which had appeared to us very inefficient and untrustworthy ( we got it back two days after we returned home ) We had booked a table at Mirabelle, a Michelin starred restaurant in this hotel for dinner for which she thought she had no appropriate dress and shoes. The concierge talked to Restaurant Manager describing what she wore and persuaded him to accept her as she appeared. However she felt so sad and miserable that we even thought of cancelling the dinner. Good gracious me, when I opened my suitcase I found a shopping bag in which a new dress she bought at Villa D\u2019Este was contained and further found her pair of dress shoes, too! So we could have cheerfully a good dinner. Mirabelle was a very good restaurant beautifully decorated looking out nicely to the city and Borgehse Park. Hassler had a similar or even better location ( Michelin starred also ) but Mirabelle provided much better ambience and cuisine. First a manager like man greeted us and asked which table we would like inside or outside. My wife asked for an inside table and then he said, \u201cWe would give you a table very close to the balcony still with a good view\u201d. Quite a few waiters served us very smartly creating good atmosphere for us. The dishes were, like Japanese summer style, all made of decorated glasses. As one of them was so beautifully designed that its surface was uneven and dressing flowed over the plate and then the table on to my trousers. Several waiters came and offered to change the plate but, as it could spoil the food, I asked a folded napkin to insert between the corner of the plate and the table. A lot of applaud came from them, saying how clever I was. It did not damage our cheerful mind at all but back home I discovered that my trousers had uselessly carried a couple of big stains even after cleaning.

Even the ultra-luxe spa was open for Splendide guests and while I did not partake on the indoor spa, it was extremely impressive to view. I almost cried when I saw my room, it was so elegant! Beautiful marble bathroom, Etro bath and shower products, and they even give a hand-written card as part of their turndown service that advised as to the next day's weather!

I will definitely stay there again, and would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to others. One last note...my second week suite was only available until the second to last night of my stay, but I had thought that I may stay near the airport as I had a 5:00 AM flight .When the time came to decide that, there was no way I was going to leave this hotel for some ugly airport hotel, and I had an all day tour starting at 6:30 am - 8:00 PM, so I knew I would need some downtime after that.

The hotel is in a fantastic location just minutes from the top of the Spanish steps and across the road from the beautiful Borghese park. Check in was efficient and friendly with immediate suggestions as to which attractions to visit (we arrived on a bank holiday and some were shut), and a map provided. We had two interconneting deluxe rooms on the fifth floor with park view. The rooms are air conditioned and the decor sumptuous. Internet connection is available however my husband was constantly frustrated with regard to lack of speed and the loss of connection which was always rectified swiftly. We ate in Mirabelle (very pricey and we have eaten at a number of similar restaurants!) the views are worth the cost. We sat on the terrace and watched the sunset over Rome - magical. I had a hot foie gras with peaches to begin which was beautifully cooked however the two textures were too similar. Next I had the seabass which was seasoned and cooked to perfection. We all felt that for a Michelin starred restaurant the food was good, however lacked the surprises and depth of flavours we have experienced before. We also ate at Pierluigi a great seafood restaurant (but again potentially expensive \u00a3100 for a sea bream between three!). The pasta with lobster was beautiful as was the tartare of tuna to begin. We also ate at Ad Hoc our favourite of our dining experiences providing a number of options including a handful of degustation menus. We chose the truffle degustation with wine included for two at 110 euros and 80 without for our daughter. You need to pace yourself! After a lovely egg plant amuse bouche we had \"tasters\" of eggs with black truffle, beef carpaccio with black truffle, a stuffed pumpkin flower, and endive all delicious but fair size portions. Next the pasta tasters of ravioli with a ragout of rabbit with truffle of course and pasta carbonara both gorgeous. Next a fillet of tuscany beef cooked medium rare with truffle sauce and mashed potatoes. Desserts were tiramasu, creme brulee and apple strudel. Petit fours followed. All the courses were served with divine wines which were perfect matches. It was hot though and the restaurant has no air conditioning. Staff were fantastic we rolled into our taxi to take us back to our hotel! On the subject of the hotel again, check out the spa at its sister hotel it is fantastic! We spent our last afternoon there as we had seen all we wanted to. Only criticism of the Splendide is the buffet breakfast which I feel is inadequate in choice for a hotel of its calibre.

We took a Superior room, in fact they are not very large (but I realized that in the historic center of Rome you can't expect very large rooms) and have internal view. However, the space of the room is more than enough to feel comfortable, the bathroom is spacious, and the room and the bathroom are both very comfortable and clean. Beds are comfortable and linens are fresh and pleasant. Unfortunately there is not enough light from the windows in the room (perhaps the other categories are brighter), but the view from the room was not a priority for us because, thanks to the location, the most beautiful part of Rome is just around the corner! The hotel is beautiful, with tapestry on the walls of the room (I had never seen it before, probably for the soundproofing as well as for the decoration), but I guess not everyone could appreciate it because it is an old-fashioned hotel and red and yellow coloured. We liked it a lot because it is just like the \"style\" of that area of Rome. But, above all, the real difference was made by the staff! In particular, the Reception has given us so much support to enjoy the city in the best ways (do not miss the Galleria Borghese, just next to them) and every time we approached the reception desk and ask for something there was always a nice greeting smile ready to answer. The restaurants they recommended were very good and the advices on how to organize our journey were perfect. It's nice to meet people so happy to talk about their city and the beauties which are to be discovered. The breakfast would be ok: it's rich and of quality, but the prices are too high and most of the choices are \"a la carte\", not included in the Buffet. The breakfast room is extremely nice with a spectacular view, but perhaps a little too hot ... well, far too hot. We also had a look at the restaurant: a wonderful place! (But we did not eat there, so \"no comment\" on the quality). Don't miss the SPA and the swimming pool area. After 2 days of tourism we definitely needed a little relax ... They are re not inside the hotel but in another hotel close enough to the Splendid. We went on foot (less than 20 minutes through the park of Villa Borghese, I highly recommend this kind of walk) and went back by taxi (10 Euros) but we were told that there was also the possibility of a lift arranged from the hotel (I think), using their shuttle. However as we arrived at the SPA we found it much more beautiful than we thought: new and beautiful. Well, breakfast apart (lower prices and comfortable temperature would be highly appreciated!), since you can find it much cheaper in the many bars just round the corner, we are absolutely satisfied and we went back home happy.

We stayed four nights in early August as part of our wedding anniversary. We'd just traveled from Florence where we stayed at another property defined as 5 star. Positives: - The room itself, which was a Jr. Suite with Terrace was a nice size. - The shower was great. - The concierge named Jonathan was helpful - The location was decent Negatives - The \"terrace\" on the Jr. Suite with Terrace was probably 6' x 4'. After I returned today, I did read the fine print where it indicates that one of these suites has a much smaller \"terrace\". Wish I'd been given an option, as I was looking forward to this part of the room. - The A/C was not functioning properly to begin with (not because windows or doors were open, which is kind of a cool feature to their system). This was eventually corrected. - My wife, not unlike a previous reviewer, likes additional pillows. We requested additional pillows on our way out the first evening and were told they would be brought up prior to our return. They were not and we called again and eventually they were brought up. - Internet - it's a 50/50 proposition that it will work for you. More on that further below. - The toilet in the bath would inexplicably run for no reason off and on throughout the first night. We mentioned that on our way out the 2nd morning....was again told it would be corrected....and it never was. Fortunately, the bathroom was just far enough away that we could not hear it throughout the night. It was still doing it the day we checked out. - On the 3rd day I asked a concierge about the possibility of obtaining reservations for the Borghese Gallery. I told him 11am or 1pm would work the best. He wrote the information down and we never heard back from anyone. Instead, we simply walked the gardens. - The 2nd night we returned to our room to find a bottle of champagne and some crackers. We were pleasantly surprised to find this right up until we realized it was not intended for us, but for another guest based on the name it was addressed to. We called the front desk and they came and took it away. - The evening of the 3rd day, we received a knock on the door and we were asked for our dry cleaning. The only problem, we had not requested any clothing to be cleaned. Individually, none of the aforementioned items would ever cause me to write a negative review. After a while, however, it became comical. Needless to say, this is not what one would expect from a 5* hotel. After a while, it was as if the concierge staff would listen to your request, act as though they cared, and simply forgot you the moment you hung up or walked out. If that's not enough, consider the following: euro 35 for breakfast buffet euro 9 / day for Internet euro .30/minute and euro .30/page to use and print from the internet downstairs - not that unusual at a Ramada Inn....but in a \"5*\" hotel after you've paid that amount....really?

This hotel needs a lot of attention refurbishment and updating to be a true 5 star luxury as rated. It is a 3 star at best. The staff are friendly nice hospitable which is a shame. This could be a great property in Rome but it needs more than TLC. Their website photographer is a genius or a true master at illusion We learnt a big lesson this evening. Never never trust websites and reviews that are all too perfect well written and extremely descriptive.

Plus that the rooms were next to each other with a private corridor, and the decorations were beautiful with calm tones, minus that they had the smallest windows, no view, and no natural light. Additionally, the lighting in the rooms was so dim, that I had hard time to pack and unpack even at the daytime. The both bathrooms were ok, actually the second room having quite a big and nice one. The strange thing was that despite of all the space, the shower has been tucked into the toilet room. Our other problem with the room was that being at the first floor, we seemed to have the complete sewage system of the hotel going through the corner of our room. It is not very nice to spend a romantic evening hearing the toilets flushed or upper floor neighbours taking showers!

First, I think that a hotel that has a Michelin starred restaurant, should not have such a pathetic roomservice food.

The photos looked so lovely! At best we would rate this place a 3.5! Royal? Splendide? Now that's a joke! As we arrived early, our room was not ready and the young lady (the only nice person in the place aside from the bellmen) said that there was one room on the first floor which was ready but she suggested we wait until the one on the 5th becomes available. So we wandered through Rome until we returned at 3:30 - where we found ourselves faced with two miserable men at the front desk. Although we had an email with us confirming a king size bed from the manager herself, we were taken up to a room with a double/queen. I would prefer to have called it a jail cel as the bed area did not even have a window! When I called downstairs they tried to convince me that this was a king bed. They then said that they were fully booked and the only other room they had was the one on the first floor. At least this had a window although it had two single beds pushed together. We were not in the room 5 minutes when my husband said \"shh, listen to this\". It sounded as though there was a flood of water gushing through the walls. We opened the window thinking that perhaps some one was cleaning the windows but were wrong. Again we called downstairs. Were they shocked to hear of the water noise? I think not! One of the men who claimed to have been in the business for thirty five years said to me that \"you get what you pay for\" and that we should have paid for a more expensive room. I was enraged! What kind of a 5 star hotel says something like this to a client. in fact WHAT hotel manager would say that to any client no matter what star classification. Meanwhile, I meet this couple at the front desk who are visibly upset as well. The woman waves a finger at me and says \"hotel no est bueno\". Her husband was ripping up his credit slip - they had gone to see their room which was a junior suite and they were not staying. Unfortunately we learned the hard way never to pre pay for a non refundable room otherwise we would have been out the door as well. My husband managed to \"find\" another room although we had been told that it was sold out and \"alas!\" it had a real king size bed. The room itself looked fine but again you could hear running water when someone flushed, used a sink or shower. At least this time the sounds came down into the bathroom walls and not the bedroom. You were able to hear all the movement from people above us (at 3:30 am moving suitcases we think) . In short the walls are like paper. The bed was terribly hard. They had to bring in a pillow top the 2nd night but that hardly made any difference for neither myself nor my husband. It was a further joke when they had this paper next to the bed boasting about their Doulce vita sheets which were more like hospital sheets at best - a very strange material which honestly does not feel like cotton. Believe it or not our cruise ship had beautiful sheets and a most comfortable bed even after 17 nights although ship beds are used day in and day out 365 days a year. My back felt broken on the plane ride home because of this two terrible nights at the Unsplendided. I normally would never take the time to write a review but I really think people should be aware of the audacity that some hotels have in calling themselves 5 star. There are so many other truly beautfiul hotels in Rome - we heard from our limo driver that the Eden which was right around the corner was lovely and about the same price as well as the Hassler, but that one is top dollar. The one good thing I will say is the location was great.

We were extremely pleased with all aspects of the service provided from the moment we got out of the car from the airport to the moment we left for our return home. Just some examples of the service provided.... We arrived in Rome and found the hottest and most humid weather we'd ever experienced. When we arrived at the hotel in the morning, tired and sweaty, earlier than our check in time we were informed that our room was not yet ready but we were given two options. One was to switch to another room or two, they could put us in a temporary room to freshen. Whle we were perfectly happy to use the bathroom and leave our bags with the doorman we were very happy to have these options. We took the temporary room as our original room was larger than the alternative that was ready at that moment. Thankfully we did this because it allowed us to relax and rest for an hour or so as we freshened up and took only what we needed for our walk around the city. We left our bags in the room and the front desk called us later that afternoon on our cell to inform us that our room was ready. The staff took care of moving our bags into our other room so that when we arrived back that evening we found our bags waiting for us. We'd like to thank some individuals who made our arrival and stay so wonderful. Ivano at the front desk who made arrangments for the temporary room and Stefano and Luciano who took care of our bags for us. The rooms on both the pre and post cruise stay were spectacular. The first room had an interior courtyard view which while not too picturesque was fine as we were busy enjoying the interior. The room we had at the end of our cruise was overlooking the Villa Borghese and you could see the dome of St. Peter's from the window. Despite the different views we would describe both rooms (both on the fourth floor) as spacious, lots of closet/drawers for hanging and storing clothes, very well appointed and comfortable with wonderfully luxurious bathrooms. The hotel is located right across the street from the Villa Borghese and is a 5 minute walk to the Spanish steps and Via Condotti, close to all the important sights and shopping while being a bit removed from all the crowds of that area. We walked everywhere as we've been to Rome several times and know our way around fairly well. The breakfasts were wonderful at Terrace Limonaia and we even had dinner at the hotel restaurant, Mirabelle, which was magical. Both restaurants overlook the Villa Borghese so the views are wonderful in the morning and spectacular in the evening. In conclusion, everyone at the hotel was friendly and greeted you with a smile and took the time to answer all your questions and even just to talk. They were helpful with restaurant suggestions and any needs we had were met to our complete satisfaction. We would highly recommend the Hotel Splendide Royale for anyone who is planning a stay in Rome.

Beware!!!!\u201d", "Author": "KarinaMilovidova", "ReviewID": "UR66008347", "Content": "Luckily I never stayed at the hotel, and will never do! My disappointment started from the moment of booking. I was looking for the 5 star hotel for the upcoming weekend with the room with terrace and sunbeds. It occured that the hotel has such kind of rooms. I made the booking for three nights with the total amount of about 2500 euros for the whole stay. According to the web site the booking must be guaranteed by the valid credit card (which is usual when you provide the hotel with the number of your card in case that you do not show and they will have the opportunity to withdrow one night amount as a compensation). Well, this policy is really common at any respectful hotel of 5 stars. But what a surprise! In 30 minutes after the booking I received the sms from my bank showing the blocking of the amount of 835 euros done by the hotel....... I called the hotel and was redirected to the \"lady\" (general manager's personal assistant). This \"lady\" was unbelivably rude, she cried at me, interrupted all the time and insisted that I'm a real fool, that does not have any idea what real 5 star hotel is and what policy is apropriate there. I tried to explain the situation from my side. But she never listened, just cried all the time. If the hotel books any amount from the account of the quest 5 days prior to the arrival date, not asking permition for that, it means that the hotel is unpolite and can not be trusted. Of course if the cancelation policy was one week before deposit guaranteed, than no problem! But in the booking confirmation it was written that the booking can be canceled free of charge 24 prior the arrival date. The \"lady\" cried that this is legal and approved, that such policy is common, and such bookings are done only to proove that the card is valid.....sorryyyyyyy? I asked to unblock the amount or I will cancel the booking. The \"lady\" said that it is impossible technically..... I asked to cancell the booking. The \"lady\" said it is impossible too........ She adviced to do all that myself online, despite the fact the at the booking it was clearly written that the booking can only be cancelled by contacting the hotel, by mail or by fax.... So, this \"lady\" is not even aware of the rules of the hotel where she's working. In any way thanks to this rude dame the hotel lost minimum 3000 euros of income, but maybe this amount is just nothing for such a 5 star hotel. I asked to forward my call to the general manager, as far I could not stand any more the unpolite and rude hysteria. But according to the \"lady\" the manager was not in the office of course... At last after offering the opportunity to solve the problem through communication of my lawyer with the legal department of the hotel, the \"lady\" became scared and followed my asks canceling the booking at once and unblocking the amount. Suddenly all the technical impossibilities were solved, suddenly it was confirmed that the hotel booked the amount (previously the \"lady denied that fact and offered me to call my bank to find out why they block the amount with the name of the hotel...). Well, hope that the personal assistant to the general manager will become more professional with time and will improve her behaviour, as it spoils the impression of the whole hotel in general.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSplendid hotel for a truly Roman experience\u201d", "Author": "billiverstravels", "ReviewID": "UR65775855", "Content": "We chose a Junior Suite and we could not have been more pleased because it was exactly what we wanted in Rome - a hotel that was truly Roman/Italian in its flavor and furnishings.

We did not mind the linen sheets (a nice weight - no blanket needed), but if you prefer, you can request cotton sheets. I'm a stickler about temperature control and the suite had very quickly responsive controls. The breakfast (included) was on one of the top floors in a nicely appointed room with sweeping views over the city, including St. Peters. The selection was fine and everything was fresh.

On the positive side, as others have said, the location of the hotel is perfect - 5 minutes from the Spanish Steps, a 15 minute brisk walk to the Trevi Fountain - yet its position near the Borghese Gardens means it is relatively quiet. The decor is beautiful - Baroque opulence but the general effect achieved in a warm and welcoming style. Our deluxe room (206) on the second floor was beautifully decorated and well equipped. The marble bathroom was lovely with great toiletries, a deep (if narrow) bath and separate spacious shower cubicle. The maid service was extremely efficient, thorough and unobtrusive and the complimentary chocolates stylish and delicious. The 'view' however, consisted of a narrow street, a high brick wall and a few tree tops! Having been fortunate enough to stay in many five star hotels we were surprised to discover that at this one there is no room service available between 11p.m. and 7a.m. - not great if one arrives on a late flight (surely not an unusual occurrence in a capital city!) This is exacerbated by the fact that there are no tea or coffee making facilities available either. Staff on the front desk were polite and generally helpful if a little remote. We did however have a major issue which could have proved disasterous on our final day when the hotel car prebooked and prepaid for earlier in the day failed to materialise. There then followed some tense moments as the staff who initially appeared somewhat unconcerned grasped the seriousness of the situationm - eventually managing as a last resort to hail us a cab which shot us at breakneck speed through the streets, enabling us to catch our flight with minutes to spare - not an ideal end to what was supposed to be a relaxing break! I have delayed submitting this report to Trip Advisor in order to give the hotel a chance to apologise for the trauma and inconvenience caused and, more importantly, to refund the difference between the 70+ euros paid for the limo transfer and the 35 Approx euros for the taxi. To date however, (9 days after returning home) nothing has been forthcoming despite our sending three e mails! To say that my husband is furious is something of an understatement.

The rooms are very nice, particularly the junior suites with terraces overlooking the Borghese Gardens.

For our last stay I emailed the hotel to book a specific room that we like, and got confirmation in writing that it would be reserved for us ( I did this as the hotel managed to muck up our room request the previous year). I then emailed again a week before our stay just to reconfirm, and when we arrived .... you guessed it. !. After much arguing we did eventually get our room. Our in-room Internet connection failed, and the hotel didn't seem capable of getting it fixed - at one point the miserable git on reception put me through to their service provider !. I requested use of the PC in the lobby and was told that I would be charged for this - I did point out that I had already paid for the in-room internet access which wasn't working !. Again after much arguing they agreed to waive the charge, but it still appeared on our final bill - and I didn't have the time or enthusiasm to argue again. Don't order the breakfast in the room - 25 Euros for a cup of cold (instant !!) coffee and some (not so fresh) rolls and cakes ! Hotel is in a lovely position, the rooms are great and some of the staff are lovely - if they could just replace a couple of the \"old school\" staff on reception, and be a bit more diligent answering and acting on emails - it would be worth the (not inconsiderable) price they charge.

The hotel is facing the Villa Borghese with a perfect view and is only 2 blocks away from Via Veneto. This is not a big luxury hotel. It is a small hotel with a small entrance. The reception desk (also the concierge desk) is also small. The first impression is not very good, because of the small entrance and reception, and also some worn out details at the main entrance and the reception desk (some painting there would make a lot of difference). The room was very nice, with beautiful marble floors, perfect and spacious veranda (will be perfect in the summer). The service was excellent. The hotel is lacking in small details. For The breakfast buffet was not up to a luxury level. It had all the usual staff, but cannot be considered a 5-star breakfast. I was also suprised to learn that boiled eggs and fried eggs are charged as extras. There were only scrambled eggs in the buffet. When paying over 600 Euros a room you would expect that you wouldn't be charged for boiled eggs. It is not the amount that is important, but you get the bad feeling that you are not considered as an welcome guest. They could charge the room 10 Euros more and include all these, not peculiar, things like boiled and fried eggs. The breakfast in general could be improved a lot, the buffet and the environment. There is a gourmet restaurant on the top floor, classic and expensive, requiring a jacket for men and awarded with a Michelin star. The service is excellent in the restaurant. The decoration was a little heavy for my taste, and the food was generally good but not very impressive, at least up to its price. This is a general problem with michelin restaurants. The best food I have had in many cities and countries is usually not at michelin restaurants. The reception and concierge service was good, but could be much better. They looked always busy and I preferred not to bother them with my questions. One question of mine regarding a famous restaurant in Rome (Tote a la Carroze) was in vain. They had not heard of it, and even a search in the internet did not give them results! Anyway Toto a la Carroze (Carroze street near Piazza di Spagna) is a very good restaurant (even if not \"michelined\"), and a strong recommendation. The cleaning service was perfect, the turn-down service also, although I was somehow sorry for only bringing one small bottle of water and not two, or a large bottle. Again, it is not the amount, but the way you are treated. The location is perfect. Close to via Veneto (5min walk) and Piazza di Spagna (10min walk). There is a gym, but it is very small. One treadmil, one bicycle, one multi-organ and a few barbells. 2 persons are a crowd. In general, the Splendide was a positive experience, the first impression was a little negative, there are a few details that can be improved and my recomendation to the hotel would be to be more generous in treating their guests like boiled eggs with no charge or a second bottle of water every night. I would recommend this hotel.", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDoesn't come close to its gem of a neighbour Sofitel Rome Villa Borghese\u201d", "Author": "Car0lineB", "ReviewID": "UR49417013", "Content": "We booked this hotel for four nights as it was given similar reviews (and is currently similar in price) to that of its neighbour, Sofitel Rome Villa Borghese (per the expedia.co.uk website). We stayed at the Sofitel in the summer, and it couldn't be faulted, but this cannot be said of the Splendide Royal. At the Splendide Royal the service was very poor - there was no real feeling that you were welcome, or that the staff were going to go out of their way to help you (it felt like an imposition to the staff when we asked for something, or made a complaint about something). The rooms are very tired, the televisions are the size of a computer screen and the room service is terrible. Particular disappointments we had are as follows: We booked a superior room, yet when we arrived in the room, there was constant noise of water running down the back of the wall (it sounded like water ran down everytime someone from upstairs had a bath or shower). It wasn't a peaceful trickling of water, it was a loud gush which happened frequently. When I called reception to let them know, they acted very surprised. I asked to see another superior room (it was not offered), and when I was taken to see one, it was clearly just a standard room which they tried to convince me was a superior one (I confirmed with the person on duty the following day that the room they had shown me as an alternative was a standard room). When I spoke to a different member of staff to the person on the front desk, he advised me that they were fully aware of this noise, which made me quite angry, as the person on the front desk feigned ignorance to me. This person was also very rude when I asked what other rooms they could offer us as a replacement, he merely replied that I should wait until tomorrow and ask them then. I would have thought the hotel would have made the effort to tell me the other superior rooms available for the next few days and offer to put us in there (this was not offered), surely it wasn't up to me to chase them?! The night we checked in we ordered room service, and whilst I understand you pay a premium, the amount we paid vs the quality of the food was just laughable. My husband and I had one main (a pasta and a club sandwich) and a side each (sauteed potatoes). The sides were not listed on the menu so we weren't aware of the price until we got the bill. Whilst I could have asked the price when I ordered, not for one second did I think that a plate of sauteed potatoes would be in excess of 20 euros each! We went to several well regarded restaurants and ate lovely Italian food, but not one meal we had came to over 100 euros (which was the price of our room service), and the food was of a significantly higher standard to the food provided by room service. We were travelling with a 12 month old and as it was evening when we checked in, I asked if they could send up a couple of bananas that I could give him with his dinner. When room service arrived they had supplied six bananas and we were charged 25 euros! I was astounded at the cheek of them first sending up six when I had only asked for two, and then charging us more than 4 euros per banana! Needless to say, I sent them back. The next day we left our room around 10am to do some sightseeing, and arrived back at our room around 3.30pm. Although we had left the 'please clean the room' sign on the door, the room had not been touched. Surely this is the one thing that hotels should not fail on. When I called down to reception to advise them of this, they were not apologetic, the attitude was almost \"oh well\". They did arrange for the room to be done, but the last thing we wanted to do was sit in our room watching two staff members do a very average tidy up, which is what we ended up doing. It did not feel like we were staying at a 5 star hotel, it was almost like we were staying at Faulty Towers.", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chelmsford UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "sarach", "ReviewID": "UR49211223", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for one night with my partner for a romantic break and lets just say that the Hotel was the icing on the cake!!

This hotel definitely has its good and bad points. The Splendide bills itself as a 5 Star and in some respects it is. At least it tries to be. It certainly is 5 Star when it comes to rates so if you\u2019re looking for a bargain this is not the hotel for you. We knew that going in, of course, and on this trip price was not an issue. The hotel is nicely decorated, clean and reflects an upscale atmosphere in all areas. Our room, a Deluxe Double with a view, ($440 EU plus 10% service) was large by European standards and had a small but, luxurious bath. The room overlooked the Borghese Gardens (tree tops actually) and the street (noise level was tolerable). The room had 1 large and 1 smaller chair which meant there really wasn\u2019t a comfortable place to lounge for the 2 of us. We spent most of our time away form the hotel sightseeing so this was no a huge issue but, a small sofa would have a big improvement. The room also had a safe and windows that opened. The bed was the typical European king that consists of 2 extra long twins joined together. If you like extra hard beds (billed as orthopedic) this place is for you. We found as in other upscale hotels in Italy, Splendide offered linen sheets with an option to have your bed made with cotton sheets. It must have been the laundry process as the linen here was so rough after the second night we ended up requesting the cotton sheets (big improvement). The bath, as I mentioned, was small (narrow actually) but, had nice features such as a soaking tub, dual sinks, bidet, towel warming rack, converter plug, big fluffy towels and separate shower. The shower was so tiny you could hardly move in it but, the water pressure was gloriously strong and the head delivered the stream in a soft soothing rain. The hotel has 2 restaurants. Mirabelle on the 7th floor offers a very formal atmosphere but, had a casual outdoor terrace overlooking the Vatican. We enjoyed dinner our first night on the Terrace despite the fact it was mainly for cocktails and light fair. The Management and staff were quick to please and accommodated our request before I had finished uttering the words. The restaurant boasts a Michelin 1 Star Chef and lived up to the rating. Dinner was not inexpensive but, the combination of view, service, food and alfresco dining made it simply magical. Worth going out of your way for. I have to give full credit here in regards to the service. I have been in the hotel and restaurant business for 35 years and it was as good as I have seen. Anticipatory to the point of simply turning your head towards the service staff and they were already in motion to take car of your needs. Yet, unobtrusive. Never interrupting, never hovering. Just perfect! I can\u2019t give them enough praise. I can only assume that Mirabelle was not operated by the hotel as the difference was like night and day in regards to the rest of the service we encountered. Terrace La Limonaia is located on the 6th floor is open for breakfast. We ate here twice and then found a number of wonderful small restaurants neighboring the hotel to have breakfast in. At 35 EU each for an American breakfast we found the food here to be among the poorest quality we encounter in Italy. In this case it\u2019s worth the trip to go somewhere else! Starting before our arrival and continuing through our stay we were disappointed and frustrated with the service we received at the front desk. All except, Enrico were worthless. I had utilized the hotel provided email addresses to email the Concierge ahead of time in an effort to organize some restaurant reservations. I never got a response. I then emailed the Assistant to the GM. No response. I even emailed the GM. No response. So when we arrived I asked 1 of the young ladies at the desk to assist with reservations. She said she would take care of and it. When I returned sometime latter I was told by a gentlemen nothing had been done. The young lady I spoke with happen to be sitting at desk behind the counter. When I suggested he speak with her, he acted like she wasn\u2019t there and began asking me what kind of restaurant I was looking for. On another occasion, we approached the desk to ask for a restaurant recommendation. While no guests were present, the 2 gentlemen ignored us for some time. Finally ,1 of them asked if we were checking in. I said \u201cno, we\u2019ve been here for 3 days. I need a restaurant reservation\u201d. I was then quickly given the name of a restaurant around the corner and dismissed. I decided to look it up on Trip Advisor first and found it to be poorly rated as very touristy. Needless to say we went elsewhere (Pierluigi) which was great. Each time we went to the desk they acted as if we were invisible and they were to busy to help. When they did engage us they were acted haughty. The place was like Faulty Towers when it came to service. A real joke! We saw a portly, balding gentleman in a suit on 3 or 4 occasions who was either the GM or some kind of manager. He went out of his way to avoid speaking to the guests. I guess he has trained the staff well!

Within walking distance to major attractions and the Metro but not too noisy. Definitely not an inexpensive hotel, but we did get reasonable rates by booking the room directly with the hotel on-line, which was followed by helpful e-mails by the concierage to enhance our stay.

Traveling the end of July in Rome is not the ideal time of year--real hot; coming from Florida, that wasn't a concern. But, the AC/temp control, a good shower , and location were, a priority, among other things. We enjoyed a pleasant, comfortable stay for 6 nights. The room was a large King, very good-sized bathroom, and as Europe goes, a good shower. Even though it was low 90's (32-33C), the room temp was fine and we never had an issue. It was clean, housekeeping was accommodating of our schedule and met our needs. Their desk personnel and concierge did a great job monitoring and pestering our airline carrier who failed to get our bags to arrive the same time we did. They were great, pursuing them regularly. We finally got 3 of 4 bags two days late and the 4th three days late--they were great with recommendations on local, not touristy, places to eat, how to get around easily, efficiently, and when we needed to find a fresh set of clothes after two days of no bags they pointed us to a couple of very reasonable department stores rather than the high end fashion places. There are only 57 rooms or so and I think they do a good job trying to be personal with their \"Buon Giorno or Bona Sera Mr and Mrs Name\". The Borghese Gardens and Gallery, just two blocks up Via Pinciana are a must. Via Veneto is fine, but there are less expensive restaurants and better food to be found off the tourist main drag. We did not go for the meal or drink on the top floor of the hotel (7th FL?). We did go up to check it out, but found it very formal and after speaking to a couple of guest who just left there, they said great view and all of that, but average food and very over-priced. We found some great views on a hill over in Trestevere and other places, so a high-priced meal or drink in a hotel wasn't a must. Subway can be caught in two different places, either south down Via Veneto or right at the Spanish Steps. So many great things to do, just ask for help.

The hotel is stunningly beautiful; the decor is a little more lavishly Italian than my own personal taste tends to be, but everything is absolutely gorgeous. For being in a reasonably old building, I was amazed at how new everything was, from the sumptuous carpets, wall paper, and drapes to the elegant light fixtures and ornate furniture. The bathroom was particularly exceptional, featuring ample marble counter space with twin sinks, as well as separate rooms for the whirlpool bathtub and glass-enclosed shower, all gleaming with black and white marble; it was the nicest, most luxurious bathroom I have ever experienced in a standard room. And while there are many nice hotels in Rome with beautiful interiors, the Splendide stands out by virtue of its wonderful location and service. Its situation near the Villa Borghese is absolutely ideal. The surrounding area is mostly quiet and not a mecca for tourists--a godsend in a city as frenetic as Rome--and it features some of the most beautiful views in the city, looking out towards the gardens of the Borghese on the one side and the Vatican on the other. The charming breakfast room near the top of the hotel showcased these magnificent views, and the Michelin starred restaurant at the top with its wonderful balcony sported the most breathtaking tableau of the city I have yet enjoyed. Surveying the lush, endless trees on one side and the grand dome of St. Peter's on the other, one could not help feeling like one had surely landed in paradise. To top it all off, the staff were friendly and impeccably helpful; they made us feel as though we were the only guests in the hotel. For that matter, I constantly marveled out how quiet the hotel was--save for meals in the restaurants, we were hardly ever aware of other guests. The hotel was a supremely civilized refuge in the heart of Rome, and for a city that can be positively overwhelming with its unending tourists and manic pace, it was a godsend, exactly what you would want from an upscale hotel in the heart of Rome. I cannot imagine a place more ideally suited to the needs of the discerning traveler in the eternal city, and I hope very much to return.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montalegre (Portogallo)", "Title": "\u201cFor sure we'll stay again at the Spledide Royal Rome\u201d", "Author": "telhado1951", "ReviewID": "UR35152060", "Content": "Beautiful hotel in the heart of Rome.

First impressions are very good; although rather ostentatious the d\u00e9cor & furnishing are top quality, very opulent & well maintained throughout the hotel. The rooms aren\u2019t particularly large but ours was beautifully presented & room cleaning was top notch, overall I would give the hotel a positive review, it adds real \u201cfeel good factor\u201d to your Rome visit! There are also great views from the 7th floor bar & restaurant & also from the 6th floor breakfast rooms. Some of the staff are very good (e.g. one of the reception managers, Franchesco I believe, was excellent) friendly & helpful others unfortunately were not rather souring the overall experience. - points:- The negatives started before we arrived with emails repeatedly ignored & it took much effort to get the information we required. On arrival the receptionist (or concierge, an older middle eastern gentleman called Maleck I think?) had a rather obnoxious, arrogant attitude that made you feel he wasn\u2019t interested in his clients, in fact he was bordering on rude throughout our stay! This patchy variance in staff attitude has been mentioned in earlier reports & it is something the hotel needs to sort! The way a hotel treats its guests is part of the experience & the overall service & attitude didn\u2019t live up to 5 star rating, the prices however do with a small beer costing 10E and evening meal around 150E a head without drinks! We were expecting a comprehensive high quality breakfast in view of the 35E a head cost & the hotels Michelin star rating, but although perfectly adequate it certainly fell short of other hotels (particularly with regards to the very poor English Breakfast selection!) although the fruits were good & the Espresso excellent. Also be aware that most Superior rooms have a poor view of the inner courtyard & you will likely have to pay extra for a view (best on the 6th floor!), having said this it wasn\u2019t a major problem as we spent most of our time out & about. In contrast to our luxury room the balcony featured rusty railings with a view of a huge air-con unit & pipes, this could easily have been screened/presented in a positive way & is an illustration of the patchy attention to detail offered by the hotel, with excellence in some areas meeting negatives in others. Summary- Despite the few downsides the Splendide still offers very good value for money via Expedia, it may be a little more expensive but overall it justifies its price with a good location & luxury surroundings, they even helped us with a late check out which was much appreciated. The hotel simply need to re-train the few uncaring members of staff that can spoil the experience & it would be spot on!", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wiltshire", "Title": "\u201cFive Star Hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "Duckanddickie", "ReviewID": "UR34645167", "Content": "Helpful staff, impressive surroundings.

The location of the hotel is quite convenient to exploring the eternal city.

Yet the most delightful part of the hotel was its personnel, particularly its concierge service. They were very helpful in assisting us in planning our day, as well as in making reservations to restaurants and museums, as well as in helping to set up the internet. Among the personnel we must point out Ivan Crisanti, who really made our stay the more memorable by his enthusiasm for the city and its treasures, and his love for Caravaggio in particular. We stayed at the hotel for nine days and began to feel really at home. It was difficult to leave. We would not hesitate to return to the Splendide Royal for our next visit. We must recommend to all visitors to get the three-day Roma Pass at any official tourist information site, as it offers unlimited access to the metro and the bus system, plus free access to the first two historic sites/museums you visit.

The photos of the lobby do look impressive on the website and you wonder what the rest of the hotel is like, but the lobby is what you see and is very small. Location is good in terms of the area, but it is on a back street in the Via Veneto area. Cabs aren't to be found outside the hotel and there is the odd seedy bar around.

There are around 40 rooms in total and the room sizes are very good. We took a triple room and this was organised very well. The decor is a little dated, but I would still say that the room was very comfortable. There is a standard 17-19 inch LCD screen and 2 telephones in the room. There is a walk-in closet and a safe. The bathroom is as you would expect in a 5 star hotel with 2 sinks and with nice toileteries. The room did lack tea/coffee facilities and the minibar is extortionate. The wifi internet is also very expensive. We had an english breakfast included in our room rate and took this at the rooftop Mirabelle Restarant.

Before each trip, I always consult Tripadvisor to read the comments on hotels we are considering. We were originally booked at a hotel by the Spanish Steps, but changed our minds a few weeks before our trip due to current very negative remarks on TripAdvisor. I cannot tell you how much we value everyone's comments on this site. After reading about several other hotels, we changed to the Splendide Royal and am very thankful that we did. I don't know why we did not choose this hotel to begin with. We have traveled extensively and cannot give this hotel high enough marks. From the gracious welcome, to the beautiful room with a balcony overlooking Rome, to the welcome chocolates and note, to the superb service, this hotel is a real treat. The staff are warm, generous with their time and a wealth of knowledge. The location is easy walking distance to almost everything, as mentioned by previous contributors. We discovered that the city tour bus stops just around the corner and is an easy get on/off bus with the ticket good for 2 days. We took this bus on a full circuit around to get our bearings. (Get the earphones for an excellent guide to each site. Keep the earphones handy for each trip on the bus.) This bus will take you to every site that you would want to see. We then took the bus down to a central point and walked to many sites. Our room was lovely with plenty of closet space and a very large bath with jacuzzi tub. I agree with a previous comment about the scratchy sheets and did not read the information about other choices. My mistake. I am sure if I would have asked, this would have been corrected. At the end of our stay in Rome, we rented a car from Hertz at the Borgese location that is walking distance from the hotel and an easy exit from the city. Bottom line - wonderful hotel; great staff; quiet convenient location; spacious room; sophisticated, understated elegance Note: Be sure to continue checking comments on your hotel choices even after you have made a reservation.

As part of this celebration, we spent two nights at the Hotel Splendide Royal (Room 201). Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The hotel is within a short taxi ride from the main train station (Roma Termini). It is located in a quiet part of town directly across from the Borghese Gardens. The hotel is also home to the Michelin starred restaurant Mirabelle (located on the rooftop with inside and outside terrace seating). We arrived at the hotel around noon. Checking in was pleasant, convenient, & our room was already prepared for us. The room was nice - very good size room, spacious & clean bathroom, courtyard view. The room was very quiet so we were able to sleep very well (during both the day - jetlag - and during the evening). Strangely, though, the bed was really uncomfortable - as if the mattress had been replaced by a box spring (not a huge issue - just strange for the quality of the hotel). Our room rate included breakfast so both mornings we made our way to the 6th floor dining room for breakfast. The dining room was very nice and bright - filled with natural light. The food was good and well presented. The restaurant serving staff were very professional as well. One tip regarding breakfast - try to avoid a table in the center of the restaurant (close to the buffet). The floor is very unstable around the buffet so every time anyone walks towards or around the buffet the people seated in the center of the room have to hold onto coffee cups and juice glasses to avoid having them spill (not a big deal as we were able to have a really good laugh over how much our table shook & how much coffee spilled during our meal). On the second morning, we sat around the outside of the room and everything was fine. We didn't eat at Mirabelle, but we did have drinks there twice. Once in the afternoon and once in the evening.

From the moment we arrived at the Splendide, we were made to feel truly \"special\". The Splendide's location was truly ideal. As directed by concierge Ivan and Frabricio, we were easily in walking distance of most of the important and fun sites that we had wanted to experience---the Spanish Steps, the shopping district, the Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, and the Piazza Navona, not to mention the Via Veneto. What we really liked about the Splendide was it's location across the street from the Borghese Gardens and Museums. Although we were in the heart of Rome, there was the beauty and peace of overlooking the Gardens, making this a better retreat than the Hassler or others that were in the crowded business district. Only a few blocks to where all of the action was! The hotel itself was lovely and clean. We stayed here twice during our trip, each time having beautiful rooms overlooking the Gardens. The rooms were traditionally decorated with fine bathrooms, all immaculately maintained. Becuase we had children with us, they accomodated our request for adjoining/adjacent rooms, even upgrading us to a suite when we first arrived! What a treat!!! We did use the internet service, which was easy to use We ate breakfast in the hotel, which was a perfect way to start the day. We did not eat in their acclaimed restaurant, Mirabelle, because of our children and the cost. Men are not allowed to wear dress shorts there, even for a cocktail. Everyone who we spoke to that ate there said it was a wonderful experience. The only downfall was the weight room, which needs updating, and the lack of a pool, not uncommon in Rome hotels. That was easily remedied by the Splendide as they offered the use of the pool at their affiliated hotel, the Parco de Principe, which was located nearby. Most of all, we LOVED the staff! From the welcoming doormen to the waitstaff in the breakfast room to the conciege staff, they all made you feel like royalty. I must mention the concierge Ivan, as he truly went out of his way to make this a special event for our family's celebration.

I would like to start by making a special mention however about Ivan the concierge. I had been in touch by e-mail on a regular basis leading up to our holiday, regarding arrangements to pick up from the airport ,to booking restuarants. All which he did and his attention to detail was second to none. Ivan also arranged for us to renew our wedding vows at a very special chapel adjacent to the hotel which was just magical and highly recommend Ivan! The suite itself was just beautiful, the rooms were highly decorated, had a jacuzzi bath which we all made great use of after walking round Rome!. Luxury was a given here, and to compliment the rooms was a magnificent terrace over looking the Villa Borghese Park. It was outstanding and was certainly the highlight of our suite, every room including the bathroom had a door leading onto the terrace. It was quite private, had luxury rattan loungers, settee and table, as well as our own parasol table and chairs. The terrace was covered in Jasmine and wonderful plants which made it wonderful to sit out on an evening and watch the sun go down over the spanish steps! We stopped on a bed and breakfast basis, and the breakfast was ample enough to suit everyones taste and choices, I even heard a guest being asked how many minutes she would like her egg boiled for! Again the staff and service was deserving of the hotels status and excellence. We did dine at the hotel Mirabelle restuarant on the 7th floor for our 25th anniversary meal, which was really spectacular. We had an excellent table on the balcony over looking St Peters and its something we shall remember for a long time. The food was well deserving of its michelin star and was a truly memorable experience. The hotel is only five minutes away from the spanish steps and is quite central, with some great bars and restuarants around it. Although if in doubt, just ask Ivan, and he will point you in the direction of some excellent restaurants as he did for us. It was our first trip to Rome and hopefully the first of many to come. If you want a truly special experience, build your relationship with the hotel via Ivan, ask for all those details you want confirming so that when you finally get there is just pure pleasure. Just before I forget, when we got to our room, the hotel delievered to us complimentary champagne, cake and nibbles with their compliments for 2 nights leading up to our anniversary which also gave it that extra special touch.

The location is only a little out of the way from the Spanish steps, but not something a moderately fit person would regard as an issue. In any event it is convenient to the Via Veneto, still a fun place for a nice lunch and a spot of people watching.

The bathrooms were fine...tiled floors and walls, nice bath and separate room for the shower and toilet/bidet. Everyone slept well. The breakfast on the 6th floor overlooks Rome and was the perfect gathering spot for our group. The buffet was the same all mornings...scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage on one table with a variety of cheeses; on another table were croissants, rolls and yougurts. There were four juices and several cereals to choose from. Bottled still and sparkling water and champagne were also plentiful. The service was attentive. The best aspect of the hotel is the service. Fabiola and Ivan were teriffic as conceirges. They recommended a number of excellent restaurants, which we loved. After consulting them via e-mail before arrival, we landed on these for dinner: Colline Emililane; Pierluigi; Agata e Romeo; Da Pietro; Girarrosto Fiorentino; and Mirabelle on top of the hotel. All the staff treated us warmly (six nights x four rooms at 400 Euros =9600 Euros or about $16,000). The exception was the bar upstairs, when one night, my wife, one daughter and i appeared for a nightcap dressed casually...i had to complain to get service (see below) The American Bar on the same floor as the restaurant, a Michelin-starred restaurant, has a nice terrace overlooking Rome with views of the Vatican, which is lovely at night. Drinks aren't cheap, however, so you may opt to have a late-night appertif near the Spanish Steps. But save a night for Mirabelle (and save your money to pay for it!). The food was excellent and worthy of the rating. Message to Americans: This hotel is not cheap; with the dollar at a low, it will cost you a pretty penny to stay here. Its worth the money. My only nit is the one evening at the American Bar. I was not dressed with a sport coat and I give the place a black mark for not asking if we were guests as we appeared. I believe they judged us by the way we were dressed and didn't realize i was spending a lot of money with the hotel. But, the other nights we were there, we had no issues(we had sport coats). The location is great. I must say, my parents needed taxis due to their age, but it is not as tough getting around as some reviews note.

Once we checked in, we were given recommendations on what to see on what days and routes to take to ensure we were able to see everything we wanted to see in the four days. Ivan was the person we spoke to and he was fabulous. He also recommended a few things we didn't know about that were on our way and really worth seeing. He also let us in on the secrets to avoiding the long lines at St. Peter's, the Forum and the Colisseum. Ivan made wonderful recommendations each night for dinner. We throughly enjoyed the restaurants he recommended. Most were casual, local places with excellent food and atmosphere that really gave you a more local Roman experience. We loved the rooftop bar and usually spent some time there before dinner each night. It is a little pricey but the views are worth the expense. It is located at the restaurant so if you aren't dressed for dinner, you will probably be seated in a corner out of the sight of other patrons. We were casually dressed as you would be on a realxing holiday so we were always seated out of sight. Other than that, service at the bar was excellent as well.

Lots of waiters in tail coats, candles and roses on the table - a crooner with a piano and a repetroire of Andy Williams classics added to the romantic nostalgia.

Hotel rooms were large by European standards, coming with an entry way joining the bathroom, bedroom and closet. The bedroom was very clean and nicely furnished with a large armchair, desk, flat screen cable, etc. The deluxe room also had a walk-in closet/changing area. The sheets were linen, not cotton, so were very crisp (and not very soft). Fortunately, I am a fan of crisp sheets, although others may not be. Also, the staff did an excellent job of cleaning and arranging each day, making the room a nice sanctuary to return to at the end of each day. The bathroom was also nicely appointed with marble everywhere, fresh robes, towel warmer, a good share of toiletries (including bath salts), etc. Bathroom also included a tub, rather than shower stall. The cloth curtain, held to the rod by plastic loops, didn't quite wrap enough around the tub to avoid the spillage noted in earlier reviews. The bottom of the tub barely fit two feet together while facing the showerhead. The bathtub seems more suitable for soaking, as it is definitely deep enough (and much more comfortable to sit in). The 3rd floor room we got overlooked the street that separates the hotel from Borghese, and also Borghese if you looked beyond the street. Our room was at tree line so much of the park was obscured. However, if you craned your head out the window to the left, it made for a nice view of the city at sunset. Breakfasts were very plentiful as indicated by other reviewers, and very tasty. Also, the view from the breakfast room is absolutely lovely in the morning. For all of this it seemed like a great place to stay and recommend to friends, provided you have zero interaction with the front desk day staff. Ivan was incredibly helpful in booking us reservations (at a cost of 3 euro extra per ticket) during the incredibly \u201cbusy\u201d season, while using words like \u201cidiota\u201d while smiling cheerfully at us. (November and December, as we confirmed at the attraction, are low seasons when reservations are not at all necessary). When asked if it was very busy at the attraction, Ivan confirmed that it was indeed very busy, and would likely be difficult to change the reservation. Umberto, was helpful in booking us the private hotel limo (cost of 60 euro), since it was \u201cmuch better\u201d than the taxis. The hotel limo was a flat rate as opposed to the varying rate that taxis could charge. When asked, he told us the taxi rate could be anywhere between 45, 50 or 55 euro (turns out, the taxi rate to/from FCO is actually fixed at 40 euro). He assured us this was a good deal, as we would get a different better experience. Different, yes. The driver dropped us at the wrong terminal. The driver also assured us it was definitely the correct one, even after we told him our flight destination. Needless to say, this \u201cidiota\u201d of a turista will be researching future stays elsewhere. The location, rooms, and housekeeping staff are great.

This hotel should be renamed to \"Splen-dud\". I'm shocked at how this hotel could have received an overall rating of 5 - it just confounds me. This is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. I'd give it zero stars if I could. First, when you check-in, not only do you give them your passport so they can photocopy it (this is standard practice at all hotels), but you are forced to fill out a long form with the same exact information that is contained on your passport (which they just photocopied). What's the point of that! Then, instead of photocopying your credit card (like most hotels do, which is common practice), they take your card, run it through the old contraption (that retailers in the 1980's used to have) that makes an impression or carbon copy of your credit card...and then they make you sign it - so folks, this is basically a blank receipt that you're authorizing. This makes it difficult to contest unwarranted charges with your credit card company if the hotel decides to randomly charge you for something you did not authorize nor use. In the eyes of your credit card company, if there's a receipt with an authenticated signature on it...you're out of luck. We arrived at the hotel a full 2 hours past check-in time...the room wasn't ready. We specifically requested a quiet room, and to them that means a room by the heavily trafficked stairwell. When we asked to be moved...we got blank stares and were barely acknowledged. They finally said they'd look into it and get back to us. We never heard anything from them regarding the change in the entire time we were there. Btw, there's no real concierge. We inquired about tours and such. We were handed a brochure and left to our own devices. They weren't interested in assisting us in any way, so we walked over to the Sofitel Roma (which is just around the corner) and got the information we needed. Back to the room - in order to get into the room, they give you an actual key....and only 1. You also get a card to turn on the lights. Don't understand why you need two methods for the room. Upon entering the room, we could immediately detect a musty odor and had to open the window. The smell came from the bathroom - see the pictures I uploaded of the horrid bathroom. The bathroom was so nasty. Mold, mildew, fungus, water stains everywhere. Broken equipment and things falling apart. The shower curtain had mildew on it. Great hotels don't use shower curtains anymore. The shower did have good water pressure, but since there was a curtain, the floor got completely soaked...flooded even. And the hair dryer was a piece of machinery out of the cold war era. I couldn't use it very long as it would get so hot I couldn't hold it. The bed was very hard and the beddings were rough like sand paper. The rug was dark, smelly, and very worn. The furniture is worn out too, the walls had damage and were filthy....and there was a faint smell in the room of cigars or cigarettes. There's inadequate ventilation in the bathroom, so you had to open the window in the bedroom to air it out. That's lame...especially if you were to stay there in the midst of winter. There's a speaker in the bathroom that's connected to the TV. But there's no volume control - only on the TV set. So if you have the TV on in the room, you have to turn the volume down to a point where you can barely hear it because the volume in the bathroom was too loud. Also lame. I also found the room to be too dark despite the large window. Sort of depressing, really. There were no extra electrical outlets and the outlets they did have were not at a decent height - all located near the floor. So if you had to charge a battery pack...you had to unplug a lamp. and when you unplugged a lamp...the room got even darker so more depressing. The only good thing about this hotel is that we were only booked into it for 3 days. Trust me on this folks, stay away from this hotel...it's a complete waste of your hard earned money.", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service\u201d", "Author": "jodilew", "ReviewID": "UR10144533", "Content": "The Hotel Splendide Royal is Rome was superb.

We were originally booked at the Excelsior on the Via Veneto but after reading the reviews on this site we changed our reservation to the Spendide. This turned out the be the biggest (and luckily the only) mistake on our recent 2 week vacation. I just looked at receent reviews and the one person who dogged this hotel got it right. We had almost the same experience. The day manager (or whatever he is) is a mess and shouldn't be at the desk of a supposed 5 star hotel. We booked a suite via the website. The option told us we may or may not have a balcony. We wrote and asked specifically for the balcony as it was our 20th anniversary. When we arrived, we were told our suite didn't have a balcony, that we specifically selected a suite without a balcony and if we wanted one it would cost extra (the room was already $1,000 a night!!). They were willing to give us a regular deluxe double with a balcony but for the same price. WHen we got to the room, it was three small connected rooms in the center of the building overlooking an alley. No one seemed to care we didn't like our room. The day manager was rude and challenged us on the reservation we made on their website!! In the room, the front door didn't shut. The manager told us to just leave and go out -- no one would take our stuff. When we wouldn't go out, we waited an hour for someone to fix it (they told us it would take 5 minutes). Finally, 2 1/2 hours later after serveral calls to the desk and serveral lies from them, we moved to a new suite with a balcony that was attached to the roof thus other could come down onto our balcony. In this room, with a tiny bathroom for a suite, one of the toilets continually ran. The manager then had the nerve to ask my husband to write a letter to the general manager, who threatened to fire him for not helping us properly. We were supposed to tell the general manager that we didn't mind what happened!!! Everything else was a distaster -- the restaurant on the roof (La Mirabelle) messed up our reservation. By the way, this restaurant is way overpriced for what it is -- a Michelin 1 star with a great view. If you want a better dining experience in Rome, go to Agata y Romeo, a family run 1 star or the 3 star restaurant at the Hilton. Transportation to the airport was a problem, reservations we asked for ahead of time were messed up. The day manager consistently blamed a concierge who \"happens to be out today.\" We travel alot in Europe, we always stay in great hotels and I can say with confidence, this was one of the worst experiences we have ever had.

The lobby area looked fantastic, very elaborately furnished ancient Rome style, all marble. Elevators were a bit of a tight squeeze, six people absolute maximum. The hotel was spotlessly clean, but considering the price, i would have expected nothing less. Rooms were large by European standards, the extra large bed, was actually two queen beds pushed together. We found the mattresses to be very firm, a lot harder than we are used to, that coupled with the hollow fibre pillows, and the sunken glowing ceiling light, that i didn't know how to turn off, didn't allow us a good nights sleep. I found out with one night left, that there was an alternative feather pillow available, so it was my own fault for not asking. Turndown service, un-necessary if you ask me, there are better ways to show you care about your customers. For business clients, the room had high speed internet access, with wireless capabilities, and also web access through T.V. or via P.C. in the lobby.

The location was spot on, right on the south perimiter of Villa Borghese, two minutes from Via Veneto restaurants and only five minutes from the Spanish Steps.

It was expensive but excellent quality. We booked late and we were only able to book a superior room which is the standard room. We need not have worried as the room was furnished and equipped to the same level as the other rooms. The only difference is the size of the room (which was about the size of standard London hotel rooms)and the lack of view. By the time we got back into the room at the end of a tiring day we did not need the view and appreciated the quiet location at the back of the hotel. The standards of service were excellent. The bathroom was big and very comfortable with everything you could possibly need. We could not afford to eat in the hotel restaurant although we might return for a special occasion such as an anniversary because it is a very romantic setting. We did however go onto the terrace each evening after returning from dinner for a coffee or a nightcap. The cost has to be put aside (dont even think about it) because the memories will be priceless and stay with you forever. The candle lit terrace overlooking Rome on a warm evening is one of the memories I will treasure most from our visit. Breakfast was very good, nothing was too much trouble for the staff, and the views were a joy. I am pleased we chose this hotel because it felt very Italian and was top quality.It was better than staying in a corporate hotel which could be in any city in the world.

The entrance to the hotel is very nice but when you enter it is like a jewel box. The chandelier in the reception is fabulous & was used by Visconti in 'The Leopard'. The decor & furnishings are beautiful in typically high Italianate style with everything of the best quality. I saw no evidence of the 'fraying around the edges' mentioned by a previous review although there are some distressed paint effects on some of the modern fittings which is entirely in keeping with a building of this age & style. We were staying in a Junior Suite (with a huge terrace overlooking the Borghese Gardens) which is best described as sumptuous with lavish furnishings & drapes & I loved the silk wall panels. The ceiling was almost dome-like with fabulous mouldings. A wonderful marble bathroom, jacuzzi & a walk-in shower so large could almost be described as a wet-room in the UK (but not US). Very luxurious toiletries. Huge King bed which was actually 2 paired doubles. I though the pure linen sheets were heaven to sleep on, I would compare to the best Egyptian cotton. So the hotel itself is beautiful but the jewel in the crown are the staff & therefore the service. The concierge & reception staff are exceptional & provide such a very personal & warm service, always greeted by name. It was my birthday during my stay & a bottle of Italian 'champagne' in a silver ice bucket with a tray of nibbles was delivered to us on the evening when we were getting ready for dinner. So a glass of bubbly whilst luxuriating in the jacuzzi was lovely! On our last day we had an evening flight home & we were offered a complimantary late check out which was very helpful (of course this was out of season & the hotel fairly quiet but nevertheless a great kindness to us). We did dine once in the Mirabelle restaurant which is breathtaking with its spectacular views & impeccable service. The food was of course excellent. Yes it is high-end price wise but no more expensive than the equivelent in UK but you would not have that view. You could keep the cost down if you so chose by avoiding the champagne cocktails & maybe going for a house wine but a matter of personal taste (we didn't!) As for location & the aforementioned hill, from earlier reviews I was expecting to be scaling Everest daily but in fact no problem at all & the views from the hotel are worth it. We have visited Rome several times before but not stayed in this location & I was surprised by how convenient it was & very peaceful, even at night when, due to very mild weather we slept with the french doors to to the terrace open & had no noise disturbance whatsoever (I am a light sleeper). So don't worry about the hotel being on a road, although it may be busier in the summer. I must address a point made in an earlier review regarding breakfast. Our experience differed from this as the day of our Scavi tour we needed a very early start (the hotel did not know this) & tried our luck a little before the offical opening time when we found everything ready. I found what was on offer to be fine. I like a healthier breakfast & this offered the best range of fruits I have had in any hotel outside of the tropics. I enjoyed breakfasting on fresh strawberries whilst gazing at St Peters' & the Medici Palace (the view from the breakfast room is again, breathtaking).

A benefit of having a courtyard view is a decent nights sleep. Be aware that a lot of roads in Rome are cobbled so the traffic noise can be terrible. The hotel is in a great position for getting around and seeing the sights, but like many of the upmarket hotels on or near the Via Veneto, its at the top of the hill, so ladies, leave your heels at home. The top floor has a rather swish restaurant and a good bar. The breakfast room too has good views across the city.

On arrival, the receptionist was extremely helpful - gave us a map of the city and pointed out places of interest. The hotel isn't especially eye catching from outside but there is always a doorman on duty. It's location is very good - 5/10 mins from Spanish Steps and 5/10 mins from Piazza Barberini and Via Veneto. We had booked a \"superior\" room which is the hotel's standard room. The room itself was very nice - well decorated but not particularly large and it didn't have a very nice view over the rear of the hotel. There was a large wardrobe but not much drawer space. It had a flat screen TV and mini bar (very expensive!) and a very nice bathroom with double sink, bath with shower over and bidet. To be honest, I've stayed in a less expensive hotel in Rome previously where the rooms were larger and as nicely decorated however I found it was the little touches that made this a nicer hotel to stay in. The bed sheets were linen, there were robes and slippers, the turndown service was good - all towels replaced and sweets left together with the following days weather forecast and the complimentary toiletries were decent quality! We did have a problem with the heating in our room and it did get sorted but only after asking a second time which was unfortunate. The reception area was very opulent although away from the main reception room there were no windows but lots of comfortable chairs and tables and two internet stations. The American bar was nice but quite small. Lots of the tables were outside and although it was November when we stayed it was nice to sit outside because there were heaters on and there is a fabulous view across the city to St Peters. Price wise it was a little expensive - the beers were 10euros, the cocktails between 14 and 20 euros and the cheapest bottle of wine I found was 40euros. When you ordered drinks however you did get savoury nibbles with them pre dinner and sweet nibbles after dinner. We didn't eat in the restaurant but it looked very nice and didn't seem as expensive as we had anticipated - starters beween 15 and 25 euros and main courses around 40 euros. I wish we had had time to have a meal there as I think it would have been a nice treat. We did eat in the restaurant next door to the hotel on our first evening when we arrived late and it was very good - good service, good food, decent wine and a very reasonable price plus, when we went back for lunch on our last day they treated us like old friends! The breakfast in the hotel was decent - good choice of fruit, cereal, meat and cheese as well as bacon, scrambled eggs and sausage. There was an 8euro supplement to have breakfast in the room and this was just for basic continental - didn't even include juice - anything over and above the basic cost extra. The breakfast is served from 7am to 10.30am so it's great if you like a lie in! There is a gym in the hotel but we didn't manage to take a look. All in all I think the hotel was very nice and I think it was worth the money.

We arrived and apart from my husbands shock at seeing the top hatted porters outside, where he nearly turned on his heels and ran in the opposite direction, we got checked in really quickly and smoothly. A porter showed us to our room and actually didn't wait for a tip at all. The room was beautiful, exactly how they look on the hotesl web site and my husband started to relax!! Simply put, it felt luxurious and was exactly what we had hoped for. The only slight let down, which did not actually matter, was that the room we got was one of the rooms facing the inner 'courtyard' (the emergency staircases). We arrived mid morning and literally dumped our bags to go sight seeing and shopping(excellent location close to the spanish Steps and via Veneto) and didn't arrive back till around 5pm when it was dusk. We snoozed for a few hours and then went out to dinner, in the rain, which made it all seem so romantic. so in the end, the rooms view was not a factor at all. The sheets and cover on the bed felt beautifully luxurious and not paper like or hard as described in some peoples reviews. We slept like babies. Breakfast was beautiful with the view over Rome and there was lots of choice from hot stuff to the truly Italian breakfast, which my husband appreciated given he is Italian. The hotel staff were all really friendly and made us feel at ease. We only stayed the one night as we live only a few hours drive from Rome, and as mentioned before, it was a treat to ourselves for a particularly busy time at work and time away for us as a couple - children were left at home for this one.

All my wife knew was that we were going to Italy and I took care of the rest. Suffice to say, she was blown away when we arrived. Splendide is a beautifully decorated hotel with great views of Villa Borghese. A couple of minutes from the Spanish Steps and Via Veneto. We were cordially welcomed by the staff (especially Fabiola and Mario). The deluxe room was on the fifth floor overlooking Villa Borghese \u2013 it had a terrific little balcony and a gorgeous bathroom lined with white and black marble. We were welcomed with a bottle of Prosecco on our arrival which was very thoughtful. Breakfast was your standard Continental breakfast but I thought the selection of food was great. There\u2019s plenty of choice to get your day started right (eggs, fruit, toast, juices, yogurt, caffe latte, nutella!). The proximity of the hotel to the major sites is a big plus although it must be noted that you should have decent walking shoes and be in good shape to take full advantage of Rome. There just too much to see and traveling by foot is the way to go. However, you can easily find cabs or ride the orange transit buses to most locations. We just loved Rome \u2013 it\u2019s almost surreal. The beautiful piazzas (Navona, Spagna, Campo del Fiore, San Pietro), the stunning architecture of Pantheon, Coliseum and St.Peter\u2019s, the awesome Fontana di Trevi. And then there\u2019s the rest of the city which is just teeming with living history. We even saw the Pope who has a papal audience on the first Wednesday of every month. It was great every night walking to our \u201chome away from home\u201d, the Splendide. We would always pass by the Spanish Steps and hang out for a gelato or roasted chestnuts before making the last 5-minute hike home. I originally found out about the Spendide Royal on Trip Advisor and I was certainly not disappointed. You are always going to find some people that were disappointed for one reason or another. You will always have expectations, especially when you are spending a lot per night. However, Rome is generally very expensive (as is Venice) so you must compare locally and not to what you get for that money in North America.

I was deliberating between a taxi and the bus and got the distinct impression that they had an arrangement with a car company and highly dissuaded me from taking a bus/metro service. It was much more expensive than taking a airport bus service; but at least it was safe. The hotel rooms were very clean, with nice appointments, as well as quiet. By far, the most wonderful thing about this hotel is having either breakfast or dinner on the top floor. It over looks Rome as well as Rome's equivalent to Central Park.

We arrived at 9am and the staff was nice enough to allow us to check into our room several hours early, a nice suprise. The room is very small and uncomftorable. We had a beautiful view of an interior wall! (Five stars? Put some flowers out there or something - a horrific view). Our two main complaints were 1. the lack of facilities to relax after a long day (both in and outside of the room); and 2. the unbelievably stiff bed with starched paper for sheets (with a rip in the comforter which conveniently was the same comforter for three nights in a row). A previous post mentioned sweets on the bed was a nice touch, don't get too excited - you get two jelly candies in a little cardboard box. The mini-bar prices are ludicrous! Eight euro (10 USD) for a 12 ounce coke. Twelve euros (15 USD) for mini cocktail bottles. We went to a local market and bought our own water and wine and saved an incredible amount. The breakfast was average. Nice view, nice spread, but if you want a cup of coffee you can get up and get it yourself. The staff is not 5 star standard. I was very frustrated with their lack of attention towards something as simple as coffee in your cup. And if you want cream in your coffee good luck. Everyone raves about the hotel restaurant. We did not eat there. Take a look at the menu and you'll understand. There is absolutely NO reason to eat there. We ate at a different restaurant every night and had an excellent meal, value, and experience at all. You cannot convince me that the hotel restauant food merits a 200 euro total price tag compared to the other places we ate at. Save your money and explore Rome by night. And definately do not listen to the doorman's recommendation for a restaurant. He put us in a taxi and sent us to the most bland, boring restaurant down an alley. We ignored his advice and found Alfredos up the street and had a great experience. The doormen try most of the time, but are often two busy to spin the door for the ladies. They were shocked to hear that we wanted directions to walk to the colliseum. I asked directions and they told me it couldn't be done. What do you mean it can't be done? We enjoy walking, and actually seeing the cities we visit. They insisted we take a taxi. Eventually he pointed us in the right direction which was a 35 minute walk - a nice 35 minute walk.

In my best Italian I protested and his English suddenly stretched only to \"it was in kilometers\". My travelling companion coughed up inspite of my protests, and still the driver continued the con. He switched a 50 Euro note for a 10 and tried to tell us that we'd only given him 40 Euros. At which point we got out.

In summer there's a fabulous terrace with views. We had a room at the back of the hotel so there was no road noise (a common complaint in Rome). However we were surrounded by the backs of other hotels which had continuous loud aircon units whirring away (only noticeable with the windows open). Not a problem if you sleep with earplugs. Fantastic limo service to the airport. When you book from the UK it's quoted as 90Euros. When you return it drops to 65Euros. We booked the latter and didn't regret it. Bad points: Everyone says \"ooh it's near the Spanish Steps so it's well located\". What they fail to tell you is that it's at the top of the Spanish Steps and then up a loooong hill. The area is devoted to tourists and is therefore soul-less, and the restaurants reflect this. A better bet would be to stay at the bottom of the steps at least, or preferrably a bit further south still. Even better would be to be in Trastevere where at least there is a bit of local flavour.

The hotel is spotlessly clean, all the staff are very polite and helpful in a sincere way rather than because they expect a tip. Deluxe Rooms and Suites overlook the Villa Borghese park and you should try to ensure you get a room on at least the 5th or 6th floor to take full advantage of the views. Room 507 is I think the only deluxe room in the hotel that has a small balcony and is worth getting if you don't want to pay for a suite. Dinner at the roof terrace restaurant, Mirabelle, is a must. For two people this will cost anything in the region of 200 - 300 Euros but, believe me, worth every penny. Breakfast is very good with a wide choice of fresh fruits, cheeses, meats, pastries as well as bacon, sausage and eggs. On the downside like previous reviews have mentioned, the bed linens are not the most comfortable and their poor quality does let down what is otherwise a fabulous hotel. The only other improvement would be the addition of a bar on the ground floor - a place to relax and enjoy a drink at the end of the day. The bar adjoining the roof terrace restaurant is too small and too formal to meet this requirement. Other good restaurants include: Papa Baccus, Via Toscana, 5 minutes walk from the hotel serving Tuscan dishes. Their speciality beef is excellent. Dinner will cost around 90 - 100 euros for two. If you are close to the Roman Forum do have lunch at \"To Fly\", Via di Sant Eufemia (Piazza Venezia). They serve a fabulous buffet lunch for just 9 euros and the staff are great. One restaurant to avoid at all costs unless you want to be ripped off is La Tavernetta Ristorante, 147 Via Sistina - just 5 minutes from the hotel. This guy cleverly seduces you into ordering dishes that are not priced on the menu then hits you with an outrageous bill. For example, lunch for two consisting of a bowl of average pasta and a side salad, 73 euros. You would be better off emptying your wallet into the street and letting the locals help themselves! Finally, if you want to pre-book a transfer from the airport to your hotel, try Romeinlimo ([--], e-mail: [--]) You won't have to give any credit card details when you book, just pay on the day.

We paid GBP 923 for two people with breakfast inc all taxes through a special offer with Expedia (flights not included). A standard room would have cost us about GBP 550, and a deluxe about GBP 675 in January/February. Location 4/5 The Splendide is located close to the Via Veneto, facing the Villa Borghese Park (well worth a visit). Many of Rome's top hotels are concentrated in this area - The Eden, Westin Excelsior, Palace Boscolo, Majestic. It's a good and fairly central location, slightly outside the very heart of the city and quieter for it. It's position on raised ground gives good views of the park and some (limited) views of Rome's roof tops from the 5th floor where the suites are located. The nearest attraction is the Spanish Steps, about a 10 minute walk, where you will also find the metro station. Other attractions are, Trevi Fountain (15mins), Pantheon (15/20mins), St Peters/Vatican (30/40mins) Coliseum (30/40mins), all depending on route. To be honest there's not much happening in the immediate vicinity. Things are livelier 5 minutes away at the Via Veneto which has a small selection of restaurants, but for choice and better value you're better off wandering the streets at the foot of the Spanish Steps which are a good 10 minute walk. Hotel 4/5 A medium/large hotel with smallish but very nicely finished communal areas. It's very Italian in style but not so grandiose as to make you feel uncomfortable if you're not dressed in Channel couture. That's the nice thing about the Splendide, smart but not snobby and we didn\u2019t feel ashamed in trainers which are essential for those long sightseeing days. Guests were predominantly English with some Italian businessmen (although tourist couples made up the bulk of guests, Splendide does not have the air of a business hotel), heard a few French voices and one American, but no Japanese. Staff 5/5 Friendly and welcoming. Everyone was pleasant and discrete and my requests both pre-check-in and during the stay were all met professionally and without problem. We didn't use the concierge. The doormen were charming and organised taxis quickly and efficiently for us. Also they didn't insist on a hotel limo to the airport like many of these 5* hotels often do - they found us a 40 euro standard taxi back to Fiumicino airport. Room 5/5 On our arrival a complimentary box of beautiful Italian chocolates was waiting for us, and every evening a mini box of 2 fruit sweets was also left on turn-down. Junior suites are well appointed, if not quite as huge as promised by those 360 degree photo shots - oh and those walls, that's not wallpaper, it's stretched fabrics - classy. Our room had a large private terrace with a table/chairs and views over the park, a shame it was too cold to really appreciate this but I can imagine that during the warmer summer evenings this would be a wonderful way to spend an evening. Best room feature was a Jacuzzi bath with lots of controls to soothe those aches after a long day's sightseeing. TV with BBC World for brits, CNN/ABC for Americans and TV2/TV5 for the French. A small selection of movies at 14 euro each also available, with a massively overpriced minibar if you want to stay in and have money to burn. Climate control seemed to work well, but as it was cold during our stay can't speak for the air cooling element. The bed was absolutely huge, firm but comfortable and dressed in linen which was not just made but changed everyday - what a treat, crisp/clean linen every night! In fact the room was immaculate, exceptionally well cleaned and even the umpteen chrome fixtures and fittings in the bathroom were all spotless and sparkling, as was all the glass. As you have to place your room key card in a slot on entry the staff know whether you're in or out, so you\u2019re guaranteed that every time you come back to the room it's been tidied/cleaned, made sure towels are renewed and bathroom stocks replenished. The bathroom was large and finished in marble, twin sinks, separate standup/sitdown shower and a bidet. Water pressure and hot water were adequate. Freebies included their own brand (but very nice) bath foam, bath salts, shampoo, body lotion, vanity set, sewing kit, shoe shine and slippers. The only minor disappointments were, no trouser press and no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. We like to pop back to the hotel mid/late afternoon for a break/rest and a cuppa - if you wanted to do that you'd be forced to pay 7-9 euros for a room service coffee. Room service was available and not wildly overpriced either, considering that the hotel houses the Mirabelle, one of Rome's most highly regarded restaurants. Outside a two course meal with wine was averaging us 50/60 euros - you're probably talking 80/90 euros for the same in-room (without wine, but easily bought outside) and with a lovely terrace to eat on I can imagine this as being a very pleasant way to spend a warm romantic evening. Breakfasts 4/5 Great views from the 6th floor breakfast room where you can enjoy breakfast between 6:30AM and 10:30AM. Must be lovely in the summer when they open up the sides as in the winter it's tented. The buffet wasn't large but adequate. Hot food is limited to scrambled egg, sausage & bacon - very good too - perhaps they could do other hot foods on request but we didn't ask. A selection of cereals, fresh cut fruit, cheeses, yogurts, cold meats, breads, pastries and cakes meant that although the spread wasn't nearly as large as those offered by some hotels I've stayed in, there was actually ample choice for virtually all palates. Overall 4.5/5 Can't fault the hotel itself, and a junior suite is a real treat especially at the price we paid - bargain. Would I stay here again? Possibly. Why only possibly? For me personally I like to be right in the thick of it, there's nothing better than looking out the window and taking in the bustling city from a hotel in one of the city's central squares. The Splendide does have lovely views of the park and can't be beaten for quiet romance in a fairly central location, but for me it's a bit like staying in London's Marble Arch or on Park Lane, only 1/2 a mile away from Piccadilly Circus and Soho but just not right smack bank in the middle of it all. True it is only 10/15 minutes walk from the Spanish Steps and the restaurants there but after a heavy meal it's a chore to walk uphill for 10 minutes every night to your hotel. OK, OK I'm lazy and I want it all on my doorstep - that's just me - but chances are you'll be rushing around in a short space of time to see all of Rome's sights and that extra 15/20 minutes there and 15/20 minutes back everyday has to be taken into account. Next time I stay in Rome I'll probably go for something close to the Pantheon (we seemed to cross there or near there on our way to/from most of the sights) but if you're younger and fitter than me then the Splendide doesn't lose any points for location. Would I recommend the Splendide, is the question you should be asking, and the answer to that is absolutely! It is a fabulous hotel that ticks so many boxes - it's luxurious without being snobby, it's very close to the heart of Rome but quiet too, it's romantic and has lovely views, the staff are great, it's very clean and very reasonably priced for the standard. Book it without hesitation \u2013 you won\u2019t be disappointed \u2013 and have a great time in Rome \u2013 it\u2019s a wonderful city with a huge amount to offer tourists of all tastes.", "Date": "February 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Ramon, California", "Title": "\u201cIt's a gem!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3101865", "Content": "My husband and I spent 5 nights last November (Thanksgiving week) at the Splendide Royal.

The Christmas lunch at the roof top restaurant Mirabelle was excellent, although not worth 140 euros (ours was part of the package) and the view over the whole city was breathtaking. What really made our stay at the Splendide memorable was Ivan the concierge. There is no information, advice or booking that that Ivan cannot provide. On arrival he surprised us with two free tickets for the midnight Mass at St.Peter which are very difficult to obtain and when my wife left her jacket in the room on departure Ivan had it sent to my home in England and arrived within two days. No wonder he is considered the best concierge in Rome and teaches his profession at one of Rome's top hoteliers school.
