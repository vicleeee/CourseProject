The room was great, the walls appeared to have better insulation from the noise of other rooms and being heighet the noise from thr street was no problem. The breakfast was great, plenty of choice for all tastes! Overall our stay was great.

Comfortable room, nice lobby and breakfast, good internet service. The only complaint was that the keys to the doors didn't work very well - it was always a battle to get in the room and it seemed that the cleaning staff never actually pulled the door shut enough to lock it.

This hotel is 2 minutes from Termini train station, with every sidewalk having a ramp down and ramp up until you get into the station. It is 20 mins walk from the Colosseum and about the same to the Trevi fountain. So conveniently located in 'central Rome' is a good description. If you want peace and quiet. Go to the countryside of Umbria or Tuscany. Then about decor. Like the other hotels owned by this family, (Mediterraneo/Atlantico etc opposite), it is done in the Art Deco style. Hotels only began to be created at the end of the 18th century beginning of the 19th century in Italy. Before this, people on the 'Grand Tour' were mostly nobles, who stayed with friends or family in Italy in Villas and Palaces. There is a guide book in Italian that has a list of all 'historic' locations that are over 100 years old. For example, the Cafe Greco is in it. This hotel is in it too. Having said that, this well maintained, service is excellent. High thread count sheets. 'Standard' buffet breakfast. I look forward to going back.

The rooms were cleaned and security was never an issue (in-room safe provided FOC). WiFi was also included throughout our stay. The only 2complaints I have about the hotel are 1. that the hallways stink of cigarette smoke. When I say stink I mean a strong soaked in stench. They need to implement (and enforce) a no smoking policy in this hotel or limit it to certain floors. Lastly, the included breakfast wasn't great. The eggs were always VERY cold and strange looking.

There were two hot dishes...eggs and bacon, plus cheese, one cold meat, cereal, fruit and bread. The coffee was good and strong. What really stood out at this hotel was the friendliness of the staff. I did not find Romans to be very friendly and in fact, curt on many occasions. However, the staff at the hotel was very courteous, helpful and attentive.

I had been searching for hotels for weeks, and just gave up and chose this one eventually. Boy, what a mistake. Firstly, the problem with getting to the hotel. After forgetting the address to the hotel, we had to resort to taking a cab, because although I knew the hotel was about a minute away, I had no idea which direction I should have gone. We took the taxi, and to my surprise, after about 45 seconds we arrived at the hotel. The hotel was just on the other side of the road, and about a block down. To my surprise, the taxi driver charged 15 EUROS. Yes! For a 45 second drive, 15 EUROS!! Secondly, the problem with checking in. Since the room was already paid for through Expedia, the room was already paid in full. They hotel front desk said they needed a credit card, as well as a phtocopy of our passports. Now, this is the first time i've ever had a copy of my passport taken, in ANY country, and i;ve travelled alot. Anyway, we gave them the passports and they took the photocopies. JUST ONE PROBLEM!.They gave us our room keys and said that was it. Guess What? They never gave us back our passports. Just before walking off, we realised this and asked where the passports were. To my surprise...the passports were hidden under a stack of paper. I was not impressed. This signalled to me that my time in Rome was not going to be pleasant. The room was OK. Nothing spectacular. The furniture was old, and the toilet seemed like something out of medieval times. The bed linen didnt smell clean, and the pillows were flat. The hotel is located right next to a busy street, so in order to reduce noise, try to always keep the windows closed. There are no clocks, and no iron or ironing board. I even got a towel that had a huge hole in it. The area where the hotel is situated, is one where I would advise not to walk at night. Rome citizens are crafty theives. So be extremely careful. In light of this, we decided to order some food, through room service. We had steak, which cost 50 euros a plate. I ordered the steak and asked for it to be well done. The person who took the order apparently was the 'bartender', and when i asked him what came with the steak, he told me 'i dont kno mam, im just the bartender'. When the steak came, it was anything but well done. A piece of red meat with blood coming out as soon as you cut it. It also came with some spinach that was extremely slimy, and some 'bread' which was hard and stale. (Please see the photos I posted to take a look at the meal). Overall, this hotel is a bad choice. Staying here will make the rest of your stay in Rome unpleasant. The hotel provides free breakfast, but i cant comment on it because i didn;t eat it. It didnt look very appetizing. For a nice dinner, just down the road is a restaurant called Roberto's. They serve 3 course meals for 15 euros which is delicious. Also, a good way of getting around Rome is by the hop on nop off tourist bus. It goes to all the sights and you can get off and get back on wherever, you like.

My husband was attending a conference sponsored by an Italian government ministry, so this was our only hotel option. Note: We typically stay on the Vatican side of the Tiber, in a small, family-run hotel. Positives: 1. Everyone seemed very nice and helpful, especially when things were going wrong (which they did quite often, unfortunately). 2. The room was clean, as was the bathroom. 3. Never ran out of hot water, nor were we scalded or frozen to death when someone in another room flushed the toilet. 4. The room was quiet; but we were in the back, facing an air shaft and office building. I, understand, however, from other conference attendees that street noise was a problem in other rooms. 5. The hotel lobby and bar are non-smoking. 6. The breakfast buffet was extensive and well-stocked. Damning with faint praise, aren't I? Negatives: 1. While the small room was expected (this is Rome), the odd decor wasn't. (Although we were warned in another review.) I must agree that the rooms, although recently painted and nicely faux-finished, were filled with furniture which appeared to come from a hotel garage-sale, circa 1965. 2. Many maintenance problems: a. Bathroom ceiling leaked b. Air conditioning stopped working c. Electricity failed d. Room safe nonfunctional While all were fixed promptly, it became tiresome having to call maintenance just about every day of our stay. 3. A room was not available upon our arrival -- at 1545. We were left to cool our heels in the lobby for 45 minutes while a room was found. 4. Problems with the initial reservation. My husband made the reservation for two persons, in a double, non-smoking room approximately one month before our arrival date. When I called to confirm the reservation, I was told that he was assigned a single room for a day later than the arrival date. While management was able to change the reservation (after I was initially told changes were \"impossible\"), my husband had to fax his request to the hotel. I suspect that the contract from the Italian Ministry of Defense had something to do with their willingness to change things. 5. This is a tourist hotel, and is not capable (although it claims otherwise) of supporting business functions. My husband, before an impromptu briefing, asked for Xerox copies of a few pages of documents. He was told it was \"impossible\" and was sent up the street to a tobacco shop. While I fault the organizers of the conference for their selection, a hotel which advertises itself as able to support business affairs should at least be able to make a few copies. 6. There are no \"Do Not Disturb\" cards in the room. I guess it's because the management wants and expects us tourists to be up and at 'em at oh-dark-thirty, but the lack of cards means that one can expect a maid to knock on one's door sometimes as early as 0730. As a matter of fact, the day we departed, the maid knocked at 0730, 0800, 0815, and 0830. No doubt, management was concerned with not having a repeat of the problem mentioned in paragraph 3. 7. While the neighborhood isn't as bad and I'd been warned about, it wasn't great. Much traffic noise and a steady stream of tourists, business people, and others. (Others being a euphanism for rather seedy-looking characters.) The restaurants in the area were of the Let's-Rip-Off-The-Tourist variety (a report provided by other conference attendees - we ate on the other side of the Tiber).

For those that want to go boozing, the best pub we found was the Druids Rock off Via Cavour, opposite Santa Maria Maggiore.", "Date": "September 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cOK, but not the best\u201d", "Author": "PuffinMarine", "ReviewID": "UR3841504", "Content": "Good location, large clean rooms, good breakfast.

I've read through some of the reviews and some I find quite unfair, OK the rooms adjacent to the surrounding rounds can be noisy and sometimes you do feel like Michael Flatterly is doing a river dance in the room above but this hotel is over 120 years old, built long before buses and coaches rumbled up and down via Cavour and when wooden flooring was all the rage. They have tried as best they can to eliminate noise but I feel that if they did anymore then the beauty and character of the hotel would diminish. Rooms can be small but as I overheard one American tour guide explain to her party \"Each room is different, some big some small\". The best advice I can offer would be to try and get a room on the top floor on the innerside of the building but if noise isn't a problem then I'd go for a room alongside via Cavour, lots of things happen along this road such and it's nice to people watch out of the MASSIVE windows. Firstly I must say that I think the Hotel is a bit understaffed but having said that the staff that they have are wonderful, friendly and extremely hard working, the latter being something very rare in Rome as anybody who has spent enough time here will know only too well !!!! The bar is very nicely decorated and well stocked. Giuliano & Angellino are a couple of cheeky chappies who'll look after you at the bar, they are very friendly, always willing to chat. During the Summer months residents are encouraged to go over the road to the sister hotel \"The Meditterano\" and make use of their 10th floor roof garden, it's the highest panoramic viewing point in the whole of Rome and simply a beautiful place to relax and have drinks in the evening. The food in the Restaurant is some of, if not the best I have had in Rome (certainly in the area) as is the (silver) service. They have an a la Carte menu as well as a daily menu, and they use the freshed and best ingredients. It's maybe a little bit more pricier than some of the surrounding eateries it is certainly excellent value for money. Plenty of class. Yes the Breakfast is basic but that is the same for any other Hotel that I have spent time in during my stay in Rome, also when the Hotel is full the staff in the breakfast rooms seem to be rushed off their feet and you may need to wait a while why a table is cleared for you, not too much a hardship I think. The location is brilliant, right by Termini Station and all sights are very easily to get to. The area however is a bit grotty, like most of Rome there is Graffiti all over the place and not even good Graffiti, if there is such a thing, for a city so rich in art and culture you'd expect a bit to rub off on the vandals. Should I ever return to Rome on business or pleasure would I stay here? Absolutely, without question. Feel free to email me if you require anymore information, I can point you in the right direction for some nice restaurants, wine bars and pubs. Last piece of advice for anybody travelling to Rome - Only get in a Taxi that has the red \"Commue di Roma\" sticker on the outside, these are governed Taxi's, the name of the driver and the number of the taxi should be on a small plaque on the inside of the passenger doors, you should also find some information in the taxi detailing the payment structure, once inside the GIR (Roman Ring Road) the tariff should always be on option 1, let the driver know that you are aware of this and save yourself plenty of Euros.", "Date": "July 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois, USA", "Title": "\u201cUhhhh\u201d", "Author": "sannasun", "ReviewID": "UR3311739", "Content": "Just returned from 1 day stay at Massimo D'Azeglio. LOCATION: Its a basic hotel close to Stazione Termini. Two metro lines meet at Termini providing easy access to tourist sights from the hotel. ROOM: I stayed in a single room. It was just basic with very little storage space in the room and bathroom. The room was very small even to European standards and bathroom was worse. The bed and sheets have a worn look and were terrible. STAFF: I didn't have enough opportunity to form an opinion about the staff. They seemed friendly at check-in and check-out. FACILITIES: The hotel provided computer has free high speed internet access in the lobby. The rooms does NOT have WiFi (high speed wireless internet) access. There was a lousy ancient TV in the room. Noticeably missing was BBC from the channel lineup. To SUM UP, I'd rate the hotel as 2 star per U.S. standards. The hotel location and price made me reserve there.
