I had booked three double rooms and one triple for some friends of mine for our annual weekend away. However, at last minute one of my friends was unable to come. When I arrived at the reception, I told the receptionist we wouldn't need a third bed in one of the rooms and he promptly removed it from our invoice for the weekend. This was a most welcome and pleasant surprise. The hotel itself is much the same as before, in that it is smart, very clean and perfectly located for a great weekend in Barcelona. You are 5 minutes walk from Las Ramblas and 2 minutes from the marina. The rooms are all in good order and I would highly recommend this hotel as a place to stay. A little tip for getting there: If you are flying in to Barcelona BCN Terminal 2, don't waste money on a taxi unless you have a lot of heavy bags. Take one of the many blue buses outside the terminal. They will have A2 on the front display panel. A return ticket (valid for 9 days) is \u20ac9.15. It is approximately a 15 minute ride to the last stop which is Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya. From here you walk straight down Las Ramblas (which is a real eye opener if you've never been) and take the very last left before you get to the roundabout (which has a 60 metre high Columbus monument on it, so you can't miss it). The street is called Carrer Ample and it is 5 minutes down there on the left, just past a beautiful old church. In all, it is a really enjoyable 15 minute walk from where the bus drops you off.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel.

My girlfriend and I were visiting Barcelona for the first time. Only problem was that our flight did not get in until after midnight, and we did not want to spend money for a complete day at a hotel if we were just going to sleep for about 7 hours. Our plan was to arrive at the Hesperia Metropol reception sometime around 1:00 a.m. and beg them to hold onto our luggage until they could should check us into our room that afternoon during traditional check-in hours. Mary at the front desk was a complete doll. She could see we were exhausted from traveling and took mercy on us. She booked us into our room a full 12 hours in advance of the usual check-in time. She saved us from a long night and an early morning of 5 Hour Energy bottles, endless cups of coffee and numerous cans of Red Bull. We got into our room around 1:30 a.m. and slept until morning with complete comfort. If not for Mary, we would have never gotten our body clocks right. We were able to wake up at a decent hour and really explore the city to its fullest. We were in room #110 and this was very nice, but the air conditioning left something to be desired. The ceilings were high and there was plenty of closet space. But there was absolutely no view. The only window in the room faced out toward an enclosed landing. The bathroom was nice with a big tub. They put out complimentary soaps and bath gels and even toothpaste, which was a real bonus as we were officially out of it by that point in our trip. Hot and cold water worked well. There was a fridge but nothing could be put inside of it because the hotel had filled it with all the things they had hoped to sell. I also don't think it was turned on because everything inside was luke warm at best. The real beauty of this hotel is the location. It can be tough to find Carrer Ample if you are using public transportation and arriving after midnight. Somehow we did. But the Hesperia Metropol's proximity to Las Ramblas (the main drag) and the beach made it worth the price. You are a five minute walk from the beginning of Las Ramblas. You are also a twenty minute walk from the beach. The train is also about ten minutes away. There are many restaurants and bars nearby. There is a very young demographic which stays out very late in Barcelona. They gave me and my girlfriend a perplexed look when they saw us carrying our luggage in on a Tuesday night. There is no free computer for guests to use. If you want to check your email or surf the net, you have to pay to use the computer in the lobby. This is not all bad, but it seems like a cheap way to make a few extra bucks. The hotel can be easy to miss as all the buildings are pretty close together and little sunlight makes its way onto the street. But if you are like us, you are not going to spend a majority of your time in a hotel room when you have the lovely city of Barcelona beckoning for you to take advantage of it.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Port Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel- price was right- walking distance of Ramblas and Marina-but...\u201d", "Author": "Cinnamon504", "ReviewID": "UR116135377", "Content": "Price was right for this hotel- $140 including tax for 3 days and got breakfast too!

The staff was helpful and the internet cafe worked well- you pay by the minute so you may want to keep \"web talk\" brief.

We had picked this hotel and a few weeks later, after reading the reviews, I seemed to work myself up into panic-mode, after hearing about stolen money and the neighborhood of the hotel. Well, I can honestly say that my fears were VERY quickly put aside once we got there. The staff was VERY helpful and friendly, eager to map out our next destination for us. As for the room, yes, it was small, but our days really were spent sight-seeing and except to sleep we werent in it. Location - you cant top it. It is right, smack dab, in the middle of the action! OK, OK, now I wouldnt be fair if I didnt list a few negatives here. The worst part of this hotel was the smells on the ground floor. I believe that this place is built on a dump or sewer line that filters into the main lobby. We stayed on the fourth floor, so it didnt bother us there, only when we walked in. Another negative would be the proximity to the next building. As we looked out of the window, we could see right into the apartment across from us. (we had to be only ten feet away!) But this aside, the stay was very pleasant, and we'd be back again. As far as Barcelona, a few words of advice. Keep valuables in the hotel safe. We didn't lose anything, but at the flea market, my wife's bag was slashed hoping something would fall during a crowded section. Another word of advice is get your metro pass for 10-rides rather than individually.

We took the room at the front w/the Juliet balcony and I have to agree with other reviewers, it is VERY NOISY.

I wanted to upload fotos from my digital camera and their computer was something I used in high school that didn't read the USB and no media slot! Stick to the Internet Cafe that was on adjacent to the rambla next to their plaza in the middle of the Ramblas. Their PCs were modern. The cheapest one was on the Ramblas next to the Subway. 1.80 euro for an hour. Travel within Spain, book via Spainair, Vueling or Easy Jet. They are the cheapest. We flew from Madrid for 60 euros. Sweet! The location was a long walk to the Metro. I would never stay at the place. The halls smelled of mildew and the linens must be washed in something horrible as my skin itched the whole day. Definitely stay along the Ramblas or up by Placa Catalunya! Their fotos look nicer than the real thing!", "Date": "November 24, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hesperia Metropol", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d228479-Reviews-Hesperia_Metropol-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$99 - $190*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Ample 31</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08002</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "228479", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d2/65/d2653566a9b68b80d2bb677fe073691e5large.jpg"}}
