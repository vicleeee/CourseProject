Amazing beds! huge, luxurious, fantastic sleep quality. The 'train carriage' themed bar is quirky but very welcoming after a full day's treading the Dutch streets. Typically for Amsterdam it's expensive to eat and drink in the hotel but there are excellent bars and restaurants in the area so go and explore. Although it's not cheap it really is good value for money. Only 10 minutes walk from the train station and very easy to find. A hidden gem which I wholeheartedly recommend. Tip - take the train from Schipol airport to Amsterdam. Easy, inexpensive and direct. Tip 2 - buy a tram travel pass opposite the train station. Excellent value for money, easy to use and a great way to see all the sights.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cexcellent location\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR128321881", "Content": "We stayed at the Convent Hotel for two nights.

We chose the hotel as my husband had stayed there on a previous trip and found the hotel very comfortable and centrally located. The hotel was easy to get to as it was an easy 5 - 10 minute walk from Central Station and located on a main street. There are also tram numbers 1, 2 and 5 that passed the front of the hotel and stopped nearby. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located in a historic building, former monastery, and has been converted into a medium size hotel. When we arrived we were welcomed at reception and our room was already prepared. Our room was towards the rear of the hotel and we had no problems with traffic noise. The room was clean and comfortable and well decorated with a couple of old style Dutch paintings. We were impressed with the room size for a European hotel as it was quite spacious with a double bed, bedside tables, desk and chair, easy chair, wardrobe and cupboard and flat screen television with a choice of English speaking channels. There was an en suite bathroom with shower over bath and nice complementary toiletries. There was no safe in the room but there was a free safe available at reception. The service from the staff was very good throughout our stay and on the last day we were able to leave out luggage at the hotel and collect it later on in the day. We were booked on a room only basis and did not eat at the hotel although there was the option to have breakfast. We were very impressed with the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s facilitates. There was a large and nicely decorated reception/ lounge area and two lifts. There was the Duke of Windsor Bar which we did not use but when we looked inside it was pleasantly decorated. There was free Wi-Fi but again we did not use this service. The hotel is well located as it is a 5 minute walk to Dam Square and is surrounded by shops, bars and restaurants. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central but on the right side of town, just 2 roads away, from the main canals with about 10 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 15 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk to Anne Frank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s House. Outside the hotel there are 2 tram routes to the Rijksmuseum so it is extremely easy to get about. We had a very enjoyable stay and found the hotel very comfortable and centrally located and well priced. We would have no hesitation in recommending to others or returning ourselves.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "MrTransit", "ReviewID": "UR127906603", "Content": "We had two rooms at the Convent for 4 nights while we stayed in Amsterdam.

My daughters shared a twin-bed room, which was large and filled with light (Rm. 117). Housekeeping was excellent and made sure that we were well-stocked with towels and soaps every day. The front desk was excellent; they were always willing to make recommendations about restaurants and shopping, though they usually recommended places that were too expensive for us. The rooms were quiet, and the business center had 2 computers with Internet access and a printer. One thing about the Convent is that it is convenient. It is right behind Dam Square and near Centraal Station, so most tram lines in the city come within a few blocks. It was an easy walk to the Jordaan, the canals, etc. We found that its location made it easy to visit the sights and then pop back to the hotel to freshen up before dinner, etc. I would highly recommend the Convent and would stay there again if I have the opportunity to visit Amsterdam again.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "kg08953", "ReviewID": "UR127719723", "Content": "Stayed here in March 2012.

Very close to the train station. Tram stop right outside and walkable to most places. We upgraded to a superior room and the room was very charming on the 5th floor with beams on the ceiling. Bathroom a little dated however. Can't comment on the food as I was not going to to pay 23 euros each for breakfast - a right con on my mind. How can a peice of toast and a couple of egss really cost that much. To pay over 40 quid for the 2 of us on breakfast each day - I think not! We had two gripes about the hotel - 1 was the towel we were first left with was dirty. A quick call to reception ensured this was changed and we were given new towels every day for our trip. This was not really necessary as we were happy to reuse the towels again as long as they were clean and used by ourselves only. However a nice gesture. Secondly, and slightly annoying and disspoitingly, the man who comes to check the mini bar was rude. He knocked and let himself into our room without waiting for us to answer. I was not appropriatly dressed and my husband had not even made it to the door to let him in when he barged in. My husband was furious and this man did not even apologise. Very very rude and a let down on the reflection of staff at the hotel. He even had the cheek to blame us for not getting to the door in time (10 seconds by the time it took my hubbie to answer is not long!) and he saw we were charging our mobile phones in the plugs - he said that was not allowed! How on earth can one not be allowed to use the plug sockets for crying out loud. If it wasn't for this man perhaps I would rate the hotel higher. It was something I would not expect from staff at any hotel and leaves a bad taste in our minds. I wonder if anyone from the hotel will read this. Also, tips to note. Walk down about 5 mins to the dam square there is a supermarket where you can buy water/drinks/bread. We made our own breakie each day - we even brought along mini cereal boxes from the uk and bought milk. Save your pennies really!

I have stayed in Amsterdam before and my experiences of the hotels there ranged from grim, to indifferent. I was taking my daughter and two friends, and it's always hard to get things right when booking for other people. I had originally booked another hotel, which was the same price, but more of a boutique hotel and situated in the red light district. My daughter wanted to be in the thick of the action, and the hotel looked really nice from the photos, but thankfully, I had second thoughts and decided to re-read the reviews. It was the one which described a 'sticky white substance' which had appeared on the outside of the bedroom window overnight, which quickly made up my mind, and I cancelled my booking immediately. We passed that hotel during our stay, and I was very glad that I chose sober convent over sticky boutique. The Convent Hotel is an easy walk from the station and is centrally situated for everything you might wish to see in Amsterdam. Our check-in was smooth and pleasant and we were given adjoining rooms, which was great as we had a connecting door. I have read about the decor being tired in the rooms, and admittedly, it is not a boutique hotel, but you are not paying boutique hotel prices. We found the rooms spotlessly clean, tidy and containing everything you might need for a comfortable stay: Lots of new, white towels, great toiletries, bathrobes, and without a shadow of a doubt, the most comfortable beds in Amsterdam, of not the whole of Europe. I'm a bit of a stickler about hotel bedding and hate cheap, foam pillows. The beds at the Convent have mattress toppers, clean, crisp white sheets, which appeared to be brand new, and the softest, most comfortable pillows in Christendom. It was like falling asleep in a cloud. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel as there are a huge number of places to eat within strolling distance. The bar is lovely, and inexpensive if you choose happy hour. But, be warned, any drinks not included on the happy hour cocktail menu are fearfully expensive - double JD and coke = \u00c2\u00a317. In conclusion, we were all delighted with our stay at the Convent Hotel, for it's location, helpful staff, lovely bedding, and very reasonable price. I would recommend this hotel to anybody looking for a really comfortable, peaceful stay in Amsterdam.

The beds were comfortable and easily configured into two seperate twins (by special request ahead of check in, but certainly easy enough for guests to rearrange themselves, since night stands were also able to be moved). The breakfast (free through an Accor promotion) was much better than I expected, with a large selection of hot and cold items and good quality and presentation.

I consider I am qulaified to compare this hotel having stopped at the Krasnapolski, Barbizon Palace and Crown Plaza. There really are some professional moaners on Tripadvisor. We arrived early (12pm) and were welcomed by attentive reception staff who phoned housekeping to ensure our requested room was made available. The room was spotlessly clean, well apointed and with an excellent bed. An Amsterdam room in a 400 year old building will never match the size of an American characterless concrete box - so don't compare (unless of course you have an American 400 year old Holiday Inn to compare to. If I had one comment, it would be that the room lacked natural light. Again, this is due to the age of the building and the surrounding buildings that can obsure the light a little. It caused us no problems and only added to the ambience. But if you feel a moan coming on about a room with diminsihed daylight - don't book the Convent. We stayed on B&B and were amazed at the fantastic breakfast laid on in a delightful dining room, served by friendly, attentive staff. The freshness, quality and range of food was the best I have ever seen in a hotel outside of the Ritz. Its hard to articulate and quantify what I realy liked about the Hotel - but we just felt incredibly comfortable in it. Not too stuffy, informal, relaxing, genuine and just a damn good place to stay. Location is perfect. Ignore stupid comments about massage parlours - there are only a few and they actually are genuine massage parlours. Theres plenty of the other kind in the red light area. You have bars and restaurants within a couple of hundred yards, including Humphreys. As well as a Grashopper \"brown cafe\", supermarket, smart shop, tram stop, car park and everything else you'd need. Its a 5 minute walk from the Central Station and the same again to get you to Dam Square or the Red Light district. Surprsingly, it was really quiet with very little main road traffic and none of the stag/hen party drunks you have to put up with the other central hotels. Reviews have posted complete rubbish about this place, so let me put them straight. You DO NOT have to pay to watch TV. There is a package of games and movies that you can pay 5.95 euros for, but you get over 20 channels free including CNN, BBC etc. The internet is also FREE. Its good as well - I clocked 600mb downstream which is plenty. It may not be good enough for Youtube, but bear in mind it is free and fast. You can have two wireless connections per room.

I stayed in a superior room. The cost averaged 200 Euros a night and although that puts the hotel at the more costly range, I can think of hotels which would charge more for less.

You can choose from a variety of buffet types, from two/three continental selections, to the full hot/cold spread, complete with champagne on weekend mornings. Prices range from around Euro 10/13 up to 22. The hot food could have been a lot warmer though, but I've noticed that's not unusual across the Continent. The location is good....just a short walk from the main train station with its fast links to the airport. Behind the hotel are the main sights, but do venture the other way (westward), where you can find lots of smaller and more reasonably priced bars and restaurants. There is a small business centre off the large lobby, with two PCs and a printer and it was free to use/print off. Great for online check-in when it's time to head home. I would have given this hotel 5-stars, but along with the luke-warm hot buffet choices and the fact that housekeeping left a cart full of dirty bedding in front of the bedroom door for 24 hours, which also blocked one of the escape routes one would need to use, I've had to mark it down by one star.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent", "Title": "\u201csadly going downhill\u201d", "Author": "frequenttraveller94", "ReviewID": "UR119045000", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel 2 years ago booking through a site which let us pay the hotel and booked again because based on that experience, we thought it was good value .

We requested a king bed and a twin or double, as we were all staying in the same room. I researched our hotel exhaustively, read lots of reviews, wanted a very nice hotel where we could all be comfortable in the same room. I thought the price we were paying for this would be a fairly good deal... but that was before I saw the room and the hotel! I can't recommend The Convent highly enough. The room we had was lovely - I've lived in studio apartments smaller than this room! I was expecting \"Euro tiny,\" but it was positively luxurious, one of the nicest hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. Interesting to read other reviewers opinions of what may have been the same room, but we just thought it was amazing. It was on the top floor, the only room on that floor, and it was very clean and well-appointed. I thought the bathroom was fabulous - very large shower with great water pressure and tons of hot water, and a bathtub so large I could practically swim in it! The bathroom itself was larger than some bedrooms I've had in small city apartments! I took a bath there every night. The room was also impressively quiet, given its location within easy walking distance to Centraalstation; we are light sleepers all, and were surprised have slept so deeply in such a busy area of town. Another plus - the windows actually opened, so we could let in fresh air for the very beautiful weather we had at the time. We did not try the hotel breakfasts. We had a fridge and a large table, and were right across the street from a grocery store; we bought local bread and cheese and ate in the room each morning. Great value. However, we did try the hotel bar (great decor!) for drinks and dessert one night: surprisingly reasonable prices for an in-hotel establishment, excellent beer on tap, and a really delicious piece of chocolate cake. They held our luggage for us when we arrived, since we arrived early in the morning, well before we could check in. Our room was ready when it was supposed to be. The internet connection worked beautifully, and their business center with two computers and a printer was also a great resource. (I shouldn't have brought my laptop - there was no need for it, with that business center!) The beds were indeed exceptionally comfortable, and I have a bad back so I'm really sensitive about that. Finally, the service was outstanding. Although I didn't quite agree with the dinner recommendations, when we did run into a couple of real snags and had to make emergency phone calls to the USA - one for a banking situation and once for a pet emergency - they were very accomodating. They were having trouble with their international phone dialing system, or maybe just calls to the USA, but they ended up not charging us for two international calls, because it was a little bit of a hassle to make them. I thought that more than made up for the difficulty. The staff were friendly, approachable, and very professional at all times. Also, we did not take advantage of this perk but I wish that we had - there was a private sauna that guests could reserve for their own use. If the weather had been cold, we would have reserved it, but we were blessed with unseasonably warm and sunny temperatures. If I return to Amsterdam on a pleasure trip, I won't think of staying anywhere else, and I will recommend this hotel highly and without reservation to any friends and family who are planning a trip there.

This hotel has a lot going for it location wise. On a main (but reasonably quiet) street, close to the train station, and just steps from a tram stop that will take you most anywhere you need to go in Amsterdam. Also, the staff was unfailingly polite and helpful. They were patient and (like most Dutch) well versed in English. By European standards, the room was quite spacious. The furnishings had seen better days, but certainly not shabby. The bathroom was cleaned everyday to a luster. The bed was much to my liking but not so much to my wife. The mattress had a feather comforter which you sink into and feels luxurious. There are numerous places to eat nearby and you can get a good, reasonably priced breakfast right next door. Some things that weren't so good: 1) Even though it was near freezing outside at night, the room was often too warm. The bed had only a duvet for cover; no sheet or anything else. The air conditioning had not yet been turned on for the summer and with the duvet over you, waking up in the middle of the night in a sweat was common. The housekeeper, however, was kind enough to leave a sheet in the room for us which we put under the duvet and we slept much better. 2) The evening before we were to leave we went to our room and found two strange suitcases sitting inside the door, belonging to a tour group that had checked in that afternoon. Our things were quite obviously still in the room so why these suitcases were put there remains a mystery. On the up side, the bellman removed them immediately when I notified the desk. We stayed there eight nights and felt we had a very good experience at a reasonable price. It should certainly be considered if you are going to Amsterdam.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cVery good service\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR102710984", "Content": "The service was excellent, the location was fantastic and the hotel was easy to find.

The receptionist was very polite and gave us our room keys (Room 126) which was at the back of the hotel. This suited us very well as it was very quiet.

It's also very close to Ann Frank's house, the red light district, the Amsterdam Sex museum and loads of restaurants and bars.

We arrived at 9.30am and I assumed the room would be available to us at 3pm but no it was ready on our arrival! The staff on reception on so friendly and give you all the maps and advice you need to get around Amsterdam! The room was so nice! Really spacious and clean. Bathroom facilities excellent and the bed was to die for! The most comfotable bed I have ever slept in! The biggest pillows you have ever seen! The Hotel is 5 min walk from Dam Square which takes you everywhere you need to get to on a tram! The hotel sell tickets for everything in Amsterdam all at reduced prices! The Hotel is 10 min walk from central station too which is a bonus! The breakfast buffet was included and was really nice, fresh fruit, cereal, breads, hot buffet, yogurts, even english Breakfast tea! Bar in the hotel is really friendly and comfortable well worth a visit after a busy day for a hot choc with cream! There was a restaurant up the road which is Japanese eat as much as you like called GENROKU. 24 euros and is really gorgeous fresh sushi, hot japanese dishes! You get 5 rounds and can have 5 items per round each and you can choose from 100 items! Examples; Tempura prawns, lamb chops Teriaki, Salmon Maki, Miso Soup, Fresh Salmon Teriaki, selection of hand rolls! Its so fresh and good value, unless you are a sumo wrestler you wont get though 5 rounds! Works on the basis you finish one round before ordering the next which is good because you dont waste any! Things you must see...... Heiniken Experience museum (if not for just a few beers as they are part of the price) Anne Frank Museum (very moving) Red Light District (has to be seen to be believed) Resistance Museum (all about the second world war we spent over two hours in there very interesting Tram 14 or 9 from Dam Square to Plantage Kerklaan opposite the zoo) Canal trip ( lasts an hour from central station, discount with hotel flyer) Enjoy!!!!", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCentrally located, friendly professional staff\u201d", "Author": "Jsrickus", "ReviewID": "UR91206718", "Content": "It wasn't easy to find but we had never been to the dam before and it was dark, once you get your bearings it's very well located!

There really is no view to speak of, and it's quite dark, due the wall that's almost right in front of one of the windows, but it's not a huge issue and we were very happy with the room.

Service from all members of staff (reception, bar, housekeeping, concierge) was friendly and polite. We ordered the 'convenient breakfast' to the room, which costs a very reasonable EUR 9.50 p/p, incl. hot drink, freshly squeezed orange juice and a selection of pastries and baguettes. Even better, there was no sur-charge to have it in the room! We called in the morning and it was delivered 10min later. The only minor downside is the speed of the internet connection.

The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful - veryy happy to direct us around the city and to recommend restaurants (there's an amazing argentinian steakhouse just up the road, for which they can give you a voucher for a free glass of wine and it's amazing!). We had breakfast included, which was decent - the usual buffet breakfast which offered eggs cooked to order and some hot items. We also had a drink in the bar which is like being aboard the Orient Express - very civilised, all decked out in red velvet - nice! The location was the best thing about this hotel - very close to everything and only a short walk from the train station and easy to find. We didn't need taxis/public transport once.

After several nights in humid, overpriced hostels in Switzerland, we arrived at the smart, air conditioned (hooray!) Convent Hotel to be greeted by a wonderfully warm and helpful receptionist who actually looked pleased to see us, rather than just viewing us as another obstacle in her day as so many hotel staff often view their guests. I may as well mention now, that EVERY member of staff we dealt with in this hotel was nothing short of first class in terms of their service to us, whether it was a smile or a joke, we felt very welcome and I can't praise the hotel enough for this. Our room was on the first floor, 135. No street view, but I didn't ask for one, so no complaints at all. The room was cool and surprisingly spacious, with fully adjustable air-con, the decor was pleasant and well-appointed, and everything looked crisp and smelled fresh and clean. There were tea and coffee making facilities, a flat screen tv, a large desk, a chair, a huge comfortable bed with feather pillows and a private bathroom with a hot, powerful shower and great and abundant complementary toiletries. We had an early check out the next day to get to a concert and wanted to leave our rucksacks in the left-luggage facility. The receptionist ordered a bell boy to deal with this for us and it was done so quickly and politely. Upon returning to collect our rucksacks after midnight, we told the receptionist we had some \"left luggage\" to collect to which he remarked \"LOST luggage!!??\" and he gave us a cheeky smile - again, great service and even though we had checked out of the hotel already, he was happy to let us use the bathroom facilities in the reception area to freshen up before our long journey to Germany later that morning. This is the first time I've used a Mercure hotel. I am actually an Accor Loyalty Card holder as I use the Ibis/Etap chains quite a bit back in the UK when I am travelling about and the Mercure's are often a little out of my ideal price range as my requirements from a hotel are very basic (I don't order breakfast/room service/require conference facilities, etc!) but we got the Convent Hotel at a VERY good rate during Accor's 50% off promotion so only paid \u00c2\u00a356 for the night which is pretty incredible for a 4 star hotel in the middle of Amsterdam.

I was attracted to this hotel because it was in a historic building and was centrally located. It turned out to be a nice, restful place to stay, also very centrally located and close to tram lines, Central Station, the RLD, the Singel etc. Unfortunately the building inside is pretty much an ordinary, older hotel and does not convey much of a historic sense except in the lobby and the old-fashioned bar (which is very nice and the bartender gave good service), but the outside is nice to look at. The bed was EXCEPTIONALLY nice and comfortable, a large bed (not two twins shoved together or any of that nonsense) with a lot of extra pillows. My room did not have a view (I had booked one of the less expensive rooms intending to spend most of my time in it sleeping) but looked out on some picturesque rooftops. The bathroom fixtures were not brand new but neither were they ancient. They were pretty clean and worked reasonably well except that the tub stopper did not hold the water in the tub for very long before it all leaked out. The room was pretty clean although I found you have to be careful that the maid doesn't throw out things of yours (such as note papers) on the tables in her hurry to clean up. There is tea and coffee in the room and also a minibar, although it is not \"fully stocked\" unless you buy a higher priced room. (I'm not sure what the point is to that policy as I would have appreciated a better-stocked bar and don't see why I need to book a room that's too huge for me in order to get one, but whatever.) There is also a limited room service so I was able to get some soup and dessert, which was quite good. I did not try the breakfast as I don't like to eat a lot first thing in the morning normally. There is a convenience store (not part of the hotel) just across the alley a few steps from the front door, and also there is a supermarket a few blocks down the street, so you can get bread, cheese, cookies, drinks and that sort of thing and maybe keep some of it in the minibar fridge if you don't want to eat restaurant food all the time. TV was not pay and included all four BBC channels, although no US channels. Internet is pay but if you have a KPN or Tmobile subscription, you can use it to access the wi-fi, so I was able to use my subscription and did not have to pay. Overall this is a nice place and I would definitely consider staying again. The biggest minus for me, aside from the tub that did not work, was the complete lack of a safe in the room.

It feels like a standard 4-star hotel of the kind that businessmen and well-off travellers stay at. The staff were all friendly, accommodating and helpful. No problems there at all. The room was surprisingly affordable when we booked it (considering the quality of the hotel) but then perhaps this is because we booked almost 8 months in advance. The room itself was about 25 sq. metres. So not huge, but not small either. By Amsterdam standards, it was as large a room as one could expect for the price we paid. We had enough room for an armchair. The decor was traditional. The bed was unusually large and comfortable. Lot of pillows, duvet, etc. The smallish bathroom was fine, but not luxurious. Fusion bath goodies. The TV wasn't a flat screen TV. There were only a handful of English stations. Fortunately they had the Comedy Channel, with programming mostly in English. On the weekend that we were there, the internet was free. The breakfast buffet was 22 euros, but they also have breakfast plates for around 12 euros. The buffet was very nice. It had salmon.

I have to say that we had an exceptional time and were treated very well by the courteous and ever helpful staff, especially the young lady who checked us in, and Rob who assisted us when we had an enforced room change. The rooms are a decent size by Amsterdam standards. We were initially given room 204 which is a large classic room overlooking the street. It was a bit noisy into the early hours of the morning with traffic and a few late night revellers outside, but we had asked for a bright and airy room and this fitted the bill. However on the second day of our stay our shower developed a fault which required attention by a plumber. We had to be moved to an alternative room and were very grateful for what turned out to be a luxurious upgrade to room 250. This room had far more space and had a marvellous, walk-in rain shower. (The hotel really should have this professionally photographed and shown on their own website - it was that good !). The bed was enormous, dressed in pristine white sheets and covers, and extremely comfortable. This room also faced the street and had three, floor to ceiling windows which also made it very bright and airy. However it had also been fitted with double glazing which completely eliminated the outside noise. Result ! If I'm being picky there are two things which I feel the hotel could improve on. First of all the gym cannot, by any stretch of the imagination really be called,.......a gym. It consists of 3 outdated fixed pieces of equipment ;- a cycle. a rowing machine, and an abs machine, none of which were worthwhile for anyone expecting a decent workout. Secondly, The Windsor Bar ! This Bar is a wonderfully themed spot to enjoy a few drinks either before heading out for the evening, or for a night cap on the return. It is lovely inside and should really be the first stop for the captive audience, ( the hotel guests!). Unfortunately though, the pricing is a bit steep which appears to have the result of encouraging the guests to look for alternatives elsewhere. We had a nightcap in The Windsor on our first night. The bar was surprisingly empty when we arrived. However when we paid just under 11 euros for a small glass of wine and a small glass of beer we worked out why. This bar is one of the nicest and most luxurious we were in during our stay, and deserves to be full with a thriving guest community. And it would be if the drinks prices were a bit more competitive. A bit of fine tuning here and the Bar would be full every night and profits would be up. Having said that, neither of these points were a real issue for us.

The hotel was in a great location - very easy to find, just 5 minutes walk from Central Station. Our rooms were at the back of the hotel and while the view wasn't astounding (people's back yards) it was certainly very quiet and peaceful with no street noise at all.

Once we got into our rooms we were happy to see that they were spacious, clean and well furnished, with one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in - it was like sleeping inside a cloud! As far as the location goes, I already mentioned that the hotel is just a few minutes walk from Central Station. If you take a few minutes to look at a decent street map and work out exactly where you are, there are plenty of short-cuts nearby which get you to one of the main shopping areas and Dam Square in a matter of minutes. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants on the same street as the hotel, as well as a really great bakery (\"La Boulangerie\") directly across the street. If you should plan on visiting any of the infamous coffee shops while you're in Amsterdam, follow the alley at the side of the bakery and you will see Abraxas on the very next left-hand corner - it's a little out of the way for most tourists so seems to only be used by locals, a really friendly place and their cakes are particularly delicious :-) A top tip for anyone who might be planning to visit Artis Zoo: admission is 18.50, but check out Lovers Cruises (you'll pass their ticket office on the way to the hotel when you leave Central Station) - for 21.50, you can travel to the zoo on a canal boat which takes about 15 minutes, then they will also pick you up and you get a 45 minute canal ride on the way back. So you get an hour boat ride for just 3 Euros! All in all, the hotel and location were superb and everything we hoped it would be.

We were put on the first floor overlooking the street outside. The noice from the street did not disturb us too much. We booked it trough internet and got a much better price than advertised in the reception. The room was clean and had a very nice bed for our son, not the extra \"kids do not care\" type of bed. One of the other beds was slightly leaning so you felt as tipping out of the bed. There was something special about the floor in this room as it felt like uneven concrete under the wall to wall carpet thus makeing the bed lean. The room had nice area to sit and plan your day. Fridge could be used for your own stuff after unpacking the well stocked minibar. They had a kettle with coffee and teabags to use during the day. Bathroom had a tub and plenty of hot water. The sink showed a lot of wear and should be changed as soon as possible as it looked dirty. Along the silicon line there was mould and a wall tile was cracked. Lots of shampoo and all the little funny bottles of conditioner and shower soap. Staff was very nice and polite. They offer free apples at reception. The location is very good for walking around to see the different sights. It is an easy walk to the hotel from the central train station where you end up when taking the train to the city from the airport. For kids its god to know that the down side of the red light district is not visible around the hotel. You will find caf\u00c3\u00a9s selling drugs but this is Amsterdam. If you take left when leaving the hotel and go straight down the street you will find a large store where you can buy food, drinks and snacks. It is the one almost opposit the church. In front of the store some large stairs and a big blue sign with the name of the chain. When taking left as you exit and walk towards the station you will pass the bike rental firm Yellow in just a minute or two. Do hire bikes and see the canals, we did and had some fantastic two hours going around in the bike friendly city. Amsterdam is an expensive hotel town that I know, but I would have been very disappointed of the room and its faults - leaning bed - the sink that should be changed - the mould spots - cracked tile - the strange feeling of rough concrete under the carpet if paying the full rate.

In addition the hotel is located opposite the tram stop so easy access to the museums too. Generally the hotel is in a pleasant enough location to avoid the seedier side of Amsterdam and close enough to major attractions. Our room was spacious, clean and had three big windows looking out onto the main street but was suitably sound proofed. A comfortable night's sleep was ensured by the very comfortable bed. The styling of the room, however, is somewhat dated with mahogany furniture and brass lamps and the bathrooms look rather tired. Generally the rooms do not exude the French flair and luxury that is such an important component of the Sofitel brand. There is no turndown service in the evening and only one bathrobe and slippers for two people.

It's in a safe/clean neighborhood, tram line is right in front of the hotel, and less than 5 mins walk to the DAM. There is a large supermarket in close proximity also. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, 22 euros per person sounds like a lot for breakfast food. Hotels has a basket of apples, tangerines at the counter which is a nice little treat on your way in/out of the hotel. If you don't have your lab top, you can get an internet card and use their business center. 10 euros for 45 mins and about 13 euros for 90 mins; we got the 90 mins and we were able to use this same internet access card at the Marriott in Brussels (i-Bahn). We got our rooms on the 1st floor adjacent to an alley; you can hear people talk when they walk by! I suggest asking for a room on a higher floor. Rooms are much smaller than expected but maybe considered large Amsterdam stardard. Extra information/tips not directly relevant to the hotel..... We were there during Dec. 25-28 (all the small businesses were closed).... didn't noticed until the very last day that there is an internet place a few doors over (north of the hotel, same side). We had a dinner meal at this Holland restaurant just a few doors south of the hotel, same side.... we didn't like it. Service was good but I suggest look elsewhere for food near the hotel.

We booked this hotel via an agency as i was travelling with a friend who was on a budget and i didnt want to bother looking around and i was initially sceptical about he choice (could i have chosen i would propably opt for something like Dylan or Arena hotel). I dont know the exact rate but i think it should be around 120-140 euros for a twin with breakfast. For this price level (we were there in xmass which is apparently a,low season to them) this was a very good choice. Convenient location, near but not on the sleezy red lights and very near the 3 beautiful canals (dont remember the names). We got a 5th floor room and it was biggy and confortable with pleasant street views, nice bed, clean and mora than aynything quiet (no noice from neighboring rooms). We were treated in a prof way albeit impersonal (which was still ok). Few negatives which didnt spoil my good feeling: Boring breakfast in an unatractive room (why couldnt they have a more interesting and richer range of cheeses?), dated and more like a 3* bathroom (but not small). Overall if you can get a good rate and a top floor room and if you dont mind this kind of impersonal feeling this is a good pick.

Here is my synopsis: Pros: The bed. I would venture to say it was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in while traveling - and I travel at least one to three months per year. Best nights of sleep I have had in a very long time. I never heard one outside noise the entire week. Even if there were no more positives, the bed was worth the entire stay. The location. It amuses me that someone would book a hotel within a 5-minute walk of the Red Light district, in a city where smoking marijuana in public is accepted, and then fault the hotel for reminding them of the seedier side of Amsterdam. We walked the city every day for a week and never even happened upon the Red Light District - literally forgot to visit it! And the smoking coffee shops are everywhere in the city - not just on the same street as the hotel. That being said, I found the location perfect for the first-time traveler to Amsterdam simply because it's in very close proximity to many of the places a new tourist visits. It's about 3 blocks from Central Station (walk or pay 15E for a taxi!), it's around the corner from Dam Square, and there is a tram stop directly in front of the hotel - it truly doesn't get anymore convenient than that! The staff. Although I wasn't sure at first, the staff (for the most part) turned out to be helpful and courteous. We were treated with respect and kindness no matter what we asked for or needed to know. As with most European hotel experiences I've had, they don't actively jump in and offer to help, but they are there when you need them. One thing I greatly appreciate about Amsterdam is that most people in the service industry speak perfect English. Cons: The lighting. I agree with the other reviewers that the lighting absolutely needs to be improved in both the bedroom/living areas AND the bathroom. My friend's room next door was even worse - and that was before two of her lightbulbs burned out. The fitness room. Although it is a treat to be offered a fitness room in a European hotel, this one isn't worth calling a treat. A recumbant bike whose seat would not stay in position, a rowing machine, and a thing to do crunches/sit-ups. No free weights and no paper cups for the water fountain. It needed an eliptical or treadmill or both! The Internet. T-mobile - need I say more? I spent a small fortune to have access for a week here, then went to Prague and got 24/7 wireless for free. Other than that, I found no fault with Sofitel Amsterdam, and although I probably would not stay there again (because I always like to try other parts of a city when I come back), I would definitely recommend it to any first-time visitors. I thought it was a good value, great location, and the pros definitely outweighed the cons. I'd like to add that if you are a chocolate lover, you absolutely MUST walk to Puccini at Singel 184. Simply the best, IMHO. It's no more than 10 minutes to walk from the Sofitel.", "Date": "September 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cAmazing stay\u201d", "Author": "annarex", "ReviewID": "UR8675108", "Content": "My new husband and I booked the sofitel for the begining of our honeymoon in Europe.

Even though it has a prime location and is easy walking distance to many key attractions (including the red light district if you are interested in that sort of thing). The hotel itself leaves something to be desired. First of all, the parking situation: If you are driving, do not stay in this area AT ALL! It is very tricky to get around and they are doing a lot of road construction in the area. Once you do get to the parking area it is a ways down the street and it was not very enjoyable dragging our suit cases from the car. What I was most upset about was cost of the parking. We are not strangers to parking in European city centers, however, when we found the cost of parking was 40 euros we were a bit upset, especially since the website does not bother to mention the cost. Next, the rooms: The rooms were quite nice except for the noise and the lighting. We had every available light turned on and the room was still very dark, and that was during the day. We could also hear a lot of noise from our neighbors and from above us. We skipped breakfast for 2 reasons. First, we were tired of eating big breakfasts (this was our last night of a month long trip in Europe). Secondly, the price 22 Euros/person. A steep ransom for eggs, cheese and cold cuts. Another turnoff for us was the surroundings. As soon as you step outside the hotel you are in the thick of what makes Amsterdam not-so-charming, the sex and drugs! We are not prudes, but we both feel that Amsterdam could be one of the Europe's most charming, attractive cities if they got rid of the red light area and the drugs.

My first rating was 4 out of 5, but this time it is only 3 out of 5. I would give 2 out of 5 if my stay had not been so cheap. You can often have a good special offer on the Sofitel website, and I never paid more than 128 euros a night in this hotel (the regular price is 255 euros per night). For comparison, the Ibis hotel (a 2-star hotel owned by the same hotel chain, Accor) near the Sofitel is about 115 euros a night, and offers no promotional rates. At check-in, I was given a voucher for a free drink at the bar because I was a returning customer. The receptionist had a friendly attitude rather than a formal one, but he was very nice. When I entered my room, I saw a smoke detector though I had requested a smoking room. I called the concierge who told me that it was for... marijuana detection, not cigarette. What a shame for a 4-star hotel to lie to their guests as if they were kids! Of course, it was just a desactivated cigarette-smoke detection device. Anyway, I didn't intend to smoke marijuana. But one night, I could cleary smell cannabis in the corridor at my floor, I guess that's the downside of the promotional rates (another one may be this guy I saw yawning extremely loudly at the beautiful hotel bar). That's very disappointing, but there is more. One night, I was out and came back at the hotel at 3 o'clock. There is a nightbell, so I rang it, but no one opened the door. I waited and rang again and again. Then a pizza delivery person came (it seems that you can order a pizza at 3 am in Amsterdam) and told me that there is usually always someone to open the door and that it was the first time that something like that happened to him at this hotel. I tried to look through the window next to the door because it was the location of the reception, and I was (barely) able to see someone sleeping in an armchair through the curtain, in a small office. I couldn't reach the window to knock at it, though. The pizza deliverer had a cellphone and tried several times to call the hotel, but no one answered. At some point, he decided to go to the police station, across the street. While he was there, the door finally opened. I came in, and went to the reception. I explained to the receptionist that I was stuck outside for about half an hour, that a pizza deliverer was at the police station because he was worried something unusual happened, etc. The receptionist's answer was a single word: \"ok\". He did not tell me that he fell asleep or anything, he acted as if everything was normal. \"I got stuck outside for half an hour\" - \"ok\". Can you imagine that? I can understand that he fell asleep because that's the kind of things that can happen to you at least once in your life. But I can't understand that he did not apologize, or that he was the only person in the hotel at the reception. Another disappointment was on my second stay in this hotel. One morning, I was sleeping when the maid came to clean the room, so I told her to come back later. The concierge later phoned me to ask me if I wanted the room to be cleaned today or not. I asked if it was possible to have it cleaned at 2 o'clock and the concierge told me that it was ok. I left my room and came back at 3pm (I was ill this day and needed to stay most of the day in my room), and the room had not been cleaned. The maid finally came at 5pm, while I was in the room, which was not very conveniant. All those problems make me think that you can't rely too much on the staff. The room service menu at night is rather limited. Pizzas which are not very tasty, a really good club sandwich, and maybe one or two other options which I have not tested. One night, I had a tiramisu for desert, but unfortunately it was not completely unfrozen. The next night, I ordered the tiramisu again and it was good. On the phone, I was asked \"and a bottle of water like yesterday ?\", which is a nice attention. The room itself is nice, clean, maybe a bit small if you pay the full price. It was on the 5th floor and was almost identical to the rooms on the 1st floor. You can read my previous review for more information about the room. There was only one bathrobe though it was a double room and we were two. Oh, and I have to say that the beds are incredibly comfortable. So I felt disappointed this time, but I must say that I would return if I can get the same promotional rate. The first time I paid 99 euros/night, the second time I paid 119 euros, and the third time 128 euros. At such rates, this hotel has a really good value. But you will certainly not find the feeling of luxury here, in any way.

During my various stays, I was booked in a couple of different rooms, which gave me a good overview of the hotel. First, the rooms in the 500's are on the front of the building and they are very spacious. I believe I stayed in 502 and it had a lot of room and a big bathroom. Some of the rooms on the back of the building tend to be smaller. I always asked and they would move me once they had room. I would recommend asking for a room with space if you feel cramped. They were really nice about moving rooms. The double and kind beds are really comfortable! I think that when you are away from home, there is nothing more important than a comfortable bed. After staying in other Amsterdam hotels that are in the center of the city, none of those beds even compare to the Sofitel. Location: You cannot beat this location! First, the train station is only a 5-7 minute walk away. I took the train from the airport to the hotel multiple times. It was quicker than a cab ride and the walk was really easy. Second, it is close to Dam Square and backs up to a ton of great shopping. Third, it is close to the Singel canal that was a lot of great places to eat. Complaints -- I think that the room service menu could be updated. I do, however, recommend the pizza and the burger selection. Their wine selection for room service is also pretty good. My second complaint is the fitness center. There is hardly anything down there (only a rowing machine and a bike). That being said, most of the hotels in Amsterdam are lacking on the fitness center.

Our one disappointment was that it was on the side of the hotel with a poor view but other than that it was a lovely room. THE BED is the most luxurious bed I have ever slept in. It truly is like sinking into a fluffy marshmallow & so hard to get out of! We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as at 22euros we thought it a bit steep. We just popped over the road to a little cafe & ate there for less than 5 euros! Another great thing was that we didn't need to vacate the room until 12noon. As others have said the tea/coffee facilities were a bit mean with only 1 tea bag & no fresh milk, just a coffee whitener which tastes just awful in tea. I'm sure you could have asked for more but to be honest we just couldn't be bothered. We would reccomend getting an \"I Am Amsterdam\" card either from the Tourist Information or pre-pay on Expedia. Depending on how long you are staying you can choose either a 24, 48 or 72 hour pass. We had a 48 hour pass which cost appox \u00c2\u00a328 each. For that you get free entrance into loads of museums & attractions (inc. Rikjsmuseum and Van Gogh), a free trip guided canal boat tour, lots of discounts to many other places and restaurants and free public transport on trams, buses & metro. We certainly got our moneys worth out of it as most museums are approx 10 Euros entrance. The only one which wasn't included was the Anne Frank museum which is an absolute must in our opinion - a very moving experience & worth the 40min queue.

I would highly recommned this hotel to anyone!", "Date": "August 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place - Highly Recommended\u201d", "Author": "CWilkie74", "ReviewID": "UR5515461", "Content": "Stayed at the Sofitel during a very hot summer weekend in July. The hotel being a welcome (and cool!) retreat after a long days sightseeing. Location - couldn't be better. A ten minute walk from the main station and most of the major sights. Amsterdam is a great city to explore on foot so even the sights a little further away (like the Rijks Museum or Anne Franks house) are but a pleasent stroll away. If you don't fancy walking use the Canal Bus - it offers a hop on - hop off service to all the major sights and leaves from the main staion area just up the road. The hotel is on one of Amsterdam's main shopping streets so if you do need to buy anything you'll be spoilt for choice. There are plenty of bars and restaurants a stones through away but it may be better to pick somewhere a little further away from the main tourist areas. The hotel itself was lovely, the staff friendly and attentive. Check in / out went smoothly and every one concerned worked really hard to make my stay as pleasurable as possible. The room (number 408) was pleasantly decorated and well appointed, and had all the facilites one could possibly need. TV with channels in numerous languages, 'expensive' mini bar, bath robes, tea/coffee making facilites to name but a few. The beds were extremely comfortable, the air con worked well,!!! and the maid service was also of a very high standard. Previous reviews mentioned noise but I can't say I agree, bar the ocassional tram passing (which I felt was quite a pleasent sound) the hotel was really quiet considering its location. You get a complimentary bottle of water on arrival - but this is not replaced! All in all - a great hotel.", "Date": "July 27, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Convent Hotel Amsterdam", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d230120-Reviews-Convent_Hotel_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$183 - $301*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal 67</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1012 RE</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "230120", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2c/53/83/the-convent-amsterdam.jpg"}}
