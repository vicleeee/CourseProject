We booked a standard room which was small but manageable for two people. Small desk, small stocked refrigerator, luggage rack and armoire with ample hangers and shelves. Bathroom was small but very nice and clean with marble tiles, hair dryer and sufficient space for toiletries. The shower stall was excellent. Sliding doors which actually kept the water in the shower. Plenty of hot water and pressure. Room had AC which worked very well once we figured out controls. We only needed AC for 2 nights. Room was on the 3rd floor facing the street. Relatively quiet area at night. We were able to keep window open at night and heard little street noise (except in the morning when garbage truck briefly comes by ). Free wi-fi which worked every day. Hotel has a small but modern elevator. It will fit two adults and two pieces of luggage or 4 adults that want to get close and personal for a few seconds. The hotel was relatively quiet at nights but you can hear faint voices coming from other rooms. Not a real issue. We had 3 electrical outlets so we could charge all our electronics at night. We booked via email and paid much less than the stated price on their website. As our trip progressed, we stopped in a few other 3 star hotels to check prices and never found comparable hotel for less. The immediate vicinity around the hotel seemed safe, quiet and clean but not really all that \u201cquaint\u201d. It\u2019s not a caf\u00e9-rich area that one would want to stroll around. Really need to hop on the subway to get to those parts of Paris. Notre Dame is 4 metro stops away. Hotel is not really within walking distance of major sites (can walk to St. Sulpice and Luxembourg gardens) but it is a block away from two metro stations/lines, Sevres Babylone and Placide. This was very handy and we could reduce subway connections by selecting the best line for our given destination. We did not purchase the breakfast so can not comment. There is a small boulangrie two doors down where we could get assorted croissants before we started our day. Just down the street is the Bon Marche supermarket. It\u2019s a high-end supermarket which has all sorts of interesting foods. You can also get croissants and other bakery items there as well. There is a caf\u00e9 on the corner (Nemrod) where we had breakfast once. Also two caf\u00e9s near the Placide subway stop where we also had breakfast (reasonably priced delicious ham & cheese omelets but beware of the $8 pressed orange juice). Would definitely recommend this hotel to others and we would stay here again when we return to Paris.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haifa, Israel", "Title": "\u201cWonderfull stay, great location.

We arrived early via Eurostar and as our room was not ready, the friendly hotel clerk stored our luggage so that we could begin enjoying our stay. The staff could communicate in English which was a relief as I do not know but basic greetings in French. They gave us a map and directions. We returned later that night and our luggage had already been brought up - how nice! On first inspection, our room looked clean and nice - updated tile bathroom w/shower and no mold! A wardrobe in the corner held a small safe and room to store luggage or clothes. We shared a double bed - no evidence of bed bugs seen :) - and we had a room facing the street which had long windows which opened up to get fresh air. We also had a flat screen t.v. mounted in the corner above a small fridge and Air conditioner. The fridge was stocked with drinks at a cost - we did not use this. The air conditioning worked great as did the t.v. The room was somewhat small but we expected this. Upon further investigation, I noted that the wallpaper had many water stains (water damage?) and fuzzies or hopefully just dust bunnies on the walls. The bed was really comfortable but the bed pad under the bottom sheet had hair all over it. I managed to get most of it off - yes, I am picky about cleanliness - shouldn't we all be what with the bed bug infestation going around! So it would've rated excellent except for the walls and bed pad. I believe this hotel has better rooms due to the reviews I read earlier. The location is great - close to two metros , Bon March Dept. store, a couple of restaurants, a good bakery next door, Le Jardin de Luxembourg is a short walk away, a food store -Le Epicurie I think it's called, by the Bon Marche, within walking distance to Rue Saint Germain where you will find lots of shops and restaurants - one of our favs was Cafe Deux Magot - touristy - yes, but great coffee and croissants!
