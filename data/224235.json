{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Things have changed for the better I had stayed at this property before and only decided to come back for the cheap rates. Was in town for the state fair. Last visit was previous year. When I checked in, the young lady was extremely friendly and very helpful(forgot her name). When I told her my last visit was less than satisfactory, she sincerely apologized. She then explained there was complete new management and that they had just done some remodeling to the hotel.As I saw my room, I could tell that the front desk clerk did not lie to me. The room had a nice size tv, very nice smelling, nice granite counter tops in the kitchen. I was extemely impressed with the room.Already feeling better about my stay, what really surprised me was getting a call from the GM herself the next day. She also apologized about my last visit and asked what she could do. I thanked her and mentioned that she had already done plenty by the great service her staff had given me. Cant wait for next year...already booked my reservation for next year!!Thanks for everything", "Date": "Dec 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR509155603", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ChillyWilly101"}, {"Content": "Too Dangerous Crime Infested area, Police Sirens all night long, Gun Shots all night long, Prostitutes in the parking lot. no security, Police response slow. they found a dead person while I was there that overdosed on cocaine. managment had bad additude problems, They were not nice people. vending machines rarely worked. the neighborhood where the resturants were was too dangerous to walk through.

I was promised a room for the handicapped in a day or two of arrival. It was 5 weeks before I got it. There were two chairs in the room and both were broken. I had to sit on the bed. I was moved, due to remodeling and the room I got had a broken toilet and a sink that never stopped that constant drip that keeps one awake through the night. It is the cheapest place to live that I can find without a lease, so here I stay. They have one security person that walks the parking lot through the night and that makes me feel a bit better. That is a plus. Other than that, I am not happy with this place.", "Date": "Oct 30, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR570896401", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Terrible service Terrible customer service. I booked a room for my girlfriend for a weekend(who drove down 5 hours from oklahoma) and I only stayed with her for 3 or 4 hours in the room for the 2 days we booked it, and the hotel manager complained and started making a hassle and forced me to pay for 2 people.I told him that we would go out and party and come back about 2am and I would stay with her for a few hours and then leave. he still forced me to pay for 2 people. I will never stay there again.
