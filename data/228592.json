The review by 'Travelgirl' was very helpful regarding the T10 ticket. We bought the ticket at the airport, however the tourist information told us to go to the train station to buy the ticket. This was a bit of a walk but we were in no hurry. The L77 bus was perfect. It took approx. 40 minutes and it terminates right outside the hotel. We were told by hotel staff that the quickest way to the centre of the city was to take the tram T3 which is a 5 minute walk away on the other side of the hospital across the road from the supermarket. Take this to the stop Palau Reial then transfer to the Metro (same name). This takes you to the Pl Catalunya. The best part of this is that if you are using the T10 ticket this counts as only one journey. (Remember to validate the ticket on both the Metro and the tram) The total journey time is approx 50 minutes but for less than 1 euro per person it is very good value. The hotel was clean and the apartments very large. We had a lounge area and a bedroom. There was a kitchen area which we did not use (we were only there 3 nights) but the bathroom was very clean and modern and plenty of hot water. We asked from a room as high up as possible and we were given one on the 8th floor. This has great views over the city and up to the hills. There was also a free safe in the room...excellent. The area around the hotel was very residential. Lots of small cafe/bars. We found a very good one...turn left out of the hotel, left again. Proceed down the road with the TV studio on your right. At the end of the road you will see an office block called Smith & Nephew turn left. The cafe/bar is called Cruixent. We were concerned about all the reviews regarding pick pockets etc, In the 3 days we were there we did not see anything nor did we feel intimidated at any time, including the city centre, the Metro and the Tram even though we used these well after midnight. Our 1st time in Barcelona will not be our last. We were quite happy to travel into the city and would certainly use the hotel again it was great value for money. The L77 bus leaves outside the hotel back to the airport but it goes to T1 first and waits there for 10 minutes before going on to T2. This takes around 1 hour.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kitchener, Canada", "Title": "\u201cQuiet hotel long way from City Centre\u201d", "Author": "TravelGirl181747", "ReviewID": "UR126464660", "Content": "The rooms are very spacious and all of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful \u2013 particularly those in housekeeping. The hotel really is a long way from downtown Barcelona but if we did it again I think I would stay there again anyway. The info provided here by other travelers was invaluable but I hope to add to it to make it even more helpful! There are pros and cons to this location. Pros: the neighborhood is quiet and feels very safe. There is a terrific grocery store within walking distance and there are buses outside the door of the hotel as well as 2 tram lines an easy walk away. The rates at this hotel are amazing. We booked two rooms for 4 people. One was a suite with a separate bedroom and the other was a standard hotel room. I am quite sure we paid less for these 2 rooms than 1 would have cost in the city centre. Cons: When you stay this far outside the city, you tend to make only one trip into town each day. That means that everything you need will have to be carried with you and anything you buy will travel with you all day. If your hotel is in the city centre you will have access to at least one clean bathroom \u2013 if you stay in San Joan Despi, you don\u2019t have this option! Transit The L77 leaves from both terminal 1 and terminal 2. Just ask at the airport information desk and they will direct you to the bus stop. The L77 is part of zone 1 of the bus system. If you are going to use public transit while in the city consider getting a multiple use pass. If you are traveling alone, there are lots of options for the pass but if you are traveling with others, you need to get the T-10 or the T-Familiar 70/30 in order to use the pass for more than one person. You can buy the pass at the bus stop at the airport. Each individual ride is 2 euro but with the pass is less than 1 euro per trip. If you are going to the beach, you can board the 157 bus right in front of the hotel. The trip takes an hour and 15 minutes but it is a fabulous way to see the city and you don\u2019t have to transfer. I actually preferred the bus to the tram/subway combination even though the bus took longer. The tram to the funicular only runs on holidays and weekends. Tips: Many things are not open in Barcelona on Sunday (as is the case in many European cities). If flying from North America, an evening flight on Saturday or Sunday during the day would be a good bet \u2013 that way you will sleep away the day that has the least amount going on.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAverage Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Sunny P", "ReviewID": "UR126261388", "Content": "Booked a lastminute.com deal.

When we got off the plane at Barcelona airport, i was a bit scared about getting public transport to the hotel, but we decided to try it and it was fantastic, and so cheap (T10 ticket for 10 journeys on all the public transport is only 8 euro). It is quite far to get from airport to city centre, then on to hotel - you have to get the train from the airport, switch onto metro then onto tram or bus, but the public transport system is really easy to follow (way easier than London!) and ticket machines are in English. On our first go from the airport it took us about an hour to get to the hotel, but for journeys from the hotel into and out of the city you can do it on the tram and metro in half an hour. Tram and bus stops really close to the hotel. There's a Mercadona (supermarket) right opposite one of the tram stops near the hotel and also a little convenience store and a bakery around the corner from the hotel entrance, so it's easy to pick up some food for a cheap easy dinner back in your hotel room (the kitchenette with fridge was a godsend) and for packed lunches to have whilst you're visiting one of Barcelona's fantastic sights! We saved so much money eating this way rather than eating in restaurants. Room was basic but clean, shower was lovely. Only downside was the walls were a bit thin, so if you get noisy neighbours (as we did on 2 of the nights), you won't sleep too well. Also, we found out that if you want to have pots & cutlery etc for the kitchenette you have to ask at reception when you arrive, otherwise these won't be provided. We didn't use the pool, spa or gym but apparantly these were available for guests. Overall, it was a great base for our trip to Barcelona. If you're happy to use public transport to get around then it's great and very cheap to stay here.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cCheap and nice\u201d", "Author": "vikabresp", "ReviewID": "UR114772350", "Content": "It's a very nice hotel, three stars, and you receive what you payed.

The pool was a very pleasant surprise as was the sunshine ! The staff were great they helped us with location , maps , and amentities. Our room had a balcony over looking the pool and the kitchenette was a god send . The local Mercadona (supermarket) was 10 min walk (stroll) max and really reasonable with everything u could need and all fresh. To the back of our hotel was a small precinct which included a chemist , bar and 2 restuarants of which the traditional one was stunning. The tram stop for T3 was just the other side of the hospital which was next door to the hotel. This then took you to Paul Riel from where you could join the green line metro and from there you could go anywhere. The T10 ticket is the best value at just 7.95 euro for 10 journeys on either tram or metro.But the best bit is that once your ticket is stamped (in the machines on board) you can get on and off as many trams or metros as you like for 1 hr 15mins and not use up any more of your journeys !!. Getting off at the Liceau stop on the Green Line brings you up right in the middle of the La Ramblas and very near to the Bouquiera Market.The journey from hotel to Liceau via Tram and then Metro took 40 mins max and the last Metro/Tram back was approx 2am which means you can enjoy the city for longer. The city has sooo much to offer the big red tour bus is a fab idea to get your bearings but a good wander is also a top idea. Airport to Hotel is easy also, the L77 bus from outside the airport takes you door to door and for just 1.45 euro ......bargain ! You can also travel by tram and metro I believe but the bus seemed the best option as no changes , espeically with suitcases this was easier. The area where the Hotel is, San Joan Despi is lovely as well with a huge park at the bottom of the hotel road and the precinct I mentioned before.

The metro is just across the road (you could ask someone which direction). at the metro, jump onto the L1 (red line) heading towards Hospital De Bellvitge, then change at Espanya (L3 Green Line) heading towards Zona Universitaria, then get off the metro at Maria Cristina. You can then catch a 78 across the road. as soon as you get out of the metro system, turn left and cross the road there. Just look at the bus stops, they have numbers on them refering to which buses stop there. The bus stop you want is across the road, facing the huge shopping centre (on the other side of the road). the 78 will take you directly to the hotel, it stops right outside the front reception doors. Just ask the bus driver as we did and sit at the front of the bus if its your first time if your a little worried. the bus takes about 40mins. my husband and got back to the hotel late at night most of the time. the metro closes from midnight and most bus services cease from 10.30pm. You can catch the N15 (bus stop right outside the hotel) staright to Las Ramblas (and then catch N15 again to head back to the hotel). you can also catch the 78 or 157 buses (bus stop right outside the hotel) to get to town and vice versa. this will take about 50mins. we absolutely loved this hotel. the staff were friendly and polite. i would definetly stay at this hotel again, and seriosuly didnt mind the hour long journey into the heart of Barcelona. I guess that might have been because we stayed for 4 days only, but this was one of the best holidays I've been on! also, luckily, our room didnt face the hospital building site. it faced the fanstatic view of barcelona (well, we thought it was Barcy! lol). nonetheless. view was really lovely. we could also see the pool from our balcony. the pool wasnt great tbh. it wasnt heated and doesnt get much sun as it is surrounded by tall buildings. this didn't stop other people using it. we would have used the pool if it was heated, regardless of the tall buildings, but why bother with a communal ppol when you can go to Barceloneta (Barcelona's beach), which stretches for ages and is really clean (although lots of nudity! which isnt the nicest thing to see on some people). we didnt really like las ramblas, we got a dirty street vibe from it, although we did eat there few times (paellas). the resturaunts we went to were closer to Liceu metro stop on the Red line. we also had a caricature done 20euros for 2 people in one picture. it will be hanging on our wall very soon! depending on what your into, we checked out Parc Guell and were bored. we were recommeded to go there so we did, but only spent 30mins there, although it took 40mins to get there and back. waste of time, but glad we went only because we might have regretted it later. it's a pretty park with some beautiful views of the whole city and port, with some strange architecture, but it all just gets a little repetitive really. you can get there by getting off at Universitat (red line) metro stop, and jumping onto the 24 bus. there is an amazing bakery behind the hotel. they bake croissants and bread etc... PLEASE PLEASE try there croissants and bread as they are the best we've ever had in our lives! my mouth is watering now just thinking about it! also, try out the hotel's gym (free of charge) and jacuzzi and sauna.. it cost about 6euros each for 30mins each to use jacuzzi and sauna. we had fun, the pressure was great for my bad back. everything was clean too, and you'll find cleans towels ready for use there for you. you just have to book the day ahead. if you book it when you arrive, that might be best to use it the next day. also, when in las ramblas, be careful when ordering seafood paellas because i dont think they use very fresh fish/oysters/lobsters at some places, as i had a dodgey stomach a few times!

The first thing I noticed was how spotless the hotel was, as were the rooms. The reception staff, although not the friendliest people in the world, were very helpful. One day I asked them if they knew where a certain street was and the woman looked it up for me on the computer and found it on a map and everything :) Was the most obscure street in Barcelona, too! The annoying this was that we didn't have a balcony (about half the hotels don't) and the view out the window was a building site. But we already knew that. And to be honest all we wanted was a base to sleep in as we visited the centre of Barcelona nearly every day so weren't too bothered. The pool was small but nice, wasn't very busy either so had no problem getting sunbeds. Had a peek at the gym and that looked good and very clean. There is a decent shop nearby which is reasonable and a nice bakery but that's about it. There are a few shabby looking restaurants which may well be nice but it's not a touristy area AT ALL so you will struggle if you don't speak spanish (as we don't .) We tried one of them on the 2nd night, the guy didn't speak any english but was friendly. The menus were all in spanish so me and my friend just ordered the only thing we understood - I had chicken and chips and he had pizza lol. After than we ventured out. We would highly recommend 'Tapa tapa' which is near Casa batllo and Casa Milla. Tapas is great, instead of ordering one meal you order a few little ones :) Also there's a restaurant called 'Freeway' on Av. Diagonal which costs 13 euros I think but that's all you can eat - salads, chinese food, freshly cooked meat (you order what ever you want) and desserts. Just a word of warning regarding public transport. It's not as easy as people make out! We had a horrendous time trying to find the hotel. It took us about 4 hours to get from the bus station in Barcelona to the hotel! We didn't have a clue which ticket to get and there was noone to help us. I would not advise if you were travelling alone and especially if the flight arrives late in Barcelona or Girona. I went with a friend and felt very vulnerable and unsafe. Got to the hotel at midnight :( Mabye it didn't help that the friend I went with didn't have a clue and left it all up to me! You do save money though. If you're gonna be using public transport a lot (bear in mind the hotel is far out so you probably will) I would advise getting a Barcelona card - includes all your transport and some discounts at attractions. We got a T10 card which gives you 10 journeys (thats 10 JOURNEYS so if you caught a bus then a metro it would count as 1 journey.) I think it was 7 euros but that was for 1 zone only and we went through loads of zones! Nobody checked the ticket but to be on the safe side get a Barcelona card as the T10 cards for 2 or more zones were expensive. If you're flying from Girona - Leave the airport, go to where the buses are and , as you look at it from the airport , the bus stop you need to get to Barcelona is on the right hand side (one bus goes to Barcelona, the other goes to Girona centre!) Buy a 'Barcelona Bus' ticket from the rather unfriendly ticket woman (20 euros I think return) and make sure you get the right bus! Once you reach the main bus station (1 hour 20 mins away) get off the bus and you need to go up some stairs and cross the main road and you'll see a red 'M' sign for the metro (metro is underground, like the tube.) This is called 'Art de Triomf' metro station. Buy a T10 ticket or a Barcelona ticket or whatever you want (there is a button to press to get the screen in english) and get on the red line heading to Bellvitge ( might say Hospital de Bellvitge.) Get off at Catalunya. Then get on the Green metro line and get off at Maria Cristina. You need to exit the metro station onto the main street - then you have 2 options. Get a tram or a bus. I would highly recommend the bus - get a 157 or a 78. It will drop you off right outside the hotel . If you take the tram get off at San Marti de l'Erm but it's a 10 minute walk from the hotel (again - not a good idea if it's late at night.) To get from the hotel to anywhere decent :) then take a 157 bus outside the hotel which will take you straight to La Ramblas but takes about an hour - or take a 78 bus , get off at Maria Cristina and get the metro from there to wherever you wanna go. like I said the first day was awful but after that I quickly got the hang on public transport and found it to be excellent. I would recommend : Sagrada Familia (dont bother with the combined ticket as it includes Park Guell which is closed anyway! Only a small section open and its free to the public) La Ramblas Montjuic (you have to get a special metro called Funicular Montjuic I think to get there as it's so high up but it's included in T10 or Barcelona card or whatever.) There's a Castle, Olympic Football Stadium, Magic Fountains, Art galleries, etc... Get there early as by the time we went the Castle was still open but none of the rooms were. Plus the Magic Fountains are not on every day! I think it said Thurs, Fri and Sat in the evening - we made the mistake of sitting around waiting for it on the Wednesday before we read the sign properly!! Castle and Olympic stadium are free, as is the 'Caixa Forum' art gallery which is excellent - modern art. The cable car to get from where the metro stops to Montjuic itself is expensive so just get a bus instead - goes to exactly the same place. You can use your t10 / barcelona card too. Casa Milla - a beautiful example of Gaudi's work. Cost about 10 euros, though. Casa Battlo round the corner was 13 euros so we couldn't afford to do both!! Cathedral (free after 5 o clock!) Gothic Church in the Gothic Quarter - closes about 3 I think Singers / musicians in the Gothic Quarter outside the Cathedral I think that's a long enough article! If you want any more information about anything, send me a message I'd be happy to help you.

When we arrived the living room table was sticky with spilled soda and there was a significant amount of dust by the windows, but apart from that, cleaning was fine throughout. The hotel offers free wifi, but the lack of speed rendered it useless. The breakfast is fine, with toast, rolls and pastry and a variety of fruit. Severel kinds of juice. Hot cocoa if you ask the staff. The hotel is located in an area under development with some office and residential buildings nearby. Contrary to information stated by other reviewers, there is in fact a small grocery store just 50-100 meters away opened till 20:00. There is a restaurant in the hotel, but don't use it unless your only aim is to satisfy your hunger - the food is incredibly boring! There is a direct bus connection with the city center 50 meters from the hotel, if you take bus 157. It takes 40-45 minutes to reach downtown. It may appear a disadvantage that the hotel is located so far from city center, but we actually ended up enjoying the bus ride back to our quiet little retreat after roaming the noisy streets of the inner city.

Although the journey was on average 40 mins, it felt like half that. We ended up getting a couple of T10 tickets which worked out good value - just remember to swipe them within an hour and a 1/4 of your last swipe, otherwise it will print a time a date on the back of the ticket which will signify another of your 10 journeys has been used. We flew with Ryanair to Girona, got a return \"Barcelona Bus\" ticket for 21 \u20ac which dropped us off at the main bus depot in Barcelona (Estaci\u00f3 del Nord). From there we crossed the road to the Arc de Trionf and made our way on to the L1 (red) metro heading towards Hospital De Bellvitge. We then changed at Espanya and boarded the L3 (green) metro heading towards Zona Universitaria. We then got off the metro at Maria Cristina and boarded a T3 Tram (over the road) heading towards Sant Feliu / Consell Comarcal and got off at the Sant Marti de l' Erm. When you get off the Tram, the hotel is on the other side of the busy road. Thankfully for us we arrived at night so saw the Blue Neon Hotel name on top of the hotel. Because we arrived late, the little Grocery store literally around the back of the hotel (which sold pretty much everything you'd ever need (apart from cigarettes!)) was closed so we went to the Petrol Service station which was in the opposite direction back on the main street a little further up. There we stocked up on a few essentials (bread, milk, etc). The hotel room iteslf was spacious, clean and well laided out. Good beds with extra blankets in wardrobe. We had to ask for the Kitchen stuff to be brought up and it was delivered in a box the following morning. In there you get a very basic selection comprising frying pan, two sausepans, two sets of knives / forks / spoons, two plates, two dishes, can opener, ladle. Strangley however no Kettle. We asked for one though and it was delivered to our room within five minutes. TV has 30 channels - all spanish except Eurosport and Sky News both in English (Bonus!). Also worth mentioning is the Barcelona Card (google it) which once bought pays for pretty much all your transport, and entitles you free or discounted entrance on certain Attractions & Restaurants. Whatever you do though keep your travel passes as straight as possible. We bent one of ours and renderred it useless. Overall, we were super impressed with both Bacelona and the Hotel.

The room was perfect and very spacious. Use the T3 tramline and change at Maria Cristina to use the metro. The T10 ticket card was perfected as it suited our needs. Just remember to keep validating the card each time you board a train, tram, or bus. You get an hr and quarter with an option to change your transport type upto 3 times to reach your destination. If this is within your hr and quarter limit, the machine will recognise this and will not take a ticket allowance from your 10 tickets. It is around 10 mins on tram to Camp Nou. We visited this on our first day, was magnificent. We followed this with a bearings trip to find our way around the city. There's a great beach at Barcelonetta which takes around 45 mins to reach from the hotel. If you do visit the hotel, make sure you visit the small shops round the corner from hotel. It is situated just behind the hotel and there is this small bakery that allows you to eat in. Here they do a small choice of tapas also that was brilliant. We never found this until our last day unfortunately. The food we had here beat any other food we had in spain. The only downside to the hotel facilities is that to order room service, in the brochure it states that you ring up room service and then they put you through directly to the pizza place. They give you a seperate number to call which you do get charged for. The food was great and you don't pay for this until you check out. I didn't like the way they say you get put through directly but then this is just nit-picking the only bad thing about the hotel than just the location. If you do arrive late and require food after midnight, then there is a 24 hr garage around a 5-10 minute walk by the tram stop.
