We had read the TripAdvisor reviews beforehand so expected the worst. It really wasn't that bad, but undoubtedly you get what you pay for. If you arrive expecting 3/4 star accommodation then you will be disappointed. If you want a basic, clean cheap to stay then you will be happy enough. The decor is pretty odd and very dated. It really feels like about 1975. The room I had was pretty small with only a view to an internal courtyard and a very hard basic bed. I slept ok but it wasn't ideal.

This is basically an acceptable enough hotel for short stays for business travel, as long as you don't mind the fact that the facilities are very dated, and the rooms are a bit cramped. The hotel looks like it was decorated in the mid-1970s and hasn't changed a bit. For example, there are ashtrays in the lifts (despite there being a no smoking sign in there too), brown stained-wood panelling everywhere and faded pictures of the company's other hotels plastered all over the lobby, and the many flags outside the lobby have seen better days. I actually got rather fond of its kitsch look after a few days there - it generally has the look of a government building in a banana republic of some kind. But I don't think that's what the owners were going for! Although the rooms have all the necessities, I wouldn't consider it a real four-star hotel. The breakfast is okay, and the place is certainly very clean and it seems safe, but you wouldn't want to spend so much time in the rooms as they are rather small and have no views (unless you like looking at felt roofing panels and stairwells). If you need somewhere conveniently located and cheap in Madrid for a night or so Positives: * Very cheap * Great location near the conference centre and two metro stops.

Please note: 1. The beds are horrible!!!! I travel lots for work and I have stayed in hotels between 3 and 5 stars. From the best to the not so great. This is the first time in my life that I encounter a place with such hard beds. The matresses do not have padding and you can actually feel the metals from inside the bed on your back. I have cramps all over my back. After two hours of laying in bed I cannot sleep anymore. All hotels I have been in have some sort of duvet or padding between the matress and the sheets so you do not fee like this. These matresses do not have that. The Front Desk Clerc gave 10 keys to visit 10 different rooms and ALL THE BEDS ARE THE SAME. 2. It is winter time and the heating sistem seems to be centralized or not really good. It is way too hot and I am actually not using any sheets over my body because I feel over heated. There is a thermostat but it does not seem to work. No matter the temperature I choose, the room feels exactly the same. I could turn it off but then I am afraid of feeling cold and wake up again not for the bed but this time because I am cold. 3. The breakfast is not so great either. They do not have those trays with the flames underneath to keep the food warm. So they prepare the eggs and if you get there one hour after the eggs have been prepared then you have to eat them cold. I have to say though that the selection is quite complete. 4. There is no gym!!! Again, 4 stars??? 5. There is no bell boy and there is no ramp between the entry level and the lobby. When I arrived I had to carry a heavy luggage down the stairs with no help. Not an easy task. 6. TV are 13 inches. Again, 4 stars with these tvs!!!!! 7. Just one telephone per room. 4 Star hotels should have a telephone next to bed, another one on the desk and another one (I think this is optional) in the bathroom. 8. No iron nor iron board!!!! However they have this stupid trouser's iron system. I am supposed to send my shirts for ironing to their laundry service which is just available before 10 am and they bring it back after 6 pm. What if you arrive at night and you need some stuff ironed for the following day of work???? 9. You have to put a coin in the safe, otherwise it does not release the key and you cannot lock it. I could go on and on and on with the things I have noticed in my two night stay here. I have been trying to get my company to move me to a Holiday Inn where I know the service will be very much standard and where I am pretty familiar with the beds, but the person who arranged my stay here pre-paid my stay, which happens to be of 7 nights, and they refuse to give us our money back.

From airport you need about 30 minutes by metro till Nuevos ministerios metro station (direct line) and then you have to walk about 15 minutes till you reach the hotel. From the hotel the nearest metro station is Alvarado (10 min. walking) and this is direct line to Sol station; you need about 20 min. by metro to Sol station. The location it\u2019s a little bit far from downtown! The personnel was friendly and helpful. The room was basic, large and clean with old furniture, but if you want to visit the city you won\u2019t spend too much time in the room.

The hotel itself is very clean and the rooms are serviced and cleaned daily. But the hotel is very dated with none of the facilities we have come to expect with a four star.There is no restaurant and the staff are extremely unfriendly and unapproachable and never believe in smiling. The Travel Department rep was very helpful and friendly though. The hotel is a distance away from the city centre for a short break but it is well serviced by local transport. Bus and metro stations close by and a taxi rank outside which costs approx 10 euro into town. There are shops and restaurants close by. But i would not recommend this hotel to anyone of any age.

My experience was horrible at this hotel. My wife and I arrived quite late in the evening (11:30pm or so), there was no porter to assist us with our luggage even though we obviously struggled with it ourselves (I didnt expect help anyway, not such a complaint). When we checked in the man behind the counter couldn't care less that we were there and didn't make eye contact with either of us during the entire duration of the check in. We asked if there was somewhere nearby that we could eat food and the guy behind the counter laughed at us and then produced a map and showed us while chuckling to himself a place that might still be open. We found this odd but dismissed it. The hotel room was not very nice (again I expected this so more informational than a complaint) and it didnt give me the feeling of safety in my hotel room, cant explain why. I had misplaced the map the staff member had given me but he had refused to provide me with another one when I had asked. I managed to spend some time in the room and eventually found it and then departed at about midnight to the restaurant recommendation that he had given us. The area is not so nice around the hotel at night and the deadbeat guy behind the counter must have thought he was playing a pretty funny joke on us by sending us to a very very seedy and unsafe area full of prostitutes and drug dealers. We didnt make it all the way to the restaurant because we felt unsafe and wanted to go back to the relative safety of the hotel but from a distance the \"restaurant\" looked to be a strip club... I travel constantly for my own business so am no stranger to hotels on the cheaper side but have never ever been experienced to such an event at any establishment. To purposely put a guest in harms way for ones amusement is in no way acceptable. Also, this is the first time that I have posted a review to trip advisor even though I use it often to scope out places to stay. In short, I am rarely the complainer but thought that I should share my experience with others. We checked out early the next morning.

I spent most of the day touring madrid, & used the mini bar facilities in the evening, rather than visit the many bars in the vicinity. (The prices were very reasonable & included champagne.) The hotel is not centrally located but is close to the san siro stadium which is very handy if your stay includes watching Real Madrid FC. The breakfast on offer was very good & plentiful. The foyer is very glam looking as you enter & i had little problem being understood as one of the receptionists spoke english. I found the room to be clean & spacious & just what i needed for my short stay. There are 3 metro stations nearby to choose from,: Nuevos Ministerios the nearest, takes you directly to the airport in 20 minutes.

I stayed at the Hotel Gran Atlanta in Madrid from the 30th September to the 11th October. Through Otel.com I secured a good online deal of 60 Euros per day which included breakfast. The hotel is situated in a quiet tree-lined street in a residential/small business area of what is known as the financial district of Madrid. There are a number of little parks in the vicinity of the hotel as well as caf\u00e9s and restaurants which primarily exist to service the locals. The small supermarkets near the hotel were very handy for purchasing bottled water, toiletries and snacks. There are two internet cafes situated up a side street directly opposite the entrance to the hotel. If you don\u2019t have your own computer I suggest you use these as the single terminal available at the hotel is rarely functioning and is also very expensive. The hotel is situated approximately 500 metres from Nuevo Ministeros Metro. The Metro operates a line from Barajas International Airport directly to Nuevo Ministeros. Take the free shuttle bus from Terminal 4 to Terminal 2 and the Metro from Terminal 2 directly to Nuevo Ministeros. The cost of the ticket is 1 Euro. There are a number of exits at Nuevo Ministeros. In order to shorten your journey to the Hotel exit at the Orense exit (Calle de Orense). Walk up the Calle de Orense as far as the Calle Bascillca, situated on the left hand side. Walk across Calle de Orense and Calle General Moscardo, and along Calle Basicillca into Calle del Commandate Zorita. The entrance of the Gran Atlanta Hotel is in this street. The room was clean and serviced on a daily basis. The single bed was adequate, and there was more than enough storage space. A feature that was appreciated was a pay safe costing 1 Euro. A bar fridge is stocked with various drinks and sweets. A list provided enables you to record the items you consume. The television has a number of channels, two of which are in English, namely CNN and BBC news. The bathroom consisted of a toilet, hand basin and a bath with overhead shower. The air-conditioning WHEN IT WORKED was effective. Unfortunately it only worked on 2 of the 11 days of my stay. Without the airco the heat in the room was very oppressive. The hotel was surprisingly quiet in spite of successive tour buses arriving with loads of tourists who stayed for a few nights at a time. Breakfast was perfectly adequate and consisted of the following self service buffet: fruit juices, fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, cold meats (ham and salami) and slices of cheese, croissants and pastries, toast, cereals, yogurts, cold tortillas, the \"doughnut\" dough bread popular with the Spanish and coffee. English is not widely spoken by the staff but they are most helpful and assisted me with all my requests including the selecting and booking of tours, arranging for the tours buses to collect me at the hotel and also with helpful suggestions on getting around the city. Although most of the residents of Madrid I encountered spoke little if any English, I experienced no difficulty in obtaining the services I required, whether a ticket at the Metro or ordering a meal at a Caf\u00e9, in spite of my not being able to speak any Spanish. I was very satisfied that I had chosen this hotel, in this part of the city rather than one of those downtown in the noisier, more heavily \u201ctouristed\u201d parts.", "Date": "October 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Faro", "Title": "\u201cA real disaster\u201d", "Author": "IVK", "ReviewID": "UR5884859", "Content": "It seems that the personnel of this hotel does not understand English - I used the wakeup service 3 times, and 2 times out of three they woke me up at a wrong time.
