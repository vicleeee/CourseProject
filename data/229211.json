The service was great and the location was within walking distance of main shopping areas and down town. If you did not want to walk far you could catch the tram from down the road. The room was fantastic, very clean and modern inside the room for an older style building in Amsterdam. The Room we had was the ONLY \"Family Room\" in the hotel (I was told) that slept 4 people with two good sized single beds pushed together to make a Queen sized bed on either side of the room (so 2x Queen sized beds) with a Flat screen TV up on the wall at the foot of the bed. We also had a desk area up near the beds and a good sized bathroom with separate bath and shower with the toilet separately located around the corner. Plus a separate sitting area for 4 people and another flat screen TV. near the Tea and Coffee making facilities. The Wardrobe was the buildings original big old walk in safe that had been converted into a walk in robe, with in room safe in there too. The only downside to this extra large family room was the fact that it was the only room downstairs from reception (in the basement area) but the room did have a large sky light window that had an automatic blind to close it off at night. But I would have gladly forgone any views from upper floors to have this type of space in a European hotel room. You can easily stay in this room for a week or more and not feel too squashed as the room was sectioned of into a sleeping area, hallway and sitting area, like a small apartment rather than a normal hotel room. Very good price booked through Octopus Travel online for around 100 euros per night. Breakfast was served in the hotel (included in the price) and was eggs, bacon, breads, pastries and cereals etc. which is always a bonus when included in the price. I can only comment on the size of our room as I did not see the regular rooms, but if travelling with lots of luggage there is a lift that you can take the one floor down, but it does lead through the \"Back of House\" but after we took our luggage to our room via the lift, we used the stairs every other time, that were just outside our room that lead straight to the reception desk. The room was great the beds were very comfortable and we would stay here again (in that downstairs family room) and would recommend this place to friends and family.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNice location but not 4*\u201d", "Author": "NiamhyN", "ReviewID": "UR126031368", "Content": "This hotel is based in a lovely area near the museum quarter.

It is a city hotel that is both small but modern for those who wish some comfort but do not intend to spend hours each day in the hotel, therefore there is no spa/pool/gym etc, but the rooms are adequate sized for a double or twin beds and have the necessary comforts and on suite shower/bath facilities. Breakfast is certainly worth considering as the selection is both Continental and English and it certainly sets you up for the day.

Also handy is the airport shuttle bus stops outside the concert hall on the same street (a 4 Euro fare ride from Schipol airport) Last time we stayed at the Wyndam Apollo which ok is 4* all over, but for a city break for sightseeing not business then we would stay at the Memphis again - no hesitation", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NORTH CAROLINA", "Title": "\u201cWould Stay Again\u201d", "Author": "LIKETOTRAVEL125", "ReviewID": "UR124148610", "Content": "I was somewhat nervous about staying here after reading some of the past reviews, but when I got here I was pleasantly surprised.

They gave me tips on transportation, places to go, food and overall things to do in Amsterdam. I called the hotel a couple of times because I got lost in Amsterdam to get directions and they were very helpful. One night, I came into the hotel, right as the restaurant was closing. I asked if they were still open, they informed me they were not. The chef/cook was coming from the back as I was talking to the host. He asked me what would you like. I said well you are closing, he than said no I will cook something for you. What would you like, I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don't know \" He asked if I liked chicken, I said yes.

Also the bathrooms don't have latches. So, if you are sharing rooms with business associates, you may want to reconsider. Excellent breakfast, with good variety to offer. Courteous staff at restaurant. bar and reception. Good house keeping services as well. All in all, would reccommend for single persons or couples or families.

I can't even remember how long. I've been through a couple of changes of management/ownership and am happy to say that the Memphis has weathered the storms well. I am on a first name basis with most of the staff and many of them have been with the hotel for as long as I have been coming as a guest. And, when I come, I stay for at least a week. So, I do know my way around this hotel. The Memphis is a four star hotel and has the corresponding amenities. So, I'm not going to go down the list of what you would expect to find here. You will. The breakfast is very good as well as the bar. Just this past year they have made the breakfast room into a full service restaurant open for lunch and dinner. I haven't had a chance to sample it for anything but breakfast, but friends say it is good. Anything you might want in a fine hotel is to be found here. I teach a yearly seminar in Amsterdam and we started using this hotel because of a reasonably-priced conference room in addition to reasonably-priced rooms. Now, there are two features that keep me coming back - staff and location. The hotel staff is as professional and friendly as you will ever find. They are multilingual and can handle anything you throw at them. I am multilingual myself and attest that they do a fine job. They have always gone out of their way to serve us in any way. On my most recent trip, my assistant rented a bicycle at the hotel to experience the unique feel of Amsterdam. Seeing her struggle to get comfortable with hi bike, the head chef ran out to help and ended up taking her and her friends on a brief tour of the neighborhood. Typical Memphis staff! The second feature this hotel has going for it is location, in the museum quarter right at the intersection of De Lairessestraat and Cornelius Schuyt Straat, a well-known, upscale shopping street with restaurants good for celebrity watching. You are an easy walk from the three big museums and the Concertgebouw. Tram 16 goes right by the hotel and Tram 2 is two blocks down Cornelius Schuyt Straat. I LOVE this neighborhood!!! You are well-removed from the craziness of tourists in the red light districts and some of the more seedy parts of town. You could stay at the nearby Hilton, of course.

The location is good with the 16 Tram route taking you into the centre of Amsterdam in 15mins and an easy walk to Museumplein. We found a great place for breakfast at Bagels and Beans just opposite the Albert Cuypstraat tram stop. We didn't eat nearby or at the hotel as they all seemed a bit expensive to us. We would recommend the city pass that you can buy at the Tourist information centre if you want to visit some of the excellent museums because this also includes a tram/bus pass. We are good walkers but used the tram a lot and if you pay by the hour it is 2.60 Euros a time.

I came across a \"hot deal\" on the internet and after trawling through so many hotels in amsterdam I thought that I would pay a little bit extra for this \"hot deal\", (hoping it might be a room upgrade or something but as it happens it was just a cheaper internet rate which once booked could not be cancelled at any stage). Anyhow the bottom line was that I was willing to pay a little more than initially anticipated to guarantee a nice standard of room in this 4* hotel. When I saw our room I was disgusted - definitely not what was advertised via internet - it was small, old fashioned & dull although the rooms were clean and cleaned on a daily basis. There was the usual overpriced mini-bar which we emptied and re-stocked with our own shop bought necessities for the duration of our stay. The staff were absolutely lovely - the barman was great craic!..although the bar itself lacked atmosphere. Breakfast was not included in our deal and with those prices we certainly had no interest. However, we did eat from the bar menu 3 times in the hotel - 1 - Spag Bol..ordered after the 11pm cut-off so we were very grateful for them to accomodate us and didn't really expect anything to be prepared from scratch. 2 - Coq au vin..we are both convinced every item on the plate was microwaved - it killed me to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17.50 each - awful!! 3 - room service again of burgers & curly frys - again burger appeared microwaved. We were 99% convinced that there was actually no chef on duty with regard to food available on the bar menu. Thankfully, we did locate a gorgeous italian restaurant about 5 mins walk around the corner - and the bonus was that it was great value for money. I would personally be very slow to stay in the Memphis Gresham again. Overall the standard of room and quality of food by no means represented that of a 4* hotel. Way overpriced - and at that I'm even talking the cheaper \"hot deal\" that we availed of.

We felt slightly put off by a few of the reviews before we booked but could honestly say that our experience of both the staff and rooms were nothing but excellent. Nothing was a problem, yes you do have to ask for the tea making facilities and also travel adaptors (which was not a problem) and both were easily forthcoming. The room we had was of a good standard, very clean and peaceful at night - what more could you ask for for such an affordable price. To get into town you can either take the no. 16 tram (just outside the hotel) or take a lovely walk (not too far), if you take a left outside the hotel and carry on walking until you get to the right side of Vondel Park there is the exclusive shopping area of Amsterdam (close to the museums). Absolutely fabulous!! and its also close to the museum and casino (great fun).

We booked to stay from last wednesday through to this tues, the rate for each day varied from 80Euros to 150Euros, however on the last night (monday) they were going to charge us 210Euros for Monday night, so we left sunday and found a hotel on the dam for 80Euros - there was no way i was going to pay that. When we arrived it was very late and the check in was all smooth. we took the lift to our room and found it said no smoking in there but had an ashtray - we smoked in there anyway. There is also a mini bar - we just took the water out and stored our own drinks in there. There are tea & coffee making facilities available for free - you just have to ask for it everyday - all the sachets come in a little box. And just keep the kettle in the room. The same goes for an iron - just ask. The towells are really worn so take your own, i have to say this hotel has the best shower i have ever used! mega power shower. The food in the hotel is overpriced and disgusting- my partner had a childs portion of spag bol for 12.50 and i had a burger and curly fries- i didnt eat it and complained and the waiter (a young indian guy with glasses) said i shouldnt complain and nobody ever had before, he said it must be me & that id still have to pay for it. My partner went mental, the waiter was so rude we were gobsmacked! The receptionist (with long blonde hair) overheard us complaining and instead of helping lit up a cigarette with her back to us. When we were checking out they said we'd drank stuff out of the minibar, but we asked them to check it and they apologised for the mistake. One day we wanted a lie in so put the do not disturb sign on the door and the maid still knocked the door, we said we'd be 20 mins and they knocked again another 2 times. Our room was fine - the equivilent to a novotel, travel lodge or an ibis in england. It was just the manner of the staff which i found was a real let down, you just get the vibe that they dont want to help you. They could do with a few lessons in customer service! The location was fine though, there are so many trams in amsterdam! To get to/from there to the central station/dam it's number 16 or 2 tram AND 1.60 Per person.

I arrived about 6:30 pm and was given a beautiful room, though it was non-smoking and I had requested smoking. The reception was polite if not apologetic. The next morning I attempted to resolve it and this member of staff treated me with restrained contempt. During the course of my stay her attitude improved, but as we all know first impressions are important. Anyway, five hours later they got me moved. The second room was nice and roomy enough, though not as nice as the first room. If you are a non-smoker, definitely request room 504, very nice, just like the pictures on the website. As I had to cancel the last night of my stay, was told I would have to do it through Easytobook.com where I made my res. This appears to be their official booking agent. Although I resolved the issue, it took me far more time than it should have, 3 days from my first attempt. Cancellation policy is 24 hours, but read the fine print and plan on 48+ hours to be safe if you need to cancel. Book directly with the hotel if you can get a good rate. My stay varied from 84 euro per night to 136 euro per night. I would not pay more than 100 euro per night on a repeat visit. Breakfast is VERY expensive for this class of hotel, 20 euro, as well as the DSL and wireless internet; 24 euro per day if I recall. Beds moderately comfortable, and pillows are great. Towels are sub-standard and well worn. Bring hair conditioner and face cloth if you use them. Both hair dryers were inadequate, again, bring your own. TV selection very good. Housekeeping very good though the first room I was not impressed with the hair in the bathroom; it happens. Coffee from the bar is fantastic , 2 euro each; there are no coffee making facilities in room. No ironing facilities in room. If you like being outside the hustle and bustle of the city center, but just 10 minutes away by tram, this location is great. Near museums for tourists and not far from Rai center for business travelers. Tram is 3 minute walk. On my next visit to Amsterdam I will look for a hotel in this area, maybe even stay at this one again if I cant find another. Most hotel staff need hospitality courses would be my main observation.

This road leads to Vondel Park. You can easily walk to Leidseplein (lots of bars and shops) in about 15 minutes. There is a tram stop a couple of streets up from the hotel which runs straight through Leidseplein, Dam Square/RLD, and up to the centre. Easy acess to main areas.

Our room was a satisfactory size, however we were slightly dissapointed with the decoration of the room, a bit old fashioned. We wouldnt have minded had we not read that it had been renovated recently; we assumed this meant the bedrooms also, The bed was comfy and clean, as was the towels and all linen. The bathroom was split into a room with a sink and bath/shower and one with a toilet. They were quite small but the tiles and decor was very clean and modern. Our room was cleaned daily, at which we were suprised as we like a lie in until dinner some days. The mini bar was stocked daily and contained about 10 mini bottles of alcohol, beer, water, coke, orange juice, pringles, tobelerone and a few more bits and bats. It was a very well stocked mini fridge. Breakfast was great.

I could quite literally understand the conversations in the rooms on either side of me. Because of that, I was unable to conduct some business I wanted in the room on the phone since they clearly could understand me too. Also the price of a single phone call was over 1 Euro. I was also a bit surprized by the clients; as I checked in, there were two British 20 somethings trying to check out, but they didn't have enough money to pay the bill! The clerk was the picture of politeness but was firm and showed them on their reservation sheets where the taxes and other fees have NOT been included in the price. Indeed when I checked out I was a bit surprised to find the price was about 20$ a night more than I had expected and I read all the fine print in those things (the difference was blamed on the exchange rate.... right....)
