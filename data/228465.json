Location The hotel is in the pretty Eixample district, which is not super touristy or tackly (like Las Ramblas and the Gothic quarter), so quite enjoyed that. The Diagonal metro station is half a minute away from the hotel \u2013 v handy. Also the Passeig de Gracia metro station is about 10 mins walk away. Gaudi\u2019s buildings (La Pedrera and Casa Battlo) are walking distance \u2013 5-10 mins away from the hotel. There 2 boulevards near the hotel (Passeig de Gracia and Rambla) have plenty of nice cafes. Rooms Very comfortable and nicely decorated. Especially enjoyed the small touches \u2013 little chocolates on our pillows, free water, an umbrella to use during your stay. I\u2019ve read on the forum that you can hear the subway (as the hotel is above the subway tracks) - we had a room on the 1st floor and was aware when a metro would pass underneath, but couldn\u2019t say it was disturbing. Service Front desk were nice and friendly. Also I specifically asked for a room with double bed and we got one on arrival \u2013 I was pleased they did their best to fullfil customer\u2019s requests. Breakfast Did not have breakfast at the hotel, but instead went to the pastry shop just opposite the hotel. Garden The have a big garden at the back, I imagine this is quite nice during the summer Other Because of works near the hotel (we were there for the weekend when there was no work going on, so weren\u2019t disturbed by the works) it was quite difficult for the taxi driver to find the temporary entrance to the hotel\u2026Would suggest asking the hotel exactly how to get there.", "Date": "November 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cLoved It\u201d", "Author": "Izzybee", "ReviewID": "UR21577522", "Content": "Unfortunately we only had two nights in Barcelona, but, fortunately we were able to spend them at the Gallery Hotel.

The metro is very close to the hotel and my advice is to buy a T10 ticket for 7.20 euros ( this is for 10 single trips and you can use the ticket on the bus as well as the train ) If you are only going to Barcelona for a few days make the most of your stay and get a ticket for the city tour bus( 20 euro's for one day ticket & 26 euro's for 2 days ) this way you will get to see all the main sights and you can hop on and of when you want, The zoo is a must to visit, it's one of the best i have been to", "Date": "October 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and service\u201d", "Author": "McGherks", "ReviewID": "UR21110237", "Content": "This hotel situated at a great location!

There is also a lovely little bakery across the street that is great for breakfast or lunch. I booked my room through Expedia, but emailed the hotel directly to confirm my reservation and give them my room preferences. They were very quick to respond and made sure I had a quiet room, with a king bed that was non-smoking. I checked into room 405 and it was exactly what I had asked for. The rooms are beautifully decorated and comfy. The bed was very comfortable and not as firm as some of the other hotels I stayed in during my time Spain. The linens, towels, robes and slippers are all of nice quality. They have safes in the closet that are free of charge. The safe is larger than most and will easily accommodate a laptop. The mini bar was well stocked, but a little on the pricey side for the level of hotel. The room service is tasty. It is 24 hours, but after midnight they only serve sandwiches. I found it to be reasonably priced. The CD player is a nice touch and they provide a nice relaxing music CD for you. The bathroom amenities are probably the best part of the hotel. I was shocked how many items they provide (i.e. razor and shaving cream, toothbrushes and toothpaste, etc.) NOTE: Even with all the extras they do provide, they do not have conditioner or body lotion. You will need to bring your own. The hotel has a nice business center with two computers and a printer. It is really handy and free of charge. It is great for checking in online and printing out your boarding passes. The hotel called me a cab for an early morning flight and they were very efficient and helpful. The cab to the airport cost 25 Euros. The location of the hotel is a little farther to some of the tourist areas than other hotels. However, there are several metro stops near the hotel and the metro was really easy to use. It is also on the line that takes you to the FC Barcelona stadium. If you are going to Barcelona for a football match...this is a great place to stay. It is really convenient to the Camp Nou. Overall, this is the kind of hotel I love.
