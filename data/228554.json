Overall a good experience. Would have been great if the bed were a bit more comfortable and the TV was not so old and with so few channels. SERVICE - No complaints whatsoever. Lovely. A couple of very brief issues with wireless internet access were easily resolved with a quick call to the front desk. ROOM - Spacious, basic accommodation. Very nice bathroom (though clearly the lighting was done by a man - haha!) The bed was a bit uncomfortable for me - I prefer a softer mattress than this. After the first night, I took the sofa cushion and put it under the fitted sheet for added softness. The television was VERY old (probably late 1980s) and the remote did not work, plus I think there were a total of about 15 channels and only CNN in English. I brought my iPad so this was no big deal, but I thought it was worth mentioning anyway. BREAKFAST - A nice buffet, good coffee, open from 7:00-11:00 AM (included). LOCATION - Attached to a nice little shopping mall. Outside the center of town, but I found it very easy to get around Barcelona. I bought a 4-day unlimited pass for the Metro for around $25 Euros. Several people mentioned that they thought the hotel was too far from the subway stop, but I disagree. You can get to the subway from the hotel by turning left on your way out the door and walking about 10 minutes... OR (much easier/faster), go outside the hotel and a little to your right - southeast - and just across the street (well, actually halfway across the street) on your right there is a stop for the Tram. Get on the Tram going toward the Maria Cristina Metro stop. DINING NEARBY - Obviously there are a million great places to eat in Barcelona, but sometimes you are looking for something close to the hotel. I had dinner one evening at Piscolabis and it was quite good - just walk outside the hotel and take a left; walk about 5 minutes and it is right there next to the Starbucks. Good tapas, nice wine. I also had lunch one afternoon at the mall and it was not bad at all - just walk outside the hotel and take a sharp left turn into the mall; through the walkway at the back there are several little cafes with decent food and good people-watching.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cClean and good service, but not much else to recommend it\u201d", "Author": "ln2inSegovia", "ReviewID": "UR126666223", "Content": "We stayed here for work for 2 nights in March. The hotel is fine, but has little to recommend it. As people have mentioned: once you get beyond the lobby everything is really dated, chipped, and a little tired. The lobby isn't any great shakes either, but it is a fresher looking than the rest of the hotel. I didn't try the breakfast, so I don't know if it any better (or if it is even in the price of the room). For me, the worst was that it was impossible to get fresh air anywhere. In the hotel rooms, the windows are locked shut. And, the air conditioner made a lot of noise, but produced very little air. In the conference room, they apparently couldn't cool it down (with the air conditioner), so they resorted to opening the one door into the room (out onto the non-useable). This still didn't provide much relief. Furthermore, the hotel is short hike to the closest subway station (maybe a 10-15 minute walk). It's not far, but with bags etc, it's too far for comfort. Lastly, I didn't compare with other hotels, but 108/night seemed a little steep for what you got (although I think you can get internet deals for as low as 88/night - but am not positive). That being said, there are some aspects that could recommend it depending on what you are looking for: (i) the rooms are huge as is the bed, and the bathroom is old-school nice (marble walls, spacious, highish ceilings) - although of course, dated (ii) the rooms are quite clean. Although tired and dingy-looking, the cleaning service is thorough (even fully making the bed the next day - often I find hotels don't fully make (e.g., tuck in the sheets completely)) (iii) the front desk tries to be accommodating - e.g., the second night we couldn't bear the stuffy room, so my husband begged that they open the window - and so they came with the key and after we promised not to jump or throw things out the window, they opened it... and it was luxurious. (iv) the location is interesting and could be very good under certain conditions. If you're not familiar with Barcelona, the hotel is a pretty far outside of the main tourist areas (with the exception of Camp Nou - which is right down the street). To get to the Rambla you have to walk to the subway station (10-15 minutes) and then take the Line 3 for 7-9 stops (15 minutes) to get to the Rambla. However, it IS IN the heart (I mean literally in the middle) of a shopping complex that extends for several blocks. If you like to shop, there's a lot there (check the website for the list of stores: http://www.lilla.com/ca/). Furthermore, if you have kids this could be a great solution - as there is decent playground and open space behind the hotel. It has a smallish playground, a basketball court, and an AWESOME set of trampolines (fee-based) for kids. Furthermore, there appeared to be a gym of some sorts with sports like tennis, etc. there as well. Lastly, if you like to run, the opposite side of the street seems to be the main thoroughfare for runners(bikers) in the am. The blocks are long, the sidewalks are flat and wide (and there's a bike path), and in the morning it is in the sun. So, it looked like a good city run option (although I'm sure running down by the water is probably nicer :)). Furthermore, the area has a number of food options - not high end or particularly notable, but easy (many are child-friendly) and with decent food. I probably wouldn't stay here again, but if I wanted to stay in the area, I might consider it (although there is a Marriott reopening down the street and there is an NH right behind, so there might be better options).", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "maryland", "Title": "\u201cOutdated without amenities\u201d", "Author": "naga78", "ReviewID": "UR126625099", "Content": "I recently stayed at Husa L'illa for 5 nights.

I just returned from staying at the Husa L'illa Hotel in Barcelona and came away disappointed. DO NOT BELIEVE EXPEDIA RATINGS. This is NOT a four-star hotel. This is the second time I have booked a room via Expedia and have been disappointed. A three-star for this hotel is pushing it. I am sure in its day, the hotel was considered a luxuary hotel, but this hotel has seen better days. The hotel is tired and dingy and so is the staff (except for one young gentelman with a pony tail who was very eager to answer questions), the other older gentleman did not seem like they wanted to be there. They did not go above the simple yes and no questions. When I asked if the hotel had a fitness center, I was told no but there was one a few blocks away. When I got to the fiteness center, I was told I needed to come with a member or have the hotel give me a pass. This was never offered to me when inquiring about the gym. Needless to say, I had to go back and ask for a pass, which cost $15.00 and return to the gym. Not a big deal, but that's the difference between a good hotel and a not-so-good-hotel--the details. Also, since guest can SMOKE anywhere they please, the hallways and room have an antiseptic smell to cover up the odor of an ashtray. The windows in the hotel do not open so there is no possibity for fresh air. As for breakfast (not included), you are better off going to Starbucks across the street. Not worth the money. I will say, the location is great and you are very close to the Metro, which is very easy to use. The last time I was in Barcelona, I stay in the Ramla area. Too much a circus for me. This is a much better location and only four or five stops on the Metro. The Mall next store offers a lot of diversion and a few eating establishments. Make sure you go to the lower level where there are many eateries. The Hilton Barelona is only one block away and it looks very nice. I had a drink at the bar. Husa L'ills doesn't have a bar and only one computer which you pay to use by the minutes. I would guess that the Hilton is more money, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.
