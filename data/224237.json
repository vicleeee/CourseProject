{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Dirty place that did a bait  Booked a room online via their website months ago since had to work in dallas during this month. Book a single bed room, they gave me an email confirmation with price and all. Confirmation states room requested may not be available. should be first clue.Arrived at property to find out they tried calling me day of arrival to tell me they did not have my type of room available, in fact have not had a 1 bed room for available for 4 weeks. Questioned them about why they did not call me before today about this issue as I would have gone somewhere else. She offered me a bigger room. Only problem it would cost much more. I demand the price I had a reservation confirm for, they offered it to me for 1 week then they would charge me roughly $50 more per week. Told the General Manager this was unacceptable, I wanted my reservation rate and I got a steadfast NO.Long story short, rooms are small, smaller than a standard hotel room in fact. 2 bed room has no desk or couch, where are you supposed to sit when you are in this place long term?? Also hotel corridors were filthy, smoke filled, stained carpet not to mention the room they tried to give me. Avoid this place like the PLAGUE!!! I left, did not stay even though I arrived the day before I started work in Dallas and driving 250 miles. Went and had to find another place. Not worth the $$ at all.", "Date": "Aug 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR741260085", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "teninepit"}, {"Content": "not recommended I resided at Intown Brookriver for at least seven months longterm and do not recommend any length of stay. Grounds and parking lot were continuously littered with trash, but cleaned every morning. Elevator was out of service for 3 days which was excessive (I was on the third floor). Housekeeping was marginal and inconsistant with a continuous change in staff. Common practice was to leave a note in your room that it would not be cleaned due to circumstances byond our control. That would imply management was not in control of their business. Vending machines furnished by contractors were not maintained adequately often in direpair or out of stock. The guest laundry room is apparently for the convenience of the hotel. While the hotel provides limited linen service, their practice is to pull your sheets once a week, take them down to the coin operated laundry, launder and return them to your room later in the day. Apparently they do not have a rotational stock of linens. Often on my designated cleaning day I would be disturbed by maid service three different times for linen gathering, room cleaning then linen return/bed makeup.. As the facility does not have their own separate laundry, the guest coin facility has limited hours for guest use while laundering your linens. Hours were always inconsistant and the prices uncompetitive for the times and equipment offered.. Management informed me they purchased and operated their own equipment (with an increase in pricing to guests during my stay). Upon move out I discovered my digital camera had disappeared and calls to the manager and district manager had not been returned. While most hotel policies may state to check valueables in their offices, storing your laptop, cellphone, cameras are unrealistic, especially when their office hours are limited to 11am to 7 pm 6 days a week.", "Date": "Aug 8, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR181749812", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "wuff"}, {"Content": "Don't leave valuables in the room If you would like your computer equipment and beer stolen - leave them in the room - somebody will come and take them for you.Staff will not care about the thief - most likely because they are in on the hiest.

The room was great. When we checked in they had our reservations ready. The manager was very polite and during our over 4 week stay he helped with any problems we had. The clean up crew as great. The location was right by the freeway and easy access to where we needed to go.
