I was a little bit concerned about the area, which in turn made me apprehensive about the hotel. I was very pleasantly surprised to find my concerns about the area and the hotel completely unwarranted. Let's start with the hotel: Very nicely appointed rooms, very comfortable beds, and very clean. It almost seemed like it was newly remodeled. Bathrooms include heated bidets with very complicated instructions - I didn't even try - but they looked cool. The high school kids were a little confused until I told them they were butt-washers, and then they just nodded and changed the subject. I had street-side windows, and any noise that got through was reasonable for downtown LA in the early evening. Then it got really quiet. In fact the only time noise bothered me at all was when it got so quiet (middle of the night) was a garbage truck beeping - for-ev-ver. (But that's not the hotels fault.) Room (7th floor) had a nice view of the San Bernadino mountains. The rest of the hotel facilities appear minimal - no gym, pool or anything like that. Big plus for free wifi and only $1 for the bottled water. It was refreshing to stay somewhere where I didn't feel like they were trying to turn the last screw. I found wonderfully tawdry bar on the second floor with a karaoke thing going on -obviously full of locals who take Karaoke -very- seriously! They have some sort of spa, but it's not a general use thing. No pool as far as I could tell. Down one star because of the absurdly over-priced breakfast buffet (albeit with some sort of asian flair). It was the only dining choice, and I wasn't quite ready to venture out. I could have used a simple breakfast. Didn't have that choice. The hotel staff was friendly and efficient, however the bar staff could have been a little more attentive. I had a friend meet me for a few drinks, and we had a lot of difficulty getting a second drink even though we were actually sitting AT the bar. The rest of the staff, including the front desk, valet, and concierge, heck even the housekeeper, were very helpful and friendly. (The housekeeper gets an extra ++ for checking with me about the rooms after realizing I was chaperoning kids). OK - the area: Downtown LA, a few blocks from City Hall. Metro station is just a short walk away and it only took 20 minutes or so to ride over to Hollywood to do the tourist thing. The Disney concert hall is within walking distance.There are starbucks coffee bars in every direction, but I'd head south one block and then go west. Seems to be a revitalized area with restaurants, shopping and bars in one of those hip condo live-walk-work communities.

My hotel needed to be in LA proper/central: my choice was Miyako or a hotel near the LA Live area (very touristy).

The Miyako is one of the most centrally located hotels in the city, in the middle of Little Tokyo on First Street. From here you have easy access to the 101 and 5 freeways, downtown Los Angeles directly west, the arts district to the east, and the bars, restaurants and shops of J-Town all around you. The Metro Gold Line is literally 1 block away and connects to Union Station minutes away for access to all Metro services. It's one of the only hotels in the city that you can reach directly from LAX, Bob Hope or Ontario airports without even looking at a car. The hotel itself wasn't that great considering the price. I suspect if you pay for something more than the standard room I got, it might be nicer, but for the money I frankly expected a little higher quality.The second day of my stay there were maintenance guys working on the room across from mine, so I suspect it's clear to the owners the hotel is overdue for improvements. The hotel has the look and feel of a western-style hotel in Japan, with Japanese touches from the outside architecture to the room accents. My room on the 9th floor faced the Little Tokyo mall, and had the rare and welcome feature of an openable window. You can let in a breeze flavored with mingled scents of charbroiled teriyaki and the wild anise that grows downtown, which I totally enjoyed. The first thing I noticed about my room was that the door stuck. I went in and out often and each time it took three tries to force open the door. I had to master a technique and really put my shoulder into it. The room was pretty small, but managed to feature a really comfortable California king bed, a serious desk with drawers for storing your stuff and a comfy, stylish office chair. The lamp on the desk is not glaringly bright, provides a nice glow and yet is useful for reading and paperwork. Both sides of the bed feature generous night stands topped with Japanese-styled lamps. There is a long hanging Japanese paper lamp by the window that works on a reostat, making the room very atmospheric. The curtains over the window are bordered by wooden Japanese lattices that evoke a little Japanese ryokan feel. The closet is in the foyer behind a mirrored sliding door and is spacious. There is also a coffee service in a small recess adjacent to the closet. It sits on top of a heavy wood cabinet that houses the mini-fridge. There is no wireless access in the hotel except on the 2nd, 3rd and 11th floors and in the spa. I try to be objective in my reviews, but it's 2011 and they need to change that. Nobody carries a DSL cable around with them for their laptop. The bathroom is in need of remodeling, but is clean and functional. The door jam and walls are rife with nics and pitting around the corners from years of use. the toilet is awesome and like those in Japanese hotels features a bidet and heated seat. The shower has good pressure and a hand-held shower head to accommodate all heights. I paid one visit to the spa for a shiatsu massage and to check out the facilities. The bath and shower area are in need of maintenacne but again, are well-maintained. It kind of feels like an old familiar YMCA. Paint chips off the walls and old stubborn grime surrounds the doorway of the wet sauna. I was a little timid about taking off my spa sandals except for in the shower. The shiatsu massage was great and a good deal. Guests get a $10 off coupon so my 45-minute massage was $65 including the tip. A massage includes use of the entire facility which is a $20 value. The gym is small but really who cares about a gym in a hotel? There are lounges set up in the waiting room outside the massage room as well as outdoors on a small patio shaded by a wooden lattice and decorated with flowers and plants: a really nice feature. The massage room is totally relaxing, cool and comfortable and smells great. I wanted to visit the restaurant but didn't make it. The Tamon restaurant is run by the same company that owns Daikokuya and Ebisu here in J-Town and elsewhere, so I suspect it's delicious. The lounge features a full bar and karaoke, which I will experience if I stay here again. The little cafe in the lobby, Take 5, is a great place to chill. I'm sitting at a table outside it on the street as I write this. The coffee's good and the espresso drinks are okay. They have sandwiches and snacks, and a continental breakfast deal that's worth the money. There's comfortable seating inside and out and you can sit there and read or just hang out as long as you want. The staff with whom I interacted - mainly the front desk people and the spa attendant - were polite. I cannot go so far as to say friendly, but hey, polite works for me too. I did, however, feel more \"accommodated\" than welcome. If it weren't for my attempts to sort of cajole them, it would be hard for them to crack a smile. This isn't necessarily a criticism. It might just be the style of service the Miyako offers. Being sort of \"left alone\" is kind of nice. You can come and go as you please just like it's you're own apartment. However, compared to my experiences in Japan in general, I'm used to not only very friendly service but very friendly people in general. The Miyako is worth the stay for the location alone. I'm willing to overlook its faults in return for having downtown Los Angeles at my feet.

Parking next door in the Little Tokyo garage was very inexpensive on weekends, and at one exit time it was even free - no attendant was there when we left Sunday morning. The restaurants of the adjacent Little Tokyo shopping center were delicious, and wonderful for a mid-day snack or a full meal. We were in town for a show at the Ahmanson at Music Center, whjch was a short walk away - so no need for parking hassles at the theatre! We also walked to the gorgeous downtown YMCA for an excellent workout (the spa at the hotel was closed for renovations). Note that this particular YMCA charges guests a nominal fee, even if you have an AWAY sticker on your YMCA card. We were also able to get around the freeways easily from that location in L.A. (even though it was Carmageddon weekend), and took day or evening trips to Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Griffith Park, and Pasadena. We used the Burbank Airport instead of LAX, which was VERY convenient.

The buffet in the restaurant is a utilitarian mix of American (eggs, bacon, sausage, etc) and Asian (rice, congee, natto, etc). Not at all fancy, but fine.

I blame the staff who cared little for the comfort of guests, and acted as if having to interact with patrons was a big interruption to their casual conversations. My room had no heat, and I tried to switch rooms a few times, to no avail. They insisted on fixing the furnace, which was fine when the heat first stopped working, but was nonsensical by the third time! The staff even sent the bellman one morning when I woke up freezing -- and he tried to make up an excuse by saying that I didn't know how to use a thermostat, which was absolutely wrong and insulting. I gave up asking for a new room, and sat in coffee shops for warmth. LA had unusually cold temps, but that's still no excuse for not having a functional heater. To make matters worse, my room smelled like mildew and old trash. I should have switched rooms just for that (they ignored that request too), but I discovered by wandering around that the ENTIRE hotel had an old, unclean smell to it, like trash, cigarettes, and mildew. Housekeeping comes by early, and if you are not ready for them by 10:30am, they stick a nasty-gram under your door. Of course, I wasn't planning to be in my room that much, considering the cold and the smell, but on the two occasions I decided to return after breakfast to make a phone call and pick up some items, they let me know that I was not welcome to linger. Also, there were only two pillows on the bed, no extra blanket, and I could not get more when I asked the housekeeping staff. Parking is not easy, but be careful! The front desk will tell you it's cheaper to park with them, but if you park in the Little Toyko Mall parking garage, which is the SAME BUILDING, they will charge you less than half of what the Miyako charges. It cost me $62 for 8 days of parking; the Miyako was going to charge me $136 ($17/day for self park, $24/day for valet). What makes me frustrated most about the stay is not the poor service at the front desk, but the lost opportunity. The hotel could have had so much to offer. The shiatsu massage was one of the best I've ever had, though the spa was dirty and the reception was not very helpful and seemed stressed. The cafe in the lobby was convenient and offered good food and service. Even the gift shop clerk was friendly and nice. Best of all was the location -- in the heart of Little Toyko, it's close to public transportation, downtown activities, a huge selection of restaurants, and has a wonderful view of city hall. I enjoy the Japanese culture and was looking forward to this visit. It's a shame that the Miyako Hotel had such poor execution. I am a quiet, respectful guest who never complains and I travel frequently on business. This is the first time I felt motivated to write a review and warn others.

I am not a big fan of the neighborhood around the LA convention center because there's really a lack of a neighborhood feel around it. Also, there is a lack of reasonable food options around the convention center. Instead of staying too far from the convention center, we decided to stay in Little Tokyo, which is relatively close to the convention center. Being a big fan of Japanese food and culture, it was a perfect solution to our problem. The hotel itself, however, was not as nice as I hoped. Basically, we got what we paid for. Our room was clean and relatively functional, but was very small. No special amenities. The doornob, I think, was in need of repair. However, free internet access was great. We had a great government rate deal (I workk for a public benefit corporation for the state of New York) which included a room, free internet, free \"continental\" breakfast, and a visit to their spa. However, by no means we felt \"unsafe.\" In terms of safety, I would feel much less safe around the convention center. If this hotel was located in a boring neighborhood, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. However, for those who will be going to LA for a convention, I highly recommend staying at Miyako instead of any of the typical \"convention hotels.\" The hotel is centrally located in Little Tokyo, more centrally so than other hotels. We found too many wonderful places to shop and eat around the hotel than any other hotel we have ever stayed in our travels. We had breakfast mainly in their \"Take 5\" lobby cafe, but we tried the Japanese style buffet breakfast in their 2nd floor \"Tamon\" restaurant twice. The breakfast was pretty good, since it was either part of the package at \"Take 5\" or discounted at \"Tamon.\" However, I think it is sort of silly to stay in the hotel for your food, since there are a lot of options just outside the hotel. Also, the hotel is very close to a couple of museums (Japanese American National Museum and MOCA Geffen), both of them are worth visiting. The spa area on the third floor is clean and nice, probably not the nicest spa I have been to. I may not recommend it unless it is \"free.\" There is a coin operated laundry area, also on the third floor. In summary, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who needs to stay in downtown LA, especially for conventions. What Little Tokyo offers more than makes up for a old and tired look of the hotel, as well as their quirky customer service.

The tub's grout was stained and chunks were missing, too. It wasn't anything that made my stay horrible or anything, but it did let me clearly know that I was not in a true 3-star property.

Good: +Quiet and clean room +Reasonably priced +Room is great for singles, couples, etc +Wireless +Nice white duvet with down comforter +Subway station: 4.5 blocks to Civic Center Subway Station (can get to Hollywood/Universal in 20mins) +Close to financial district\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcan walk or take modern city shuttles for 25 cents +Unique area-Little Tokyo +Coffee shop within 1.5 blocks-Starbucks (at New Otani Hotel) +Japanese supermarkets nearby offering snacks, bottled water, alcohol and other foods +Staff were friendly and helpful +Nice lobby and corridors +Airport Flyaway Bus to/from Union Station for $3 (Union is one stop from Civic Center Station or you can walk from the hotel in approx. 15 minutes. There is also a metro bus that can be taken close to the hotel that goes to Union station for $1.25) Poor: -Shower was not of hotel standard, although the rest of the washroom was fine. Later I didn't worry much about the shower-wasn't such a big problem. -Lack of restaurants except for Japanese ( but this is understandable for the area being Little Tokyo. Some of these restaurants were only so-so. Other notes: Some travelers mentioned about the homeless in the area. I did see about 4 a day walking by but they kept to themselves. Basically, the area is not that bad at all but I imagine the further east you go, for example East 4th street and San Pedro, it may be a different story yet there is really no need to go to that area. The funny thing is even in Beverly Hills I saw a homeless man, so go figure. Also, I read from others that the beds are very firm. The truth is that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a little on the firm side but not as much as one would think by reading these posts. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely true for your back to sleep on more of a firm bed than an overly soft one. And, I actually did sleep very well.

I don't think their restaurant or breakfast was great for the price but don't eat at the hotel as there are many restaurants in Little Tokyo just around the corner.

The 'negs' put me off. Then I went to Priceline and what did I get? Miyako Hotel. We arrived around 8pm dreading the no non-smoking rooms if late checkin - What were we met with? Pleasant, cheerful and helpful staff from the car valet, to the concierge and to the desk man. I handed over my Priceline reservation - asked for a non-smoking room and off we were. Nice room - standard layout but with good lighting fixtures, comfy beds- the window even opens. The reason I write tonight is to counter the negs I read earlier: This is a clean and professionally run hotel. Its LA and there have always been interesting street people around. The few street folk we did encounter [only 1 near the Miyako] where actually polite and could be buzzed of easy if that was what you felt like doing.] There is not a liquor or beer store on the block. Litte Tokyo is a nice block and if you walk a bit [go to right exiting hotel] you enter a 'Japanese' street ' actually part of the mall/office complex which makes Little Tokyo all the larger. Another minute down the street a nice Cuban restaurant and next door to it a tendy micro brewery. This is a GOOD location. From my 2 day experience with this hotel I cannot say anything negative [ there was an impending water shutdown - announced 2 days in advance in various notices and on the -'day of'- notes were slipped under every door advising of this '5 to 15 minute inconvenience' This is a professionally run hotel with a wonderful 100% pleasant and helpful staff.

Daddy like. I can't imagine bedbugs in this room. Look -- I upgraded (from the standard room booked through PL immediately upon checking-in) based on previous reviews, but honestly, I can't imagine a tiered level of service/accommodation here that could be that extreme. The obligatory list of cons (on the business tip): 1) No available outlets near the work desk. 2) When I'm done working, why can't I ever (in the Miyako, the Hilton, or the Hyatt) watch the few shows I enjoy on TV? It's 2006 -- why am I still limited to Discovery, Oprah and HBO? Sorry, that's an ongoing gripe. Death to OnCommand. That's it. I usually have a few more.

Take a Vegas casino and multiply it by 10,000 and you have the level of stench. Never have I encountered a worse smell. It would have been unbreathable, so we couldn't stay there. The hotel would not cancel the reservation or refund the money, but Expedia made good on the deal. No monetary loss, but it was 4pm and we had no room.

We got a cheap price on Priceline, thank goodness, as I would never pay full price for this hotel. I would be extremely upset if we had to pay more than our $50 on priceline. Our standard room was very plain, no decor on walls, just the headboards. I did check for bedbugs, but all seemed ok there-Shower heads are made for people on the shorter side, and bathrooms needed to be upgraded a bit. Peeling wallpaper, chipped paint in sink, and faucets didnt work too well. Could hear neighbors every time they took a shower or flushed toilet.The valet parking fee was high, $15, but so is all the parking in downtown LA, so I was expecting it. The one thing I did like was that the rooms had a DVD player, which was great for my 3 yr old. Staff was pretty friendly, the bellhop guy, who took our luggage up to our room, was extremely friendly, and even made us a map, with good,local sushi resteraunts.
