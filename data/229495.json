Great location for exploring the city without having to stay right in the centre. Near to all the art galleries and museums. Rooms were nice but a bit basic and functional, not a lot too them really.

Only one aspect of the hotel would have given a nice view of the city so try to get a room at the front of the building. Staff were friendly and helpful though they didn't even point us in the direction of our room let alone give us any help with our bags. Breakfast was overpriced. We walked into the sqare opposite the hotel for breakfast in the morning where the cafes and restaurants were excellent value.

The staff is very friendly. You immediately get a nice feeling in this hotel. But this hotel was perhaps top standard 10 years ago and may need an upgrade and refurbishing to stay in the top league. It is still very good though with nice and clean rooms with refurbished bathrooms. The bar is very nice with friendly staff as well. What may surprise someone used to visit other top standard european hotels is that internet access comes at a pretty high charge. This service is more often than not free at hotels like this in Europe nowadays. Another surprise is the high prices when you pay you breakfast if it is not included in the room charge. A standard breakfast with warm items like bacon etc is almost twice as expensive compared to for instance Radisson... But the hotel is in a very good location for Amsterdam sightseeing close to Rijksmuseum an the Van Gogh museum. You also have restaurants and shopping nearby.

On arrival, we checked in and were told that although we had booked a family room (2 king beds), they didn't have them available. Therefore, we had a queen bed with a foldaway bed. It meant that 3 of us would have to share the queen. To compensate, we were offered full breakfast for the 4 of us for the duration of our stay (3 nights) so we were happy to take the room. When having breakfast on the first morning, we realised we had saved a fortune as it wasn't cheap! The room (847) was clean and comfortable. I liked that there was a safe which you didn't have to pay for and we had tea and coffee making facilities. There was also an iron and ironing board as well as a hair dryer. When searching for a hotel in Amsterdam, I came across several 2* hotels which weren't that much cheaper than what we paid so I think we got excellent value for money. We ate in the Midtown Restaurant one night and the food was superb. It's a shame the service let the restaurant down. On arrival at the restaurant, service was very good but as they got busier, we were forgotten. For what we paid, I would expect better service. The hotel is in a great area, close to shops, restaurants and trams. We walked everywhere and you can't really get lost! We went on a one hour canal boat ride which cost 29 euros for 2 adults and 2 children. We didn't join it in the Leidesplein area, it was closer to L'hotel de Europe. We ate out in an Italian restaurant (Antonio's) and wouldn't recommend it. To say the food was bland would be an understatement! Amsterdam seems to be full of Italian restaurants.

We ate a couple of times in the Rancho Argentinian steak house.... very very nice and located directly across from the marriott and about 2 doors up from the burger king. Only thing I can critise the hotel for is the fact after a long day travelling, flight delays and arriving at the hotel late, it would have been nice to have tea/coffee facilities in the room, which is a bit of a surprise.

We arrived early, 10am, but our room was ready and they had upgraded us to an executive room on the 10th floor. The receptionist was very helpful and also recommended trips to make our stay special - I believe you can buy tickets to all the local attractions from the hotel concierge. Our room was very nice, clean and comfortable - the bathroom had a bath and shower and the usual complimentary toiletries. We left our bags, and went straight out to explore. There are plenty of things to see and do - but you will need to take plenty of money as everything is expensive. We enjoyed a 75 minute canal cruise which took in most of the sights and gave us plenty of ideas as to where to see on foot. After an exhausting day, we got back to the hotel and within minutes a knock at the door - a bottle of sparkles and strawberries as a anniversary gift - what a lovely surprise and how very thoughtful. Thank you very much! We found the bed to be very large and comfortable, and the room was very quiet - it was a great stay. We didnt have breakfast, so I cannot comment on this. The next morning, check out was efficient and again the staff were friendly and courteous. I would mention that I found the bike lanes and tram lines harrowing - if my children had been with us I would have had a nervous breakdown!! You really have to watch where you are walking at all times. The bike lanes which are not clearly marked will have hundreds of bike riders riding quickly most of the time, and in amongst them moped and small electric cars are also allowed - if you don't look, you stand a high chance of being knocked over....same goes for the trams. On our second day we decided to have a wander around the red light district - to see what all the fuss is about.....I didn't feel safe, lots of men in groups everywhere...women in windows with not alot on, and the high perfume of wacky backy in the air. We saw people walking through the sex shops and down these seedy streets with their children - totally unsuitable for any child in my opinion. As for eating and drinking, there are restaurants and bars all over - the further away from the crowds the better value for money you will get. If you want a top end restaurant I would book as the whole city was packed on the saturday night.

The executive lounge - very nice. Complete breakfast buffet and snacks/drinks after 5:00. A great perk if you can get access. The location - perfect.

Rijksmuseum Anne Frank House Red Light District Canal tour Rembrandt House The city is easy to get around in and you can walk to almost anything.

They faced an apartment building and had a limited view (out of the right side) of the Leidseplein area. I thought the rooms were fantastic. The mattresses, covers, and sheets looked brand new and very clean. My bed was comfortable, with soft pillows and I liked the tiny reading light that was attached to the headboard. Some hotel rooms appear dusty and these didn't. The only gripe I had was that a small set of glass shelves in the bathroom were dusty. Otherwise, the room appeared spotless. The closet (10 wooden hangers, by the way), contained a safe and an ironing board/iron. There was also ample drawers in a bureau in front of the bed. Yes, the service bar is a rip-off but it had a nice selection of snacks and drinks (at least 3 bottles of water available). I can't comment on the television or its capabilities, I never turned it on. The price for the wireless available in the lobby was outrageous and there is no wifi, only ethernet in the rooms, as many others on here have noted. I had no need of it but my traveling companions weren't happy about it. Evidently, there is a hotel nearby that has wireless and which makes their service available for purchase by credit card but its reliability was sketchy (2 bars) and service could drop off suddenly. The bathroom was modern and well-stocked with towels and toiletries. The shower was another matter altogether - sort of a hassle with its adjustable height. Also, you need to pull the knob above the faucet to turn on the nozzle and I managed to pull it right off of its resting place. Plenty of hot water. The grill downstairs is expensive but the food is very good. There was a good assortment of fruit, o.j., grapefruit juice, milk, coffee, tea. Scrambled eggs, oven roasted tomatoes, potatoes, baked beans (?!?), and then, on another table, pastries, bread and pancakes. Maple syrup must be an anomaly there, it had fairly become concrete in its jug. A very comfortable and bright restaurant, though. Dinner was phenomenal. The location is wonderful - within walking distance to many cafes, some stores, and the 9 streets shopping area. Also, the water taxi kiosk and its dock/pickup point is in walking distance (say, 2 minutes) from the Marriott's front door and you can buy tickets there. A few tips - Amsterdam is known for its rain. Bring an umbrella. Also, housekeeping will not try to enter your room if you leave the \"do not disturb\" sign hanging outside on your door. If you like massages, there is a place not too far away (maybe 10-15 min. walk) called Koan/Float, or some such. Try calling when you arrive, though, they were booked solid. Also, I was informed by the concierge that the hotel can arrange for a massage therapist (they have a 2nd floor area which is used for this purpose), with about 2 hours notice. There is a small gift shop downstairs with a limited amount of toiletries - tooth paste, etc. Everyone at the front desk, the restaurant, housekeeping and the gift shop were very nice. We stayed in the city during a time when many of the restaurants were closed. Because of this the restaurants that were open were jam packed. The concierge was the best. He called 4-5 different places one day in order to get us in somewhere.

The rooms are still very typically \"Marriott\" - more utilitarian than fashionable. The beds were awful - mattresses must have been so old and overused that when you got in them, the mattress sank in the middle and two of us rolled into the deep well in the middle. Not good for sleep. The towels, as usual, are thin, cheap and scratchy. There is no wifi in the rooms. You have to use the land line and then get a code you can use for wifi in the lobby - this is the 21st century people! Get with the technology program. AND, on top of that, it was slow and they charged 20 euros for 24 hours! Not worth it. Bathroom was on the small side, but toiletries were decent. Room had ample drawers for folded clothes. Closet was small and didn't have enough hangers. Room came with an iron/ironing board and a small safe to lock valuables. Room also had a minibar and free coffee/tea - however, I used the free morning cappuccino machine in the lobby - but you better run and get up early, for whatever cheap reason, they lock it up at like 8:30 in the morning. The doorman was very helpful one morning in pointing us to non touristy breakfast places. The evening concierge one night gave a great recommendation for a local, family owned Italian restaurant that was non touristy (it was amazing). The daytime concierge - not so great - recommended the predictable touristy locations even after I specifically said I didn't want that. For a city that has rainy weather often, one would expect the hotel has ample supply of umbrellas on hand, even if they need to charge a deposit to ensure they get them returned. Guess what - they didn't. Very very irritating when it's raining heavily and you want to go out and about. Check in and check out seemed fine.

Also, at the concierge desk, we asked to change some large notes into smaller ones and got some resistance which is uncharacteristic of a 5 star hotel. I realize they're not a bank, but they're a 5 star hotel in the middle of a tourist area...this should be a given for their guests.

Being a Marriott Platinum member and booked long time in advance I would have expected a bit more response to my needs. We wanted a high floor, king-bed. The lady gave us a room at the 5th floor with Leidseplein view. Because these room are very noisy during weekend nights I asked for a room at the backside (quiet side) of the hotel. This was only available at the 2nd or 3rd floor, limited view. I asked for a high floor room with 2 beds but it did not seem possible as well. The hotel did not look very full... So we decided to go for the room she gave us first at the 5th floor. We came into this room and as expected it was noisy (despite new windows), very dirty sheet, smelly. So, we went back to the front desk and we were given a room at the 8th floor, quiet side. All in all we were busy 45 minutes to have our room. Because we were arriving late due to heavy traffic I went to the executive lounge at 7.15pm to have a little snack for my daughter before the buffet closed at 7.30 pm. The lounge was very crowded, packed and very noisy. Lot of empty bottles, glasses, silverware etc on the tables. I found a table, went to the buffet finding out that everything was empty! It looked like it was attacked by wild animals!!!! Found some nacho's for my daughter...People took bottles of wine of the buffet to put them on their tables for refills.The very nice man who used to work in the lounge for several years and who is a familiar face did his very best and worked hard!! But is was too much for him alone! The lounge was very understaffed!

Its clearly not true that 'all hotels in the Netherlands do this' Best Western (just around the corner from the Marriot) recently announced free internet globally, because they estimate that these egregious charges are costing travellers over a billion dollars a year. In trying to squeeze revenue out of their customers (who are already paying a highish room rate) the Marriot has lost any repeat business from this customer. My low ranking also reflects this displeasure. If all Tripadvisor reviewers take the same approach and down rank hotels charging high rates for room internet access, maybe we can stop this dodgy practice. Having said above, its a great shame the Marriot spoils itself with this cheap shot. Its not a bad hotel. Staff training levels are high, its got a good central location,rooms are clean, functional and well serviced, there's is a real office chair in the room, so business travellers can work without struggling to peer over the top of the room's desk, the breakfasts more than adequate, curtains keep out light and aircon works, So come on Marriot, stop the silly internet charges.

Glad I did. Great hotel to come to after a 7 hr flight. We arrived at 6am and the lady who checked us in was super nice (wish I remembered her name) and found us an empty room with a city view without charging us extra. She even gave us a voucher for free breakfast for one day. Breakfast was a good variety. Room was nice and spacious with 2 double beds. I liked the location since it's in the outer canal belt...but close enough to a lot of sites. If you don't have a lot of luggage, don't waste your money on a taxi. You can easily take the 197 bus from the airport (think it was 4 euros which you can pay on the bus) to the Marriott. Get off at Leidesplein. It was about 30 mins or so. It drops you off about a block from the hotel. People said Amsterdam was a walkable city...I sorta disagree. It's walkable...but a pretty big city too so it tires you out. We started taking the tram everywhere instead which worked perfectly for us. The main trams were about a 5 min walk from hotel. There are lots of bars/restaurants all outside the hotel in the main area - Leidesplein. Good place to hang out and people watch. Vondel park is about 4 blocks away...nice park. We rented bikes for a day and went around the park. Amsterdam is a bike city...I think they have the right of way over pedestrians....took some getting used to crossing the streets with all the bikers whizzing by! We took a full day tour to see the windmills, volendam, marken, delft, the hague and madurodam. DON'T do a tour. It's seriously not worth the money ($80). The first half of the trip was ALL automated commentary! You only get about 45 mins per town to walk around which isn't enough. You can spend less than half that to do it on your own and at your own pace. I knew this, but we were short on time and thought we would learn a lot more from tour guides about each town. But you don't learn much through automated commentary. The towns are small enough to just walk around and enjoy. I regret not doing it on my own. But overall, I liked the different towns, especially Volendam. I also liked the Hague too b/c my friend who lives there took us to the beach which you don't see when you're on a tour.

Last time I was disappointed with the fact that there were no slippers. I still find it weird that they don't provide it. But to know that the hotel is one of the cleanest and most decent hotels in Amsterdam makes me forget it very easy. The rooms are large enough to accommodate 2 people with no problem. Enough storage place both in bathroom and living areas. The large drawers are very useful. Our room was on 4th floor facing the Leidseplein. Not fully form front side but rather form the small street side of the hotel. Very airy, nice room. Everything was very clean and proper, well maintained. The bed is amazing as always. This is one of the reasons I chose this hotel again. They are very very comfortable. The staff is very polite and helpful. Although one giant problem is the cleaning staff. The room cleaning seems to be the most important thing in this hotel. They do it based on their own schedule even \u00c4\u00b1f they do it on the expense of making you incredibly uncomfortable! They were knocking our door 5 times until 14:00 and we were very late to bed so we didn't want to go out very early. We didn't know that this would end up as very disturbing experience even though we had \"do not disturb\" sign at the door. And even after telling that we would be leaving soon (saying it while having wet hair and towel on) the were no later than 5 minutes to knock our door again. Except this harassment by the cleaning staff the rest of the staff is very polite. The hotel is located just opposite of the tram and bus stop. Bus 197 is bringing you from Airport directly to Marriott for 2 EUR per person. If I remember right it's every 20 minutes. It takes around 30 minutes with no traffic. The restaurants are around it's easy to choose them. But I would recommend Restaurant 't Zwaantje at Berenstraat 12, 1016 GH www.zwaantje.demon.nl This restaurant has all the perfect selection from traditional northern european food to some other international classics. But schnitzel and some dutch dishes are perfect. Beware of large portions. Reguliersdwaarstraat has many options for gay bars and clubs. Soho, Eve, Exit are to name few. Perfect for women, too. For little bit more luxe feeling Bump is a good choice for gays and all. Palladium is still packed in the evenings for good food and chic people.

The room was enough spacious for us with flat Tv, wardrobe, iron board, a desk and a mini-bar. Bathroom was moderately spacious and basically equipped with combined shower/bath-tube, hair-drier and furnished with average soaps and lotions. As Gold member I had free wi-fi and access to the Executive Lounge located at the ground floor (with access to member and one guest at time).

Breakfast was good and served in the Mid-Town Grill restaurant at the ground floor and there was several kinds of bread, cakes, cheese, sausages, salmon, eggs cooked to order, fresh fruits, tomatoes, potato meatballs, yoghurt, juices, tea and so on. After booking I emailed to Marriott to know about the possibility to buy Holland Pass directly from them, as I read on Holland Pass website.

There do not appear to be many hotels that have parking in downtown Amsterdam. This hotel, although parking is expensive, has safe, underground parking and we were allowed to park our car, and not have the valet do it. Our second criteria was that it be \"well located\" for touring Amsterdam, and such that we did not have to drive through the main part of the central area, where the streets are small and crowded. Driving into Amsterdam was no problem, using our GPS, other than finding the correct street to approach the hotel from the correct direction. Eventually we found our way in, but it did take awhile to accomplish this task. The hotel is also in a very tourist friendly location. We bought both the Hop On-Hop Off Boat Pass and a tram pass, and with both of them managed quite easily to go whereever we desired (other than the Library where there is FREE WiFi) which took a bit of walking. We also like to have a comfortable king size bed and decent size room. The Marriott provided both of these, although the rooms aren't huge, they are pretty big by european standards. We ordered room service breakfast a la carte on two days despite the. 6,50e for 2 small cups of coffee, so we wandered down to Starbucks for much cheaper, better coffee. It was only a 5 minute walk away. The only food we had in the restaurant was a piece of apple pie, which was supposed to be warm, but wasn't. There are plenty of places to eat without eating at the hotel (sorry Marriott). As we travel quite a bit, it isn't so important for us to stay in a hotel that is more representative of the town/city we are visiting all the time. If we hadn't had the car, we most likely would have stayed at a hotel on the canal. My only real complaint is the expensive internet. You can buy a package for 25e/day that includes internet and movies. You can buy partial days, but I think it was 7.50e for 30minutes.

The bedding was comfortable, the tub was large and the room was typical Marriott in its appointments. This property is a little more intimate than most full service Marriott hotels. It has a small lobby and lacks the hubbub associated with many Marriotts, which is a good fit for an Amsterdam hotel. Here are a couple additional observations: There is a single American outlet, located near the desk in the room. If you need to use any grooming devices near the sink, be sure to bring a converter. There are converters for sale in the lobby, but not to borrow for free. There is a bus (197) to/from the airport with a stop located steps away from the hotel. It costs 4 Euros. It couldn't be any more convenient. The tram stop is also near the hotel, making it easy to get most places most people would want to go and aren't walking distance from the hotel. Several posters complained about Internet access. WiFi was available for a charge, but there was an option allowing one hour access for a small fee. As a Marriott Rewards Platinum member, I was eligible for free access, which was fast and easy to use. I agree that Internet access should be included at no additional charge. The Executive Lounge, located on the first floor, had a good selection of hot and cold breakfast items and finger foods during happy hour. It was clean, but usually pretty crowded. There were enough seats for everyone there, but tables were very close to one another. If I weren't eligible for free access, I don't think it would be worth paying for access. We were talking to people in the lounge who had paid for access and felt as though they had gotten their money's worth, so I might be wrong. Unlike most lounges, there was no computers available in the lounge for Internet access or to print out boarding passes or tourist information.

We were just going to be staying in Amsterdam for 10 days and we decided we wanted the luxury of a large room and a private bathroom. We arrived at the hotel around 11am and was immediately helped. They do charge a 90 euro per night holding fee onto a credit card so you can use their services (internet and movies). This would have been 810 euros for us and they very nicely cut that down for us because that would have been a significant charge (which was our spending money). My friend is diabetic and she accidently left her blood sugar tester on the airplane. She asked the concierge on duty and asked if he could look up US Airways Customer Service number so she could call them. He was very rude to her and after several minutes he hastily wrote down a number, which when we tried to call was not a valid number. That was the ONLY proble we had during our stay. From then on, if we needed assistance we asked the bellhops. There was this one bellhop that was amazing (and I cannot remember what his name is for the life of me). He assisted us with great restaurants near the area and also where to find some Coffee Shops that were a more local favorite. We had to wait about an until we could get into our room, and we were extremely greatful for that since we had a long plane ride and arrived so early. We went to eat at their restaurant within the hotel and their club sandwiches are fabulous! Whenever we just wanted a bite to eat, it was very convenient just to go downstairs and eat a sandwich. Our room was absolutely fabulous. I still cannot believe how large the room actually was. It was just two of us, but it was perfect. The bathroom was huge! Everything was always clean and the housekeeping staff was so nice. We were so screwed up on our time that sometimes we just slept in and therefore the housekeeping staff would just slide a paper under our door stating that if we would like the room serviced, just to give them a call. So we would call them when leaving for the afternoon and when we arrived back home, our room was in tip-top shape. This hotel is not centrally located, it's on the edge of town by Leidseplein square. However, it is not a far walk to the middle of Amsterdam (about 15 minutes). My friend and I walked everywhere! And that's the best thing to do, because we just strolled along the cobblestone streets looking at buildings that dated back to the 18th century. It's only about a 10-15 minute walk to the Anne Frank House and very close to the market and everything. We absolutely loved this hotel.

While it's true there is wireless internet service in the building, it's been a long time since I've been to a business/tourist hotel (this seemed to be both) that did not have free wireless service in the lobby and/or bar area. The only free wireless service was in the executive lounge, which was at lobby level but had controlled entry and passworf controlled wireless access- and only for those with Marriott gold membership or higher. For anyone else, the only way to get wireless service in the lobby or bar is to pay for the service in your room- and only then were you given access elsewhere in the building.

All this investment speaks well to Marriott's intent to provide some very nice accommodation adjacent to Leidseplein and Vondelpark, two of the liveliest locations in Amsterdam. Nevertheless, when you check prices and Marriott's ranking of this as a Category 6 hotel, do not be led to think this is a luxury hotel by today's market standard. The Amsterdam Marriott is a lovely hotel, but rates over 175 euros per night are simply not competitive given the many other options in the area. Upon my arrival -- my first stay here for several years -- the place had a familiar sense about it. \u00c2\u00a0Surprisingly, I didn't find the doormen particularly friendly as I have found at the Amsterdam Renaissance hotel as well as others, where the greetings seem genuine. \u00c2\u00a0The ground floor layout is somewhat confusing for a weary traveler. \u00c2\u00a0After a minor diversion and a U-turn, I found reception. \u00c2\u00a0The desk staff were on the ball, though. The clerk easily accommodated my request for a check-in two hours early and even provided an upgraded room on the 11th floor. \u00c2\u00a0(Even though I'm an elite Marriott Rewards member, I often have difficulty with early check-in, about which many international travelers complain. Airlines and hotels seems to have different ideas about the need to sleep.) \u00c2\u00a0The clerk took my details, explained the differences in the hotel since my last visit, etc. I often make it a point to ask questions of hotel staff, in part to get a \"local\" perspective on the area, but also to gain a sense of how committed the hotel is to meet travelers' needs. This hotel passes the test, and the staff overall were very quick to share advice and information. My room was spotless, very comfortable, and well-equipped. The bedding was perfect for this weary traveler to rest up for a long journey home. As I said above, the lounge is really quite elegant with modern decor, yet I found it spacious and relaxing at the same time. For convenience, I had breakfast at in the lounge twice. The offerings were a bit meager, and I was surprised to find the overall quality and freshness only marginal. This is a huge faux pas in a city well-endowed with food suppliers. The hotel could do much, much better here. On the other hand, in the evening the staff and bartender in Sorel's Midtown Bar and Lounge served up some wonderful dishes and adult beverages with an international flare. Sorel's is cozy and casual, and I found it well-suited for either business lunches or as a launch pad before hitting the city at night. Location, location, location. Many trams crisscross Leidseplein, just across the street, for easy access to anywhere in the centrum. Taxis and even canal rides are a few steps from the hotel's front door. The hotel is within easy reach of Schipol Airport, too. Several options are available. When arriving, you can take a train from the airport to Centraal Station, then catch the 1, 2, or 5 tram and alight at Leidseplein. It can be a hassle to travel via tram with large suitcases, though, and the relatively new chipkaart system used on the trams will be confusing for newcomers. The Connexxion shuttle bus is another option, which costs 15 euros one way and takes about 30-60 minutes, depending on stops and traffic. I considered this when leaving, but the concierge at the hotel tipped me to an even better deal. There's an express bus (#370), which stops across the street and costs EUR 4.80 and takes out 30 minutes to/from the airport. The Renaissance Hotel used to be my favorite stop in Amsterdam, but after a couple of disappointments there, I decided to try the Amsterdam Marriott again. I was pleasantly surprised, and I will not hesitate to book there on my next trip, rates permitting. The location is unbeatable, especially for tourists, and the comfort level is a cut above.

The room was as we would expect, spacious, comfortable and all your needs covered. The beds were so comfortable, which was much needed after a 3 hour delay on our very early flight! As the hotel is out of the centre it was very quiet meaning we were able to have an afternoon nap to recharge our batteries before heading out for a first tour of the city.

The only downside we found was that two out of the four elevators were broken so the service down to the lobby was very slow...... we never did find the stairs down?!", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful location, and staff was nice, friendly & very helpful..worth it\u201d", "Author": "SwissAir100", "ReviewID": "UR95276512", "Content": "Just returned from a few days in AMS, and the Marriott is a good hotel especially for 1st time visitors. The location is fairly central, as it is close to many places like Vondelpark, Museum Qtr, Leidseplein & Rembrandtplein. The transit stops are so close to the hotel, that getting to Centraal Station & Dam Sq are just a quick few mins ride away - suggest getting passes esp. for those new to AMS & want to get around like the locals (if you don't rent a bike, ie). AMS is a very manageable city to walk in & the locals speak English & are very friendly. Requested early check-in, and was to able to get in @ 11:30 am (wonderful quality for a hotel in our books), which was desperately needed after a long flight trip. Concierge was helpful in making reservations as well as suggestions to see, eat & do. Front desk staff were just great, especially the NIGHT STAFF of JANUARY 30th. The young gentleman (name ??) helped us out as there were problems with their business printers, and he went above & beyond to help us print out our tickets. KUDOS TO HIM. The use of the Exec. lounge was great for complimentary sodas, wine & beer. The appetizers were also quite good. If you need something additional, just ask the friendly staff at the lounge, and they will do what they can to help you. Good restaurants on site, as well as very good room service. Health club is 3 levels and well equipped. You can also jog to Vondelpark a couple of blocks down for outdoor exercise. - Only two negatives we had (very minor tho) were the thin walls in our room...rest assured, we could hear a little bit more night time activity than we wanted to hear....Also, if you want to avoid the Leidseplein traffic noise Fri & Sat nights, request a room away from the front. However, other nights aren't as noisy. Secondly, the lack of wireless internet in the rooms - since Marriott caters to business people, we were surprised they didn't have that capability yet...But the new renovations to the lobby & rooms are great.

This is a nice hotel, it is considered a \"five star hotel\". This was a first for us, our style is more like a \"no star\" hotel, but we certainly can appreciate nice things. So, because the company was paying for the trip, we had a room on the 9th floor, which is considered the \"executive\" floor. With that \"perk\" came access to the Executive Lounge, which I will talk about later. The location of the hotel is very good if you are a tourist , since it is within walking distance to the Van Gogh Museum and the Rijkmuseum, as well as the Vondel Park and Leidesplein. Leidseplein is an area very close to the hotel where there are a large variety of restaurants, bars, Boom Chicago Comedy Club, and the music hall. You do have to walk about a block or so if you want to get the tram to anywhere else. If you are staying in Amsterdam for any length of time it is worth it to go the Tourist Bureau across the street from Centraal Station and buy a 7 day or more tram pass. You will save a lot of money, and can use the trams as many times as you want on those days. Just remember to swipe your tram card going into and exiting the tram, otherwise you are subject to a hefty fine by the tram police. The hotel does not sell tram tickets, nor apparently does the Albert Heijn supermarket. You can buy a one hour trams ticket on the tram itself but you will pay 50 cents extra for the privilege. I thought the hotel was too far away from Centraal Station, since I had previously lived in Holland and my interests this trip were to mainly get to Centraal Station to catch a train somewhere else to visit friends and family. (FYI, it takes about 30 minutes to get from the Marriott to Centraal Station). The hotel itself is very clean. We thought the concierge service was wonderful. I became quite ill on my third day in Holland, and needed medical care. Mark, the concierge (if I recall his name correctly) was very kind, calling up the doctor, arranging an appointment for me, then arranging for a taxi to get me there. I was very surprised to read other's reviews stating they felt the concierge was indifferent. My husband and I were looking for very particular restaurants to eat at, and the concierge came through for us every single time. Our room was very large. We had a gorgeous view. The room was quiet, and the bed was a pillow top, very comfy and luxurious with all its' pillows and duvet. The room was always very clean, and the staff would come before bedtime to see if we needed anything else and drop off chocolates, or some other light snack. The bathroom was large and well equipped with all the usual toiletries, as well as a hairdryer, and lots of towels, as well as a bathrobe and slippers. The bathtub was very large, and you needed to step carefully as it had a very high side. We had a coffee machine (which is unusual for European hotel rooms) and a tea service. There was also a small refrigerator. We had a very large closet as well as a ironing board and iron. There was a full sized work desk, a very comfy recliner, and a large dresser. Wake up service was always efficient. We used both the air conditioning and the heat, and both worked very well. I did not look at the exercise room, so I won't comment on that. We did meet friends at the bar several times, and the drinks were quite good, priced about the same as any other bar in Amsterdam. I did not eat at the restaurant, but my husband did several times with colleagues, and he said the food was very good. We did order room service a few times (once for burgers, believe it or not, which were overcooked) and dessert, which was very good). I don't want to forget to mention that you could always borrow an umbrella, which comes in handy in rainy Holland. The biggest \"perk\" as far as I was concerned, was the Executive Lounge. I ate breakfast in there every morning. My husband also ate in the regular dining room, since his colleagues wanted more than a buffet breakfast, but the dining room was very, very expensive. The breakfast in the Executive Lounge had everything you could want, cold cuts, all sorts of fresh bread and rolls, cheeses, herring, fruit juices, the best tea and coffee maker ever (it made frothing hot milk), eggs (hard boiled and what was probably powdered scrambled eggs). A huge selection of sodas and beers, all included in whatever you would pay for the executive room stay. There were daily newspapers to read, large screen tvs's to watch, comfy couches, and attentive cleaning people. The souvenir shop was actually better than most of the \"touristy\" shops downtown. It had a very nice selection of some interesting items we could not find anywhere else (for example, a \"delft style\" nightlight of a little dutch girl and boy kissing (you have seen it before) and the prices of the t-shirts were even slightly less than the other shops. Apparently there was free laundry service here as well, but we did not use that. Free coffee and tea is offered every morning. When we arrived at the hotel our room was not ready (since we came in from The States), but the concierge service very pleasantly stored all our baggage while we went out to visit family, and when we returned everything was ready for us. We both enjoyed the stay at this hotel. If it were in our price range (which I am sure it will never, ever be) we would stay here again.

No wireless internet in the room!! Grrr! Annoying!!! 2.) We brought our blow dryer from home and every time we used it - it triggered the fire alarm (though it's a silent alarm). Each time the security guard barged into our room (despite the fact that we weren't dressed) to check it out. This got VERY annoying VERY quickly. We had to keep the windows open each time & deal with the security team barging into the room. Also, the concierge could use some improvements- they were semi-helpful, but did not go out of their way to help us either with recommendations, calling a taxi or for directions.

We mainly chose the hotel because it was one of the few where we could share one room in three people. Apparently there are not many hotels offering triple rooms in Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The best feature of the hotel is the location - right between the historic centre and the Vondel Park. It is just perfect, you can walk everywhere. From the airport there is a bus (197) that leaves you in Leidseplein (2 mins from the hotel) and from the central station there are several tram lines going there, so it's easy to reach. As for the hotel itself, the room was fine, clean, the bed comfortable, TV channel choice ok. The service was adequate but from Marriot I expected more: although we specified in the booking that we would be three in the room and hence needed two double beds, upon arrival we were given a room with a queen bed and almost no space to put a rollaway bed. We complained, they responded that the two double beds are not guaranteed; we asked why do you accept a reservation for 3 people (declaring a maximum occupancy of 4 people in that category of room) and then place them in a tiny room with a queen bed and one person supposedly sleeping on the floor? It turned out that there were double rooms with two double beds still available so they just did not bother to check in advance. Pointless hassle and half an hour lost. We got the room though! Overall, I share the impression of some other reviewers that the only thing 4-star about this place is the lobby and the price. Decor is quite outdated; no tea/coffee making facilities in the room; minimum toiletries (i.e. no shaving kit) and especially a staggering 7.5 EUR charge for 30 minute internet surfing at the business centre. I find this offensive for a place charging +200 EUR per night (and it is not a little boutique hotel in the middle of nowhere).

The hotel is quite large and often busy and so lacks some of the more personal feel of other hotels, particularly the reception area which is often crowded and a bit chaotic. Having said that, this didn't affect my stay (just an observation). The hotel seems to be marketed as a 5* but I do feel this is over-rated and the hotel falls short of what I would expect for a 5* experience - in my view, it's a solid 4* hotel and delivers well against this. Both check-in and check-out were quick and efficient and all the staff we encountered seemed helpful and friendly. The room we had was very clean and comfortable and contained everything we expected. Overall, the room was perhaps a little smaller than I thought it would be but adequately-sized, with enough space so it didn't feel cramped. The bed was very comfortable and the bedding was nice. The bathroom had a bath with a shower in it. The shower was good, powerful and the bathroom clean. A number of toiletries were included and replaced each day but they looked a bit cheaper than I would expect from a chain such as the Marriott. Everything in the room and bathroom was clean and well looked after. The main reason I like this hotel is the location - it's easy to get from the Airport (I got the 197 bus which is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4 and stops right opposite the hotel, a 20-25 minute journey from the airport in light traffic). We walked everywhere we went from the hotel and didn't use the trams at all for this visit. It's 10 or so minutes walk from Dam Square and another 10 minutes to Centraal Station. The main museums, Vondelpark, De Pijp are all a short walk from the hotel as well.

Let me list the reasons why I did and would do this...followed by why I would not. Why stay? 1. Because you know what to expect... It is a Marriott in every sense of the word...you could be at the DFW Airport (well the views are different) or Philly, or LA or almost anywhere- the rooms, the workout facilities the lounge all scream \"American!\". I don't mean this pejoratively- simply take this for what it is. 2. Nice meeting areas and semi-private sitting areas around the restaurant and lounge for informal business dicussions. We used these and they are relaxing and informal. 3. Location- we walked to the the Concertgebow in 7 minutes- right in the middle of old Amstedam-and the views of old town from the upper floors are charming 4. Set up for business travels- painless- decent workout room (good but not great), executive lounge- internet charge is steep at 19 Euro a day and no WIFI (for Europe this is NOT understandable) so you are linked to a wire in your room. Hard to understand how Marriot could have missed this. Bottom line if you are not adventuresome, are on business and are an American need the feel of America in Holland then this is the place for you. Plus the location is tops Why Not? Well for starter this city is chock full of hotels/pensioners that are charming and Dutch in culture- there are at least five or six nice ones. Here are the ones I stuck my head in the door of and might be worth a chance (I think there are reviews of these in Trip Advisor): 1. Fusion Suites (pricey but beautiful- but no more expensive than the Marriott 2. Seven Bridges (less expensive than Marriott- very nice and location just as good!) 3.Hotel Esthera (excellent location, less expensive than Marriot- cutsey Dutch WallPaper) If I were not on business with colleagues and did not have meetings scheduled at the Marriot I would encourage travelers to try the hotels I listed above rather than the Marriot despite the bland niceness of the hotel and the location!", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Longwood, Florida", "Title": "\u201cMore elegant than I expected; perfect location\u201d", "Author": "travelerkt", "ReviewID": "UR58892283", "Content": "Ok, first the caveat: There is no local flavor to this hotel, nothing to tell you you're in Amsterdam; from the outside, it looks as though it was designed by a renegade Soviet architect. Beyond that, it's truly terrific. Chic touches (post-modern fireplace in the lobby; small, trendy bar with private, glass-enclosed lounges) surround a very good business hotel that would leave most leisure travelers thrilled. Situated at the foot of the Leindseplein, it is within walking distance of many of the major museums; and much of the best top- mid- and bottom-end shopping. And if you need to get anywhere else in town, three tram stops -- serving seven routes -- are across the street (you can buy up to a four-day pass.) Canal boat cruises leave from, virtually, the side door of the hotel. The rooms are standard for the better Marriotts, which is to say, quite good: clean with high-quality bedding, flat-screen TVs, good working space, sockets for virtually any plug, and nice -- though not luxurious -- baths. Service is uniformly friendly, and usually strong, especially from the front desk and concierge. The bar staff is encouraged to create their own drinks, adding a little personality to the proceedings. Food is merely ok, and definitely overpriced, but there are so many great restaurants in this town, it would be a crime to eat in the hotel.

Check-in, check-out and everything else was a breeze. The hotel staff went out of their way to suggest things to do and how to get to various spots. (such as suggesting the Stop and Go bus to the Anne Frank house.) We ended up walking instead, but we did see this bus and it would have been very convenient too (and only cost 1 euro). When we didn't have our luggage with us, we were able to walk all around the city. Amsterdam is very easy to get around. The room was very nice with nice furnishings and a very nice bathroom. The bathroom had a great large countertop with additional built in shelves. Also, it was refreshing to have a full shower curtain rather than a tiny glass wall that only covers a bit of the tub as so many European hotels choose to have. I am being generous in my review because I think that most times this hotel is probably great. When we were there at the beginning of October 2009, however, there was VERY LOUD renovations going on upstairs that woke us up each morning. There would have been no way to sleep through that. They started at exactly 8:30 each day. If we had been staying longer, I would have asked to change rooms. In my opinion, though, they should have never put us in that room to begin with. Very poor on management's part... Additionally, while you won't hear noise from Leidsplein, the windows are relatively thin - - so you will hear some noise from outside. It's nothing like the construction noise that was going on inside of the hotel, though!

From the outside it looks like a Soviet-era low-income housing block; drab, dreary, and uninviting. And the lobby doesn't do much to dispel that notion (nor do the check-in staff, for that matter). Like another reviewer, I took one look and was ready to bolt. And the common areas smell like an Amsterdam canal on a hot day, making us both quite apprehensive on the way to our room. But the room was a pleasant surprise. It was modern, clean, and reasonably stocked with the amenities you expect at a Marriott business hotel. Even mouthwash - which you won't get at The Ritz in London. We had a wide-screen LCD TV, iron, ironing board, hairdryer, and even slippers in the closet. A little Marriott secret another reviewer apparently didn't know is that if you don't have a robe in your room, all you have to do is call down and request one. We were on the 10th floor (room 1034) overlooking the neighborhood behind the hotel and we never heard any street noise at all. It was a very quiet, comfortable room. The only negative was the outrageous \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19.95 a day for internet access. The breakfast buffet in Quoy wasn't luxurious, but it was entirely adequate, if overpriced. We took the full buffet at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25. At that price you can stuff yourself to the gills with the pre-made offerings or get special order eggs of your choosing. There was also a nice assortment of very tasty breads, sweet rolls, fruits, cheeses, and so on. Even the coffee was decent. We didn't have dinner at Quoy, but I had a burger in the Characters Grill one afternoon and it was very good. As others have said, this hotel is well-located for seeing the Centrum, the Museum District, and the surrounding areas. While other reviewers have taken advantage of the public transport system, please know that if you like to walk you can see pretty much everything from the Jordaan to the Red Light District, to the Museum District on foot. It's a great walking city and the Marriott is in a good place from which to start. All in all, the hotel worked out very well for us.

When we said this to her, instead of being apologetic, she got very aggressive actually using the words 'I know how to do my job', it was only when we pointed out a second mistake on the bill ( we had been charged 55 euro for a lunch we never had) she actually started to take notice, and realised we had been overcharged 155 euro in total. At this point we were at reception about 45 minutes (there were other disputes going on at the same time too it seemed) and when she finally had settled our bill correctly, there was a muted apology but no offer of anything complimentary etc. If you expect anything in terms of standards of service, or hotels that put the customer first in your choice of accommodation, please avoid the Marriot in Amsterdam.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kaiserslautern, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location and excellent restaurant (Quoy)\u201d", "Author": "donnass", "ReviewID": "UR40535621", "Content": "Our stay at the Marriott in Amsterdam was of course, the usual, the best.

Our family of 4 including kids aged 10 and 12 booked a room with 2 double beds for 2 nights. The journey from the airport, travelling by train then tram was ok as we only had hand luggage and I'd been to Amsterdam before. Used a debit card for the train tickets (approx 13 euros for 4 of us) and had a little problem finding somewhere to buy the tram tickets, eventually finding a paper/sweet kiosk inside central station. The hotel is only 200m from the tram lines (1, 2 or 5) so easy to walk to. Check-in was pleasant and polite, clean lobby, lots of staff at the reception and concierge all friendly, everyone spoke English, lots of information available about tours, museums etc. We are very independent so just took a map and used that to wander around for 3 days. Room ok size, lovely beds with a very very comfortable mattress topper. Bathroom well equipped, nice toiletries (mirror steams up when showering!). TV free to view for about 30 basic channels, we didn't use anything additional. Hotel provided free tea and coffee between 7-10 am weekdays, until 11 am weekends in the lobby area, very nice too as we didn't take the option of having breakfast which was very pricey on our budget!! We ate at a brilliant waffle shop called Australia which is within a 5 minute walk of the hotel, just past H&M. We didn't eat at the restaurant at all as the choice of food locally was SUPERB!! There are Indian, Dutch, Indonesian, Argentine, Portuguese, Italian, French, Irish, English, Greek, Turkish.....well you name it! KIds loved the food and coming from London we are used to a wide range of food options, but this area beat London, hands down. Had very tasty unlimited spare ribs meal at the local Sports cafe (5 mins from hotel) whilst watching Man Utd V Porto. Bar was packed as there was also an Arsenal match on too. Atmosphere very well humored and friendly. Going back to the location, we walked with the kids everywhere and just took our time strolling along, through markets and museums, parks and canal streets, amazing to sit down too and people watch. Greta place to take kids who were so fascinated with all the types of traffic, though a real need to watch out and be careful as we couldn't tell who/what was coming in any direction!! Price wise I would say it is worth paying a tiny bit extra for this 5* hotel as we found it comparatively well priced given the facilities it offered as compared to some 2 and 3* properties. Also we have no real loyalty to any hotel chain but would definitely stay in a Marriott again if this is the level of service for the price. Only negative is that internally the hotel is soundproof BUT there is some street noise, from the tram bells, to passers by and car horns. I am a light sleeper, but other hotels do manage to design soundproof rooms in similar location types. I would say though that this should not put you off unless you are over noise sensitive like me!!

Once again, the staff was pleasant, efficient, and even friendly without being in the way.This time we stayed in a room with a view north over Leidseplein to City Center. The noise was definitely more than when we stayed in February, but since we were on the 10th floor, it didn't keep us awake. The noise from the bathroom fan was less in this room. The location of this hotel is excellent, but my personal opinion is that Leidseplein is a bit seedy. I prefer the Jordaan, but it is a short (lovely in the Spring) walk along the Prinzengracht from the Marriott, and I think the value proposition is better at the Marriott than at the Pulitzer. It is also steps away from the tram stop that will get you anywhere in metro Amsterdam, except Schipol. The parking lot is small, but we only used it for one night. I wish we had used it for two because a nearby lot charged us 58 Euros for 11 hours!!!! This time we ducked into the restaurant (\"Quoy\") right before they were closing and they didn't make us feel as if we were keeping them from leaving. The entrees were very good, as was the wine (bought on the waiter's recommendation), and since we were the only patrons, other members of the wait staff stopped by to chat. We had returned from a days drive to Friesland and the conversation - in English - took on the tone of talking to neighbors about your day. This is very typical of the interactions with the staff of the hotel. When I stayed in a Marriott in Paris, the staff made you feel as if you were taking all the energy they had. The prices and food at Quoy are on par with other restaurants we visited, such as DeLeutwe, De Rieger, Lucidous, and Sluizer. The best reason to stay here is the consistency of the experience. You can trust that the room will be clean and comfortable. The executive lounge deploys very good breakfasts, snacks, and hors d'oerves and the bar provides a comfortable place to unwind after a day sightseeing. The check in and check out experience are efficient and when I had a question about the bill, the young lady that answered remembered me from February. That counts in my book!

But the most important function of a hotel is to provide a good room, good bed and good location. The Marriott scored on all three. The rooms aren't particularly cutting edge, but they're extremely comfortable with nice armchairs and sofas. The ones we were allocated were huge with views over the canal and towards the city. As other reviewers have said, the beds and the proliferation of pillows are extremely welcome: they give a great night's kip. And despite the dreaded connecting doors, there was no noise from surrounding rooms: the sound-proofing seems to work. Then there's the convenience of having trams, canal boats and nice restaurants all within a short walk.

At first it seemed like the valets were just going to leave it to us to find our own spot; however, after much discussion we were told to remove everything valuable and they would park it at another location off-site (although, we got the impression they really didn't want to do this, like we were inconveniencing them). Went to check-in, and I was not offered anything as a platinum member - no room upgrade, no 500 points or check-in gift -- and this was no bargain booking, it was costing over $300 US / night and we were getting 2 rooms. The room was a disappointment - very small, on a smoking floor (ok, admittedly in Amsterdam probably all floors are smoking), over-looking an alley. When my sister checked -in she had reserved 2 cribs but was told the cribs would not fit in the room (yes it really was that small). When asked why she wasn't notified that at booking the clerk shrugged her shoulders and said she should have been. The only alternatives the clerk gave was to pay another 90euro/night (approx $120US) to upgrade the room (which mind you if I was given the upgrade that I am supposed to get we could have just swapped rooms) or downsize to one crib. My sister already felt the hotel was too expensive, so at this point I said to the clerk \"Look, I'm a platinum member, if there is anything you can do to help us out I would really appreciate it\". The clerk responded by laughing and saying, \"Oh my gosh, that is just the cutetst thing I have ever heard. I'm sorry but that's really not how things work. There is nothing we can do. But, oh, that was just so cute.\" I was just flabbergasted and my sister knew I was really pissed so she agreed to the upgrade just to get me out of there. Right after my sister and family got settled they found that their door lock broke and the maintenance man wouldn't be available until the next day. They were offered a different room, but the cribs were already setup and stuff unpacked (and the room offered was going to be smaller) so they declined. Everytime they left their room they had to go down to the front desk and find the bell hop to then take them up to their room and use the manual key (instead of key card) to let them in. With 2 kids this is quite a pain especially when you have to wait for the bell hop to finish with his previous customers.

Fairly small, but adequate and comfortable. Access to the exec lounge tho- which was fairly good- excellent service, free drinks and food during cocktail period and soft drinks/coffee during the day. There is a gym, bar and restaurant also on the ground floor - which felt quite local and cozy- and not like the usual marriott formal types. TV- standard TV, no idea what other people mean re problems as fairly easy to use- and even had BBC1 and BBC2 - so great for catching the end of The Apprentice. The location is good- easy walking distance to all main locations- the rijksmuseum (most of it closed to 2013 due to renovation so a big disappointment) and van gogh museums (latter is brilliant) are 5 mins away. 10 mins to the first shopping street.. and 2 minutes to the first canal... you can walk everywhere- a major plus as taxis are extortionate. 2 days and you can see pretty much everything in Amsterdam- unless you linger in the cafes and bars but as it was raining and cold- we did not linger... just did stores, museums and caught up with old friends... 20 mins to the airport (tip- get the local airport shuttle bus which picks up and drops off at all hotels for 16 euros- taxis will set you back 40 euros). It is a red brick building- nothing special. The room decor is also red. Perhaps not as good as some of the Marriotts of the same grade and price- and surprizing it is classified in one of the higher groups? One side of the hotel (not my side) has a reasonable view to a secondary canal and nice buildings-but I looked out on to offices and a bike park so not too exciting. My stay was fine, nothing special tho and a bit disappointing re views and not being on a canal to give a bit more local atmosphere. If I went back again soon- I might look for an older more unusual hotel on a canal. If someone is looking for a standard business hotel- I would recommend it. If looking for a more unusual hotel and a unique experience- probably I would not recommend it.

So, the hotel itself: yes, good service, decent room, large, comfortable bed (not bad pillows!), relaxing chair to sit in and good if small bathroom with (a pretty good) mixer shower, although the bathroom did lack a heated towel rack. And good location near museums, restaurants and trams. You can walk (quickly) in to Dam square in around half an hour. Characters bar and grill was good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice food for what it offered, warm and good for people-watching outside! The one disappointing thing was the lobby which (unlike other Marriots I have been in) was small and you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t relax in it with a coffee if you wanted to. However, we went between Christmas and New Year and this is why the hotel let itself down badly: firstly, the room was almost constantly only-just-warm-enough, and sometimes cold. Yes, Amsterdam was going through a cold patch (as in just below zero at night) but I would expect a five star hotel to be planned to manage that and cope with it. Instead, the built-in room heating, even when constantly set to 28 degrees, blew out just-about-warm air (although not until after several hours after we initially arrived) and on its own would not have made the room warm enough. When we mentioned this to the Marriot, I was told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the hotel is running out of heaters\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so clearly it was not just our room. That said, they did bring us an electric heater within 5 minutes and it did help. Another reason I think the room was cold was because it had a nice big window but without double-glazing. Therefore, not only did that mean a lack of warmth but it also provided very poor sound-proofing. We were on the seventh floor but at night we could hear every shout and car door slam in the street below. Yes, the hotel is on a main road but our room faced a side street and at night it was quite noisy on several nights. I do realise that one could argue that we should expect a degree of cold at this time of year, and a degree of noise as it is party season, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine if you want to accept that. But one of the reasons we booked a five star hotel was to get a better hotel which should negate those issues. We have stayed in other Marriots before in other cities and at this time of year and they have been fine, but unfortunately this did put us off the chain if we were considering doing another trip next year at this time. Finally, for food, we recommend Het Molenpad at Prinsengracht 653.

This hotel is one of the very best we have stayed in. We stayed at the Marriot Amsterdam in Dec and booked via the website. I was a bit anxious about booking a standard room as we were traveling with a child and infant. The rate was 189euros with breeakfast which was very good value by European standards. The hotel is well located in the fashion/night district of amsterdam and will take you all of 3 minutes to walk to the center of Liedseplein. The best way to get to the hotel from Schipol is to take the 370 bus from in front of the airport ($3.60euros). This bus stops in front of the American hotel just a stone's throw from the Marriot. Main downside is that the bus comes half hourly on weekdays and only hourly on weekends. Cabs will set you back 35-40euros and the journey takes just as long in peak hour. Another alternative is to catch the train from Schipol into the centraal station and then take the number 5 tram to the hotel (stops also in front of the American hotel). Looks can deceive as the hotel doesnt look impressive from the outside (unlike the American Hotel - which I stayed in October). The service at the reception was very good, friendly and efficient. We found the concierge service to be consistently helpful and friendly. The room we had (252) was amongst the most spacious standard room we have ever had in Europe. Two double sized beds in 1 room with ample space on either side and in between was pretty impressive - much larger than the standard in the American hotel. The bedding was very comfortable and clean. The bathroom was clean and functional with a lot of vanity space around the sink. The shower hose was leaking but was fixed promptly after we filled in a repair slip (all hotels should have one of these) and left it on the door. Internet is not free (8 euros/hr). If tv is important, you'll get a flatscreen tv with a good selection of english channels on cable. Breakfast was adequate with a reasonable selection of continental and American but if you want a classier selection with a lot more ambience, head to the American hotel for this. Overall, a very spacious, clean, functional and friendly hotel in a good location without the bells and whistles.

Our three-night stay in Amsterdam was during the first week of August, 2008 The Amsterdam Marriott has an excellent location. As others have said, it is steps away from the tram stop at Leidseplein, one of the central areas of Amsterdam. It is literally two blocks from major attractions such as Vondel Park, Rijks Museum, the Van Gogh Museum and Hard Rock Cafe. The Leidseplein area will provide you with everything you need including outdoor cafes and restaurants, entertainment, shops and stores. From Centraal Station, it is extremely easy to find. Simply, get on the 1,2 or 5 tram and it is about a 10 min ride. If you will be utilizing public transportation for several days, consider buying a Strippen Card from a tobacco shop for 6,90 euros. It will provide you approximately 7 trips on trams or busses. Ordinarily, one ride will cost around 1,30 euro each, so the Strippen Card is a very cost effective way to get around the city. If you have trouble navigating the public transportation or anything in Amsterdam, about 95% of Dutch people speak on average four languages, so you shouldn't have any trouble getting around, Regarding the hotel, I must say first, I am an Elite member of the Marriott Rewards program, and for the past three years have averaged over 100 nights per year at Marriotts. Nothing to be proud of, it simply means I have to travel quite a bit fout of town for my job. However, I remain loyal to the Marriott properties when I travel and have come to expect a certain level of predictibility from the hotel chain. We also utilized award points for these overnight stays, which should not - and did not influence the level of service we received at the Amsterdam Marriott. Check in was smooth and easy, and we were welcomed in the usual way. When we arrived to our room, we found it spacious by European standards, with average sized bathroom and normal ammenities. Yes, the beds are extremely comfortable after a long day of walking and touring. However, I found that the cleanliness of the room was definitely not up to Marriotts standards as the first thing we noticed was residue on the toilet from the previous guest(s). From days on, our room was not cleaned to anyones level of satisfaction. Used glassware was not removed. Glasses were not replaced from our minibar, even a complimentary bathrobe was not refolded and left over the back of a chair. For a full service Marriott, I have never stayed in one that did not provide a complementary telephone call from Guest Services to see if everything was in order, or the lack of turn-down service in the evening. As a Marriott Elite Member, I am offered, and appreciate the complimentary access to the Executive Lounge. While it is an advantage to utilize the breakfast services and evening snacks, we found the lounge had very poor management as there were many underage youngsters utilizing the services sometimes up to midnight - long after the lounge service was closed - to utilize the free internet terminals. While the kids were supposed to be under the guidance of their parents at all times, many parents simply gave them the access cards and left them unsupervised. On several occasions, during normal hours, we wanted to look up tourist activities for the day and had to wait in line for children to complete their activities on Facebook or other internet sites. In short, we found the Executive Lounge very poorly managed. To conclude, you will find the location of this Marriott very convenient. The ammenities are what you should come to expect from the Marriott brand of hotels. However, we found the level of cleanliness from the housekeeping staff, Executive Lounge management and general level of feeling \"welcomed\" at this Marriott was sorely lacking. With a modification in the General Management of this Marriott property and their better customer service training, I feel certain your stay will be more \"special\" than ours.", "Date": "August 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkhamsted, Herts", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "zryder", "ReviewID": "UR18824840", "Content": "To be honest, we only booked the Marriott because of a special deal on Expedia but were really pleased.

We had never been to Amsterdam but have been to The Netherlands several times. We like the places and people so far but Amsterdam was our least favorite and the Marriot had something to do with that. It was hard to get to from the central train station. We walked for at least 45 minuted before we finally got to the hotel. We arrived at the hotel at 11 am and our room wasn't ready yet. No problem for us because we wanted to explore the city. They offered to hold our luggage so we could go out and about. Everything okay so far. When we returned at 3 PM our room wasn't ready still. Eager to freshen-up we inquired how long it was going to take. 15 minutes the staff said so we opted to wait in the reception area. We ended-up standing around for at least 40 minutes because all the local businessmen seem to use the lounge to keep meetings. No one of the staff offered any drinks or otherwise. When the room was finally ready (after asking at least 6 times) we got a key and that was it. We went up to the room and didn't find our luggage there. We called down to the reception and they appologised for not returning it to us. Then they told us to come down to indentify it but never offered us help to get it to our room! How rude! They didn't even have a cart to use. The room was nice and the hotel itself was great, but the people ruin it. It might be an Amsterdam thing because everyone seemed to be rude. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a New Yorker so I'm used to something. But this was out of the ordinary. The upside is the location of the hotel and the breakfast which is nice.

On balance, I was pleased with the hotel and agree with the mostly positive reviews other travelers have offered here. The location is pretty good, especially for the Rijksmuseum (a 5 minute walk) and the Van Gogh museum (a 10 minute walk). The Anne Frank house is about 15 minutes away, and the Red Light District is a little farther, probably around 25 minutes or so. The hotel offers free coffee in the lobby in the morning, which is kind of a nice touch before heading out to start your day. I would add a few additional observations: First, if you're looking for places to eat, the Leidesplein is literally a three minute walk out of the hotel, and it's a place replete with cafes and outdoor seating sure to make you feel like you are having an authentic Amsterdam experience. If you're looking for a quiet table at a canalside cafe, I would also recommend the Jordaan neighborhood. It's in the direction of the Anne Frank house, about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. It's much less crowded than the Leidesplen, and there are a fair number of outdoor table that directly overlook a canal, which is probably the most visible characteristic of Amsterdam. Getting from Central Station to the hotel can be done fairly cheaply on the tram, but if you've got luggage that's at all bulky, I might suggest spending the 20 Euros for a cab.", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLoved!

But this hotel was extraordinary and is therefore my first 'five star' rating. Easy stuff to start: The rooms are very large by European standards. I expected a room too small to leave my suitcase open in, and was completely (but happily) mistaken. Very large, comfortable and well appointed rooms appear to be the norm based on my room and those of my colleagues (I saw two others that were the same as mine). Internet connection was speedy, so I think the issues previous reviewers had must have been resolved by the time I visited. It's pricey, but no more so than any other hotel in Europe. In fact cheaper than some. The breakfast buffet is very good with plentiful quantities and options, but I'd suggest going out for lunch and dinner as the hotel's excellent location makes it easy to explore. Now's where I start raving. If service isn't the thing that makes or breaks a stay for you, just skip the rest of this review. Every single staff member at this hotel truly embodies the \"spirit to serve\" that the Marriott markets itself on. I've stayed at countless Marriotts and never thought much of it - everyone was OK and the rooms were clean. Other than the Book of Mormon in the bedside table, I can't think of anything that's distinguished Marriott from any other hotel for me in the past. But the people at this hotel put their counterparts - and virtually every other hotel's staff I've ever stayed at - to complete shame. The very busy front desk staff remembered me every time I had cause to pop down (and it's not like I'm particularly distinctive in any way). In fact when I rang on my last day to query something on the bill, the man who answered was the one who'd checked us in several days before and he had remembered both me and the special billing request I'd made. I just about fell over. The most amazing part for me was the concierges, who must attend to literally hundreds of guests each day. Every time we dealt with them I left with great information and a smile on my face. One quick example: Silly me had lost my luggage tags somewhere between my meeting and the hotel and was rushing to pick up my luggage and catch a cab back to the airport. I had to complete a form because I'd lost the tags (which they made quick and painless, even joining me - respectfully - in my own joke about my stupidity to lose my tags), Before I'd even finished signing the form, the second concierge had all of my bags sitting next to me. I hadn't described them or told him anything at all about them - he's just got an extraordinary memory and is very good at his job. Every exchange I had with the hotel staff, even when I was rushing like a mad fool, was not only courteous but also friendly in the very direct Dutch way of being friendly but not obsequious. It was truly a landmark of the stay. And it's the feature that will make me pay extra to stay at the Marriott even when I travel to Amsterdam for leisure. I really have seen evidence of the \"spirit to serve\", rather than reading the beautiful book they put on your nightstand (of the same title) and wondering why I never see those people when I stay at Marriotts around the world. The answer is that they all work in Amsterdam.", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel with Updated Rooms!\u201d", "Author": "ATLyuppie", "ReviewID": "UR14352542", "Content": "After spending 7 days in Italy where we stayed at somewhat average hotels, arriving at the Marriott in Amsterdam felt incredible.

We used the Connexxion airport shuttle that someone else referenced in another review. They were very helpful and efficient. Upon arrival, we were immediately asked if we wanted to upgrade to the club level. For 50 Euro per night I thought it was a little too expensive since you basically get continental breakfast and access to a computer. The room we received was very quiet and clean. We chose a courtyard view to stay away from the street. Rooms are small by US standards but ours was big enough to have one suitcase open and still walk around. Room service was spotty. Although they cleaned every day and changed the sheets when we asked, they left glasses unclean and mirrors not wiped down. We did dine at the Pizza hut restaurant. The food was much better than any US Pizza Hut I ever went to. However, the other room service wasn't very good. The food we received was far undercooked, even though we asked for well done. I had to ask to have it taken off the bill over the phone, as well as when I checked out. The location of this hotel is great. It's within easy walking distance of the museums, the Leidseplein, and a lot of shopping. And, the tram is super easy to catch across the street. My biggest complaint about this hotel is that you get nickel and dimed on everything. Internet is 20 Euro if you want to use it in your room. There's no free wifi and even the business center is expensive. The only inclusive is the free coffee in the lobby if you manage to make it down there before 10am. All in all, if I had the points, I'd stay here again. If I had to pay for it, I'd look elsewhere first. If you plan on booking, you should know that this is a very business centered hotel and you will be charged like a business person.

This was my first time to Amsterdam and the hotel is a perfect location. From the airport we took the train to the Centraal Station and a cab from the train station. The cab was 16 Euros and there were plenty of cabs waiting outside the station. Our room (#1043) was on the 10th floor. We had a great view of the canal in front of the hotel as well as the nearby Leidseplein. The room was quiet and we had no problems during our stay. Our fight (from NYC) got in at 8 am and we were at the hotel at 10 am. Our room was ready, but being a Marriott Rewards Gold Member, they had an upgrade for me if I wanted to a bigger room with a view. However, that wouldn't be ready for an hour. We had breakfast nearby and came back in an hour and our room was ready. The room was very nice - big bathroom, new-comfy Marriott bed, flat screen tv, mini-bar and a nice view with sliding screen door to open. The major plus factors at this hotel were the English speaking concierge - very very helpful as well as the actual concierge lounge itself (on floor #9). I had free access to this lounge being a Rewards Member, however if you have to pay extra for a room on that floor we found it had a very bountiful breakfast each day and numerous appetizers in the evening. Plus, they have free internet access there as well so we were able to find info online, etc. I cannot stress how the hotel location is very good here. Unless you want to be in the center of the Red Light district or The Dam area this locale is perfect - close enough to everything yet pretty quiet at the same time. It is a 5 minute walk to the two-big museums Van Gogh and the Rijksmuseum. The canal tours right across the street were great. 10 Euros/each and we had a complete canal circle- hour tour. The other historic sights: Anne Frank House, Beginhof, Rembrandt's House, etc were all short walks. We had dinner in the American Cafe in the American Hotel - which is just over the bridge across from the Marriott. Very nice dinner - a bit on the pricey side, but great dinner and atomosphere. Other tips we came across is get the audio guides at all the tour stops, museums, etc. they are highly worth it and add so much more information. Also, we went on a day trip to The Hague (Den Haag) - the capital city and visited the Mauritshuis Museum. This was my favorite museum in the Netherlands. It is a small museum, but each piece of art is stunning including the most-famous Vermeer, \"Girl with the Pearl Earring\" The audio tour said there are 36 known Vermeer paintings in the world and this museum has three of them on display (the Rijksmuseum has 4 Vermeers as well). The train ride to The Hague was very inexpensive and about 45 minutes each way. The Hague is a very small/compact city and easy to navigate.

The trip was relatively easy and stress-free even though we had to drag 4 pieces of luggage with us. Next time, I think I will use the airport shuttle for a few Euro more. When we got to the hotel around 10:30 am, the front desk was very nice and let us into the room immediately.

Expensive, but if you have more than 1 person & any type of luggage best way. About 35Euro + tip. 2) Connexion hotel shuttle (which I did this trip): 12.50E 1-way; 19.50E RT. You can book at Schipol & they take cc's. Have to call 2-hours prior for return shuttle (or night before). On the return, they tell you up front that the shuttle can be up to 15 minutes late so I booked the timeframe one before I really wanted to get to airport to compensate. The bellstaff has the pick-up schedule at the front desk & will call the shuttle service to arrange pick-up. 3) Last is take train from Schipol to Central Station & then backtrack on the 1,2 or 5 Tram to Leidesplain & then a 5-minute walk to hotel. I'm not into schlepping & this trip I always have lots of luggage, so that doesn't work for me but I know others have done it w/ no problem. CHECK-IN Arrived about 9am. Check-in went easy-peesy. Being Mariott Platinum member, they sent me up to the exec lounge to wait until room was ready. Bellman stored luggage. They're used to that, as they get a lot of morning arrivals. FYI for others. On the credit hold, in addition to the room charges, they put 75Euros (approx $110)/night additional hold on the c.c. EXECUTIVE LOUNGE The executive lounge is lovely. 2 rooms overlooking the Leidesplain. One room has couches, chairs, tables & 2 free internet terminals. The other has a couple of tables/chairs, & is the main section for meals. They have a flatscreen television in one room, and they carry USA Today, Wall Street Journal Europe, and the rest varies - London Times, International Herald Tribune, and an Amsterdam newspaper. Hours: Weekdays: 6am-Midnight Weekend: 6:30am-Midnight Breakfast is served in the lounge: Monday-Friday: 6am-10am Saturday-Sunday: 7am-10am Cocktail hours are: Daily: 5:30pm-9:30pm Hors d'oeuvres: 5:30pm-7:30pm Dessert: 7:30pm-9:30pm Wine & beer is free. Hard booze has a charge (form to fill out; honor bar). Wednesday night is the 'manager's reception', and from 6pm-7pm Quoy (the hotel's restaurant) sends up food (lamb, duck, sushi, gourmet type stuff). Brekkie in the morning has dif types of meat, cheeses, 6 dif types of fresh fruit, lots of juices, 8 types of cereal (boxed), hard-boiled eggs, yogurts, toast, pastries, croissants, etc. Cocktail hour munchies vary from Dutch items to seafood to couscous. Also veggie trays and at times cheese trays. Dessert is various desserts (chocolate ones, pastries, cakes, cookies, etc). During the day & until midnight, there's free soda, bottled water, tea & coffee. I LOVE the exec lounge staff here. They're great. Also thumbs up to the guest relations managers. ROOMS The rooms were recently renovated, and are quite nice. The beds are lovely; you sink into them. 6 pillows. 3 foam; 3 feather. Great duvet. The headboards have nightlights on both sides. Granite sink tops etc. Hairdryer provided, as well as make-up mirror. Usual bathroom amenities. Television gets several channels in multiple languages. CNN is 1 & I think Sky is 5. There's a channel called Veronica (channel 16) that has a lot of American television shows (NCIS, The Shield, Profiler, Seinfeld, etc). BBC is on channel 2 or 3. Closet has a lot of hangers, including skirt hangers, and also has a programmable safe that's large enough to hold a laptop. Also has ironing board/iron. The desk has all the outlets built in, and also include 110V US-style outlet too. Note to others. Do not plug your personal hairdryer into the 110V; blows the fuse. I didn't do it, but the electrician mentioned it to me when he repaired the fuse from when the previous occupant did. PHONE/INTERNET There is for-charge internet access in the rooms & wifi in the lobby. There are also 2 free i-net terminals in the exec lounge, with a limit of 20 minutes at a time. Charge for i-net in room is 19.95E, which includes tax. The sign on the box says noon-noon, but I confirmed w/ guest relations that it's 24-hours from when you log on. Phone charges: 1st 5minutes/each additional minute Local Call: .75E/.50E National: 1.00E/.75E Mobile: 2.75E/2.25E USA/Canada: 3.00E/2.50E Europe: 3.00E/2.50E Asia: 9.00E/8.50E Middle East/Gulf: 9.00E/8.50E South-America: 9.00E/8.50E Russia & Baltic: 9.00E/8.50E Africa: 9.00E/8.50E Special Numbers (0900): 3.50E/3.00E Internet Numbers*: .75E/.50E * starting w/ 0676/0677... Access Fee (0800)*: 2.00E * fixed charged after 60-seconds Please note that '1-800' numbers ARE NOT TOLL-FREE outside the U.S. and will be charged as international phone calls (3E per number). ROOM SERVICE Open 24 hours. Rates include tax+service, although there's a line for tip. If they don't deliver in 45 minutes, food is free. HEALTH CLUB Health club is open 24/7 w/ room key. Treadmills, weights, spa, etc. Nice. If you're more into outdoor stuff, Vondel Park is literally next to the Marriott & you can go running, walking or biking through there. RESTAURANT Quoy is the main restaurant. Have never eaten here, although I've heard good people say good things about it. I've heard the breakfast is pricey so you'd probably want to go elsewhere for brekkie. There's also a Characters bar in the hotel, which is a basic pub bar. Think it has a pool table. And there's a Pizza Hut on site (w/ salad bar). You can charge to room service. CONCIERGE/BELLMAN They're quite helpful. Like other staff, been here quite a long time. They can sell tickets to some (not all) of the museums. I've heard it's good to do that, as it avoids the lines at the museums. Also good for restaurant recommendations etc. LOBBY/GIFTSHOP/BUSINESS CENTER/HOTEL DOCTOR This is the miscellaneous category. The lobby is ok. Not super large or exotic, but servicable. Same as the exterior of the hotel. There is a gift shop w/ most of the usual stuff, plus AMS type gift items which I've purchased in the past. There is a biz center w/ the usual stuff. Boarding pass printing is free, btw. Charge for other stuff. Each elevator foyer has a plate w/ apples for guests. Elevators require a room key to operate. Had a bit of a medical problem during my stay. Nothing urgent, but needed antibiotics which requires a prescription. US doctor can't prescribe over here, so needed to use local doc. Hotel had on-call doc call me in my room, and then I went over to doc's office ('bout 10 minutes away). Because I went there for quick test, rate was 20E cash vs 100E if doc came to hotel room. Got prescription & had it filled at pharmacy around the corner hotel recommended (12.11E for 'script). STAFF I can't speak highly enough of the guest relations managers & the executive lounge staff, not to mention the GM of the hotel!!! They're all excellent & truly kept track of things/were so service friendly, I rank them as some of the tops in the Marriott chain. LOCATION I like the location of the Marriott. It overlooks the Leidesplain, and is only a few minutes away from Museumplein & a lot of other attractions. Doesn't really take long to get to any attractions. Nice central location. Also, there's a canal close to it so people can sign up for canal tours there, etc.", "Date": "September 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Attard", "Title": "\u201cMouse in hotel restaurant\u201d", "Author": "WalterWalter", "ReviewID": "UR8723735", "Content": "My wife and me had booked this hotel for our twentieth wedding anniverasry.

We talked to the hotel manager and advised her that we will not be eating any food from this hotel, not even the breakfast which was pre-paid.

I recommend crossing the canal to have champagne breakfast at the famous Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Americain. We stayed at this hotel for three days. We were given a room on the 10th floor, and it was well equipped and had a very comfortable king bed. The bathroom was quite small, and the toiletries were limited to basics (but they smelled great - lemongrass, I believe). The room could have been cleaned better; - there were greasy fingerprints on the inside of the window and the carpet was very thick and apparently difficult to vacuum properly. We would, however, have been quite pleased with the room had it not been for the noise. There was a machine-like sound that made it impossible to fall asleep (it felt like being aboard a ferry). After a night without any sleep, we complained, and were told that they would look into it. We got back to our room to find that they had placed a piece of cardboard over the bathroom fan (which is impossible to switch off at night). However, the next night proved that the bathroom fan had not been the culprit. The noise was still there, and it was not coming from the bathroom, but from somewhere outside the room. After another night without any sleep, we asked for a new room. When we returned to the hotel that night, they had moved our suitcases to the new room. It was on the 6th floor, close by the elevator, facing the street, and it was smaller and not as well appointed as the room we had been in. Hint to the hotel: When someone complaines and shows great patience by letting you try to resolve the situation first, and you're not able to, which results in guests that haven't slept properly for two nights, and you have to move them, at least have the decency to give them a room of equal or better standard. The new room had a harder, less comfortable bed, only one nightstand (which translates to one nightstand lamp without blue light; not good news if you like to read), fewer toiletries (no conditioner for instance), no bathrobe, and a more limited minibar selection. Housekeeping seemed to have the same problem vacuuming the carpet in this room, and the bathroom fan could not be switched off here either. Fortunately, though, there wasn't the same machine-like sound to keep us awake at night. But who needs machine-like sounds to keep you awake at night when the room isn't soundproofed? We heard every word of the conversations in the rooms next to us, we heard the people in the hallway, not to mention the traffic outside, and we woke up every time an ambulance passed by. When cheking out, the receptionist asked us if we had any suggestions for them on how they could improve, and I said that they ought to work on the noise problem. She answered me back saying \"yes, well, it's a busy city\". Second hint to the hotel: I know very well that Amsterdam is a busy city, and apparently so do you. That is the reason why you should install proper soundproofing. People expect that from a 5 star hotel. I should also mention that there is internet access in the rooms, but it's very expensive (I think it was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 per day). I always find it tacky when five star hotels charge extra for internet access, I really think it should be free. If you're going to stay at this hotel, I suggest asking for one of their larger rooms not facing the street, and keep your fingers crossed that you don't wind up in the room with the machine-like noise.", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cJust Back from Amsterdam Marriott\u201d", "Author": "njtravelpros", "ReviewID": "UR8681973", "Content": "My husband and I have just returned from our 8 night stay at the Marriott Hotel in Amsterdam. Our flight from the USA arrrived into AMS at 6:30AM and after quickly going through customs and avoiding baggage claim since we do carry-on whenever possible, we headed downstairs and took the train to Central Station and then the #2 tram which lets you off a short walk from the hotel. (You can take the 1, 2 or 5 tram to the hotel from the Central Station) All in all an effortless trip and very inexpensive (approximately $8 per person). Upon our arrival at the hotel we were told our room was not ready, which we had expected since it was 8:00 in the morning. We were directed to the 9th floor Executive Lounge since my husband is a Platinum Marriott member. What a great perk to have use of this lounge..........a great breakfast every morning, afternoon snacks and cocktails and evening coffee, tea and deserts. Also, located in the lounge are 2 computers with high speed internet connections available for use at no charge (in room internet costs 20 Euro per day). The hotel is very well run. The staff is very polite and everyone that we encountered spoke excellent English. The newly renovated rooms are excellent, large enough, and the bathrooms well appointed and very modern with brand new fixtures. The location of the hotel is excellent due to the close proximity and an easy walk to the major museums, abundant shopping areas and varied restaurant choices. We had a rental car for 3 days and utilized the hotel parking, no problem, although at 30 Euros per day a bit expensive. As far as the hotel, I can say not a negative word about the facility or the staff. As previous reviews have mentioned, the outside appearance of the hotel might lead one to have less than great expectations. But once inside everything is terrific!

We had upgraded to the executive lounge so could go and fetch whatever we wanted but it would be nice to not have to leave the room early in the morning for a tea or coffee. only a minor thing though. the executive lounge may not be amazing value for what you get in terms of food, but simply having a pleasant place to relax, get a drink and a cookie, maybe surf the internet and print off information for your next days activities was really useful and welcome. the breakfast buffet itself is fairly standard continental fayre, and i rather enjoyed the relaxed informal atmosphere in the room at breakfast time, people often share tables and it all seems a little friendlier than sitting just in rigid ones or twos. the staff were friendly and courteous, even the lady i almost floored swinging my bag back onto my shoulder in the corridor as we arrived! the concierge service was helpful in my request for sporting event tickets, though i did get 2 different answers from the 2 guys i asked over 2 days, i still got what i needed. the hotel doesnt feel oppresively posh; it has some pretty relaxed public areas, the bar actually looks like a bar and there's a place to grab a Kip sate and frites or a pizza as well as a more formal restaurant. (the pizzas looked very small though) while we were in reception we heard a bride from the UK complain that her room was filthy and demanding her money back but that wasnt our experience. i guess mistakes happen; or maybe some people just over react. after we left we spent a week in a cottage in rural holland with the family. but both of us wished we were heading back to the marriot for a few more nights before we returned home.", "Date": "July 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in top location\u201d", "Author": "sketchym8", "ReviewID": "UR7873271", "Content": "managed to get this hotel at a great price but regardless it is a really nice hotel with all the amenities you would expect from a 4* hotel. bit twin room, good room service. breakfast is exp I think but there was no chance I was going to be up by 11am which is when breakfast finishes anyway.

If you read through the past reviews, the consensus is that the hotel, while in a great location near the Museums and Vondelpark, left a little to be desired. Recently the hotel went through some rather major renovations and this probably contributed greatly to the bargain price. Anyway, I cannot say enough about the quality of the newly renovated room I stayed in. You can get a good idea of the value management placed on imparting a luxurious impression to the visitor by the quality of the improvements. Lets start with a 42 inch high definition flat screen television. How is that for luxury. In the bathroom we have black granite countertops, Grohe faucets, Villeroy and Bosch sink, and real porcelain tub. Then we move on to what looks to be solid cherry wood accents throughout. In the bedroom we have a nice Marriott take on Sheratons Heavenly bed. Very cushy, plenty of pillows, etc.... The desktop is solid black granite, with a nice high end leather or leather look chair. The rug was a beautiful red pattern somewhat akin to a Belgian rug. You get the picture. This is serious luxury we are talking here. The room itself, and the outside matching renovated hallway look 5 star all the way. The other parts of the hotel. Well, they were not bad. The outside of the hotel is not renovated and appears seriously dated. Inside the lobby, the renovations are not as obvious. Although the area does look new, it does not stand out. The location of the hotel is quite ideal. Walking out the door straight ahead about two blocks you head straight into the center of one of the cities hottest Restaurant sections (Leidesplein). and a Tram stop for convenient transport to the Central Station area. You can of course walk to Central station from the Marriott, but it is quite a nice hike. I would say 40 minutes or so. Also a short walk accross the street are a number of Canal tours. To the right one block or so is one of the cities largest parks (Vondelpark), another block or so down is the Rijksmuseum where you can see many of Rembrandts finest works. The Van Gogh museum is also in this area. I tried the Quo restaurant for the breakfast buffet at $25 Euros and was underwhelmed at the quality of the offerings at that price. A few days later, for comparison, I tried the breakfast buffet at the American Hotel and formed a similar impression. This time it was only $21 Euros. Anyway, you get the picture.

There is a Grill restaurant and a Pizza Hut in the Hotel, but we only had coffee there. The staff is helpful and friendly, there is even a small souvenir shop in the Lobby for those not wanting to look around for souvenirs. Our personal Hotel recommendations: Ask for two beds since those rooms are bigger the ones with one double bed, if you like a nice view, ask for front side but high floor (but be aware, that street can be heard). Avoid breakfast if its not included in the rate and avoid internet, look for internet cafes around, there are plenty !! Recommendations for Amsterdam: You have to make a Canal tour, there is a company right across the square, if you leave the hotel to your right, opposite the Casino. Go to see the red light district, but take care, no photos of the girls in the windows. There are guys around to avoid this. Just take good shoes and walk along the little canals early morning, such charming views. The hotel is renting bikes for 10 Euro per day, reserve the day before because they only have a limited number. Drive around early moning and go to Vodel Park next to the hotel, very peaceful dont worry the traffic, they take care on bikers, since biking is very common in Holland.

Also, we weren't asked if we wanted smoking or not at brekky, and having settled down to breakfast the man at the next table lit up and puffed all over us and our food. We moved, as did the people next to us. The non smoking area is a windowless room, while the smoking area is nice and bright at the front - and has all the food on display (with smokers all around it) don't see the logic there. I know that sounds picky, and probably 5 years ago we would have sat on and put up with it, but UK and Ireland seem to be the only bits of Europe where it is accepted that smoking really does kill you and those around you - in Ireland and Scotland it is illegal to smoke in a public bar or restarant and it will be in UK this year.

The staff was very friendly and had smiles on their faces, they were very helpful in giving us any info about the area. We were going to take a taxi back to the airport when the desk clerk told us the Bus was more dependable and cost only 20% of what a taxi would cost. I did hear a few tales about the taxi drivers that were not so good. You can take the #370 to the airport, takes about 30-35 minutes runs every 34 minutes or once per hour, the Marriott has bus schedules. Some tips: if arriving for the first time and at Centraal Station they will tell you to watch out for pick pockets, like many places. Make sure when you arrive you know how you are getting to Leidseplein where the Marriott is. This is a 15-20 minute walk and you do not want to do this with a lot of luggage. I would say figure out how you are getting to your hotel and back to the airport before you arrive and get a map to be more familiar with Amsterdam and the long names used by the Dutch. Overall the Dutch are some of the most friendly people I have ever met, but still you want to not be lost or look like an easy target when you arrive. There probably will be a large crowd in the Centraal Station area most of the time, not some wwhere you want to be walking around with big suitcases. The hotel is in a great area for anything you are looking for, 100's of places to eat, shop and have fun. I would stay here again, its on the higher priced end in A-Dam , but still a good value if you are willing to pay $300 or a little more a night.

Decent amenities in bathroom. Large safe. Ice-machine down the corridor, which suited our party weekend (Queensday) nicely.

When I first saw the building for the Marriott I got a little worried, b/c it doesn't look that great from the outstide, but as soon as we stepped inside I knew it would be great! Our room was on the 6th floor, with a balcony and very clean. The staff was extremely helpful and courteous, we checked in with zero problems and everyone was more than willing to help us with directions or suggestions for places to go to. The hotel was very easy to get to, it could not have been any easier, and you can basically walk everywhere from the hotel. We did use the Tram, but mainly walked all over the city without a problem. We purchased most of our tickets to the museums from the concierge which turned out to be great, b/c we did not have to wait in any lines!! we paid $122/night on priceline.

We had fun watching the trams, pedestrians and bikers and the more distant view of Liedersplein with its cafes and nighttime performers. The room was totally soundproofed so there was no noice despite the hubub outside. When I have bid on priceline before and contacted the hotel to ask for a room with a non smoking room with two beds, I have invariably been told that my request would be noted but that there was no guarantee with priceline. In this instance, the hotel promptly emailed me that they would be happy to meet my request. Front desk and concierge staff were very friendly and helpful. Two canalboats departed from across the street, there is a pancake house also in the square across the street, a tourist information office, shopping, cafes, bakeries etc. one block away.", "Date": "June 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anniston, AL", "Title": "\u201cFor $100/night on Priceline, man what a deal...\u201d", "Author": "charlesturner", "ReviewID": "UR3447926", "Content": "Our low nightly rate probably colored our view of this place, but at $100 a night I think its a great value. First, the location: the Marriot is between the Leidesplein and Vondelpark, which is really a great area. The Liedesplein is the party center of Amsterdam, and is chock full of restaurants, bars, coffeeshops and other people partying. Vondelpark/Museumplein, as the name implies, contains a nice park and some world class museums. Second, the property is really deluxe. It has uniformed doormen, bellman and concierge. There are two eateries, a bar, a gift shop and a gratis morning coffee concession in the lobby. There is a free laundry on the second floor. Okay, so from the outside it does resemble the Politburo Marriot - but I didn't care how it looked on the outside. Third, the rooms are \"nice for Europe.\" That is, our room had a safe, ironing board, iron, unbelievably comfortable king sized bed and a small television. As is mentioned in other reviews, the heating and cooling leaves something to be desired, but by opening and closing the window, we were able to stay comfortable. The bath is large and the shower is great. The concierge staff was extremely helpful. This old dude gave me directions to the Dampkring Coffee Shop without batting an eye. Hell he plotted it out on a map. Another of the concierge staff gave us the heads up on beating the line at the Van Gogh Museum by selling us our tickets (at the same price as the museum). We strolled past the other art fans and were checking out the Potato Eaters in no time at at all. Getting there was easy from Schiphol Airport. We hopped a $5 train from the airport to Centraal Station. We then hopped on a tram (lines 1, 2 or 5) and were at the Marriot ten minutes later. When you get on the tram, tell the conducter that you need to get off at the Marriot and he or she will tell you when to get off over the PA. Transportation around Amsterdam is easy from the Marriot. Three different tram lines run from Central Station by the hotel all day. We explored the whole city by jumping on and off trams. We found the Dutch to be the coolest people on earth. They speak English better than I do, they are very friendly and are perhaps the best looking people on the face of the earth. We cannot wait to go back. If I had to pay more than $100, I would be far less enthusiastic. But for the price we paid, it was the best deal in town.", "Date": "May 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plantation", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "SWAMPRAT", "ReviewID": "UR3436058", "Content": "You can't beat the location of the Amsterdam Marriott. There are bars, restaurants and coffee shops everywhere within walking distance. It's also within walking distance to the main museums (Van Gogh, Riks Museum, etc.). The best restaurant we ate at was Puri Mas (ristafjel - typical Indonesian rice table meal). The food was excellent, plentiful and the staff were friendly and accommodating. The only problem we had was with the A/C in our room. If you are concerned about being able to control the climate in your room, make sure you ask if the A/C or heating is individually controlled when you make the reservation. I found out that in these older hotels in Europe, even if there is a thermostat in your room, that doesn't mean that you can really control the temperature. It's pretty much on winter (heating) or summer (cooling) overall, and controlled from a central location. Fortunately, we were able to keep our room cool by opening the window. Other than that, the rooms were clean, beds were comfortable (double beds instead of twins is a plus) and the location is excellent.
