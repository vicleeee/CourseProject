Overall, I was very pleased with the hotel and had a most pleasant stay. The room was nicely painted: maybe not just newly done, but it still had quite a fresh appearance, in nice pastel colours. The bathroom was spotless and featured the usual toiletries, plus shoe-cleaning cloths. A hairdryer was available and I loved the exfoliating soap. The bed was super-clean and very comfortable. The room was on a high floor, with a pleasant view of the avenue below: yes, you could hear some street noise, and I was sometimes aware of the lift outside the room, but nothing was ever loud enough to bother me. The front desk staff were excellent: all very efficient and professional. The gentlemen on the late and early shifts were very pleasant and clearly made the effort to remember the guests' room numbers when handing back the key cards: an important part of good customer service. Other plus points: the hotel was easily accessible by public transport, with the Place d'Italie metro station just a minute's walk away. Although not right in the centre of Paris, there's a choice of three metro lines from the station, with connections to all the major attractions. The TV didn't pick up the full range of channels, but you don't go to Paris to stay in and watch TV, so this didn't worry me. Maybe the desk in the room had seen better days, and there was one occasion when housekeeping omitted to leave any hand towels....but in the overall scheme of things these were very minor niggles and I mention them only to keep the review balanced. The area is very vibrant and features a varied selection of restaurants, ranging from various Asian cuisines through to the ubiquitous McDonalds, so there really is something for everyone. It's a neighbourhood that feels safe, although you should always exercise all the usual commonsense precautions, as you would anywhere else.

The rooms could be better lit and are certainly not large but the bathrooms and linen are spotlessly clean, the towels fluffy and the maid service good. The breakfast is good value (compared to other hotels) but I confess we didn't try it, preferring to go to a local cafe. The a/c worked fine. The location (Place d' Italie) whilst not right in the middle (30min walk to Notre Dame) is well served by Metro (Lines 6 & 9). The front desk staff were really helpful, especially Stephen, who was on the late shift while we were there. His English was excellent and he did all he could to make our stay comfotrable.

These restaurants have good food and very good prices. Negative about this hotel: 1. They left dirty towels in the bathroom for you. The towels were old and got blood stains on them. 2. The receptionists people are mean and gave me split 2 beds when I reserved 2 single beds and specific put a request for 2 single beds.

Great location - transport hub, nice restaurants and bars in the Butte aux Cailles. Clean and refurbished in 2009. Noise: our room was facing a noisy street. The hotel has put in some good double glazed windows, but you can still hear traffic and sirens in the night. We could hear the lift all night (the engine and the \"going down\" recorded voice, over and over again). While in the corridor we heard somebody opening a can in their room, as if they were sitting next to us! Rooms can get stuffy and hot even on cold days, but the air conditioning works well. The rooms are very small and basic, no tea/coffee-making facilities. As in many Paris buildings, lift very small. In theory it fits max 4 people, but realistically more like 2 or 3. In an emergency I wouldn't like to have to tackle the steep, narrow, dizzying staircase that really, really, really needs a bannister, but there is no other way out. Reception area is smart, but despite the refurbishment, the rooms don't look particularly new. The bathroom corners are probably the weak point, but it is generally a very clean hotel. Breakfast was disappointing: seemed like cheap fare with the standard continental variety. The white toast on offer is offensive when you think of the wonderful bread you can get anywhere in France! Poor value for money even for Paris, at 170\u00e2\u201a\u00ac (+12\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for breakfast) if you are desparate enough to pay the official price. We paid over 120\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, and it was three stars at a stretch. Mind you, I've stayed at a 2* in France that was abismal, and another that was excellent, so until the new 2009 star classification is applied (by 21 July 2012), the star rating is not entirely reliable.

I wanted to stay at a decent priced hotel in an area near the metro. The Best Western De Weha looked pretty good online, and there weren't really any bad reviews considering all the reviews I read about other hotels in Paris. The only thing good I have to say about the Best Western De Weha is that it is close to the Place D'Italie Metro station. I was very disappointed in all aspects of this hotel because the lobby area was very shabby and definitely needs some renovating or heavy duty cleaning. The elevator/lift was a joke. It was like a tiny closet and could barely fit 2 people let alone your luggage. When we arrived to our floor, I pratically triped out of the elevator and our room door was right there. On top of that, we are in complete darkness as the lights on our floor were out. I asked the front desk about that and he responded, \"Oh you have to turn on the switch\". I said, \"that is not what I am asking... why were they out?\" and he just repeated, \"You have to turn on the switch\". I think this is totally ridicilous. It is one thing to conserve energy but another to neglect customer safety. Someone could get robbed or trip and get hurt like I did. I tripped and just about hit the door. When we got to our room, it was the size of a prison cell and my husband couldn't even go to the bedroom with the door shut as his legs were hitting the door. I understand that rooms in Paris are relatively small, but this takes the cake. Not to mention we paid about $260 USD per night for this (this was the cheapest hotel that our travel agent gave us that was nearby the metro)! What upset us even more is on our first night there, we got woken up out of a sound sleep at 1:30 AM from a loud fire alarm. Being from New York and having to deal with the September 11th tragedy, I can't begin to tell you the panic that came over us. My husband and I jumped out of bed and ran downstairs & on to the street in our PJ's. The hotel manager on staff told us that it was due to the building getting too hot and caused the fire alarm to go off. He didn't even say sorry. He said it like I was supposed to be ok with this response. Yes I was thankful it wasn't an actual fire, but my nerves were shot after that, and I couldn't go back to sleep. Also the fire alarm was on for about 1/2 hour straight so where the heck was the fire brigade to check things out? That was not comforting at all! The next morning I tried to complain how unhappy we were about the fire alarm and the room size, etc. The woman on staff had no sympathy whatsoever. I asked her if she could move us to a different Best Western as they are all over Paris. With an attitude, she said, \"This is a separate entity, and I need to call the Travel Agency.\" She also said, \"This is Paris, what do I expect\". Our room was prepaid through our Travel Agency or I would have checked out immediately. Also we probably wouldn't be able to get our money back until after we got home as it would have to be credited (and we know how long it takes to get money back), and I didn't have any extra money to spare on another hotel expense as we were on a very tight budget. The next night no fire alarm went off (thank goodness), but a drunk local outside was screaming his head off. Who could sleep at this hotel? I am from NY so I am used to noise, but this was ridicilous with a Capital R!!! This will be the last time I prepay for a hotel, and I am writing a letter to Best Western as this hotel is giving them a bad name.

We ended up here as part of a Eurostar plus hotel deal booked on the Eurostar website. However we were pleasantly surprised that many of the things people complain about here just didn't turn out to be true. I wonder what people are expecting of an inexpensive hotel in an expensive city? People should perhaps know that there are indeed regulations governing the minimum amount of space per guest, but that in France the space is the smallest in Europe. So in Paris, where real estate is extremely expensive, it's no surprise that hotels will use every bit of space they have. It may be slightly facetious of me to say so, but the USA has a lot more space, and probably a lot less expensively. Firstly when we arrived at the hotel we were welcomed very warmly, and the receptionist offered us a map of Paris and pointed out a few of the most important sights. She spoke good English. We met some of the other staff during our stay and if anything, they were even more friendly. On reaching the room on the first floor we were again exepcting the worst, but it was absolutely fine. It was decorated in a pleasant purple in two shades, and, while it was clear that the furniture was of the inexpensive type (especially the bathroom door) it was spotlessly clean, from the carpet up to the ceiling. The bathroom itself was again very clean and fitted to a high standard; in many ways this was the high point of the room. The hotel provided toiletries for us to use. We needed some additional pillows (I don't know how French people ever sleep on just one tiny pillow, which seems to be the norm in France!) and these were provided with no problem. Yes, the double bed was in fact two singles pushed together; I have been to a number of hotels in Europe where this is the case. We were in a first floor room at the front of the hotel, facing the Avenue de Choisy. This is a busy road with many shops and it would be very noisy with the window open. However the room has an air-conditioning unit which obviously means that you would need to keep the window closed in order to get the benefit from it. We didn't use the hotel restaurant for breakfast, since 11 Euros for breakfast seemed very expensive. However, we would recommend the Patisserie-Salon de The on the other side of the Avenue de Choisy. It is run by a Chinese family; the gentleman serving both days we used it spoke good English. There are a number of set-price breakfasts available, and patisseries to die for. Regarding the hotel location: it is not central. However again I would ask why people have such a problem with this? There is a Metro station two minutes' walk away, with frequent trains to anywhere you may want to go (personally I think riding on the Metro is an essential part of the Paris experience but not everyone may share that opinion!) If you intend using the Metro, buy a book of 10 tickets at once (known as a \"Carnet\") because it's quite a bit cheaper than buying individual tickets. The area itself is built up and modern, and yes, it is true that it isn't really in the Latin Quarter, and there are a lot of Chinese and Japanese residents in the area. However we didn't find it unpleasant. There is a fairly large shopping centre (\"Centre Commercial\") just a minute's walk away. Our main problem with this hotel is the general level of internal noise.

Lot of resturants and a very big mall with a grocery store in the basement. This is a huge advantage if you want to buy some food and drinks to save money. (2) Friendly staff. (3) Very clean room and bathroom (4) Reasonably priced. We paid 80e per night (does not include taxes). Now what we did not like: (1) The room is very small, even small for euorpean standards. Only London has rooms smaller than this. My wife and I could not move around at the same time inside the room. (2) The bathroom is also very small but serves the purpose. (3) The tv programs are really bad, not a single english language channel and no CNN either. So, you better take a book to read. (4) Not clearly worded practices by the management. For example, there is a small fridge with food and drinks and they also keep a wine bottle with chips and peanuts on the desk. We thought this was the compliments of the hotel. I have stayed in many many Best Western hotels for hundreds of nights and this is only hotel that charged us for eating the peanuts and chips left by the hotel on the desk. No where it is mentioned that we will be charged. We did not go near the fridge at all. At the same time it is our mistake to assume that food on the desk is free. We should have asked I guess. Lessons learnt!!! We did complain to the management and they did not even care to listen to us. They ended up charging us an arm and a leg for that. On the whole this is not a bad hotel but I would not stay here again. I think I can find something better for the same price. Acutally we did.
