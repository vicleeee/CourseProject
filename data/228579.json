Las Ramblas is a really busy place with the bottom end near the port being rather seedy.Would not have liked to experience this at night.however it was okay in the daytime. Port well worth a walk around and so was the Cathederal. Taxi to Segrada Familia from the old town was about 6 euros, worth it as it would have been a rather long walk. La Boqueria Market on Las Ramblas is fantastic and gets very busy. Eating out is not a problem, plenty of tapas bars to choose from. Hotel was comfortable and excellent value for money. we paid \u00a375 for a twin room with breakfast. The room was basic but cleanand comfortable with toiletries in the bathroom. The breakfast was continental and was very enjoyable. However for us it was all about location being just a couple of minutes walk to the top end of Las Ramblas and Cataluna square.. Would definately recommend this hotel. Barcelona is a very busy city and we had been warned beforehand that pickpockets are rife. We were sensible and kept our wits about us and therefore had no experience of this but feel it is something that travellers should take very seriously.

We spent 2 nights at the Atlantis in early November on a business trip, but had also stayed a few years previously for the same reason. The positives; Location \u2013 a few minutes from Placa Catalunya with all its transport connections including hassle-free bus trips to and from the airport for 4.5 euros each way. Price \u2013 hard to find anything decent in central Barcelona at this price. We go there often on business and this is probably the best option if you want a convenient position. Cleanliness \u2013 not 100% but more than ok. Air con \u2013 necessary as the room was stifling even in November. Beds \u2013 we found them really comfortable, maybe a bit soft for some people, but great for us. The negatives: Rooms \u2013 mostly a choice of noisy room with window & view or quiet room with claustrophobia due to its 1 window opening onto a \u201ccourtyard\u201d i.e. a 3m square shaft running from the ground floor up to the 5th where it\u2019s sealed so no fresh air can get in. Also acts as a loudspeaker if you are unlucky enough to get a noisy couple below whose waking hours are out of sync with yours and who like to have their window open. To increase my feeling of wanting to get out of the room, a portrait of a decapitated nude woman surrounded by splashes of red (blood?), the odd rabbit and other supposedly symbolic objects had been placed opposite the bed. Surrealism or a campaign against the testing of cosmetics on animals? After 2 nights contemplation the jury\u2019s still out... But not really what I wanted to wake up to. Breakfast \u2013 a windowless area with mediocre and unchanging food but pretty well looked after by the staff. My husband\u2019s American breakfast was fine, he assured me. But does it really cost much more to supply real orange juice (in a country renowned for growing citrus fruits) and drinkable coffee? I noticed several savvy couples with Starbucks takeaway cups on their tables from the branch a few minutes\u2019 walk away. But having said this, we\u2019ve had much worse in Barcelona in hotels of around the same price. In one not too far from the Atlantis we found the tables awash with spilt coffee and milk between piles of dirty crockery (they were never cleared until the end of the breakfast period) and nothing edible. To rub salt into the wound of early morning starvation we had to watch a group of Russian tourists being served boiled eggs but no-one else was allowed one, however hard we all grovelled!

We went with Hotel Atlantis due to its more affordable price and recommendation in various travel guides. While we found it an adequate hotel, especially for tourists and travelers looking for decent accommodations in an accessible area of town, we were disappointed in it, but not enough to make us find a new hotel. We asked for a quiet room, not on the main street, based on the reviews about how noisy it can be at Hotel Atlantis. And we did get a quiet room. But it felt more like a cave. Here's why... Sure, there was a window in our room... that looked out onto a tiny enclosed indoor faux atrium that barely had any sunlight filter through. That's it. And that's the only window we saw in the entire hotel during our stay there. No windows in the cafe/breakfast area, no windows at the 'internet cafe.' This made the hotel feel dark and depressing to us. Also, it smelled of overly perfumed cleaning products in the common areas, but with no windows available to open, it became a stifling scent. I felt like I was not allowed to look outside, or like I was in a very unpleasant retirement home. I wish we had changed to a room on the street, as earplugs can help block out sound if needed, and it would've been nice to have a look at the outside world from our room. Anyway, enough about the lack of windows. The room was comfortable enough, a bit outdated and dark, and not quite as clean as our other rooms during our stay, but adequate. The room had a laminate 'wood' floor that felt uneven and not well swept, so I kept a towel on the floor by the bed to wipe debris off my feet before getting into bed. There seems to be flood problems with the shower, as the wall along the bathroom shows obvious water damage on the bedroom side, but we experienced no problems with flooding or the like. A mini-fridge, laser combination safe, and free wi-fi helped us feel more comfortable in our room. Breakfast offered cereals, fruits, pastries, cheeses, and the like, however, it was no where near as nice, as fresh, or as large a spread as we found in our other hotels. We both found the breakfast to be a bit sad, and only ate there once, opting to eat breakfast out and about despite it being included with our room at the hotel. In all, if you just needed a safe, decent place to rest your head in Barcelona and you're not looking for any frills or thrills, you'd be fine here. I would not recommend it for a honeymoon or romantic holiday, however. And I would definitely not recommend it if you're an environmentally sensitive type like myself who needs sunshine and fresh air to be available to stave off feeling ill. At least it was close enough to plenty of transportation that enabled us to spend our days away from 'the cave.' : )", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - City Hotel\u201d", "Author": "BakuBabs", "ReviewID": "UR47811412", "Content": "I liked this hotel because of its location.

The hotel is just off Cataluna Square at the top of Las Ramblas and convenient to all local sites/shopping etc. We were only there one night (Fri 5 Oct) as a pre cruise stay. Check-in was a breeze and the room (508) was small but adequate for 2 people. It looked like it had been recently renovated as the bathroom and fittings all looked new. Overall we would go back to it again.", "Date": "October 14, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Atlantis", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d228579-Reviews-Hotel_Atlantis-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$113 - $166*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Carrer de Pelai 20</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08001</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "228579", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/44/bf/44bf57a535d2db16a3902b8cb384e1c68large.jpg"}}
