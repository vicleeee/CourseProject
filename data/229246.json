{"Reviews": [{"Content": "One Night Stay We stayed overnight at this hotel at the beginning of an Archer's Eastern European tour. The rooms were clean and spacious with large, comfortable beds and there were tv channels in English. The bathroom was also clean and modern. The hotel was within walking distance of a bus stop into Frankfurt city centre and about half a mile away from bars and restaurants. The breakfast was good with a varied choice of hot and cold dishes. The bar at the hotel was nicely decorated in a traditional German style but was a bit pricey. Overall, I wouldn't stay at this hotel if it was for a long stay whilst visiting Frankfurt but for a short term stay it was fine.", "Date": "Aug 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR613423767", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "PeanutDotJU"}, {"Content": "As conferencey as its name       View from our room", "Date": "Apr 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR731623470", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "GK1976"}, {"Content": "One f worst hotels in Frankfurt My wife booked this Holiday Inn for a business strip.The one basic service that any hotel shoudl provide an whjich is being paid for us: TO FACILITATE A GOOD NIGHT REST.This Holiday Inn was not able to provide that basic service. Their qualification of being a 'hotel' is simply false advertising.The beds are all hard as rocks, so a decent sleep is not possible. When one asks the staff to fix this they say they cannot, beyond placing a few extra blankets (dumb idea!).Additionally they require you to pay $22 EUROS PER DAY extra for an Internet connection which would be free in many hotets.This Holiday Inn also misspelled our name severely, which caused the Internet connection to be inaccessible initially.By the way, what ugly room interiors.Finally, I would not recommend this to anyone looking to visit interesting sites in the city. The place is totally in the middle of nowhere.

Received a complimentary upgrade and ended up on the 15th floor which gave fantastic views to the south. The room was spacious and clean and very quiet. All the staff spoke excellent English and were very helpful. The hotel is to the south of Frankfurt but don't let that put you off.Opposite the hotel is a bus stop with a regular service, I have neverwaited more than 10 mins for a bus. A Frankfurt all day ticket cost just over 5 euros, about \u62e23.00, and gives you access to buses,trains and trams.There are a handful of restaurants within walking distance. Within two or three stops on the bus(less than 5 mins) there are plenty of cafes and bars. In about 10 mins you find yourself at Konstablerwache, with it's train station and connections to all over Frankfurt. With some cracking weekend deals this makes an excellent base to explore Frankfurt.", "Date": "Jun 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR163255115", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Noonehasthisname"}, {"Content": "Not quite what i expected Me and a friend stayed here over night before flying back to England. Where the hotel itself was ok, the receptionist was surley when we booked in, we were asked if we wanted to pay upfront so we did but was then asked for 50euro deposit? There was no hotel information book in our room you had to get it off the TV which was fine, only when you clicked onto any thing it gave you basic info if any at all. For a 4 star i at least expected some free bottled water in the room, but you had to pay for everything. The fittness room was another saga! When we finally got in ,there was just a gym several showers and changing rooms plus a sauna and steam room that wasnt working we actually had to go to reception and asked if someone could switch the electric on! and then we were told the sauna and steam room would take half an hour, i would expect this first thing in the morning but not at 5pm in the evening?As i said it was ok, clean well kept but basic for 118 euros a night (at special rate) i was expecting a bit more.

It was the last stop on my journey and the Holiday Inn Frankfurt was amongst my favorite. The lobby and bar had been recently renvoated. The rooms were very spacious and the bathroom was sparkling new. The room had a thermostat, mini bar, etc. The bed and bedding was very comfortable. My room even had a balcony (as did many rooms). The halls were equipped with sensors, so it only turned on if somebody was walking by. Very cool! My included meal at the hotel was good and included waiter service. The dining room had a beautiful view. There's a business center, with free internet. I suppose what makes this hotel exception is the staff. They are excellent. I have stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel, and I felt my stay at the Holiday Inn could not have been better. They understand that a good stay at a hotel is not just about decor, but also hospitality. The day of my departure, I had to leave the hotel at 5:30 to catch an 8:30 flight. The tour director arranged for myself and 2 other travellers to take a taxi. When we checked out of the hotel, the receptionist gave us a lunch box. Inside there were 2 sandwiches, water, juice, yogurt, 2 fruits, granola bars and candy. It was a nice thought because the breakfast room wasn't opened. The receptionist hailed us a taxi and we were on our way. About a block from the hotel, one of my fellow travelers couldn't find his passport in his carryon and thought maybe he left it in the hotel. The cab driver circled back to the hotel and he ran inside. Soon, he came out fellowed by the two receptionist, who helped him get the luggage out of the trunk and helped him look. They didn't find the passport in his room and thought maybe he packed it in his luggage. It was a surprising scene. When it wasn't inside the luggage, the traveller said, it must be on the bus. One of the receptionist ran inside and was going to wake up the tour director and bus driver. Luckily before he woke them up, we found the passport in his carry on. We all had a good laugh, and the cab driver drove us to the airport. This all transpired at about 5:45 AM. .I only managed to see the name tag of one of the receptionists, (they were moving so fast) Herr Schmidt, and they were truly wonderful.", "Date": "Jun 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR383025437", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "tacobar"}, {"Content": "Lovely Hotel Warm and friendly service.

I went and advised them off this, and the front desk told me it was my fault for assuming Queen Beds are double!!!

The food was good, wine selection great, and in particular there were some great beers from some micro-breweries available in the hotels old-styled pub. Our only negative feelings came from the Fitness Center; we were disappointed in the exercise equipment provided and the tiny amount of space it was crammed into, and the attendants there were a bit on the cranky side, but it was clean and the whirlpools and saunas were great!

My girlfriend and I stay there for our vacation for 9 days. So the room was very important. The room was very nicely appointed. It was strangely cut, due to fact that the hotel is round, but extremly spacious. There was plenty of closet space and two comfy chairs with a longe table. The king size bed was very comfortable. There balcony view was nice of downtown Frankfurt. The room was very pleasent for the long stay. The decor was very liviable, a european art deco mixed with function. The hotel is far enough from the major sites and close enough to be in just the right locationThe two resturants in the hotel have above average food. The brunch buffet was excellent. It was a good start for the days tourist events. The fair is lite, just right for a day of running around Frankfurt.This hotel was intended to serve as a confrence hotel. But the staff was extremly friendly, and knew us by face by the second day. Know that we were stayinf for more then a week, they weived the 10 euro parking fee/day, that was extremly nice of them.But what sets this hotel above the other Holiday Inns I stayed at is the staff. They all knew us by face by the end of the thrid day. Tourist coming in at all time at nite.One day I lost my wallet, a tourist's worse nightmare, I hotel inform the hotel I lost my wallet. The staff quick track down all the number I would have to call to get a new credit card next day to me. All this was done in couple of minutes. It put my girlfriend mind to rest. We had an wondeful time in frankfurt, and a great stay at the Holiday Inn. The nice this is that someone found my wallet, turn it in to police. And I got my wallet back the next day. The staff quickly notifide me. I did not lose a bit of sleep over what could have been a complete trip ruining event.
