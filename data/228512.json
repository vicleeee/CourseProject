As a woman traveling alone for business I felt very safe in the area. There is a school across one of the streets, so at school breaks you will find tons of children and parents in the streets, but I never found my room to be noisy despite the intermittent crowd. The wi-fi is reliable in the rooms, and zippy enough for video conferencing, which was very helpful.

I think that could be a problem. Business trips can become boring and a few pleasant surprises help to lift up the mood. The rooms size is good but luckily I got a bigger room on my last visit. It was not a surprise since at 250 euros a night I was expecting better value. On an average I would rate it as a 100 euro hotel and once it is a fully integrated Marriott do not expect anything less than 200 for the same. I do not think I would stay here again as one is spoilt for choice in Barcelona and as long as you are close to Plaza Catalunya & Passeig De Gracias you should be fine. Best points are: free mini bar, location, nice bed and friendly staff (front office). It also has smoking rooms / floor (which is good for me) Bad points are: the wifi internet does not work in the rooms (I have tried all the different cards and companies) and expensive breakfast. If you can manage a price of 150 euros it is still value but anything more than that is a rip-off. I also feel that a business hotel must have the best internet. There would be a lot of travelers who would like to sit in their room late nights in comfortable clothing and work on their mails & presentations rather than sitting in the lobby trying to figure out which chair/sofa would be comfortable and quiet ....

One of the things that we found out the hard way was that this hotel is used by Holland America for any cruise passengers that want to extend their stay at the end of their trip. When we arrived the lobby was complete chaos! There were about 100 senior citizens in the lobby waiting to check in. Only one person was checking people in and 2 others were just standing around. We weren't part of the group so the bell hop told us to just walk up to the desk and not bother waiting. When we approached the desk they said they were for check out only and that they couldn't check us in even though there was no one to check out. So basically that person was standing there useless. We stood in line for an hour and all the cruise ship seniors kept cutting in front of us (which I get isn't really the hotel's fault but they clearly need a better process to deal with mass amount of people while not ticking off other customers!) After the first hour we gave up and abandoned our bags in the lobby to go get some food and explore the city. We returned hours later to check in and decided to complain about the poor service. We asked to talk to a manager who didn't even bother to apologize for our bad experience until about 5 minutes into the conversation and even then it wasn't a real apology. She even tried to tell us that there was more than one person checking people in even though there wasn't. NOT the way to deal with an unhappy customer!!! This is the SERVICE industry!!! The ONLY reason we stayed there was because it was already pre-paid on my credit card. Within a 4 block radius there are numerous other hotels that all looked like they would be a lot better! Now the room!! GROSS!!! It looked like a hockey team had partied in it. Every piece of furniture was dented, scratched or in some way damaged! NOT AT ALL LIKE THE PICTURES!!! And in the bathroom SOMETHING was growing on the shower tile. We didn't even bother to complain again given our first experiences with the front desk.

This time we found the street noise distressing but the first time we'd looked over a back area and it was much quieter. Quiet is not easy to come by in Barcelona. The street view was not particularly attractive in our eyes, although it gave us natural light and kind-of fresh air and the streets around here are a Barcelona attraction. We were reasonably high up, and imagine that the ambience would deteriorate going down. We had paid for a superior room: I wonder if our original room was a standard room and not as highly regarded because it didn't have the view of the streets. I had remembered about the complimentary minibar, but it only had beer for one person, not two. We like to enjoy a beer when we first arrive somewhere, when we're settling in. Instead of appreciating it being free, we were disgruntled about having to share the one. They knew the room was being booked for two, so there's no excuse that most guests seemed to be solo business travellers or groups. Wifi in the room was paid, but it was free down in the lobby. The reception staff did not explain how to log on to it, so I had to ask again for specific instructions after failing to get on. I'd thought I'd sit there, do emails and have a quiet drink but nobody ever came to take an order, which I guess was healthier for me, if not for the hotel's profits, and the bar didn't have anything particularly interesting to offer. The best service was at the door. The assistance with luggage when we arrived was much appreciated. We had lots of bits and pieces and needed to get them inside securely, check in and to have the luggage looked after while we returned a rental car several kms away. I was conscious of security and the door staff also made a point of reminding me (sensible of them, as many people are woefully naive when on holidays). When we returned the luggage had all been taken up to the room. A taxi also was arranged promptly when it was needed when we were departing. That was the exception when it came to staff. We came back from breakfast on our first morning there to find our room being cleaned, and the chambermaid wanted to finish all the elements of the job; I had to specifically tell her not to. Service was also distinctly lacking at the breakfast area. The arrangement for coffee seemed to be self service. Not only does this disrupt meals, but guests weren't being told that this was the case and had to either eventually ask when they were going to get their coffee, or work it out for themselves. Both the room and breakfast service indicates processes and training that are driven by efficiencies rather than delivering good customer experience. I don't think I'll be back a third time.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Diplomatic Hotel Barcelona", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d228512-Reviews-Diplomatic_Hotel_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$222 - $318*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Pau Claris 122</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08009</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "228512", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d7/3b/d73b8298462020be0757a3d21fad6f3a8large.jpg"}}
