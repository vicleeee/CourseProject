{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Decent business hotel The Relexa Hotel is a decent business hotel, but not somewhere you'd want to stay unless you had reason to be in the area. On the good side: I found the staff very efficient and competent -- and capable of handling a couple of special requests without missing a beat. The decor is not to my taste (orange zebra stripes) but my room was clean and had decent amenities (minibar fridge, wireless internet for a fee, electric kettle, etc). On the down side: not all the rooms have air conditioning, and the room service (while prompt) has few healthy options. It's mostly of the cheeseburger/pizza variety. The staff were very good, but the hotel is just okay.", "Date": "May 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR137755105", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "field-guide"}, {"Content": "Carpets need a good cleaning I stayed at this hotel with some colleagues this week and while it's a nice hotel with all the amenities one would expect from a business area hotel, I was extremely disappointed at the conditions of the carpeting in my room and other sections of the hotel.There were stains everywhere and even though the room was classified as a non-smoking room, there was a distinct smell of old tobacco that I couldn't overcome. Thus, I kept the window open for the day and night.The bar was OK and the breakfast buffet was average, however to me cleanliness is paramount to me staying at a hotel while on business travels and I must say I will never stay there again until they do something about their awfully dirty carpets.", "Date": "Feb 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR622009963", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "GorillaMan1959"}, {"Content": "OK very clean and quite Nice clean towels and bathroom very nice i wish we have this hotels i athens very nice", "Date": "Jun 9, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR917286954", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "MalLakis"}, {"Content": "devoid of any charm This is basically a Flat-Pack hotel erected in a business park on the northern outskirts of Frankfurt. It would be useful if you were on a tight timetable and visiting any of the businesses in that area. This is not hotel to go to if you are a tourist, budget traveller or a businessesman looking to hold meetings or conferences.Aside from the location, there is nothing wrong with this hotel, but it is totally charmless, in a totally charmless area. If you do decide to stay here, make sure you get a good price. Due to its captive audience (being the only hotel in the immediate area) it often charges the same rate as far superior hotels downtown. Watch out for the pillows as well. They are extremely uncomfortable.", "Date": "Jun 8, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR501734122", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Sch\u679anes Hotel mit tollem Personal   showReview(8236074, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR131283172", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Mondfeger"}, {"Content": "jederzeit wieder   showReview(11358710, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR473816346", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Gerne wieder; sehr zentrale aber ruhige Lage   showReview(11358709, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR493424560", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d230355-r16109012-Relexa_Hotel_Frankfurt_Main-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "230355", "Price": "$261"}}
