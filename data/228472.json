Tickets cost 2 Euros and may be bought on board. There are stops at terminals T1, T2 and T4. We arrived at Terminal 1 and easily found the bus stop on the right hand side of Arrivals when exiting the terminal. The bus is painted half yellow, so is easy to spot. We had a wait of about 15 minutes before getting on a bus, and noted that if we wanted to catch a taxi there would have been a similar wait. The luggage is stored internally to reduce delays. The journey took about 35 minutes and we got off at the second stop; Plaza Cibeles. To get to the hotel from Plaza Cibeles, we walked along Calle Gran Via, one of the main roads in Madrid. There is a \u201cY\u201d junction along the route, so make sure that you take the right hand side of the junction. The walk took us about 20 minutes. The hotel is on a corner between Calle Gran Via and Calle de Masonero Romanos (a narrow side turning). The name of the hotel is only visible over the entrance in the side turning. The lobby of the hotel was small for the size of the building, but we were directed to the reception desk on the first floor, reached via a lift. The reception staff were very helpful and provided us with information on what to see in the city. We requested a room on an upper level and were given a choice of third floor inner, or fourth floor outer overlooking Calle Gran Via. We chose the latter and were not disappointed. The room was of medium size (sizes vary), which was adequate and we could only just hear the traffic. The condition and facilities within the room were of a high standard and the room was clean and well maintained by the staff. The hotel does not have a restaurant for evening meals and this is not necessary given the plethora of tapas bars and restaurants surrounding the hotel. It does however have a well maintained breakfast room and there is a good selection of hot and cold breakfasts, including fresh orange juice (not the usual syrup) and freshly baked croissants, which I found very tasty. If having tea, make sure that you are given a hot pot of water and not a tepid one. Our overall impression of the hotel was very good and it justified its 4 star status. The hotel is within walking distance of many of the attractions, including the old town and many shops. We purchased the 2 day tickets for the Madrid City Tour bus from the hotel reception; 24 Euros for adults, 12 Euros for seniors (over 65). The buses ran every 15 minutes and were a handy way of getting around and seeing the sites, allowing passengers to get on and off as many times as they wish. This enabled us to quickly establish the location of the sites and shops within walking distance of the hotel. There are many splendid buildings and museums to see in Madrid and both bus routs cover the majority of them, but the Route 1 bus probably covers the better half. Our evenings were spent in a selection of tapas/pinchos bars and restaurants, consuming the delightful Spanish food and wine. One of the restaurants to the rear of the hotel was the \u201cPublic\u201d restaurant, which is located by turning left when exiting the hotel, then turning second left onto Calle Del Desenga\u00f1o, the road which runs parallel to Calle Gran Via (see reviews). The restaurant is modern and clean and served by efficient staff. The prices are very reasonable, for both the excellent food and wine. Also, pay a visit to the Plaza Mayor and take lunch in the square. Just outside of the square is an undercover tapas area known as Mercado de San Miguel, it looks like a market place from the outside, but inside is an array of tapas bars, where you can purchase tapas and wine and wander from one bar to the other. Another tapas bar that we enjoyed was \u201cStop\u201d, on Calle Hortaleza (no. 11), just a short walk from Calle Gran Via and close to the hotel. This is a traditional tapas bar that had a wide selection of tasty tapas and wines, and if you ask for a brandy you will get at least four times the UK measurement.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lynchburg, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cQuiet and Convenient in Madrid\u201d", "Author": "EscapingtheBurg", "ReviewID": "UR128046646", "Content": "My wife, daughter, and I arrived in Madrid on a morning flight from the USA.

Our room was away from the main street, Calle Gran Via, so it was very quiet with no street noise. The location was very good for Metro stations and a short 10 to 12 minute walk to Plaza Espana where we met tour buses for half day tours through Julia Travel. The location is also convenient to many restaurants, shopping, and other tourist sites such as Palacio Real. We had a large triple room (3 beds) with ample room. Our room was made up nicely each day by the maid service. Breakfast was included and had a nice variety of meats, fresh fruits, and breads.

Note that the street outside was busy 20 hours of the day/night during the holiday season. This was certainlyh expected along this main street. Expect typical noise from a busy central city street including ambulances, police, trash trucks, shoppers and people partying in the City. We didn't care but it might bother those light sleepers. I preferred being able to look out and enjoyed the street scenes. Ideal for nearby shopping, restaurants, bus stop and metro stations. Metro stations for 4 different lines within 2 minute walk from hotel. ATM located one minute from hotel along Gran Via. Several tapas bars within 500 yards of hotel. City Tour bus stop 1 minute away. No real need for taxis while staying at this hotel. We never felt unsafe although the evenings brought out some very interesting characters north of the hotel along the sidestreet. Rooms - Well maintained, comfortable size by European standards. Appears to have been improved with relatively recent modernization of bathroom and sleeping area. Bathroom fixtures and shower/tub were more than functional. Twin beds were comfortable. Didn't use the TV much. Wifi was 8 euro for 24 hours, a tad pricey and the range was very limited near the window. Housekeeping was very efficient and kept the room tidy.

The only thing i did not like was that i felt the room was a bit too warm for my comfort but it suits my son and husband perfectly! The room included breakfast and the breakfast buffet was awesome! They have different cold cuts (of course i always get the ham!), some hot entrees that were ok, good assortment of cheeses, wonderful pastries and awesome croissants! They have amazing coffee, hot chocolates and espresso! Don't forget to try their fresh yogurt as they are delicious! Certainly none i can find back in the US !

We purchased the room at an unusually good rate from Travelocity. It was close to or over $200 on other hotel sites. But we paid around $118 which beat anything for similar quality on Priceline or Hotwire. Location: Central Madrid, right on the Gran Via. The hotel is midway between Gran Via and Callao on the Metro. If you don't want the inconvenience of changing trans, you should consider a cab from the airport as both stations require two stops. Which every station you come out, if you look down the Gran Via, you can see a sign that says Tryp Cibeles on the side of a building. The hotel entrance is down a small alley. There is a guard who has a list of all arriving guests. He will check your ID. The check in is one floor up. The alley is not some dank scary alley if that's what you are thinking. There are a lot of tables belonging to the eatery next door. One of the best locations I could imagine. A short walk to the Prado, Royal Palace, Opera, Puerta del Sol. If you want to walk, you can. If you want to take the subway, buy an \u201cAbono Turistico\u201d at the airport subway station. The passes are good for one or two days and are a great bargain. Check-in: Very quick and easy. Check is in 12:00 and we got in a bit early. They had no problems accommodating us in a King Room. The staff speaks decent English. They require all hotels guests to provide ID so have passports for everyone available. Room: Cozy and clean. Our room did not face the Gran Via which may be the source of some of the noise complaints on other review. We had ZERO problems with noise in our room. Please keep in mind that in order to turn on the lights, you have to slip your key card into a socket on the wall. Nothing works otherwise. The air conditioner works a bit slowly and the room was pretty stuffy until it got going. The \u201cking bed\u201d was really two twins pushed together. Didn't really cause a problem, but its something one should be aware of. We had plenty of closet space. The room has a safe, TV, refrigerator. The fridge is always a nice touch in case we want to get some fruit or cold cuts at the market. There is in-room internet if you have a computer with you. The floors are linoleum with tile in the bath. The bath was nice but dark. My wife mentioned that putting on makeup was difficult. The hotel provides hand soap, shaving kit, dental kit and shower cap. Bath soap and shampoo were in a dispenser inside the shower. Plenty of towels. Service: I thought it was quite good. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They will help with restaurant reservations and directions. The guard downstairs had no problems remembering our faces after we first met him. I would not use the internet cafe in the lobby if you are going to spend a lot of time on it. One desk clerk pointed out that the Zahara coffee shop across the street has an internet cafe on the second floor and its a bit cheaper. We did not get food in the hotel There is a supermarket in the department store at Callao metro where we bought small things for breakfast. The restaurant next door has decent pizzas and other items and is relatively affordable. Overall: We were very pleased. The location is second to none. We had no problems with noise. There were hookers roaming around the alley, although at the far end of the street is a sex shop which may or may not be your style. Everything was comfortable and the staff did a good job for us.

We caught a rather rubbery cold scrambled egg presentation one morning and very over boiled sausages-the food is on display from 7-11am. No restaurant and the bar is very quiet; the waiter is called by telephoning from the bar! Nippy hotel booze prices unfortunately.

Overall it was a pleasant stay and we enjoyed our short break in Madrid. The good points first: 1. The hotel is less than 1 min walk from Callao Metro station and basically you could walk to all attractions from this base. 2. The rooms are spacious, clean and beds are comfortable. 3. Breakfast buffet is good with a mix of hot and cold choices. Now the not so good points: 1. One of the rooms we were allocated was along the Gran Via which gave us great photos opportunities, but for the guy who stayed in the room it was not so great. He was kept awake by the sirens and noisy street crowds into the early hours and he had to buy ear plugs for the 2nd night stay. We had 2 rooms around the side of the building one of which I stayed in and being a light sleeper I had no trouble staying asleep at all! So that's something to bear in mind when booking a room. 2. Check-in was extremely slow and almost painful worsen by the fact that the website we booked our rooms with had given the wrong guest name to the hotel for one of the rooms. I think in total check-in took almost 30 mins! 3. They tried to charge us for breakfast even though the guy at check-in had confirmed we had breakfast included for the 1st morning. We refused to pay and told the breakfast guy to check with the receptionist. 2nd morning we ate at Vips down the road and that was a perfectly decent breakfast without all the hassle.

There is a security guard on the downstairs door who checks who is going in & out (good for security). Checking in was quick & easy, very professional & pleasant staff. We had asked for a room with a terrace & view of the Gran Via (it said on the website when booking that you had to pay more for these rooms but we got it for the standard rate) & we were allocated a corner room on the 5th floor with 2 terraces & fantastic views up & down the Gran Via, looking towards the Plaza d'Espana you could see the snow covered mountains in the distance. Unfortunately it was too cold to make use of the terraces, but worth it for the views. The room was clean & welcoming and the air con when turned on warmed the room nicely. It was a typical Tryp room with firm but comfortable beds, wi fi internet access (small charge) mini bar & very nice bathroom. Nothing exciting, but pleasant enough. The only downside was that, although the windows were double glazed, it wasn't enough & the sound of sirens did wake us up. Oh, well, one of the drawbacks of staying on the Gran Via!

As others have mentioned, the reception desk is on the first floor. Upon our arrival, we were greeted in the ground floor lobby by an elderly doorman who understood zero English, and who guarded the entrance to his territory jealously and refused to let us pass! His attitude was spectacularly unhelpful, and it quickly became clear that he lacked either the initiative or the inclination to fetch somebody from reception who understood English. It took a good 5-10 minutes of politely insisting that we had a reservation in our rudimentary and poorly accented Spanish, during which time he became progressively ruder and ruder, before the penny finally dropped that we were indeed bona fide guests, rather than a band of ruffians masquerading as middle class English people. Once we did manage to actually make it to reception the staff did make us very welcome; however, this was not a good start, and for a 4 star hotel we felt it was a bit poor to entrust the greeting of hotel guests to a graduate of the Basil Faulty school of customer service training. On the plus side: Great location, and very nicely appointed and comfortable rooms which were spotlessly clean. On the minus side: We had rooms facing the Gran Via, and although the noise didn't bother me, it kept some of the other people I travelled with awake. When I tried to register my MAS card upon arrival (which would have entitled the second person in each room we had booked to a free breakfast during our stay) the person I spoke to in reception insisted that it had to be done when we checked out. (So: did we get the free breakfasts? Nope.) When we checked out, the mini-bar tab also appeared on our bill twice, and it took quite a bit of persuasion to convince the hotel of this and get them to adjust it. Our attempts to have a drink in the bar on the first night were also frustrated by the fact that it was unstaffed. After hanging around for 20 minutes waiting to be served, we gave up and didn't bother again for the rest of our stay. In conclusion: As this was our first trip to Madrid, we had no other hotels in the city to compare it with. However, compared to other 4 star hotels in general, and 4 star hotels owned by the same chain we've stayed at in the past, the service was rather hit and miss and we wouldn't choose to stay there again for that reason.", "Date": "November 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea", "Title": "\u201cGood Location\u201d", "Author": "frandy", "ReviewID": "UR4084672", "Content": "Best thing about the hotel is its location.

By far the best things, though, about the hotel are: 1) the location, which is right in the city centre, very well served with metro stations, and the ideal place for visiting all that Madrid has to offer; and 2) the price! A couple of very minor things ... the smoke detector immediately over the bed had a flashing light on it which could not be switched off. Also would not recommend straying into the area immediately behind the hotel north of Gran Via. It gets pretty unpleasant pretty quickly! Finally there was a pay TV card next to the bed advertising a selection of 12 movies, 6 of which were \"adult only\", one of which had a pretty nasty title. I found this a bit distasteful, and it certainly isn't something you'd want to find if you had children with you. Small points, though, as it was an ideal base for a fantastic 2 days in Madrid ... and very reasonably priced!", "Date": "October 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cJust a basic 4*\u201d", "Author": "Mag_Mile_Girl", "ReviewID": "UR4044490", "Content": "A very basic 4* hotel in a very good location.

The hotel is right on the Gran Via above a Zara Store - so it's easy walking distance to most of the major sites. It's true that the lobby is not on the main floor and the entrance is on a side street but I didn't find this an impediment in anyway. The staff were very friendly and efficient and spoke English. One drawback was that when you take the elevator to the lobby - you can open up a crowded and small space for check-in so it makes sense to leave your luggage with the bellhop (I rarely do this as hey - I managed to get my luggage all the way from my house to Madrid - so why pay to have it taken the last 50m). We stayed here twice on our trip (going to Barcelona in between) and had 2 different rooms but both with a little balcony facing busy Gran Via (photos provided) which was great for watching the city go by or see the sunset. Even though this street was busy, the windows cancelled any noise. The rooms were spotlessly clean with recent hardwood floors and new bedding. I'm very fastidious when it comes to the cleanliness of hotels, and the Cibeles was top notch on this account. Bathrooms were equally spotless and very new. Spain - as many hotels in Europe - have bidets and these seem to be the first to go when it comes to cleanliness but Cibeles bathrooms were gleaming. My girlfriend was so happy to be back at this hotel after the ancient and dire Continental Ramblas in Barcelona. Rooms were of a good size, though the 2nd room was a bit smaller as was the balcony. We don't often use the extra facilities in a hotel so we didn't eat in the hotel restaurant though we did get room service on the last day and was robbed as you would at any hotel for the privilege - although the food was good. Overall, We'd definitely stay here again - wouldn't even bother researching other hotels next time we go back to Madrid.", "Date": "May 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester, uk", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "nikdey", "ReviewID": "UR3306568", "Content": "Hotel is very average.
