I was happy with the spacious rooms and great breakfast, but there were a few problems that interfered with my business trip: - Internet connection was slow or non-existent due to challenges from Telefonica, the service provider; it was possible to work from the lobby as many of us did, where the connection was good - There was water dripping from the ceiling in the bathroom, so you had to keep towels on the sink and floor in order not to hear \"drip, drip\" at night. I was offered to change the room as this was not something that could have been fixed, but I just think that no rooms should have this problem to begin with. - I had a phone stolen from my room, and the management did address the issue, they compensated for one night stay, which ended up being 1/4 of expenses that I incurred due to the missing phone (someone has ran up my bill).

In the bathroom, numerous signs of wear and botched touching up. This budget experience was also reflected in other areas. Whilst I expect to pay extra for things like wifi when staying in a low-cost hotel, I don't expect to do so when having what AC describe as a luxury experience.

The rooms were well apportioned and comfortable and the bathroom was a good size. The minor criticisms I have were that it would have been a little cleaner in the room (although that is me being quite picky), the room smelled a little of smoke (probably a historical issue as it is a difficult smell to get rid of) and the air conditioning in our room was not working properly, which gave is quite a hot night. I am sure they would have fixed it or moved us if we had said something but by the time we realised we were in bed and needed to get up early, so we couldn't be bothered to say anything as time was running short. We had dinner in the rooms which was fine - not exceptional but certainly passable. Free minibar was a nice touch which other hotels should do.

Just a few issues. We had a tiny kitchenette attached - it had a water heater/coffee maker that only gave out warm (not hot) water - a kettle would be better! Some of the food (buffet breakfast and room service) wasn't good. It wasn't very fresh. The chicken salad was deep fried chicken nuggets with salad and floppy bacon (ie, not very healthy). Same for goats cheese salad. And the worst, we ordered a chocolate desert that came with mould on it! It went back and of course it was taken off the bill (we didn't want a replacement...). The staff were professional and polite, however their English was limited, so I'm not sure they understood the problem (though the mould was visible!).

The location isn't perfect, it is about six blocks from the nearest metro stop. There's nothing interesting around the hotel, nothing of interest to a tourist. By the metro, however, are shopping and restaurants. The hotel is just off the beaten path (but in a very safe area, no worries about walking). I dealt with pretty much all of the front desk staff during my stay. Some were friendly from the get-go, most were pretty reserved, and one woman was downright unfriendly for the first half of my stay. However, she eventually warmed up to me as I worked hard at being nice. Still, it was pretty offputting to be paying a crazy nightly rate and have dismissive service at times. I will say that I had some odd requests and the front desk did have to go out of their way to serve me, which they did. My suite was new, modern and spotless. It began with an entryway alcove with a mini-fridge which held only beverages - free beverages! Sodas, waters and one beer, they were replenished daily. The next space was a parlor with a couch and coffee table, and a work desk. Internet (wi-fi) was expensive and had to be purchased at the front desk, you could buy cards for an hour or 24 hours. You couldn't use the same card for multiple computers, even if you were only using one machine at a time. There was a nice flat-screen TV on a rolling cart that you could roll to face the parlor or the bedroom. The only station in English was CNN. The beds would have been comfortable except that my king bed was two twins pushed together. Other rooms had true kings, so be sure to check before you settle on your room, if that is important to you. Two twins pushed together is as useful as one twin, since you can't stretch out. The bathroom was nice, modern, no complaints there. There was no air-conditioning available, though I think they do have it in the summer, but not the winter. But I thought the room was way too warm, especially overnight. My rate included the breakfast buffet, which was a wonderful spread of meats, cheeses, pastries, yogurt, cereal, fruits. Pretty much anything (cold) that you could desire. Had I been a tourist I would have eaten late and this would have more than covered lunch for me. Overall, I did have a good stay at this hotel.
