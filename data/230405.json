It is very close to the via veneto, where you will find many good restaurants. the closest metro station is the Spagna, but you will have to walk for about 10 minutes to reach it, and the good thing is that once you exit the hotel and walk toward via veneto, you will see an underground tunnel which will take you straight to the metro station. So you don't have to cross any streets or look for it, this tunnel will save you that trouble. Walking to the main shopping street of via del corso took us around 20 minutes, but we didn't mind since the weather was nice. Once we reached the via del corso, it took us another 10 min to reach the trevi fountain. The only complain about this hotel is the room key card. The magnetic stripe is really sensitive. Put it in your wallet or near your cell phone and it will immediately stop working. We had to go to the reception to get it reprogrammed every time we came back. The other complain is the dull and dark entrance to the hotel.

The location makes it difficult for taxi's to get to we got lucky once flagging down a taxi before noticing that there is a taxi stand just on the other side of the wall. But it's a one way \"exit\" off a main street so getting back, I just had taxi's drop us off a few blocks from the hotel instead of making all sorts of turns to get in front of the hotel. Via Veneto is nice, restaurants and bars along the main street are expensive and even though major sites (Spanish Steps, Fountain Trevi are said to be 0.5 or 0.7 miles, there are steep hills so expect to just take taxi's around. Metro in Rome isn't very useful to get where you want to go either. Hotel was basic. Hardwood floors in my room were pretty warn and dusty/dirty.

The staff was providing a high performance on everything, always smiling, even under stress situations, so I do not absolutely agree with some other visitor saying that the staff was rude. This is offensive in my opinion. Rooms are excellent, if you don't believe it just take a trip to various other hotels in Rome and compare them with those offered by this hotel.

Our rooms are on 3rd floor and far away from the lifts but very spacious compare to other European hotels. Rooms are facing the garden but somehow couple of nights before dawn there were very noise as the sound like people throwing garbage into the truck.

We flew in to Fiumicino airport with the intention of taking the train to Termini but after following the train signs around the airport for a while, we realised the train symbol had disappeared. Whilst we were dithering about, we were pounced upon by a man offering us a ride in his minibus (\"room for 2 more, I will take you direct to your hotel, 30 euros only\") and thought \"why not?\". It is an understatement to say the journey was 'interesting' and was a great introduction to Rome! The driver was a bit of a character (90 miles per hour, 6 inches from the car bumber in front, one hand on the wheel, talking on the phone) and as we were were the last of 4 couples to be dropped off, we got a great city tour plus commentary for our money!. The hotel is spotlessly clean, modern and the staff pleasant and efficient. We had a standard room (no view, just the building next door) but we were more than happy with this as we planned to spend no time at the hotel other than sleeping and breakfasting. The breakfast is unbelievable - egg, bacon, sausages, tomatoes, tea coffee, croissants, pastries, cakes, doughnuts, toast, cereal, museli, yoghurt, fruit juice, ham, salami, cheese , fruit and I think there must be things I have left off! There were plenty of tables and all the food was kept well 'topped up'. We were delighted with the location as we were within an easy walking distance of so many of the sites, although we caught the metro from Barberini when we went to the Colusseum and from Spagna when we went to the Vatican. The Metro is easy to use but quite shabby compared to the London Underground. Drink in Rome is horrendously expensive (6 or 7 Euros for a beer) although we felt the food was reasonably priced. We didn't eat anywhere fancy but there are so many lovely little restaurantes, trattorias etc down the side streets to choose from you can spend as much or as little as you want. I found the city streets pleasingly clean ( the very efficient bin men were out every night) and there were no horrible rubbish sacks or wheelie bins littering the streets unlike London (where we had a day out the previous weekend). I strongly recommend a good street map and comfortable footwear as the best way to see Rome is by walking - there are so many beautiful little back streets and piazzas to wander around it would be a crime to miss them by travelling in a taxi.

The receptionist kindly told us that such a room was not ready yet so we would have to wait till usual check in time, that is till 1400. When we asked if we could have a glance to normal, non-park view rooms, the gentle staff promptly guided us to the upper floors and, also,even showed us a park view room which was however somewhat on the ground floor- just to have an idea of what the view would look like so as to compare and contrast. We decided that waiting would be undoubtedly worth it and so it was! Upon return, we were given a card to a splendid room, number 610. It was located on the sixth floor and it also had a balcony. The view was of course stunning, Villa Borghese was right in front of us! The decoration, which is identical in all the rooms shown to us, was really modern and stylish . The double bed was king size and absolutely comfy. The bathroom was another pleasant surprise taken that it was always modern,spotlessly clean, had a bathtube and all imaginable toiletries, even toothbrushes and a small container of disinfectant liquid to take with you, great if you want to clean your hands on the spot. Not to add the fact that the rooms are soundproof. As far a sthe breakfast is concerned, I have stayed at many hotels since I travel a lot and I gladly reassure you that Nh offers you a great breakfast where nothing is really missing : a WIDE range of fresh juices, cakes, various sweets, meats,cheese, bread, milk, jam, omellete, sausages etc. The breakfast area is also a pro, well organised and tastefully designed to satisfy the Nh standards. Last, I would no doubt like to stress out the kindness of the staff. Apart form the fact that they were always smiling and willing to offer some typical \" tourst\" piece of advice, they surprised us when we asked them whether they knew a nice cinema broadcasting a certain 3D film . Thus, not only did the receptionist informed us on nearby cinemas and called them on our behalf but she also printed for us the cinema schedule, an act which we instantly appreciated! The only Nh con is maybe the fact that the metro di Spagna ( the ENTRANCE to which is 5 minutes from the hotel), is not that close after all since you have to walk underground for some 10-15 minutesto reach the ACTUAL station-platform (which is basically located at Piazza di Spagna)This may be a bit boring if you do it everyday but, still, I consider this a minor detail.

Staff were variable, some cool and frosty, and some warm and friendly. Breakfast had good fresh fruit and juices, together with the usual continental offerings. Delicious chocolate torte should not be missed. Location is good, right next to the Villa Borghese but you need to like walking, as it is a fair distance to the Spanish steps and other sights in the historic centre. The walk was pleasant in mid- May, but I wouldn't like to do it in the heat of July/Aug.

Fantastic hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "HHowells", "ReviewID": "UR26250536", "Content": "Our purpose of visiting Rome was to watch the Italy V Wales 6 Nations rugby match. We booked via a local travel agent called Robert Davies Sports Travel and one of our friends chose the hotel from a list provided by the agent. On finding out that the chosen hotel was the 'Jolly Vittorio Veneto' , as always I consulted my trusty Tripadvisor for reviews, albeit with jittery fingers as on this occasion I was resigned to the fact that however good or bad the reviews were, the selection was beyond my control! On doing so I was rather deflated and disappointed by the comments on the dated, tired 70s feel of the hotel and the indifference of the staff. So on Thursday 12th March I set off full of excitement about Wales beating Italy (which they did!!!) the fantastic atmosphere that awaited us and revisiting some of the sights we'd marvelled over during my husband and my first trip to Rome 5 years ago! The shine was slightly dulled by my apprehensions over the accommodation! On arrival at the hotel I had the most wonderful surprise!! 'Jolly Vittorio Veneto' was no more!! It had changed hands and had become 'NH Vittorio Veneto'! We had stayed in a wonderful NH hotel in Salzburg and the initial sightings of this Roman sister were looking familiar and promising! The reception area, bar and dining room were modern and delighfully decorated and accessorised, the reception staff were friendly and efficient (unphased by the scores of unbeat Welsh rugby fans descending upon them!!) Up we went in the brand spanking new lift and along the brand spanking newly decorated corridor to our room which was light, colourful, minimalist and spotless! The bedroom was adequate in size and hosted a large wall mounted plasma TV with a lovely lime-green surround. The bathroom was all brown tiles and floor -again very contemporary and tasteful-with clean lines. The bed was comfortable and because it was obviously so new it was about the first time ever that I did not wake up each morning with a sniffly nose and puffy eyes due to old dust mites!! My husband often suffers terribly with this as he has asthma and even he didn't have any problems! The breakfast was pleasant, largely the usual continental breakfast with a good selection but scrambled eggs, bacon and little sausages were also on offer The lovely fresh fruit was the defining feature! The locality of the hotel was very good. Despite that fact that the hotel is situated on a busy thoroughfare, it is right next to the Villa Borghese park which was very pleasant to walk around (there are zoological gardens and a museum of modern art for those interested) and we were also at the top of the prestigious street 'Via Vittoria', where the famous 'Cafe de Paris' is situated as well as the amazing 'Harry's Bar', both of which are worth a visit if only for a coffee or glass of wine! The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the Spanish Steps and we got around most of the sights quite easily by foot although there is a Metro station close by. There are some pleasant bars and restaurants (try 'La Bruscheta' for a lovely meal/atmosphere/friendly staff) locally if you don't fancy going further afield! All in all, I was delighted by the hotel. The only reason I'm not awarding it 5 stars is because I feel quite strongly that the bar prices are ridiculously extortionate! HALF a pint of beer is 7.5 Euros (which at the moment is over \u00a37!!) and a coffee/diet coke is around 5 euros!! We didn't eat in the restaurant but heard reports that it was extortionate! Out and about in Rome, the cheapest pints we came across were in the off the beaten track bars at around 5 euros, but many city centre bars and restaurants are charging 7 or 8 euros!! Be prepared for an eye-opener when eating and drinking out!! One last comment! If you are visiting Rome for future welsh rugby international games, NH Vittorio Veneto is a good one to go for because many of the big names stay there! We saw Gareth Edwards, Phil Bennett and the radio presenter Roy Noble in the lifts/at breakfast!!", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "canada", "Title": "\u201cWonderful terrace\u201d", "Author": "flamingokate", "ReviewID": "UR10045661", "Content": "We had stayed at the Jolly V V in 1993 and found it to be very clean, nicely decorated, fresh, well-located and good value (included VAT and buffet breakfast).

The bathroom was perfectly adequate, and came complete with a decent length bath - as opposed to merely a shower. Everything was spotlessly clean. Breakfast - served in the slightly 70s feeling ground floor restaurant - was included in the price. This consisted of a buffet, with a choice of the usual ham, salami, cheese etc, bacon and eggs, and a range of other goodies. Enough to stock up for the day if need be. The service was perfectly pleasant and efficient. We also used the hotel's car to the airport - slightly more than the fixed price taxi fare (although arguably this does not apply since the hotel is just outside the walls of Rome) but a whole lot pleasanter. The location of the hotel is superb - if you like this end of Rome, that is. It is a short walk to the Spanish Steps and the Via Veneto (a stone's throw from Harry's Bar), just opposite the entrance to the Borghese Gardens, and pretty close to the best (in my view) collection in Rome, namely the Villa Borghese.

Our stay there was booked by the cruise line. When we read reviews on the hotel, we were a little concerned about what to expect as most reviews we read seemed to be average at best. However, all four in our party agreed that the hotel was decent and clean and not as bad as some of the reviews we read. As regular travelers, we want reasonable and decent accomodations at a reasonable price. We geverally don't book top quality accomodations as we spend little time at the hotel and only use it as a base during our trips. The documents provided to us lists it as a 4 star hotel which in the US means upscale. In Europe, it means average as I would say it was comparable to any large chain mid scale hotel in the United States that would cost between $70-$100 per night depending on location (obviously, more money in prime locations). However, the room was clean, decent and equipped with the essentials. It was also very close to the park and local attractions. Even if we were staying longer, it would have met our expectations and we were satisfied with it. Our luggage was lost by the airline.The hotel obviously had no connection to our lost luggage, so they were not willing to offer any help in that department which is fully understandable. I certainly did not expect them to track my luggage, however, when I asked for a phone book to call the airline , any phone numbers they might be aware of or for help with getting an outside line to make calls (which I was charged for), the front desk offered no help and more or less ignored me and point blank said \"not our problem.\" Again, I was not asking them to track it, just help with finding a phone book or numbers since this appears to be a frequent occurence. Numerous others that were in the hotel and on the same cruise experienced lost luggage. In my opinion, the level of customer service in the United States is definitely higher.

The good-sized bathroom has an antique for a hairdryer which smelt smokey when being used. Breakfast is a buffet with a good selection of cereals, breads, croissants, scrambled eggs and juices.

Breakfast was excellent every day--croissants, scrambled eggs, 6 varieties of cereal, fresh fruit, juices, water (gas & non-gas), nutella, butter, bacon, sausage, cold cuts, rolls, bread, toast. There was no fitness center on site. It was in the area & cost 25 euros, so we never utilized it. The bar/lounge was closed during part of our stay due to renovations, but it looked very nice. The hotel's location is great. Take a right out the front door & walk to the park across the street, to shops, restaurants, Spanish Steps, Trevi. The concierege provides guests with a map. We took taxis to the Vatican--well worth it. We walked back one day & it was quite a trek. It certainly seemed farther than 2.5 miles. We're avid walkers, but it was tough in the heat & sun. I recommend taking a hand-held battery-operated fan & an umbrella! The Borghese Park across the street has a permanent hot-air balloon available for rides & there is a zoo, but we weren't able to do either. The museum at the park is supposed to be very nice. We walked through the park many times. We had the hotel pick us up from the airport & bring us there for our return flight. The cost was 50 euros for pick-up & 45 for departure. It was well worth it! The taxi drivers were friendly & we didn't have to carry our luggage. The concierge has a brochure for bus trips outside & within rome. We took a trip to Capri, which was 2 hours away. It was quite enjoyable. We had nice tour guides & met people from all over the world. I recommend sea-bands (available at drug stores in the U.S.) for the boat rides from Naples & to the Blue Grotto. Watch your head going in & out of the grotto! Duck down in the rowboat! In summary, I highly recommend this hotel. It was a little pricey, but worth it for all of the above reasons.
