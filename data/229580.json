Impressions are both with plus and minus. On the bright side: location, price, staff attitude, fair comfort and antique if you like it. I do and that's why I chose this hotel. On the dark side: houskeeping does very basic cleaning, i.e. they change towels and wipe the basin and toilet (?) and make beds. They probably wipe wooden floors as well however have no proof of that in my room. But that's all they do. There were 2 mirrows in my room and one of them was probably cleaned a couple of years ago if ever. The web on the wall above my head was horrible, bde head stead wasn't cleaned for ages (I cleaned it with the wet tissue),2 glass wall bed lights were dusty, the radiator in the bathroom was clean only it its upper half, the lower part wss black instead of white between rails. Jacuzi perhaps hasn't been used for ages and when I tried to switch it on the dirt went out of holes together with horrible smell. The hotel doesn't provide hair conditioner, only hair and body gel and body lotion. They do not replace bottles daily. I also have never seen the hotel that doesn't put a new sop bar daily. Towels are clean but very old. Bathroom is so dark that it's impossible to do make up or style your hair. I think that one of the lights was uot of order. Speaking of the lights the room itself is quite dark but that was ok for me. However if you need to do some work at the desk than it is a problem as there is no table lamp. They don't have blinds but just heavy gardines which looked stylish but if your room is facing the street you have to close curtains almost everytime you are in the room. Bathroom has a glass wall so to dress up or undress in the bathroom is not an option. But you can still watch TV while taking a shower which is a plus. Also there were no batthroom cups even plastic ones. Never seen this before. There were only two small shot glasses for not clear what purpose- not suitable for wine or water anyway. No hook in the bathroom as well and the door is sliding. there is no shelf for your stuff as well, just a bit of space on both side of the basin. Worked for me though. Bedding was clean and the bed and pillows were comfortable but the wool blanket looked like it came directly from barracks or hospital of 50s.Did not look antique at all. There is no hotel guest book, note pad, pen, etc, or any information about the hotel except of the breakfast prices. Did not eat breakfast though. There is no tea/coffee facilities in the room so if you prefer your first cup of tea in bed, bring your own kettle, etc. The front door of the room was in \"antique\" condition and won't close until you have to lift it. Good physical exercise, perhaps. Amonth other positives - My room faced the street but there we no disturbance during the night and I am very light sleeper. The hotel is non smolking but if you must to smoke ask for a room with a balcony or notify the staff but in this case there is an extra charge of 29 eu per night. All staff are French which is so rear nowdays and they speak good English. They are very polite and helpful but I've got the feeling if there is a serious problem you'll not achives much with them. Typical I'm afraid. However they are perfect in calling for a taxi (I didn't wait for more than 5-6 minutes), booking restaurants and sightseeing. As I said before the hotel is decorated in antique style and furnished with real antiques. That is very unusual for a small hotel and makes a very pleasant impression. All in all I had a very nice stay and did not have any complains. If you are visiting Kleber just be aware of their \"minuses\" and bring your own shampoo, soap, kettle, etc. The location is fantastic, the hotel in general is very nice for what you pay for and I am definitely staying there againg should I wish to be in this part of Paris. Hope you will enjoy your stay as I did.

After viewing a few rooms, we choose one on the street side as the view is much nicer and the street is very quiet so there was no traffic noise. The staff were friendly. The only downside was the breakfast. Tinned fruit salad ect. We only had breakfast one day, after that decided to search out nearby bakeries for a fresh croissant, much better!

There's been a programme of renovation and the lift, for example, is now modern and works well. The hotel is situated in a relatively quiet side street, half way between two metro stations and close to bus stops. The Arc de Triomphe and the west end of the Champs-Elysees are nearby, less than ten minutes' walk. In the other direction, it's about a fifteen minute stroll to the banks of the Seine, at which point the Tour Eiffel is just across the river. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. We mostly spoke (slightly rusty) French but they were just as happy to use English. The bedroom wasn't huge, but we didn't feel cramped. Like the rest of the hotel, it was nicely equipped with older and antique furniture. There was a large jacuzzi bath which had somehow been fitted into a fairly small but perfectly adequate bathroom. Although there were some minor signs of wear - scuffed paint here and there, for example - the room was clean. The free wifi worked well. There is an option to have breakfast in the hotel's breakfast room, in the basement, priced (when we stayed) at \u20ac14. We tried it on our first morning and had a good selection of cold meats, fresh and dried fruit, cheeses, boiled eggs, breads, cakes and croissants. However, we wanted to try a different place for breakfast each day and there are several caf\u00e9s nearby. Le Corner Caf\u00e9, on the other side of Avenue Kleber and a little towards the south-west, did a cooked breakfast for about the same price, offering omelettes, scrambled eggs or oeufs au plat, which in this case meant no fewer than four fried eggs. We found other good places just a little farther away. We also enjoyed some very indulgent afternoon patisserie at a little tearoom almost directly across Av. Kleber and a little to the left. We would very happily return to the Kleber.

Right in between 2 Metro stations. Very reasonable walking distance to L'Arc de Triumph, Eiffel & Champs Elysee. A few ok cafes, a few restaurants in little out of the way corners, a corner store, a supermarket and a very good Patisserie nearby but not a bustling centre which was fine as it made for quiet streets at night. We walked to the supermarket to buy water & fruit each night and over to the patisserie for a yummy brecky each morning. The A/C wasn't working but the weather was gorgeous so we got away with leaving the window open at night. The room we were in was smallish but fit a double bd, table, chair & minifridge. The bathroom was clean w/ roomy standup, no tub. Decor was very very pink & old French I suppose...a little worn but comfortable. The whole hotel only has a few floors with 3-4 rms per flr but they have a good elevator. The lobby is quaint with murals on the walls & again old style French furniture. Staff was fluent in English & very tolerant of our French. There were a few little misunderstandings (over borrowing an adapter & ordering a airport shuttle) but nothing very serious. They seemed knowledgeable enough & tolerant of our questions...though they didn't understand that we wanted to go to an open market or where to shop for deals that weren't at the glitzy malls. They had free wifi so we just googled it ourselves anyways & I think got better info. Overall it was alright...not 5 star but you don't pay for that so don't expect it. It was comfortable. Keep in mind that because its near the Arc that its at one end of the Champs Elysee...its quite the day hike to get to the Louvre.

I would recommend this to anyone. You have time to look at the surroundings (with Street view) whilst sat on the sofa instead of lugging luggage from street to street. Anyhow, I knew the hotel was near to the Arc de triomphe and my wife and I took the Air France bus, route 2 from the Airport at Charles de Gaule to Arc de triomphe. Cost was around 19 euros for two with the knowledge that any traffic jams would not see a taxi fare spiraling out of control. A short walk and we were there at the hotel. It was dark when we arrived so once again\u2026check Google maps first. Got stung with a City tax of around 8 euros a night at the hotel. Didn\u2019t expect that one, especially as I thought everything was paid for. Have to admit the pink room took us aback but it was at the top of the hotel and quiet. There was a safe within a lockable wardrobe. Bed was comfy and free internet made the hotel a really nice place to stay for the money. Tried the breakfast one day at 14 euros each. It was typical French cuisine with breads, jams, cereal and coffee. The smell of fresh bread could be smelt each morning around 06:30\u2026what a great way to wake up. Other days was good old Mc D bacon and egg muffin. God Bless America!! Took the stairs from the 6th floor and discovered they were renovating the 2-5 floors. Workers weren\u2019t noisy but started at 8am. We are always awake by then but for those that like a late lie then it would have disturbed them. Our last night had a family with young kids in the room next door. Baby wouldn\u2019t stop crying, evening and in the middle of the night. My request for a quiet room obviously not valid for the final evening. Spent our final day at Galleries Lafayette. One can pick up the 22 bus just around the corner from the hotel and it drops you off at the Opera (next to the Shopping). All for 3 euros for two persons. Google maps again revealed the Riossy bus was but 20m away and 18 euros had us on the bus directly back to the airport.

Location wise, the hotel is definitely on a great spot right between the Arch de Triomphe and Eiffel Tower. Nearby bistros were a tad touristy by nature. We enjoyed our meals nonetheless. The metro was extremely easy to use and because of the summer holidays, there were no crowds. A very relaxing time of the year to go to Paris.

Before booking this hotel I had not looked at the reviews on here (as I usual do) as I was being guided by price and specifically proximity to the Arc de Triomphe for the marathon start line. So coming on here this morning and seeing all the negative reviews I was very surprised! Now I always take very negative and completely glowing reviews with a pince of salt as people tend to get very emotional about their experiences rather than being objective. But the number of negative reviews does tend to suggest something is up...however I have to say we had a perfectly nice experience at this charming hotel. The reception is beautifully presented and the manager went out of his way to make our stay as pleasant as possible and took care of a number of special requests based on the nature of our visit. Yes the lift is small, but so what? It works and it gets you to the right floor, there's no need to get too upset about this unless you are transporting an elephant to your room. Our room was very modern and a lot more spacious than other central hotels in Paris. The plasma tv was excellent, the bed comfortable and the jacuzzi bath a huge hit! Yes there is a see-through mirror between the bedroom and the bathroom but personally I had no problem with that, my wife and I are not one of those toilet-phobe couples! The surrounding area is also fantastic with some superb restuarants, bars and sights to visit. The hotel is about 5 minutes away from the Arc de Triomphe.

What a mistake!!!!! From the outset we had trouble with this hotel. When calling to confirm reservation, we were advised that the online booking agency \"had made a mistake\" and that our room rate would be 259 Euros per night instead of the 89 Euros per night we had pre-paid for the three night stay. IN spite of the fact that the online agent intervened and supposedly \"corrected\" the \"misconception\" when we went to check in we were forcefully reminded that we needed to pay the additional fee(s). When I informed hotel staff that the online agent had spoken with Cristophe (the manager), and presented her with a copy of the agent's e-mail she insisted that she must have a copy for her records. I told her that she could make a copy of mine, but that she could not keep the original. She took a copy and seemed satisfied with this. Secondly, the lift was broken, and they placed us on the 6th floor of the hotel, and informed us that we would have to climb the stairs. This was horrible! Especially with luggage. Every time we wanted to go in or out of the hotel, it was six flights up and down. Furthermore, there was no central heating in the room, only a little portable plug-in radiator that had to be left on continuously in order to keep the room somewhat warm. We were promised a \"city view\" room - the only view was of a square courtyard facing four other apartments/flats through a large glass wall / window that had to have the drapes drawn at all times! You could barely see a slice of sky, never mind nothing at all of the city. Also, there are no electronic locks or keys. We were issued with a very large key on a fob and told that we had to turn the key in before we left the hotel (every time!!!) because they only had one key for each room, and they would not let the keys leave the premises. This was quite disconcerting as it left questions as the security of our personal belongings. Then, after New Years day, they asked us if we wanted to move to a lower floor, as rooms had become available. When I enquired as to whether or not this would be at the quoted price of 89.00 euros as agreed, I was informed that no, the lower rooms were more expensive, and we would - again - have to pay the difference in costs ourselves. Thus, we declined. When it came time to check out on the 3rd (at quarter to seven in the morning!) we were dealt with by Bernard, who informed me that Christophe had left him a note and explicit instructions that WE WERE TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE in the room costs, and that he had no recollection of speaking with anyone from LastMinute.com. When I pointed out the copy of the e-mail you sent, he seemed shocked to see it. I again refused to pay any difference in costs, and offered to settle the bill, only to find that they had charged us for Hot water! There was no kettle in the room, and since we had brought our own teabags we had asked for some hot water to make tea - so they charged us for it! Ridiculous!!!! The lift apparently has been \"out of service\" since the summer of 2008, light fixtures are indeed hanging loose from ceilings and walls, there are previous reports of heating problems on the upper floors and if you are not fluent in French (which thankfully I am) the staff (with the exception of Audree, who is lovely) is indeed quite abrupt with you.

In between the Arc and the Tower. Great cafes and bars within 100metres. Staff: Helpful. Some more than others. I am sure that the management will read this and they will know who is more helpful - they know who they are. Would I stay here again? Absolutely not. They clearly don't want return business and they are taking advantage of one-off tourists. Three points that I would like to make (any Trip Advisor member who has stayed here, please fee free to disagree): 1. Look at the positive reviews, like I have just done and they are all done by people who joined to Trip Advisor and their last visit was on the same day. 2. Also, the majority of the good reviews have everying at \"5 out of 5\". How many hotels on this site get EVERYTHING at the top score???? Take a look at the Top 5 rated hotels in Paris. Even those members who rate a Hotel with a 5, might see that one area should be rated a 4 or 3. But not Kleber, when someone rates a 5, all areas are a 5. 3. Quite a few of those high ratings are supposedly from the USA, and I would say that those travelling from the USA are more likely than others to not put up with anything substandard, but their reviews are positively glowing. I would strongly recommend you ignore anything that is 5 out of 5 aand take more not of the \"balanced\" reviews. BTW, the jacuzzi (spa bath) is only a normal bath with jets in it. Nothing THAT special.", "Date": "April 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cSteer Clear!\u201d", "Author": "FemaleLondon", "ReviewID": "UR7339199", "Content": "Sadly this hotel did not live up to expectation.

He became quite rude and surly after several polite declines to his offers. Even our return at 1am one night did not stop him trying to flog us a few trips, despite our both having been to Paris on several occasions and stating we had our own plans!

But I digress, back to the ROOM. EVALUATION OF ROOM FIRST, Don't be fooled by the grand description of the words \"Executive\" and \"Jacuzzi\" as listed on their website. While there was a tub with jets attached, I would hardly call it a Jacuzzi in the truest sense. Forget bringing your beloved for a romantic bubble bath for two unless you don't mind going one at a time! The bathtub in our room was not very appealing and the jets were coated in grime. Obviously, the houskeeping staff never put in elbow grease, as you can see from the photos (even though they are grainy.) Another completely odd feature of the bathroom was the complete lacking a shower curtain or rail, so when showering, all the water just poured onto the floor, which was mildly disconcerting as the space was not really set out as a wet room... if you weren't careful, you could 'break your neck\" on the shower water, but really, that wouldn't have happened because, the bathroom was so small, you would have knocked yourself out cold on the wash basin on the way down. And how small was the room? Let's say, that if you had ordered a pizza, you would have to climb over the bed to unlock the door and the pizza person would have to sidle into the room sideways like we did upon entry. The door opened directly onto the bed. I did not like this one bit. I kept wanting to turn the bed 90 degrees counter clockwise to give the illusion of more space as that would have been all that there was, an illusion. Noisy Hallways and you could hear the folks who were staying for a conference getting ready for their meetings at 5:30 am as they clomped in high heels or wingtips, it was so loud and echo-y that I thought in my sleepened haze, that I had left our door open. Nevermind, I could have just nudged it with my elbow to shut it while still in bed. The balcony, ok, well, the big window with some space outside of it, led to a view of a claustrophobic inner courtyard that could be described as a tube or funnel like effect. It was particularly useful for checking the weather as you could look up and see a A4 sized sky to gauge the day by.... useful. THE POSITIVES: Uh, internet access, we think, we could never discover where this was hiding as there was no information in your room to guide you to area interests or features of the hotel. The biggest biggest plus was the proximity to the Champs and the relative price. I think you could do better though. THE STAFF Nice enough but they did not stand out at all as caring or interested in the fact that you chose them over anybody else. As a matter of fact, those who worked in the boulangeries, were much friendlier and I only had to pay them the price of a baguette for a smile and a bonjour! SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD Very very close to all the tourist spots but with some breathing room from the hustle and bustle. Also within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower. The photo I took was a view between streets two blocks away. A five minute walk and you are there at the famous landmark itself. As this was a honeymoon stay, i was quite disappointed. I have stayed in every type of hotel, resort, b&b and youth hostel so I think I know a little about what a facility should offer from penny pinching to pretension. This place slightly masquerades itself as something more than what it really is. I would deem it perfect for s a business traveler or traveler on a two day stint. Anymore than two days NOT recommended. Would I stay again? Only if i saw and personally chose the room before checking in, and then only if i hadn't the time to explore other options. BTW skip the overpriced breakfast.

Most of the staff are friendly, except one man who was particularly unhelpful when we asked for advice on a good restaurant.

We also chose it specifically for its proximity to the Champs Elysee as we were running the Paris marathon on Sunday, 9th April and it was also running a special winter offer price for a room with jacuzzi, ideal for relaxing after the marathon. We checked in on Friday night, 7th April and given the key to a room with no jacuzzi. We asked at reception what the problem was. The man there was unhelpful and seemed to find it funny that we hadn't got what we asked for and told us to see the hotel manager next morning. He also said that we could use the suite for an extra 50\u20ac per night and we refused. Next day, the manager was unavailable, we were told to go back in the afternoon when it would be sorted. We arrived back to be told that there was a room with jacuzzi for us in their sister hotel. So we traipsed with suitcases a 15 min walk to this hotel and checked in. We then got a phone call from the manager to say we couldn't stay in this room unless we paid an extra 50\u20ac per night. We refused and said we needed to go out and would he sort this for when we got back. We returned and it was 6pm on Saturday by this time, the manager still refused to give us this room unless we coughed up the extra money. In the meantime he said he'd booked us into another hotel which wasn't convenient for us as it involved 2 tube stops away from the marathon start. We refused this again and said we would camp in reception unless he sorted something out for us. At that moment, there just happened to be a police car outside and he asked us to step outside and speak to them. We refused so he spoke to them himself and after a lengthy conversation asked me to explain in French what had happened. They took our passports in the meantime so we really had to do what they said or we wouldn't have got them back. In the end we were bundled into a taxi to the other hotel in the Opera district which was very basic and obviously a lot cheaper than the Kleber Hotel which we had booked originally. It was clean and comfortable but not ideal for a marathon weekend. We have made complaints in writing to both hotels and to the Paris tourist board. On returning home we have found that the Hotel Kleber have deducted our bank account with 144\u20ac and 200\u20ac. We have no idea what these amounts are for and they were instructed in writing not to debit our account, so they have breached this. We will be taking this matter further.
