My only complaint would be the restaurant. We never even went in after seeing the menu prices. Appetizers were priced over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13 and entrees over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25.

The restaurant had a very nice buffet breakfast which was included in the price and included eggs (in multiple ways) and other hot items including bacon, baked beans, hash browns, grilled tomatoes, pancakes etc, plus a lovely assortment of pastries, fruit, breads, spreads, cereals and Juices.

This makes travel into Amsterdam or out to the Airport really easy. The rooms are standard Holiday Inn, although the 'Corner' rooms (6 and 17) are larger and there was a safe in the one I had. The bathroom is a good size and the shower works well. The beds are large and reasonably comfortable. Breakfast in the Vermont Restaurant is a standard Holiday Inn buffet offering Continental and UK/US style cooked food. As a business hotel this ticks most of the boxes. Now we come to the title of this review. Please bear in mind this is a 3/4 star hotel charging accordingly. The toiletries are attached to the wall. The hotel does not provide a facecloth and has removed mine on occasion (return was promised but did not happen). There is a minibar of the 'touch it and pay' variety but no fridge. The mugs provided with the kettle are cup sized, not mug sized. TV reception is poor the image has interference. The reception staff are with one notable exception courteous without being friendly and at checkout have never enquired if I enjoyed my stay. I write this review as a Platinum priority Club member who has used this hotel on several occasions. My benefits here extend to a bottle of water and a glass! My 'guaranteed upgrade' means the water is in the room before I arrive thus making it 'an upgraded 'business room'. I know these are all little things but for me they create an overall impression that this hotel does not care and is mean spirited. People will stay here because it is convenient, and most are on Business.

Being quite late booking, I was unable to find a reasonable priced central hotel, that could guarantee a 'proper' bed for my daughter who was accompanying us. Having experience of the Holiday Inn group, I was pleased that their hotel was a good price, but concerned about the apparent distance from the centre. Not a problem as it turned out as it is Idealy located near a transport 'hub' with Metro, tram and bus all available a short walk away. 15 Min journey and you are in Central station. Less if you visit the museum quarter! Reception were friendly and efficient. The room was pleasant and had 2 large beds, so my daughter slept well! Bathroom was clean and a reasonable size. Despite being a Platinum Card holder I wasn't offered an upgrade, but the room was quite sufficient for our needs, even as we were staying a full week. The safe was spacious, the TV had english language channels. We didn't sample the Minibar, but it was well stocked. Food was fine. A generous breakfast each morning. We didn't eat at the hotel as the restaurant was closed (I presume for the new year?) but bar food was available. The bar itself was also nice, friendly staff and not (too) expensive. New year itself was.. well.. Different? Thanks are owed to the reception and bar staff who all warned us that the public transport stopped at 8pm, so to be sure we were where we wanted to be. Thanks to the warning we were well placed to catch a free, if somewhat 'europop cheesy' concert with a fantastic firework display in the field behind the Van Gogh museum. Then things got interesting! The Dutch dont seem to understand the concept that fireworks go UP, not ALONG. Everyone, and I do mean everyone is throwing fireworks about. It was honestly like being in a war zone. As we had our daughter on tow, we weren't aiming for a late night, so hunted down a taxi, and had the most 'exciting' taxi run home I've ever had. Burning debris on the road, swerving round exploding fireworks. Surreal! Big advantage of the Holiday Inn was it was far enough out to be quiet though, as the fireworks continued for hours! We however were quickly fast asleep. I'm sure no one in a central hotel could say the same! We had been unable to buy a transport pass that crossed the new year (for some reason they all expire on the 31st) but again the hotel came to out rescue as the Porter can sell transport passes at very competative prices. Our week was over again too fast. We saved on expensive Left luggage costs at Central Station as the Porter kindly stored our bags without cost, and were able to catch a train to Schipol direct from the adjoining Rail Station.

The tram ride is 15-20 minutes to the center and after a day or two, its not very convenient. Its fun to experience the outer neighborhoods of Amsterdam - but to a point. There are absolutely no restaurants or nice areas to hang out or walk in the near vicinity, so you are rather trapped here. The furniture, bedding, bathrooms are all dated. The temperature control in the rooms is poor - you may have to call to have them open up the sealed windows for you. The internet charges are RIDICULOUS. No wifi except in lobby and you even pay for that! The desk staff was overwhelmed the whole time I was there, with lines forming each day. They were nice enough, but it got tiring. There are no specific amenities to speak of - the little restaurant was always packed - because you don't have anywhere else to get food - and the food is edible, but for what you pay, not good.

This is not a 4 star hotel. Full Stop. This rating is in error. I would not even call this a business hotel. It's a 2-3 star tourist hotel without pool, room service, or other expected amenities. As an advertised 2-3 star or tourist hotel it would be passable. Rooms are not bad, they are reasonably clean as is most of the hotel. There were some stains on our wallpaper and small amounts of mildew in the bathroom. Tourist class: acceptable; Four star: not. I had a problem with the safe and someone came and fixed it in minutes. My experiences with the day staff were good, and the housekeeper for my room was great with my dog and was embarrassed by my offered tips. We ate a couple of meals at the \"Vermont\" Bar and Restaurant. The lunch / dinner food was good as was the service. The maritime decor conflicted with the list of Vermont towns listed over the bar. When I think Middlebury, I don't think of a lighthouse. Breakfast was tourist class. The Croissants were low-end as were the hot items. They served pancakes with breakfast, but no maple syrup was provided (This is Vermont!) I had reserved two rooms on the hotel web site for the \"All in Business Package\". The package includes room, wireless internet, breakfast, and 10% discount at the Bar/Restaurant\". The evening and night staff however were unfamiliar with the packages sold by the hotel, undertrained in hostel standards of behavior and overall amateur. I checked in around 7:00 PM. It was quick. My reservation was there at the agreed rate. The clerk was not impolite, but seemed to be going through motions. Glaringly missing was any two way conversation or even the typical script telling me about breakfast, internet, parking... No offer was made to assist with my luggage. Nor was any mention made of the package I purchased. I even commented that I was surprised there were not internet codes with the keys. The clerk made no comment. Internet: When I called to ask for codes I was told I would have to pay; and that there was no wireless on my floor. I was also told that I was wrong (yes, wrong) that there was no included internet and that I could in fact not have a voucher. I asked to talk to the manager. I was told \"no\". I walked downstairs. I asked for the manager. I got a blank stare. I asked again. I was told the manager wasn;t there. Finally I was told I could talk to the Duty Manager after his dinner. Duty manager tells me there is absolutely no free internet. So, I make an offer: I show you my reservation details and if I'm correct you comp me a room. If I'm incorrect I pay. He calls me aggressive and inappropriate. He counter offers: \"If you are correct (as in If you can prove to me) that your package gives you this then I will give it to you\" I pay 29 bucks for internet, pull my reservation and go back to the desk. I wait another 15 minutes for the Duty Manager to return. I ask a desk clerk if she can have a drink send/brought to me while I wait. She says \"No\". I finally show my reservation to the Duty Manager. He then tells me they \"found\" my reservation in their system and yes, I get free internet. I ask about breakfast. I am told yes its also included just give my room number. I drop the wireless part of the discussion. For the remainder of the stay I am not greeted or serviced by any of the evening shift I expected a parking fee of around 25EUR. To my surprise, parking was free if you were able to get a spot in their small lot. Paid parking was right next door and I only had to resort to it one night. What pains me is that the night staff could not explain the parking rule(s). They just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. When I receive my bill before checkout, I find hundreds of Euros in internet charges, no 10% discount for the meals, and I was double charged for the dog. (15 Euros per night was their advertised rate. The day clerk found the error, not me.) At checkout, the day clerk fixed everything quickly and politely. If I had been on a business trip I would have checked out immediately after arrival. So here is the bottom line: The hotel is not 4 star. I think that large portions of the staff are under-trained and that there exists a lack of process and procedure that ensures that guests receive the proper services, amenities and attention. This is a management issue. About me: I am a 30+ week a year business traveler. This was however a personal trip and I am not usually a Holiday Inn customer. Would I stay here again?

Getting to the hotel was easy from Schiphol airport. Take the train to RAI station (about 10 minutes), and walk out of station and turn right, the second building on the right. Be careful because you can miss it, and because you are approaching the back of the building, so the lobby entrance is on the other side; but its just before the Novotel. When we checked in, I asked the person checking us in, who was also the \"Duty Manager\" for the train or trolley info to get to the city center. He acted like I was bothering him and that he had other important things to do. We were puzzled because there was no other guests in sight. The lobby was empty except for the other staff. I said \"Sir, I am asking you for help to get to the city center. Please give me a minute!\" I asked him relevant questions like what time does the last trolley come in, if it is running on New Years Eve and New Years Day, etc. After he hurriedly answered my question about the times for the trolley, he proceeded to say \"Good Day, Madam\". I was shocked and insulted that he could just dismiss me like that, after just checking in, surrounded by our luggage. But it gets worse. A couple of days passed, my husband checked on his credit card, because thats what he does since we have used it so often the last couple of days, he noticed that there was a $700 authorization hold on our card from Holiday Inn. This is crazy because at check in, the Duty Manager asked us for our credit card for any damages and extra services we might incur during our stay. My husband advised him that we had already paid for our stay in full thru Priceline. He said he still requires it. My husband asked how much hold will he putting. He said $70. You could imagine our frustration and anger when we found that the duty manager had in fact charged $700! I hope none of you have to deal with this man. My husband has already put a call into Holiday Inn about him. it took Holiday Inn another couple of days to clear this mess up. Good thing we had other funds, because this could have put a huge damper on our vacation. All in all, even though the hotel is not central, in fact 30 mins away from central Amsterdam, it was still very convenient. It is just less than a block away from the #4 trolley that takes you all the way into the heart of Amsterdam (about 25-30 mins); and about 10 mintues by train to Schiphol Airport. You can also walk to a really great japanese steakhouse from the hotel. Kushi Tei of Tokyo. Walk up north passed RAI center. Its about 15 mins walk. Not bad walk when the trolley wasnt in service during new years eve. My only two complaints is the Duty Manager, and the clogged sink. The shower pressure was very good, but then the tub clogged sometimes too. Like the other reviewers before me, I too, thought the residue after it finally drained out was gross. yuck. Also, there is no locked safe. Which sucked because we had to carry our passports with us the whole time. And we didnt trust to leave it in our room. I have one advice: If you are going to the museums, try to buy the tickets and print out before going, you will thank me when you see the line of people wrapped around the block!

If you have stayed in other holiday inns you know what to expect. The biggest downside is the location - it's about 3 or 4 miles south of the city centre in the 'convention district', but it's easy to get from the city centre in about half an hour either by tram (number 3 stops right outside the hotel) or by metro from the city cente, or you could walk in about an hour. The other downside is that this hotel tries to gouge extra cash out of you at every step - in particular: (i) late check-out attracts massive fines (something like \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30/hour!!), (ii) there isa parking charge of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac22 a day, which for an out-of-centre place with a large park seems a bit mean (iii) breakfast was poor value at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 a day per person, and (iv) no free internet although every other hotel in amsterdam I've stayed at offers this feature.

I was booked in for a week in July, and fell victim to their so called \"summer schedule\" - something which was not advertised to us at the time of booking, or checking in. I watched the hotel amenities disappear day by day during my week. On Sunday we were told that the restaurant was closed for the summer - but there was a limited (and adequate) menu available in the bar. On the Monday, this menu had been cut back to a handful of items - most barely edible - the lowlight being pre-cooked hamburgers. Luckily I was able to eat outside the hotel for a few nights, but when back on Thursday, there was no food at all available. And then on Friday, my mini-bar was mysteriously emptied, so no drink or snacks available in the room either. I have stayed in hotels with no food service before and often I prefer to eat outside the hotel. But when I am travelling for business - often coming and going at odd hours - and staying in an area with no other food options at night - any hotel I am staying in has to offer some food options, and certainly shouldn't cut them off with no warning. Other issues - inadequate room cleaning - dirty glasses and trash left in the room, used items not replaced.. No toiletries available in the room. Ice machines available on alternate floors, but nothing to collect the ice in. And if you want anything after about 10pm, good luck - I found that no-one answered any of the phones. And then finally - the hotel questionnaires which were displayed prominently in my room on Sunday were mysteriously removed later in the week.

The lobby looks nice, the staff is multi-langual and friendly, and there's concierge for your luggage. From the outside, the building just looks a big block, but it's confusing that the main entrance is from the west, and there's a side-entrance that closes for the night, coming from the north. The concierge was nice, telling that there's an Albert Heijn supermarket in a mall close to the hotel, if you drive De Boelelaan west to the next stoplight, and then just right again on the next stoplight. It's a 2 minute drive, and the Albert Heijn (whose operator Ahold also own all the Stop&Shops in the US, BTW) is open until 10 p.m. ROOM: The room is of decent size, nice features (flat screen TV), looks nice, is clean. It's confusing though, there's no menu for the restaurant laying around, part of the restaurant's menu is inbuilt into the TV menu system. I would have preferred a printed menu. There's a mini bar (4,50 Euro for a 0,33 can of coke). The windows of the room do not open. The AC took a whole while until getting the hotel room warm on these freezing cold November days. The thing that I did not like was that the sink in the bathroom was clogged. Like the water did not go away. Stood there for hours until it was gone. Looked quite yucky. This did not apply for the shower. Showers nice, the usual difficulty to adjust water temperature though. Two milimeters can be the difference between burning hot, and freezing cold. EXTRAS EXPENSIVE: Parking is 25 Euro for 24h, and breakfast is 20 Euro per person. WiFi only available in the lobby, starting at 5 Euro for 15 minutes. Cable internet only in the rooms, available for 22 Euro for 24h. Paid movies are part of a 25 Euro for 24h Entertainment flatrate, except for music albums, which are 3 Euro for 24h of use. In the weekends, there's free street parking available right next to the hotel. LOCATION: This hotel is right on the corner of De Boelelaan and Europaboulevard (don't let yourself be fooled by the mark in Google Maps, it's in the wrong place), and it's not central, but ca. 7km away from Amsterdam's main station (Amsterdam Centraal), though I bidded on the Amsterdam center zone at Priceline. It's right next to the Europaboulevard exit of the A10 though, so access is easy. The hotel itself actually is close to the RAI convention center, probably it's good for that (only 5 mins walk). The tram line number 4 starts right in front of the hotel, taking you to the town center. It takes 30 minutes though, until it arrives at Amsterdam Centraal, so if you wanna go to the main station, the Metro line 51 may be your better choice, though it's more expensive, as it only takes 14 minutes to the main station, and the ride is way less shaky and much more comfortable. The metro also runs every 10 minutes, just like the tram... BOTTOM LINE: It's a very good, clean hotel, for 75$ a night on Priceline.

RAI Station is also in a very short distance and from there it is possible to go to Schiphol Airport and several other locations. No complaints at all!", "Date": "February 27, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn Amsterdam", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d229480-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$169 - $352*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">De Boelelaan 2</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1083 HJ</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "229480", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/68/86/688662c20eb9e5be53d3acaf130d950e1large.jpg"}}
