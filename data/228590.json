Hotel bar is a bit empty & bar staff did charge random prices although we didn't question it, just didn't go again. The room was fine with space but only a view of the interior structure. The power went off once but probably not their fault. Club opposite was a problem to some guests but not us. Chucking out time at 9am! Paris bar just down the road excellent with good 'grub'.

Rooms are very small (we were upgraded to a 'big' room and even that was tiny) and although some staff members are very friendly, some hardly say hello. With regards to the comments that most rooms look out on a lift shaft, do ask for an upgrade as that is relatively cheap. You'll get a room facing the street then for which you really should bring your earplugs as it's, as said before, right in between a couple of nightclubs.

You can access several Metro lines at that station. It is also right around the corner from the Diagonal street so buses are also easy to catch. A fixed taxi pickup stop is right across the street if you need one quickly. And there are many small restaurants of all types within 1-5 minutes of the hotel. Shopping is also right around the corner and up and down the Diagonal if you so desire. Rooms - we were on the 4th floor and were simple and clean. Bathrooms appear to have been modernized recently with modern showers, sinks and fixtures. Our room faced the street and there was the occasional loud and happy drunk returning from tapas and beer at 3 am announcing to the world that he was enjoying himself or the regular (daily?)municipal trash pickup at 5 am. I chalked this up big city living. otherwise I actually preferred this room to be able to watch the daily street scene of folks going to work and people heading to bars and restaurants in the evening. I couldn't fugure out how to use the room safe on my own and wasn't sure whether there was a key that was needed. The rooms were heated and never cold (outside temps 32-45f) but did get a bit hot and stuffy when returning from the days activities. Opening the window for a few minutes fixed that quickly. Staff - They were extremely helpful and nice. We received restaurant recommendations, directions to museums, assistance with the wifi (free in lobby area) and suggestions of good tours to take. They made copies of a few documents without fuss or complaint. Amenities - The breakfast buffet was decent and average (the coffee was always lukewarm) but enough to get your day started and not complaint worthy. Croissants, bread with tomato spread (typical Barca' dish) juice and coldcuts and cheeses. Service was pleasant and never rude. Free wifi in lobby was nice but reception was a little difficult if you wanted to use Skype. Since it was winter we didn't use the outdoor areas of the hotel.

Hotel is nice and cool with a quirky, modern yet charming feel to it. Our room was big and very clean with all important powerful air con...however the window opened out to a tiny dingy \"courtyard\" so we had no natural light whatsoever and kept curtains closed the whole time. Had to go outside or to terrace to see what the weather was like! Also there were some sort of refurbishment works going on directly above or next to our room which was extremely annoying - drilling and banging from about 10am - 5pm, couldnt nap at all during the day. I assume we were just unlucky though as refurb works are obviously temporary so I wouldnt let this put me off going here again. Terrace area is a lovely feature however could benefit from more sunbeds as it does surprisingly get quite busy. Very nice place to relax after a long day of sight seeing and although small the pool does its job at cooling you down. There is no bar up there but a seating area with ashtrays so you can bring whatever drinks or snacks of your own with you. Hotel staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast was also to a good standard, not sure how much it would cost as it was included in our room price, but if you can I suggest getting it included as its a nice start to the day. Typical continental food was on offer in buffet style but they also did a cooked breakfast of eggs, bacon and sausages if you asked which was a bonus. There is a small room with two computers with free internet access which was a handy feature too. In terms of location, the hotel is situated in a nice lively area very close to bars, restaurants and shops - however about 10 mins to a metro stop and a good 25 mins to la ramblas, which isnt the best option when its hot! Very close to the diagonal road and passeig de gracia though which are both fun roads. Overall I would recommend this hotel but should I return to Barcelona I might consider others closer to the beach and La Rambla as its nice to not have to walk or use metro.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHotel Astoria a clean and friendly hotel in a central location\u201d", "Author": "Chorltonwheelies", "ReviewID": "UR114808317", "Content": "Hotel Astoria is a good hotel in a central location to get the best out of a weekend in Barcelona.

We had read a few reviews on here about rooms that had no windows (which I must admit I would not have liked) We read all the other positives however and decided to take the plunge and book it, but to email the hotel and specifically ask for a room with windows. When we arrived we were escorted to the 8th floor and taken to our room that had not one - but two windows! :) The room was larger than we expected for a city hotel and had a decent sized bathroom too. Very comfy beds and nice views of the city. Another plus point was that the rooms have a minibar which we quickly worked out could be emptied onto the side and used it as a fridge! We then replaced all the (over-priced) merchandise and no-one was any the wiser! (Shhhh...!) We didn't eat at the hotel as we thought 15 Euros each was too much to pay for breakfast. There are lots of Spar type shops around though so we just bought croissants and fruit etc. I would have liked tea and coffee making facilities in the room, but perhaps that's just because I'm English I don't know. The pool terrace on the roof is really nice and they don't seem to mind you taking your own alcohol and snacks up there which was great. It is locked at 11pm though. In terms of location, the hotel could be slightly better situated, but you will do so much walking in Barcelona that I don't think it makes much difference. The area is very safe and friendly and it only takes about 20-25 mins to walk to La Rambla and about 10 mins to walk to a Metro stop. The tourist bus is fantastic value and will take you all around the city. You can get on and off wherever you like and the hotel reception sells tickets 2 Euros cheaper than it is on the bus itself. Beware of the price of some of the food though, I walked into a little bakery type shop (it looked for all the world like a Spanish Oddies or Greggs). I bought one slice of french bread pizza that was only luke warm and a can of no-brand orangeade and it came to 9 euros 50. I nearly died. I would also like to say that it is absolute rubbish about all the pickpockets in Barcelona and how unsafe it is. I feel quite angry for Barcelona that it is talked about in such a way. We were on La Rambla every evening and always felt extremely safe. We did not see anyone at all dodgy and noone approached us or tried to steal from us at all.

The sofa was very uncomfortable, not that we wanted to sit there for long anyway. The bed was also too hard with really soft floppy pillows - we had to ask for more as we only had one each, they were so floppy that 2 each wasn't even enough really! We did not eat breakfast there but used the coffee shop on the corner - about 3 euros for coffee and a croissant. We ordered room service twice. Once for drinks to be brought up to the roof terrace in the afternoon (excellent service then). The second time was for coffee one morning, it didn't arrive after 20 minutes so we cancelled it! There is wifi availabe for a fee. However, if you have BT broadband then you can connect via BT openzone which seems to be 'twinned' with the company the hotel use, but obviously make sure you know your username and password for BT openzone.

Astoria hotel has a team of very professional, efficient, well trained, friendly staff resulting to customer satisfaction. This is reflection of a good management. The Hotel Manager, Mr. Pepe Camps, takes his time out to talk to guests and asks if everything is going well, accepts feedback and takes criticism constructively. He also offered assistance in booking a hotel to my next destination (Paris). The fact that the Manager takes time out to approach the guests is indication of professionalism. Mr. Manuel is the best front desk staff there could ever be! I hope all hotel staff in the world is like him. Very good attitude making guests feel welcomed. Some of the things that impressed me a lot and might help future visitors to Barcelona: Location: Perfectly located, safe neighborhood, accessible to almost everywhere \u2013 bus and metro stations in and around the city, to and from the airport, shopping, sightseeing, restaurants, coffee shops \u2013 everything is stone-throw and yet away from the crowd unlike those hotels along main street Front Desk: 1. Wide spacious area, very clean, highly polished floor. 2. Very quiet \u2013 day or night\u2026 Guests checking in and out (which can be chaotic at some hotels) but because the front desk staff manage the guests properly it all went smoothly. 3. Warm welcome, friendly staff \u2013 whether front desk or maintenance people all of them never failed to greet guests with a smile (how can you not have a great day!). One early morning I decided to go for a walk. As I walked to the door I was greeted with smile again and was advised to wait a little while as it was still a bit dark outside, although it\u2019s a perfectly very safe area. 4. Very helpful staff from sightseeing to medical needs\u2026 Especially Manuel who helped me with the instruction how to take the fever medicine \u2013 thank you Manuel. 5. Check in was perfectly smooth, hassle-free, it went very quick and I was headed to my room. Room: 1. The room was not small at all it had a couch and huge cabinet. What impressed me the most is it\u2019s very clean condition! Astoria has very good housekeeping management. There was a minor problem with the heater but that was attended to and resolved immediately within minutes. The friendly staff showed me the other available rooms (all equally in good and clean condition) and finally got the room with a view of the neighborhood, which I really loved because it had a window allowing fresh air and I could see the locals do their morning routine\u2026 2. Very quiet at anytime of the day\u2026 had a restful sleep and it made me recovered from jetlag quickly. If there were some noise it\u2019s because of undisciplined inconsiderate guests being loud and careless moving around the hallway and rooms. It\u2019s not the hotel\u2019s fault. 3. Bathroom (shower and bath) was likewise clean and amenities are replenished in time. The sink had a slight crack but did not post a problem at all. 4. Comfortable bed and pillows! I have a back problem and was concerned that the bed could cause pain, but I had the perfect bed for may back. . Breakfast: 1. Quite a selection of food but the best part is the coffee. There\u2019s a coffee brewer right on the buffet table but the nice lady staff told me she would take it to my table. She actually had a freshly brewed coffee made for me delivered to my table. Nothing better than to start a day with a good coffee and a friendly waitstaff! 2. Table nicely set, spoons and fork are clean (I always check this at restaurants). 3. As I was eating I could see a lady staff clear the table on my right that a couple used. Then a gentleman colleague of hers approached and helped her out. Very good teamwork right there! Staff working harmoniously and efficiently \u2013 again a reflection of good management. By far the best hotel and service by team of professionals.

The gym as mentioned on the hotel website has only 3 stationary bikes. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. 3. The swimming pool on terrace is a pond. They should make it a jacuzzi. Then atleast the romantic couples can make use of it. 4. Buffet breakfast was ok. Not much choice of vegetarians but it was ok. No complaint. 5. The staff at Front desk is very temperamental. It all depends on what mood or how how busy they are. This defines the time they will spend with you on phone in dealing with your issues. 6. I have heard people talk about the grand staircase. It's nice and pretty but one cannot live there so I don't see any point in envisaging the same. The only good thing about the hotel is the location: 2 blocks off Plaza de Catalunya and 1 block off Diagonal and quite close to Segrada Familia.

The hotel lobby was great, and staff are very attentive and greet you daily. I was shown to my room, which looked like it was a late addition to the hotel on the top floor of the hotel. My room had two small windows, which were opague so I could not see outside. On the last day of my stay, I discovered that the skylight in my room, which had a blind on it, actually opened up to allow daylight and fresh air into the room. This was not really a problem though, as I did not really spend much time at the hotel. There is free internet in the hotel which is a plus, and a tiny gym with a couple of stair masters in it. The pool is more like a hottub, but is on the roof with a great view of the city, and ocean. I was able to watch an incredible thunderstorm from here. The restaurant on the ground floor is charming and offers a full European breakfast for an extra fee. It is a buffet, which has lots of great fresh fruits, juices, coffeee, tea, yogurt, breads, daily egg dishes, cheeses and cold cuts. They will also arrange bacon or sausage and eggs for you, which is included in the price. It is a great way to start your day. There are also a number of furniture and clothing stores in the immediate area, asa well as a number of outdoor cafes and restaurants, which is nice. Bars are all over the place so you do not have to venture far from the hotel. One big plus is that the hotel is renovated, which makes it nice and it is in a very quiet area, so I never had any problems sleeping. I would recommend this hotel to other people for either long or short stays. It is very clean, comfortable, and safe. The staff again are great, and very helpful with any questions that you may have. I made my reservation for a single person, thinking I would get a twin bed, but actually got a double bed, which made it a great stay. The closet in my room was ample for a week's worth of clothing.

We came back in October and were in a room in the loft - which was not as nicely laid out as our room in April, but we grew to like it - it had a window we could open (and the fresh air was lovely on a hot weekend) and the views across the roof tops was fascinating. We had breakfast included in April and it was fine, but in October it was not part of the package so we found the most beautiful deli on the Diagnol not far from the hotel - a favourite with the locals that was fantastic.

Breakfast is continental with rolls, fresh fruit, cereals, ham, croissants etc but perfectly acceptable. There is a bar/ italian restaurant 2 min walk away which we often would just come back & sit with a glass of wine outside. There is also free wi fi at the hotel. We did check out the pool upstairs.

When we arrived, we did have to wait a couple of hours for our room to be ready since we requested a Queen (and check in doesn't officially begin till 3PM), but the front desk staff was personable and friendly, and we walked around the district (seemed mainly for business) while we waited. I do want to say that even though this hotel is situated in the business district of L'Eixample, you are just only a few blocks from the Diagonal metro stop (L3 and L5 lines), which you can take just two stops to Las Ramblas (a major tourist attraction in Barcelona), Park Guell (a beautiful wide open park adorned with man-made caves and fascsinating sculptures), La Sagrada Familia, and many more! It was such an ideal central location for us to have since this was our first visit to the city and we wanted to see a little bit of everything. We had no problem getting around and this was key. We opted out of the hotel's daily breakfast and decided to explore the area each morning for a new place to grab a bite before we went exploring. This was probably one of our favorite things to do while we were there since there was a good number of cheap/affordable restaurants and mini tapas bars to choose from. I recommend BoPan for a cheap (but yummy) breakfast/lunch. Our room was kept impeccably clean. And there was an AC, which was great since it was VERY hot while we were there. There was also a mini pool available but we didn't use it. It's barely waist deep. And a fitness room with three bikes. We didn't take a laptop with us, but apparently wireless connections were available in each room. Still, I found that going down to the computer room to use the public computer sufficed since I was on vacation after all. Their ammenities weren't their strongest point, but since we went to Barcelona to explore and learn the lay of the land, hanging out in the hotel wasn't very high on our priority. All in all, the staff was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The location was PERFECT.

When we checked in we were offered breakfast for 6 Euros per person per day, as opposed to the 13 Euros we were quoted on the website, it was a special offer but we decided not to go for it as we wanted to check out some of the local patisseries. We booked a superior room which we found out meant we had two floors with a spiral staircase, a TV upstairs and downstairs, mini-bar upstairs, bed downstairs and a sort of enclosed terrace/sun room off the downstairs. Cleanliness was good, wasn't particularly looking for dirt but certainly didn't notice any. Rooms were services daily, clean sheets, towels, etc... The only negative thing I would say is that we had one of the rooms that wasn't included in a recent renovation, which meant the air conditioning units were pretty old, i.e.: noisy. We had the air con on throughout the first night and couldn't get any decent shut-eye. So the second night we took the risk of being too warm and switched off the air con through the night which worked out fine. One other thing is the pool, we didn't generally use the roof area (sunbathing etc...) as we were there for sightseeing but we did notice the pool was really small - I'd say it would be crowded with 2 people in it.

Basically it is like a room without a window, so very confusing when alarm goes off to wake you up as the room is pitch black despite it being morning. On 2nd night asked to change, and they said they would move us in morning. Which they did. Were moved to room looking on to street - 225, much better although had to sacrafice our double for 2 singles but it was a good price to pay for daylight! Also reception offered to print out our boarding pass on their printer when we asked where nearest internet cafe was, so this was helpful.

Even if you build in the ten euro taxi fares to get downtown & back it is still an option if you are in Barcelona to see the sights.", "Date": "February 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Israel", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended it to anyone visitng Barcelona!\u201d", "Author": "SWM2008", "ReviewID": "UR12372954", "Content": "Initially when we arrived, we were given a small room, but upon our request the staff moved us to a much larger, clean and spacious room facing the street (with funky, black and white tiles).

My fianc\u00e9e and I booked fairly late so checked at the hotels available on Trip Advisor and decided to go with the Astoria. The entrance is very nice and we were greeted by a friendly manager. Having read the reviews on here we had asked for a room on the higher floors with an outside view (as opposed to some windows that apparently open into an airshaft). Unfortunately they had none available until the following day but we were told that we were more than welcome to move after our first night. The room we were put in was nice enough but there was some mould on the ceiling above the shower (no extractor fan in the bathroom), and as we discovered the following morning, it was right above the kitchen so was quite noisy. Not massive problems but we decided we would ask to see the other room the following morning, which was higher, quieter and nicer, so we simply moved our stuff across. So, good hotel, and the location is pretty decent as well. It is about a 20-25 minute walk from Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya and the top of La Rambla. However, the walk is a pleasant one, either along Rambla de Catalunya with its cafes, or Passeig de Gracia (one of the main shopping streets). We walked most places but there is a metro stop near by (Barcelona metro was very good- cheap, clean, air conditioned etc.). Breakfast at The Astoria was \u20ac12 which we had a couple of days. The choice was great - cereal, fruit, ham, cheese, yoghurt, croissants, pastries and even chocolate brownies, all washed down with orange juice, tea and coffee. If you only want a light bite though, you may be better off with a pastry from one of the coffee shops nearby. Overall, good hotel and good location and we would recommend this hotel to people traveling to Barcelona.", "Date": "November 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham UK", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay...\u201d", "Author": "James-Bear", "ReviewID": "UR5885352", "Content": "My partner and I have just returned from a mid week city break in Barcelona and i just felt that i should comment on the great accomodation we had whilst there...We arrived from the airport quite late in the evening and were greeted by friendly staff who wasted no time in checking us in and whisking our bags up to the room so we could get out into the city asap.The rooms were spacious by european standards with comfy beds and i have to say that some of the comments made by my american friends about the rooms being small are probably true in comparison to the many hotels i have stayed in during my visits to the US.However this hotel exudes an air of a much higher class hotel than the 3stars it declares.Maid service was outstanding with fluffy towels left every morning and complimentary toiletries,the breakfast choice was also very good with a range to suit most pallettes and served at a reasonable time 7am-11am so even late risers can get a hearty meal before getting into the sightseeing swing of things.Never used the restaurant in the evening so cannot comment on this but the lounge area is a perfect area to chill with an espresso after a hard days walking and the roof patio area with its sun loungers and small pool is great for relaxing also.Overall loved the hotel and will not hesitate to book straight away when we return to barcelona which we will as we loved it!! Also as a small note the hotel is only 2blocks from Gaudis apartment La Pedera and the Bus touristique buses which criss cross the city and are an absolute must for any visiting the city without a car is only a short 5/10min walk away.Place de Catalunya is about a 20minute walk but with so many street cafes to stop at and enjoy the atmosphere it doesnt really matter..Happy travelling!!!", "Date": "September 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Monica, CA", "Title": "\u201cGood value, loved the location\u201d", "Author": "reedner", "ReviewID": "UR5356140", "Content": "Most of the reviews are dead on. Great showers, towels. We loved the location away from the riff-raff, but if you really like to be in the heart of the touristy areas it's not for you. The one thing we had an isuue with was the staff at the front desk. The service was fine, in fact we had some small problems with our room -- no big deal -- that was attended to and fixed quickly. But I wouldn't say they were the friendliest staff. We came down to the front desk a few times to get information, even to check out and get a taxi and were'nt even acknowledged. Not exactly attentive or warm & fuzzy.
