There's a Metro just across the road and Nou Camp is an easy walk away, as is the Placa D'Espanya and the National Museum of Art. Getting to the hotel foyer is via an inconspicuous doorway outside and at the front of the station, and the lifts are less than impressive, but the foyer itself is big and airy, if a bit soulless. A few palms wouldn't go amiss. The rooms have recently been refurbished, and whilst on the small side (at least the basic Orbital room was anyway) are attractive, comfortable and quiet, with nicely designed lighting. The shower tended to fluctuate between hot and cold in a random sort of way. The restaurant is closed Sat and Sun, but when it's open during the week the food is excellent, as is the service. Bar food and service is equally good, with a satisfyingly wide range of spirits available, but check the prices of them before you order. A major negative for me was breakfast. It's the usual buffet type with all the cold stuff around the perimeter and the hot dishes on a central island, but it's quite obvious that the chef cooks a batch of food and then goes back to bed, for when a dish empties, it isn't replaced/refilled.

Believe me, i'm not a huge confident person but taking the jump (and managing it!) really did me the world of good and once you do it, you'll never look back! The Barcelo Sants, where i stayed, simply added to all of that. Price was excellent through expedia / flight with monarch but the service was fantastic - a big king size bed all to myself, rooms were large and well equipped and maintenance of rooms couldnt be faulted. I know there are quite a few bad reviews but since Barcelo started renovating the hotel you cant fault it really. Bathroom lovely with free toiletries, nice clean fluffy towels, large TV on the wall, nice big wardrobe and safe. Ideal location for someone who doesnt really want to get taxis everywhere (and wants to be a little out of the centre) - metro, train etc is all easy to get as the hotel is above the main train station and its literally a 10 minute journey into town on the extremely efficient metro. The lady at check in even showed me which metro to get and advised me on the different lines / tickets which really helped. The only real let down was the gym - firstly its not free to residents of the hotel and not air conditionned and the machines are archaic / from the dark ages and i personally found it quite chauvanistic (its a very mans mans gym if you know what i mean!). HOtel aside, Barcelona is an amazing place - so much culture and so much to see and even though i was only there 2 nights, i fitted in so much (and espanya is only a short walk from the hotel at night which has a lovely big shopping centre and is a real hub of activity). Admittedly there arent many toilets (that was a big of a problem as alot of the cafes say striictly for customers) but the market has one for 40 cents and El Cortes WC is hidden in the corner of the top floor.

You cannot miss this piece of granite on top of the railway station Sants. Surrounded by some construction sites its not very appealing but the location beats it. Its just a stroll away from Rambla, the yacht harbor and the exhibition center with their shopping mall (converted from an old arena) next to it. The hotel itself leaves a quite standard impression from the outside and even the lobby is not too outside of the box. A carpet - which you probably would see in many other 90s built hotels - with chairs from a 70s space movie on it is already a bit edgy. But once you enter the lift (and leave it on your floor) you know that you are in a very different hotel. decorated like a journey to different planets, also inside the rooms, is certainly a VERY interesting experience. They even kept the story going with some welcome cards on the bed (lifting off from .... arriving on moon.... etc.). Pay attention to the wording on the bubbles hanging on the wall (bedroom and toilet). Did put a smile on my face. Unusual but very practicable: an open bathroom. It certainly did add space to the whole setup. Windows are huge (top to bottom is glass, no frames) with electric blinds coming from the ceiling and closing completely. Make sure you leave them closed if you have a room facing south. For some strange reason the air condition goes off once in a while and if you don't switch them on again it can become a bit sauna-style in the room. Wasn't only my problem. I saw a couple of other guests facing exactly the same issue. With some of them the AC didn't work at all. Not very pleasant when you come during summer time. Oh yes - you cannot open the window. Selection of TV channels is ok but with quite a dominance of Spanish channels. You get the impression that they uploaded every local Spanish channel they could find on the network. Selection of international channels is a bit limited. To say upfront - no pool.... I saw another hotel next to the exhibition center and the arena with a fantastic roof top swimming pool (if you are into swimming in Barcelona ... :-)) Internet (wireless) works very fast. Next morning breakfast was not opulent but absolutely sufficient. Nice bread and rolls, toast, cheese & ham (different kinds), yoghurt (you need to be fast to grab a plain one... otherwise you are left with the sugar infused options), cereal, coffee as much as you can absorb, juices (not fresh but not tooooo sweet as well)... enough to not leave hungry. Oh, one more point - parking. Before you consider to park somewhere in the narrow streets around Sants: forget that. Next morning your car is either towed or you will have to pay a hefty fine. Park on the nice sundeck of the hotel (there is a ramp leading to the upper platform where the hotel entrance is). benefit: you don't have to walk far to the car and its parked pretty safe. Downside: in the morning you will open the door to an oven... literally... the parking platform opens to the southwest and has full sunshine all day long. You do the math what happens in your car. Take out all CDs, otherwise you will have a couple of nice (expensive) coasters... Check out (as well as in) is fast, professional and a bit on the not-too-much-smiling-edge. Unfortunately.

I chose it because of the convenience of taking public transport, both from the airport and once in Barcelona. That was all as expected (metro was extremely convenient and easy to use, taxis right on the doorstep, rooms quiet, breakfast buffet not bad), but the negatives very much outweighed the positives. We started out in a family suite with air conditioning that did not work. The hotel knew the rooms were hot because when we asked to move perhaps to another similar \"suite\", they said all the family rooms were uncomfortably hot. They were also not proper beds for the kids. If all the family rooms are hot, why not tell us that in the beginning instead of forcing us to request a move to another two rooms? They did slightly discount the cost of the two rooms, but I would have rather started in a cool room. They then informed us about the breakfast buffet and told us a price 50% greater than what they had confirmed by email and the same 50% above the prices they were advertising in their lifts! When I pointed that out, the reception wanted to argue with me about it. When we actually went to the breakfast the bill they wanted me to sign also had the higher price. It sorted itself when we checked out, but only because I refused to pay the higher price. Again, if I hadn't raised the issue they would have happily charged me more. I think the hotel is a good bit less expensive than hotels in town, but be warned that if you want to eat out or even get takeaway you will need to walk at least 20 minutes, take the metro or a taxi. There are plenty of taxis there, but if you are too tired to go out one night you have little choice but McDonalds in the train station. If the location suits you then perhaps consider the Torre Catalunya, which is only about 100m away and I seem to recall rates pretty high with Tripadvisor travellers.", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galway, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cHas good number of disadvantages, think twice\u201d", "Author": "Shekamu", "ReviewID": "UR69137125", "Content": "I stayed at the Barcelo Sants for three nights with my spouse and a small baby. We booked this hotel as my husband attended a conference in the same hotel. Our first impression on seeing the room was that it was very old and depressing. I guess coming from Dubai, we expect European hotels to be a bit dated but this hotel is in desperate need of refurbishment, at least of the carpets. The taps in the bathrooms are a bit stiff when opening and closing and you have to adjust the hot and cold taps (they don't have one tap for both). The shower had bursts of very hot water for no reason which made me afraid of sudden changes in temperature. The bed was very big, and the bathroom had a hairdryer and toothbrush kit, but there was no kettle, and when I asked for boiled water to make baby's milk I was told I should come down to the service floor myself to pick it up or else pay a EUR 3 charge. I said I'd pay the charge anyway, but then they didn't charge me as it was for the baby (only nice thing from service). There is no iron in the room and although they said they provide an iron on request, I was told it's for free only after 5 pm and I have to use their laundry service if I wanted to iron in the morning. The cost for ironing a blouse is EUR 9. On Sundays, they charge double for the ironing (EUR 18). I've never stayed in even a 3 star hotel that doesn't provide irons! I ended up hanging a shirt in the bathroom to get the shower steam to straighten it. They said that they have free Wi-Fi but there was no signal in the rooms. I could only get a connection standing halfway outside the room door in the corridor. You have to pay to use the computers at the business centre. The lifts that take you to the station from the hotel are ridiculously small and dirty. Very claustrophobic.The location is good if you plan on using the metro/trains, but for our type of trip with a baby stroller etc, we preferred taxis and you can get those easily at the station just below the hotel, but it would've been more suitable for us to move to a hotel located in the main shopping boulevard instead of paying taxi fare (varies between EUR 7 - 15), and we did move the last night to the much better Majestic Hotel on Passeig de Gracia. Not only was it very similar in price, but it is rated as 5 star, we were welcomed by a smiling doorman everytime (Barcelo don't open doors for you), got a much more spacious room, far nicer bathrooms and their bellboy carried our heavy suitcases all the way to the door of our train at the nearby train station! They gave us a baby bottle warmer with a cot with bumpers and all. Huge difference! Barcelo Sants may have been a 4 star when it opened, but at the moment I'd say it's a 3 star bordering on 2.5. They are lacking in their facilities, service and interior quality and have outrageous money-squeezing tactics.

We ended up paying 100 euro/night for two nights and had free wireless internet, a safe, a fantastic breakfast for two and a late checkout for 3pm (all of which is not normally included at the base rate and all of which we used -- the late checkout was perfect for us.) If you want to just hang out at the beach, I wouldn't stay here though. It is a great hub for touring the city, but not going to the beach. We bought a two day pass on the Bus Turistica (27 euro p/p) and used this for our primary means of transportation around the city, while taking in many of the sites. Because there is a stop right outside the hotel (and main train station), it was very convenient. We had to ride the same routes a couple of times to get back to our hotel, but that was fine as it gave us a repeat of the great information provided on this bus. The location of the hotel couldn't be better. Above and beyond the tourist hop-on/hop-off bus (which is 1000 times better than the ones in Rome), the hotel is located right on top of the Metro subway system and the main train station. If you are traveling by train, don't bother going anywhere else. We had prebooked another hotel for our last night in Barcelona and it was also fairly close to the train station, but it was a 5 star and completely over-priced with little value to the money spent. I will write a review about them, too, as I wasn't impressed with the Melia Barcelona. The little things are important in this hotel. The abundance of toiletries provided, the fantastic breakfast, etc. Some things that may irritate you though are: The front desk seems to have an attitude problem. The guy who checked us in from Venezuela was great -- he gave us a map and some suggestions while being friendly and helpful. The rest of the crew behind that desk, seemed to hate people. Fortunately, once you're checked in, there should be little interaction with them. The other thing that may irritate is the fact that the non-smoking floors smell like smoke. I read that in another review, although it is tolerable and we are very sensitive to that sort of thing. We noticed it, but it wasn't a big deal. At 100 euros, you can't expect much in Europe, so this turned out to be the best value for the money in over 7 cities that we visited this trip. By far, the best value.

We stayed at several hotels throughout Spain, and when we ask for a 3 person room, we don't expect a wheel-in bed crammed into an already extremely small room!! Two double beds would have been great, but no, they had 2 single beds and a roll-away. I don't think so! We didn't even have room to open our luggage! Everyone's comments about the dreary state of the rooms are spot-on. The bathroom door looked like it was painted with mildew, the beds were painful, Wi-fi was spotty at best, and the parking was very expensive. So anyway, I grab our key and go upstairs to get a sandwich for my daughter and I - that was cool they were open until 1 in the morning. 6.5 euros for a tuna sandwich the cheapest item, I try to remember our room number so I can charge it to our room. The guy tries all these numbers and I'm seeing everyone's names in all these rooms -- \"no that's not me\". So, I pay cash. I knew where the room was from the elevator. I put the key in it seems to fit but the bolt is locked. I call my wife and some man answers groggily. \"Oh sorry, wrong room!\" It must be the room next door... I try the key, and it fits and opens. The lights are already off? \"Honey?\" I turn on the lights, and a young lady I don't know sits up in her bed staring at me in obvious fright! \"Whoa! Sorry! Wrong room!!\" I rushed off for the elevator. How did that happen?! Perhaps these stupid plastic keys can open multiple rooms in the hotel?? I was dumb founded! Needless to say, I was going to have a word with the front desk! \"This key seems to open more than just our room....\" \"My master key!!\" This poor excuse for a hotel clerk was obviously overwhelmed when we came in at midnight. He was alone at the front desk and there was no one to help with luggage. He knew we weren't going to be happy about our room and he wasn't even sure he had a roll-away available. He was generally nervous and rushed up with us to the room to check on this extra bed. In the process, he accidentally left his master key with us. Who knows how often this happens, but this time I was just unlucky enough to leave my room forgetting which floor our room was on.

Overall, the place was OK, but only because I was able to book it at a very favorable price. The good thing about the hotel is that it sits atop the central train station.

This makes it a convenient hop or two to wherever you want to go along Barcelona's extensive and well-serviced Metro lines. The double-decker tourist buses also stop right outside, and there is a reasonable assortment of eating establishments in the area. Placa D'Espanya at the base of Montjuic is two stops or a 15-20 minute walk away. The smallish room was disapointing. It had a depressing, faded green decor. The mattresses on the twin beds were hard, thin and fairly uncomfortable. The bathroom was cramped. The tub had cracked tile, mildew and an extremely slow drain. If you wanted to use the in-room safe, they charged 4 EUR per night to activate it. On the plus side, wireless internet was free if you had your own computer with you.

As stated, the hotel is directly about the Central Train station with Metro links but as all the tracks are underground, you wouldn't have known it ..... we couldn't/didn't hear a thing. We got the train from the Airport (5 euros each) into the station, walked outside, up a short walkway, into the lift which took us straight into the Hotel reception. From the outside, this hotel looks like an office block but inside is modern, relaxing and clean. Check in was quick, efficient and easy - the reception staff are lovely, very helpful and charming. Room was OK - nothing special but clean, the aircon was very efficient (we had to turn it off at one point as we were too cold in 90+ degree heat!) and the bed comfortable. Power shower was great once we worked out how to switch it on! We didn't eat at the hotel except for breakfast which was very good. Good choice of fruit, juice, baked goods, cereal, meat, cheese and hot buffet. J doesn't eat meat but didn't struggle at all to find something he could eat. A previous reviewer said he felt rushed as the staff cleared his table whilst he was still eating but although the same happened to us (we were a group of 4), its just their way. Yes, dirty plates, cutlery and napkins were cleared when we were still at the table but in our case were replaced with clean cutlery and napkins straightaway. On our first morning, we lingered in the restaurant for about 50 minutes and didn't feel under any pressure to hurry up and leave. The only blip during our stay in this hotel was the Cocktail Bar. After Friday night out in Barcelona, we returned to the hotel around midnight and thought we would have a night cap. Deciding to be decadent, we all opted for a cocktail. However, the menu is in Spanish and some of the ingredients we just couldn't work out. The Bar guy was less than helpful - we asked for his recommendation and help in translating and he just glared at us and shrugged his shoulders. So we ordered hoping for the best, sat at a table and waited and waited and waited. He took 30 minutes to make 4 cocktails - a Tom Collins, Manhattan, Margarita and a non- alcoholic fruit cocktail. 3 were very pleasant but the Margarita was awful. There was way too much salt on the rim of the glass (I had to wipe it off) and instead of a teaspoon of castor sugar in the bottom of the glass, he put salt instead making it undrinkable. It was like drinking a glass of sea water. Did we complain? Well, no but in our defence he wasn't the most approachable of people, it was 12.45am and we were tired having been up for 18+ hours and quite frankly we couldn't be bothered - just put it down to experience. Check out on Sunday morning was quick and easy - having pre-paid for our trip and having no additions to our bill it took all of 30 seconds! Overall a pleasant stay. OK its not right in the centre of all the action but the transport links are so good - rail and metro under the hotel, taxi rank right outside and the open top tourist bus stop just across the road - its a fantastic location for getting in, out and around the City.", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood location, good service\u201d", "Author": "DebHK", "ReviewID": "UR17348366", "Content": "We stayed 7 days at the hotel for a conference.

We chose this hotel for the last night of our trip through Southern Spain and Northern France because it was adjacent to the car rental return, where we needed to drop off our car before flying out early the following morning. We figured it would be convenient to both returning the car and getting a cab to the airport. Both were true. However, I had forgotten from being there in the 90's as a backpacker how seedy the area is. In general, train stations in Europe can be infused with seedy scammers looking to pick-pocket, etc., and the train station in Barcelona is not really any exception. Even the employees at the car rental (Hertz) were a little obviously paranoid about someone coming into their business if they didn't have a reservation. HOWEVER, this hotel upstairs from the station was actually very nice. We returned a day early from our driving and they accommodated us with an extra night prior to our reservation. It is more upscale than the average hotel, the food was decent, although not very \"authentic\" to Spanish food, it was of good quality. The people were friendly, speak English very well, and the rooms were truly sound-proof as described. Where it lacks in charm, it makes up for in cleanliness and \"modern\" accommodations. I generally prefer the quaint, smaller, homier hotels, but this fulfilled our need, which was a convenient place to sleep between car return and flight. Since we came back a day early, we did some sightseeing again on our extra day in the city, and nothing is really close by to see on foot, but you can get a subway train or a taxi very easily. Just hang on to your bags, your kids, and anything else valuable and keep your peripheral vision acute until you get out of the immediate area of the train station. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for a long-term stay, as we found a much more quaint hotel in the heart of the Jewish Quarter for our initial 3 nights stay in Barcelona where we could walk to sites, markets, restaurants, and the Rambla, but if you are renting a car or taking a train out of town, or if you want something more \"American\" and modern, this hotel does just fine.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location\u201d", "Author": "studyabroadhoya", "ReviewID": "UR10870501", "Content": "The Barcelo Sants hotel has one of the most ideal locations for travel throughout the city and perhaps farther.

This entrance closes however at 12pm and the only other way in we saw was up some steep metal stairs which looked like they'd be a nightmare if you'd had a few cavas in town. The Bus Touristic also stops right outside on it's blue line which was handy, although the bus was packed every time it came past and we couldn't always get on the first one that came. This bus also only runs until 8pm, when it changes into a nighttime tour that you have to pay again for. The room was OK - spacious and with a great view of the city, but it just seemed to be really dated, I think the choice of green for all the wood etc was a bad one. The bed was absolutely massive, and a welcome relief from the tiny campbed we had been on in our selfcatering apartment. The bathroom however was about the same quality as in our apartment - cracked tiles, missing sealant around the bath, 30 year old rusty taps. Really disappointing. We decided to have breakfast in the hotel and that was also pretty disappointing. A reasonable selection but they could have done so much more. A lot of the things they listed on the breakfast advert in the room weren't actually available, like milkshakes which were specified as being a feature (cue one disappointed husband!!). If you do stay here also check out the vending machines on the reception floor by the gym - bottled water is 55 cents here rather than the 2.50 the minibar charges, and it stocks icecreams too.

Easy to get on the metro, rent a car, or catch a train, but--and this is a big \"but\"--their staff was extremely rude and arrogant, and doesn't know the first thing about customer service. I remembered choosing between this hotel, and the hotel expo on hotels, and choosing this one because it has a fitness center (use not included in room rate), and because they offered a free breakfast(or at least I thought they did). Upon check in, I asked the deskperson if the room rate included breakfast. He said \"yes\", and that there was a buffet-style breakfast each day, and that the cost was 2 euros. Free?...2E?...whatever, \"close enough\", I thought. Next morning, we come downstairs hungry, and the woman behind the register at the buffet asks for 25 euros for breakfast! I tell her that our room was supposed to include the buffet for a special price of 2E. She responds that there's no 2E breakfast and that there's absolutely nothing she can do. I remain calm and ask who I can talk to about it. She points me to the front desk. I go to the front desk and speak with another gentleman (the arrogant one), explaining the situation. He says the same thing as the woman at the buffet. I explain that I remember vividly, choosing this hotel because they had a special deal including breakfast. He says \"estas equivocado\"...you're wrong. Through all of this being told that I'm mistaken and that there's nothing they can do, I remained very calm and polite. And finally, I tell him that \"in the future, you all should check to make sure that your webpage is updated and accurate.\" He says to me, \"there's no problem with the webpage.\" To which I respond, \"I distinctly remember seeing free breakfast on the webpage.\" And he says (with nose high in the air), \"no es posible\"...that's impossible. The most upsetting part of all this was not the fact that we didn't get what we thought we were getting when we made the reservation, but the fact that they were not willing to consider--for even a moment--that THEY could be wrong. And on top of that, we're talking about a buffet here. They're gonna cook the food anyway, either it gets eaten or gets thrown away. Either they could get 4E from us, and we would eat some of the food they would be throwing away, and leave satisfied customers....Or they could insist that I was wrong, do nothing, throw away the food, get no money, and get a bad review for their rude service...which they have now gotten.

I was disappointed to learn that since December of 2005, the formerly direct train from the Barcelona airport to the in-hotel station is under repair. Yes, you can still take the train. But it involves leaving from the airport, going a stop or two away, unloading all your luggage, going down a set of stairs and then up another set of stairs and getting on another train. No escalator available. While it's obviously cheaper than a taxi, I certainly don't recommend it. There are also buses available which leave from the airport train station (go across the overhead pedestrian bridge from the airport to the train station, pass the ticket booth and go out the front doors)to the Sants station, a better option for the budget-minded traveler, than the train. While it was definitely nice to have the metro actually inside the building, it didn't seem to make up for the depressing look and feel of the hotel. It has all the charm of an over-tired Holiday Inn. The desk staff are polite, helpful and speak quite enough English to more than adequately handle any situation. And my room was cleaned well, each day. So, zero problem with service. It's just the drab surroundings of a hotel in desperate need of a makeover which really didn't help. That and not being able to walk outside and have anything I really wanted to see, nearby. Next time, I plan to stay somewhere in the Eixemple district. Preferably near the Grand Via metro station. I more than capable of walking a block or two to the metro. And it's worth a couple cab rides to and from the airport, to me, to stay in an area boasting excellent restaurants, and all the other things I'll enjoy. I would have been much happier. As it is, you walk the equivalent of probably a few blocks to go from the Barcelo Sants Hotel lobby down to the green line metro stop in the building. So you aren't saving a lot of steps, unless you plan to ride the blue line, exclusively. And to echo what others have said, watch your belongings in the Sants station.

The hotel restaurant is extremely overpriced, so don't eat there. There are many other good restaurants located in the area, especially on or near Calle Vallespir. Services are overpriced as well, such as phone calls and laundry services. There is a laundromat at 136 Vallespir and a supermarket across the street. Personally, I'd recommend staying somewhere closer to Las Ramblas or Plaza Catalunya. There is a major metro station there and lots of shops and sites nearby. One local I spoke to said the area in which the Barcelo Hotel is located is kind of dangerous at night. The staff can be quite rude as well. This is a business hotel, and I'm sure all the desk staff can speak Castilian as well as Catalan because both are taught in Spanish schools. Yet when I arrived, the two girls at the desk refused to speak to me in Castilian.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Concord, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3639837", "Content": "May 2005.

The hotel is above the Sants station and is absoutely fantastic for its location! The train goes straight from the airport to the station and within few minutes, you can be sitting in your hotel room without the fuss of wandering around a new city looking for streets that don't exist on your tourist guide. A word of warning though, the lift that takes you from the station to the hotel above closes at midnight so if you come back to the hotel via metro later than midnight it does mean a walk up the entrance for cars, a steep ramp uphill with no walkway for pedestrians. However I recommend that you can get taxis as they are extremely cheap (about 4-7 Euros depending on where you are) and easy to catch anywhere around Barcelona. The people that moan about it not being near the action must have been in another hotel as the Metro was so accessible (being just below the hotel!) and as I said, taxis were very good value for money. The soundproofing does work as we could not hear the noise from the station. The air con was fantastic and kept us cool during the gorgeously hot weather! I agree with other people that the rooms need updating as our safe and fridge wasn't working but the staff are wonderful and gave us a new room straight away. The room is a good enough size with a nice bathroom and a lovely view of Barcelona. If you're looking for luxury, this hotel is not it but the hotel is terrific for people who truly want to sightsee Barcelona as it is in a fantastic location, it is clean and the beds are comfy! A night time visit to Cafe Zurich is essential (at the end of the Las Ramblas, Catalunya station), perfect for people watching. The food and drink prices around Barcelona are fantastic. The Hard Rock Cafe is fantastic for anyone wanting a good old juicy burger. All in all, I had a wonderful stay and Barcelo Hotel Sants is the perfect hotel for sightseeing!", "Date": "July 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Brunswick, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery good location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3342466", "Content": "We stayed at the Barcelo Sants for 4 nights in March 2005 and found the hotel to live up to our expectations.

The rooms are decorated in a sort of \"Hotel '80s\" style, but are clean and spacious. The lobby is a desert - the bar is open in the evenings, but there is absolutely no atmosphere, so don't bother. Room service and mini bar are expensive - my advice is to buy snacks and beer from the supermarket across the road! TV is OK - there are channels in 4 languages. Location is as others have said - as it's not in the centre and a little pricey, the weekend tourists tend to miss it, so it's reasonably quiet. The beds are very hard, though! The station links to everywhere in Spain - we went to Girona for a day, and it was cheap and quick. As others have mentioned, the breakfast is 12 Euros, so the station is a better bet, but do understand that we are talking station cafeterias here - not fancy eating, by any means! However, we got fresh orange juice, coffee and croissant for around 4 Euro per person. The biggest problem is the price of \"extras\". Wi-Fi costs 5 Euros for an hour or 12 Euros for 24 hours BUT everytime we asked for a 24 hour card they had mysteriously \"run out\". The safe costs around 4 Euros a day - extraordinary! However, the bathroom extras are fun - I brought back two combs, a shaving kit and a spare toothbrush! The staff speak English, but the service is standard Spanish (as far as I can work out). Let's just say that the concept of \"customer service\" and/or \"service with a smile\" has not reached most of Spain yet, and this hotel is no exception. In summary, this hotel is good for a shortish break, but more than 7 nights would get tedious, I think", "Date": "April 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cNot bad at all!\u201d", "Author": "virginbride", "ReviewID": "UR3289238", "Content": "Stayed at Barcelo Sants For 3 nights for a well needed girlie weekend.Hotel location was brilliant, being just above train station, rooms were clean & comfortable,reception staff were helpful & efficient (pointed us in direction of ice machine & provided iron & board.)The tour bus stops right outside the station which is handy & u must have breakfast in restaurants within the station much cheaper than the hotel & excellent variety.oh yes,the lift from the station closes at midnight so take a taxi back to the hotel after your night out & it will eject you right to the hotel door.
