After reading about several hotels in Rome and all the reviews about Colonna Palace Hotel, we chose this one for its location, and absolutely did not regret it! We booked 4 rooms, three doubles and one triple. The rooms were clean and of decent size. The beds were firm and comfortable and relatively large in size compared to the average European hotel bed; I just wished I brought my own pillow; the hotel's were quite thin! The remodeled bathrooms were clean and the shower was excellent - the water felt like a pwerful cascade on your body! What surprised me and impressed me the most is the fact that they changed the bed sheets daily! All the reviews on this hotel mentioned about the beautiful view from the breakfast terrace - and it is absolutely true! The view is amazing and the quality of the continental breakfast is pretty good. They provide regular coffee, but if you would like a more gourmet one, like a capuccino, all you need to do is ask for it. :-) This hotel is centrally located, and we easily walked to the Spanish steps (10 minutes), Trevi Fountain (4 minutes), Navona Plaza (10 min.) and Colosseum (20 min. max). Less than 2 short blocks away, there are many restaurants and outdoor cafes to choose from. We tried a different one every day. The one restaurant I do NOT recommend is Antica Trattoia da Pietro al Pantheon dal 1842. They charged us 13.50 euro for bread and olive oil/vinegar (1.50 euro per person)! I know bread is not free like in the USA; to charge per basket is undertandable, but, to charge per person is what I found to be outrageous! They gave us only 2 small baskets and not all bread was consumed. I didn't make a big stink at the restaurant but wanted to make sure to mention about this in this review to warn potential \"victims.\" Regarding maps, there's no need to purchase one before going to Rome. The hotel can give you a complimentary one which is very detailed. Would I stay in this hotel again? Yes!

Rome was our first stop on our 'eleven nights in Europe' tour. After our nights in Rome, we planned to go to Positano, Italy for four nights and then we were to fly to Barcelona for a conference for five nights. We always knew that we were going to be tired and time poor for our two nights in Rome. Following the Rome visit, we had booked a train to go to Naples and then a driver and a guide to visit Pompeii for three hours on our way to Positano (a great plan that was expensive but it worked exceptionally well). I had found it difficult to decide upon a hotel in Rome, as there were many to chose from. I consulted our cit holidays booklet from our Flight Centre travel agent in Melbourne and with that in hand, trawled the trip advisor reviews. In the end, we chose Hotel Colonna Palace and we loved the position and proximity to the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish steps, the restaurants, the Pantheon, and the hotel was just close enough to walk to the Colosseum too. It was also opposite the Lower House of the Italian Parliament, Palazzo Montecitorio. We had booked a Superior room, and our room that we were taken to was quite spacious, charming and lovely with its traditional Italian decor and high moulded ceilings. There was a lot of natural light in the room. The bathroom was large enough and it had a great design and fit out, and the entry into the room was separate which I liked. The only issue was getting used to the idea that the peaceful protesters would be camping outside all night below our hotel window. When we arrived mid afternoon, I tried closing the window properly to shut out some noise from the megaphone outside, but the window wouldn't shut properly (I have been since told that many a hotel windows often do not). I don't think that closing the window properly would have made much of a difference to the noise anyway. As I was feeling tired and irrational, I asked for a room change. The staff were very helpful and showed us to a similar room above it that would take an hour to clean. My husband insisted that we stay in our original room, until he discovered that the safe wouldn't work. We thought that in Rome, this was essential, so then we both agreed to change rooms. By this time, we went to the second room, where I found that the bed made an awful noise even when you sat on it, so after much time wasting and heated emotions, we made a plea to the hotel staff to return to our original room, as another staff member had by then volunteered to us that they could replace the battery in the safe in our original room so that it would probably work! With the safe working, and the window not quite shutting properly, we were happy and settled in our original room. We had exhaustion, jet lag, and ear plugs, but we knew we would be comfortable and sleep for the night. We were ready to explore Rome! Following our room change incident, the staff at reception remained friendly and extremely helpful with maps and a restaurant recommendation. They bore no grudges against us! We were back on track, just a little bit later in the day that we wanted to be. That same afternoon, we managed to do lots of walking to the Colosseum via the Trevi Fountain. Prior to our departure I had booked a tour of the Colosseum (no monies paid at this stage), but as we were late, we missed this but we did manage to skip the queue and we did an audio guided tour for a short while. We ate later and returned to the hotel to sleep, and we slept right through the night, the noise outside our room was not an issue. The rooftop breakfast was one of the highlights in this hotel, and the setting was perfect. During our breakfast, we learned from a couple of young American ladies staying in the hotel that one of their wallets had been stolen out of their handbag the day before whilst in a restaurant (not the hotel's restaurant). It was stolen by a group of well dressed, probably professional thieves sitting on a table, for a short amount of time, behind them. By the time the ladies had managed to alert the bank, about $3,000 worth of goods had already been purchased! The message to us there was to take a bag that could be easily sat on the lap throughout meal service. The food on offer at the rooftop breakfast was mostly good, except it was lacking in that there was no fresh fruit platter, and that the hot water for teas and coffee were never quite, really hot. Other than that, there was plenty of other selection and we were happy. Our second night in the hotel was spent with a different group of protesters outside our window. They were a quieter group than the night before and surprisingly again, they didn't bother us either! What did bother us was another guest banging so loudly on the door of the room next door, that we woke up with such a fright I thought there was a fire in the hotel. Having that happen was annoying, but that could happen in any hotel around the world. In summary, our stay at the Colonna Palace Hotel in Rome was fun (although sometimes it didn't feel exactly like that because we were tired) and quirky in some parts, but that added to the overall experience. I would recommend the hotel because of its central location and its roof top breakfast dining room, and in particular because the staff were very patient with us when we were weary travellers and we had our room change issue. They really tried hard to help and they didn't give up on us, and when you are travelling that is the attitude you want and you very much appreciate it when it is given.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cIncredible Location\u201d", "Author": "RWaters333", "ReviewID": "UR112117998", "Content": "Last visit to Rome, we stayed near the Railway station, too far from everything except Tour buses.

Breakfast was great, more than enough options to please most tastes, and a wonderful view of the city from the rooftop garden. I e-mailed in advance of our arrival to arrange transportation from the airport and was helped by a lovely young woman, Sara Pedone, we had the pleasure of meeting her on our second day there. She was a pleasure, very friendly, polite and extremely helpful, thank you Sara for everything. As to the no restaurants nearby we had no trouble finding many wonderful places to eat, most do open late, so you may have to adjust your eating habits. One bit of advice most streets do not go straight through, lots of turns, so bring a compass and a good map, our GPS did not work well on the narrow roads.

The shower was appreciated. The first room was quite warm and to cool it off we needed to crack the window open at night.

I still haven't been able to figure out where they were delivering. You should definetely request a room facing the square. It was much quieter. When I explained the problem, they were able to accomodate me. Note that the rooms facing the square are smaller on the square side, so if you have more than 2 in a room, you will be crowded. The service by the front desk was excellent, the breakfasts were all you can eat and included meat, cheese and eggs along with the normal breakfast fare. We were there during a February cold snap so did not eat on the rooftop, but we did visit there and take photographs. It would have been lovely had it been warmer. The location is ideal. We were able to walk to all the major destinations including the Vatican. The Trevi fountain and Parthenon were 5 minutes away by foot. The only bus we took was to the Roman Forum and Colisseum. A major bus terminal was located about 2 blocks away. Make sure you ask for directions to the 'Gilloteri'. Very close to the hotel and some of the best ice cream I ever had.

The hotel is warm and welcoming with a lovely lobby area, nice to enjoy a late night drink. Our room was on the 4th floor, but not a problem, because there are 2 elevators. I asked for a front room with a view of the parliament buildings (we were given a side room, but still with a good view). I was hoping to see some political action from my window. The most I saw was TV crews waiting in the square - apparently also hoping for some action. Our room was adequate, with a big double bed, lovely crisp white sheets, big flat pillows (which were not so comfortable), we managed to sleep very well. There was a flat screen TV, but we could not find a single channel in English. There is a minibar, also the usual toiletries (shampoo, etc) in the bathroom. The cherry on the top is the breakfast room on the top floor which opens onto a terrace with a wooden deck and small pool, filled with potted plants and flowers, and an exclusive view of Rome.

You have wonderful view of Rome over the rooftops of all of the buildings. After sight-seeing during in the morning, it was wonderful to simply cool off in the whirlpool. After the first two nights I found that the best place for dinner was this rooftop terrace. Get a pizza or pasta from a restaurant, buy a bottle of wine a supermarket and then you have all of the ingredients for a romantic sunset dinner. The sun set right next to St. Peter\u2019s Cathedral. The rooms itself were a bit mixed bag. The bathrooms had been recently remodeled, but the rooms itself need to be updated. Some of the rooms are terribly small. I think the rooms in the back of the building have more space. I was first in a corner with a nice view of Piazza Montecitorio, but there was little space to walk around the bed. The second room we stayed was very spacious. Now my hotel experience would have been wonderful except for one problem. The air conditioning did not function correctly in my room. It was stuck at the lowest setting. This is a problem when the temperatures are above 30\u00b0C. Normally I would not be too mad, but the management had already known about the problem with the room and did not bother to put us in another room to begin with. Now I would recommend staying in this hotel if one the air conditioning works properly and you get a more spacious room in the back of the building.

It is in the square with the Parliament & Government Building. Lots of security there so felt very safe. We got a large room (larger than most European rooms) with a view of the square & the buildings mentioned above. There was a large bed...really 2 beds pushed together with a round glass-topped table on each side. There were 2 barrel-type chairs, a desk & chair, TV & a mini bar (the prices of beer & wine (3.50 E ea) were pretty reasonable)...there were several small drawers for our clothes. The AC worked fine. As you entered the room there was a large wooden Armoire for our hanging clothes, an in-room safe & 2 pairs of slippers. The bathroom was a good size & the towels nice & thick. They provide small bars of soap, shampoo, bath gel, shower caps, shoe sponge, a sewing kit, a hair dryer & plenty of hot water. The common areas of the hotel are furnished with period pieces & there is a small bar & sitting areas. The highlight of this hotel is the Roof Garden with a whirlpool & a fantastic view of the city. That is where we had the included buffet breakfast. As soon as we sat down we were approached & asked what we wanted....coffee, tea, hot chocolate or cappuccino. On the floor below there were more tables & the food & juices...scrambled & hard boiled eggs, various cold cuts...ham, salami, turkey, cheese & hard rolls. There were also pastry, cake slices & fruit. More was available too. This hotel is a short walk from the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, The Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona, Via Condotti with its many beautiful shops & Via Veneto. We walked everywhere from this hotel. Villa Borghese & gardens, Vatican City, Castel Sant'Angelo, Vittorio Emmanuel Monument, the Jewish Ghetto & many beautiful Squares & churches. There are many restaurants & places to just have a drink, people watch & to listen to the various street entertainers. The downside: The beds were hard, the pillows flat & there was only a bottom sheet & top sheet...no blanket...we had to use the bed spread when we got cold. The price for American's is high because of the exchange rate...not the hotel's fault! If you want to go to the Sistine Chapel or Galleria Borghese I strongly recommend you order your tickets online well before your trip. There is a beautiful church near the hotel...Church of Sant'Ignazio Di Loyola in Piazza S. Ignazio. Also near the hotel is Osteria da Mario Restorante in Piazza Delle Coppelle. I am sure despite a few negatives that you will be satisfied with this beautiful hotel.

The buffet was quite substantial, with cereals, croissants, fruit, eggs and bacon. The hotel was quite tall so it looked over the roofs of many of the other buildings. There is a large building opposite the hotel in the piazza that was manned by security 24 hours a day, so we felt safe wandering around late a night.

The staff spoke English well and were very helpful and polite. The room was quite large (especially by Italian standards) with a HUGE, deluxe bathroom. Everything appears to be newly renovated. It is within a 10 minute walk to a ton of sights: Piazza Navona, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, etc. It is not close at all to a Metro, which is the one downside of the location, but you can pick up a bus within a short 5 min (or less) walk, which takes you to the metro in less than 10min. Our room came equipped with a safe. And last but not least, was the fabulous breakfast included in the room price that was served every morning on a beautiful rooftop terrace (they have an indoor eating spot as well). I have a few complaints, the largest being that the rooms have a lot of street noise. The majority of rooms overlook a busy cobblestone street where vehicles drive fast and people talk loudly, and it all echoes right up the wall. I had earplugs in while I slept and still heard the traffic quite clearly, so keeping the windows open at night was out of the question. If we had been on the other side of the hotel, though, there was construction noise (we never figured out from what) that woke my husband at 1:30am (?!). On top of all that, the walls are pretty thin, so you can definitely hear the neighbor's toilet flushing and TV quite clearly. My second complaint would be the comfort of the bed. It was overly firm, for my taste, and the pillows were so flat it was like sleeping with no pillow at all. All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

The breakfast on the roof terrace on a summer morning is magical, although the breakfast itself is very repetitive, there was plenty of it This time our adult daughter accompanied us complete with a broken arm in plaster. However the hotel arranged adjacent rooms and we were set fair for a good time. Then I noticed we had no drawer space, only hanging space in the wardrobe. As we were staying a week this seemed crazy. However a visit down to reception sorted it out and they moved is to a very nice room further down the corridor but still close to our daughter with lovely views towards the Italian Parliament Building. The rooms are kept spotless and they were both large with decent sized bathrooms and good working showers. The air-conditioning was worse than useless and could never get the room cooler than 29 degrees. We did complain and someone came and said it would be sorted but it never was. The furniture that some complained of being beat up have missed the point that it is supposed to look old and has been artificially \u2018distressed\u2019 The staff were friendly and helpful and one night when my husband and I went to a concert, the bar staff made sure my daughter was OK, chatting to her and making sure she was not hassled. The bar prices for cocktails (any spirit and mixer drink is called a cocktail in Rome) were cheaper than at the local restaurants. On my birthday a bottle of prosecco (Italian champagne) was on ice in our room courtesy of www.travelcounsellors.com our travel agent, and the hotel had put nibbles and nuts with it, so it was a lovely surprise after a hot day of sightseeing. Take a folding umbrella to Rome in August, not for the rain but to use as a sunshade especially for the open topped touring buses. A tip about Rome in August. On the 15th of August is a festival that dates from the time of Emperor Augustus called Ferragosto. This is a day when Romans leave the city and free concerts and events are held so that those who cannot leave have something to do. We went to a fantastic one on the Spanish steps complete with opera singers, dancers and firework. Take note - Between 7am and 9 am the city is deserted, so those of you who like me are keen photographers can fly round the city photographing all the sites without people on them. The streets and piazzas are empty. Even when the tourists wake up it is still a lot quieter at all the sites and queues are not much in evidence. The Vatican Museums are closed the 14th and 15th, but an early start meant we got in within 15 minutes of it opening the day afterwards. Do not miss the Doria Pamphilj Gallery, round the corner from the hotel which is the largest privately owned art collection in the city. Rome now charges to go into the Ancient Forum but the ticket includes the Coliseum and the Palatine Hill and if you are over 65 it is free. Get your tickets at the Forum gates not the Coliseum as the queues are long there and once you have got your ticket at the other places without queues, you walk pass the Coliseum queue with your head held high ! I would go again the the Hotel Colonna palace at the drop of a hat. I recommend the restaurant Zio Ciro opposite the Maddelena church just 5 mins from the hotel. They do wonderful pizzas, salads and grilled steaks and chops to die for and very reasonably. They have another branch opposite the Pantheon but it does not have the same menu, no grill!

It was entertaining occasionally during the day when protesters would \"address\" parliment with their concerns by shouting their list of grievences from behind a small barricade. The staff here was just wonderful. All were extremely nice and helpful. We loved the breakfast which featured hand crafted capuccinos with the little foam heart on top.

We stayed in the hotel for 5 nights. Best part of this hotel is location. It was absolutely perfect, 3 minutes to Pantheon, 5 mins to Trevi Fountain and 10 mins to Spanish Steps. 20-30 minutes to Colloseum and Vatican. We never used public transportation and walked everywhere. Hotel is located on the Piazza and in very safe location next to the Parliament builiding with 24 hour armed guards. It's also very quiet cause it tucked away on a side street, and we usually slept with our window opened and AC off. Our hotel room was large with a double bed, desk, TV, 2 chairs and a small table. We had a room facing the square which houses the Parliament and the Obelisk, which was very nice. After reading more recent September reviews, it seems like some travelers weren't as lucky as us. Out room was very clean, well air conditioned, and light. AC was working all the time. Bathroom was brand new but still the problem with the half shower curtain where the floor gets soaked... however, it's quite popular in Europe, and every hotel has the same thing. There was a large granite counter in the bathroom to put all our toiletries. We had a mini fridge, full of drinks, but were able to put some of our own drinks or snacks in there. TV had no engish channels but we were never in the room that much so it didn't matter to us. The hotel has a lovely rooftop terrace which is were you enjoy your breakfast or can sit at anytime and take in the views or have a nice cool drink. Our first night we were so jet lag, that decided to stay in the hotel. We went and bought various snacks (olives, pizza, etc), a nice bottle of wine, and had a dinner on the rooftop. Very romantic as we had the rooftop to ourselves. Breakfast was fabulous on a roof terrace with a great view. Breakfast was quite generous with croissants, rolls, yogurt, canned fruits, cereal, cold cuts, pound cakes, juice, etc. Coffee is good and they also make capuccinos to order. Hotel also has a nice front desk with a bar working till 12am with very friendly bar staff. Overall, hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating. One note is that the rooftop Jacuzzi was not working, but the bathroom had Jacuzzi which we used. There are lots of choices for lunch or dinner. We ate at a different place every night. The best place was Osteria Romana on Via S. Paolo. Hands down the best restaurant in Rome. Incredible food and service. The owner of the place was having dinner right next to us, and shared later his homemade cookies. Trust the waiter and experience a true roman cuisine - no menu, just choose meat or fish, and be prepared for course after course of delicious food. We must've had 4 different courses plus dessert. Tiramisu and house wine is not to be missed. A true highlight of our trip. To sum up... Loved the location of the hotel, loved the staff and nice clean remodeled rooms. As we slept with our rooms open (it cools nicely in the evening), we would leave for our day of sightseeing leaving the window open. The cleaning staff would make up the room, close the window and turn the AC on so that when we came back in the afternoon for a short rest, the room was very comfortable and we relaxed in a nice cool room before venturing out again.

We chose this hotel primarily for its location, and in that we were not disappointed. We were able to walk to everything--the Vatican was about a 30 minute walk, the Colosseum was about a 15 minute walk, and, if you don't mind an uphill jaunt, the Borghese Gallery was also within walking distance. It's a block from Giolitti's and there are plenty of restaurants to choose from in the area. Since we're on the positives: I was also impressed with the breakfast included in the room rate. I thought it was quite generous, with enough to keep one full through a good portion of the day. Also, the room was clean upon arrival, and the housekeeping service was very good--we had interrupted them a couple of times unintentionally by coming back to the room midday for a rest. We noticed that instead of leaving the room until the following morning, which most hotels do, they made another visit later in the day after we had gone out for dinner to finish cleaning the room. Toiletries were replaced daily as were the towels--overall very impressed with this aspect of the hotel. Unfortunately, there were two aspects of the room that were deal breakers for us: the air conditioning and the bed. When we got to Rome it was in the 90s and extremely humid. We were very much looking forward to the air conditioned room that had been advertised, especially since we had arrived early and the room had not been ready, so we wandered around outside in the heat for several hours. When we were able to check in, we made an unpleasant discovery. The air conditioning was broken. At first, we thought we just didn't understand the controls, so made a call down to the front desk. We were told that there was a service man at the hotel, and the air wasn't working because it had been turned off so this man could work. We were told it would be up an running in 10-15 minutes. We waited half an hour--nothing. My husband made a trip down to the front desk to check on it. At this point we were told that it wouldn't be fixed until the next day. Even though it was by now dark outside, it had not cooled off at all. The air was hot and heavy, with no breeze. The hotel's suggestion for the broken air conditioning? Open the window. Genius. As if that weren't bad enough, when we did finally lay down to go to sleep we realized that the bed was...old. Very, very old. So old that you could feel each of the box springs underneath you, and they dug into your back, side, whatever you were lying on, from the minute you laid down on the bed until the minute you got up. It also sunk in the middle. It was so uncomfortable that my husband got up in the middle of the night and laid on the floor instead. Needless to say, we did not sleep well at all during our stay here. The air was working by the third day of our stay, but it was one of those wall units that was added later, and it was never able to cool the room down. If you stood directly in front of it about five feet away, you managed to feel a cooler draft, but move a foot or two to the side and you were back in the muggy atmosphere that is Rome. The bed wasn't in line with this breeze, of course. After the first night of being told to open the window (so that the 90 degree temperature outside could cool down the 90 degree temperature inside?), we did not go back down to the front desk to attempt any recourse. Our stay was only for a few days, so we decided rather than try to see if another room (or hotel) was available, just to tough it out. It was unfortunate, because we couldn't wait to leave Rome, not because we didn't enjoy the city, but because we didn't enjoy the hotel. I don't know if every room in the hotel is like this, or if we were just unlucky, but based on our experience, we will never go back to this hotel.", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOur Haven in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Tykissy", "ReviewID": "UR8375806", "Content": "Date: 16th July 2007 Reviewer: Cruiser from Australia We had a 4 night stay post a Greek Isles Cruise.

From the moment you walk in, it is everything you are expecting from photos and information you obtain from reviews and sites like this. Compared to other hotels we considered and saw, as we were with a group of friends that stayed at 3 other hotels in Rome, the Colonna Palace won hands down for its star rating.

Anyway the rest of the hotel made up for any upsets. The hotel is in an excellent area.........walking distance to most attractions. We walked past the Trevi fountain at least twice a day and the hotel is short taxi ride to the Vactican and costs 8 euro or you can get any of the numerous buses that go there.

However, if you bear this in mind, and want a very clean hotel, in the best location in Rome, then book this hotel now! The downstairs bar and reception areas are very nice, which makes a good first impression. We had a large modernised room at the front of the hotel, overlooking the Italian parliament , which was spotlessly clean, with a remodelled bathroom. We also had a minibar, with a good selection of well priced drinks. In particular we enjoyed the roof top terrace, with the fabulous views over the city. This was a great place to chill at the end of the day's sightseeing. Breakfast was adequate, if a little repetative. As already mentioned, it really is the location of the hotel which makes it such a star. I still have the blisters to prove that I saw almost every inch of Rome, and can truthfully say that I didn't see anywhere else that I would have preferred to stay. We walked easily to all the main attractions, meaning that we didn't have to use public transport at all. It was great to be relaxing on the roof top at night and then just nipping across the road (literally!) to the Trevi fountain (wonderful!). The entire staff are also lovely - you definately couldn't ask for nicer. If you are looking for a really nice meal for a special occasion, try \"Osteria dell Ingegno\", in Piazzo de Pietra, which is very close to the hotel. Its expensive, (but not outrageously so),and is a real treat. If you are a shopper, the Via del Corso, is a few steps away, but I also loved the small shops in the streets surrounding the hotel. Another good shopping street (affordable) is Via Frattina near the Spanish steps. Across the river, near the Vatican, is a nice department store called \"Coin\" and I thought the shops surrounding it where proabably the best. My best tips: 1. Try the Vatican museums at lunchtime - we did so on a Thursday, and there were NO queues! - make sure you don't miss the Sistine Chapel - breathtaking!. 2. For a change at lunctime, visit a little deli at Trevi fountain, which sells great salads, sandwiches etc etc as well as chilled drinks and an incredably cheap rate. Bring them back to the hotel's roof terrace and chill! 3. Don't get the Terravision bus service - total chaos. The hotel will arrange a door to door service for 49 euro inclusive of all supplements. A little more expensive, but well worth it.", "Date": "May 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Billerica, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cNice - Great Location\u201d", "Author": "sherylwithans", "ReviewID": "UR7720907", "Content": "The Colonna Palace Hotel is in a great location. it's a little hard to find though.

We then watched for a great deal from our travel agent for New Year and in May 06 just such an offer came up. So we snapped it up immediately and got our great deal. We arrived in the 28th of December and stayed for 7 nights including New Year\u2019s Eve. We always book a twin room so when they showed us a double bed room we turned it down. They then offered us a lovely room overlooking the Parliament Building, but unfortunately there was only a single wardrobe and two shallow drawers in the bedside cabinets, and we had 40 kilos of luggage for a week\u2019s stay. So back to reception and finally they gave us a lovely twin room with a dressing room, bathroom, its own hall area and a large sized bedroom. All this was done with the minimum fuss with no bad attitude or long faces from the hotel staff, who were great. The room was on a side street, which was a bit noisy in the day but quiet at night. It was a little dark but then it was wintertime with short days. Occasionally you could get CNN but could not guarantee it would be there, so you got fed up with nothing to watch on the TV. The bedroom was a little tired in d\u00e9cor and so was the bathroom, but it was clean and well supplied with fresh linen every day. The breakfast room is small and the breakfast was adequate, however you expect to get more than the only friut being tinned peaches and tinned prunes in a 4 star hotel. If you could eat wheat you were ok but there was no facilities for toast or anything cooked except for 1 inch squares of cooked egg omelette or a hard boiled egg. There was absolutely no variety from day to day and it was poor fare in a 4 star hotel, and the tiny tables soon filled up. In the summer you could sit on the roof terrace, but even though the weather was very warm, we were told to come inside by the staff as the tables were dirty. The famous roof terrace is ok but the view is of rooftops and TV aerials. The hot-tub on the roof was old and disconnected and a great section of the roof was like a builder\u2019s yard. However the staff are the greatest asset to this hotel. Piero has given us details of a wonderful place to visit on our next trip to Lake Garda in July. I recommend the hotel but It is no longer 4 star however expect 3 star and you will be happy. The location cannot be bettered and it is just 100 yards from Giolitti\u2019s, the best ice cream makers in Rome. Near this I also recommend the Zio Ciro restaurant opposite the Church of the Maddelena. 3 nights a week they have a free jazz combo and they offer more than just make pizza whilst you watch in there wood burning oven. The grilled pork chops are to die for. The food is hot as is the jazz !! There is lots to do at New Year with concerts, events and the Befano fair for the children in Piazza Navona.

Were were 10 people (5 couples). Having been the one to research and choose the Colonna Hotel, I was a bit concerned after reading some recent reviews. Let me say that my fears were relieved as soon as we walked through the front door. We were immediately greeted by Francesco, the conceirge/front desk attendant. One review I read said that Francesco and the staff were rude and arrogant. Let me state emphatically, that was not what we experienced. All of the staff were friendly and very attentive. We choose the Colonna because we wanted to experience some of Rome's \"old world charm\" and for its location. Both of these requirements were met by the Colonna. All 5 rooms were different, but all were clean, roomy and made us feel like we were in Rome. The location just can't be beat. You are literally 2 blocks from the Trevi Fountain if you walk to the right of the hotel. I f you turn left at the hotel towards the back and walk 2 blocks, you are at the Pantheon. Walk another 2 blocks, you are at the Piazza Navona and if you continue another 2-3 blocks, you are at the Campa di Fiore. The Colesseum is about a 20 minute walk and so is the Vatican. The Spanish Steps are about a 10 minute walk if you go straight down Via del Corso and make a right on Via Condotti. Lots of shopping, pretty pricey. It is true that there is renovation going on at the hotel. It is supposed to be completed around February of 07. We were never really bothered by it. (The renovations are the only reason I did not give this an \"excellent\" rating. If they were not going on, I would have rated it \"excellent\".) You cannot sit outside in the piazza because of the scaffoling, but the roof top terrace more than makes up for it. The terrace has wonderful views of Rome. We sat there and had breakfast. The wait staff was very attentive and quick to bring us our coffee. The breakfast is buffet style (very good) but a full \"American\" breakfast is available if you want to pay for it. We stayed up on the terrace one night and watched the sunset and just enjoyed the fantastic view. The piazza it is located in is very safe as there is some sort of government building across from the hotel and there are policemen there 24 hours a day.

Head South West and in 3 mins your at the Pantheon, From the Pantheon Head West, for 5 mins and you\u2019re at Piazza Novona, 2 mins South from here you will end up at Camp De Fiori or if you choose to go North West for 7 mins from Piazza Novona you will end up at Castel Sant\u2019 Angelo, 6 mins West from here you will end up at Basilica S. Pietro. If you choose to go East from the Hotel for 4 mins you will end up at Trevi Fountain. Again from the hotel if you head South for 10 mins and you will end up at Capitoline Hill, 2 mins south from here and your in ancient Rome. Lastly If you go North for 8 mins then East for 2 mins you will arrive at the Spanish steps.(Bring a compass. The maps in the guides look easy on paper but when your actually there in those narrow streets with no street signs and your looking at the size of the Pantheon it can be confusing which way east or west is) 2. Safety \u2013 This hotel is probably the safest hotel in central Rome. There are cops everywhere around this hotel 24/7. Piazza Colonna is a square with all government buildings so there are cops night and day. (No need to do a night tour with a guide there are soo many people out during the night and you could walk to everything within minutes I did the night tour my first day for just safety reasons, but after my 2 weeks I felt it was a waste of money) 3. Free Breakfast buffet \u2013 I stayed there for 13 days and the spread was pretty good. They had croissants, cold cuts (very fresh), cheese, sponge cake, hard boiled eggs,eggs cooked with bacon (I don\u2019t know what it was called), Bread rolls with 4 jams type, peaches, apples, watermelon, Amazing coffee (I didn\u2019t even missed my Tim Horton\u2019s) Cappuccino, Tea, Hot chocolate, Orange juice and pop. (This saves you a few Euros each day which by the end of 2 weeks adds up to 100\u2019s of Euros saved for 2 people) 4. Shopping \u2013 This hotel is in the Shopping District step out the door 1 min East your on Via de Corso Street go North and shop till you drop. There is Zara, Diesel, Energie, Miss Sixty and a lot of clothing stores down this street go all the way North you end up at Pizza Del Popolo (u know your there when u see the obelisk) now head down South to Via Del Babuuino and you will find Gucci, Prada, Fendi, Armani etc, etc\u2026 ( I suggest you go in the 2nd week of July or 2nd week of January. Major Sales up to 80 % off, I got some Armani glasses for next to nothing & Energie was like 60 % off) 5. Service \u2013 was 5 stars all the way, We had a huge bed (2 doubles pushed together) with very soft clean sheets, the beds where very comfy, there was no noise, room had AC, Bar fridge and a TV. The washroom was good. I always placed a towel on the floor because when the tiles got wet the floor was extremely slippery. The D\u00e9cor is dated, there is no restaurant in this hotel (they do have a bar though) and the TV didn\u2019t work. But who cares. However if you\u2019re the type that loves to stay in your hotel during your vacation and prefer to pay 30 to 50 euros for your breakfast, and pay more per night for a modern look, and don\u2019t like to eat out and finally love to take taxi\u2019s or even the metro with the Europeans to get to a main site then this hotel brother is not for you. By the way if you have never been to Bangkok then you really don\u2019t know what a 5 star hotel is really like. 6. TIPS \u2013 there are so many restaurants by Piazza Novona to try out, our favourite was the Big Apple great prices for great food. It\u2019s the middle street on the west side of the P. Novona. If your going to eat at a restaurant outside by the Pantheon or Campo De Fiori you will have to pay a lot for the bread they give you and you will be charged a service charge just for sitting \u2013 you can refuse the bread as I always did and you wont be charged. Also if you go by the Pantheon you will see a Mc Donald\u2019s there (facing the McD\u2019s go left down the street and on your right you will see a grocery store buy your water and beer there take it back to the hotel put it in you bar fridge and enjoy) or if you prefer pay 3 Euros for a water bottle then that\u2019s your choice :) Ive read 5 guides about Italy and Rome the best one is from Frommer\u2019s Rome Day by Day I did everything in this book and was totally satisfied with it. Lastly arrange the airport transfer to and from this hotel it only cost 42 euros which is a steal.

Luxury and 5 star amenities are not what I look for in a hotel. Location, cleanliness and safety are most important to me and I found all three at the Colonna for an excellent price ($125 USD on Expedia). The room was a single and yes, it was small but I didn't spend much time there. The bathroom and bathtub were clean and adequate. I don't know what type of TV stations were available because I never turned the TV on. The weather was perfect at the end of March so AC was not needed. Keeping the shuttered windows open let in a very nice breeze. The surrounding area seemed quiet to me but I am used to city noise. The staff was also professional and very courteous from check in to check out. Check in did not take long. The staff provided maps and sight seeing advice and then I was escorted to my room. I would especially like to mention the man (didn't get his name) who was working at the front desk later that night. He went out of his way to arrange my airport transportation for the next morning. While I was out sightseeing I saw a 24 hour airport shuttle advertised on a billboard for 27 euro. He called the number for me but unfortunately it was already booked. There is also an airport service offered by the hotel for 42 euro. This was booked too so he recommended taking a cab to Termini (about 15 - 20 euro) and then taking the train to the airport (about 10 euro). He even went on the internet to print out the train schedule for me - definitely 5 star service! When I checked out in the morning, he was still working and called a cab for me. I am a young, single woman and felt very safe staying at the Colonna and walking in the surrounding area. The location is EXCELLENT - within walking distance of many tourist attractions (Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Pantheon, Piazza Navona). I took the metro to the Colosseum and walked back because the weather was beautiful - and I stopped along the way for dinner and gelato. I also walked to the bars at Campo de Fiori that night (about a 15 min walk). One suggestion about arriving by cab: Piazza di Montecitorio is difficult to get to because of all of the narrow cobblestone streets (if you can even call them streets - they are more like allies). I would recommend telling the driver to go to Via del Corso (large main street) and Largo Chigi. There is a plaza (not sure of the name) with a tall pillar and a fountain in front of it (see the picture) on the west side of Via del Corso just south of Largo Chigi. If you walk to the right of this (straight back), you will run directly into the Piazza di Montecitorio and the Colonna will be on your left.", "Date": "May 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lantana, Florida", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location\u201d", "Author": "roslynpines", "ReviewID": "UR4941909", "Content": "Colonna Palace was the perfect spot for us.

What is indeed of four, if not five star quality, is its location, right in the middle of the historic centre, less than five minutes from the Pantheon or the Trevi Fountain, and just a stone's throw from Via del Corso. So the Colonna Palace gets full marks for location. The staff was friendly and efficient, but not to a greater extent than should be expected from a supposedly high class hotel. The breakfast terrace is, indeed, magnificent and has great views of Rome's roofs and church towers, but the quality of what one is offered to consume for breakfast in this grand location is, unfortunately, best not spoken of. (I know Italy is not a country that is reknowned for its breakfast, but I have had much better elsewhere in Rome and Italy.) The lobby, bar and reception areas are also very nice and look like an old 'palazzo'. However, once you get to the floors with the rooms, the glamour decreases. Corridors and rooms alike were in urgent need of renovation, as was the bathroom. However, the place was clean. A fellow traveller compained of noise from the streets, which is imaginable, given the single glasing windows, but I had no such problems. However, as indicated above, while I can't say that anything was seriously wrong with the Colonna Palace, I just didn't think that it got anywhere near four star quality. I have travelled quite a lot in Spain, where four stars usually guarantee a much higher standard, so I was disappointed to find a hotel that was only OK. Value for money is, in my view, nothing the Colonna Palace stands out for - on the contrary. Would I stay there again? Yes, probably, if I got a good, cheap deal. Definitely not if the standard room rate was charged (or indeed anything above 120 euros for double room per night).", "Date": "November 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cColonna Palace was amazing!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4147616", "Content": "My fiancee and I stayed at the Colonna Palace last week for 4 nights.
