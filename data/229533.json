It is not great, but more than satisfying. The room was small, as we have come to expect in Europe, but adequate. The bed was a bit narrow for two people, and my only real complaint was that the mattress seemed to sag into the middle. Mind you, we were so tired from enjoying Paris each day that we barely noticed. The location is a short walk from the Eiffel tower along the river. If you are lucky and crane your neck, you might see the tower from your room. We ended up sitting by the river at the end of each night of touring, watching the last round of the fabulous lights on the tower. Magical. The hotel is a moderate walk from the nearest metro, which is not on a main line but easy enough to transfer to. We took the metro home each night after seeing Paris. The hotel is very close to a bus stop that has service right along the river, including direct access to the tower, the Louvre, and many other sites. We took this bus in the mornings. It was very full, but we got where we wanted to get to efficiently. The service at the hotel was great. They provided valuable advice and also arranged a shuttle to the airport that we had not planned on, but the price and convenience they were able to provide was great. We used the computer in the lobby to print our boarding passes -- a must for efficient travel these days. We did not eat at the hotel, but did sample a few things at the nearby cafes -- very good. I am a geek who travels on business doing geeky things, so I always rate the geek factors. For this hotel there was free wireless Internet, but you do have to ask the desk for the Wi-Fi code. The network was adequate, and I did get done what I needed to get done. I did have trouble finding free plugs in the room to charge the geek toys, but I managed by unplugging a lamp.

But Would I Return . . ?\u201d", "Author": "Room_210", "ReviewID": "UR110605387", "Content": "First off, two common themes you'll find in the other reviews of the EKH are (1) very small rooms, and; (2) very friendly & helpful staff. I can tell you, those are both 100% accurate. I haven't stayed in Paris before, but have traveled much of western Europe: and other than Killarney Ireland, this was easily the smallest space I've slept in yet. Room enough for 2 adults I suppose, if they're on good terms. But not the room for two PLUS a child any larger than a bread loaf. The staff (primarily Bernard and Simone) are helpful and courteous to a \"T\" . . . nothing seems to be a problem at this hotel. Breakfast is good value for 10e, and the hotel is kept very clean. The EKH is at the tip of a busy intersection though and you do get a good amount of traffic noise when your windows are open (but NONE when they are closed). In general, the EKH is good value for the money. But. There are some issues to keep in mind. Two thoughts pop into your head when you wake in Paris: what can I see today, and what am I going to eat? So how does this hotel rate? Location: The EKH is simply not ideally located. Don't see how it can be argued otherwise It's two bridges above the Eiffel Tower, placing the EKH at the distant end of just about anything you'd want to see in Paris. Yes, it can be a fairly pleasant 30min walk to the tower in good weather, and you're close to a bus line (#72) or metro that will get you most places you want to be. But it's not comfortable walking distance to anything really, and not in sight of anything other than maybe the top 1/4 of the tower if you're on the right side of the hotel. Bottom line, the EKH feels a bit isolated, in fact. If you're not picky about your hotel being at the center of the action, heck, being at the center of *anything* then this won't be an issue for you. For me, honestly, it was something of a problem. Food: there are some very good restaurants near the EKH. There is an excellent, yes excellent, Japanese/Sushi restaurant right across the street (Sushi Gourmet, #2 Japanese on TripAdvisor). Small but well worth being crammed into. A few blocks 'up the hill' is Passy Mandarin, very acceptable Chinese. We had 3 entrees, all very very good, making us wish we had ordered a fourth. Also a few blocks up the hill, on Rue de l'Annonciation, right across the street from the Grace de Passy church, is a nice Mexican restaurant . . . but the name escapes me. Can't miss the Mexican and Texan flags outside though. What's missing from that restaurant list in Paris? French cuisine! We ate french food near the hotel, including the restaurants recco'd strongly by Bernard . . . but found all of it to be just 'OK' . . . pretty forgettable stuff. And of course pricey (but so was ALL of the food outside of the cafes). Now it could be we just caught the wrong nights, restaurants can be that way . . . but yeah, bottom line we weren't thrilled with the French cuisine we had in this neighborhood. So the verdict . . . would I stay again? I don't think so. And that's not an indictment of the hotel itself, rather just a personal preference to be in a larger room at hotel a bit more centrally located to, well, something. Would I pay more for that? Yes, in hindsight I would. Would I take a hotel with a lower Trip Advisor rating? Yes, I believe I would. If you opt to stay at the EKH, I think you've made a decent choice . . . just keep in mind that there will be some tradeoffs. You'll get a very friendly experience, but in a small, fairly isolated, package. Note: I rated the EKH 'very good' which is probably a hair above what it actually rates. But it's better than 'average' . . . why is there no 'good' rating on TA?", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nicosia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful location - wonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "vkyriakos", "ReviewID": "UR110475819", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel while being on a business trip to Paris.

The staff speak wonderful English, so if you're worried about how to get directions -- or just worried about language in general -- you won't have any problems at all staying at the Hotel Eiffel Kennedy. The hotel is a nice walk from the Ranelagh metro stop, so if you don't want to have to transfer using the nearest RER line, you only have to walk up Rue L'Assumption, which isn't a bad stroll. I'd say it takes about 10 minutes, depending on how quickly you choose to get there. One tip: When first arriving and exiting Ranelagh station, regardless of the side of the street you emerge from, you'll want to simply turn around and walk towards the way your back was facing as you exited the stairs of the station. You'll quickly hit Rue L'Assumption, and simply make a left. Walk to the bottom of the slightly inclined 'hill' and you're there. Yes, the rooms are small, but that's Europe. And quite honestly, how often are you in the room anyway? You'll be out seeing the sights. Bernard is wonderful and so is the night staff and Simone.

I liked the bed it was very comfortable, and the fridge helped also. We did use the A/C and it worked ok. The shower worked overall but the tub was a few inches off the floor so was tricky getting into and the tub had a angled bottom so my footing was not as sure as I would like. The water was hot but regulated so it took time to wash. The room was cleaned daily and the staff was nice overall. The first day was slightly dissappointing. We had just spent 10 hours on trains getting to the room from Switzerland and we had to wait 15 minutes for the one desk clerk to check us in because he was giving directions around Paris to another guest. It was a painful 15 minutes. I understand giving good directions but they should be more aware of the people arriving exhausted and might want to take care of them before going long winded explaining the finer points of how the metro works. I really loved the breakfast, it is overpriced for what it is but we got a great rate and included breakfast thru the BritishAirways website. There were always different baked goods like tarts and egg and ham pie. There was also cereal, yogurt, cheese, different breads, coffee, tea, juice, fruit. My favorite was a berry tart and the egg and ham pie. All of it was cold but some things were offered to be heated up. The tables were cleaned sporatically, most of the time it was very clean and other times we could not find a clean table. Overall I liked the breakfast because it was all you can eat and I usually ate alot. It was much easier than finding an overpriced bakery or cafe to have breakfast. Paris is so spread out that it was nice to have at least one easy meal to count on each day. Location wise the hotel was pretty good 15 minutes to the Eiffel Tower along a very nice park. There was a nice streetside market midweek also. As for other sights they are a distance away. I imagine staying in the Latin Quarter would be more central to most sights or Rue Cler but you are going to have to travel to most sights anyways. The RER stop is close and will get you to the Champs de Mars (Eiffel Tower) stop easily and from there it is a pretty easy transfer to most anywhere. There are some bus stops near by as well but the bus system is slower and is not always going in the direction you will want. We never made it to the closest Metro stop since it was unnecessary due to the RER stop much closer and ties into the metro at the Eiffel Tower. Get a good dedicated RER, Metro, and Bus maps since the combined maps leave out alot of detail you will need to get around. I liked this hotel, it would be nice to be more central, but I could not find a hotel available for the same price and rating in a more central location so I grabbed this one. Rental Apartments are nicer but there is a deposit and key hassle with those and since this was one of 3 stops for us I didn't need anymore complications. I would recommend this hotel, there were no surprises and overall the staff was friendly and helpful. I did appreciate the cleanliness and the elevator. Also there are 3 markets close by that can save you a bunch on food costs. There is also a cafe and a bakery practically at the front door. Overall on a scale of 1 to 10 I would say an 8.

The only drawback at the time was that the hotel is next to Radio France building, which was experiencing some renovation. So the front of the hotel was in front of a construction field. IT was not a problem at all since they stop working quite early. I definitely recommend this hotel if you want to experience the typical Paris feel.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cParadise in Paris!!\u201d", "Author": "YianniosFamily", "ReviewID": "UR73845199", "Content": "We found the best value for money hotel in all of Paris!

That impression stayed with us for all areas we used - from the exterior, reception, stairs, bedrooms, breakfasting area. In addition, from the word go through to our departure we received a friendly, helpful service from Bernard and his colleagues/staff at Reception and from the girls serving le petit dejeuner. Le petit dejeuner, which we opted for every morning offered a healthy variety and good value for money at 10 euros per person (at time of visit because there was three of us sharing a room which included our teenage son, we benefitted from an offer 3 breakfasts for the price of two). It was also a bonus when Bernard advised us on arrival, that a triple room was available to us for nights 3 and 4. At time of booking, only available accommodation for 4 nights was a double room with an extra bed ( 2 adults and our son) which didn't pose a problem for us as we considered it purely a base to return to after a day of sightseeing but must say we were very grateful for the extra space. The hotel is at busy junction but effective double glazing shuts out traffic noise. Excellent air conditioning to counteract the effects of hot, balmy summer nights! Transport links to/from hotel to Paris are excellent - a five minute walk to the nearest Metro station and 2 minute walk to bus stop for the regular number 72 service which is a 10/15 mins bus ride to city centre passing landmarks including the Eiffel Tower, Place de la Concorde, Tuilieres Jardins. The Eiffel Tower is a comfortable 20 minute walk from the hotel. As a family we are great walkers so for 3 out of the 4 days of our stay we chose to walk the 40 minutes each way it took to get to the Champs Elysee and back.

Maybe a 30 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower- we hopped on the bus. The only thing I didn't like about our room was the handheld shower in the bathroom. Our wall attachment was missing (our girls had one) so you really do have to hold the shower head (hard to wash hair). Not a huge deal. Nice sized bathroom. Must shut the windows at night to drown out the significant city noise. We did this and put the air conditioner on and slept fine. We ate at 4-5 restaurants all within 1-2 blocks and liked them all EXCEPT the one attached to the hotel (no connection). Ate the 10 Euro per person hotel breakfast a couple of times downstairs but none of my family eats enough to justify the price. Went accross the street to the bakery and store and fed entire family for less than 10 Euro. Food and beverages expensive in Paris.

The breakfast is 10 euro ( reasonable price in Paris). - Maid: She made the room and toilet very clean. 2) Location: quite near the center of Paris. The area looks safe to me 3) Restaurant: The French caf\u00c3\u00a9 in front of hotel is good. I had the fish main course(13 euro) which included fish, salad, bread (with free water). When I had dinner near Opera, I had to pay for Evain( no free water) for 5 euro. There are the small Chinese and Japan rest nearby. I had the Chinese food- just Ok but cheap. 4) Hotel: Window is soundproof but the wall is not. Sometimes you can hear from the next room- but not the major problem. The room is very clean but small( this is Paris). There are 2 small grocery and drug stores near the hotel. Con- minor problems, not serious - There are 2 train stations near hotel. They are a little bit far(but not too far). RER C is about 5 min walk uphill. The metro is 10 min walk. - The hotel should have small note papers in the room.

While I can say that most of the staff were very helpful, and the hotel conveniently located to the Eiffel Tower, it was not quite what I had in mind. When we arrived and checked in, we realized our room was right next to the elevator. My mom ask to switch it to a quieter location and Bernard was super nice, and provided us with another room pronto! The room we booked was a double, twin bedded room, and I have to say it was pretty tiny (as most are). However, just coming from Florence, and from a nice sized room, this one was kind of a letdown. The beds were ok, nothing to scream about, but I was thankful they had plenty of pillows. The bathroom was a decent size, however the blow dryer was so ancient, it took me about 25 minutes to dry my hair in the morning. One complaint I have is that there was only one mirror - in the bathroom, which meant that if my mom was taking a shower, I had to prop my compact up on the window sill and attempt to do my makeup and hair that way. Very inconvenient, and I think this is something they could easily change in the rooms. Even though the hotel is located off of a busy street - the windows are pretty sound proof (except when motorcycles go by, you definitely hear those!). The breakfast in the morning was awesome, and cooked homemade by the owner's wife. She was very pleasant and welcoming every morning when we came down. We really enjoyed the marvelous offerings and coffee! As I mentioned before, the hotel was in a good location for the Eiffel Tower, but that's about it. There were not many restaurants nearby, unless you wanted to walk ten blocks away uphill (for my mom, that was a little difficult in the evenings). There is one restaurant next door but it wasn't that great and we opted not to eat there. The RER stop is a short walk away which was nice, and there was a bus stop at the end of the street. It just took a while (and some changing) to reach places like Sacre Couer. I would have to say, out of the staff, Bernard (the owner) is the most helpful and friendly. He provided us many recommendations for getting to sites, and thoroughly explained how to get there. Simone, another employee, was not so great at this. When we asked her questions, she seemed annoyed and gave very vague directions that we were unclear about. The computer in the lobby is helpful for checking email or weather, but since there is only one, it was often being used, so trying to find a time to get to it was hard.

When I looked at the Eiffel-Kennedy website I had a careful look at each room and, comparing the reviews, it seemed to offer good value for money. Moreover, the people who did their reviews seemed to be enthusiastic about it. I had a bad surprise when, in entering the room I found that it had nothing to do with any of the pictures posted on the website. The room wasn't even a triple: a very small bed with wheels was added in an already tiny space. On top of it, the noises coming from the pipes/toilets flushing (without even counting the noise coming from the adjacent rooms) was at times unbearable. The room rate per night was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac179.00 with a night discounted to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac149.00... What really got me though -and my review on Booking.com has been truncated at that point- is that a small pack of crisps and peanuts was placed in a basket along with four clean, empty glasses -I thought- as a welcome gesture. I took it as such because there was no indication of the contrary (there was no minibar at all in the room nor any tag/menu brochure with prices).

If you're looking for a quiet hotel in a good location and not pay the high prices that you can expect in Paris then this the place for you. I must admit my first impression was I was not impressed with the hotel. Over my stay it did grow on me enough to say I would recommend it to a friend. On the most part the hotel staff is friendly with the day staff being way better then the night. For me the older gentleman who works at night would rather you come in, get your key and don't ask for anything. I'm not saying he was really rude but you could tell he just didn't want to be bothered. If you come in late at night as we did, ask him for ice he just loves that. Ok, sorry inside joke but do ask him. Our room was always clean as for the hotel it self. They have free Internet which makes it nice for communicating back home. I didn't eat the breakfast there. The location is good, your close to all train and bus stations. I did walk back from the Eiffel tower on New Years Eve and it took us around 20 minutes. This was at a very fast pace so if you are just strolling along then plan on about 30 minutes. There are a lot of small restaurants in the area. I can't really recommend any because I only ate at one. There is a small convenience store across the street that I found very useful. This was my first trip to Paris so here are a couple of thing that my help you on your trip. First if you are a soda drinker then forget it in the restaurants of Paris. You will pay on average 5.50 euros for one soda. For me this still blows my mind especially when you can go across the street from the hotel and buy a 1.5L for 1.90 euros. There was one restaurants next to Notre Dame I paid 9.2 euros for one soda. If your looking at the entrance to Notre Dame the restaurant just to the left on the corner is a huge tourist trap, stay away. If your going to Louvre then get there early because the lines do get very long and I do mean long. Same with the Eiffel Tower. All in all my trip to France was good. The Hotel Eiffel - Kennedy helped at to my experience.

It was probably all the size you would need if you aren't planning on staying in your room all day - which we definatley weren't!

We used the subway to get around and there is a station about 5 minutes from the hotel. Now, don't get fooled by the name, the hotel is a good 20-30 minute walk from the Eiffel tower! When we first arrived at the hotel, I must admit I was a bit surprised as it looked a bit older than what I was expecting. When we got to our rooms, we realised that it was actually meant to looked that way. In our rooms, things looked old but were actually new. The beds were in great shape (two twins) and the amenities were very nice. Now, don't expect a huge room with a gigantic bathroom, afterall this is Paris! The breakfast buffet, served in a small room in the basement, was very nice. All the options were there and, if you couldn't find what you were looking for, the personnel would go to great lengths to meet your needs. Overall, I think the best part of the Eiffel Kennedy was the personnel, from the desk clerk to the woman serving breakfast, everyone was really nice and willing to go the extra mile.

The walls were covered in fabric, not wallpaper, and it seemed to have absorbed the smell of previous smoker occupants.

We selected this hotel because of the comments made on trip advisor and it must be noted that most of them are very true! The hotel staff are very friendly and very willing to give you advice on where to go and how to get there. One instance was when the receptionist told us that it is very convenient to get the number 72 bus which takes you right along the river and past all the main sites. The hotel resided in a residential area of Paris which felt very safe for the 3 of us, all women. We were walking around some of the back streets from a near by metro station about 10.30pm and never felt threatened, in fact all we actually saw was people jogging around that area. We had a double room, with an extra bed, which was an adequate size for the 3 of us. Some would consider it slightly on the small side, but we only slept in the room and nothing else, so the size was never an issue! The only downside was that the hotel room never had tea making facilities but we brought our own kettle so again not a problem! The bathroom was a surprise! After looking at several other hotels bathrooms we had just resigned to the fact that bathrooms in Paris are tiny, but our bathroom was a great size, it never felt cramped, in fact it was just a perfect size! A great bonus of this hotel is that it has a restaurant/cafe/bar attached to it, very friendly waiters and serve food until really late at night! However, the downside of this is that because of the area you are in all the menus are in French! But when we asked the waiter to interpret he was very helpful. One tip, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask for a bottle of house wine they charge you \u00c2\u00a317 Pretty expensive! Also right across from the hotel is a patisserie that sells lovely croissants and baguette sandwiches, a chemist, supermarkets that are very handy to buy food for picnics. One other thing that is quite important is that the hotel is very close to main RER stations and metro stations. We got the RER from Porte Maillot to Kennedy/Radio France station, and then it was about a 5 mins walk to the hotel. We then used \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcJavel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 RER across the bridge to get to all the main sites, for example Notre Dam, Louvre etc, and also to get to Versailles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on that point everyone MUST go and see the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau of Versailles, one of the most spectacular things I have ever seen!

The location is away from the main sites, but in a neighborhood with a very homey, friendly feel to it. Lots of people walking dogs, lots of people with kids, etc. When we had dinner nearby, we were the only Americans each time, and that was great, we felt we really got a taste of the local scene. Great shopping is nearby. There's a bank machine right across the street, as well as a great bakery and nice convenience store. Bus #72 is a few blocks and the 20 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower is on a pedestrian walkway in the middle of the Seine, it's fabulous!

The breakfast offered at the hotel was also very good. Only downside is that they do not have a bell boy for assistance with luggage. Overall, it is one of the best hotels in 3 star category.

We arrived by car from outside Paris and found it easily. When we were unsure we phoned the hotel and got a clear guidance from the kind receptionist. We arrived a little early (about 12:30) and asked to leave our luggage at the hotel. Fortunately one of our rooms was ready so they let us put the suitcases there. We were traveling with 3 young children. We got two rooms next to each other. No connecting door. Both rooms were very tiny. The rooms for the children had a folding bed in, next to the double bed. Plenty of towels, some better quality then others. The rooms were bright and nice, very clean with flowers on the window seal, which gave it a really nice atmosphere. With some effort we were able to spot the Eiffel tower from one of the rooms. The Hotel staff was very kind and helpful. They helped us get a good rate for the airport shuttle since we were 10 altogether (please be warned that if you do not fill a taxi they will stop at other hotels to collect more people). At the check out they thought we used some chips and peanuts that were placed in the room (mind you, one would have thought those were complimentary, but apparently they are not). Since we denied ever using them it was deducted from the bill with no argument. On our first day we tried to find some restaurants in the evening. But this is not a good place for restaurants. There were only 3-4 within a reasonable walking distance. We ended up at an Italian restaurant which was excellent (visit cards at the reception). On our last day (and on our way to the airport) we decided to go for the hotel's breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was really nice. Pies and quiches, cakes and hard boiled eggs, bread and toasts, baguette, corn flakes, butter, cheese yogurts, juice, coffee, tea and chocolate for the kids etc. We paid 10 Euros per adult and a reduced price for our older child. The two young children were free. For an additional charge you could have fried eggs and bacon, for example. But we were quite please with the egg & bacon pie.

While in Paris, my family and I stayed at the Hotel Eiffel Kennedy and would like to recommend it to anyone who is planning a trip there. My daughter works for a large international hotel chain and we could have stayed at one of their properties for a considerable discount. However, I wanted to experience Paris and part of that experience was staying at a French hotel. I discovered the Eiffel Kennedy through TripAdvisor. Dispite my desire to stay at a small French hotel, I was feeling somewhat apprehensive about making a reservation at an unkown entity. I read most of the Eiffel Kennedy's reviews contained on this website (and other sites). I would now have to say, I agree with the positive comments made by all the others of this hotel. The location is out of the hustle and bustle of every day tourists' areas, yet close enough to make them easily accessible (metro and bus line are close by). We bought a 3 day pass for the metro and bus but ended up walking everywhere (used the pass twice). The walk from the hotel to the Eiffel Tower is an easy one. We also easily walked to the Louvre and Notre Dame (we're in relatively good shape but by no means fitness buffs). I will say we slept well each night after all our walking. It's wonderful how the people of Paris \"stroll\" and seem to take time to enjoy the scenery and there are so many beautiful parts of Paris to enjoy. The staff at the Eiffel Kennedy was welcoming and friendly. Simone gave us great tips concerning transportation, safety measures, sights to see, etc. The rooms were European small (larger than I prepared myself for) and very clean and comfortable.

The hotel met and exceeded all of our expectations, as did the area it's located in. The room was an average size for European hotels. We were in room 212, in a spacious double bed that was very comfortable, clean and the pillows were great (my sister and I actually both said \"These pillows are great!\"). There is a desk in the room, and under the desk you will find the outlet :) The room was very clean as well. The drapes kept the light out and the windows kept the noise out (not that there was much noise, the area was pretty quiet for the most part.) It was awesome to look out our window every morning and watch people walking their dogs and parents walking their children to school, and then gaze out the window at the Eiffel Tower at night. There was an individual air-conditioner in the room that worked great. Just keep in mind it works on Celcius! The TV got CNN and a few French channels. The bathroom was very clean. I'm VERY picky about bathrooms and this one was very good. There was a little pipe leakage behind the toilet, but only water. We loved our room too much to say anything, and it was not a big deal at all. The shower had really great water pressure and you could take a bath if you wanted. It wasn't cramped at all. The hair dryer works - it looks old, and it doesn't have the air pressure that our American blow dryers have, but it gets the job done. The walls were a little thin, but that's like every other hotel in France and probably Europe. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. They bid us Bon Jour, Bon Journee, Bon Soir and Bon Nuit whenever we saw them, and were very nice to chat with. When our voltage converter broke and we asked where they could be purchased, the staff brought out a box and tested our products with their own voltage converters until they found one that worked! They let us use it for the rest of the trip free of charge. There is free internet on a computer in the lobby. And free Wi-fi access in the hotel rooms. The elevator will hold two people with some bags, or one person with large luggage. Under the hotel is Cafe a la Fontaine, it's open until 11:30 (23:30) at night. Their food was really delicious and the staff was very accommodating. Prices were good too. Also under the hotel is a liquor store and a Tabac. Across the street is a Bakery (with DELICIOUS chocolate croissants), Butcher, Pharmacy, Convenience Store (open late late late too), ATM, Asian restaurant, and two days a week there is a Market. Down the block a little is the Post Office and a small grocery store. You have everything you need right there! The area is quiet and charming. It is only a 5 minute walk to the RER station Pdt du Kennedy, and a 10 minute walk to the nearest Metro station Ranelagh. If you walk about 20 minutes up Rue Raynouard to Rue Passy, you will find a Monoprix and Passy Plaza - an indoor mall with a grocery store, Gap, H&M, and Zara among other stores. You can also walk to the Eiffel Tower from the hotel! It takes about 25 minutes - but it's a REALLY REALLY pleasant walk. Take the Allee des Cygnes (Alley of Swans) island on the Seine - which is a pedestrian area - to Pont Bir Hakeim. Cross the street to a lovely rose garden walkway that takes you right to the Eiffel Tower. Also - if you go this way, the restaurant Iolanda at Bir Hakeim is terrific. Ask for Khalit or Mario. They were wonderful. The house Lasagna is the best I've ever had - and my dad is a chef! The creme brulee was pretty incredible too, and the prices were REALLY great. I absolutely adored this hotel.

We were out walking the streets after midnight many times and never felt uncomfortable at all (3 women) The location was near a local market, bakery, cafe, street market on Fridays and a short walk to a Monoprix dept. store. Great location.

Reception staff was outstanding -- they handled our numerous questions with a smile and all of their recommendations for restaurants and attractions were great. All spoke English well. Rooms - we booked rooms 321-322....2 separate rooms that can be converted into a suite with a separate, lockable door (door stays open if rooms booked separately)....you could even see the top of the Eiffel from both rooms. This worked perfectly for our 4 person family (2 adults, and kids aged 10 & 12). Rooms are \"average size\" for Paris (i.e., on the small size), but are well-kept and very clean. Food: There are many good restaurants in the neighborhhood, covering all price ranges and types of food. Breakfast is available at the hotel - for a family with kids it is perfect due to the convenience and buffet style - omelettes, wide selection of breads and cakes, fruit, juices, coffee, hot chocolate.

For groceries - there is a full grocery store across the street; there are also smaller markets within a 2 minute radius that are open until 11-midnight....and also on Sundays. Various tourist areas aloing the Seine (Eiffel/Louvre/Point Neuf/Notre Dame) easily reachable via Metro or via bus line #72, which runs every 10-15 minutes (you can use same tickets as /pass as Metro). We used this bus several times.....drivers must be used to tourists...all were very patient, helpful and friendly.

Upon our arrival we were both weary from the travel, but excited about going out and seeing the sights. I had been souring my travel books for months and had created (or so I thought) the perfect itinerary. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a smile. Although I studied french for a year before the trip and had 3 years previous experience in highschool french class, my french was horrible and slow. It really is hard to try and communicate thoughts quickly in a foreign language. I have a new found respect for those who speak multiple languages. The owner who checked us in was very patient and nice. He showed us a map of the area and pointed out interesting spots. We went up to our rooms (316 &316) which were right next to eachother. The Rooms: Clean yet dated. The room is small and smells of smoke, but has a certain je ne sais pas quois? It is cute. I also liked that we could open our windows to see and hear a busy, bustling Paris, and then shut them again to complete silence. The bed looked like it was going to be awful, but it was actually very comfy. Girls, watch out, the hairdryer provided is probably 30 years old. It is quite the contraption, but it gets the job done. I also could not find any outlets to plug my ipod or other electronics into, I did bring a converter. The tv has one station in english, but I could kind of make-out the dialogue on the early morning cartoons. When you leave the hotel, you leave the key at the door with whoever is at the desk. If you get back late to the hotel you have to ring the bell and eventually a sleepy attendant will let you in. The Food: When booking through BA Holidays, the breakfast buffet is included. I would not pay the 10 euros they charge otherwise. It is not really a full breakfast, more continental fare. But still delicious. When I would get ready in the morning, I would see the owner run accross the street to the local bakery for a baguette to bring to the buffet, bust most of the stuff was homemade. There are restaurants in the area as well as several convenience stores and small markets. Location: Not in the center of everything. You could probably walk to the Eiffel Tower, but it would be quite the trek. Still, the location is close enough to RER (5 mins) and Metro (7 minutes). I personally thought the area was very nice. The main city has lots of graffiti. I liked the residential neighborhoods, and in the morning we watched parents taking their kids to school and walking their dogs. Service: Very nice. Their tends to be some misconception that the French are rude. I have never encountered this. I do however work in retail and experience rude Americans all the time. Anyway, they put up with my \"french\" and I think that they were pleased that I did at least make some effort. We Americans do tend to expect others to cater to us. Problems: Not really any. The second or third day there, though, we were in the cellar leaving breakfast and the second we pushed the elevator button, the electricity went off. Surely, this is not the fault of management. We were just so glad we were not in the elevator because it really is the smallest thing I have ever encoutered. My dad and I barely fit (and neither of us is huge). We took the stairs the rest of our stay. Overall: Great. There were no problems. The fact that free internet is offered is a nice touch by the management.
