On a canal opposite a gondola repair yard [Fondamenta Nani ?2mins from Zattere vaporetto stop] in Academia district there are two bars, one's a wine shop and they are both great fun, the food very different and cheap.

Other hotels in Venice may require you to take an expensive 'Vaporetto' and perhaps pay for porters, not the Santa Chiara. As other reviews have stated, take the Airport Express bus from outside Marco Polo Airport arrivals and 20 minutes later, it drops you off at the Piazza Roma, from there it is a 3 minutes walk to the hotel. The airport express cost 5 Euros for a single journey, or buy a return ticket for 9 Euros. My wife and I visited late February and were in Venice for the last couple of days of the carnival, it was very crowded, but still breathtaking. Unlike some other reviews, we found the receptionists to be extremely helpful and polite. Our room was very warm, as February evenings remain very chilly. The hotel is located on the west side of Venice, perfectly located for water taxis, trains, buses and for walking. Walking is the best way to see Venice, ensure you have comfortable shoes and a decent map, we were given one by the (unhelpful!!) receptionist at the hotel when we checked in. We were also given another map by the (Unfriendly !!) receptionist when our original became a bit 'worn'. Even with a decent map, you will get lost, but its quite enjoyable attempting to find your way back! Another excellent way to see Venice is via the Grand Canal, 6.50 Euros buys you a Vaporetto ticket for one stop, or 10 stops, take the No1 Vaporetto from Piazza Roma to San Marco, one end of the Grand Canal to the other....amazing. Buy a 16 Euro, 12 hour Vaporetto ticket for great flexibility for as many journeys as you wish, just remember to Validate your ticket! My wife and I spent a day in Verona....another breathtaking city. Again the Santa Chiara receptionist surpassed themselves by assisting me in train times and printing them for me, they also helped me with my Italian language skills to ensure I purchased a 'return' ticket. To complete this review I would like to thank all the Santa Chiara staff for making our stay in Venice a memorable occasion, our room was cosy and inviting.

The Vaporetto stop is a mere minute away with access to all the sites. We walked all the way to St Marks on the first day and it really is not far if you don't want to invest in the Vaporetto tickets. We had an issue with noise after our first night, more to do with noisey guests than the hotel and were swiftly moved the next day to a room on the second floor, which had an inner door which successfully soundproofed us from any further disturbances. Beds are a little firm for our liking, but did not stop us from sleeping after a full on day sightseeing. The hotel was a warm respite from the bitter February weather in Venice, each day we actually returned to the hotel at some point to recharge cameras and have a warm up. Management were always courteous and friendly whenever you presented yourself at reception. Breakfasts were plentiful and delicious. Only used the bar once because they had no ice available for the drinks, given the freezing weather conditions perhaps they thought nobody would want ice in their drinks?

Unless you don't mind spending a fortune on a water taxi, or you don't mind pulling your suitcase up and down cobbled lanes and over bridges to another hotel, this is the place to stay. The hotel is directly beside the bus stop that takes you across the bridge to the mainland (and the airport). It's the only place in Venice where there are motorized vehicles. It's also beside the main station for the water buses that ply the waterways through the city. And, also very close to the train terminal. It was the absolute best location I could imagine in Venice. The morning we needed to leave to go to the airport, we walked out of the hotel, across the sidewalk and onto the Blue Bus that leaves about every 20-30 minutes and costs 5 euro per person. It took about 30 minutes for the non-stop ride to the airport. Be sure you find the bus that goes directly there without extra stops. The hotel is also convenient to those going to and from a cruise ship. We did have to pull our luggage through the port area, but just outside the port is an overhead tram (they call a \"people mover\") that takes you directly to the plaza where the hotel is located. It cost 1 euro per person for the trip from port to plaza and was only about a 3 minute ride. You might think being so close to all this transportation would make the hotel a noisy place to stay. We didn't have any problem. We were on the second floor, overlooking a side canal and the room was just fine. I read where you should ask for a room in the \"main\" hotel, which I did. I didn't notice where the annex building was (I'd read that it is a bit further away), but we were happy with our hotel situation. Plus, the room was not expensive by European standards. For the middle of November, we paid a total of 90.50 euros per night and that included a fairly decent buffet breakfast, which is always a big plus. The room we had was a decent size and the bathroom was good as well. The TV even had an English-speaking station (British news station), which was a treat after a week in Rome with no English TV at all. The bed was too firm for my taste, but my husband had no problem with it, and we made out for three nights. The hotel has charming features as, I believe, it was once a private home, built several hundred years ago.

The area and location are very good which is one reason we chose it. On the plus side, the decor was good, and it was quiet. The view was magnificent. On the minus side, well, here's our list: *powerpoints fell out of the wall as we pulled plugs out *missing button on tap *chips and scratches in bath *low water pressure *discoloured and rusting bathroom fitments *chimney smoke on our 'luxury' terrace *needs decent fan in internal bathroom * Insect screen needed against mosquitoes *breakfast crockery not well washed This was my Australian cousin's holiday of a lifetime, and we were very disappointed.

It's in Santa Croce, a very nice area of Venice that is out of the crazy crowded areas around St. Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge. We found lots of tempting restaurants and had one of our best meals at a small local place we found on one of our walks. A vaporetto stop is practically right out the back door. In addition to the hotel, there is an annex a short walk away along the canal. We stayed in the annex. The room was gigantic, with all the amenities you would expect from a nice hotel. The bathroom was huge and spotless. For those not familiar with Italian door keys and lights, you open the door with the key, then insert it in a plug inside the room, and then have power for the ilghts, etc. Breakfast was very pleasant, in a beautifully deocrated room facing the Grand Canal. Since a lot of their clientelle seems to be coming or going to a cruise, they are used to holding luggage before checkin and checkout. There is a computer available for guests, as well as wi-fi if you have your own laptop.

The hotel was booked by us primarily because of its suitability for the disabled (I am disabled, a very slow walker and needed the disabled-suitable bathroom which proved to be fine. The shower is designed to be operated without the need for a shower curtain, (it's not missing, as was suggested by a previous reviewer. It's my understanding all the rooms in the Parisi are disabled-suitable. It may be annoying for some to have facilities easy enough for fully able use but not needed, though I can't see that as a problem). Having read previous reviews, we knew it was a separate building from the Santa Chiara, so that was not a surprise. We were relieved to find they had not exaggerated about its location, in fact you would be hard pressed to find a better location - It's within a short walk (right on the edge) of the Piazzale Roma, where the shuttle bus (5 euros) arrives from Marco Polo airport and just over the new grand canal bridge is the station area - Piazzale roma is effectively the transport interchange for Venice - for vaporetti, coaches, cars and trains (the Santa Chiari and Parisi are the only hotels in central Venice which can be reached by car). It all sounds convenient but maybe not too attractive, which did concern me before we got there and in reality, nobody would want to send home postcards of the square itself. However,though they may exist in a modern environment, both the Santa Chiara and the Parisi face onto the grand canal and sit right on the canal bank. It's a lively environment all during the day and evening. The first stop on the number 1 vaporetto route is very close, almost to the extent of feeling like a private vaporetto station for the hotel ( the stop is callled Piazzale Roma Parisi). Even with my walking difficulty, I sometimes opened the French windows and took the short stroll down the pleasant private lane to watch life going on at the vaporetto terminal. Being at the start of the route is a big advantage for getting on the vaporetto and after an inevitably tiring day exploring Venice, being able to get off again within yards of our hotel room was fantastic. All staff were pleasant and helpful (at reception they spoke perfect English) and both rooms were attractive and clean, the beds comfortable and clean. The bathroom was unusually large. I was surprised at a previous comment that the walk to the Santa Chiara for breakfast was far too long. For a normal walker I'd say it is not far at all, (though of course for somebody who has wallking difficulty and depending on the indivdual, it might be felt a long way). We were fortunate to have great weather and that made it a pleasant stroll, which I could manage. Within a few yards of the front door are a good a good little 'supermerkato', bank, cash machine and post office and there are good places to eat in the area. Although I can fully understand that visitors ravelling to Venice might prefer to stay in a more romantic ancient building - and the Parisi is undeniably a modern building, the advantage of having facilities that work properly outweighed the lack of history and the convenience for travelling around Venice allows you to see more of what you went there for. I've rated the children activities 'terrible' because I wasn't aware of any activities, or indeed any children, in either the Chiara or Parisi but really I would have preferred a 'not applicable' option, as our children are all young adults. Very difficult to know if value was good or average compared to other hotels, so settled on average. Overall, I washovering between very good and excellent, settling on very good, though actually I can't offer up a real negative and certainly, we would go back. .", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkshire UK", "Title": "\u201cGood Location But Tired\u201d", "Author": "serenity133", "ReviewID": "UR118650477", "Content": "We stayed two nights and the location is superb however the hotel is tired and in need of refurbishment.

The waste bins were not emptied daily. The shower head was half blocked allowing only a dribble. The freestanding aircon unit was quite inadequate and agreed as such by the staff. The breakfast buffet was nearly always depleted as so little was put out. Replenishing was always a time consuming business. Likewise the coffee service was extremely slow and clearly the young lad involved was not up to the work. On our last morning the buffet had ants crawling over it. It is obvious that there is no appointed housekeeper who makes regular checks to ensure that the facilities are up to scratch To cap it all, having paid a charge of 245 Euros/night I was then charged an extra sum of 80 Euros for car parking.

It is right on the canal, in a pleasant area. The hotel reception is clean and welcoming, and the rooms comfortable, especially for a 3* hotel. The style and decor are not up-to-date, and some might find that a problem. But I felt that it made me feel that I was for sure in an old Italian city, and that is much better than anonymous modernity. Breakfast was not wonderful, but perfectly adequate - and included in the price. The price was high by Italian standards - but reasonable compared to many other hotels of a similar standard that I looked up. If, like me, you need to combine a bit of business with pleasure and need to use internet for more than just a quick check of emails - look elsewhere. A wireless internet service was available which , they told me, covered only the reception area. But even there the signal quality and bandwidth was hopelessly inadequate, with download times so slow that many web operations I wanted to do, and sites I wanted to look up, simply did not work. And as I seemed to be the only person in the reception area, and as I tried on multiple occasions, I don't think a high load from multiple users was the explanation. I could accept all this for a free internet service - but they had the cheek to charge 5 euros. All of the staff were polite, and some were genuinely helpful. But some seemed bored by \"standard\" questions and gave short but useless answers. For instance to the question \"Where can I find a cash dispensing machine?\" one guy told me \"Go out of the hotel and turn left - or turn right. There are machines all over the city.\" Sorry: but that does not help much. Later in the day I asked someone else who actually wanted me to find the machine and told me: \"Go out of the hotel and turn right. Then take the first on the right and follow the road alongside the canal. The machine is on your right\". So: some of the staff need to learn to answer questions such that guests can really understand the information - rather than just giving a short reply to make them go away. One major thing spoiled the hotel for me: they refused to turn on the air conditioning. When shown to my room I noticed it was not on and asked why. I was first told that it was because it was undergoing maintenance. I thought to myself: THAT is the kind of thing you do in the winter. So the story then got changed to the truth: we don't think it is hot enough in May to need it. Sorry: but I think this is something I think the guests should decide, not the management. However, they assured me that it would cool down at night. But it did not. It got very warm in the room as the day wore on, even though I left the window open. So when I wanted to sleep it was essential to keep the window open. That brought the temperature to 25 degrees which I think many people find too hot. It would have been unbearably warm with the window closed. The trouble is that an open window lets in not just cool air but also lots of noise from the boats on the river (until very late) *AND* the mosquitos. I had an uncomfortable sleep, and received multiple bites from which I am still itching many days afterwards. On the second night I specifically asked at reception that the air conditioning be turned on, at night at least. The friendly man there said he would pass my request on to management. But nothing was done. I think it is a shame that an otherwise OK hotel spoils things by thinking it knows better than guests about how warm is too warm, and saving a bit of cash by not providing a facility that is in advertised as being provided.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cConvenient, Clean, Wonderful View\u201d", "Author": "Leu1963", "ReviewID": "UR106562114", "Content": "This hotel is very close to the St. Lucia train station.

We negotiated an extra charge of 30 Euro per night. * Rooms in the main building have charm; however, we stayed at their second property (about 100 meters away) and the rooms were much larger.

We didn't originally know location and spent 100 Euros on a boat. We took the bus back to the airport! You'll see many people lugging their suitcases up and down Venice bridges -- not necessary at the Santa Chiara. * Staff was excellent on suggesting activities, restaurants, places to see. * They charge for internet access.

After having spent most of my trip in a rented apartment and seeing what other Venice hotels were like as well as the prices, this place was perfect. I had a tiny room, which I expected. Don't think many spaces or rooms in Venice are large. I had a tiny but very clean and efficient private bathroom which worked well. Can't say I saw many places having tubs there. Perhaps the $500 per night fancy hotels. The details and furnishings were tasteful and pleasant, adding a nice touch. My room contained a mini-bar, beautiful furnishings, tv and was air conditioned. The a/c alone was worth the price, which to me was a bargain considering its location especially after having priced other hotels there. I was extremely pleased with the cost considering what I pay for hotels domestically in the US, what I had looked at and also stayed at prior to this in Venice and using these as comparisons. I was very pleased with the breakfast. I have yet to stay at am American hotel that offers anything so nice with such a variety. The service was great too.

The Hotel was very easy to get to even later in the evening. We got a bus from right outside Marco Polo Airport and this took us to the Venice Bus Terminal - you can see the Hotel from the bus terminal and it was an easy transfer even with 2 young children and 4 suitcases! The first impression of the hotel is very favourable - very clean and well looked after. We checked in and at this point we were told that we were in Room 102. Room 102 was lovely - marble floor with a few rugs, blue silk wallpaper, shuttered windows that could be opened to give an amazing view of the Grand Canal and 3 beds (a kingsize bed, a lovely dark wood sleigh bed and a forth perfectly adequetate camp style bed). However we were told that the bathroom for Room 102 was not in the room! We were then given the key to Room 102 and were told our bags would follow us up. It was on the first floor and had a large central landing which had the doors to all the other rooms on that level along with the bathroom for our room. While we were assured that the bathroom was for only our room, to get to it you had to go out onto the public landing and then stand there (in your jammies if you dared) and unlock the door to the bathroom and then remember to stand out in the hall again to lock it before returning to Room 102. This really is not ideal at the best of times, however our youngest was unwell after a long day travelling and began being sick shortly after 9pm; with no en-suite bathroom we had to grab the bin from the bathroon and 'make-do' until she stopped being sick at around 3am! These days you expect an en-suite in your room as standard and considering the price we paid to stay here (it was not cheap) - we were disappointed to be let down by this - I expected an 'in room' bathroom. I would stay in this hotel again, (although not in Room 102, even if it was the only room available), provided that the bathroom was part of the room! (I know I am really going on about this but it was a big disappointment and a huge inconvenience). The staff were pleasant and called a taxi for us in the morning to take us to the Cruise Terminal after we had a walk around the area - Venice was truely amazing. I have thought really hard about the ratings and if the other rooms are true 'en-suite' and are decorated and kept like Room 102, then I would have rated the Hotel, Rooms and Value score as 'Excellent'. I have rated the Sleep Quality highly as despite the fact that we didn't get much sleep, had the circumstances been different the room would have afforded a comfortable night.

The hotel lobby and breakfast room is located in the main building. I did not get a chance to see any of the rooms in the main building, which had good reviews from previous guests at the hotel. We were put up for the night in the Residence Parisi located in front of the Piazza Roma Vaporetti stop which is very convenient. The room was large, about 20 ft by15 ft., however the room was dark and sparsely furnished. There was only one wooden chair, a small table, two night stands and a bed. The bed had two double mattresses, and they both sagged toward the middle and should have been replaced long ago. Since we only spent one night in Venice and not much time in the room, it was quite acceptable but for $300 a night I was hoping for a little more ambiance. When you're in the room you don't feel like you're in Venice, it feels more like a Motel 6 in the US. If not for the location and our four pieces of luggage, I would have stayed at the Antiche Figure a short distance away with our cruise companions, but they only had two pieces of luggage.", "Date": "October 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Piscataway, NJ", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, perfect location\u201d", "Author": "TravelCouple11", "ReviewID": "UR20307929", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 3 days, and it was very nice.

Breakfast was OK. There was plenty to choose from, but egg-wise, only hard boiled brown eggs (no scrambled or omelettes or anything).

One of the things that always seemed to get bad reviews was a choice of hotel near either Piazzale Roma or Ferrovia - in general accommodation near either bus or rail station can be hit and miss. However the last time I was in Venice was in December 2007 and stayed in the Hotel Olimpia right beside Piazzale Roma. I had a great stay and the hotel was wonderful - I think I wrote a review. However at that time I noticed the Santa Chiara on my way back in the vaporetti each evening and thought it looked very promising. In February 2008 I booked a flight and the hotel (through the airline's booking system) and was all set for another 5 nights in Venice starting on 3rd September 2008. In the weeks before travelling I had read reviews of the hotel on this site and was not confident of a great time. Then disaster struck. I had a minor accident a week before travelling which resulted in a major sprain to my ankle and for 3 days I could not put weight on it. I considered cancelling but, needing the rest, decided to make the best of it. The ankle sprain made organisation for the trip very difficult. That was made worse by the weather forecast I had seen on one of the weather sites which had forecast rain for most of my stay. So on Wednesday 3rd September I arrived in Treviso Airport from Dublin at about 9.45am after a very early start. So now I was tired as well as having an injured ankle. During the drive on the ATVO bus into Venice I could see that it had rained and I had fewer concerns about my lack of summery and light clothing. Once the bus stopped in Piazzale Roma my ankle started to feel better but the humidity (combined with the 2.30am start) started to take its toll. I walked down the few steps to the entrance of the Santa Chiara (not the one on the Grand Canal) and there was a small terrace with a water feature (turned on later in the day), two tables and chairs. I went inside the hotel to ask if I could leave my case there until the official check in time of 2pm and the front of house Manager (not seeing me limp) immediately phoned the housekeeping staff to ascertain when my room would be ready. When I saw him do this I said that I was in no rush and would come back at 2pm but he insisted that the room would be ready soon and I should wait. I went outside for a cigarette (I know - filthy habit) and before I had finished he came out to tell me the room was ready. Inside a porter took my case and took me up in the lift to room 304 in the hotel itself - not the Paresi which (given what I had paid I expected to maybe be booked into). The porter showed me the safe, mini bar, air-con etc and did not hang around for a tip although I did catch him in time. The room was small but what single room in any hotel is not. It was so very very clean and kept that way throughout my five days stay. The furniture was fake antique but very much in the style of the age of the building. When I opened the shutters on the window I realised that I was looking out on the Grand Canal - the only single room in the hotel with this view. If people look at the hotel website where it appears that breakfast is set out on a terrace overlooking the canal - well my room was the room under this premier room and shared its views. Despite the throbbing ankle, the heat and the humidity I quickly unpacked and headed off. The front of house Manager was very concerned that I had a map etc - no attempt at any selling of excursions though they had plenty on offer including opera nights etc. I told him that I had been in Venice many times and he wished me a pleasant stay.. Returning to the room that evening the only problem of the stay. I put this in my comment form so it will come as no surprise to the Hotel Management. The room could do with better light for reading. Because I travel alone I usually get up early, go out for several hours, come back for shower and change, sit and read for an hour and then go for dinner and come back and read some more. In room 3004 there were two wall lights but on the opposite wall from the bed. There was a lamp on the bureau again opposite the bed and another on top of the mini bar cabinet. By moving the two lights on the bureau and the mini bar cabinet I could just about read in the evening. A reading lamp above the bed would have been much appreciated. The room had a very comfortable bed, mini bar, large wardrobe, safe and the bed linen was changed every day. The hotel does not have a restaurant but they can recommend places to eat - I never asked because I knew where I wanted to eat each day. Breakfast is served from 715 to 10.30 in a light and airy room looking out on the canal and the new bridge. Breakfast was fruits and cereals, yogurts, pastries, rolls, ham, cheese, eggs, tea, coffee, juices,water etc. The porter who took my case to the room on arrival was the one in charge of breakfast, making tea/coffee and replenishing supplies. He was very efficient and very friendly as all the staff were and their English was excellent. He and his colleagues also manned the small bar area opposite the breakfast room (also with a canal view). The entire hotel was air conditioned which was wonderful after the heat and humidity of the day. In fact some nights I woke up during the night and had to pull on a blanket the air con was working so efficiently. An added plus to the hotel is that the half way point of the Regatta Storica is must meters away along the Grand Canal and I could watch the parade and the races from my bedroom window. This morning my flight from Treviso was at 10.10 and the bus left Piazzale Roma at 7.30am. However I decided to get the 7.00 bus and went down to check out at 6.30am. Once again the staff were kind and concerned - wanting to know if I wanted breakfast before I left even though it was before the breakfast starting time. Yesterday - Sunday 7th September 2008 - I met an English couple who were well travelled and \"very mature\". They were staying in the Paresi and had not one bad word to say about it. Their views on the hotel, its location, its facilities for the price you pay and its staff very much reflected mine. OK so you are staying on the Grand Canal and there will be some canal noises - emergency services etc which cannot be helped - but this hotel is ideally placed, has wonderfully obliging staff, has the standard facilities of a hotel in its class and really cares about its guests (I suppose as long as they show the same respect and concern in return).

There was a small signboard at the end of the alley with a sign indicating the name of the building. Other than that it looked like the offices next door. It turns out the room key fob had separate keys for all of these much-needed security measures!) Inside, the lobby had no lighting until you were actually inside, when a motion sensor turned on a security lamp. If someone had been waiting inside, you would have been easy prey! This was true even at night! When we got to the room it turned out that the key fob also had an electronic device which had to be plugged into a socket in the wall to turn on any lighting at all -- a terrible arrangement in the day, and impossible to manage with no lights at night! We had to stand in the dark and fumble to shove this thing into a little hole in order to see where we were going. Unfortunately when the lights did go on, they revealed a largish shabby room with two chairs, a desk and a \"platform\" bed with minimally acceptable linens and totally unacceptable foam mattresses --- overall the look and comfort of a quickly thrown together set of tag-sale furniture. The bathroom completed the impression, as it had all the charm and utility of a hospital operating suite -- one large room with an open shower at the end (with no divider from the toilet next to it) and a minimal sink at the other. The building, the lack of any sense of safety, and the horrific accommodations all bore no resemblance whatever to either the description in the Santa Chiara literature nor any photographs shown on the hotel web site. This is because we were sent to someplace other than the place we booked and paid for. When we first got to the room I immediately called the front desk and said that this was not the room I had booked, and not even in the Santa Chiara hotel. I asked to be switched back to the room in the hotel, even without air conditioning. The desk manager told me that this was the room he had for us, and that there were no refunds and likely no other hotels available, given that there was a festival that night in Venice. I told him that I had booked a room at the Santa Chiara (which at least was an historic building fronting on the grand canal) not at the shabby Parisi. He said we should be happy that the room was larger and had A/C. He further stated that this room switch was standard practice at the hotel. My daughter and I thus had no other option but to be victims of this bait and switch policy, as described by the unpleasant manager. We decided to brave the drunken revelers, grab a quick bite, and be certain to arrive back at the Parisi before nightfall, when opening the iron gate would surely be an invitation to the milling crowd. When we left for our 5:00 AM bus to the airport, we had to step over sleeping partiers and be accosted by people wanting money on our way across the piazza to return the key and check out. I once again strenuously objected to the hotel tactics, but at least felt safer being in the lobby of the 3 star hotel we had been charged for! While I did not (obviously) see a room in the Hotel, the atmosphere was decidedly nicer than what we had to endure. In sum, I booked a room at the 3-star Santa Chiara Hotel, based on the pictures, descriptions and location advertised by the hotel. We were given completely different, lesser and unacceptable accommodations and held \"hostage\" by the management who treated our every request with seemingly delighted scorn. If I had known what our room was to be like prior to booking it, I would definitely have stayed elsewhere.
