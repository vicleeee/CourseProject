We got into town and parked on the street. Luckily they have a garage so my brother was able to park the car there. The hotel is far from the historic center. It is on the other side of the main train station, close to the university and hospital. Lots of young folk around the area and lots of great, inexpensive places to eat. Walking up the steps, you go in through the automatic glass doors and head on into the lobby area where the reception desk is. The lobby is nice and large and bright. The person who checked us in was young and quite professional. She got us our keys and we headed up the elevator to our room. We had decided to all stay in one room to help with keeping cost down, so there was a queen bed and bunk beds. My buddy and I stayed on the bunk beds which was quite the adventure. I was all the way at the top and at some point at night rolled over and fell onto the floor (ouch!). My buddy and I should've probably got a separate room. The room was large, but simple. Bathroom was clean and a little on the small side. The decor was simple as well, not completely outdated, but certainly not contemporary. For the price, we did good, but everything was quite far in regards to walking, but we did do the walking just to enjoy the stroll.

I like to complain about hotels (see reviews I wrote) but here I can say \"nice no thrill, nothing special, just good service and location if you have business at University or the nearby hospital complex\".

I was thrilled that I was able to book a competitive rate for a \"superior Business Room, Luxury Bathroom Toiletries, Free Minibar, Free Room Service, Full Breakfast.\" When I got to Termini station, I tried calling the hotel for directions, and must've spent a good 20 mins dialing but getting only a busy signal. I was tired, had luggage and it was late so I just grabbed a cab even though I knew it wasn't far. (I paid 6\u20ac + some extras including a tax for having picked up the taxi at the station and 1\u20ac for luggage = 8\u20ac something). After I checked in, I asked if I did get a business room because I needed to work, and the guy wasn't sure what that was but gave me another room that he said had \"luxury bathroom items.\" Well, what I got was a normal room for 4 people - 2 huge beds, tons of regular toiletries + a sample liquid soap of some kind which perhaps made the toiletries \"luxurious\" and tons of water in the minibar fridge + 1 coke + 1 juice. I had problems connecting to the wifi but finally managed after trying for almost an hour. A local friend tried to call me in my room but had to call me on my roaming mobile to say that the hotel number was always busy - just as I had experienced earlier. Reception confirmed there was a problem with their regular number and gave me another number. Then when my friend did get through, we couldn't talk for all the buzzing and crackling on the phone. Front desk then had to send someone over to check the phone, confirm it was defective, and gave me a new phone. Then wifi totally stopped working finally and reception confirmed that this is normal at night due to heavy usage! So basically I spent the first 2-3 hours of my stay trying to use the phone and internet, very normal services that come with a hotel, and a \"business\" hotel at that! Oh and there were pieces of candy wrapper and misc bits of trash on the floor and dust bunnies under the bed and the towels smelled sour. Couldn't find an English channel on TV other than MTV.

Breakfast was fairly comprehensive, a few hot dishes but mainly cold meats, cereals rolls etc Pastries and cakes were delicious and for the good amongst us there was plenty of fresh fruit Yogurts etc. Hotel organised Roma passes for us which were at reception when we arrived. These are a must as you get free entance to 2 sites listed in the booklet and reduced prices at other sites thereafter and more importantly you are fast tracked through the queues. At the Colleseum / forum for instance we were in within 1 - 2 mins where the people in the queues were there for 30 mins. The pass also gives you 3 free days of public transport on metro, bus and tram. Metro no more than 10 mins walk away, right next to a supermarket if you want to buy your canned / bottled drinks at a reasonable price. Prices around the main sites can be 5 times more at least!

The tram takes you directly to St Peter's and is actually quicker than taking the metro with no changes!

For most travelers, public transportation would be okay. However, we had a 22 months old toddler, taking the public transportation was nearly impossible (it is so crowded...there was literally no space to breath). Anyways, so we used taxi to get in and out of the city everyday for 6 days (about 10 to 15 euros each way). The hotel is located on a busy street. The first night they put us on the 3rd floor in a room facing the main street. We requested to change room right away, and they said they didn't have any other rooms available (even though we got there around 2-3 pm in the afternoon). So, we had one sleepless night due to all the traffic you can hear from the street (yes, you can hear every car/mortocycle going by). The rest of our stay, they put us in a room facing the back street on the 5th floor. We were happy with the new room even though there was no bathtub in this room (sleep was much more important to us). There is one curly long hair girl at the front desk who is very nice and helpful (the rest of the staff didn't seem to care much).

The room itself while large made poor use of space which resulted in a substandard bathroom which resorted to a shower head mounted gingerly over a shorter than usual bath. Aside from the variable water temperature and frequent cold showers I was genuinely concerned about slipping due to the poor shower setup. The minibar which was much heralded in the hotel literature consisted of 2 soft drinks and 3 bottles of water, one of which had already been opened. Many hotels give similar as in room complimentary drinks, this one classed it as a minibar and couldn't even manage to refill it once during my 3 night stay. As others mentioned, the walls are thin so you will get to know your neighbours, whether you want to or not. Breakfast was average, lunch while delivered with fanfare was nowhere near the standard of food I've come to expect in Italy. There was free wifi but it involved the receipt system which seems to be so pervasive in Italy. This meant you needed additional receipts if you wanted to use a smartphone as well as a laptop.

We took out luggage again and went to the 5th floor where we discovered later that the the water temperature in the shower had a mind of its own making a cycle from extremely hot to extremely cold every 10 seconds, in a shower cabin where it was almost impossible to get in, turn and get out if you were more than 60kgs or 1.60m tall. We told it in the reception, they send a girl to check (who didn't understand english), she saw the problem by herself and when she went back to report the reception called asking the same silly questions just like the girl had never come!

It isn't. In most ways, it's a pretty ordinary 3.5-star hotel. But it tries to carry through a theme of games and play (its slogan, in English only, is \"Play with us at Globus\") and to be kid-friendly. The restaurant, for example, has a domino motif on the cushions, and at dinner each table has a small game. The bathroom has a rack of paper bags each with a picture of a basketball hoop and the annotation (again, only in English) \"Score with your sanitary towels\". The hotel guide to services offers to bring you toothpaste, a comb, or a beach if you've forgotten to pack your own. So despite anything on the website, my room has no skin-divers nor flying children with winged top hats. It is a plain, undecorated double room, with an entrance hall, a large walk-in closet with its own window, a cramped bathroom, and a very large balcony. The entrance hall adds little to the room, and I wish the architect had designed a different floor plan that gave some of the space to the bathroom instead. I am not a large person, but when I sit on the toilet, my knees bump the shower door and my elbow hits the toilet-paper holder. The shower itself is about as small as a shower can be. The balcony, on the other hand, is much larger than the bathroom, almost as big as the room itself. (Only on the corner rooms are the balconies so large.) It overlooks the intersection below, and much as I'd like to sit out there, the traffic noise and the strong afternoon sun make it impossible. Traffic noise is, in fact, another theme, especially the refrain of the frequent ambulances on their way to the nearby hospital. Rooms at the back of the hotel would be quieter. My room is clean and generally well-serviced. But one day, the maid takes away my partially-used (barely-used!) soap but doesn't replace it; another day, she neglects to replace an empty tissue box. The temperature of the shower varies randomly from day to day. One day it's very hot, the next it's tepid. One morning there is no hot water at all. The Internet connection can be hard to connect to but works well once you have managed to do so. The large, laptop-sized safe is not actually bolted to anything. The breakfast buffet manages at least one or two items from most of the primary European breakfast-food categories, but the largest category is Italian-style cakes and pastries (which put American breakfast pastries to shame). An interesting surprise is several varieties of artisanal honey from a local producer. The location of the Globus is convenient for people visiting the University of Rome Sapienza or other nearby institutions. For tourists, it is literally on the wrong side of the tracks. Nonetheless, Termini is a short ride on the 310 bus, right outside; the number 3 tram, a short block away, goes to the Colosseum and Roman Forum; and, although of limited use for tourists, the Metro is not too far a walk.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cService was excellent Staff extremely helpful .

We had to ask a couple of different groups of people before we were pointed in the right direction to the Globus. The Globus was located just off the map. We purchased the Roma 3 day Pass that others had mentioned. We utilized the Metro pass that was included for bus and subway. The Policlinico stop was an easy 10 minute walk away. The first and last day we paid the one Euro each to ride bus 310 to/from the Termini station. We rode the Terravision bus to/from the airport and to/from the Termini station. The staff spoke English and were very helpful. The PCs in the lobby were always available when we wanted to use them. The breakfast was wonderful as others have mentioned. We usually ate just one other meal. We enjoyed pizza from Alice's and Solo Pizza which were both nearby. My husband had his wallet in his front pocket and at the subway stop by the Spanish Steps two gals attempted to take it from him. Fortunately he felt the hand in his pocket before they were able to take it from him. We felt perfectly safe walking the streets near the hotel. Our room faced another building so we did not experience the road noise. We were able to adjust the temperature in our room. We had to ask to receive the English channels and we would have preferred FOX to CNN. We spent our days touring the main sites of Rome and Vatican City. They were easty to get to from here.

Only drawback was nothing was open nearby during Christmas weekend but lots of shops and cafes within a short walk opened nearby on Monday. The rooms were large, clean, housekeeping service excellent, bath sheet size bath towels (very nice and plenty of them). We had a small balcony with french doors and a window to get fresh air. We also had a walk-in closet which was great for storing clothes. It would have been even better if it had a door to use it for a dressing area. There were free waters and sodas in the mini fridge and the included breakfast was very fresh and beautifully displayed--assorted fresh fruits everyday, breads, croissants, 6-7 types of cereals and meat and cheeses. Only negatives were that we not no control over the heat and the room was hot at night. We were told it was controlled by the floor. You could open the doors for air but then it was noisy (bring earplugs). Also the water heat fluctuated. Only English channel was CNN, we wished we had brought movies to watch on our computer in the room when we crashed after a day of walking all over the city. The free Internet worked great, we used it in our room and in the lobby. 3 or 4 block walk to the subway and then 2 stops to the Termini where you can get on Hop-on-hop=off Buses. Lots of graffiti in hotel area but was safe, lots of elderly residents and college students. If money was not an issue, I would probably stay in the historic city center but for a budget trip with a nice size clean room and pretty easy to get around I would recommend this hotel.

The reception area is welcoming and the staff very friendly. We arrived a couple of hours before the normal check in time, but the reception staff stored our luggage and hurried the preparation of our room, while we popped down the road for some lunch.

The room was clean and tidy, and had a stereo, TV (only bbc world news in English, but we hadn\u2019t gone all the way to Italy to watch TV) and air conditioning. The ensuite bathroom was again clean and tidy and enough towels for the 4 of us. We opted for the breakfast option as part of the deal and was pleasantly surprised with what was on offer. Everything was self service, but there was a good selection of cereals, breads, meat, fruit and pastries, along with coffees and fruit juices. As other reviewers have noted the hotel is not in the middle of the tourist areas of Rome, but all can easily be accessed from the very cheap and reliable subway system.

Also saw a room with two queen/double size beds (traveled with a group of family & friends) and found that room type to be pretty large also. I paid 144.00eur per night and feel it was a good deal for Rome. Everything worked great in the room. One small negative was no hot water one morning but that was it, no other complaints. Staff was helpful but not in your face. If you needed help they were there to assist, if not a smile and a welcome back to the hotel when walking in the door was what you got. Arrived at the hotel fairly early AM and room was not available just yet. They allowed us to stash our luggage and have a coffee. Room was ready in less than half an hour and check-in went great. Breakfast was fine every AM and found everything well stocked. Breakfast consisted of coffee, tea, juice, cold cereal, fruit (fresh fruit rather than that syrupy fruit salad you typically get), pastries, bread, yogurt, cheese, eggs, sliced cold meats & a warm sausage/wiener type meat. Basically a typical buffet type breakfast. I didn't eat an actual dinner at the hotel but did have an appetizer and a drink at the restaurant one evening and it was fine and the service good. Location is close to the Policlinico metro stop (10 minute walk at most) and the metro gives you easy access to pretty much all Rome has to offer. I'd say once on the metro your looking at about 10-15 minutes travel time on the train to all the big sites. There's a tabacchi shop right across the street where you can get bottled water, coffee, pastries, sandwich, snacks, wine/beer, etc.... Not a huge selection of restaurants in the area but there are some so you won't starve if your looking for a bite. Do have a restaurant recomendation to make and though it's not right by the hotel, it is definitely worth a trip and easy to get to. The name of the place is Ristorante Mario's (www.ristorantemarios.com) and is a short walk from the Cavour metro stop (third stop from Policlinico and no change at Termini required). The food here is fantastic! I ended up eating here three times which is something I have never done before while traveling. It's really that good.

The subway (Polilinico stop on the B line) is about a 6 minute walk (and this is walking with a 7 and 5 year old!)\u2026 not far at all. My children really enjoyed taking the bus and subways. It was such an adventure to them. There are inexpensive restaurants and food places near the hotel \u2013 there is a great gelato place across the street! I thought the front desk staff were really nice \u2013 very smiley and friendly. There is a communal computer that is available for free in the lobby. A lot of people used it to send a quick email, which I did, too. Prior to booking, I read that the hotel has a Sony PS2, so I brought some games along, and requested it when we got there. We received it when it became available. They supplied it with several games. It turns out that the US version of games cannot be played on there. But it was nice that they offered it to us. The hotel also had a children movie night, where they offered a showing of Spiderman, or High School Musical, or Herbie, and had chips and soda. That was a very nice touch, I thought. Their complimentary breakfast was delicious. They offered some cold cuts, like ham or turkey slices, and two cheeses, as well as some delicious pastries and cakes. They also have cereal, fruit, yogurt, coffee, and steamed milk. You can request a cappuccino or espresso from the staff. We never found the breakfast room crowded. The breakfast room was very chic, new, and they offer newspapers to read, games for the kids to play (I guess during dinner, but we never ate dinner there). They even had an outlet in the bathroom that you can use (if you are from the US) to recharge your camera, camcorder, or Nintendo DS (in our case) \u2013 it could be switched from 110 to 220 V. You didn\u2019t even need to bring an adaptor! We brought one along but noticed it did not work for the Nintendo DS, and their bathroom outlet with the built in adaptor was a lifesaver. The bathroom was large, clean, with a tub, shower. They had 4 LARGE (almost beach towel size) towels for us. All in all, a fabulous hotel, not only for families but for anyone! We put our passports, keys in the in-room safe and never had an issue. We felt very secure there. They also have a great security system. With their room key entry system, they can tell if the room door has been opened. You use the key to get in, and when inside, you keep the key at the inside slot of the door. My husband stepped out to get some food one night, and we must have not had the key at the slot (we didn\u2019t know we had to do it), and their alarm must have sounded since they contacted us checking our names, and if everything was okay. I also noticed a security person walking around the hotel, too. We originally had wanted to stay near Piazza Navona, but it was near impossible to find a hotel room that fit four people, and the ones that did cost at least 2 \u00bd times this place, and was not nearly as nice, or had as many amenities. I am so glad we came across this hotel. Our children and we had a wonderful time, and it did not cost us a fortune. The only negative to us was that it was noisy outside. We didn\u2019t hear many ambulances going by, but the cars were noisy. It could also be contributed to the fact that we had the windows opened, since it was warm in the room. Their air conditioning system was not turned on yet since it was only April. However, the noise did not really keep us up at night since we were so tired from all the sightseeing that we slept through it. If you are hesitant on staying here, don't worry at all. It was great, and I hope this helps answers any of your questions.", "Date": "April 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gothenburg", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel outside Rome city center, good value.\u201d", "Author": "swedishtravellers", "ReviewID": "UR24659429", "Content": "We booked this hotel because of the nice price, if you compare with other hotels in the same category in Rome.

We found a great eatery down the road (to the right when you come out the door). We ate mussels, pizza and a bottle of wine for under 30 euros. The subway is less than 6 minutes walking distance. The coliseum is two stops over. The hotel is greatly located because of its proximity to the subway. While on the subway, as long as you keep your passports hidden (under belt) and your camera handy, you WON'T get pick pocketed. We got a ROMA card, they are also available in Madrid and Barcelona. You can get one at the tourism office next to the coliseum. It costs very little (30-40 euros) and you get in to many different attractions for free and it also serves as a free transit pass. One thing I remember is when we went to the coliseum it was so hot and the line was huge, but there was a special section for the pass holders and we didn't even have to line up, just show and go. Give the hotel a call before you arrive and try to see if you can get a limo service. A driver will pick you up a the airport and drive you in style. The price was 45 euros and no hassle to drive.

Despite its rating of only three stars the Globus has air conditioning in all rooms, good King-size beds, double glazing on the windows to keep the street noises out. In former years there were complaints that rooms facing the street could not keep windows open because of the ambulances' screaming sirens while they were bringing casualties to the nearby hospital. We slept in a room facing the street, and with the air conditioning on there was no need to keep windows open. Breakfast was included in the price. It was a buffet and while not being a Hilton or Holiday Inn feast, it was adequate and very far removed from the coffee and croissons that you used to get for breakfast in Europe. There was ham and eggs, several kinds of salami and cheese, good coffee, and then some. There is also free Internet for patrons. The hotel has been trying to attract families with slogans such as \"come play at the Globus\" and there are Playstations in the family rooms.

Once during the four nights we stayed there, there was a repeated knocking noise on the wall, and the staff could not find where it came from - they gave us another room. On Sunday the whole area closes down, the students go home for the weekend, and to get a sandwich you have to take a bus - these do only a skeleton service on Sundays.

Arrived at the hotel around 12.30 / 01.00 am (Transfer from airport with Rome Cabs / Stephano.....brilliant!!!!!!) No problem in checking in at such a late hour. Found rooms to be clean and very presentable, including a fridge with complmentary water and soft drinks, plus a TV with a few English language stations including CNN and Fox News. We let the air conditioning unit run all night and were not bothered by the slight noise. After a quick unpacking session we naturally wanted a drink or two. The night porter was happy enough to open the bar for us, but as it did not look too inviting we asked if there was any bars nearby. He directed us down the street about half a mile away, where we found the all night bar. This turned out to be a shop selling beer, sandwiches, coffee, cigarettes etc etc, so we ended up sitting on beer crates in the street sampling a beer or two at 2'o'clock in he morning. It turns out that it was what Italians would call a bar, but if you want a \"drink\" you actually need a cafe. Next morning we found the breakfast to be even better than what I had read about. Very attentive staff clear tables constantly while you help yourself to whatever you desire. If you are lucky enough, grab one of the four tables on the outside terrace. For all the hotel is around a mile and a half to two miles from the city centre (railway / bus station) it would not be difficult to walk. However, we purchased a 7 day pass (for all local buses and underground) at the cafe / tobacconists opposite the hotel for 16 Euro. Even using it for only 5 days represented good value. The 310 bus runs every 10 minutes or so from opposite the hotel to the main railway / bus station. From here you can get to where ever you want to be, by bus or underground. As mentioned earlier, the hotel bar is not what we Brits think of a bar as. We did have an odd quick drink while awaiting the other half of our party, and found service to be good. The nearest thing to a decent bar, was an Irish Pub around half a mile away. (Turn right outside the hotel and follow the road down to the \"Piazza\". Turn sharp right and it is about thirty yards on the right) No restaurants are available on the door step, but again jump on the bus down to the station and you are spoilt for choice. Note that the last bus leaves for your return around 12.00 midnight. No problem if you miss it, as it is not too far to walk, or a taxi will not cost the earth. Opposite the hotel is a cafe with pavement tables. Ideal for a quick drink or snack etc. Further down by the bus stop is a \"cake\" shop. Ideal to take back to your room with a take away coffee. For those who must have their morning fix of coffee, the cake shop opens around 06.00am. All in all, a clean good value hotel. Our rooms were large but we gather others may not be so. Friendly attentive staff who were pleasant at all times. I would certainly stay here again. Finally......the only minus point. The other half of our party of four reported a broken toilet seat on day two. It had still not been attended to when we left.

The hotel itself was very clean and comfortable, all of the three rooms we had were well equipped with air conditioning (a necessity in July I can tell you). The Buffet breakfast was excellent and served in the charming little 5th floor dining area / terrace. All the staff we found at the hotel to be extremely helpful and friendly and speak perfect English. The hotel location is just what we wanted and is in a quiet more residential area of Rome. Walking around this area both day and night you never feel threatened. We found this to be a godsend, as it was lovely to return to a much more sedate area of the city in an evening, and allowed us to leave behind the tourist traps (and many pickpockets) of the trevi fountain / piazza navona area. Saying that the metro stop of Policlinico is only about 5 mins walk and takes less than 5mins to reach the centre, and a taxi only costs 8 euros if you need one. There is a great little bar situated directly across the road from the hotel which serves the perfect \u201cice cold\u201d peroni, and even hands out free sandwiches with each drink!. For a lovely \u201clocal\u201d meal at unbelievably cheap prices (cheaper than in the very centre of rome) go right out of the hotel and walk for about 5 mins. It's called \u201cIl Tesoro\u201d, and the calzone is to die for, and a three course meal with drinks will set you back just 15 euros! (in my opinion this was the best food we had during our stay and I couldn\u2019t recommend it more!) So to sum up : the hotel is modest in size, it\u2019s clean, has very friendly staff, a nice \u201cout of it all\u201d location\u201d, has good transport links to the centre, serves a great breakfast, and has great restaurants within walking distance, and if like us you use Expedia can be booked for the bargain price of \u00a345 per room per night.
