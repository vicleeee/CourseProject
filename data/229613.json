Like many hotels in Paris rooms were on the small side but perfectly adequate. The towels were changed every day and all the linen was beautifully clean. The bathroom seemed to have been recently refurbished and was of a very high standard. In my contact with the hotel prior to our arrival Arnaud, who is one of the receptionists, was of enormous help in recommending a decent restaurant for our first night and organising the shuttle to pick us up from CDG. Nothing was too much trouble for him. The hotel was one of the quietest I have ever stayed in both from the point of view of internal and external noise. It is on a busy street but we could hear nothing of the outside bustle. Wonderfully situated close to a large number of cafes and restaurants. We used La Liberte at the end of the street for breakfast and an occasional dinner and a lot of people watching. The Indiana bar at the other end was a good place to have a couple of beers at the end of the day as it is right by the metro exit and has happy hour from 5 - 7!! It's not mentioned in the hotel description but we did have tea and coffee making facilities.

This small hotel is a jam for a trip when you spend most of your time outside. It has very nice \"themed\" rooms, each with a different wall drawing. It has nice showers, beds and courteous staff. The rooms are quite small, but I guess this is what you get coming to Paris. My parents were in a better room than me and they had some nice view from the top floor. The biggest advantage of this hotel is its location, which is simply brilliant. Two steps from a metro and railway stations and very close to the Luxemburg gardens and Montparnasse. My only two slight concerns regard the staff. First, I was required to pay when I checked in instead of the usual check-out payment - which was weird. This is not a strict hotel policy as my parents weren't required to do the same. Second, I tried to ask the front desk to book a taxi in one of the mornings... It turned out to be a busy morning for them and they simply forgot. I went down and waited for the taxi - after some time I asked them where it was and only them did they tried calling for one... It was a bit frustrating... I give this hotel a 4/5 due to its great location and overall room comfort.

Less than a minute away from Edgar Quinet metro and five minutes from three other metro lines it is right in the heart of a Montparnasse with little cafes and restaurants lined up one after the other. The hotel is spotlessly clean with comfortable beds, wonderful air conditioning and what looked like a brand new bathroom with a big shower. We stayed on seventh floor - room 702 with single twin beds (elevator works efficiently) and because of good air conditioning did not have to open the windows and therefore heard no noise from the busy area at night when were in our room. Such friendly, helpful staff who were also very professional made sure that my friend and I enjoyed a brilliant 5 night stay. Two minutes away from the Montparnasse Tower - 11 euros to travel the 56 floors in the elevator which takes you up to the most wonderful 360 panoramic view of the hotel. The Eiffel Tower is a pleasant twenty five minute walk down to the river Seine and you cant get lost with the Tower always in view as you walk towards it. Get a book of 12 metro tickets for 12.50 euros which is cheaper than buying them one by one at 1.60 euros. Take the 'CAR Rouge' open topped double decker red bus which you can get on at the Eiffel Tower. 24 euros for a two day pass which you can use to get on and off the 10 stops as many times as you like. They even provide a set of earphones you can plug into the wall of the bus up or down stairs to hear about the sites around the centre of the city. Take the metro to Monmartre and visit Sacre Coeur (lovely clean and cheap little cafe just at the front of it and the views over the city are amazing) Whilst you are there make sure you find the Place de Teurtre which is the quaint square filled with cafes and restaurants and also very talented artists who will draw your portrait for you at a negotiated price. - Go to dinner at Jim Haynes house on Sunday evening - near Alicia Metro stop He has a website where you can make a reservation.

The room was very nice (albeit somewhat small), with a well-equipped bathroom and a good bed. The staff was friendly and helpful, breakfast was plentiful and delicious (by French standards), and the price was excellent. It is right by two Metro stations and by Gare Montparnasse, ensuring fast access to most parts of the city. In fact, there are shuttle buses (the Cars Air France) which get you from Orly or CDG directly to the Gare - very convenient. They are a bit more expensive than riding the RER and the Metro, but they are faster (the Orly one at least) and will save you a few transfers dragging your bags. The location is reasonable - it is within walking distance of all sights in Montparnasse (mostly the Tour Montparnasse and the cemetery - don't miss the view from the Tower at dusk!), as well as the Jardins du Luxembourg. Other famous sights are relatively far, although the Metro gets you everywhere. The worst case for city sights is probably Montmartre, which is about half an hour away by M\u00e9tro (and is not exactly centric anyway). It is perfectly reasonable to take the Metro in the morning, walk until you are exhausted and then get back to the hotel. My only gripe with my stay is that they offer you a package in which, for a surcharge, they give you a Mobilis card (a 1-day travel pass) per person. It looked like a nice deal, so I signed up for it. Well, although the surcharge is applied every night, only one card per person is given for the whole stay. If you are staying one or two nights (double room) it is a reasonable deal; if not, you'll be ripped off (not by much, but ripped off nonetheless). I am specially annoyed by the fact that I asked whether that was the case beforehand several times, but they didn't answer my question - fishy! But don't let that distract you. Unless you are lucky enough to find a very nice hotel in a location closer to the centre (for a competitive price and with a great breakfast buffet to boot), this is probably one of the best deals available in Paris accommodations.

The breakfast room also had electrical sockets exposed with an expensive breakfast considering you only got croissants and coffee. We canceled our reservation that next day even with a penalty. When I asked the clerk for help he told me that they were unable to do anything and I would have to contact the online reservation entity I used.", "Date": "September 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cGreat budget accommodation!\u201d", "Author": "johnnee", "ReviewID": "UR7695419", "Content": "The Hotel is located in a good area of Paris, close to all Paris attractions and also close to transportations: trains station, metro station, airports shuttles. It is a nice and cosy place to stay when visiting Paris if you don\u2019t want to spend a lot on a room. The personnel were very nice and they speak very good English. The access to the rooms can be done by stairs and/or elevator. The tiny elevator says it can carry up to 3 persons but there has to be 3 very thin ones. Even so, it is good enough for 2 and if you kiss your partner less you\u2019ll be temped to do it there *smile*. The room was small but good enough for 2. Our room had a bath with bath tub also. They\u2019ve changed the towels and clean the room every day of stay there. Every room has a safe to store your values and it is already included in the price of the room. They have free Wifi internet in the lobby but we were able to use it only in our first day. But you can find a free spot in the street also. We did just around the corner. There were renovating the hotel during our stay: part of the lobby, the restaurant, and the first floor but even so the part that the clients were accessing was clean. The rooms are not soundproofed so you can hear from next room or when they use the showers because the walls are thin. If you usually live in a block of apartments you\u2019ll be used to it. If you intend to rent an apartment in Paris you\u2019ll have the same problem with the sound. Most of the apartments in Paris have thin walls between the rooms. As a conclusion, I recommend this hotel for its good quality/price rate and especially for young couples or singles and for budget families. I decided to write the review because I read very hard reviews before and I got very scared at the hotel thinking it is going to be a [--] our stay. I have attached some photos so others can see what I am talking about.", "Date": "May 25, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Elysee Montparnasse", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d229613-Reviews-Hotel_Elysee_Montparnasse-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$148 - $268*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">11 bis rue de la Gaite</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">14 Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75014</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "229613", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3f/f6/3ff68d59a5259ea61051e122c433d24e4large.jpg"}}
