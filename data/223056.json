{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Dirty room  This was the worst motel we've stayed in since 2001 and that's a lot of motels, around the country and the world. The floor in mirror counter/sink area was stained with what may have been blood. The shower faucet didn't work at all until I spent 5 minutes refastening it to the valve. The blanket looked like it was previously used to clean a car engine compartment and two light bulbs wee burned out. The place was really dirty. In the AM we asked for a manager and told her the room condition was terrible. She immeadiatly gave us a full refund without questions, so we suspect she was painfully aware of the bad conditions in her motel. Since Accor group acquired motel 6, they have improved a lot, but, unfortunatly, not the Dallas Southwest location.", "Date": "Jan 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR779158655", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d223056-r4367631-Motel_6_Dallas_Southwest-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "223056", "Price": "$37"}}
