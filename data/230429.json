It is a hidden gem in the heart of Paris ! small hotel five rooms on five floors. Staff is friendly and the service is excellent! Location Location Location. This hotel is right accross the Trocadero metro station. Accross the street from the Chaillot museum on one side and on the other side you get to the place du Trocadero where you can see the EIFFEL tower!! and this is really a good source of relaxation specially at night when the tower is lit and you are having supper in one of the 5 or 7 neighbourhood restaurants It is very accessible to the Paris convention center on 2 porte maillot 18 minutes walking on the same street Pointcarre that becomes Malakoff . Also 22 minutes walking distance to the Arc de Triomphe when you take Kl\u00e9ber and then you head to the Champs Elys\u00e9es Clean Clean clean!! I went there early march from the 1st to the 6th and this was a great stay!! and I explain Entrance is welcoming and staff is very helpfull. Front desk 24 hrs. Mr Yassin the hotel manager greeted me quickly and the key to the room was ready for me. Mr Mounir was very helpfull when I asked for an info. This hotel is smoke free. There is an elevator. WI FI is free during all your stay! when connected to the hotel. Remember you cannot connect to any WiFi in Paris even if you are in a restaurant or near the Apple store on Champs Elysees or nearby any Orange store ( Internet supplier) you always need a password and an Id plus an authorization.... so I think having a free WiFi is a great plus for business: you stay connected! Rooms are clean, fairley spacious if you compare it to any hotel rooms in Europe. Room service is prompt and effective! No noise what so ever!! I was staying in room 51 far from the street noise. Service is great quick and when you ask about any info they are very helpfull TV, Fridge and a coffee kettle and a choice of tea or coffee. There is extra blankets and beds are made on a daily routine. Beds are comfortable pillows are soft Bathroom is spacious, towels all kinds and toiletteries Roger & Gallet: exfoliant soap and Body and hair shampoo soft almond scent. I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would recommend it was it for business purposes or for leisure Checking out was quick and easy with the blond lady ( sorry I forgot her name) Thank you for everything!

Not the biggest room I've stayed in, but pleanty of space for my wife and I to both get ready in the morning without any issues. There was a bar in the hotel which has a breakfast in the morning. We tried in one time, for 12 Euro a person, I didn't find it to be worth it, I would recommending getting your breakfast elsewhere. Being in such a central location there are plenty of resturants nearby, 5 fairly well priced (for Paris) places within half a block. The staff was a mix, most of the desk staff spoke english, out of the four I met, only one didn't speak english but between my poor French and some pointing I was able to get through.

If you are the one to stay late in Paris and love to walk around at night, then this could be essential as this place (in the 16th Arrondosiment) is among the safest in Paris. Trocadero is crowded at 12 midnight, so you can walk from the Eiffel Tower to your hotel at that hour. There a number of cafe's right outside the hotel and the cafe Le Malekof is awesome!! The hotel by itself is alright. The elevator does not work sometimes, staff are not the best in the world, do not expect flower arrangements in your room even if you mention that you will be honeymooning. The cleaning staff were kind of spooky, but the front office staff were very helpful for basic questioning. The rooms are small, but very clean and adequate. The bathroom was well equipped and had a bath tub. The Eiffel tower view rooms, had trees between your room and the tower.

It is excellently located - right next to the Trocadero Metro station, surrounded by several restaurants/bars and just a 5 minute walk to the viewing point for the Eiffel Tower and a 15 minute walk to the base of the tower itself. Given the ease of using the metro, the location was fantastic for a weekend break. In terms of the hotel itself it matched our expectations of a central Paris hotel - ie small rooms, but we were pleasantly suprised at the bathroom containing both a shower and a bath. It was also good to have a free-to- use safe and free air conditioning. This was a particularly warm weekend and so the air conditioning was a welcome addition as trying to sleep with the windows open was difficult given the noise from the main road throughout the night . Again this was expected and did mean we had a view of the Eiffel tower - if you looked to the right out of the window! (and we hadn't paid for a tower view room either). The room was very clean and tidy although the bed hadn't been made up when we checked in at 3.30pm - a call to reception rectified this however. Breakfast was included in our deal - it was sufficient with coffee, juice, cereals, bread, cheese, ham, pastries and yoghurt. I think 13 euros (normal rate) would have been expensive for what was on offer, but then so much seemed expensive on this visit!! The staff we encountered were neither overly friendly nor surly, and one gent did try and find the tennis results on the internet for us one evening!

We were expecting a nice, romantic hotel with a view of the Eiffel Tower. Well, the hotel scores one out of three! Here's our take on the hotel: CLEANLINESS We could not fault the cleanliness of the bedroom once it had been made up each morning. We were always given fresh toiletries and had an adequate supply of toilet roll. The only public area of the hotel that we used was the bar/breakfast area and this also seemed spotlessly clean. So 5 stars on this area! LOCATION The location was the primary reason that we booked this hotel and, despite the negative points in this review, we would stay there again next time we visit Paris, purely for the location. There is a Metro station a few steps away, so not far to lug your heavy luggage. There are also several restaurants surrounding the hotel, which we made use of during our stay. If you take your life in your hands and cross the several roads to the Place du Trocadero, you will have one of the best views in Paris of the Eiffel Tower. We had a view of the tower from our bedroom, and you can request this when you book. There is a tour bus stop at Place du Trocadero, too, which takes you around all of the major tourist attractions, so this location is the ideal base from which to explore Paris. ROOMS Having read several reviews about the size of European hotel rooms, we weren't expecting a room the size of Heathrow Terminal 5. The room was small and the windows quite rickety, but we weren't in the room that much to really mind. The double bed was tiny and until I got used to it, I did not get much sleep for the first few nights! The room was very hot at times and we had to leave the windows open at night, although the noise from the streets did make this difficult. We had air conditioning (although I don't think it worked) so make sure that if you go in the spring/summer months, you choose a hotel with air conditioning or it will be unbearable. As far as public areas are concerned, don't expect much. The bar was seldom used and the man on the reception desk had to come and serve us, which judging by his surly look, was a bit more than he was expecting to have to do that evening. One evening we asked for two Coca Colas and were told that they had run out and were told to go to one of the restaurants if we wanted them. At breakfast, unless you get down pretty early, be prepared to share your table with other guests. There are about 5 or 6 small bar tables (you eat in the bar area as the hotel has no restaurant) and that's it, so if you can't find a table, you have to wait until the other guests have finished and their table is cleared. SERVICE ... and now on to the one aspect that really lets this hotel down. We had specified during our booking that this trip was our honeymoon and we were expecting, obviously wrongly, to be treated like we have read about other honeymooners being treated abroad. You know the sort of thing... rose petals on the bed, a bottle of champagne on ice in the room... or failing that, a friendly welcome would have been a start! We received none of these things. We arrived tired and hungry at 7pm and were immediately disappointed by the standard of service we received from the front desk. No welcome, no 'how was your journey' and no offer of help with our bags. We took them up to our room in the lift and went out to find some food, hoping that the next day would be better. Oh, how wrong we could be. We obviously had far too high expectations of European customer service standards, as this unfriendly welcome on the first night seemed to be the norm for the rest of the hotel staff! The waitress at breakfast would not communicate with you unless you spoke to her first, and even then it was more of a grunt than a reply. You could stand in front of her at the bar waiting for service and unless you actually made your presence known by speaking, she would look straight past you. I never saw her smile during the whole week we were there and came to the conclusion that she obviously did not enjoy her job very much at all. The other two receptionists that we encountered during our stay were much the same. Two days before the end of our stay, our room cards had been deactivated for some reason and we had to go down to reception to get them reactivated. No apology, no explanation as to why this had happened, just the usual frustrated look as if we were asking for the moon on a stick! The room cleaners, while good at their job, need some serious work on their customer service skills. It would help if they either spoke English or French, but when speaking to them in our reasonable French, they appeared not to even understand the basics for 'please come back later' and ended up getting stroppy with us! Anyway, we tried not to let this complete lack of friendliness from all of the staff ruin our stay, as luckily we did not spend too much time in the hotel with all of Paris to explore in just one week! VALUE Not the most expensive hotel in Paris but I doubt it is the cheapest, either. We paid for an all-inclusive package which included breakfast and I'm glad we did, as it was certainly not worth the stand-alone price that they seem to get away with charging for it. I did not see a 'wonderful array of cold meats' or anything else like this - there were two or three choices of cereal, some yoghurts and some croissants. On our first morning there we ordered breakfast in bed, including eggs and bacon. It arrived 15 minutes late and with a surprising lack of eggs... and indeed bacon. In fact, the eggs and bacon that we had ordered remarkably resembled croissants and bread rolls! We phoned down to see what the mix-up was and was told that they did not have any eggs or bacon that week and we should have phoned down the day before to check. Um, no... I can't actually remember ever having to do that at any hotel I have ever visited before! Perhaps I have had a narrow experience... As people have said before, if you haven't paid for breakfast to be included, then try one of the restaurants/cafes next door. They will almost certainly be cheaper and will have more choice. To sum up then, go to this hotel if you want a clean, well-positioned, reasonably priced base to explore Paris. Go with an open mind about the friendliness of the staff (i.e. don't expect any at all and then you might even be pleasantly surprised) and the size of the rooms. Eat breakfast out if at all possible and don't forget to take your own tourist maps, as I didn't see any available at the reception desk as I had expected to.", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "athens", "Title": "\u201cWorst Thing That Can Happen To You, What A Mistake\u201d", "Author": "elpinikipearl", "ReviewID": "UR30534551", "Content": "After visiting London we went to Paris for 3 nights.

Save your money and go to the Trocadero Cafe next to the hotel and get a continental breakfast for 8.50 euros or a full breakfast including 2 fried eggs and ham for 12.50 euros. This cafe also has a fabulous view of the Eiffel Tower -- be sure to have an evening cocktail there. The staff was pleasant and generally helpful.

First, the good: rooms are clean, fashionably designed, moderately sized. Eiffel-tower view (if you request it). Metro literally outside the door. Excellent A/C. Great location (Trocadero, 16e) which in my opinion is a great place to stay--it's a clean, quiet, safe, upper-class area, close to the Eiffel Tower/Champs Elysees/Arc d'Triomphe. The bad: the staff is easily the biggest issue. In particular, the Armenian fellow with black-framed glasses was extremely sarcastic and unhelpful throughout our visit. Another staff member, the older blond lady in charge of the hotel, was also unhelpful--we asked for help with a car rental and she instead recommended we give them a call with the phone upstairs. Result: the 15 minute call costed 16 euros. The money wasn't an issue, but we felt misled and taken advantage of. The one exception would be a young lady named Charlotte who seems to work on weekends--she was very nice and helpful. The bad, continued: we had a dud sink that was never fixed even though we repeatedly notified the staff. Also, upon arriving, the tub was dirty with a red-brown stain, plus I had one incident of a stained/dirty towel. All in all, it's an okay hotel. The best things about it are the peaceful/convenient location and its proximity to the metro right outside the door. Other than that, the staff's attitude and unhelpfulness somewhat dampened the overall experience. If you're looking for a charming, cheerful place to stay, then look elsewhere.

Often a little tipsy. Then wandering a 5-10 minute walk home to the hotel along the fountains, the river Seine, and across the trocadero. The Trocadero itself is really great, it is just a square but it is covered in street entertainment like human statues or crazy breakdancers. The street sellers get a little tiring but you get used to it. This hotel is loterally right next to a metro stop which is reallly handy for getting around, and dragging luggage. The breakfasts are average but sufficiant and there is a quaint square to eat it in, the rooms are fairly small but nice enough, and what you expect in Paris really unless you spend thousands. It was great to chill out in the room with a great veiw of the Eiffel tower. Highlights of the trip are On a particularly hot day we - and many others - went paddling in the fountains by the eiffel tower; driving around the grounds of Versaille in a golf buggy, veiwing the champs ellyse from the arc de triomphe, and eating a picnic under the eiffel tower. It is a lovely city and I can't wait to return next week. Tips:- - Do not to buy the champagne that the men sell you around the tower because it tastes disgusting. - The TV in the rooms has some sexy/rude french channels if that's your sort of thing. - Unless you're fluent, don't bother trying any tourist French at any of the tourist attractions because they will laugh or get aggitated. - Don't go on a bus tour, go on a boat tour. - A walk along the Mouln Rouge is really interesting even if you don't see a show.", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "McClellanville, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cAlmost Perfect\u201d", "Author": "dixiebelle06", "ReviewID": "UR8115640", "Content": "My sister and I stayed at the BW au Trocadero on July 7th and 8th. The hotel is in a wonderful location and the view from our room of the Eiffel Tower was beautiful. I also loved the room. It was very clean and the decor very nice. The bathroom was nice as well, modern and a pretty good size. We had two large windows that open completely and offer a great view of the Eiffel Tower. The Trocadero metro stop is really, really close. There are also several good restaurants close by. The hotel is in a perfect spot.

( and down some major steps) I really loved the hotel and the location. I would stay there again even with the few problems we had. The only problem with this hotel is the staff. First of all, I e-mailed the hotel a few weeks before our trip to find out about the cost of internet access. I was told to visit the service provider (www.sfr.com) website to get the rates. I did this and the rates were reasonable (15 euro for 3 hrs over 48 hr period) so I brought my laptop. ( we wanted to call home via internet) Well, these are not actually the rates. SFR and BW blocked general access and you have to buy a card from the hotel to access the internet. The cards cost 3 euro for 20 minutes. I complained about this but was told that this is just how it works- no apology. ( I even sent the e-mail back that was sent to me with the bad info.) One evening, I wanted to buy another 3 euro card and was told right away, the clerk didn't even look, that they didn't have any more. I knew this wasn't true because I saw a huge stack of the cards the last time I bought one. I had to practically beg the guy to look for the cards, then had to actually show him where to find the cards!! I knew more about the front desk than he did!! Lastly, it took 30 minutes to check out because they couldn't get the credit card machine to work. Other than those things, which I guess are minor, the place was great. Oh, yea, the airconditioner is GREAT...nice and cool.

The t.v. was small, 13 in screen, and there are no english channels in the evening, only one channel is in english in the morning, a European financial one at that, but since we were barely in the room at all, who cares. We stayed in room 43, it had a view of the street below and of the Eiffel Tower. Since we didn't get in until late every evening, the street noise was minimal, if non-existant. The bed itself though was terrible. It sags in the middle. If possible, stay away from that room. Most of the people at the reception desk speak english, but the cleaning women don't. One morning we woke at around 10 am and were still in the room when the cleaning woman came to our room and got mad because we weren't out yet! We just had to laugh it off.

We did receive a double bed as requested with a great view of the Eiffel Tower. Our room was non-smoking, and housekeeping did an excellent job of keeping the room clean and tidy, which was a challenge given the fact that the hubby and myself are somewhat messy with our room when traveling. Room details: The bed was comfortable and clean, but the mattress was a little firmer than I like. The hubby likes a firmer mattress, so it suited him just fine. There was a small desk with a writing area, and the room did have a wireless Internet connection for a small fee depending upon your requested usage. We had an in-room safe, which we did use, and we had an extra blanket and pillows as well. There was plenty of closet and drawer space to store our clothing. The room also featured a mini-bar, which had competitive pricing with the bars and restaurants in the area. I was most pleased with the bathroom.
