Horrible room. Cheap plastic furnitures in rooms. All Novotel hotels are rated three stars hotels in France and the Novotel Frankfurt provide the same service and facilities than a Novotel hotel in France.

For me the location is excellent as it is very close to my office, for most people the location will already be a no go, as there is nothing to do close to the hotel, I couldn\u9225\u6a9b even find a decent restaurant or bar in walking distance, the restaurant in the hotel is not recommendable and the bar is mostly empty. Luckily Frankfurt has a good public transportation system and relatively cheap taxis hence you still can reach downtown comfortably in about 15 minutes time. The hotel itself is a typical Novotel and as mentioned before there could be a bit more atmosphere in the rooms. Besides that I however have no complaints. The superior rooms have a good size and are clean, the bed, cover  pillows are very comfortable and the bathroom is fine as well. The staff is friendly and helpful. I would stay here again but only when visiting the Frankfurt office or the trade show.", "Date": "Nov 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR133755679", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "bowmore"}, {"Content": "Do not stay here The Dorint Novotel Frankfurt City hotel, is quite new. We were told the hotel is 4 star but definitely is not. The hotel looked like 2 star. The room has no sense and has not homely features. The bed was uncomfortable. you can't sleep correctly. The barthroom definitely reflect a 3 star standing hotel. I agree with the previous review of 1 January 2006 on the fact that this hotel has no soul at all. This hotel is lacking in character. After a 7 hours of flight you won't stay in this hotel because trust me you will feel depressed and longing for your home! Definitely don't stay in this hotel.", "Date": "Oct 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR225102310", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "hotels_like"}, {"Content": "No problems at all, very comfortable. With a free night included from Expedia this hotel was great value. Maybe it is lacking in character a little bit but so what? The rooms were spotless, tastefully decorated and even though it is right next to the train tracks it is quiet because of extellent windows. As a tourist I enjoyed my stay here very much but it is certainly more geared towards the business traveller.", "Date": "Oct 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR275330369", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bigboroboy"}, {"Content": "No Soul to this hotel. I stayed at this hotel while on a business trip. This hotel has no soul at all, I'm glad I was only staying here on business, I'd hate to have paid my own money for a holiday stay. The rooms were clean, but had not homely features. The restaurant was equally plain, with no atmosphere just a room full of business people all sitting eating on their own. I love travelling on business, but not if it means staying in hotels like this, I felt depressed and longing for my home after two days.
