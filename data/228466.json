The location is right next to the congress halls and next to the whole area of \"Parc de Montjiuc\". By 3-5 minutes walk you could enter the Metro (Pl. Espana or Poble Sec) and within 2 stops you are at the harbour or Las Ramblas. And in only 20 minutes with Aerobus you are the airport El Prat (Barcelona City Airport) You also have some restaurants and small supermarkets in the area which makes it convenient as well. The fitness area is quite okay to do some exercising but there are definitely nicer fitness areas in hotels. In regards to \"Wellness\" I have only seen the pool which is Indoor and okay to have a short swim - but it is nothing special as such. The only thing I found a bit \"negative\" is that even in Executive Room you still need to pay for a 24h WLAN card per day. And this can only be used by one device - so not per room. As we had altogether 2 iPhones and 2 laptops this got a bit complicated... But overall the hotel has a good standard, is clean, rooms spacious, breakfast very good, people and service nice and well located for a city trip to stay couple of days. But not to be used as \"Wellness Hotel\" in Barcelona.

The hotel is situated on the outer edge of the main centre, however it was easy to find the metro and for 3 Euro your wherever you want to be. The hotel is rated as a 4*, and the layout and design is understandable why this is the case, the rooms also are very spacious. However when you did deeper into the hotel, there are reasons why you would not give it a 4* rating now. In the room, I had 2 double beds, a desk, sofa, and enough space to of held a party for 20 people! The beds are not the greatest though, a bit better than a camp bed, but wont be anywhere near the standard most people expect from a 4*, the pillows also were awful. The bathroom, though was nicely designed and the quality of fittings in there made that stand out as the rooms main plus point. The shower was good and includes side shooting jets as well as the main downward stream. I found breakfast in the hotel to be very, very poor though. The hot food section was limited and there was very little \"normal\" breakfast items. Garlic mushrooms...beefburgers...stuffed tomatoes... the list of random items on the menu went on. The standard beans and toast were nowhere to be seen. Yes no toast! Could I find a toaster, not in that breakfast room. The orange juice also was like cheap concentrate, not the best. There did seem a lot of cakes if thats your idea of a breakfast. Reading the other reviews saying it was 13 Euro's, I would use that money and go somewhere else! As others have stated, no free wifi. This is a massive let down especially for a hotel wanting to be in the conference trade! Being on business I expect also if you pay for Wifi you get a good connection, unfortunately not here. It was painfully slow and if you pay 7 Euro, that is just for one device, so you cant use your phone and laptop! Overall, one of the poorer 4* hotels and for the price I paid I would definitely not be retuning at that cost, at a much lower cost I would probably return on the basis of not using the breakfast facilities and knowing the pitfalls to this hotel", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSpain without the chaos\u201d", "Author": "crowns5", "ReviewID": "UR120825558", "Content": "Although regular Australian business travelers we chose to stay 2 nights in this hotel so that we got a better quality room for a good price and were out of the chaos and noise of Barcelona central, Las Ramblas and the port areas.

However, because of the graciousness of the hotel\u2019s management (Ms. Regina Herrero, Ms. Alicia Soler, and Ms. Ana Lorenzo) and also the fact that we signed up for the hotel\u2019s \u201cI Prefer Guest Program\u201d, we were upgraded to a Junior Suite. At 60 m2, our Junior Suite was the best and biggest room that we have ever stayed in anywhere! We also had a large balcony with round table and chairs. In our estimation, Fira Palace Hotel continues to rate 5 (rather than 4) stars. What we truly liked and appreciated about the Fira Palace Hotel and the city of Barcelona: (1) professionalism and friendliness of all hotel staff (reception, housekeeping, dining, fitness center) and cleanliness of the hotel. (2) central, convenient, yet quiet location (2 blocks from National Art Museum and the Fira exhibition center, near Placa Espanya, not far from Montjuic\u2019s Olympic Ring, Joan Miro museum, Montjuic park and castle, approx. 25 minutes by foot from the heart of the city center and 15 min. by foot from the Maritime Museum and the Barcelona Boardwalk near the port). Whatever you do, be sure to see the the Magic Fountain show at Placa Espanya that currently is held every Friday and Saturday night from 7 p.m. until 9 p.m. \u2013 it is both beautiful and inspirational! (3) the buffet breakfast at the hotel (12 EUR per person) is an excellent way to start one\u2019s day, and of the 14 mornings that we stayed there we ate the breakfast buffet 10 of those mornings. It has a very broad selection of fresh and delicious food that will suit everyone (3 types of eggs, fish, red meat, hamburger, quail legs, spaghetti, sauteed mushrooms, bacon, potatoes, watermelon, kiwi, pineapple, melon, papaya, oranges, dried prunes, raisins, walnuts, pistachios, cheeses, ham, breads, pastries, cakes, muffins, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, juices, water, champagne, tea, coffee, etc.). (4) we liked the nightly \u201cturndown service\u201d at the hotel, especially since we stayed for 14 nights and liked to keep our room very organized and very clean. Also, the 3 small chocolates that each of us received every night were a true delight \u2013 we love dark chocolate! (5) also, we appreciate the fact that at our request we had a small coffee/tea machine in our junior suite with a quality selection of coffees and teas provided. (6) readily accessible, extensive, and reliable transportation system \u2013 (a) the METRO system is very convenient and extensive \u2013 to get to the hotel you can take the L3 metro line either to the Poble Sec stop or to the Placa Espanya stop. (b) the BUS system is very convenient and extensive \u2013 often we took bus 55 that dropped us off on within a block of the hotel. (c) you can buy an integrated 10-trip metro, bus, tram, and funicular card for 8.25 EUR which works out to 0.825 EUR per trip. This is substantially less than the 1.45 EUR per trip that you would otherwise pay. With this card you have 75 minutes to make transfers. (d) there are always TAXIS waiting directly outside the hotel to take guests anywhere they want to go. If you want to take a taxi to the AIRPORT (which we did this time), it will cost you between 25 and 30 EUR, depending upon the time of day or night you travel and how much large luggage you have. (e) buses (day and night) travel to and from the hotel to the BARCELONA AIRPORT. In 2009, we took the Aerobus bus to the airport, and at that time it cost 5 EUR per person. There is a night bus N17 that runs from 23:00 to 05:00 and costs 2.10 EUR per person. (7) we found a couple of new restaurants this time that we thoroughly enjoyed: (a) Market restaurant, Comte Borrell 68 \u2013 approx. 10 minute walk from hotel (b) Les Quinze Nits restaurant, Placa Reial 6 \u2013 approx. 20 minute walk from hotel (c) Ciao Roma restaurant, Mallorca 210 \u2013 approx. 20 minute walk from hotel All 3 of the above restaurants had good fixed price lunch menus for 9.95 EUR from Monday through Friday, approx 12:00 to 16:00. (d) Wok Dao, Villarroel 1 (at corner of Tamarit) \u2013 lunch buffet for 8.98 EUR We also returned to the following 4 restaurants that we liked in 2009 (see 2009 review for addresses): L'Antica Napoli , Basilico, La Bodegueta del Poble Sec, and Trobador. A couple of minor comments about our stay at the hotel: (1) internet connection - occasionally the internet connection at the 2 internet stations in the lobby and conference room area (with a total of 6 computers) did not work stably, although in 2009 there were not any problems with the internet connection. Even so, the hotel has a tech person who can address all problems. Also, there is a printer hooked up to the computers, so this is nice if you need to print something. (2) iceberg lettuce \u2013 we prefer a variety of salad greens at breakfast, rather than only iceberg lettuce. For some reason on October 13th we had a variety, but all of the other mornings we had only iceberg lettuce. (3) the junior suite has a separate living room and a separate bedroom. While there was a tv in the living room, it would have been nice to have a tv in the bedroom as well since it times it is nice to lay in bed and watch a little tv. However, of course, we did not come to Barcelona to watch tv, so this was not a major concern. We had a TRULY GREAT stay at the Fira Palace Hotel and look forward to staying there in the future when we are in Barcelona! By the way, during our stay we checked out some more hotels in Barcelona, this time in the Diagonal del Mar area (we walked from there to Villa Olympic and checked some hotels along the way). 1. Barcelona Princess Hotel - Avinguda Diagonal 1 http://www.hotelbarcelonaprincess.com/barcelonahotel/en/index_en.html 2. Marriott/AC Hotel Barcelona Forum \u2013 Passeig del Taulat 278 http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/bcnfo-ac-hotel-barcelona-forum/ 3. Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona - Passeig del Taulat 262-264 http://www.hiltondiagonalmarbarcelonahotel.com/ 4. Barcel\u00f3 Atenea Mar - Paseo Garcia Faria 37-47 www.barceloateneamar.com In our opinion, only the Marriott/AC hotel has nicer facilities (e.g., sauna, turkish bath, whirlpools, outdoor swimming pool, etc.) than Fira Palace\u2019s facilities. However, Marriott/AC is located in a more \u201cbeach\u201d part of Barcelona and is really a resort-type hotel. Hilton has a good-sized outdoor swimming pool, but other relaxation facilities are not as good as at Marriott/AC. Both Marriott/AC and Hilton have decent gyms (by hotel standards anyway), but not nearly as extensive as Fira Palace\u2019s gym. However, in terms of hotel room sizes neither Marriott/AC nor Hilton is even close in size to a standard Fira Palace hotel room - both Marriott/AC and Hilton have what you could call a \u201cstandard\u201d European-size room (Hilton\u2019s is a bit bigger, but still considerably less that at Fira Palace). Our verdict \u2013 EVEN IF Fira Palace, Marriott/AC and Hilton were all located in the same district of Barcelona, we would still select Fira Palace because its hotel room and gym are simply unbeatable in our estimation! As far as the other two hotels go (Barcelona Princess and Barcelo Atenea Mar), there is really no point in comparing them with Fira Palace since Fira Palace beats them \u201chands down\u201d in facilities and rooms. We decided to include this comparative information so that potential future guests of Fira Palace will know that with this hotel they get a REALLY good deal in the city of Barcelona (unless they want to spend 2-3 times more for an even more central location). Our Prior November 8, 2009 Review of Fira Palace Hotel: \u201cFira Palace Hotel is an Excellent Hotel Providing Excellent Value!\u201d We are a middle-aged couple from Russia and the USA. We usually stay at 4-star (and occasionally 5-star) hotels and resorts. We stayed at 4-star Fira Palace Hotel in Barcelona, Spain for 11 nights (September 25 \u2013 October 6, 2009). We reserved a standard double room and paid an average daily rate of 109 Euros (room only, taxes included). We booked our room via www.hotel.info and were very pleased with its services (our many thanks to Mr. Lothar Deptner and Mr. Armin Blamberger for their help). The hotel is located two blocks from the National Art Museum and the Fira exhibition center, near Placa Espana, and not far from Montjuic\u2019s Olympic Ring (site of 1992 Olympics), Joan Miro museum, and Montjuic park. The hotel is approx. 25 minutes by foot from the city center, and for the reasons stated below we considered this a definite advantage. All hotel employees that we encountered (reservations, reception, piano bar, cleaning, repair, fitness center, restaurant personnel) were very professional, nice, helpful, and hard-working. Our hotel room was the best and biggest room that we have ever stayed in anywhere. Ms. Ana Ciria in the hotel\u2019s reservations department was most helpful in responding to all of our questions that we submitted by e-mail before our arrival. While Fira Palace Hotel is supposedly a 4-star hotel, compared to the other 4-star hotels and 5-star hotels that we have stayed at in Europe and elsewhere, in our estimation Fira Palace Hotel rates 5 stars! Our comments regarding our 11-night visit are as follows: HOTEL LOBBY The hotel lobby was very spacious, elegant, immaculately clean, had beautiful fresh flower arrangements, and truly \u201cinvited\u201d hotel guests to sit there and simply enjoy the scenery and the atmosphere. HOTEL ROOM The hotel room was a \u201cgigantic\u201d size at 42 m2 (approx. 450 square feet). The room was \u201cdivided\u201d openly into three large zones \u2013 bed and television zone; couch/sofa bed with long coffee table and mini-bar zone; writing desk/chair and round table/chairs zone. The room was immaculately cleaned on a daily basis and supplied with excellent Gilchrist & Soames toiletries. The large bathroom had four separate zones \u2013 shower, bathtub, toilet, and open area with two sinks/mirror. Because of the separate shower and bathtub and the two sinks, it was both nice and convenient for the two of us to be able to bathe and wash up at the same time. The ONLY thing that we truly missed in the room was a coffee/teapot so that we could make our favorite tea that we had brought from home \u2013 since we were staying for 11 nights, having a coffee/teapot in the room would have been a nice benefit. However, even without one, the piano bar personnel, especially Mr. Jose Luis Alcalde who was quite understanding, were kind enough to provide a large teapot of hot water frequently so that we could still enjoy our favorite tea. The ONLY problem we had during our stay was that 3 times during the dead of the night (when we were deep in sleep) the television would \u201cbuzz\u201d/\u201dring\u201d as if some pre-set alarm were going off. After the 1st incident, the hotel repair person came immediately the next morning, checked everything out, but could not find any problem. After the 2nd incident, the front office manager, Mr. Alquilera, had the repair person to change out the television. The 3rd incident was during the night before we were to leave the hotel that morning. To this day, we do NOT KNOW what was going on \u2013 at one point, we laughed between ourselves that perhaps there is a GHOST in the room! Regardless, even this inconvenience 3 nights out of 11 nights did NOT spoil our otherwise truly wonderful stay at the Fira Palace Hotel! However, next time we will make sure NOT to get the same room \u2013 HA! FITNESS CENTER The fitness center was professionally-run and well-equipped \u2013 it had three separate rooms. In the first room, there were exercise mats, exercise bikes, and treadmill, with television to watch. In the second room, there were weight machines primarily for legs and feet. In the third room, there were upper body weight machines, free weights, and pull/dip station. SWIMMING POOL The swimming pool was medium sized and long enough to swim short laps. The pool itself and the surrounding area were very clean. SAUNA IN MEN\u2019S DRESSING ROOM/ SAUNA IN WOMEN\u2019S DRESSING ROOM The sauna was nice, but since we live in Russia and are accustomed to the great \u201cRusskaya banya\u201d the sauna was not sufficiently hot for us. In addition, it would have been really nice to have had the opportunity to experience the sauna TOGETHER \u2013 and, in fact, one time at the end of the night right before closing we tried to accomplish this task, albeit without permission, but were unsuccessful since there was still one other woman in the women\u2019s dressing room! TWO INTERNET STATIONS (ONE IN LOBBY AND ONE DOWNSTAIRS NEAR CONFERENCE ROOMS AND FITNESS CENTER) The two internet stations were well-equipped (even had a printer with paper for guests to print out various information) and consisted of 3 computers at each station. Many hotel guests used the internet stations. Everyone was respectful and did not stay on too long, as we did not ever experience any trouble in finding an available computer to use. Also, IF we had brought our own computer with us, the hotel gives you an internet card that allows you to use the internet in your room (as well as most likely anywhere else in the hotel) for 30 minutes every day free of charge. PIANO BAR AND RESTAURANT The piano bar and restaurant were expensive for us, but this is quite typical for many upper-scale hotels. While we did not order anything from the piano bar, we did try one time the buffet breakfast (18 EUR per person, approx. $ 26 at then exchange rate) at the restaurant. It would be nice for the hotel to consider either offering the buffet breakfast to hotel guests at a more reasonable price and/or giving a significant discount if breakfast is ordered at the time of making the room reservation, especially in instances when longer-term stays are involved (i.e., we stayed 11 nights, and IF we had eaten the buffet breakfast every morning we would have paid 396 EUR or approx. $ 572). Regardless, there are many breakfast places close by (even directly across from the hotel) - we found a place that we really liked on Avenida Paral-lel and for 5 EUR each (approx. $ 7.20) had a truly great (albeit not very dietetic) full breakfast including two eggs, pork loin, toast, coffee, and orange juice. GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF HOTEL As stated above, the hotel is approx. 25 minutes by foot from the city center and approx. 15 minutes by foot from the Maritime Museum and the Barcelona Boardwalk near the port. We enjoy walking, so this distance definitely was a PLUS for us. In addition, we do NOT like large crowds a lot, so for us it was nice to go to the more crowded city center but then to return \u201chome\u201d to a quieter, albeit still interesting, environment. We are also of the opinion that the primary reason Fira Palace Hotel is not a 5-star hotel is because of its less centralized (albeit still quite convenient) location, and this fact obviously is reflected in the hotel\u2019s pricing policy, i.e., IF Fira Palace were in the city center we think that it would be much more expensive to stay at \u2013 thus, hotel guests receive all of the many benefits of a 5-star hotel without having to pay the substantially higher price tag that usually goes along with these benefits. Finally, there are some great restaurants in the area around the hotel that you should definitely consider eating at (see list below). TAXI STAND IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE HOTEL There were ALWAYS taxis waiting directly outside the hotel, ready to take hotel guests anywhere they wanted to go. GOOD RESTAURANTS NEAR THE HOTEL (1) L'Antica Napoli restaurant located at C/Concordia 53 (5 min. walk from hotel) \u2013 EXCELLENT DINNER - great pizza, brezaola, entrecote \u2013 owners are Vanessa (manager) and Mario (chef) who are husband and wife. (2) Basilico restaurant located at Avenida Paral-lel 142 (5 min. walk from hotel) \u2013 GOOD DINNER - www.restaurant-basilico.com . (3) La Bodegueta del Poble Sec restaurant located at C/Blai 47 (10 min. walk from hotel) \u2013 EXCELLENT dinner, great rack of lamb and rabbit \u2013 owner takes pride in his restaurant, which is wonderful - www.labodeguetabcn.com (4) Trobador restaurant located at Rambla Catalunya 2-4 (25 min. walk from hotel) \u2013 EXCELLENT FIXED-PRICE LUNCH at 11 EUR per person (1 alcoholic or soft drink included) - www.grupcacheiro.com or www.cacheirorestaurants.com . (5) Yamamoto restaurant located at C/Arago 197 (between Aribau & Muntaner) (20 min. walk from hotel) - EXCELLENT FIXED-PRICE JAPANESE LUNCH BUFFET of high quality at 9 EUR per person (drink not included) (6) Fresc Co. restaurant located at Ronda Universitat 29 (25 min. walk from hotel) \u2013 GOOD FIXED-PRICE LUNCH AND DINNER BUFFETS with great salad bar and OK hot buffet (1 alcoholic or soft drink included, water free, tea/coffee free) - 9 EUR before 6 p.m., 10 EUR after 6 p.m. - www.fresc.com (has several locations). (7) El Raco restaurant located at Ronda Universitat 11, also one located at Rambla Catalunya 25 \u2013 OK DINNER, GOOD FIXED-PRICE LUNCH at 10 EUR per person (1 alcoholic or soft drink included) - www.elraco.com (has several locations). (8) Chinese Gran Epoca restaurant located at C/Sepulveda 94 (15 min. walk from hotel) \u2013 GOOD DINNER \u2013 www.lagranepoca.com (9) Il Golfo di Napoli restaurant at C/Lerida 38 (out of hotel take immediate right, is on right-hand side next door to hotel) - overpriced, small portions, quality OK \u2013 simply not worth the money compared to other places that we liked much better, BUT if you are really tired one night and simply want to go to a restaurant \u201cright around the corner\u201d you can try it! (10) For those of you who would like to venture out to the \u201csuburbs\u201d of Barcelona in a town called Sant Pere De Ribes (near the town of Sitges), you should definitely try Cervantes Restaurant located at Cervantes 28 and owned and managed by Mr. Andres Gonzalez, tel. 93 896 29 87, EXCELLENT FIXED-PRICE LUNCH - approx. 35 km from Barcelona (easy and inexpensive to get to by train, 2.80 EUR per ticket each way). GROCERY STORE NEAR THE HOTEL There is a reasonably-priced \u201cConsum Basic\u201d grocery store located at C/L Olivera 38 (5 minutes walk from hotel), as well as a grocery store located on Avenida Paral-lel. At Consum Basic, we stocked up on 6-liter jugs of water, apples, nectarines, peaches, etc. OBJECTIVE COMPARISON OF FIRA PALACE HOTEL TO OTHER BARCELONA HOTELS Since we were in Barcelona for 11 nights, we decided to check out other hotels in case we wanted to return to Barcelona but stay at a different hotel (simply for variety). Therefore, we checked out the following hotels (including the hotel rooms, the restaurants, the outdoor pools, the fitness centers, the spas, etc.): (1) Barcelona Universal Hotel located at Avenida Paral-lel 76-80 (www.hotelbarcelonauniversal.com) - nice outdoor pool area, nominal gym, nice room. (2) Barcelo Raval Hotel located at Rambla Raval 19 (www.barceloraval.com) \u2013 nominal outdoor pool, OK gym, nice room, good central location, but area may be somewhat \u201cseedy\u201d and not sure what it is like at night. (3) AC Diplomatic Hotel located at Pau Claris 122 (www.ac-hotels.com) \u2013 small outdoor pool, nominal gym, nice room, great central location. (4) Icaria Hotel located at Avenida Icaria 195 (www.hotelicariabarcelona.com) \u2013 nice outdoor pool, OK gym, nice room, great BEACH location not too far from city center (both Fira Palace Hotel and Icaria Hotel are about the same distance to Plaza Catalunya in the city center, but from different sides of town). (5) Miramar Hotel located at Plaza Carlos Ibanez 3 (www.hotelmiramarbarcelona.com) \u2013 great outdoor pool, good gym, nice room, romantic garden and sea view, unusual location (it is actually in Montjuic Park close to where the cable cars depart to go to San Sebastian beach). Probably either a taxi or use of the city bus or funicular (included in the metro ticket) is necessary to get there (it is a quite steep hill) since otherwise when walking one has to wind around the road going up the steep hill. In our estimation, the only one of the above hotels that we objectively thought would be better than Fira Palace was Miramar Hotel. However, Miramar is significantly more expensive than Fira Palace and is not in as good of a location as Fira Palace. Thus, when taking into consideration a desired balance between price and quality/quantity, Fira Palace still wins out with us in terms of our budget. Also, it should be noted that IF you are interested in combining a city/beach vacation, the Icaria Hotel very nicely allows you to do this.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, Germany", "Title": "\u201cLarge rooms in business hotel close to trade fair\u201d", "Author": "cheftrainer", "ReviewID": "UR119511832", "Content": "This 4 star + hotel has nice large rooms.

The standard room I got was huge and was equipped with two king size beds. The bathroom had both a bathtube as a seperate (massage) shower and a seperate toilet with bidet. Plenty of room to store your stuff around the two wash basins, which is always a plus in my book. Also: enough free electric sockets, allowing you to charge batteries and so on. The room did have its shortcomings in that it is showing signs of age: a cracked tile in the bathroom, the floor to floor carpet is a little worn out, the shower heads spinkle in every direction...

Hotel is located very close to the magic fountain, area was very safe at night, very close to the underground system and very close to the barcelona sightseeing bus stop.

The breakfast was excellent and cost 12 euro/person (incuding tax) - if you only booked the room at 80 euros/night (tax extra) which we did because you cannot eat a breakfast every morning after eating late. We also eat twice in the \"Le Mall\" restaurant which was very good and reasonably priced for the standard of cuisine. They also have a piano bar called Scruples for drinks and cocktails - but we didnt see anyone playing, perhaps they just have this at the weeken and we were staying Sunday to Friday.

We stayed in the hotel two times during the period. The first time was the first 4 days of our trip and we were upgraded from a regular room all the way to a junior suite. The suite is very nice with a huge king size bed in bedroom and a sleep sofa in living room. It also has very large bathroom with bathtub and a separate fancy showing room. We were also grated with a complimentary bottle of wine. The tips is that you need to enroll in the membership of iperfer hotel chain (http://www.iprefer.com/) and book the hotel through their link to get these perks (upgrades, wine and free wireless internet in your room!). The rate offered by their site directly is no worse than any other sites. I paid for 99 Euro/night for all these! The second time we used hotel was 8/25 when we returned from Madrid and ready to go on cruise. We were again upgraded to an executive room which has two large queen beds and received a bottle of wine. In both cases, we have plenty of bed rooms for us (two adults and two young children) to share with. This is not typical in European hotels as you know in most cases the rooms are small and beds are small. Location and transportation: The location is not central but very convenient. Location is not in the busiest tourist area (Las Ramblas street or city center) but is very close to Magic fountain shows (a must see event from Friday night to Sunday night) in National museum area (300 meters from hotel). Airport is a little far but aerobus (3.5 euro) stop is about 1 km away. There is also a bus stop (forgot bus number) right outside of hotel to take you the beginning of the Las Ramblas ( Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya) which they call the city center. The bus ride is about 10 minutes and cost is litter under 1 euro if you buy T10 tickets from airport or any subway station, otherwise you pay 1.4 per ride. The bus runs to about 10:30pm in the night. You can also the metro (subway). The metro (subway) is about 5-7 minutes walking from the hotel to a large street (avinguda del Paral.lel). And if you plan to take cruise during your trip, the hotel is only about 5 km (3 miles) from the cruise terminals. So it\u2019s fantastic for people like us for pre-cruise stay. Facilities and services: hotel has a pretty nice and big lobby area that provides a nice sitting area and 3 sets of computers for free internet access. The inside swimming pool was small and a litter old but enough for our two young draughts to have some fun after busy days walking around the city. Staff: the staffs were nice and professional. Food: I never used hotel restaurant as I think the food was over priced and menu is kind of boring. We ate two times in a restaurant (R\u00edas de Galicia?) and we absolutely loved the snail dish it provides. Overall, I think this is the hotel that not overcharged you with it's quality rooms and services.

Our party stayed in three rooms for four nights. The hotel is situated within easy reach of the airport bus (10 minute walk) and is easy to find. We arrived at 2 pm and our rooms were not ready so we decided to have a drink in the hotel bar. This was the only time we visited the bar because we were shocked at how expensive it was. We have stayed in many hotels and expect the bar prices to be high but 30 euros for four small beers and two soft drinks!! The rooms varied. I think my room was upgraded to an executive and was very pleasant. It had two double beds and a separate shower with modern decor. It had bath robes and slippers, complimentary wine, chocolates and bottled water. However, the other two rooms were much more dated. My sister-in-law had what looked like a suite, however the furniture was old and the wallpaper looked like something from the early eighties so not at all luxurious. The kids loved the pool but it wasn't anything special and a little drab. The location of the hotel was good. The area is very busy on a weekend due to the fountains, which were great. There is a shopping centre nearby (old bull ring) and you can go up to the roof and see views of Barcelona. We ate in a restaurant up there for my birthday. Breakfast at the hotel was great. You could even have champagne, which we did on the day of my birthday. Staff were pleasant and only to happy to provide us with plates and a knife to cut up my birthday cake.

If you don't want to spend a lot of Euro for taxi or airport shuttle (\u20ac25 at least)to this hotel, you can take the express airport bus to the center of Madrid. The first stop is Plaza de Espana. There is a tourist kiosk across the street, there she can direct you to the hotel. Really only few blocks. The express airport bus cost \u20ac2.50!!!! the bus has luggage racks. Just ask the tourist info how to catch the bus. There are Also signs how to get to the bus. Now to go back to the airport if you have plenty of time, you can also catch the public bus around the corner from the hotel. We found this by accident while checking out the nearby local restaurants near the hotel. This one has some stop public bus but cost \u20ac1.20 it is bus 66. Make a left from leida( front of the hotel) then another left towards main street and you will see the bus stops. Look for #66. Now back to the hotel.Overall this is a very nice hotel. Spacious.

It is NOT far away from the Barri Gotic or other areas, by metro. You take a short walk through the neighborhood of Poble Sec (which has several really good restaurants and the Mercat de les Flors with its dance and music performances) to the metro, get on with your 10T pass good for 10 rides, and in a very short time you can be anywhere in the city.

Very big rooms.\u201d", "Author": "fter", "ReviewID": "UR85816298", "Content": "I chose this hotel mainly because of the large standard room size, as we have two small children. The room entirely matched the description and pictures - very large - around 42sq.m. - with 2 queen-size beds and a sofabed. It would be easily possible to sleep 3 or 4 kids in this room. The location was also fine for us, 3 minutes walk from the magic fountain and at the foot of Montjuic, although if you prefer to be near nightlife you would probably be better staying near La Rambla or the seafront. Metro station less than 10 minutes walk and same distance to bus stops which can bring you to all the main tourist locations. (I read some reviews describing this as a long distance... I disagree, it was a pleasant walk and not far). So in summary, we were very satisfied here and would definitely return next time. Summary of plusses and minuses below. For us the minuses were unimportant but I list them anyway: + Very big room, great for family + Great location for magic fountain, Montjuic attractions + bathroom has separate shower and bath, shower and toilet have own translucent glass doors - good for a little privacy with a number of people in the room + door separating bedroom area and entrance/bathroom area - good to keep out any noise from the corridor for example + very good exercise room and weights room, it seems open to public too but I didn't see it ever busy. Swimming pool is about 15m, pool is plain but kids had a lot of fun there. + Staff polite and helpful + small little things like complimentary iced water in the lobby when we arrived, complimentary coffee in the morning. + 6 internet stations, no charge - this was really good, I haven't seen this at other hotels + Good bakery across the road, open from 6am, open Sundays and holidays too. - Swimming pool not a fancy spa. A lot of kids there on the weekend and no supervision so noisy and lot of splashing which might not suit some people. - wifi only free 30 minutes per day - kids 7 years and over should pay a supplement of 21 Eur per day. Our kid is just 7 and we negotiated out of this. - Not near nightlife or seafront, if that's what you want. - Limited number of good restaurants nearby (but there are restaurants of various levels, so you won't be hungry... just that it doesn't compare with La Rambla or seafront in terms of options). - Breakfast is expense, we didn't take it - ate at the bakery across the road or cafes instead. - TV is spanish channels only. We didn't come to a hotel to watch TV, but you might. Other: * It was very quiet when we stayed. Might be much busier if there is a conference on nearby at the FIRA Barcelona centre. * Didn't eat at restaurant.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vestal, NY", "Title": "\u201cWould stay there again\u201d", "Author": "The4pains", "ReviewID": "UR84396906", "Content": "Very nice hotel in Barcelona, a little bit out of the way to get to the City Center.

We travel a great deal and this hotel was a joy. I had contacted them ahead of our arrival to confirm our request for two double beds, and spoke with Sergio who was very polite and assured us everything would be perfect. We had booked the standard room and upon arrival, were pleasantly surprised to find that we had been upgraded to a suite, complete with a lovely bottle of wine! It was at the end of a hallway and incredibly quiet, with double windows, great AC, enormous rooms, spotless, all sorts of amenities (shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath, sewing kit, shoe kit, toothbrush and paste, slippers, soaps, lotions, razor and shaving cream, and robes for our use during the visit.) We didn't use the wet bar although there was one. There was a great terrace with chairs, and lots of storage space for our clothes and luggage. The space was even better than in the hotel photos on their website and usually it's the opposite! There were two bathrooms. The first, which you could enter from both the bedroom and living room, had a double sink and large shower (also with soap in a dispenser). From there, you entered the second room, which had a toilet, a bidet and a large, deep soaking tub.... just perfect for after a day of walking around Barcelona. Both areas where quite large, very clean and the towels of good quality. There was always plenty of kleenix and TP and everything that we used was restocked daily. The hotel has two shifts of chambermaids so there is no problem having your room made up if you want to sleep late. There are double heavy curtains so the rooms can stay dark until you want to get up. There is an ice machine and cups on the third floor. We didn't use the pool or gym but the facilities looked very secure and clean. The lobby has two levels and they each have three computers and the main lobby also has a printer. The bar was great, uncrowded, and we had a terrific bartender named Pedro who couldn't have been more charming and accommodating. I wanted to try Cava and he just opened a bottle so I could taste it. Another night we tried some Spanish brandy and it was delicious. The beers were always icy cold. In the morning, if you didn't want the full breakfast, you could just have a (very delicious) coffee in the bar. We didn't eat the hotel breakfast and instead found a wonderful bakery right across the street and about three or four stores up that had coffee to go and chilled chocolate milk for our daughter. There is also an excellent Italian restaurant on the same block (go out the door and take a right) called Il Golfo di Napoli where you can eat or do take out. We ended up eating there twice and it seemed full of locals. The hotel is very conveniently located, with easy access to the Metro (Espana) a 10 minute walk away. It is also a breeze from the airport. Just take the Aerobus (#46) and Espana is the first stop, about 20 minutes. We purchased round-trip tickets and saved even more. Check in and check out were fast. Whenever I had a question someone at the front desk answered it quickly, everyone spoke English that I encountered and they were happy to print out a map with directions if you needed it. There is a nice little gift shop with quality items, competitively priced and the lady wraps them beautifully. You can easily walk to the terrific fountain/iight show at night (Thurs-Sun) at Montjuic (two blocks) as well as the museum, the Olympic area and Poble Espanyol where we saw a fabulous flaminco show at El Tablao de Carmen. The only two things I would have liked would have been clocks in the rooms (we brought our own) and somewhere on the premises to get a soda or quick snack that you could take back to your room.

We also called for a bellperson to come help us with the bags. A handsome man and those shiny dress shoes showed up 30 minutes later and before room service brought up breakfast. We thought that the hotel was busy. It was not really. He was the only bellperson in the hotel. Once down in the lobby, we saw other families leaving for the ship. EXCITING! 30 minutes later, we were checked out. But where was the bellperson with our bags? Nowhere to be found! Oh!

We complain and got a better room but the smell was not all gone. This is realy bad for a 4 star hotel. They should kontrol the room to see if everything is ok before giving it to a traveler. -The water in the shower was either too cold or too warm. -The location of the hotel is far a way from city and metro. You must walk a long way or take a cab. -The breakfast is the worst I have ever had in a 4*hotel. The bread was hard and old. Not a lot of thing to select from. For 17 Euro, it was a rip off. You can get a clean and good breakfast in the city fot 15 euro. ex at fargie. The conclusion is that this hotel is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in in europe. Don't be fooled by the nice pictures.

Lots of cheeses, hot and cold meats, eggs, fish, breads, yogurts, cereals, fruits, nuts, dried fruits, truly amazing dessert/cakes, tea, coffee,(filtered), herbal teas - fabulous! So I would say if you can manage to feast yourself at that hour, it is well worth it. They serve up to 10.30, so really that will keep you going for all the sightseeing and shopping you will have to look forward to. The restaurant La Mall I think it's called, was outstanding on our first night, and excellent value \u20ac28 for three courses and coffee. My husband is coeliac and that was no problem , they even had special bread. They made one small error which was quickly fixed and two glasses of Cava were rpodued immediately with an apologetic flourish. Very good. The second time however not so good. The veg incinerated, the dessert cold in spots, hot in other spots (!!) and there was some confusion over the bill. However, when we addressed this with the manager next day, the cost of this meal was waived. Very good again. There was a problem with odour of sewage in our bathroom the first night and when we complained about it they said they would send up a technician immediately. And when she arrived, in her pretty maids apron , with her bottle of bleach, I knew we were in trouble.. We complained again the next day and were swiftly upgrading to a suite which was fabulous.(room 450) . 6 people would easily sleep in that bed, two wardrobes, balcony, separate bathroom and shower room, ,living room - great. And very very peaceful with a wonderful view.The beds in both rooms were divinely comfortable - which for me is firm , no middle sags and no spring noises. The metro is very close, and as others have said other restaurants are nearby and the wonderful fountain exhibit which appears to be nightly is two mins walk away - in fact we could just about see it from our first room. There is free broadband in the foyer, the bar is pleasant and there is a cordoned off indoor smoking area. The pool is appalling, the photos are most deceptive. There were two miniature saunas in the ladies changing room , both out of order. The pool is tiny, no natural light and has a public pool from the 70's feel (and sound) to it. However I believe the hotel is upgrading so perhaps they'll deal with that. It's an eye/ear sore. So while we had little problems, the manner in which they were dealt with by the manager was swift and professional.

The rooms were very spacious and offered great comfort. Particulary the bathroom with separate shower, toilet and bathtube was impressing. The beds were not quite so impressing. I think this is the hardest bed I have ever slept in. I'm a heavy person and need a hard mattress, but this one was directly uncomfortable. However, when we asked at the front desk, they were wery helpful, and gave us some extra soft mattresses on top, and after that the bed was OK. The swimming pool and especially the fitness senter was exellent. We particulary liked the piano bar with a very nice bartender who served one of the best Irish coffees we've ever tasted. (and we are very hard to please when it comes to Irish Coffee) We often took a foredrink in the bar before we went for dinner in the town. We did not eat at the hotel, but was recommended the Port Olympic area for their excellent seafood restaurants. We did not regret that. The first evening we went to \"La Taberna Gallega de Marcos\" What an experience - and speak of value for money! Excellent - nothing more to say! But beware: Barcelona restaurants are quite agressive in their efforts to entice you into their place. We liked \"La Taberna Gallega de Marcos\" so much that we decided to go back some evenings later, but we were almost \"forced\" into an adjacent restaurant . It looked almost the same, but the menus was not as good, and it was also far more expensive. So be shure you choose the right one - no matter the pressure and temptation from others. But back to the Hotel. The location was great for us. We prefer a spacious and comfortable hotel, and are prepared to sacrifice a little on location to achieve this. But this hotel was only a few minutes walk from Placa de Espagna with metro and loads of busses for all over Barcelona, so it was no sacrifice. Tha taxi was typical 7-8 euros from La Ramblas or Port Olympic.

At check-in, the person on duty was very courteous and helpful and gave us an overview of the city, along with a Metro map and suggested good sites to see for first-timers. Then, the next day, we asked a question of the person on duty and got attitude and unhelpful directions to an ATM. I guess it just depended on who was working. Then, on check-out, I was informed we had a charge for breakfast (to the tune of 34 euros). Only thing is, we never had breakfast there. It's very expensive (like $25 for eggs and toast). I said I never had breakfast at the restaurant, and kudos to the person checking me out, because upon not finding a signed bill by me, she removed the charge. So double check your charges at checkout! We stayed for 4 days (we slept in late on the first day due to jet lag). Our shower the first morning had NO hot water. Not a good start! However, the next day when we woke early, we had hot water. I guess, early birds get the hot water here. Location is nice in that it is away from La Rambla and very quiet at night. The downside is that the walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors if they are loud, if you know what I mean. The other downside is that you have to take the Metro or a Taxi to get to most of the best attractions in Barcelona. A cab ride was typically 5-6 Euros to get from the Hotel to La Rambla, which is a good starting point to see a lot of great sites. If you are into walking, it can be done but it's time consuming if you have time constraints or want to see as much as possible while there. I would prefer to stay closer to the attractions next time I travel to Barcelona, even if it means dealing with noise.

We mainly selected the hotel because it was rated family friendly in the Fodor's Guide. We foud it to be very spacious. The room was large and had two queen size beds. The bathroom had a separate shower and an enclosed toilet both with individual doors and a soaking tub. The shower was good once we figured out how to adjust the water temperature. The hotel had several computers in the mail lobby and the conference center in the basement. These were free. There is a restaurant across from the reception area and two bars. Unlike hotels in US the restaurant does not allow you to carry food (coffe etc) to your room. They have to deliver it. One can buy coffee and pastry at the bar and carry to the room but you get cups and saucers and carry a tray. No disposables. The food was very expensive. It cost us close to 15 euros for three cups of coffee and thrree danishes. This is much cheaper outside but in our case we needed to have that first cup in the morning before stepping out. We ate at the restauarant once and found the service very good. The food was acceptable not great. We reached the hotel at 8 AM and were told that the room will be available at noon even though the normal check in is at 3 PM. We spent about three hours walking in the neighborhood that had a Museum and the 1992 Olympics structures. We got our room at 11.30 AM. The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle. If you like quiete this is the palce. It is only five minutes walk from the Espanol metro and a train station. We had no problem visiting many sites around the city. Ther are several maps (restaurants, shopping, etc) available free in the lobby. The servers and other staff in the hotel were impeccably dressed. Few spoke English. We took taxi from the Airport since we did not want to drag our suit cases. It only cost us around 23 euros. We took taxies several times on an average paying under ten euros for the trip. We took all precautions to safeguard our money. I had a windbreaker with an inside zipper pocket. But we did not feel threatened or come across any situations. We had a great time. The tapas and the paeas are great. You should visit Bercada ( I may not have the spelling right) off the La Rambals. It is the fruit and vegetable market. very colorfull with several tapas palaces where you have to stand and wait for yout turn for a seat. Many need cash. I was glad I carried a copy of my passport all the time. Many establishments, including the train station, wanted to see it to accept my credit card.

After arriving at the airport we knew we could get the airport bus to around the corner from the hotel which we did and after a short walk we entered the hotel. The area around the hotel didn't have a very nice feel and was a bit run down. We went to reception and was met with a unfriendly male receptionist who after booking us in turned away and went about his business and didn't offer for our bags to be taken up - no maps or brochures of the area as we'd been offered in other hotels. Anyway we checked in the room and it was quite large and had two double beds in and seemed fine. No tea/coffee facilities and bathroom was large with usual complimentory shampoos/shower gels etc but had a funny smell as though it hadn't been cleaned properly. The first nights sleep was awful as the beds were like rocks with springs in them and I ended up sleeping on the floor as they were so bad!! My husband had an aching back the next day and we went into breakfast. The breakfast was ok - if you like lukewarm eggs. Now I know this sounds as though I am being ultra fussy but we travel quite a bit and have not really had complaints about anywhere we have stayed but was not happy with this hotel at all seeing as it is a five star hotel. We decide too stay one more night and then the next day went to reception and checked out. We were going to be staying for one week but I just didn't want to stay any longer. The receptionist didn't ask why we were checking out and we just left and took a taxi to Hotel Pullman Skipper which is situated around the corner from the beach. We have stayed here before and it's a lovely hotel, The difference in the service was fantastic - offer of bags to be taken to room and brochures and maps given and the lady on reception remembered us from when we were there in June.

The free internet in the lobby was a big plus, since we used it extensively to plan what to do in the city. You can get a card from the concierge everyday which gives you access to 30 min of free wireless in your hotel room, but remember to bring your european power adapter so that you can actually charge your laptop! The location was great for our purposes. It was a 5-10 minute walk to Placa Espanya, where you can catch several city trains as well as the train to Montserrat (where we took a day trip). Placa Espanya also has an Information kiosk where you can find helpful advice during the day. There are also a number of buses within walking distance, including buses that take you directly to the beach or to the Ramblas. The hotel is located at the foot of Montjuic and convenient to all the museums and attractions in the park (e.g., MNAC, Fundacio Joan Miro). The Magic Fountain is less than a 5 minute walk straight down the street from the hotel and should not be missed! We never took a taxi the entire time (6 nights) we were in Barcelona. There are plenty of small cafes, bakeries and tapas restaurants near the hotel, and the Hostafrancs Marketplace is a 15min walk (or one train stop) from the hotel, where you can find all your grocery items, as well as cheap wine. Hostafrancs is a smaller version of the main Boqueria at Las Ramblas, but you'll find things like Iberian Jamon for half the price. La Fruiteria is catty-corner from the hotel, where you can find reasonably priced local art and very well priced wine from the Rioja and Basque wine regions. Perhaps, the one drawback is that the hotel is in a quieter area, so if you're interested in being directly on the beach or off the Ramblas/Passeig de Gracia, or having a ton of chic restaurants and bars on your doorstop, it is not ideal.

The Plaza d'Espanya stop is closest to the hotel: instead of heading down Ave Ma Cristina and left on Ave Rius i Taulet, we found it easier to go down Ave de Paral-lel and take a right at Lleida. The hotel is at the corner of Lleida and Rius i Taulet. There are several small restaurants in the area, all catering to the locals. Have some churros con chocolate for breakfast at this little restaurant diagonally across from the gas station on Paral-lel and Lleida. For lunch or a quick snack order a \"bikini\" at any of the sandwich shops. Have assorted tapas and paella for dinner at the Xop d'Or on Paral-lel. If you want Thai food walk 20 mins from the hotel to Thai Thai (Carrer de la Diputacio near Viladomat). To explore Barcelona we found it cheaper to buy the T-10 Metro passes since there was just 3 of us. Because people had warned us about pickpockets we didn't bring much stuff around except for bottled water and a camera, just taking small amounts of cash, an ATM &/or credit card and a drivers license. Be sure to walk around and enjoy all that Barcelona has to offer: good food and wine, and beautiful architecture. Some extra tips: 1. Use your ATM card instead of bringing a large amount of dollars or travelers checks. You can get a better rate even with the conversion fees and ATM charges. There is an ATM at the airport lobby just before you exit the airport, and there are ATMs all over the city. Select the UK flag to read the directions in English. Unlike US ATMs, those in Europe will not give you a receipt unless requested. 2. Make sure to know your credit card PIN and bring your drivers license. As a security feature many places will request a PIN to complete a CC transaction (e.g. using the Metro's ticket kiosk) or will require photo ID. 3. Buy large bottles of water (1 to 3-liter) from corner stores or El Corte Ingles (there's a huge branch at Plaza Catalunya) and fill your smaller bottles from them. 4. Be prepared to walk. Some famous sites are far from the Metro stations (ex. Parc Guell is actually nearer to the Vallcarca station but it is a very steep climb, even with the occasional escalator).", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Markham, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel! Great Location!\u201d", "Author": "Ytinerec", "ReviewID": "UR39458902", "Content": "I had the chance to stay at this hotel prior to our recent family cruise vacation. It was absolutely great. First of all, location: The hotel is located within walking distance of the Spanish Village, Museum Catalonia, and the Musical Fountain. It is also very close to a major hub of the Barcelona Metro subway system (Espanya station). This makes it really easy to get to popular places like Sagrada Familia, Las Ramblas, etc. We felt this was really important to us and thats why we originally picked this hotel. Second, the service and amenities: The service here was incredible. From the helpful greeters to the friendly front desk, we never had an issue. The front desk was very helpful in recommending some places to eat, and directions to the Metro / sightseeing places on the first day we arrived. The amenities were very good. There is a medium sized pool that we used, and a buffet breakfast is available at an extra coast. The lobby was very spacious and professional looking. The amenities were tailored more towards a business traveller. Lastly the room: Our room was their \"Standard Room\". The room is VERY spacious by European standards. Their website touts their rooms as the biggest in the city, and after staying in one, I'd believe it! The size is comparable or even bigger than a standard North American room. Ours had 2 queen size beds, a sofa, a business desk. The bathroom was very large as well. The window soundproofing was very good. We did not feel like the noise from the street bothered us at all. Overall a very spacious and high quality room by even North American standards that is close to tourist attractions and transportation hubs. The only downside i could think of was that the price was a little high, but compared to the place we stayed at post-cruise, my mom said it best: \"I'd rather pay a bit extra and stay at Fira\"", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel right in the city\u201d", "Author": "Angela0402", "ReviewID": "UR38817502", "Content": "We are a family of two adults and a 10 year old.

The lobby of the hotel is beautiful and offered free internet access. Our room was super clean. We had two double beds and one pull out single bed with more than enough room to spare. Barcelona is a fantastic city. Everyone should travel there at least once. We felt very safe and often wandered around until about 11pm without incident.

The bathroom amenities were good quality, with everything you need. The bed was large, but I found it quite hard and didn't sleep as well as I would've liked. There was a large TV, but the remote control did not work for it. Or actually it worked but in a completely random fashion.

The hotel is located outside the main tourist part of Barcelona. It is not well located for Las Ramblas or the old town, but is right next to Mont Juic and the Olympic park. It is convenient to the convention centers too. Tthere is a metro station about 5 minutes walk away which will take you into the center of town pretty quickly (Espanya). Walking downtown would probably take about 30 minutes minimum. The staff at the hotel were friendly and courteous with pretty good English.

We picked this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews, hotel price and availability. We would normally have looked for something a bit closer to the city centre but we got a good deal with the room rate and the close proximity of the metro meant that the main centre was only 10-15 minutes from the hotel (including a 5 minute walk to the metro station at Placa Espanya). Hotel Location: The hotel is situated approximately 5 minutes walk from Placa Espanya and the National Palace and only 3 minutes from the Magic Fountain. The area surrounding the hotel is a mixture of residential and commercial (theatres and museums being the main thing) but not very much in the way of shops. There are small bars (anyone for Tapas) all over Barcelona and the area surrounding the hotel is no different. There is a good restaurant next door to the hotel on Carrer de Lleida. The reservation: We booked the room directly through the hotel website as I prefer to deal directly with hotels rather than through third-party booking agencies. Making the reservation was easy and we quickly received email confirmation of our booking. Although check-in is from 3:00 pm our room was ready when we arrived at midday. Check-in: No problems with check-in. Our room was ready and within a few minutes we were unpacking. The room: We opted for a suite as our daughter is only 5 years of age and we expected to be spending quite a lot of time in the room, particularly in the evening. The suite was split into a large lounge/office/dining area, a separate bedroom and a large bathroom. The decor was fine although the room didn't get very much daylight. The room had a balcony overlooking the side street with a table and a couple of chairs but didn't get any sunshine as it was recessed into the main building. There was a big flat screen television although the English-speaking channels seemed to be limited to news only. The room had a safe (always a good thing to have) but no coffee or tea making facilities that I could find. There was a minibar although we never used it. Overall we were very pleased with the room. Hotel services: The hotel had a health club with a gym and swimming pool. We used the swimming pool a couple of times and it was generally quiet. The pool and changing rooms were functional and clean so no complaints there. The only other service we used was the hotel restaurant. Our daughter opted for bread and a fruit salad as there was nothing else on the menu that she wanted. My meal of baby lamb chops was disappointing both in quality and quantity. My wife opted for the mushroom lasagna which was really more starter size than a main course although she did enjoy it. Throw in a portion of tiramisu, a portion of profiteroles (2 Euros per profiterole!!!!), a couple of coffees, a couple of bottles of beer and a glass of coke and the final bill of over 80 Euros looked very steep for a fairly average meal. We would have probably used room service for some snacks but the eye-watering prices left us heading for local shops. Not only can you expect to pay 15 Euros or more for an omelette and only a couple of Euros less for some cheese sandwiches but the hotel also adds on a delivery charge of 3 Euros. Housekeeping did a great job of keeping the room clean and tidy during our stay with chocolates left on the bed every evening. High points: This was our first visit to Barcelona and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there. Easter may not have been the best time of year to visit as it seemed really busy (too busy for me) around the main attractions and with a young child we weren't prepared to queue for a significant length of time. The metro system was really easy to use and we simply bought a 10 journey ticket each which lasted us for the entire stay. There are plenty of sights to see and loads of places to eat and drink. Low points: In some areas of the city, particularly around La Ramblas and some of the narrow alleys down towards Port Vell, I didn't feel completely safe. We didn't run into any trouble but a woman sat at a table near us in one outside bar went to pay the bill only to find that her bag had been stolen. Conclusion: The Fira Palace hotel is a good place to stay if you want somewhere slightly out of the main tourist areas but within easy reach of the centre of the city. If I return to Barcelona I will definitely consider staying at this hotel again.", "Date": "April 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochefort en Terre, France", "Title": "\u201cA big room is not everything...........\u201d", "Author": "deborahFrance", "ReviewID": "UR26735570", "Content": "I booked this hotel for its position - 5 mins. from the Magic Fountain (and it was magic) and because the rooms were large.

It was 16 euros and well worth the price. It had hot and cold cereals, eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, tortilla espanola (Spanish potato and onion omelet/fritatta), fresh fruit, yogurt, etc. It was enough that we didn't feel the need to eat lunch.

Room was very large and very clean with a well stocked bathroom with his & her sinks, separate shower and separate toilet areas. Large wide screen television, but still the only English channels were BBC World News, CNN and sport channel. The bed was a super king size, but although we slept very well (partly due to the excellent black-out curtains and lack of street noise) the mattress was quite hard. Didn't have breakfast which was 16 Euros per person. We took a travel kettle with us and bought juice and croissants locally. Used the hotel pool which was good, but didn't have time to use the gym. The Espanya Metro stop was an easy and pleasant walk from the hotel, being alongside the Magic Fountains (these are not in use from the end of September so we didn't get to see them). Barcelona is a large and busy city, but the Metro is a quick and fairly easy way of getting around. We bought T10 tickets which cost E7.50 and give you 10 journeys per ticket and can also be used on the bus (the No 46 takes you directly to the airport from Pl Espanya). Would recommend a visit to Park Guell (which is free) and also the Olympic complex which is within walking distance of the hotel. We didn't have time to see everything, but managed to see the main places of interest.

Secondly, they sometimes launch reduced rates on their web site. So you can find yourself staying in a room for 131euros with your neighbor paying only 97 euros. Thirdly, when I booked this year we asked for a superior room. On arrival we were placed in what turned out to be a standard room. Now having been there before we knew that it was a standard room so I contacted reception. I checked on the room rate first and they confirmed that I was paying the superior room price.

The standard rooms are quite like what you see on its actual webpage so all in all, pretty pleasant. Again, location was excellent and I enjoyed the breakfast buffet which has an excellent spread. Rooms are spacious and well stocked with toiletries and towels (the massage shower in my room did not work very well though but still it was alright). However, a few things happened that have coloured my perception of this place. So much so that I'm writing this in my room in the hotel! Firstly, when I checked in, I noticed that the dates shown on the check-in card did not match the dates I had on my travel coupon (booked via a travel agent). When queried, the staff insisted that their dates were correct and because my travel agent amended the booking, my agent must have gotten the new set of dates wrong (2 nights less). The part that ticked me off was that they did not offer to try to resolve the situation for me. They simply told me to contact either my agent or the company handling their website reservations and that was it. However I did not believe that such a big mistake could have been made by my agent and only upon being very firm, did they go through all the hoops one would expect of a supposedly 4* hotel service to try to check what went wrong. Turns out they did not update their logs hence put the wrong information into their system!! But I did not get any apology, just a, \"no, no you are right\" in what I perceived as a semi-grudging way. Coming up to the room, there was a particular fried dough smell in the bathroom and only by opening the door to the room did it kind of fade away but every time you closed the door you could smell it. I presume it's from the restaurant downstairs (I was on the mezzanine level)? On other levels, you can smell it along the corridor. They clearly need to work on their air filtration system! The Wi-Fi internet service is not free but the price is reasonable (10,50Euros for 24 hours). However, the connection speed is variable (at one point being very, very slow) and the connection itself is very unstable. Once, the connection just died and I was unable to re-connect to the wi-fi spot despite multiple tries (my time was still ticking here). So again, I rang up reception who was slightly more helpful and claimed that the network was fine. However, the end result was the same as when I checked-in - that I had to ring the company providing the internet! Surely they would be able to check on my behalf given that it was a pretty simple problem. At the end of it, there also was no offer to extend my usage time to compensate for the time wasted. I rang the company myself and although the staff I spoke to claims the number is free, I will be very, very unimpressed if I get billed for it! Also, if they charge me for two \"extra\" nights from the check-in fiasco, I will be well ticked off.

I thought this a bit odd as i have stayed in my fair share of hotels and everyone from the very expensive to low budget have supplied these. It's a small thing but in the morning or after a day of sightseeing, to be able to make your own hot drink would be nice instead of having to go to cafes or the hotel bar all the time. The second issue i had was that without realising i had booked a rate without breakfast. Eating breakfast at the hotel is a crazy 15 euros per person! For business travellers this would be ok, but for leisure, no chance! Therefore another inconvenience of having to find somewhere to have breakfast each day. Luckily there are lots of nice cafes nearby the Espanya Metro station whwere you can get tea and croissant for less that 10 euros for 3 people! Sorry to ramble on. All in all the stay at the hotel was very nice. It just would have been better with the above not being issues.", "Date": "December 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "York, UK", "Title": "\u201cLuxury Stay - The very best!\u201d", "Author": "YorkieAl", "ReviewID": "UR10495958", "Content": "My girlfriend and I just returned from a 4-day (three nights) short break to Barcelona, we booked the Fira Palace online , got a rate of \u00a3210 and were delighted with the results.

Taxi's wait outside the hotel ALL DAY and the main metro staion Espanya is a five minute walk, from there you can reach any part of the City in under 15 minutes. Personally I wouldnt like to stay on La Ramblas is it's a little crazy on a night. HOTEL The building itself is lush! Huge, marble floors, three elevators and the interior just screams class! We didnt use the leisure facilites or the bar but both looked very nice (altough I'm told its very expensive) . ROOMS As a 24-year old I've not had the luxury of experiencing such high standards before, this blew my socks off! The room's are HUGE, two kingsize beds, big screen LCD flat TV, minibar ( expensive but not as bad as I'd expect ) and plenty of wardrobe space. The Bathrooms are a class above too; twin sinks, shaving mirror, seperate bath, beday, and the shower is one of those 'hydroshowers' which has jets comeing from the sides as well as from the shower head above!

It turned out that the location of the conference was quite a distance away, but since I wasn't attending (and he was there for only one day), I didn't mind. I had been a little concerned about the hotel's location being away from the \"action\", and while it's true, you're not in the center of the City near the star attractions, I liked that it wasn't in the thick of things. Barcelona's metro system is fantastic, and we took it everywhere. It took about 10 min to get to Placa de Catalunya. And you're about 150 m away from the Magic Fountain and Montjuic and all that it offers. Coming from one night at the Barceo Sants, I can say the Fira Palace is infinately better: the rooms are quite large for Barcelona standards, the washrooms are huge. The staff at reception were very helpful in suggesting restaurants to us, which was no easy feat due to La Merce Festival that week (restaurants were either booked solid or closed for the holiday). The elevators did break down a couple of times while we were there (and the staff seemed lost in what to do), but other than that no complaints.

The hotes is very near the Sants train station, which was handy, but complicated traffic systems meant that what would be a short walk was a much longer drive. the hotel is situated in a fairly working-class residential area close to the Parallel street. Evening walking in the area felt slightly scary. The entrance lobby to the hotel is huge, with a real 5 star appearance. There is a tiny gift shop which is actually not too bad for last minute trinkets etc, though the very nice sales assistant took absolutely ages rummaging around for gift wrap to wrap each individual gift; nice touch but too too slow. The check in/out was slow, with very impersonal & uninterested staff. Lifts up to the room were a little slow, & the room we had (supposedly a slight upgrade from standard) was at the end of very long corridors. The room was very spacious, as advertised. The room had 2 queen size beds, which posed a bit of a problem. When I mentioned this to reception they seemed unwilling to do anything for us, though I did not push the issue. A queen size bed (about 4 foot wide I think) isn't big enough for my partner & I to sleep in comfortably, being used to standard double at least (4 foot 6 inches) or our own king size (5 foot wide). The other bed was for my son. So over the three nights we experimented with the format. Overall, though the beds were individually very comfortable, this was not satisfactory. The Bathroom, and indeed the hotel overall, looked like it had been built/designed in the 70's as a 5* luxury hotel, but now although not too shabby it does feel a little dated. The shower was merely satisfactory. The toiletries were ok. The minibar was full of the usual highly priced items which I refuse to purchase. There was a bottle of water (bizarrely, from Norway) on the bedside locker, looked more like a bottle of aftershave. This had a price sticker on it of 2.80 Euro. The chambermaids were a little too enthusiastic about arriving early, and knocked several times before we had gone out of the room for the day. Also, during our three days there we had two separate incidents of staff walking in unannounced while we were in the room. Despite the mini hallway entry to the room with a second door, the carpeted coridor seemed to produce a lot of noisy people & staff banging doors etc. We tried out the pool on one occasion. Tthis is in the hotel but is part of a separate gym which is open to the public members. The pool looked like any municipal pool, but was fine; no-one but us in it at the time. We didn't eat in the hotel at all, but there was a nice enough restaurant about 20 yards from the hotel front door. I can't remember the name of it, but beside it was a fairly expensive fish restaurant that looked great but was full when we tried to eat there. Checking out was painfully slow, but we were able to leave our bags in the storage facility while we did some more sightseeing, we collected our luggage later (had to queue again) & asked the porter to get us a taxi. This involved him standing out in the street trying to see if he could hail one, which took a good 5 minutes & we could have probably done this ourselves.

(The worst I saw was a comment about the rock-hard beds - quite accurate but manageable). However, those reviews fail to capture some real problems here, particularly for the business traveler. First, the gymnasium opens at 9 am, precisely the time that your meetings will have begun, so don't bother packing the sneakers and shorts. Second, room service (other than light fare) is available on a very limited \"restaurant style\" schedule - open only for several hours in late afternooon and late evening, and is closed all other times. Besides that, the menu offerings are incredibly limited, and unacceptable for a city business hotel. Third, English is not spoken by a large percentage of the staff, which is fine for meetings of local travelers but doesn't work well for an international gathering. I could go on and on, but will spare you the details. What's more, the staff and management were entirely unapologetic for these shortcomings, and seemed to suggest that the issues cited were perfectly reasonable, at least for the Spanish business traveler.

Two days before we left the listed rates had dropped to 99 Euros including breakfast. I emailed the hotel and requested the new rate. They did not answer my email. When we arrived I discussed this with the front desk, and was told tough luck, too bad, 72 hour cancellation if you don't like it you will be charged half of your three nights at the original rate. So walking out wasn't really an option. With regard to other requests, the front desk staff were not very knowledgeable. The gondola at the waterfront is closed for a while for renovations....after reading something that alluded to this, but hearing the front desk recommend it to another patron we asked. This guy said he didn't know and because it was a holiday, there was no way to find out (from any other staff or any other means). Ok? The last morning the girl on the front desk kindly circled where to catch the airport bus (5 min walk)...too bad it was the wrong place....we spotted the bus stopped around the corner from where she directed us. Oi. To top it all off, arriving home there was an email message from the hotel hoping that we had enjoyed our stay and welcoming and comments or questions. So they will email uselessness in the name of providing \"the best service\", but they won't answer your email if you are asking them to honor the best rate available two days before arrival. My advice, don't book far ahead, or if you do, recheck the rate 73 hours before and if it's much better, cancel and rebook. That would have saved us 90 euros!

Rather than rant on, I'll list the most important points you'll no doubt want to read! * Location - Adequate. Certainly not central, but it is in a safe area and within easy reach of everywhere you want to go in Barcelona. It is right next to the Fountains at Montjuic, which was breathtaking at night, especially having explored the city by day. I would say the only reason for staying closer would be if you *hate* any kind of walking or if you are elderly or have a disability. Public transport is so close, you can get anywhere you like within 20 minutes. The beach is around 25 minutes' walk away. The airport is a 20 minute taxi ride. * Staff - Reasonable. While they will not exactly fall over themselves to help you (and some seem to take their time), they still meet expected standards. Always a pleasant 'hello' to greet you, which was a nice touch. * Cleanliness - Excellent. Always clean, tidy and well presented, although the legendary 'Spanish drain' smell was there. Ah, you get used to it...after all, you're in Barcelona! * Price - Exceptional. Great value for money, especially when booked through the hotel's website. Will always upgrade when they can (which happened to us and 4 other couples we knew on the weekend)! * Rooms - Definitely some of the biggest I have stayed in. While they have the usual 4-Star feel (you know what I'm talking about), there just seems to be more of it. Bigger beds, more comfortable sofas, more furniture; the room was definitely not without. The 5th floor view over Barcelona was good; I'd advise you to ask for this. * Breakfast - Good. I really enjoyed the variety, having stayed at many far worse 4-Star hotels. Worth investing if you like eating, they usually serve until 10:30! ***Overall: an excellent, clean hotel with a friendly relaxed atmosphere, you cannot help but feel that the Fira is slightly set apart from its other 4-Star peers.
