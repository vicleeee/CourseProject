Like its location, which is neither near the city nor the airport, the basic, depressing design, the run-down furnishings, the hot and stuffy room, the sad pillows that flatten completely when you lay your head on them such that you might as well lay your head directly on the bed, the CRT TV from the 90's, the small bathroom with its inconveniently placed toilet roll holders, its tub that wouldn't drain, leaving you standing in two inches of water as you shower, its small and thin towels, acceptable for that charming B&B near Campo dei Fiore, but unacceptable for a multi-national chain hotel in nowhere suburban Rome and worst of all, the slow internet (10's of kilobytes per second). As noted by others, the free airport shuttle has a limited schedule. As of this date, it departs the hotel for the airport seven times per day, at 0700, 0830, 1000, 1330 1515, 1645 and 1815.

It did seem to be clean, but as some of the rooms are smoking, I could still smell the smell of cigarettes in my non-smoking room. There was one bottle of water in the minibar, nothing else.

It truly cries for rennovation. At least the conferrence area was now rennovated, so we can keep our fingers crossed, that they finally rennovate the rest of the hotel next year. No millions should be spared to bring this hotel up to snuff and correctly represent the proud name SHERATON. The windows are cheap 1960 slide style and do not insulate perfectly. The rooms are small and boxy like it was common in the 60ties. When they rennovate they have to enlarge the guestrooms. These smal rooms are not contemporary anymore. What is very strange for an american hotel is the fact that the rooms have NO coffeemakers or ironing boards, which are mandatory requirements these days. That, the umbrella and a descent soundsystem are necessary considerations for a rennovation. Also finally make internet FREEly available everywhere and do NOT charge for softdrinks. With these two easy complementary amenities a hotel in Milan could make it to NO. 1 on Trip Advisor. It is so easy to please your guests with little things. The pool is really great (even though unfortunately no spa with sauna). This is a great advantage of the hotel, but closed in October and November?, even though the current weather with over 25 degrees during the day would allow the use any time. How darn stupid is it to close it, though? You always have to adapt to the climate quickly. The staff is generally kind and helpful. English is spoken throughout the entire hotel.

I needn't have worried however as the hotel was more than satisfactory. The staff were more than helpful and my room was excellently furnished and clean. Also I opted to take a taxi from the airport which was 35 euros but the hotel does run a shuttle service for around e8. The food (which is excellent) and drink is a little expensive (draught beer 7.80 euros, bottled beer 6.40 euros and most dishes on the menu are around the 15 euros mark) but this is Rome after all. I also ate out during the day and you can find good prices if you look. I had a two course lunch with a beer at 15 euros. I have to say I wasn't aware of having to pay a city tax for each day I stayed until I received my final bill, so be wary of this if you haven't already been told. It's 3 euros per day. I don't know if that's per person or per room. The internet was free for the first hour every day. More than enough for me at any rate. Hey, I'm on holiday after all. I don't want to be on the internet all day. The shuttle bus from the hotel to the city centre costs e3 per day including return and runs from 8.00 am until 11.30 pm running every hour or so. You'll find a time table at reception. It drops you off at a central location and then you just find your way around using one of the excellent maps you will get from reception before you leave. Don't be mis-lead by the map it really isn't that far to walk to most of the historical sites. I walked from our drop off point to the Vatican in about half an hour at a sprightly pace I might add. Similarly from the drop off point, the Trevi Fountain and the Colloseum are easily within walking distance. You can if you wish take a guided tour bus. This will take you to the various sites where you can get off the bus have a look round and then get on another bus and go to the next site and do the same. If you go to the Colloseum you might want to go pretty early if you want to go inside. I got there early afternoon and the queue to get in was about 300 yards long so I gave it a miss. Still a beautiful site though. A trip to the Vatican is well worth it. I arrived there only to be accosted by a guy asking if I spoke English and would I like to go on a guided tour. I was a bit apprehensive. You never know if you're being conned. I needn't have worried there were a few others like myself and at the end of the day I have to say it was well worth it. It cost 25 euros and our guide was a German guy called Karl who has been doing the tours for 61/2 years. (If you can find him he's your man). He was very knowledgeable about the whole of Rome and in particular the Vatican. We walked around the streets of the city stopping on the way for refreshments etc and then moved on to the Vatican Museum including the Sistine Chapel and the Basilica and take my word for it they're all breathtakingly beautiful and well worth seeing.

If you are a traveler/tourist and are going to pay out of your own pocket, or if your company does not cover this hotel, don't stay here. This hotel would be a great option if your flight out of Rome was in the morning. They have an airport shuttle for only 5 euros a person - which is a GREAT deal. This hotel is in the EUR district, which is very far and inconvenient from the center. Don't even bother walking to the metro to get to the city - just pay the 3 euros for the shuttle bus, which takes you to the Colloseum area/plaza at the south end of Via del Corso. So if you're coming to Rome to HAVE FUN, tour around, and enjoy the city, DO NOT STAY HERE. But if you're coming to Rome for business, or like I said, staying here the night before your flight out of Rome, this is a great hotel. You should save your credit card points for another hotel, but if you MUST use it up because they're going to expire, might as well use them up here. With that said, here's my actual review about the hotel, not taking into account it's crap location and all. We loved how this was an \"American\" or \"Sheraton\" hotel, so the bathrooms, the entire room looked like an actual American hotel room...from the 1970's. It's obviously in dire need of remodeling - but compared to the other hotels in Rome (a VERY OLD city), it's pretty good. The staff of the hotel definitely aren't nice, but I don't blame them since they have to deal with tourists like us ALL the time who don't understand the language or ways of the area. The pool and lounge area is very clean - and the food isn't THAT expensive..taking into account that you are eating in a hotel. We really enjoyed our dinner in this hotel. The pasta was decent (hard to mess up in Italy), but I really enjoyed my dish with fish and vegetables (around 20 euros). Again, since this hotel isn't in the city, there's no laundrette here. Since Rome was our last stop in Italy before going back home to the States, we were exhausted and spent our last days in the room laying around watching TV. We ordered room service pizza which was EXTREMELY good - better than most of the pizzas we ate outside. If we were to come back to Rome to tour and enjoy the city, obviously we wouldn't stay here. But we definitely would stay here again (using our points of course - I don't know how much people actually pay to stay here) if we needed to (night before our flight) because this is a very comfortable hotel, it's clean, there's computers you can use, and the shuttle to the airport is ridiculously cheap.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel, more American than Italian.\u201d", "Author": "slmarotta", "ReviewID": "UR118016887", "Content": "The hotel was very nice with great ammenities.

Another SPG disappointment...Che peccato!!\u201d", "Author": "Webpuccino", "ReviewID": "UR117674469", "Content": "I am so disappointed as how much standards have dropped at this starwood property. It pains me to write a bad review but feel that travelers need to hear the straight skinny especially from a seasoned traveler. I never experienced service problems at this property until now. I found that the maid never came several days in a row and we were not part of a green plan which the hotel does offer. I had to call room service for clean towels twice in a row or two days in a row. Unclear why a Starwood Platinum guest was treated so poorly unless platinum guests are truly not appreciated at Starwood properties. Starwood does franchise their licenses but it seems strange that the licensees do not treat frequent travelers well except that they truly do not care. I will first describe the restaurant. I love the restaurant and have always found Enrico and his staff attentive and the food very good. I typically tend to eat the antipasto since I am fat and enjoy salads...or it is all that my wife permits me to eat. Those married, know the value of keeping their spouses happy....When she is not looking, I tend to sneak in a few gelati during the day so we are even. Tonight, I visited the club lounge and will tell you more about it later. What I want to tell you is that I ran into many folks whom did eat the buffet that were disappointed. They paid 35E and said the choices were small. The majority of the buffet was for antipasto which is what I have tried and that the remainder was limited to two first course (pasta) choices, two main dishes and 2-3 vegetables as well as two soups. Some felt it was not worth the 35 Euro/person. You could order a portion of the buffet but will be limited to only one or two choices if you choose the first or second choice menu items. Both American and German guests said that the buffet was terrible. I have yet tried it this trip so cannot comment. Now on to the club. The usual folks are still on their August vacation and I hope they arrive soon. I need Paola, Alessandra, and Saeed to quickly return. I have fopiund the help currently filling in at the club lounge to be vastly insuperior and lacking the various basic hospitality skills. Tonight, I was yelled at for steaming a cappuccino. The capuccino arrived cold (temp) without the usual steamed milk (foam) (\"La Sciuma in Italian) or the color of \"la crema\" from the espresso that will yield the Cappuchin brown color that the beverage was named after. The attendant explained to me that the Francis/Francis illy coffee maker was only used for espresso and quickly inItalian, I asked why there were cappuccino cups on the machine if they did not want folks to make cappuccino. I also explained that cappuccino is expected to be served hot and when it arrived lukewarm, I attempted to do the basic. The real question is why did the attendant serve such an insuperior beverage in Italy. Clearly, she would not have served it at home nor drink it herself. What I found to be odd was that I had to reject two cups of cappuccino before I saw one with foam. What surprised me to begin with is earlier in the day, I asked for a cafe macchiato (espresso coffee stained with milk ) and a latte macchiato (steamed milk stained with espresso) and received neither but two cappuccinos. I guess the Italian staff at this hotel thought that italo-americanos (Americans of Italian descent) would not know the difference. What they don't know is that we are fluent in not the official language but the dialect and tend to understand the official language not to mention parolacci (bad words). We did know the difference from a latte macchiato served typically in a glass throughout Italia and an espresso macchiato served in an espresso cup. The club lounge is the same as it has been in the past ten years. You will find two computers with one shared printer and will need to make sure the printer is mounted to your workstation in order to print. They do not charge you to print out things by the page. Throughout the day, they have Pejo sparkling and natural mineral water, coca cola, coca-cola light, sprite, prosecco (Italian sparkling wine JEIO brand...same one you find at most Starwood Italai properties), red wine (Chianti) and a white wine. They also have large bowls of potato chips, corn chips and hard toast as well as a tray of normal cookies (nothing special and not amaretti) during the day. At night, the cookies are replaced with small cubes of average marguerita pizza. I say average since the crust is not \"crocante\" or crisp like the italians like and the cheese is sparse on the pizza. In the morning, they have continental breakfast with really hard cresent rolls (cornetti) and are among the worst I have sampled or tried in all of Italy during the past 40 years. This was mybiggest disappointment since the large amount of butter in the cornetti usually leave them flaky and good. I tend to gravitate to the cornetti but not this time. In fact, when I see them, I run in the opposite direction as fast as I can and head for a real Italian bar to have a cappuccino and cornetti. If this were my first experience, I would not have ever tried them. Since I like walking at night or early in the morning to take sunrise photos, I have found a baker off of Via Tiburtina that makes them and sells them before he loads them in his truck and they are to die for good. It is a shame that a large hotel would not have a pastry chef. For those seeking out sweets, I recommend you try sfogliatelle (clamshell like pastry made with lots of butter and filled with ricotta and candied fruit) over cannolis. The cannoli shells here are fried in vegetable oil and not in lard like they used to be. Carlo's Bakery in Hoboken NJ still fries their cannoli shells in lard and this is why they are the best. Too many health conscience folks want zero trans fats....If youa re eating a cannoli, are you really worried about the fat content? ...Really? I had to call room service twice in two days to get maid service or towels. You would think that maid service was on strike (sciopero) as does alot of things in Italy. It is amazing at how hard it is to get clean towels not to mention a bar of soap. The hotel does not have wash cloths so if you are inclined to using the bidet, you may need to crab and clean the family jewels Arab style using the left hand. I do not know how you use the bidet without a cloth to clean your backside and family jewels except with your hand. If youa re left handed, I guess you can use your right hand. :) The rooms are very very small. They are very small. I did get to see what an executive suite looks like. I met another couple that also complained that their bedroom was small. It was the same size. They had a large dining/living room that was approx double the size of the bedroom which meant that the executive suite was equivalent in size to three rooms, You may want to ask yourself if it is really worth you staying here in a suite given the small size of the bedroom. The bedroom will be the same size as a normal room. Service in general.....not good throughout the hotel. It seems that the staff would prefer to not engage a guest nor do they recognize that if it were not for guests that they would have an empty hotel. I wanted to see the 10M restoration to the conference center but it was still under construction. Platinum amenities are a minibar credit, bottle of wine or a T-shirt....Some club members get a small bottle of orange liquer. I did not get one so it must not be for platinum guests. It must be for special guests of the hotel for which the hotel wants to acknowledge their patronage. Not clear who gets it but I had a hard enough time trying to get my room cleaned or the trash taken out. I did not sign up for the green program but still found it difficult to seek the basics. If you plan to take a taxi from the hotel, I recommend you telephone one by calling 168 on your cell phone. The taxi drivers the hotel uses tend to overcharge guests and are very expensive. The prices are posted in the cab but yet when you sit down, you can expect the driver to charge you more than 3 times that amount to start the meter. Taxis when ordered either from the St. Regis Grand or the Westin Excelsior do not have this problem. I ran into many guests that felt they were ripped off by the taxi driver and I agree that they were as so was I. The taxi that the Bell Captain telephoned for me must have been his \"brother-in-law\" or partner in crime since once we sat down, we were charged 7E. The price should have been 2.5E so unclear why we were charged 7E. Others experienced a wide difference but not that high. Some were charged between 3-5E. It is unclear why this hotel does not try to control this since i do not recommend anyone use the hotel bell captain to call a taxi. I recommend you radio a taxi directly. You may back a little more for the taxi to arrive since he will typically start the meter once he gets a call but it is not like 7E. The 7E was not the radio charge since the taxi arrived within 30 seconds of being called. Unclear why so many experience difficulties in taxis from the hotel. The other thing is the metro. If you walk to the metro, you will take a walk that is not pretty. I do not recommend it. The walk is along a road littered with trash and I mean alot of trash. There are glass bottles, paper, used condoms, etc along the side of the road not to mention overgrown plants crowding the narrow walk way. I have never seen so much trash lying along side of the road and if I did not know where I was, I would have thought that I was in Naples during the trash strike. Also, the cars tend to take the curves pretty fast so do not walk in the streets. I have given this property another try and once again disappointed. I never would have thought that the property would have declined from last year but it is several magnitudes worse. I highly recommend Starwood management send a mystery shopper to inspect this hotel. I found it to be a serious lapse in basic standards and would hardly classify it as a one star property. It used to be very good with innovative programs and conveniences and now is just blah. Also, there are no free English channels offering programs or movies like Sky movies or sky sport. They want you to buy the pay-per-view package at a high rate. The Airport shuttle is 5E/per each way and the city shuttle is 3E from the hotel only. To catch the airport shuttle, you exit the arrival area and immediately proceed all the way down tot he right to the end of the terminal (T3) and then go outside and continue down on the right under the freeway where buses are parked and look for the Sheraton sign at bus stall # 14. Their schedule is posted there. If you are int he city center, the stop is near the mouth of truth (famous from Roman Holiday when Cary Grant scared Audrey Hepburn that he had his hand eatened by the mouth.) The street is Via Luigi Petroselli No 52/54. It is also close to the Tempio di Vesta and down from Teatro Marcello. The bus runs approx every 90 minutes. If you want to stay here, please keep in mind that you are closer to their freeway and not the ancient city center. It pains me to see a property go downhill so much. I used to enjoy staying here and lately, i seem to be disappointed more and more. This is the first SPG property in Italy that I have stayed at that did not yield an excellent review. The Excelsior and the St. Regis are excellent properties as is the Eden Hotel. I found them exceptional and I recommend you look at the Golf de Medici or the 4 Points. The 4Points Roma West has an indoor pool and is excellent as well. The Sheraton Rome reminds me of a very very old person on life support.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Elciego, Spain", "Title": "\u201cStill terrible.

There is a Sheraton Golf hotel not far away and they have ample free parking. Service in this hotel is worse and is much more worse this year than last year. Last year, I voted this property poor, this year it receives the score of terrible since I found very little good to write about. To start, the reception is under a renovation as are the meeting rooms. As a meeting planner, I decided to evaluate the property to see if it is a candidate and once again, it falls below standard for other properties in the area. There is a shuttle that will take you into town for 3E and the metro is a ten minute walk. If you do walk, be careful since the road is littered with broken glass bottles, trash, no sidewalk for a portion of the walk and no signs so you may make a wrong turn if you are unfamiliar with the area. I have walked it several times but do not recommend it unless you know what to expect since Italians tend to take curves in their cars very closely. I also recommend that you bring towels. We found that the maid did not come one day until close to 16:00 and we had to call for maid service several times earlier in the day and noone picked up the guest services line when called. As a frequent traveler (platinum in Starwood, Gold in Marriott and double diamond in Hilton) I rarely find a property that has good appearance and poor service. Reception checkin was not speedy. Alofts now have a keyless checkin where you can checkin using an Aloft card similar to a Starwood card. This property tended to be slow and queues long for checkin/out. If you are in a hurry, I recommend giving yourself more time. This hotel has a club lounge which has 2 personal computers with printers and a variety of drinks including wine (red and white) for consumption and offers continental breakfast in the mornings. The lounge is a nice size unlike the rooms which are quite small and if you are an Elite member, you can almost guarantee yourself no upgrade to a suite. I have never been upgraded during the five previous stays. In fact, the hotel did not have any record of me staying here in previous years which is quite odd since I know the Starwood systems record the total number of stays that one stays at. The rooms have automatic beverage bars are are not nice about it if you were to accidentally remove an item. They tell you if you remove an item, that you will be charged and they will not remove the charge from the bill when you check in. They have made this quite clear especially since I only removed an item to read the label. Please do not make this mistake. The small can cost nearly 10Euro. The area is in the EUR district which was created by Mussolini and the rooms are probably small keeping with his fascist style. I returned to this property only after colleagues recommended I try it since it has been renovated and once again, I see that not much has changed for the better but a great deal for the worst. I do not understand Starwood. I would have thought that they had re-engineered their image in spending Billions in renovating properties but it appears that service is declining and becoming worse and worse. I am surprised at how little is being placed on customer service and when confronting an employee with a simple \"Buon Giornio\", you will most likely be given a returned stare vice a similar greeting. When I state this on the street or in the stores, it is promptly repeated back so why not in the hotel? The property has great potential but clearly the management is poor or otherwise why is it that the Guest Service Center telephone is not manned.

That said, if you are here to see central Rome than the location is a bit of an issue. The hotel does provide a bus for a nominal fee but this ties you into a schedule which may or may not work for you. The alternative is to use the Metro which is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel-you will need to research the walking route as it isn't obvious once you leave the lobby. Though we never encountered any problems on our walks to the Metro-which we used every day for our 3 night stay. it should be noted that you will have to pass by a few deserted areas and likely will feel mildly uncomfortable especially if walking at night or alone. The upside to the hotel is the airport shuttle bus which again is for a nominal fee but is well worth it in comparison to toting your luggage to and through Termini.

There was a loud dance/music complex next to the hotel that plays music until 3 AM. It was so loud that we couldn\u2019t sleep without earplugs until the music stopped. 3.

Although the hotels website and email clearly said that Internet access in our room was included in the club lounge upgrade, they still added a charge for internet access at checkout and we had to argue until a manager finally removed the charge. 5. The ATM never had any cash in it. 6. Although the staff kept saying that we could buy Roma Passes at the front desk, they never showed up. One time I went down to the front desk at 6:45 AM, they said they said the passes would be there at 7:30 AM. Even though I sat in front of the desk for 45 minutes, when I asked about them at 7:30 AM, they said they were all gone. 7. We tried to eat dinner at the restaurant one night but the waiter only brought two out of four meals. After that, he kept bringing random meals and asked us if that was what we ordered.

I would suggest you request a room in the back of the hotel upon check-in so it won't be a problem. Once we were moved, the noise was no longer a problem.

Taxis were always available. We used the shuttle from the airport, we had to wait a while since the timing wasn't the best, but it was fine and resonably priced.

The shower was in the bath - used a curtain. 1 hour Internet for free (per day) was available in the lobby on their PCs - this was very slow.

Wine prices were not outrageous either and coffees were very reasonably priced. Breakfast was very good and included with a good range - even bread for toast!

The quality is good - great beds, good loos, good airconditioning, great free breakfast and a decent price room service ( 12 euros for a pasta). Surely, the place needs revamp but would that not take up the rates by a lot? The airport shuttle was bang on time giving us a ride to hotel for 5 euros each.

The hotel is a bit shabby on the outside but the interior is fine with some minor renovations off the main lobby going on. The rooms are clean and up to the usual Sheraton standard. Overall, not too bad. Check-in: The front desk is terribly designed. You have to wind your way through unorganized throngs to get to the elevator when you come and go. It sticks right out in the way of traffic. The Concierge is among the check-in staff and I was told by him to go to them to check in. While there I heard the same thing a half a dozen times. This could be remedied in the short term by a simple sign that says \"Concierge\" but apparently the management never thinks like this. The check in staff were incredibly helpful and friendly however (as was the Concierge). There aren't enough of them and they work way too hard because some suit couldn't be bothered to analyze the design of the check in area. It's embarrasing. Luggage Storage: I checked a bag since I arrived in the early morning. Instead of a secure room there is just a corner of the lobby divided by a velvet rope. When I went to get my bag there was no one around so I just took it. Not secure and actually quite irresponsible of the hotel management. Shuttle: It runs reliably and will bring you downtown for 3 Euro. Not a bad service. Takes about 1/2 hour each way. Be aware that you will be outside town if you choose this hotel. There is also a dependable airport shuttle for a few Euro. It worked for us. Breakfast: OK buffet but there were no fewer than 10 waiters standing around doing next to nothing. Their only apparent function was clearing plates and pouring coffee and they ignored me 3 mornings in a row while congregating around my table. I did notice that attractive women were given coffee. This didn't help me much. Noise: I was given a room next too a cleaning crew utility room and there was a heck of a lot of noise coming from there all day and most of the night. I slept OK due to jet lag but the hotel should never have sold that room. Check-Out: After observing the constant chaotic crowds at the desk at all hours my colleagues and I asked if we could check out the night before. The staff willingly accomodated our request. Nice people. Otherwise we probably would have missed the airport shuttle. Good staff (other than those idiotic waiters) but an really thoughtless general management and perhaps corporate management.

Our last visit to a Sheraton was the Sheraton Voyager, Antalya which was excellent by comparison, and so we thought we would try another Sheraton branded hotel. The grounds are basic, the hotel is undergoing buildings work probably until the end of the year - which causes a lot of dust in and around the lobby area - avoid if you have allergies! The service was very average - there was a 2 hour wait when we arrived due to lack of unavailable rooms - this I believe was an oversight of Expedia! Check-in took a long time and the staff seemed very casual. We had a Starwood Preferred Guest Room, which is meant to be a far superior room than the standard. The room itself was very dusty - there was just a smell stale dust in the air, which caused my wife to react quite badly, due to her dust allergy. Regardless we stayed the first night in the room, only to our peril! We asked to move rooms the next day and the hotel moved us a few doors down, this room was slightly less dusty and had obviously been sprayed with air freshener. Despite the room being a little cleaner my wife got much worse to the point where she had a fever and so we had to cancel the rest of the trip and come back home early - which was an obvious disappointment. Check-out took an age - approx 25min! The hotel refused to refund us but offered us other rooms - by which time we were sick of the cleanliness. We've taken some photos of dust actually clinging onto the walls of the room! To add to this, there was an open-air disco across the road from the hotel, the bass from which vibrated the windows! The music went on until approx 2-3am up until we left. The hotel didn't do much about it other than call the police, who didn't do much either. The grounds are pretty average, and the hotel is approx 15min walk from the closest metro station, this is a nice(ish) walk in the day time but is a little dodgy after dark. It is in the middle of what seemed a pretty run down area. The food once again is nothing compared to the Sheraton Voyager - and incredibly over priced. The service in the restaurant was far better. Only when we stated that we were cutting the holiday short did anyone show some sympathy and offered a room without carpets as some help - however by this time we were sick of the hotel and had already changed our flights. The hotel also decided to charge the credit card additional nights worth of stays for Rome City tax - this will be disputed as we weren't even in the Country during this! I guess it adds to their (lack of) professionalism. In short - do not stay at this hotel if you want luxury or a decent service; its probably fine as a quick stopover for business but not for couples or family.

I am up at 2 AM on our 1st night here writing this review which should tell you something. Lets start with the good. The good: Decently clean room. Standard 3 star business hotel (like a hampton inn). Upgraded us to Superior room (made us wonder how bad standard rooms would have been) due to telling them its our honeymoon. Surprised us with a complimentary bottle of champagne plus bottles of water! Pretty good staff although appeared overworked. Bus to city center (next to Capitol Hill) was convenient. Could use a few more stops in Rome. Next, the bad: OLD and DATED room. Needs renovation in a bad way! One light bulb was out. Called to the front desk asking to replace plus bringing some more towels. Towels came, but no one ever showed to fix the light. Overcrowded lobby/check in area due to constant arrival of large tour bus and tour groups. \"Gated\" paid parking feel just as vulnerable to break-ins as the free parking on the other side of the \"gate\", which is just a arm that lowers at the entrance. Anyone could walk in and break into your car. Thin walls where conversations in the hallway was a disturbance. Location is as bad as it gets with it being FAR FAR away from the city center or anything else for that matters. Feels like it is trapped by highways on all sides, and sounds like it too in the room. You won't be able to walk anywhere, even the metro station, so thank goodness for the bus service they offer. Lobby area is undergoing renovation so you have the constant chaos of 5 tour buses trying to back out of the check in drive way, which fits 2 small cars at most. Not attractive at all. Now, lets talk about the worst part, and the reason I'm up at 2 AM. A \"new\" disco opened up across the street, as the staff informed me. Tonight being the first time this has happened. Loud, obnoxious club music blasting the entire hotel. I mean loud to the point I can hear what the idiotic DJ is shouting to the crowds. I was woken up by this at 1AM and called down to the lobby. The staff told me it is a new disco down the street. When I ask what time will the music stop, he said its the first time this has happened so he doesn't know. Well, it appears Rome clubs usually go on until sunrise. Thats another 3 hours that we will have to endure this!!!! This is something completely unacceptable and is absolutely ruining our trip. This is also a hotel we will not be booking again ever. Despite the staffs' attempts to keep it a 4 star level hotel and the special treatment we received, there are just too many bad things going against it for us to consider this place again. Concluding analysis: Not a 4 star hotel in terms of quality, even though the amenities are there. A solid but dated 3 star hotel IMO. Too far from city center and there are other nicer and newer \"boutique\" hotels that are on the outskirts as well. I would pay more next time just to stay closer to the city or look for a newer hotel thats more on the outskirt.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "dabearsfan007", "Title": "\u201cHorrible location, unfriendly staff, nice rooms\u201d", "Author": "dabearsfan007", "ReviewID": "UR109239328", "Content": "pros - spacious rooms and bathroom, clean cons - not a friendly staff at all (during check-in or asking for assistance).

Otherwise, I would recommend this hotel - as long as you are prepared to walk about 15 minutes to the nearest train station (note: the shuttle is very infrequent - only every 90 minutes).", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Espoo, Finland", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel for the price\u201d", "Author": "samiva", "ReviewID": "UR105582923", "Content": "We stayed at the Sheraton Roma over the Easter and did find it pretty much the way we expected. Couple of surprises were there and maybe if we had read the other reviews we would have known also about those facts. Location is quite far from the centre but I suppose anyone should be able to tell that from the map before making reservations. Therefore I dont understand why people complain about the location.. What you most probably wont see from the map is the fact that the two metro stations (Marconi and EUR Magliana) are not very easily reachable by foot even though they appear close on the map. The hotel is next to a busy freeway and you either have to cross some busy lanes or walk on the side of the road to get to the metro station. Once you get the hang of it, I guess it is pretty ok. But be careful, Italians drive like crazy and don't care about pedestrians.. The hotel itself is in pretty good condition from inside, but you can see that it has already seen the best of her days. There is refurbishing going on so it might be that the hotel looks very different after a year or two. The elevators are brand new and we also liked the gym downstairs which had new equipment. The bad thing was the water machine in the gym was always empty in the morning and rarely they had clean towels. There is wifi in the lobby are but in the rooms it's only the old fashioned cable connection. Therefore an iPad was worthless in the room and wifi was stunning 7\u20ac for the first 1/2h. They had a deal for 16\u20ac for the full day but I didn't see it very useful since the signal didn't reach the rooms. There are four computers downstairs which were always very crowded, so take your time if you want to use the internet. The breakfast was ok, but for Sheraton I would have expected that the staff would even know what an omelette is. But yes, there is scrambled eggs and bacon, sausages and all the basic stuff. Since the hotel is pretty far away from the centre and there are no restaurants nearby, we mostly ate dinner at the hotel. The selection and the food is good, go ahead and try it. The atmosphere isnt very romantic and paying 100\u20ac for two person's buffet and drinks is quite much to be honest. But as a tip I would suggest the following: it is possible to get just part of the buffet, for instance only the salads from the table. Or you can only have the meat or the pasta part of the buffet to get you around 10-15\u20ac for the dinner. There is a car park outside of the hotel, so I would especially recommend the hotel if you're driving through Rome and need a place to stay in. All-in-all, semi-ok experience.

The hotel shuttle costs 3 euros per person and goes to Piazza Venezia. The trip took about 20 minutes, which was OK. These are the things I'm not happy about: 1. The hotel interior: furnishings very old, decorated in a 1960's Las Vegas low price casino fashion. There is renovation going on, so walking from the lobby to the elevator, you walk through a \"construction zone\". TV in the room is not a flat screen. The model is at least 15 years old. 2. Front reception: very busy. My room key cards did not work so I had to go back and stand in line again. There were 4 people in front of me. It took about 10-15 minutes to take care of 1 person, as each time there were some kind of problems to sort out. The staff don't smile and appear unfriendly. 3. Service poor and they charge high prices for everything. The hotel is stuck in the middle of nowhere off a freeway ramp. No coffeemaker in the room. I asked for some hot water, and they told me they charge 8 euros. The lady sounded embarrassed after she said 8 euros and apologized, she said I'm sorry but that's the hotel policy. I almost wanted to laugh. What was that??!! I would not rate this a 4-star hotel. The hotel obviously made a decision to cater to very large tourist groups, and the value and services are very poor for individual travellers. The interior was last updated at least 15-20 years ago, and the hotel is of the poorest quality comparing to other hotels we stayed at in Italy.

The staff in the club lounge were very friendly and helpful, especially Said and Mara. We had turn down service in our room, my daughter especially loved the chocolates. One night we came home to find fresh fruit, another a bottle of Chianti. The shuttle from the airport for 5 euros per person is a great deal. The shuttle into the city for 3 euros also a great deal - although it could have run more often. There are 3 city buses that pick up right in front of the hotel - when the timing of the shuttle didn't work well. All and all, the location was not great but the options for getting into the city work well. Cons - It's on a freeway ramp. We were there in the in between season, heat off, AC not on so the rooms were warm and when we opened windows - noise from the freeway. The staff at the front desk - not so helpful. We found they gave us incorrect information or just did not know the answers to many things. Getting into the city was pretty easy but plan for more time than you think you'll need - it takes a while to get everywhere. Traffic is horrendous so factor that in. Free Internet if on a club floor - very handy. Overall, a good choice for seeing Rome if you are on a budget and are not daunted by the thought of trying out the public transit systems.

I got a phenominal deal for this hotel on Travel Zoo (I think it was something like $90 CAD/night and it included so many extras) Some of the extras were free shuttle service into town, free breakfast, free internet, 10% off of hotel food and I think free shuttle service to the airport. The main downfall of this place was it's location. It was not close at all to \"downtown\" Rome i.e the Colloseum, the Spanish Steps etc. BUT they had a shuttle service that took care of getting you to and from the main part of town. Once you got to the one drop off point, you had to find your way to the tourist attractions. My mom and I got one of those hop-on/hop-off bus packages (I do not recommend the green one that we took as their weekend scheduled altered dramatically). The downfall of this shuttle service was that it had scheduled times that it would pick up and drop off at- the night time you were lucky if you could get a spot on the bus and if you didn't, you would have to wait an hour plus to catch the next one. A suggestion would be to offer more times to take the shuttle, especially later in the evening. No tourist wants to hang around on a street corner at night in Rome waiting for a bus and the cabs are not cheap! The room itself was probably the smallest we encountered in Italy but it was still very nice as was the bathroom. I think the highlight of this place was it's pool and the poolside bar. It was beautiful and a fun place to hang out at night. Not too sure what to say about the food- food is very important to my mother and I and because this place literally does not have any restaurants or bars by it in the area, you relay entirely on their restaurants which are pricy and not that good. I remember some guy next to us getting a barely cooked hamburger, I got a club sandwich and it showed up with eggs and uncooked bacon on it and breakfast was just alright in the morning. I felt like it was trying to hard to cater to the \"North American\" crowd as the majority of the guests were business men. I would have preferred them sticking to traditional Italian meals and specialties. When in Rome right? All-in all my reviews are mixed- if you don't get an amazing deal, I would suggest picking something closer to the main hussle and bussle.

Early arrivers easily picked up the hotel shuttle from the FCO Rome airport for I believe 5Euro and thus got to the hotel easily on their own. One group member sat at the pool all day and relaxed. Each member was able to use points to stay here, so the focus was saving money vs. being \"right\" in Rome. (the sheraton in rome is many, many more points, understandably) We were also able to call in advance and get adjoining rooms on the same floor. The first day we had a little confusion about the hotel shuttle (its a large bus, actually) to Rome (schedule at the conceirge desk) we knew we had to pay 3 EURO, but didn't realize at first that we had to pay the concierge, get a paper receipt, and give that paper receipt to the driver. Check the schedule when you get there,: TO TOWN: 8.30 9:00 9.30 10.00 11.00 12.30 14.00 15.30 17.00 18.30 20.00 21.30 23.00.

This did not happen to us, but other guests warned us if you wait for the last bus back to the hotel at night, you can risk the bus filling up, and then you have to take a taxi back on your own. Their advice was take the 10 or 10:30 back to the hotel to factor in a full bus. (again, this did not happen to us) BE PROMPT the bus does not wait around, it is in and out quickly. TIP: Address for Pickup/Drop off Shuttle to/from Rome is: Via del Teatro Marchello (use google maps street view) to look at this area, to become familiar. Especially after a glass of wine/in the dark.Landmark close by is the (huge) Victor Emmanuel monument\u2026you walk up from the drop off point, kinda on the right side of it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_to_Vittorio_Emanuele_II Our group started our day with the \"Rome from the Sky\" elevator to its rooftop to enjoy a grand 360-degree view\u2026.and get a lay of the land. We did not have to wait to go up in the elevator, but did have to wait to go down. Some of our travel group (embarrasingly) overpacked, and the hotel conceirge was kind enough to keep bags in the bag room for them (gave them claim tickets) while we travelled on to other parts of italy, and eventually came back to this Sheraton location. - Safes in room were easy to use. - One group member that arrived a day early, said the continental breakfast and regular breakfast were 20 - 30 euros (not included in our package) Needless to say they went into town to eat. - A group member reported that internet in your room had a charge, but if travelling with your computer, in the lobby it would be free wireless. - A group of 5 took a taxi with lots of luggage to the Termini main train station. it was 40 euros for all the people and baggage charges - Another day, 2 people took a taxi from Rome Termini taxi sign area to this hotel, We bargained for 25 euros vs. other unmarked young taxi drivers were trying to say 50e. The younger men were aggressive and would take hold of your rolling luggage, and start rolling toward their car, we just yanked it away, and found an older calmer taxi driver. The subway was only 1 euro per person, but since one person had a ton of luggage, so we did not think a 10 minute walk to the actual hotel off the metro was wise, just to try to save $. I was glad we took the taxi, especially b/c who knew if the subway station had stairs only (likely so).

Last night, we came back from downtonw on the 10 pm bus, and half of the people were not allowed on. There was no lineup procedure, and it was a free for all as everone pushed their way on.

I chose this hotel because we would get club benefits (free food and drinks throughout the day). As a \"replacement\" the hotel gives one drink coupon per day.

The front desk were fine about it, surprisingly, but it's not nice to have to drag yourself out of bed at that time and pack all your things. The second room, facing the other side was fine - but about a quarter of all rooms would be affected. Do you feel lucky? The concierge staff were on the whole quite abrupt and a little rude when we spoke to them on several occasions. It's not a job I'd enjoy and clearly they don't either, but since they did at some point fill out an application form for it, they could at least smile or be courteous - I'd like to think it's not a typical Italian characteristic. Food was so-so. Pool is a bit dated and the few sunbeds are taken quite early in the mornings - best of luck! Overall the hotel is dated and maintained to just about a reasonable standard - they're not investing too much into it anyway. Shower was great but all the fittings were old, falling apart and grubby. Didn't feel very clean. We were in a Club Room, which you'd expect a little more from. There's a Club Lounge with free internet if you can get on one of the two terminals. Free soft drinks and wine, but nothing to write home about and when they do bring any hot food to it, it's feeding time at the zoo. Another gripe was being sent by staff at the completely empty front desk, bup to the Club Floor to check-in. When I got there, there was a big queue. Stupid system. Overall it was okay - only major complaint was the noise. They let us have a 4pm check-out for which I'm giving them big credit. And they let us move from the noisy room. But next time I'd stay closer to Rome - the local metro station is a horrible walk away.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thessaloniki, Greece", "Title": "\u201cA typical conference hotel\u201d", "Author": "Tipoukoitos", "ReviewID": "UR69670918", "Content": "Booked there for 2 nights for a conference.

This isn't made clear on the web site or until you get to the hotel and pick up a timetable. If you do get stuck - buy train tickets from Tabac kiosk in the airport - saves queuing in station - you need a train ticket for the 'Leonardo Express' (\u20ac14) to Roma Termini (there are no stops inbetween it will take you straight there) and one Metro ticket (\u20ac1) for Line B - EUR Magliana. From Metro station it is a 10 minute walk to hotel (if you have heavy luggage get a taxi - check directions on map before you arrive or use your iphone). You are right in the heart of Mussolini's EUR creation - admire or disapprove!!!! The hotel is defintely more focused on business travellers, so staff are functional rather than fussy - also I think this is the Roman way! When checked in there were a couple of minor glitches to sort out and I was less than impressed by the phone ringing out both for the reception and room service. However, having laughed that off, we booked ourselves onto the Hotel's city bus service (\u20ac3.00 into town, no fee coming back). The bus service was very handy and was always on time. From the drop off point you can walk (5-7 mins) into Trastevere (recommended) which is very picturesque and has some great restaurants. Also Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palantino are walkable from drop off point. The Metro goes round the centre of Rome so take this when you want to go to Vatican City & Spanish Steps. Metro is very cheap - \u20ac1 for each journey, check Metro tickets types on machines in station and buy best option depending on your agenda. Overall I would say Sheraton Roma is a good base for a reasonable price (we just had a standard room) - it was not a noisy hotel and we slept well. Room was clean and beds were comfortable. It has a pleasant bar and lounge area. Cost of food in Hotel is shocking due to exchange rate and of course Rome is one of the most expensive cities in Europe.

I booked this hotel having researched the area and previous reviews and of course the price. I paid approx \u00a380GBP per night for a standard room including breakfast which is a very good price for the Rome vicinity. The breakfast was the usual European selection although not too sure about the broccoli and cauliflower for breakfast which looked as if it was pre heated left over food from the previous night buffet. The other cooked food looked like food poisoning on a plate so opted for some toast, fruit and pastries. The hotel is about 6km out of the centre. There is a shuttle bus which is 3 euro per person (beats taxi price). This drops you off to the south of the city and picks you up at the same place. As the service is limited you might find getting back on a popular service a problem and having to get a taxi. The walk from the stop is approx 15 minutes to the Colosseum and further to other sights. The service at the hotel as is luke warm at best. Concierge is... putting it politely a bit sketchy, they don't really seem to care but if you do your own research this shouldn't be a problem for you. The reception staff are mostly overworked and don't actually care about you as a guest. Having spent a lot of time in Italy this is not uncommon in cheaper properties and just accept this as the way Italy sometimes is (for the price). If I was paying \u00a3150 - \u00a3200 per night I would be annoyed but I feel I got what I paid for. The rooms at the hotel are clean and a good size, the beds are extremely comfortable, especially after a long day walking around the city. Food and snacks are expensive but as out in Rome all day you shouldn't really need to use this service. There are many great restaurants in Rome that you will enjoy so much more. In conclusion, this hotel is a perfectly good hotel for the price. Don't stay there with high expectations of service or a luxury hotel. You pay the cheap price and you get what you pay for. This is good value if you plan your trip and don't mind a bit of inconvenience in terms of getting into Rome. If you want a great hotel in the centre of Rome expect to pay over double their rate and get the better service and more intimate hotel if not just visit Rome and sleep here.

Firstly would be lovely if they had a shuttle to/from ciampino as well as Da Vinci Airport as we arrived late in the city centre on the airport bus only to be absolutely fleeced by a local taxi as we had missed the last hotel shuttle. We knew we were being overcharged, but were grateful to get out of the city and to our hotel. However it was only once we arrived at the hotel we discovered that the fare should have been no more than 20 euros and we had been asked for more that three times that amount. I had got a good rate with hotwire but was very disapointed to discover just how far outside Rome their \"Central Rome\" hotel was and basically feel rather ripped off by that also - prior to that I was a big hotwire fan. We then, due to flight time changes had to book an extra night that we had to do with another firm (booking.com). I then emailed the hotel asking them to combine our two bookings so we could stay in the same room. They emailed back saying this was all in hand and as it was a special birthday celebration they were giving us a specially nice room. When we arrived no provision had been made for combining our bookings. We were told we had to book in and out again. This however we were told wiould be done by the staff seemlessly andwithout our being even aware of it. We were then shown to a small, shabby room with footprints on the wall and a half eaten pot of honey in the mini bar. Peeling paint and general grubbyness and damaged furniture were also an unwelcome feature. Hardly the special room that the email promised. At 8am I fould a sheet saying that we had been checked out in our absence while we were \"on our way to breakfast\". The bill also seemed to say that charges to the room had been charged to a different credit ard than the one we had asked additional charges to be billed to. The 24 hour movie/intenet package we purchased was shut off and a female housekeeping staff member barged in despite the do not disturb sign on the door further making us most uncomfortable. When I complained that the internet access I purchased was not working a member of staff suggested I phoned the service provider - not exactly the assistance I was hoping for! When I complained the booking manager offered us an identical room which he said had been renovated on the 5th floor by way of apology which we declined. I then met the general manager who was very helpful and generous and upgraded us to a junior suite with club privileges which was lovely and also gave us a lovely bottle of proseccio in our new very beautiful room. We still had endless problems with the inhouse movie system so were refunded but after that we did have a lovely stay. The pool was lovely. The food overpriced and average but the we did expect Rome to be pricey. Generally we thought that staying outside the city centre with the shuttle bus was actually a good idea as I am sure for the price you could not get such great facilities in the city centre and it was a lovely quiet setting. However no shops within walking distance did make me feel rather isolated and I think 3 euros per person to catch the shuttle into Rome (free on th way back) was an annoying charge that despite only realy costing 1.50 each way just grated. Apart from the general manager and the staff at the club lounge I did find the staff a little condiscending at times but it was a very nice hotel with a lot to offer. Naturally being upgraded to junior suite (really lovely!) and enjoying all the many perks of the club lounge did make our stay very special but the let down of the initial shabby room and the annoyance of all the fuss made of booking us out and in due to the two bookings would make us wary of returning. So all in all, if you consider the inconvience of being outside the city being worth it to saty in a cool, airy, roomy hotel with outside pool in a leafy suburb and you are willing to risk getting a shabby room albeit at a very good price then I hope you will have a very nice stay at the Roma Sheritan.

People in Rome go out to diner at ten or eleven o'clock, if you follow the bus schedule you must eat by eight, so you can run back to the bus, let me tell you, that it's not easy to do. Rome is very big and very busy with traffic congestion. The third reason, every time you want to take the bus you have to pay 3 euro's which is about 5 dollars green back, when you pay the money you go one way, and free return from the city on the same money. But you have to understand that if there five hundred people staying at the hotel and they all go to the city center, they all want to go back to the hotel. The hotel bus holds 53 people, do the math, when I was there people got in fist fights trying to get back on the bus, the reson they were so determined to get back on the bus and not take a taxi is because it cost around 50 euro to go back to the hotel thats about 75 green back. The hotel said to me from city center to hotel 20 euro, they lied. The hotel tells you what you want to hear. The workers are so rude, but I did feel bad for the cleaning crew, they work the hell out of them. They say they have internet, they do, 12 euro from your room, they do have computers, they have six for 500 hundred people.

The booking service on the outward journey is fine if you book early enough but the return is everyone pushing to make sure they get even if that means that the family with the young children don't! The shuttle service from the airport to the hotel is quite a sparse service and the cost is 5 euros one way each. If you miss one you may have to wait 90 mins for the next so I suggest you ask the hotel for the timetable. The room was ok, dated and dark but plenty of room for a sofabed and a cot. The cot for the baby took 7 hours to arrive to the room which was a long time to wait with a little one. I had to make a few phone calls before it arrived. On the second night the cot collasped with the baby inside and it was a very frightening experience. The hotel's adittude was unreal, they sent a handyman to tie it together with plastic clips. I never sleeped again as everytime the baby moved I was awake. I suggest that you take your own travel cot to this hotel. I did complain to the Duty Manager and she assured me she would have the problem dealt with but as we said at check out this cot is a real health and safety issue and needs addressing urgently. I am send a letter to the head office on this matter. The hotel has 3 areas for breakfast which offer different levels of choice and service. 1 room is pleasant with fresh food and choice with a range of coffee, tea etc. The second room is also pleasant with less choice and luke warm weak coffee flasks sit on the table. The third room is a shame to the Sheraton with little choice and large function tables were guests are forced to sit together. Really not acceptable.

The rooms are more than adequate and provide a good alternative to higher priced lower quality properties in Rome itself. Caution: in April the hotel air conditioning was not yet turned on (public areas were air conditioned). Housekeeping provided a fan and the windows open, but these were no match for the heat and humidity of Rome. Staff were helpful and polite. The complementary breakfast included with our room was very good- many varieties of fresh fruit, juices, cold meats, breads, yogurts and cheeses. There were several hot selections available, but describing them as horrible would be kind. Room service is available but like the hotel bar it is prohibitively expensive The hotels location is its main drawback for the tourist visitor to Rome. The hotel compensates for this with a bus to take visitor into Rome. (about 8 departures per day- 3 euro return). The city center bus stop is not particularly well located (not at a metro station) but is ok. The cost of your ticket to the city center is charged to your room while the return trip is free you have no guarantee of space on the bus. We were one of five guests turned away from one of the return trips. It was not a major problem most of the time, but April is a shoulder season. I cannot speculate on how problematic this service would be during peak tourist seasons. We walked to the metro on several occasions and it provided excellent city center access. As other reviewers suggest, the walk takes only 5-10 minutes but it is along an off ramp from a major road. Still it was reasonably safe (from traffic) and I would not hesitate to walk to the metro during daylight hours. Mostly the traffic was sparse and not nearly as threatening as crossing a busy street in downtown Rome. There are also free shuttles from the hotel to a local shopping center and a cab to the brand new EURO center was only 15 euros. We extended our stay by one night- after getting on the internet to get a price, I asked for a quote from the front desk. The hotel itself was about 50 euro higher than the rate I could book on a number of sites. The hotel clerk acknowledged this and simply pointed me back to the internet terminal so I could book it myself. I am impressed with the actual prices available from Trip Advisor, Hotels.com and Expedia.com ect. I had never used these online services in Europe and was a little hesitant but it worked like a charm. On the 8 night stay, I saved about $500 vs. the prices available at the hotel or the Sheraton Website itself. All and all, we had a good stay and an enjoyable trip.

There is one huge drawback to the hotel, though... The hotel is located on the outskirts from city center. The shuttle they provide is good, but you're on their timetable. When they say they are close to the Metro, it's true. However, you take your life in your hands getting there. The walk to the Metro stop is along a very busy road. The sidewalks are so overgrown with weeds that you literally have to walk IN THE STREET! and they DO NOT drive slowly in Italy! There is a street that you have to cross walking back to the hotel from the metro that has a stop sign. However, as we learned the hard way...no one stops! and the bushes are so huge and overgrown that you cannot see the cars that are coming around. So...if you're a daredevil, use the metro. If not, use the shuttle or the bus system (which is a whole nother entitiy itself!) They do have a car rental office at the hotel which worked out wonderfully for us.

Our stay at Sheraton was mixed. The hotel itself is nice, spacious and clean, the staff are nice and helpful. Unlike many other people I did not have any problem with the AC or any other utility, everything worked great. Transportation: Since this is probably the biggest drawback about this hotel I will elaborate on this. Hotel provides a shuttle service to the center of rome and picks up from there. That is nice of them but it does eat into your time. Basically, shuttle itself takes 30 mins and you need to be present at the stop at least 15 mins in advance and do it both the ways, you end up spending 1.5 hours for shuttle. When you are vacationing time is a premium. And the shuttle stop in the city is a 15-20 min walk from the Roman forum. The other option is to take the Metro, Metro station is 10 mins walk from the hotel, there is not a good paved walkway for pedestrians, it is a little challenging but if you missed your shuttle, Metro is very convenient, and there is a Metro station right opposite the Colosseum. For 15-20 euros you can also take cabs to the city center. We did a day trip to Florence, we took the Metro to Termini and from there Eurostart to Florence, it took 1 hour 30 mins to one way. Worth the effort if you would like to do it. Food: I would not recommend you to eat at hotel, not only is it overpriced but also not that great. You can find much better food in the city. There are no small shops around, so buy your water bottles in the city itself.

Assuming they were busy, my wife went downstairs only to find the two front desk clerks sitting down doing nothing, while the phone was ringing right next to them. They also programmed our keys for only one night and so we were temporarily locked out of our room the second night. They made us wait to get the key changed and were not all apologetic.

Also, beware that they often tell you breakfast is included when you check in. However, this is only for preferred Starwoods members. We went to eat and luckily asked before sitting down, because breakfast is 25 euros per person. They were very rude when we asked about the complimentary breakfast and again made us wait and were unhelpful. We ran into another couple who had this same problem.

It is modern and spotless, with wonderful air conditioning during a heat wave, a great swimming pool, terriific restaurants and generally pleasant staff. We liked the room...exactly the quality we have come to expect at Sheratons with those great beds and nice bathrooms. The food was a big hit, from the enormous and delicious breakfast buffet to the poolside restaurant. Service was great inside, spotty at the pool. (Is there any pool in Italy that has good service?) A tasty pinot grigio helped us get over that. The location of the Sheraton Roma is the only hesitation you should have about staying here. I would not recommend it for a one-night stay. You will want to be closer to the main attractions in that case. But, having said that, there are good options that make it less of a challenge. Contrary to one reviewer, the hotel shuttle DOES, in fact, stop at the Eur Magliana train/metro station. You simply need to wait at the city bus stop and wave it down. Maybe the person who said it did not stop simply did not make their presence known. With people always waiting at the city bus stop for city buses, how is the hotel shuttle driver to know to stop? He will obviously assume you are waiting for a city bus unless you wave him down. It's a big blue bus and you can easily spot it coming. Another option is to take a taxi, because, as we found out, they are VERY cheap in Rome. One morning we had to get up super early to get to the Vatican so a taxi was our only option. We were very pleasantly surprised at how cheap it was. Here's a tip: Don't take those expensive tours on tour buses to see Rome, take a taxi! A taxi ride will also free you from the hotel shuttle schedule. To correct a different reviewer here, there are more than just \"a couple\" shuttle departures from the hotel every day; there are about 6 if I remember correctly. Anyway, 6 will be closer to reality than 2. The shuttle's downtown stop is at the north end of the Circus Maximus. Without a map, you will be lost, and the drivers (at least the ones we had) don't speak English well enough to direct you clearly. Carry a good street map. The closest attraction is the Palatine Hill whose entrance is, unfortunately, on the opposite side of the hill. The Coliseum and Forum are just beyond that. The nearest metro stop is a good hike at the opposite corner of the Circus Maximus. But if you plan on taking the metro, take the hotel shuttle only as far as the Eur Magliana station. The hotel shuttle will stop there if (and only if) you tell the driver you want to stop there.

Feeling tired after a over night train trip, I confined myself to my room and ordered room service. I ordered a cheese and tomato pizza and a side salad. What arrived was a burnt pizza base with just cheese, a bowl of chopped iceburg lettece ( no dressing) and dry stale bread. After complaining to a guest service agent I was confronted by a rude little man who pretended he knew little english. He told me because I was not itallian I did not know that a Tomato and cheese pizza came with no tomato! he left slamming the door and cursing me. The next night we tried the lounge bar, even more of a disgrace, it seemed because we were not wearing dead animal fur that we were not important enough to be served, we had to go and find a waiter for any attention. My club sandwich was okay but the pre used ketchup pottle with an old french fry in it was so revolting. After feeling very much uninvited we left happy to be leaving the next day. On check out we asked to talk to a manager, we meet with the duty manager that was on at the time, she basically said because I worked for starwood hotels I should not expect as good a service as regular guests she basically told us to get lost! in a very typical itallian way.

We could have prebooked the hotel's limosine service for 40EUR, which we took for the return trip to the airport and I highly recommed it. Sheraton is a clean and modern hotel. We booked a junior suite which was a complete waste of money. The standard rooms are large enough, the added sitting room in the junior suite had no windows, virtually no furniture and was a very bleak space which we did not use at all - it would only be of use to families wanting a room for the kids to sleep in. Note there are no tea and coffee facilities in the room which was irritating. The shuttle bus service to the city was prompt and very good. The breakfast was a standard, good buffet. We liked the restaurant for evening meal very much and it was cheap compared to good restaurants in the city. Staff and service were very good. Had a good weekend but would probably not stay at the West Roma again.", "Date": "February 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cAbove Average Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3753757", "Content": "This is a very nice hotel.
