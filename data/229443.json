We were permitted a one hour delay in our check out. The hotel bar was very luxurious feeling. The barman was very accomodating, a simple coffee order was accompanied by beautiful service pieces, chocolates, and fresh fruit. wish we didn't sleep so late so we could have enjoyed the room and hotel more!

The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful - concierge, reception, restaurant, maids. Our (\"superior\") room seemed a little small at first, but it was very comfortably furnished and decorated, and was kept immaculately clean during our stay. The breakfasts are all you could want to start the day - cereals, fruit juices, yoghurts, fresh and dried fruit, fruit salad, a wide selection of bread, rolls, pastries, etc. A hot choice can be made from bacon, sausage, eggs, mushrooms, tomatoes and there is a cold table of various cooked meats and cheeses. The dining room staff were exceptionally attentive to detail and ensured we could have all we wanted to eat. We also ate 2 evening dinners (one on Valentine's night) in the hotel and the food then was second to none for quality and presentation. Overall, we thought the food was exceptionally good. The gym is a little small with a few machines, but quite honestly, if you want exercise do what the Parisiens do and go out for a run on the Champs Elysees or in the Tuileries Gardens - both just a 5 minute jog from the hotel. There are some bars and restaurants nearby, but you have to walk out further to get a greater selection. We feel as if we have stayed in a very traditional Parisien hotel that went out of its way to make our experience of the city very comfortable and enjoyable.

The Hotel Manager was extremely apologetic and seemed almost mortified that there had been a mistake. Unfortunately, there were no Superior rooms available so as a 'compromise' he asked us to stay in the Superior room for two nights and then we would be upgraded to an Executive Suite for the remaining two nights! So, that's what we agreed to and on arrival in the Suite we found we had two full size balconies overlooking the Paris skyline with the Sacre Couer directly infront a few miles away and there was a free half bottle of Champagne as a personal apology from the Manager waiting for us when we got back that evening.

We asked for extra pillows, towels and hangers and it took three calls to get them. We asked the hotel if they could break a 20 Euro in o smaller bills and they claimed they had no change. We asked fora wake up call at 615 AM which never came. The restaurant they recommended for dinner was closed. Thankfully the evening concierge recommended another one that was delicious. The Elevator closest to our room did not work for two days. I had to suggest to them to put a sign up informing their guests, On a positive note: rooms are comfortable and large and clean- however it would be nice to have a clothes line in the bathroom. Matheau in the bar is a delight and we enjoyed eating there for two nights Bottom line- this hotel has real possibility , but the reception desk is so nasty that I would not want to come back.

However I found that I sem to be getting asigned to smaller and smaller rooms and started using a different hotel for business until changin jobs and finding it on the list again! We are paying around 200 euro for a normal queen room but i have to say that I think this is really steep considering that you can only just fit two people in with luggage. Generally the hotel looks like it needs updating and whilst this isnt a deal breaker, there are other hotels for less money that are in better condition. I know it probably osts a lot to redecorate a whole hotel and they must wait until it's so bad they can't avoid it, but seriously...no one wants to see fraying carpet on all the stairs, plug sockets that are loose from the walls, shower heads that wont stay up, TV remotes missing, old TVs, safes with no instructions. None of these ruin a stay but they kinda make you feel silly for paying so much. I've stayed in some 2* hotels in Paris and they have been charmingly shabby with great service. I don't thnk I'll be coming back to the Astor because the service and rooms no longer really justify the 4* price.

She stated that we had already been upgraded and housekeeping could push the beds together...how romantic! When in the room I also noticed damp and mould behind the door which I really don't expect to find in a 4 star hotel. We paid a quarter of the price stated in the hotel room which is perhaps why she had such a bad attitude towards us. But we paid much more than I have ever paid for a hotel in Paris and I would rather have stayed in a 2 or 3 star hotel if they actually gave me a double room like I had asked for! The hotel is located very close to the tourist areas between Champs Elysees and Boulevard Haussman, not the most exciting area of Paris but it explains the high price. Also if you are driving, the hotel has it's own carpark service at 30 euros a night but we parked on the street directly infront of the hotel for free!

Especially as I'd paid extra to upgrade to a superior room (and I confirmed this was a superior room). There was only a couple of feet clearance each side of the bed, and maybe four foot at the end of the bed. The furniture consisted of a desk, wardobe and a small chair as there wasn't room for anything else. Even for a city hotel this was surprisingly small and I can't imagine what the standard room size is like! However, other than the size the standard was very nice and since we spent all our time out and about seeing the sites the size wasn't a problem for us. Everything was very clean and well maintained and it lived up to my expectations in all other areas. Special mention must go to the restaurant, which was excellent. We ate there on our first night as we didn't get in till 9:30. I was just expecting routine hotel fare, so decent but unspectacular.

However, if you're traveling for more than a few days, there are some potential drawbacks. Pros: -Breakfast is included and it is very good -Location-wise, the hotel is close to several Metro stops/lines, but not particularly close to any major sights. I like the flexibility of the Metro, so I prefer being close to that rather than being close to one particular sight. The neighborhood is very safe, with plenty of restaurants/cafes/shopping within easy walking distance. -There's a large grocery store (Monoprix, kinda like a downscaled French version of Target) less than a block away, which is nice if you want to pick up snacks -The rooms were very clean and the bed was plenty comfortable -Staff was nice and spoke English well enough to be helpful -I didn't book/pay for room (business travel) so I don't really know if the rooms are well-priced -Free wireless internet, if you have a laptop. If you're using a PDA/Smartphone for the internet, you'll have to pay, not matter what, which is a definite con. Cons: -My biggest complaint is that this hotel is not particularly good for long stays. I was stuck there for a month and it was kind of a pain. The mini-fridge is tiny and filled to the brim with mini-bar items, so it was difficult to store my own snacks/drinks in there. Also, the laundry prices were INSANE...literally about US $5 to get a pair of socks washed. If you stay longer than a few days, you're going to need to do laundry and the cost is prohibitive and there aren't a lot of laundromats in the area (the concierge laughed at me when I asked). I ended up doing laundry in the tub because I didn't want to blow my entire per diem just to wash my underwear. I expected a big markup, but the prices there blew me away. -I didn't really see any efforts by the hotel to be \"green\" in any way. Even when I left the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door, the maids still came in and changed the sheets and took the dirty towels, even though a towel used once does not need to be washed, IMO. Most hotels these days leave cards instructing guests to hang up towels that they plan to reuse to conserve resources (and cut costs), but no such program exists at the Hotel Astor...so if \"green\" is important to you, you'll have to take that into consideration. -The \"free\" internet suuuucks. Speed is capped at something like 128k/56k down/up, so if you plan to use Skype or telecommute, you'll find it very difficult...doable, but difficult. -If you're using a PDA or smartphone to get on the internet, you have to pay, and it was 9 Euro/24 hours, just for that. If you want to also get the faster data on your laptop, you have to pay separately for that, which was 18 euro a day or 70 euro a week (price is approximate, I don't remember what it was exactly). I realize that a lot of more expensive hotels charge for wireless, but if Motel 6 can offer free WiFi in a $39 room, why do I have to pay for it in a $300 room?", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "BILLDC", "Title": "\u201cSlipped A Bit\u201d", "Author": "BILLDC", "ReviewID": "UR84667461", "Content": "This is the third time we stayed in this hotel.

We were hoping the hotel would meet our expectations having booked it for two stays during our month in Europe. We were not disappointed! The location is fantastic. We walked everywhere...the Eiffel Tower, Musee D'Orsay, Sacre Coeur and Montemarte as well as the Louvre and gardens, the Madeleine, Gallerie Lafayette, Le Printemps, Champs Elysee, Notre Dame and much more. We walked to get dinner each night, walked to go shopping all over and basically saw the best of Paris directly from our hotel. This hotel is located close to the government buildings so it was very quiet on the weekends and into the evening. Since we were there in early August, a lot of Paris is shut down, including a lot of the restaurants, but with the help of the hotel's Concierge we were able to get a reservation at some very good restaurants within walking distance. Now, we don't mind walking....we walked about 6 hours each day, but we found we saw so much more. Paris is not dirty, quite the contrary...they clean the streets every morning. The food is really good and I really crave the baguettes with cheese and tomatoes that you can buy on the street corner. Make sure to have an ice cream cone from the stand across from the Gallerie Lafayette. It is a work of art as they make it into a flower! Take the bateau bus to see life along the Seine. We loved it even though we arrived into a heat wave in Europe (37 C each day when we arrived). Our hotel was quaint and lovely, just what you would expect from a Parisien hotel. We booked two rooms that were side by side (we asked for connecting although I don't believe they exist). They do not have two beds. The rooms are fairly small, but just fine for our stay. The decor was also very Parisien. The breakfast is expensive, but delicious. I still can taste the french pastries and baguettes. If you want a hotel close to all the attractions and don't mind walking, this is an ideal hotel. It is clean, comfortable and very convenient.

We returned at 5 pm, and the hotel manager \"insisted\" on taking us on a tour of their upgraded room -- which by the way would have doubled the price of our room.

We overheard a guest asking for an iron and they told the guest to use their laundry service -- no iron, no ice bucket, no extra towels, nothing. This is pitiful.

The poos technician had to come to the room to confirm that it was indeed the adaptor and not the actual power point. What a bleeding waste of time. Their wifi connection is also another problem. A new password and login name is issued every day. I tried logging on and couldn't. Called the reception for a new password and again there was this defensive tone. The reception actually accused me of not doing it right in spite of the fact that I had repeated the right password. I am usually very patient but this was late at night and I needed to get access fast. Told the reception off and asked for his name and that jolted him enough to give me a new password.

Perfect! Negatives: -The mini bar was super expensive and not extensive - Don't even think about the room service as the prices were ridiculous - The location is not in heart of action.

Overall, I was pleased with the quality of the room and the service. The only thing I didn't like was the hotel receptionist's insistence on my providing a cash deposit of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 a night. (I don't use a credit card and they wouldn't take a Maestro debit card.) Although it's standard practice in many hotels to request a deposit, I felt a little put out that I was being asked to underwrite my prepaid stay with extra cash.

It is our second visit to this hotel. We got a very good rate from the internet which included breakfast . We had a superior , non smoking room which overlooked a central courtyard. It was a good size and very nicely decorated with good quality furniture. The bathroom was not big but perfectly adequate with very nice toiletries and fluffy bathrobes. It is extremely quiet around hotel at night as it is on the edge of business district. However it is a 5-6 minute walk to Place de la Madeleine and another 5 to the Opera. Walking in another direction 3-4 minutes brings you to the Elysee Palace on Rue Faubourg St Honore (one of the best shopping streets in Paris) .We always felt safe walking in the area of the hotel at night. Breakfast was expensive at 25 euros per person, although, there was a good selection of all the usual things. Hot things were on offer as well. The only fault at breakfast time was you were served one cup of coffee and refills were not offered without requesting. Then it took time before the waiter came and served it. although coffee was waiting ready. The highlight of a stay in this hotel is the concierge Dennis . He speaks several languages and has an extensive knowledge of Paris and surrounds. He always was more than willing to give suggestions and explain the history of places he suggested for visits. His recommendations for restaurants were excellent.. He did all our bookings for taxis ,shows etc and there were no hitches. We can't praise him enough. The only big complaint we had was with reception on paying our bill. We told the young lady on reception that we wanted to settle our hotel bill in euros ( we had heard about the illegal con trick of converting into your own currency when you pay with your credit card). They are supposed to ask which currency you wish to pay in. We queried it again as it showed both currencies on the slip and were assured that we had been charged in euros not GBP. This was not true as it had been changed into GBP at a rate of 1.37 euros and the rate we got on our credit card for other transactions in Paris was 1.47 euros. We were just glad we had pre-paid our reservation. SO BEWARE when settling your bill.

We booked it through Expedia and got a special rate which allowed us to have a Superior Room at a rate which was lower than the Standard Room. The rate was for the room only and did not include breakfast as some other packages mentioned on this site. Room: We read many reviews - most of them on Trip Advisor - and found that the actual room was fairly well described by previous visitors. The size of the room was spacious by European standards. We noticed that our bedspread was badly stained and asked that it be replaced, which was done promptly. The chairs were also badly stained, and there were some stains on the fabric wall coverings. Otherwise the room was pretty clean and comfortable for our needs. The bathroom was larger than we expected, and the shower was always plenty hot. Closet space is very limited, and there was no dresser for clothing. Some things just need to stay in the suitcase if you have a lot of clothng. Service: We asked the concierge for a restaurant recommendation one evening, and he booked us into a very nice place which was walking distance from the hotel. We also observed the 3 different concierges helping other guests throughout the week. All spoke English perfectly and willingly, and all were consistently very polite and helpful. Note that you must ask for wash cloths and extra small towels. They are trying to be conservative with water, etc. so they don't load you up with towels. Location: We couldn't have been happier with the location. We were walking distance from many very nice restaurants/bistros and we particularly enjoyed having breakfast at the St. Augustin Cafe - about a 5 min walk - then walking around the corner to the Metro for our day of walking around the city. We discovered a great neighborhood bistro on Haussman called Pomze, with a great menu, decent prices, fun staff and only a 5 min walk from the hotel. There is also a Monoprix market about 3 minutes walking distance. We went there to stock up on water bottles and snacks. The minibar fridge had plenty of space for our stuff. It was particularly nice to be so close to everything but in a very quiet area. Restaurant: We did not eat in the restaurant, but it looked very nice! One note - when we checked out we discovered that our room had been charged for breakfast every day! We pointed it out to the desk clerk who quickly removed it from the bill. She said that it gets charged automatically! We found this to be surprising, so be sure to study your bill when you check out.

We got a good deal by getting three nights for the price of two and breakfast thrown in. It was worth upgrading to a superior room as we had more space in both our room and en-suite. A helpful tip is that rooms on the 3rd, 5th & 7th floors are non-smoking. We had a room which looked out into the courtyard and despite comments from previous guests found our air-con worked fine. The big fluffy robes were nice to relax in after a long tiring day seeing the sights of Paris.

The staff were always helpful and courteous, their English extremely good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although we did try and hold as much of our conversations in French as we could. We found that in respecting their language and culture nothing was too much trouble. As a result of explaining the reasons for our visit beforehand, it was a lovely surprise to find a bottle of complementary champagne in our room upon arrival. We found the breakfast each morning to be very good. Despite some comments from other reviews we did not find anything to complain about and also stoked up so that we could go until late afternoon before needing to eat again. The choice was great with anything from cereal & fresh fruit, cold meats, cheese (just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect cheddar as this is France after all) and salad to bacon, scrambled eggs & hash browns to baguettes, brioche to pastries & waffles. All fresh from the kitchen each day. We have since discovered that even the tea (Marriage-Frere) seems to be one of the best you can get. Once again as we found during our stay the key is to simply ask as nothing appeared too much trouble \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one guest next to us had freshly made hot chocolate instead of tea. Finally the staff were lovely and made sure everything was how we wanted it. The concierge team and in particular Denis were a real credit to the hotel. They were full of knowledge and tips and took a real interest in making sure our stay at both the hotel and Paris was the best it could be. Despite arriving before check in time, they looked after our luggage whilst we went out to explore and similarly upon checking out, which meant we climbed to the top of the Arc de Triomphe without having to cart our entire luggage around with us. As a final tip, let the staff book a taxi to take you back to the airport, you can then relax and enjoy a final afternoon tea and cake (you must try the pancake cake) in either the bar or Hemmingway room.

The concierge, in particular, was always engaging and seemed eager to help us. 3) Everyone spoke English well. My wife and I tried our best French and if that failed, they were able to converse well with us in English. 4) The location was incredibly convenient, as there was a metro stop about 7 minutes away by foot and a Monoprix (supermarket with great pastries and desserts and cheap beverages) about a 3 minute walk from us. Negatives: 1) Our room was situated overlooking a courtyard, which would become fairly noisy early in the morning. 2) All of the doors in the hotel slam shut, which, I suppose is for security reasons. Unfortunately, once people start waking up in the morning at 6 or 7 AM and leave their rooms, the doors slam shut so hard that they often woke us up. 3) Everything at the hotel is fairly expensive. For example, my wife needed some ice because she injured her foot. We went to the bar and asked for some and were instructed to call room service to obtain the ice. We didn't know, until after, that there's a 5 euro charge just for ice!! 4) The rooms were fairly small, though not unusually so by European standards.

Checking in was quick, with excellant english being spoken and we were shown to our room by the receptionist. The room itself was on the first floor, was a nice size, very clean, mini bar, wardrobe, small safe, small tv with english speaking news channels, writing desk. All pretty standard stuff. The bathroom however was very small and an awkward shape. The room was too small for a bath though the large shower was excellant and the fittings were quality. The only problems were the bed which seemed small and the heat. Even in Jan the room was roasting at night and being jan the a/c wasn't on. Our windows (doors) lead out to the patio area so wasn't keen on leaving them open at night. The hotel has a nice intimate bar and the concierge was most helpful in making dinner reservations. The breakfast which was included in our deal was in my opinion very poor. Various pastries, cold cuts and a cooked selection. The pastries were good according to my partner but the cooked option (buffet style) was very poor and the cheeses were like rubber. I certainly would not pay to have breakfast at the hotel. As for its location... less than 5 minutes walk to the nearest metro (Saint Augustin) and the Madeline, Opera, the Louvre and even the Champs elyses all with in easy walking distance. Recomendations - Don't worry too much about location in Paris. If your staying anywhere central you can walk to most attractions and the metro is excellant if its too far or you don't want to walk. We purchased the 10 ticket option on the metro and that worked perfectly. Also went on the open top bus. Usual hop on hop off stlye with 4 routes. Was 28 euros for two days travel (think its 24 or 25 euros for one day) So thought the 2 day option good value, and gave excellant views around Paris. Drinks are expensive so did as another reviewer recommended and went to the supermarket (monoprix) and bought some beers and cokes for the room and put them in the mini bar. Think 6 or 7 euros for a bottle of beer in the bar compared to 3 euros for 6 cans from the supermarket. Food was a bit hit and miss. Over 100 euros in a Brasserie (Le Boeuf sur le toit) for 2 courses with a bottle of wine. Much cheaper went we walked down to the Hard Rock cafe - touristy perhaps but very good. But there are restaurants, bars and cafes everywhere. Finally though there was nothing wrong with the hotel,but I would be looking to stay elsewhere (cheaper) next time. There were loads of decent looking hotels in the area. I don't need a hotel bar or restaurant, would rather save some money and spent it out and about exploring paris, which was by the way fantasic. We did the usual - top of the eiffel tower (fantasic), the Lourve, Notre Dame, Basilique du Sacre-Coeur etc. All off which was good.
