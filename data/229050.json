My bedroom was spartan with minimal furniture, and air conditioning supplied via a very old \u201cthrough the window\u201d unit that rattled whenever the refrigeration element started up. When I first heard it I thought the front grille was loose, but that wasn\u2019t the problem, nor was the filter screen behind the grill. I don\u2019t think that screen could have rattled if it tried: it obviously hadn\u2019t been cleaned for several summers and it was clogged with dust! The initial response of the front desk when I reported the problem was to send up a porter who jammed in a thin strip of wood he went to fetch (I naively thought he\u2019d stepped out to get some tools!), but that didn\u2019t work. I reported the problem to the front desk again next morning, and they said it would be fixed, but it never was. The bathroom was OK except for the shower which was in a square cubicle a maximum of one metre square fitted into a corner of the room. The two sliding doors didn\u2019t close fully, leaving a sizeable gap through which water escaped, making it necessary to lay a towel on the floor before showering to prevent a flooded floor. I have no experience of Italian hotels at all, so I\u2019m not sure if this next item is an example of Canadian expectations running up against what is considered normal in another country, but I found it annoying. My room had absolutely no information in it at all. No phone book, no hotel directory, no instructions on how to use the phone, nothing \u2013 it was absolutely bare! One final demonstration of the poor customer service came on the morning I checked out (July 6). I had been carrying some postcards around for a couple of days and had been unable to buy stamps for them. I asked at the desk if they had any, and the clerk offered to put them through the Hotel\u2019s franking machine and mail them for me. This I agreed to, leaving the cards with him, and paying what now seems to be the postage rate plus an extra Euro for each card. One of the postcards was to my wife: it arrived here on July 27, and when I checked the card (not franked but with ordinary stamps), it was postmarked July 16. I haven\u2019t heard if any of the other cards I sent have arrived, but I assume they also sat in someone\u2019s desk for 10 days or more until they were finally mailed. I have no doubt that the problem with this hotel is that it caters for large tour groups. I was part of a band that was playing at a festival In Rome, and there were four other bands, including three high school bands from the US, in the hotel at the same time, all of us booked in by the same tour company.

You can walk to the Vatican if you are up for a nice long two mile walk, and the area on the way does feel safe even in the evening.

Everything about this hotel was terrible and I would have rather slept on the streets than to stay in this hotel one more night. The room was very dark and outdated and extremely hot. The airconditioning didn't work and the room was uncomfortable. The walls were seriously paper thin and you could hear every word of the people in the rooms on each side of you. (not to mention the anybody talking in the hallway) You could even hear someone tinkling in the toilet in the room next to you. I could seriously hear everyword of the tv program in the room next to door. I know hotels in Rome are old and this is a common problem, but the Princess Hotel was about a million times worse than any hotel I have ever stayed at. We traveled throughout Italy for 11 days and this hotel was downright terrible. Before my husband and I went to bed, we put the do not disturb sign up on the outside of the room. The maid completely disregards the sign and barges in our room before 9AM and then slams the door closed when she realizes we are still in there. HAs she ever heard of knocking? Then, the posted check out time on the back of the door was NOON. We got a call from the front desk at 10:35 telling us check out time was at 10:30 and asking us why we were still in the room. We told them the time posted on the door was noon and they acknowledged this and then stated we still had to be out of the room by 11:30. I didn't want to stay in this hotel a second longer. I was hot and tired and barely slept a wink past 6 AM because of chatter in the rooms next door and hallways. All were heard all morning, were doors slamming and people talking. Even if someone whispered, you would probably been able to hear it. The staff treated us like second class citizens. This hotel is so far off the beaten path, you have to walk 25 minutes down a busy road to get to a train station to take you to anywhere. The shuttle was a complete joke. I don't ask for mcuh out of a hotel room other than a clean, safe place to sleep. I hardly slept a wink between the noise and the heat. The staff were so rude that we couldn't wait to leave this dump. To anyone considering staying in this hotel, please think twice. I know there are nicer hotels in Rome at this price. If you like being treated like dirt and can sleep through an atomic bomb, then this is the hotel for you.", "Date": "May 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scranton, PA", "Title": "\u201cPretty good\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3434825", "Content": "Having read the horror stories, we were apprehensive to say the least.

The hotel is way out of town but this is why it is cheaper. Bring earplugs for all Italy's hotels. I feel this hotel is underrated, and while not the best, is certainly not the mess I expected.

In the hotel description from hotels, it said that is just a few kilometers away from the Vatican and St Peter's. This is the reason why we booked this hotel. During our stay, we were able to prove that the cleaning crew were not changing our bed sheets, and we suspected that the used hand towels which we left in the hanger were not replaced either. Only those towels that we threw on the bathroom floor were changed! Or so we hoped! We arrived into Rome by train. From the Roma Termini station, we decided to take a taxi ride. During the taxi ride, we were so excited seeing great attractions that we would pass by. My wife even urged me to start taking videos! Minutes past and we started seeing residential areas. Soon we realized that we were outside of Rome. We decided to take a look at the tourist map given to us at the information booth from the Termini station. We thought, our taxi driver was taking us for a ride! Sensing that we were suspecting our ride, the driver asked if we were looking for the hotel in the map. We told him yes. He smiled and told us that our hotel was off the map! He assured us that he knows where our hotel was and we should not worry. Indeed, he was able to get us to our hotel without consulting his detailed map nor asking anyone at a metered price cheaper than what was suggested to us by the information agent at the Termini station. Once we arrived at the hotel, the hotel staff were great and very polite. They gave us a version of their tourist map which includes their location. Indeed, this hotel is off the city map! It is not even close to the 3 kilomoter distance as advertised. They even provided us with a hand drawn supplemental map on how to get to the train station from the hotel. However, the hotel provide a free shuttle to and from St Peter's but the first trip we thought is quite late, which is set at 915A. Especially at that time when Rome is bustling with tourist, we thought, it would be too late to be arriving after 9A at St Peter's. In addition, the shuttle bus that they use is just a measely 25 seater bus, with 1 seat missing! During this entire trip, we visited London, Venice, and Rome. In each city, we booked hotels thru hotels at rates that were similar. All hotels were rated by hotels as 3-star and above. Of all 3 hotels that we booked, this is the only hotel that did not include a complimental breakfast. The only thing that is working for this hotel is their friendly and helpful staff. One of them even let us borrow his own umbrella on our last day when it was pouring outside.", "Date": "April 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNot happy\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3332123", "Content": "I don't see how the hotel can be rated as 4*, as it certainly doesn't seem like one to me. 1. The breakfast wasn't free, and they didn't tell us that until we've started eating! It costed like 6 euros per person for some stupid burnt croissants and funny tasting orange juice! 2. Being in the room at night was like being in a sauna, there was no air con nor temperature control, so we were like dehydrating sleeping in that room! 3. The room was so noisy...can hear the people talking next door and the cars and coaches going pass outside. 4. The toliet didn't flush properly, and made a loud scary noise everytime we flushed! 5. The room looked a bit crap, small and undecorated, and no kettle nor cups nor coffee/tea/hot chocolate. 6. The bathroom was way too small, it didn't even have a bath tub. 7. You need to pay 5 euros deposit for this special hotel adapter for your electronic equipments (such as hairdryer)- but this is so silly of them! Why can't we use our electronic products as normal?? 8. The bar only opens from 9.30am to 12pm, and remains shut for rest of day. What's the point?! But apart from that, everything else was ok, the beds were tidied by the maids every morning and bins were emptied, the shuttle bus service was ok too apart from being too small, and the hotel is not too far from vatican (about 45mins on foot).", "Date": "April 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "greece", "Title": "\u201cThe most impolite stuff in Rome!\u201d", "Author": "terina", "ReviewID": "UR2960710", "Content": "I am from Greece, I visited Rome in November 2004 and I stayed in this hotel 4 days.
