We were assigned room 503, and had an amazingly spacious room with a surprise: a large balcony with an excellent view of the surrounding hills, including Tibidabo. The hotel was new and had a modern design, which we enjoyed, although there were a few kinks which the hotel still needs to work out. The hotel was away from down town Barcelona, but the Metro was clean, quick, and efficient so we did not mind the travel, especially with a 3 day travel card. The hotel was an easy 2 block walk from the closest Metro stop (Mundet). Our room had two twin beds put together for a large bed, with a rollaway bed for our son. We also had a chair and foot stool, desk, flat screen TV, and built in closets / shelving with a redridgerator unit. Our room also had small safe. The hotel had free wireless internet service in the lobby, although it was painfully slow. In the rooms, we had to buy internet service (from the desk, via a pre-paid card system). This fee-based wireless internet was much faster, and reasonably affordable EUR 6.00 per 24 hours. Despite being near a highway, the room was rather quiet and we had a peaceful night\u2019s sleep. We used the air conditioning unit, but if we had chosen to leave the windows open, we would certainly have had traffic noise. The bathroom was spacious and new, with ample toiletries provided (even a bath sponge!). We had a large sink with plenty of countertop space, a walk-in shower with a glass side, and a separate room for the toilet with a bidet. Our only complaint about the bathroom was that the water ran out of the shower and flooded into the toilet area, despite our best efforts to manage the direction and speed of the shower. We ate dinner at the hotel restaurant twice, once after our late arrival, and once again when we realized that a nearby restaurant was closed. The food was good quality, although not as interesting in selection as what we found in the center of Barcelona. Our rate also came with breakfast, which was adequate although uninspired compared to other hotels we have stayed at recently. The buffet-style arrangement included eggs, cereal, yogurt, cheese, ham (which was excellent), bread, and fresh fruit. The coffee machine was self service, and frequently ran out of milk. On the positive side, the breakfast room was not overcrowded and we had no issue finding a table each day. The front desk staff was friendly, although not always knowledgeable. At one point, they sent us to a nearby restaurant for dinner which turned out to be closed. And they told us that it would take no more than 40 minutes to reach the airport by train, although it took us nearly double that on our arrival (and we could not figure out a faster way). Upon checkout, we took a taxi from the hotel to the airport. Despite leaving during the evening rush hour, it took us less than 30 minutes to get to the airport. If we saw an excellent value price for this hotel, we would consider staying again. For an expensive rate, it may be more convenient to stay downtown, especially if you are visiting for just the weekend or looking to go out late at night.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cPerfect,clean and comfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "AngelaDimit", "ReviewID": "UR119249643", "Content": "We stayed 4 nights in this hotel.

There is no pool, the restaurant menu is limited and only available at certain times.

As someone who is used to staying in hostels/backpackers I was obviously very impressed with the lovely new facilities, the room was great, had a television, safe, mini-bar, table & chair, very nice bathroom with toiletries provided. Although we booked for a double room we got two single beds pushed together - which wasn't always ideal (!) but the beds themselves were comfy to sleep in. We had breakfast included and it did the job, tea/coffee, lots of greasy meat, fruit/yoghurt/pastries/bread etc. If it isn't included with your room I would consider getting something cheaper though, not sure it would be worth the 14 Euro! The staff were nice enough and helpful. Some staff weren't so good with English but to be fair it might have been my Australian accent they struggled with! As for the location, it is basically next door to the Metro stop Mundet on L3, if you are going for a few days I would recommend buying a T10 travel card. It is about 15mins from Mundet to Catalunya (where you can access Las Ramblas), and because the Metro is so easy to navigate we didn't really find it a huge problem to be on the outskirts of town.

Buy the 10 use pass for the best value. When my son's passport was stolen, the hotel staff researched and gave us detailed directions to the US Consulate. We got there early (8:30 am) and were first in line. It only took 35 min to get a new passport - make sure you take a photocopy of your passport with you. The hotel is quite new and the room sufficiently large. However, there are no comfortable chairs. Of course you wouldn't stay in the room watching TV unless it were rainy outside, so it wasn't an issue for us.

Its true they put a brochure advertising their services and goods price. I've never seen nothing like this and i'm not saying is a bad thing. Just unusual.

I have copied the following bit from someone elses review as the description is spot on - 'Travel to and from the airport is easy and cheap if you take the train, takes around 40 minutes. Take the train to Placias de Gracia and then change over to the L3 line to Mundet. The same metro ticket is valid for the whole travel. Take care that you dont exit the metro station while trying to locate the metro lines during the change. Exit the Mundet metro station on the left hand side (when the platform is behind you) and then turn right after the ramp. The hotel is at the end of the road on the right hand side.' I would say it take about an hour though, not 40 minutes. The food at the hotel is pretty good too which we weren't expecting and a fair price. Turn left at the hotels door as you exit and you will see a large white appartment block. Within the centre of this you will find a large supermarket which stocks everything you need and is pretty cheap. Also, there is a Cafe a bit up from the supermarket in the same square which sells cheap things for breakfast and the people there are very friendly.

Dont expect a 4star hotel service, but the rooms are great value if you want to spend only the nights in the hotel and the days travelling the wonderful city! POSITIVES- Travel to and from the airport is easy and cheap if you take the train, takes around 40 minutes. Take the train to Placias de Gracia and then change over to the L3 line to Mundet. The same metro ticket is valid for the whole travel. Take care that you dont exit the metro station while trying to locate the metro lines during the change. The hotel was in a great location, just 15 mins to City centre (Catalunya) by the metro and the metro station (Mundet, L3 line) was less than 500m away from the hotel! Exit the Mundet metro station on the left hand side (when the platform is behind you) and then turn right after the ramp. The hotel is at the end of the road on the right hand side. Nice locality and there's a very handy supermarket in the basement of the white colored flats opposite the hotel building. The room was very clean, very good size and the bathroom was wonderful! House keeping was also quite satisfactory. NEGATIVES: The desk staff were not very polite or welcoming. We were handed the room keys on check-in and the lady at the desk did not even bother to suggest the floor number for the rooms or the where the lift was. We had requested a double bed in our booking but when we arrived what we got was 2 single beds put side by side. We requested for a double bed again at the reception but again the lady flatly (almost rude) told us that there was nothing else available and she could not do anything about it because it was just a \"request\" we had put and so it was not guaranteed. BIGGEST NEGATIVE - We were carrying travellers cheques and requested those to be encashed at the reception. Everytime (4-5 times for 2 days) the lady available at the reception said that she would not be able to help us and we had to ask at the reception between 11am-2pm in the afternoon! (That meant we had to stay back at the hotel for any proper answer about the cheques and not go out!!!) At another time, another lady told us that they did it only if we had loyalty card or something like that with the hotel!!! How do they expect tourists to have a card with the hotel is beyond my imagination....In the end, we had the travleers cheques encashed at a currency exchange shop.

The hotel is and looks very new and is impressive from the moment you walk in. On the night we arrived, there was actually a local wedding taking place and that gave the place even more credence. The staff were very friendly and check-in was a breeze. There's a central glass lift that goes up the outside of the building and gives a good view of the ample greenery below. We were lucky to be up on the seventh floor and got a great view over the hills on the outskirts of Barcelona. The hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the Mundet metro station which is on the green line 3 and can take you in less than 20 minutes to places like Passeig de Gracia (the main shopping area), La Rumblas, the marina, the magic fountain or to get a connecting funicular (on the same metro ticket) up Montju\u00efc to the castle or Olympic Stadium. It also gives good connections to other areas, such as the beach. Although the hotel is no where near the city centre or beach, we never thought this was a problem as the hotel looks far better than most of the hotel in those areas, plus it's in a very safe area. The breakfasts and other meals are pricey but for breakfast there's a little shop in the metro station where you can get coffee and a croissant for under two Euros. Plus with places like La Rumblas so close by metro it's convenient to eat there instead.

Interior was not too bad for a cheap \"four-star\" hotel, but it was rather simple/cheap and basic for a normal \"four-star\". I'd say it is really a 3-star hotel. Our experience with the staff for the whole stay was good. The most disappointed thing about the hotel was the facility provided in the room. The mini-bar only had a mini-fridge and 2 glasses. There was no kettle at all. Even the 3-star hotels I stayed in before had kettles!! I asked for a kettle, but they didn't understand this, so I didn't bother asking for one at the end.

Seeing these 2 important aspects that were not good in providing a basic, enjoying stay, I feel the toiletries they provided were a bit excessive. A sponge for shinning shoes and one other thing that I couldn't even remember that I didn't even find them in other 4-star hotels.

It was in a cornor in the lounge area on the ground floor and there was only 1 computer and a printer (for all the guests usage?) We tried to print something but the printer only rolled and didn't print. There was probably no ink...? At some point, I did feel this hotel was a practice hotel for Barcelona University hotel management graduates, where their campus was just located opposite to the hotel courtyard. Although the campus does have its own entrance on the opposite side of the block for students but because the courtyard are connecting the hotel lounge and the back of the campus, and the reception for the exhibition was in the hotel lounge, some visitors who were going to an exhibition in the campus did have to go through the lounge area in the hotel first. Generally, the hotel room space & interior were OK, not bad staff service, but some important in-room facility was not good. For the price we paid, it was fair - we stayed for 3 nights and our third night was free because of promotion. The price we paid were only for room though. They charged about 13 euro each for a buffet breakfast. I couldn't make any comments on their breakfast because we didn't want to pay that much for it.

And one tiny shop which closes at like 7, which we just managed to get to. The metro stop is a 3 min walk which is perfect and 12 mins into las ramblas. The metro is fab, and v cheap.

They originally promised to refund the room they didn't give us for the first night (this is confirmed by several staff and they also offered breakfast and room upgrade as an apology for sqeezing 4 of us into one room). After we went back home, they said the breakfast and room upgrade they offered should be more than enough to compensate the room charge! We were trying not to let this incident ruin our mood, but they just kept irritating us (except one staff called Alberto who was friendly and responsive). When we talked to the front desk supervisor in our last date for the refund, we felt like a group of beggers causing troble and asking for money. Below please find the email I sent to their GM at 2am in the first night. Subject: To GENERAL MANAGER of ALIMARA Hotel - SERIOUS COMPLAIN FROM HOTEL GUEST Dear Sir/Madam, I'm your existing hotel guest staying in room 129 and I'm furious and disappointed by your poor service and disaster recovery. We reserved and confirmed 2 double-bed rooms from May 2 - 6th nearly a month ago, and I can't believe that this is what I have got: 1. Your first front desk staff only offered one room (number 419) and told us the hotel is full when we checked in at 10:30pm on May 2nd; 2. Your front desk supervisor made an excuse (electricity problem in one of our rooms which the first front desk staff never mentioned) and asked another couple of our group to take the taxi and stay in another place. Even after we kept saying that we were really tired and would really want to stay only in this hotel, the supervisor still wanted the another couple to move; 3. 4 of us had no choice but demanded an additional bed to stay together in one room. And surprisingly, your front desk asked us to stay in another room (room 129) so as to set up the bed. Is this a joke? because they have 2 rooms indeed and only assigned us in either one room!!!! 4. The extra bed was delivered only 40 mins after we got in by your SECURITY GUARD and no one made the bed sheets. So your staff were expecting us to set up the extra bed at 11:15pm on our own in this so-called 4 star hotel? I could't sleep until now because of the poor arrangement from your hotel and I really don't think we deserve this from our holiday.

Take the train from the airport to Sants station (the stop is labled \"Barcelona\" on the train's display), it will take about 20 minutes. There are 2 trains an hour leaving at :00 and :30. Then take the Metro green line #3 (direction Canyelles) to Mundet metro stop. Walk left out of the station, then turn right and walk to the end of the block. It takes just a couple minutes to reach Hotel Alimara from the metro station. As another reviewer mentioned, the Consum Supermarket is very close by.

And the majority of the positive reviews convinced us. We noticed thought that almost 3 years ago, there were some people not happy with their stay... So hear now what we have to say about our stay here. First of all, this so called 4 star hotel is badly located. It's in the north of the city, right to the circular highway surrounding the city. What does this means? Yes, it's quite noisy, so if you still want to go, be sure to ask for the room to be furthest possible from the highway (on the right side as you face the hotel). But don't bet your money that they will provide you with the room you asked for (we asked for a double room, got a twin one instead (it has happened, by the way, in all the hotels we had stayed before); however, the rest of the hotels gave us a double room when we had politely pointed out that this was our initial request; Alimara was the only hotel that refused that request, claiming that \"no other double rooms were available). It is true however that the hotel is quite close (less then 5 mins waling) from the Mundet subway station on the 3rd line) which allows you to get quickly downtown. I recommend using the subway: even if tempted to walk, you'll soon find out that your plan didn't indicate that in order to get to the city center you'll have to cross the hill where the Guell park is located, and the streets are quite steep. Getting back to the hotel, the reception was quite glacial when I refused to provide them with the credit card details. They claimed that this way they were trying to insure we were going to pay the extras (like minibar and Pay TV). I insisted that we did not intend to consume anything from the minibar or to wath Pay per view. To this, they claimed that this was \"the standard procedure across Spain\" (fact denied by local Spanish relatives I asked). Finally, they gave up this request. As I've already said, breakfast is not included, but I won't recommend to pay 11 \u20ac / person / breakfast. Instead, wake up at 9, go out from the hotel, go left, cross the street, then take the stairs down, go underneath the building and you're in a space with residences around. There underneath you'll see the entrance to a Consum supermarket, where you'll find what you'll need for quite a fine and cheap breakfast (and lunch and dinner, also). The rooms are spacious though, but then you'll have the same thing I've seen in quite all the hotels I've been to: you need your unlocking card to be plugged in in order to have electrical power (however the air conditioned and the minibar seem to have their own circuit (we found the air conditioning running after room cleaning ladies passed and the things we left in the minibar were cold). About the Pay TV, there seemed be a bug in their system, and if you played a little with the remote you may be able to access directly the channels where the movies play (normally not directly accessible) without having to pass through the outrageous expensive Pay per view channels (10.70 \u20ac / movie). (They claim that in order to have Pay TV disabled in your room, all you have to do is to ask the receptionist; I did, but of course, he did nothing, even if he claimed the contrary). When checking out, we once again had a hard time explaining we didn't want to be in their \"computerized guest database\", that we didn't want to receive any offer from their part. One of the receptionist said \"well, if you want to be removed, just call us\", to which I said \"what's the point into calling you later, I'm telling you to remove my information NOW!\" The lady didn't seem to get it, so he asked another male coworker (who by the way had trouble to explain to a German couple that were checkouting too, and were about to discover that their advertised price was without VAT) and he assured me that any information about me was going to be removed (and sure, he was going to do that, just like his other colleague disabled the Pay TV). All in all, we had quite an unpleasant experience, and we don't recommend this hotel, who definitely doesn't deserve its 4 stars.", "Date": "August 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, Great value!\u201d", "Author": "KamaLinn", "ReviewID": "UR8226602", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel in June for 2 nights.

It had a shower with a tub (the first one of these we saw in Europe)! The room was very clean and very nice. There was a minibar and room service.

It looked like most of the trams were new. The stations were listed on the tram and would light up as you got to the station, so it was very easy to use.

Had tried to source for a good and cheap(er) hotel in the city but nothing decent was within budget. That said, we were a bit apprehensive with the booking, as it was quite far from the city centre. However, the short 2-minute leisure walk from Mundet metro station, which is on the green L3 line, made up for it. We actually asked for a double bedroom non-smoking, but got a twin room instead. We called to change and after a while, they gave us a smoking floor. There wasn't that lingering smoke smell, so we decided to take it. The rooms were very spacious, and some even had access to the balcony (for smokers). We stayed on the 5th floor, which was a little noisy (but bearable) from the Highway traffic. Pillows were very longish and flat (weird), so had to ask for 2 more pillows. But the bed was comfortable. Bathroom was huge and I do feel that they could have made better use with the space to afford a bigger toilet area. It was difficult closing the door with the bidet blocking access. Didn't have breakfast with the hotel, or try their restaurant, so I cannot comment. Overall, the hotel is conveniently located close to the metro, and on a L3 line which is directly accessible to city centre. It's about 15 minutes to Catalunya & Passeig de Gracia. The area surrounding the hotel is a quiet residential area, with a school and university (toursim) building. No other hotels around though. It's not the type of hotel to laze around in, the beach would be better for that. Price should be about EUR 120, without breakfast. Only problem is you have to watch what time the metro trains end, or you'll have to catch a cab back, which is not entirely cheap. I would definitely return to use the hotel, if they don't jack up their prices, unless I want to explore a different part of Barcelona. If you are the sort that would party way past midnight, I would suggest somewhere more central, so you get back easily.", "Date": "June 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "SmitEnglish", "ReviewID": "UR7711115", "Content": "Had a good time at this hotel which is very easy to commute to the central Barcelona via the Metro (Mundet Station on the Green Line 3).
