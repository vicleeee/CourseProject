We started the tour 2 weeks prior in Madrid but stayed at a different hotel- The Atocha. The Atocha was a superior hotel. The Agumar is only a 2 star hotel. My husband and myself were worried about this hotel since he wrote the hotel 5 times before he received a response. He wrote 4 times in March and he tried again in June. He was writing to ask the hotel the best way to get to the airport and to request a non- smoking quiet room with a queen sized bed if possible since this was an anniversary trip for us. In June they finally responded about the transportation, but made no mention of his other requests. We arrived at the hotel about 7PM on Sat. Aug. 4. We had to hurry to get dressed since our farewell dinner was at the hotel at 7:30 PM. When I opened our door to our room I immediately smelled a strong odor- something had been sprayed into the room to cover up the odor in the room. I wondered what odor they were trying to hide when I noticed an ash tray in the room. This was a smoking room! I got dressed for dinner and when I opened the door into the hallway I could smell cigarette smoke in the hallway. They had put the entire Globus group on a smoking floor!I couldn't believe it! We opened the terrace door and put on the a/c to try to get the smell out of our room. I would have asked for a different room, but we had no time to change rooms. We had the farewell dinner and by the time we got back to our room it was 9:30. We had to get up at 5:30 to get to the airport. 7:30 was our farewell dinner. Another Globus group I think it was the Iberian vacation was having their welcome dinner at the same time. It was a dinner buffet. The food was awful. It was fish which had bones in it, garlic chicken, pasta with fish sauce on it (I am allergic to fish). There were also cold meats, cheeses and breads. We also had a pitcher of sangria for 6 people. I kept comparing this hotel to the Atocha which we had at the beginning of this tour- There was absolutely no comparison. Re: the room- My husband had requested a queen or at least 2 double beds since it was our anniversary trip. Instead we had 2 tiny single beds with a telephone in between so you could not put the beds together.The beds were very plain looking without bed spreads. Wifi was 6 euro for 1 hour. We paid the fee so we could print our boarding passes. We asked the person at the desk to print our passes for us, but he was not helpful. We did find one helpful person- there was 1 nice gentleman who helped us to use the computer and printer. Pros at this hotel- 1) Location - walking distance to Atocha station and the metrobus to get to the airport. 2) Take away breakfast was Ok. They packed us a bag breakfast to take to the airport which consisted of juice, water,cake, and a ham and cheese sandwich which was OK 3) nice sized soap in an individual box. Cons at this hotel 1) They put everyone on our tour on a smoking floor without asking 2) Dinner buffet- poor 3) Rooms had only 2 single beds Would I recommend this hotel?- I am sorry to say no. I have rated many hotels on Trip Advisor and this is the first hotel I have given a poor rating to and would not recommend- especially since my husband wrote 5 e-mails to the hotel asking for directions and specifically requesting a non smoking room with a queen or at least a double bed for the end of our anniversary trip. I am sorry that Globus did not use the same hotel as our welcome dinner the Atocha. Many others on our tour felt the same way as we did. If you are on a Globus tour and this is one of your hotels I would 1) Insist on a non smoking room before you take the key unless you are a smoker. 2) Ask about the type of bed they are going to give you.", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cClose to museums but not centrally located\u201d", "Author": "Family_from_NJ", "ReviewID": "UR137306117", "Content": "We stayed here with a tour group.

It is close to Atocha Station (5 min) and Old Madrid is a short taxi ride (< 7 EUR) away. There is a disco right at the premise. Music played late and kept many people up at night. So if you are staying here, ask for the higher floor. There is a grocery store right across the street. Internet costs 3 EUR/if you use their PC (with a printer) on the lobby. Else, it is 6 EUR/day.

The area near the hotel doesn't offer anything, apart a small shop where you can buy water, biscuits, etc. without spending a lot more buying these things at the hotel. The check in and the check out have been very efficient and without problems and the staff was very friendly. Both the hall and the room were very elegant and there were a lot of services available.

The first 4 nights we had a very clean room (620) with parquet floors and two twin beds that had been pushed together to make a \"double\". The beds tended to move around a bit, as they slid easily on the parquet. But the parquet was nice and clean, bath was clean and somewhat updated, and the A/C worked great! The hotel was ~5 min walk to the Atocha Renfe metro stop and ~10 min to the train station. The Aeropuerto Express bus to/from the airport stops at the train station and only cost 5 euro. Based on the cleanliness and convenience of the hotel, we booked the Agumar again for our last night, but the room we got on our last night (305) was on a different floor and different side of the hotel. It smelled noticeably smoky in the hallway - though not as strong in the room and it got better once we turned on the A/C. The room had cheap carpet, so didn't seem as clean and bright as our first room. I had requested a double, but the twin beds this time were separated by a nightstand. Fortunately we were only there one night. The breakfast buffet was quite excellent - nice spread of hams, chorizo, and cheeses; hot items including fried eggs, bacon, potatoes, tortillas; breads, pastries, fruit, yogurts and cereals; juices, water, and coffee. Wi-fi also worked pretty well although it's 6 euro/24 hr period and can only be used on one device at a time. Overall, a decent, efficient, no frills stay.

It was not too expensive, and we got it very last minute. Amenities are limited, but it was not bad. The location should not be too much of a turn-off as the metro (subway) system is good, and it was not that difficult to get to the different stations, and everywhere around the town. Two stations near the hotel on line 1 are Atocha Renfe and Menendez Pelayo. If you decide to take the train to the hotel from the Airport and you get to Atocha - you really don't need to take a taxi - it is a 5-7 minute walk. The room was not too big, but it was enough for us, and we were not spending that much time at the hotel. Two of the beds were not bad for sleeping (twin size), the third one was an \"arm-chair\"-bed, which was not very good for the back. The bathroom is large, and has most things needed, but there was almost no pressure for the water (on the 5th floor) - so showers took a while. We were there in December, so the heating was on (good), and made the air a bit \"dry\", so we opened the windows to let a bit of fresh air in, which could make it a bit noisy from the traffic on the street. When we were checking in the staff was not too friendly, in fact they seemed a bit preoccupied with other things (not sure what) but definitely not our arrival, and they did not speak English. The only information provided upon our request for a map was a brochure of attractions around town. On our check-out however they were very helpful, and friendly, and the reception was full of different brochures, and maps... so I guess it depends on who's at the desk. There are different buttons to call the 3 available elevators, I don't know how this made sense... which was slightly confusing in the beginning, but overall - not a big deal.

I would say that the hotel needs a bit of modernising especially in the floor corridor areas and somewhat in the room as the d\u00e9cor was a bit bland and the curtains were a little old world. However saying all of that the room was clean (which counts for a lot for me) and tidy. A lot of people have commented on the lack of free Wi-Fi and I think that is something they could introduce. The only other gripe I had was there was little English speaking TV and it would have been nice in the absence of this to have the option to get English Subtitles. Overall it was a good trip. Depending on how long you are going for, we purchased the 13 euro 3 day travel pass which was great as it took us from the Airport to Atocha. It is important to note that you can get the airport bus to terminal 4 to take the Renfe (Overground Train) or to terminal 2 to get the metro. I would suggest doing the earlier (especially if you have bags) as the walk from terminal 1 to 2 feels like an age and there 2 changes on the metro to get to Atocha whereas the Renfe will take you there directly (at a slower pace) but in comfort and with less hassle and when you get out of the station the hotel at a stretch is only around 3 minutes away. Some people commented about the hotel not being in a central location but it is only 4 stops from Sol (which is one of if not the main area for activity) and we actually walked it there in 20 minutes once we knew the direction we were going in. If you like sights I would suggest doing the madrid tour and going to the Bernabeu stadium which even my wife thought was great and she is not a football fan.

Rooms and bathrooms are good quality, with standard satellite TV, minibar, and usual extras. Breakfasst is extra, though we never actually availed of it - since Madrid has so much to offer by way of cafes, bars and other eateries. The hotel - though close enough to the city centre - has a local neighbourhood feel to it. and seemed to attract lots of locals to its Salsa Dancing nigthclub, which seemed very popular (didn';t go there ourselves) A couple of minor quibbles: - Two of the three levators were out of order for the weekend, whioch became a bit of a nuisance after a while: - We requested a smoking room, since my wife is a lifelong tobacco addict. However, the room smelt like an ashtray. The smell of stale tobacco seemed to be embedded into every fabric of the room, and was quite overpowering - even though I have co-habitated with a smoker for most of my life.

The hotel location is ok - walking distance to a metro station and the nearby Retiro park. When we arrived, the staff didn't even offer to take our bags or suitcase up to our room - despite there being plenty of staff doing nothing. There were no coffee / tea making facilities in the rooms (no kettle, mugs etc) which was shocking for an apparently 4 star hotel. The rooms were too hot and stuffy in the evenings as the air conditioning had been purposely switched off centrally by the staff - we complained about this but were told it was tough. We ended up having to keep our balcony doors open to ventilate the room. We were actually lied to by the staff and told originally that the Air Conditioning was faulty and that a repair man would be repairing it after we left - however, we later found out from other staff that the hotel had actually switched off the Air Conditioning on purpose throughout the entire hotel and that they would not be switching it back on on until May the following year (7 months later!) - this was just to save money... We were extremely angry about this and shocked as you would expect. All the rooms were advertised as having Air Conditioning when we made our booking and we would never have booked had we known there would be no Air Conditioning. The people in other rooms in our corridor were also unhappy with the air conditioning situation. The room itself wasn't too bad - although it was pretty small for 2 people. There weren't many english channels on the TV, the BBC World news channel was all we could really watch which was disappointing. The safe in the rooms was not included in the price. The balcony was absoutely tiny (could barely fit 2 people standing on it), however, it was nice to be able to stand there in the evenings and overlook the busy street. Street noise is loud all day and night infront of the hotel - we had bin men shouting at 3AM and collecting bins and police always going past the hotel with their sirens on throughout most nights. Be warned that the windows do not keep all the street noise out and the street infront of this hotel never sleeps. The room walls are paper thin - we could hear the person next door constantly talking on the phone and her TV could be heard loudly in our room throughout the night - this was very disappointing. The bedding, towels and soaps were changed regularly, however, both myself and my wife had loads of bites and itching from the bed - we were both convinced that there were bed bugs or mites in the bed... The bed was comfortable, however, it kept moving across the room everytime anyone moved slightly. The bathroom was extremely old and outdated and in dire need of an urgent refit - probably one of the worst shower / baths I've seen in any hotel. The hotel is very overpriced and didn't even include breakfast for the price. The staff weren't very helpful or friendly apart from one of the doormen who was excellent and helped us alot. There were no computers to access the internet, so if you don't bring your own laptop, you won't be able to access internet from this hotel. Again this was disappointing for a 4 star hotel. Personally, I would class this hotel as a 2 star hotel at most - I have stayed in many 3 star hotels with more facilities than this hotel and nicer rooms and bathrooms. It is definitely NOT a 4 star hotel.

Our booking was through an agency, saving a considerable % on the hotel 'rack rate', and not surprisingly perhaps we were allocated a room on the first floor facing the main street, along which traffic never ceases, so noise was an issue. On close examination it quickly becomes obvious that the four stars that the hotel claims must be well past their sell by date! No tea or coffee making facilities in the room, some facilities didn't work, the staff were not particularly friendly or helpful and there was a general feeling of tiredness about the whole place. The worst experience of our short stay was the restaurant however. Originally we had decided to eat in the cafeteria, not wanting a full-blown meal, but at 7.45 were told that the kitchen serving the cafe was about to close, strangely enough co-inciding with the opening up of the much more expensive restaurant. Throughout the hotel the cafeteria is posted as closing at 23.30 so it wouldn't be unreasonable perhaps to expect that food would be available until maybe an hour or so before close, but apparently this was not the case. The weather outside was anything but pleasant so we opted for the restaurant instead. Bad move, and the fact we were the only two guests dining in there that night should have been a warning. Those 'in the know' don't go there. The mixed grill (x2, at \u20ac18 pp + 7% iva) was barely luke warm, the majority of the items were either tough, full of gristle and fat or just completely tasteless, and I sent my meal back to the kitchen virtually untouched. I have worked in the catering industry in a number of kitchen environments and can honestly say that if I had ever sent such a meal to a table I would not expect to be employed by the end of the night. What made things worse was that upon coming out of the restaurant there were people enjoying food in the cafeteria area, so we had been deliberately misled (some might say lied to) by the staff - and it cannot be put down to a language problem as we both live and work in Spain, and are pretty fluent with the language. I complained at some length but was met with an attitude even less satisfying than the meal - and on checking out in the morning the full meal price was on the bill.

Boy was i wrong. whoever wrote them earlier reviews needs to recheck a few things. Upon arrival at the front door we were greeted by two lovely polite and well dressed doormen who took our bags straight to our room. check in was a breeze which was great considering my spanish was limited to some phrases from cowboy movies. We were put in 4 rooms at the end of a hallway where we felt we had the run of the place, the room had a safe (deposit for the key) a well stocked and reasonably priced mini bar, tv with lots of channels(some english & german) and two beds in a well spaced out room. Much more than the hostel I was expecting after reading some reviews. The hotel is located about 10 minutes from Atocha Renfe station which is one of the major stations and the one we used as our base for transport to the rest of the city. and the metro for \u20ac1 pre ride couldn't be cheaper, although the taxi fares were hardly bank breaking either. I've seen this hotel advertised for \u20ac150 a night which I thought was reasonable but I was even more pleased considering I got a rate of \u20ac65 per room per night. which personally I think is a steal.

I booked using bancotel and paid 50 euros per night.", "Date": "August 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSuperb Hotel\u201d", "Author": "JayJayM", "ReviewID": "UR3639473", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for a week and it couldn't have been better, it was ideally located for the metro. The hotel was lovely and clean, our room was cleaned every single day but we were never disturbed by cleaners when we slept until the afternoon. It was quiet, had everything we needed and we had no complaints at all. The staff were efficient, the restaurant, which we ate in once and it was quite late at night served us with a lovely meal and excellent wine. I think the people who may not have enjoyed this hotel are probably used to the 'holiday beach resort' type hotel and need to remember this is a city centre hotel more set up for business trippers than the 'benidorm crews'.", "Date": "July 6, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Agumar Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d228490-Reviews-Agumar_Hotel-Madrid.html", "Price": "$82 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Paseo Reina Cristina 7</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28014</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "228490", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/de/5c/de5c2f7ad3548ae2d7ffdec27a512e417large.jpg"}}
