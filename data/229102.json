In a frenetic city, this hotel is quiet and unassuming but very comfortable and bang in the middle of all the attractions. Our room was on the top floor overlooking the courtyard and the only noise that woke us was my alarm clock. It was so peaceful. As everyone says, the location literally could not be better. Seconds from Trevi fountain, a few minutes from Pantheon and Piazza Navona and maybe 15mins to Colosseum and Forum. We didn't use public transport or taxi once apart from the 175 bus from Termini Station to the hotel. We walked everywhere easily - even to the Vatican and Trastevere (which was lovely) and it was no problem at all. Beds really comfortable - bathroom well equipped although bath and shower not that spacious. Rooms spotless. Breakfasts wonderful - you could really fill yourself up to take you pretty much through the day. Lots of reasonable restaurants a couple of minutes walk away. Staff unobtrusive but helpful if you needed assistance. If I was being very picky I would say that the breakfast room could do with brightening up a bit as it was a bit drab but this is not a problem in any way.

By far, the best thing about this hotel is its location. Step out the front door, look right, and you can see the side of the Trevi Fountain, mere steps away. You can get to the Spanish Steps, and two metro stations in about 10 to 15 minutes, and another 5 minutes walk will put you at the Colosseum and fora. There also appears to be a lot of great shopping a few minutes away if that's your thing. We booked a junior suite and it was perfect for our needs. We had a small sitting room, separate bedroom, and large bathroom. The bathroom had both a tub with shower and a separate shower stall, which was a little on the small side but fine. There was a very generous vanity with double sinks, which was really great for two people getting ready to go out. There was lots of storage for clothing, as well as space to lay out stuff. The closet also had a programmable safe. I will echo other comments about the beds - the bed was definitely the hardest I have ever come across. I still have sore spots from the bed after two nights away from the hotel. I would still go back, but I might take something to make the sleeping a little more comfortable. The room was scrupulously clean when we arrived, and was kept so during our stay. Breakfast was in a large room in the lower level, and in addition to the usual continental offerings, you could get scrambled or hard-boiled eggs and bacon. The pear yogurt was wonderful, and the food was plentiful. Unlike some other reviewers, we found the hotel staff to be friendly, professional, and always willing to assist. I was very ill for part of the time we were in Rome, and the staff was really helpful when we needed some assistance. I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable, clean hotel in central Rome.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockville, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location\u201d", "Author": "WittyCutie", "ReviewID": "UR126216771", "Content": "This hotel is neighbor to one of my favorite attractions in Rome, the Trevi Fountain (Fontana di Trevi). I usually favor chains that I know (Marriott, Fairmont, Sofitel, Best Western, etc), but this time I went with this unknown brand and was not disappointed. (By the way, it seems that the \"delle Nazioni\" is also a chain, but mostly known in Italy). Added bonus: since the Trevi Fountain itself is within walking distance of the Spanish steps, that makes 2 for the price of 1. You can linger at the Trevi Fountain in early morning before the crowds, and finish your day sitting on the spanish steps after a late supper in a nearby \"trattoria\". Also, there's a taxi stop about 25 meters from the hotel (on Ave. Tritone) so finding a cab is never a hassle. Also Ave. Tritone is a very passing street served by many buses. So, if you're staying long enough and can figure out the bus system, it's worth taking buses. The rooms are small by US standards, but fairly big for Italian hotels, and huge if compared to French hotel rooms. The breakfast buffet at the hotel was enough for me (I'm always on a diet) as well as the girls (cereals and the likes), but it may seem lacking for some. They do have eggs, but that's about it in terms of \"hot\" items. The restaurant staff and the concierge were very friendly and helpful. But one lady at the front desk (the one with whom you settle your bill) seems like she couldn't wait to get rid of us. Eating: The hotel has one restaurant, but it's closed between 3h30-5h30pm. We arrived around 4pm, very hungry and tired, but had to go out to eat. Unfortunately, the restaurants near the Trevi Fountain don't seem to be that great: they don't have to be to attract traffic, (Same with St. Peter's square near the Basilica). By contrast, ALL the restaurants on Piazza Navona are top-notch. So, I suggest eating in places like Piazza Navona, where the restaurants actually constitute 50% of the place's attractions, and you can still listen to some quartet performing. The hotel doesn't offer much to families with young children. So, if you have small kids with you, I suggest you stay with the mainstream Marriott, where you'll have a pool for them. But if your intent is just to \"roam through Rome\" and take in everything that city offers, you will have a great stay.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cNot helpful or friendly\u201d", "Author": "730LovedItaly", "ReviewID": "UR125701827", "Content": "This was the third hotel my husband and I stayed in on our recent 10 day trip throughout Italy.

A second time I asked for help, I asked for a restaurant recommendation near the Pantheon.

It is literally just round the corner from the Trevi Fountain. We stayed for a long, snowy weekend for the Six Nations, and were very pleased with both the service and facilities at the hotel. The staff were friendly and professional - we didn't recognise any of the probelms with attitude referred to in some earlier reviews. When we arrived we were upgraded - this may have been because we specially requested a room with a view into the internal courtyard (as recommnded by earlier reviews). The room was very spacious and spotless, albeit a little dark (only 3 side lamps - no overhead light). The bed was huge and really comfortable. I agree with earlier reviews that the shower is somewhat on the tiny side, but we soon got used to it! The breakfasts are great - eggs and bacon, and the usual enormous array of cereals, fruit, yoghurts, breads, cheeses, meats, etc, etc. One of the best features of the hotel is the location - very central, and close to some lovely little restaurants/ trattorias. Close by too to some of the main tourist attractions like the Pantheon and Piazza Navone (2 beers on the square - 16 euros - but almost worth it for the people watching!). Can recommend Cafe Lo Zozzone behind St Agnes church on Piazza Navona - walk down the little side street (Via de Cupis) and look out for it on your left - it's weeny but the best lunch we had in Rome.

The hotel is four star and lives up to it's status. Our group of six all went for the superior rooms, which didn't disappoint. The showers are small however and we are all slight built! The location was great, with the Trevi Fountain just at the bottom of the street. The closest Metro station is well within walking distance, as are some great bars, restaurants and sights. Our one disappointment however, was when checking out we were issues with a 18 Euro bar bill. Whilst we did have a few drinks in the bar on the first night, my husband and I paid cash -therefore had no outstanding bill to pay and had not even given out our room number. When we explained this to reception, they said the bar was closed at that time and they were just told what to charge. Therefore, we had to pay up. This is nothing compared to the treatment others received in our group. They were issued with a 54 Euro drinks bill for the first night and 14 for the second. They also paid cash for most drinks and only charged two or three to their room on the first night. Yet did not even go to the hotel bar on the second night. When they challenged reception about this, they too received the same response - albeit were let off the 14 Euro bill with the comment, it may have been written down wrong or someone may have given your room number instead! Therefore, we collrctively left 72 Euros lighter, paying for drinks we didn't have. A sour taste left, after such a great weekend. We fear that all drinks were perhaps paid for in cash (God knows where it went) and then charged a second time to our rooms.

Pros: - LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION - Excellent location right near Trevi fountain, easy walking distance to spanish steps, piazza venezia, pantheon and piazza navona. - excellent rooms - we booked a superiour room and a single room - both were adequatley sized and with a nice balcony (not much of a view even though on the top floor). rooms seem well maintained and recentley refurbished with LCD TV and a mini-bar. - price - at the price we booked this is one of the more reasonably priced hotels in that area. cons: (these seem a bit small or petty but sometimes it's the little things that you really need and make the difference between good and great...) - breakfast - although breakfast was quite good it was not the \"feast\" some revieweres claimed - only one hot dish, only couple of cheeses, only one type of bread etc. you won't go hungry but it's a bit basic... -rooms: bed - the bed was quite hard, not prevented us from sleeping but simply not comfortable... -rooms: coffee/tea facility - even though it's not included in the room description we wrongly assumed that there would be such facilities in the room. the lack of such basic facilities is not critical but again impacts the feel of a \"great\" room/hotel. bathroom: Shampoo was dreadful. now if I would have read this in a review i'd probably laugh but having only one kind of shampoo/soap which literally makes you feel less clean you start to get a little annoyed. we even considered going out and buying a new shampoo... internet service: again not something we picked up from the description when booking but there's no WIFI available in the rooms, only in the lobby for additional charge. in addition there's no internet station available at all - only at additional charge. this seems minor but it's really below standards as any decent hotel offers either free wifi or free internet station at the lobby. Service - service was mediocore - even though they booked tickets for us which helped a lot, service was usually without a smile and no help was offered when we asked for map, directions, recommendations etc. late check-out was priced at 100 euros which is also a bit too much (basically a night rate). All in all this is a very good hotel with only minor flaws which can be overcome or overlooked but if they'll be fixed it'll be a truly amazing place... Tips: The gallery Cafe across the street has excellent cappuchino and offers free wifi - great place to start/end your day. the store right next to trevi fountain has really good prices when compared to other places nearby - great place to buy drinks, snacks and light food at the start/end of the day.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful experience and great location\u201d", "Author": "Cheryl L", "ReviewID": "UR122279270", "Content": "My husband, daughter and I went to Roe over the Christmas holidays.

Our children had an internal room on the inside, which was on the first floor and they could simply open the window and 'hop' out into the courtyard. On both of our stays we faced the building next door but that wasn't a problem as I've lived in cities most of my life and the noise really isn't that bad. All rooms were comfortable and out of the 11 in our group - no complaints. As for location you're about 80-100 paces from the Trevi Fountain deoending on your size. You're also within easy walking distance to many other of the prime Rome attractions. If you don't mind using the buses one of the local terminals is about 2 minutes from the hotel and using them isn't a problem. We found the staff to be friendly and attentive and more than happy to assist, but I will agree that the night staff are better at doing this than the day staff. Their English is OK and one of us spoke fluent Italian, so we had no difficulties with directions and recommendations from the staff. As I said when I started, we stayed here twice and I would stay here again. It has a great location, good staff, clean rooms, and isn't overly expensive for the center of Rome. Ignore the noise and enjoy your stay, maybe have a night cap before bed. A city without noise isn't a city. As they say Rome is the Eternal City.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maidstone", "Title": "\u201cPerfect\u201d", "Author": "NiceCheese", "ReviewID": "UR119222195", "Content": "I stayed here recently for a short break to Rome with my girlfriend.

We had a slightly odd one that was in a corner on the second floor and as such had a longer private corridor into the room from the door and windows on two side. The room was gorgeous!

It is also within walking distance to the Spanish Steps, Pantheon, Wedding Cake, Pizza Navona, the Coliseum and Roman Forums. The Vatican was also just a short taxi ride away. We booked a junior suite and a double room because we were a party of five. I stayed in the suite and I have to say it was beautiful room, it had a good sized bathroom with complimentary slippers and bath robes. The suite was pretty big with high ceilings and wooden floors. Air conditioning was excellent. The only complaint I have about this hotel is that we were put in the wrong type room on our first night. We booked one junior suite and requested a courtyard view and ended up in a deluxe twin. I approached the front desk right away, but was told they were fully booked and we had to wait until the next morning to move to a suite with a courtyard view as I requested in advance. The next morning, they gave us a keycard for the room we were suppose to be moving to and we were glad we checked it out because they were giving us a suite, but it was right next to an alley and not the courtyard. After speaking to the manager, we were finally granted a junior suite with a courtyard view, but by this time, I was pretty upset already and so it seemed the front desk people were as well. This was a bit disappointing considering I had e-mailed the hotel way in advance to confirm our reservation and our special request to have a room with a courtyard view. The manager replied to my email and confirmed that my request would be taken cared of. I couldn't believe that despite doing this, they still made an error upon our arrival. Even after admitting to their mistake, the hotel didn't offer us any compensation or a proper apology at all. I would recommend this hotel because of it's general appearance, nice & comfortable rooms and it's location.

You do need to taxi to Vatican, and I'd get a price before every taxi ride because there were some very dishonest cab drivers, though most were honest. One cab quoted us 18 euro from the Coliseum (we were exhausted after a long day of site seeing) and when we thought that was high, we found another one who did it for 8 euros.

To come to a conclusion I would recommend the Hotel Delle Nazioni without a doubt, its worth paying the little extra for if you are wanting a 4* hotel & many people tell horror tales of Rome being expensive but all I can say is shop around & look for the best value before commiting yourself. I found many good value restaurants hidden away & the Trastevere part of Rome is well worth the visit for a good value night out with excellent food.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Willmar MN", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in a great location with very unfriendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Greg605", "ReviewID": "UR107418196", "Content": "This hotel is in a wonderful location by the Fontana di Trevi, the rooms were spacious and comfortable, sadly the staff was extremely unfriendly to the point that I'm not sure I would ever stay here again.

When I made my decision and booked with delle Nazioni I emailed for confirmation and received a response within just a few hours! We arrived quite a few hours before check in, however they were able to safely store our belongings and we headed the few steps over to the Trevi Fountain. If the Fountain were just a bit closer you would be able to hear it from the Hotel. It is VERY close by. With it's central location and proximity to the fountain I was expecting a bit more noise. The windows had 3 sets of wooden shutters and room darkening curtains. Once the shutters were closed a majority of the outside noise was blocked. Our room had two single beds (I was traveling with my mother) - but was quite large and comfortable enough for a 9 night stay. We had a large walk in closet with a coded safe and plenty of drawer space. The bathroom was huge! Full size tube with shower curtain and hand held shower sprayer. Water temperature was consistent and pressure was great! We even had a double vanity which really cut down on the time it takes two women to get ready in the morning! The room was kept spotless by housekeeping staff! The front desk staff was very friendly and responsive to needs and although I tried to learn a few phrases of Italian, I was fortunate they all spoke English! The breakfast buffet was well stocked; meats, cheeses, cereal, rolls, croissants (yummy), eggs and bacon. You can definitely fill up and save money by skipping lunch. The buffet was available until 10:30, so there was mad rush and always available seats. I LOVED this place! Oh, I almost forgot, we had a bottle of chilled champagne in our room when we arrived! I will definitely be recommending this hotel!", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cAn ideal Rome hotel\u201d", "Author": "MLBorish", "ReviewID": "UR81077762", "Content": "Certainly not the cheapest but a great location, very satisfactory rooms, fine breakfast, useful assistance from the staff.

After an early flight and a taxi ride of 40minutes we couldn't wait for our room. When we got there, we actually arrived earlier than check in. The gentleman on reception was very welcoming, informed us that there was locker storage to hold our bags, but after checking with housekeeping found our room to be ready. We stayed on the 4th floor- the hotel had lifts, which is rare in some Italian hotels, and were of able size for guests and their luggage. Our room itself, was lovely, over looked a court yard, so kept to noise of the road to a minimum, comfortable beds, large wardrobe, and TV we also had air con, - not really necessary for our room as the sun didn\u2019t hit our room directly, but it was nice to keep it cool. The bathroom was spacious, but the shower was small. I'm a size 10/12 and knocked my arms on the walls several time whilst trying to wash my hair. Toiletries were provided. Our room was cleaned every day with fresh towels We would get up at about 7am (an early start is a must in Rome if you wish to miss the crowds of tourists at some sites) for breakfast. A selection of cereals, bread, spreads, fruits, cheese and ham, were available along with eggs and bacon, tea, coffee and juice. It a help yourself service so take what you wish, there are young girls waiting you if you need any assistance. The reception staffs were helpful, we needed direction one day and they gladly showed us the way on a map. Now the location! My gosh you couldn't ask for a better located hotel. It is literally 60sec walk to the Trevi Fountain. Turn left out of the hotel up Via poli 5min walk and you\u2019re at the Spanish steps. 15 min walk to the Colosseum and about 30/40min to the Vatican. We caught the Metro at Bernini (10min walk) to the Vatican, as we knew that day was going to be a lot of walking, but then walked back. After 3hours + round the Vatican then on to the Castle, then walking back to the hotel was hard going. So you may want to re think walking. Piazza Nova and the Pantheon again 5walk down Via Del Corso- then there are signs telling you the way. All around the hotel are shops, market stalls, cafes, and restaurants.

Deciding is hard because there are so many hotels in Rome and so many reviews. We were very happy with our choice. I had some concerns about reservation, service, etc. after reading so many reviews about so many hotels. This hotel has very good reviews. The price is of course quite high but well worth it. We booked the hotel through Expedia and had no issues getting our room. This hotel is very centrally located and for a short trip, it is essential to be in a central location, one minute walk to Trevi fountain, quiet location for sleep, close to Spanish steps, Via Del Corso for shopping, and close to all other major attractions. Staff was attentive, friendly, and polite. We wanted a late checkout and despite being so busy, they accommodated it. They charged 100 Euros for it but we expected that. They arranged for an airport transfer back from Rome for 50 Euros (in a Mercedes car) which is a very good price. The bellman made sure to get our suitcases from and to hotel. The hotel is very clean and neat. Our room was clean and had no issues at all. Nice marble bathroom (although I am not a big fan of the shower door which covered half of the bathtub not all of it and water would splash a bit but nothing major). The room was cleaned very well every day. They would put new shampoo and soap every day whether you use the old one or not (nowadays north American hotels don't put an extra shampoo if you don't use the previous one). The furniture was very nice and with a good design and good wood, all nicely stained as new. The bed was comfortable. There was a mini bar, TV, and nice large closet in the room. Most importantly there is a personal safe in the closet for your valuables. Internet is not free. 5 Euro for 1 hour of use. Wired internet in room and wireless in the lobby (So take your Ethernet cable). The area is quite despite being close to Trevi Fountain. It is just far enough to not hear anything of the noise of the water or the tourists. (You can't help if people in or around the hotel are noisy sometimes, can happen anywhere.) There is a grocery store just down the street towards Trevi (it looks small) where you can buy cheap bottled water (70c Euro each bottle), I think it is called Express. There is a currency exchange store just down the street towards Trevi, and there is also a bank right in front with a Cash machine. There is a Taxi stand right at the intersection which makes it very convenient to go anywhere and back. The hotel has a restaurant connected to it and part of it which is not bad either. There is a short walk to any of the attractions or shopping in various directions. For Vatican and Collessium I recommend a Taxi. The hotel has a breakfast room that serves breakfast from 7:30 to 10:00AM daily. The buffet breakfast is very good and includes eggs, cold cut meats, cheeses, butter, jam, fruit, milk, tea, various types of coffee, various breads, oatmeal and cereal, and honey (that's what I remember anyway). All in all, everything was nice and pleasant. We had a great stay. The price is not low but comparing it with other hotels in Rome and their options, it is an excellent value. I think it is the best value for the money of an average budget. I definitely recommend it.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ottawa", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel but not if you want to sleep in past 5:00 a.m.\u201d", "Author": "Ottawa1421", "ReviewID": "UR78667226", "Content": "Ok, I\u2019m not a complainer and I do consider myself well travelled but I did have some issues with this hotel. First you arrive and the person at the front desk hands you a document and tells you to sign it. There is no information to speak of on the document but he tells you that you have to sign and that he\u2019ll fill out the information later. Now I\u2019m not a lawyer but my \u201cspidey\u201d senses were tingling. I wouldn\u2019t sign it nor do I know of anyone who would sign it unless you\u2019re tired and just arrived from a long trip and just want to head to the room. Anyway we had a junior suite and the girls had a double room. Both rooms were absolutely beautiful and we immediately unpacked for the last 3 days of our 2 week stay in Europe. After walking around for a while, we headed back to bed but were woken up at around 5:00 a.m. by the sounds of the deliveries (we were in room 215) and men talking just below the window. After some time the noise subsided and just before I fell asleep again, the recycled bottles were picked up. I\u2019m sure by now you can appreciate how noisy it was even though both sets of shutters and the windows were closed. Before breakfast I asked for another room so that I could at least sleep in the next day. Breakfast was very good with an excellent selection. Everything is self-serve so the service was excellent (lol). Anticipating that they would give us a room in a more quite area, we vacated the room of all our belongings but when we returned at 7:00 pm, nothing was done. We called the front desk and were told that we were unreasonable to request another room at 7:00 in the evening since there were no maids to make up the room (by now I was getting really irritated). They did manage to get us a replacement room for the 3rd night but because we had to leave at 4:00 a.m. it didn\u2019t make sense to change after all, I would for once, sleep in without hearing the constant noise (noise starts at 5:00 a.m.). Getting a taxi to the airport was quite frustrating. Fixed fee is 50 Euros but the front desk said that because you leave at 4:00 in the morning, it\u2019s going to cost 65 Euros. Then Marco (the desk clerk) said that we needed a mini van since we were 4 people and had a combined 4 pieces of luggage between us. The price was now 75 Euros and we said sure why not but, when we returned the evening before our departure and requested confirmation that the taxi was indeed reserved for 4:00 a.m., we were told that the cost was now 100 Euros. Ever feel like you\u2019re spinning in a vortex? At any time we might have been informed that should the moons and the stars not be properly aligned it might cost us more. Anyway, after some back and forth, we reserved a Mercedes taxi for 75 Euros and there was more than enough room for all of us and the luggage. Pros: Great location, beautiful rooms, decent breakfast Cons: Don\u2019t take a room located on the side of hotel, no follow up from hotel staff, conflicting information from various hotel staff.

Third, my room was pretty small, which I understand when I get a single, and it had a terrace as large as the room. Unfortunately no effort was made to make the terrace attractive, it had one beat-up table and two chairs. Also, while the bathroom was good sized the shower was small, I think a large man (or woman for that matter) would be uncomrtable in it.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eugene, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cgreat value and location\u201d", "Author": "thesmiledoc", "ReviewID": "UR69517048", "Content": "Surprising great location!

The location really triumphed everything else \u2013 we were able to walk to all the big sites in Rome and were able to come back during the day to freshen up if we wanted to! Everything was ~20 min walk in any direction from the hotel. We were also able to visit Trevi Fountain (1 minute walk!) early in the morning before the crowds of people arrived. The great thing about the hotel is that it was really close to Trevi (easy to find!) but on a side street so was quiet at night and even during the day! The rooms were outdated and the bathroom had an odd configuration. There was also a leak from the ceiling of the bathroom and the paint was chipping away. We were in a junior suite so had a corner room with windows facing [ ]. Our room was rather spacious with a separate sitting area. The room was nice and bright during the day, but at night was very dark as there were not enough lights in the room. The bed was hard and pillows flat but we were tired enough it didn\u2019t matter much. There was both a shower and a bathtub with shower head and 2 sinks. Water pressure was good although the shower head was oddly positioned and splashed everywhere. As others have mentioned, they did include linens as handtowels and did not have face towels. Bath towels were cotton but really light (or worn) material. The hotel and rooms were non-smoking although we did find an ashtray in our room \u2013 thankfully no smell of smoke during our stay. We did wake up to some loud noises from the floor above us at 6am (sounded like furniture being dragged around) which was unpleasant. It is a busy hotel and was fully booked when we arrived. Front desk is hit or miss \u2013 the older gentlemen seemed to be more helpful than the younger staff. Everyone spoke English which was helpful as our Italian was unfortunantly non existant. We had almost gotten ripped off by a taxi driver coming in from the airport (btw it\u2019s a fixed cost of 40 euros + 1 euro per piece of luggage \u2013 don\u2019t let them convince you otherwise there\u2019s a big sign in the airport and a sign on each cab!). When we asked the hotel staff, he was understanding of the taxi driver trying to over charge us and explained that anything under 60 euros was a good deal [despite the law that was passed on taxi drivers NOT overcharging)!!! Another hotel guest had gotten ripped off coming from Termini station (should be 15 euros). Breakfast was nothing to brag about although it was included in the room charge. Surprisingly, there were not many places to eat breakfast so the included breakfast was convenient although not tasty. There is a supermarket across the street (ask for Despar and not the convenient store next door as it is much cheaper at the supermarket) which we frequented quite often. We did find out that the hotel has a separate car service to the airport for only 50 euros \u2013 the driver was polite and on-time and efficiently got us to the airport in a roomy black Mercedes. You do have to remind the front desk on booking the car service though because the first guy we told forgot to actually reserve the car. All in all, loved the location which made the stay pleasant and memorable.

The room was very clean, with nice hardwood floors, flat screen tv, mini-bar, safe, very comfortable bed and pillows, wooden shutters which kept out the street noise. The shower is very small. I read in one of the reviews that there would not be an iron in the room, so I took a travel iron. They do offer laundry services. Also, they do not provide hair conditioner, so bring your own.

This hotel is situated literally 1 minute walk away from Trevi Fountain. It is an amazing location. You can walk anywhere really from it but we used the Metro line a lot of the time as it is the cheapest way to get around. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted straight away by concierge and checked in immediately. We were given a great room on the 5th floor with a lovely terrace over looking the street that runs up to the Trevi Fountain. The room was very clean and a good size for European hotels and the terrace defintely made the difference. There is a mini bar stocked with lots of different drinks if you fancy one. The only one thing that I would say that the room lacked was the lack of information for sights and tourist information. But you could get this information downstairs. Apart from that the room was great. The Breakfast is a buffet style with a huge variety of food to choose from. It goes on to 10.30 which gives you good time if you fancy a lie in. The staff in the hotel are qute friendly and there English is good. But in particular I want to mention the guy from concierge (can remember name). He could not have been more helpful at all times. We needed a cable to charge our camera and I asked at reception if there was a shop to buy one and the concierge guy told me that he had one in his car and he give us it to use for the whole trip. I was very impressed by this as it saved us buying a cable that would not work over here in UK. All in all I can only say pretty positive things about this hotel but one thing that did suprise me was the fact that there are no irons in the rooms and to iron clothes you have to pay for housekeeping to do it and it cannot be done in the evenings. I am not sure if this is the norm for european hotels but I would have all clothes ironed before you go. If I was going back to Rome I would defintely stay in this hotel again as it is a reasonable price, good service, very clean and a good breakfast to start the day.", "Date": "November 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent,UK", "Title": "\u201cNot sure would stay here next time!\u201d", "Author": "nikeexplore", "ReviewID": "UR47687445", "Content": "Certainly brilliant location and clean, fairly comfortable hotel but quite basic really for over \u00a3200 a night(inclusive of breakfast and taxes).

The hotel is beautiful it is on a lovely quiet side street that leads down to the Trevi Fountain, literally not even a two minute walk. The gentlemen on reception were very helpful. We stayed in room 318 and it was perfect. The bed was huge, the room, the bedding and the bathroom was spotless. The shower was great, there were two sinks which came in handy when we were both trying to get ready at the same time and also a bidet.

Everything we wanted to see while were there was in close proximity, we walked everywhere except to the Vatican where we got a taxi which cost 8 euros. Always haggle taxis because even though it only costs us 8 euros to get to the Vatican we asked a driver when we were ready to leave how much and he said 18 euros so we said no chance and asked another taxi driver and he charged 10 euros. Just a last note to say that we went at the time we did for a specific occasion and after we\u2019d booked we found out that the 15th August is a bank holiday but there is no need to let that put you off because as far as we could see everything was open, that we needed anyway.

We asked for and received a room facing the courtyard that was relatively quiet. The hotel first offered to upgrade us to a suite on the roof, which is big and has spectacular views. Unfortunately, the room was not non-smoking so it reeked. We asked for a non-smoking room and ended up with what we paid for - a non-smoking small room facing the courtyard. The service staff made up our room daily. The sheets and bathroom were clean. The shower was particularly small - smaller than any other showers we've experienced in Europe. We spent very little time at our hotel in Rome since we were there to see the sights, so for sleeping, cleaning and breakfast purposes, this hotel works. The morning breakfast is plentiful and not bad. Nothing fancy and certainly not four star, but it has variety and fresh food that satisfied. The hotel is fairly large, so expect to see a lot of tourists around. Not recommended for anyone that expects their hotel to enhance a romantic getaway. There was always at least one person at the front desk and they all spoke English well and were helpful. Laundry here is very expensive - in fact, laundry everywhere in Rome is expensive, so your money is better spent on buying extra or new clothing. Although our room was non-smoking and indeed did not smell, the rest of the hotel had a strong smoke odor - not surprising since most of the tourists we encountered were European or Asian (few Americans). For the price, you could probably do better than Nazioni, but you could certainly do worse. We left with no major complaints and no lasting memories of Nazioni - pretty much what we expected and all we could ask for.", "Date": "January 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNot that great ....\u201d", "Author": "Life_in_the_city", "ReviewID": "UR22263044", "Content": "Stayed 3 nights at the Hotel delle Nazioni.

We stayed at this hotel for 8 days / 7 nights and our room was located on the 3rd floor. I would have given this a 5 but we had several issues. Let me start off with the good news. The hotel is literally near the Trevi Fountain... about a 30 second walk. You cannot hear all the noise from the crowds which is great. This is pretty much walking distance from all the site seeing monuments except for The Vatican (which we took the Metro). The hotel was up to date and sort of trendy. The concierge, registration, and bellmen were very nice and helpful. The rooms were always clean and tidy. The A/C worked but we kept it off since it was cooler at nights and we always kept the drapes closed. We only used the free continental breakfast twice. The eggs and bacon reminded me of a Las Vegas hotel buffet. Don't know if you want to count that as good or bad. Now for the bad news. We had 2 issues: the noise in the morning and our \"mysterious\" disappearing clothes. In the morning around 9am, you can hear housekeeping moving the furniture around everyday like clock-work. It's the same noise you hear when you move a wooden chair across a wooden floor with the vibration. Well, that kept us up since we were still jet-lagged. The second issue was on our 7th day there. We got back from shopping near the Spanish Steps and realized that ALL of our personal stuff on the desk has been rearranged. Not a big deal but after 6 days of not moving our personal items around, this day was different. My Timothy Ferris book was now on the nightstand table instead of the main desk (remember it hasn't moved in 6 days from the desk). Our dirty clothes were moved around (we had stacked them in piles) and my wife's shoes / slippers were rearranged... except for her Nike shoes (the ones that has 4 springs on the heel). We literally found them behind the drapes we never opened. Her Nike's were originally with all her shoes and slippers. That was not all... When we got back to LA on Wednesday, we wanted to separate the clothes for laundry and noticed that her Banana Republic skirt was missing. We always make it a habit to comb through the room when we leave any hotel room and we obviously combed through this room since we do live 6000+ miles away. We called the hotel (an international call, no 800#) at 12pm PST Thurs (which was 9pm Thurs in Rome) to let them know that we \"left a skirt in our room\" and they said to call back tomorrow morning. I called back at 11pm PST (which was 8am Friday) and the receptionist said he will find out with housekeeping and to call back in 30 minutes. My 3rd call back just told me that housekeeping found \"nothing\". This hotel is managed by ReMar Hotel and I tried to file a complaint but nothing was on their website except for the hotel's information. That won't do anything for us. All in all, the hotel deserved a 5 for its location, 4 for their concierge, registration, and bellmen, and a 0 for their housekeeping. We're just glad that all of our valuables were put in our in-room safe and nothing else was taken. For being a 4 star hotel, I would have thought this kind of thing wouldn't happen.", "Date": "September 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant Hotel With Excellent Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "Fussy08", "ReviewID": "UR20053329", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Delle Nazioni between 4-10th August. We had a great week at this hotel. We could not have picked a better hotel. The location is brilliant everything is in walking distance. Everything of interest is not more than a 20 minute leisurely walk and i mean leisurely. The trevi fountain is at the end of the street, about 50 steps. Everyone says that Rome is quiet during the summer because all the Romans disappear and let me tell you this had me worried at the beginning of my holiday. Sure a lot of the little tobacco shops were closed but we didnt even notice. Tourist shops are aplenty, restaurants were all open and all the sights were open. Tours of the city and Italy still run every day. The Manager of the hotel, was kind enough and booked all of our tours through Green Line Tours and everything went off without a hitch. The bus for the tours was always on time and the lovely staff even brought us a breakfast bag each before our long 3hr coach journey to Florence. The breakfast were excellent nearly everything you can imagine, Cheese, hams, eggs, bacon, croissants, cereals, fruit, toast etc. The room itself was perfect for us, however there was no iron which we would have liked. We cannot thank Hotel Delle Nazioni enough for our stay.

It is perfectly located for a visit to Rome, being within easy walking distance of many of the main visitor atttractions, and with easy access to transport links to further away sights. The Trevi fountain is literally 1 minute walk away, the Spanish steps, the Pantheon and the Piazza Venetia only 5 minutes walk away. There is a supermarket directly across the street, and another about 100 mtrs away. There is an ATM next door and another straight across the road. The hotel is very quiet, it has a bar and restaurant attached but they weren't very busy while I was there. I did eat in the restaurant one evening and was very satisfied with the food and the service. Breakfast was continental buffet-style, with scrambled eggs and bacon available. Very satisfying. The hotel also provide breakfast boxes to take away if you are taking a day-trip with an early mornign start - you just need to arrange it with reception. My room was very comfortable, although it was quite small. The bathroom had a shower cubicle, but no bath. There was hot water available all day long. The bed linen and towels were changed every day. The reception staff all spoke good English and were very pleasant and helpful. My one complaint is that my room overlooked a side street and there were lorries and vans and workmen making a racket every morning from before 7:00am. They were working on renovation of a building further on down the street so they aren't a permanent fixture. It wasn't a big deal really as, to get the most out of a visit to Rome, you need to be up and out early anyway.
