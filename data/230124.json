The tram and bus stop is literally in front of the hotel (Swindenstraat\u00e2\u20ac\u017d stop). The area is nice and quiet with restaurants, cafe's, grocery store, and a couple bars across the street. An outdoor market and a couple of American fast-food joints are also nearby. Next to hotel is a park/pond on one side and the Tropen museum on the other. From the outside, the hotel looks like a modern design from the early 80's, outdated and unappealing. There is a gate outside and a keycard required for elevators so it seemed secure, even though the neighborhood appeared safe. The lobby is nothing special, but the front desk staff were very friendly, spoke English well, always greeted us, and were helpful when asked questions. They do have SMOKING ROOMS available upon request, and the windows open so it doesn't get too smoky. There is wireless internet access in the rooms but a daily charge of around 10euros required( 30 minutes free in lobby upon request). We actually stayed in two different smoking rooms during our 5 day stay here. Both rooms were quiet, clean, had hairdryer, laptop sized safe, and an instant coffee maker. The first room was smaller, just enough room for two twin beds pushed together and a desk. It wasn't uncomfortable but I wouldn't call it spacious. The shower, closet, and sink was separate from the toilet. There were two problems with this room, first the television didn't work, but more importantly the beds were on wheels which didn't lock in place properly so the bed kept separating. Called front desk, they sent someone to fix within 15 minutes, could not so we switched rooms the following morning. The second room was larger, and the bathroom was \"normal\". No bathtub but the shower had hot water and good pressure. The beds firm and comfortable. Plenty of closet space. Had a view of the museum which was pleasant to look at. Overall a good room for a fair price. The hotel has a restaurant and bar(didn't use), has a secure baggage storeroom with luggage scale, and restrooms in the lobby. NH hotels are generally known for good service, and Tropen lived up to the reputation. Other than the couple of issues with the first room, the rest of the stay was good. I would probably return here again and recommend it to couples who visit Amsterdam but do not want to be in the middle of the action.

The hotel reception staff were very, very helpful and friendly. They arranged the 2 mini buses back to airport without any fuss. The buses cost 65 euro for 6 people, so saved a lot of time going back into the city. All 12 of us would go back, no problem at all. Behind the hotel is the park, but more importantly.....across the road directly from the hotel was the local high street with a few good bars selling decent beer from smaller breweries etc. We quite liked the Spar90 bar which served Hertrog Jan beer. Just 10 minutes walk from the hotel is the Brouwerij't IJ brewery pub on Funenkade 7. Turn left out of the hotel towards the canal then turn right. Look for the large windmill and the pub is beneath it. Tours at various times are available, but the pub shuts around 2000hrs most nights, so get there earlier. If you are in a group and looking for things to do, try booking the beer bike tour of the city. I will say no more, just search the world wide web thingy. Hope this review helps. Enjoy.

The rooms were small and bathroom was quite a squeeze but overall the room was very comfortable, clean and nice. We managed to get a room with a view of the museum and it was lovely. The hotel is not very central but tram service is just at the door and main attractions are very easily accessible via public transport which is available 24/7 (bear in mind that public transport is extremely efficient here). It takes about 20 minutes to get to the central area and I would suggest that you get a day ticket or week ticket, depending on your length of stay, as it is more economical and allows you to travel all around Amsterdam. Breakfast at NH Tropen was simple and is nothing lavish but quality of food and drinks were quite good. Although the breakfast service team weren't really bothered about service, the front desk staff were generally polite and friendly. Being further away from the city center, this hotel is in a very peaceful location, ideal for those who are looking for a place to have a good rest and a good nights sleep. You will definitely be away from the hustle and bustle of the Amsterdam night life but still within close reach. Convenience stores are available nearby. Although the bed was comfortable and I slept well generally, there were some downsides to the hotel - I could hear the wind howling when it was windy and at about 5am there was repeated clanking noises (probably from the heating system when it is turned on) which was very annoying. Check-in and check-out was very efficient but wi-fi was only available in the lobby for a limited time which was quite inconvenient. I would highly recommend this hotel for those who are more adventurous and do not mind using public transport to get around.

Room was cleaned every day but the maid often forgot to do something or other like replace towels, tissues, note paper or coffee sachets, clean the cups etc. We tried the breakfast buffet one morning which offered a great range of food, all very tasty and fresh, but slightly overpriced at 18\u00e2\u201a\u00ac (15 if booked in advance).

We got our money eventually back only a week after we left. The room was very dusty (housekeeping does only floors) and once we even ended up with 7 dirty coffee mugs after the housekeeping.

If you look at a map of Amsterdam the hotel is right next to the Tropen Museum. However, it's a 15-20 minute tram ride to get to the City Center. This was too far from the center of Amsterdam activity to me and most tourists I think. I purchased my room from another website rather than directly through NH Hotels website. Several amenities were listed that just didn't exist. There was no breakfast included...even though I paid $168 a night. Breakfast was an additional 18 Euros. I was told because of booking through another website that I was not entitled to breakfast even if I had paid more than many guests who booked directly though the hotel's website. There was also no free newspaper because of this as well. Internet was an additional 10.70 Euros for 24 hours. All of the stores and restaurants in the hotel area close very early - by 6-8pm so if you stay here make sure you eat while you are in the City Center or get food to bring back to the hotel. The hotel restaurant is only open for breakfast and 3 hours during the evening. It was also listed that this hotel had Tempurapedic Foam mattresses. This is untrue. The mattresses were so hard that it was impossible to sleep on your back. With as much walking around as Amsterdam requires it is nice to come back to a comfortable bed. Honestly I think a thin mattress in a cheap Hostel would be much more comfortable. The room itself was modernly appointed, however the toilet is literally in a former closet, and the sink in the toilet closet is smaller than an airplane bathroom sink. The shower and another sink are in another room. There is also a closet in the shower room that also contains a safe that will fit most laptop computers and other valuables. The housekeeping is apparently paid by how many rooms they do. I put out the 'do not disturb' sign to avoid servicing of my room. I was gone several hours and when I returned the sign was turned around to the other side, saying \"Please clean my room\". The housekeeping lady rushed to my room and told me to please put the \"do not disturb\" sign inside my door, or she would not get paid for cleaning that room, even though she didn't clean my room. The next day I didn't put out the sign and when I returned, there was a half used bar of soap dropped on the floor and left there, and apparently the housekeeper had decided to use my toilet and there was a large wad of toilet paper in the toilet waiting to be flushed.

I would stay here again. The bed was comfortable and they have a pillow program where you can select from an assortment of pillows (down, neck pillow, etc.) for premium sleep. I love the fact that there is no carpet in the room - dark laminate floors, which I find more sanitary. There is a great selection of TV stations for different languages if one is stuck in the room. We had a view over the park and it was very quiet. I doubt that this hotel has air conditioning, but it was in the 60s in June, so they didn't need it when we were there. We did have breakfast which had a selection of warm and cold items that included boiled and scrambled eggs, breads, deli meat, cheese, fruit, cereal, pastries, coffee, juice, etc.. Impressed overall. Since we were with a conference, we had a special rate with breakfast. If you choose to eat breakfast there, try to get the price in writing because we were quoted 3 different prices when asking 3 different people - one said 15, another 18 and we ended up paying 19 Euros- this last aspect is actually a strong negative. Also note that the higher up you stay, the more you pay - they don't tell you this when they assign you a room (we did not request the 8th floor), but again we had a special conference rate. I would stay here again and I would go without the breakfast - a roll at a bakery for 1 Euro is good enough for me. Very comfortable, quiet with great service.

However, I was quite disappointed when I arrived. The reception staff was friendly enough and check-in was easy. It did occur to me, that it did not look rather worn when entering, and this was only to be confirmed. The room was quite small (and judging from the emergency exit chart on the door, they all were on my floor), and it was rather gloomy due to the heavy use of brown colours and not much lighting. It was also very cold, and it took me some time to find out that there was a hole underneight the TV set where I could reach into a thermostat and turn on some heating. A colleague staying in another room also met a very cold room. The heating was effecient but such a cold room is just not very welcoming. My room had twin beds which were not large but rather comfortable. Unlike most other hotel chains, NH actually offers a \"pillow menu\", giving you a choice of a number of different types of pillows. That is a nice feature, but even the standard ones were fine. The room had seperate WC and bathrooms, both very small. As a male, you would almost have to make up your mind on your use of the WC before entering to ensure that you entered the room the right way round. There did not appear to be any heating in the WC, so there was no hanging around there reading the newspaper. Bathroom was also rather small with a tiny shower niche. Not much water pressure in the shower, and the fittings were generally rather worn, but otherwise it was OK. Apart from all the regular items found in hotel bathrooms, they also had extras like a sponge, dental kit, and a comb. For regular visitors they even offered to keep your gels and liquids (like shaving gel) so that you would not have to worry about that at the airport if you were a hand baggage only traveller. That is actually quite a good idea, if you have the need. One rather weird thing was that the cupboard was located inside the bathroom. The TV set offered a selection of Dutch TV channels plus a few international ones, including BBC 1 & 2, but not a major news channel like BBC World, Sky News, or CNN. But in fact, rather than watching TV, you might simply want to enjoy the view. I was on the 9th floor, and the view from there was fantastic. Surprisingly, even on the 9th floor there was quite a lot of traffic noise from down below. Some of this noise would come from the trams, with tram line 9 operating just outside the hotel, taking you straight into the centre of Amsterdam, including to the central station and Rembrandtplein. Connexion shuttle buses are operated to and from the airport, so if you are travelling by public transport, the place is conveniently located. Parking is available, though at an extra price, and they only have a few spaces. Finally, I would say that I was quite disappointed that everything was extra and at a high cost. With rather limited parking, a charge for this is fair enough, but \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17 for an incredibly dull breakfast is a rip-off.

We explained that we had walked in on Sunday and didn't have an advance reservation. At 11pm we were handed our bags which had been packed by the hotel staff. The young woman at the desk was obviously annoyed that \"her manager\" had placed her in such a difficult position but she never offered to help us find another hotel.

I was working for a company who made all the hotel arrangements, so I have no idea what the room cost or even what level room I had, but I think I was in a standard room which was on the 7th floor. This hotel was a very mixed bag for me. They get the big things right, but the small things are terribly wrong. The hotel is located a bit off the street and can be a bit hard to find the first time, but it is directly behind the tram stop on the right side of the street if you're leaving the city center. After entering the hotel property through a very strange gate in a fence with barbed wire on top you enter into a very calming courtyard and then into the lobby which is fairly attractively decorated in a modern fashion. The bar/restaurant is at the back overlooking Oosterpark, the breakfast room to one side (also with windows on the park) and the front desk is located right across for the lifts, allowing the staff to keep an eye on things. Security was OK (despite the strange balcony mentioned in previous reviews) and you need your room key to get into the lifts. Checkin was very easy as I was all prebooked and they just handed me my keycard. I don't know what other experiences would be. The room was indeed small, but fairly nicely laid out with an adequate bed that was very firm, two side tables, a desk with chair, one additional side chair, and a nice wardrobe. The bath was small and with only a shower, but was adequate. One problem was that the towels were not replenished in any regular fashion and the number and size of towels varied from day to day. The ammenties were never replenished and the very small glycerine soaps melted away in about a minute. Other problems. My wakeup call never came, although by that time I had discovered that the TV had an easy to use alarm which sufficed. I reported that my door was broken and that I had to slam it to get it closed. It was never repaired, despite a promise to do so. The elevator lobby on my floor had two ceramic vases on a table, one of which was broken. Other minor problems were also present, but nothing extraordinary. They just all combined to give me the impression of a hotel that wasn't trying very hard. Breakfast was OK, but I wasn't paying as it was included with my room. The usual coffee, meats, cheeses, cereal, fruit, etc. but also cooked eggs sausage and bacon. I was worried about the location, but it was actually fine. The number 9 tram does stop right outside and runs frequently throughout the daytime but stops at about midnight. I actually walked into the city center several times, a very safe 30 minute walk, and easy to do. I actually walked back at 2:00 am one morning and I had no problems whatsoever as there were several other people out on the street as well. The area is a bit sketchy but OK. There is a weekend street market down the street and a few shops that aren't terribly interesting. Several restaurants and bars are close by and there is also a coffee shop if that sort of thing interests you. The park is nice for a morning walk or run but does get odd at night. If you stray too far you will very possibly find yourself in an immigrant area which seemed safe but not the normal Amsterdam. All in all, a decent stay but there are certainly better choices closer to the middle of town. It would be fairly easy to get to if you are driving, since it is located right on a main road that connects directly to the ring road and you don't need to drive anywhere near the center of town.", "Date": "October 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portugal", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, but...\u201d", "Author": "Terrazul", "ReviewID": "UR5592611", "Content": "Stayed at NH Tropen for four nights in June.

Also, there is one only balcony surrounding all the building in every stage, which makes an easy access from a room to another if anyone would want to, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even risk sleeping with the window open.

So it was a bit difficult to get a good night sleep, what was a real shame in a comfortable room and bed. The staff was great, always answering our questions about the city and giving us directions. The hotel is a little bit off the centre but the tram stops right in front of it, so it turns out to be easy to reach the main sites. The only problem with this location is that the last tram runs at about midnight ( hey Amsterdam ! get more night friendly ! ) so if you want to stay downtown a little longer you have to catch a taxi to get back to the hotel.

It is located by Oosterpark, which is beautiful with a pond and ducks. We had a few very relaxing picnic lunches there. However, do not go to this park at night as the contingent changes drastically from regular people enjoying nature to young punks giving you dirty looks. The metro in Amsterdam is almost useless and you need to take the tram or bus (bus especially at night) to get anywhere if you are not centrally located. But in 2 days, we learned how to walk there and back and our last night we had no problems with taking a 2-hour walk around 3am back to the hotel from the center. The rooms are tiny and we had a double. The views of the park and city are cool, but seriously - the rooms are very cramped. The food is crazy overpriced - 13 euros for breakfast? I don't think so. But the service is excellent. The front desk is very courteous and attentive. By the way a cab to Schipol airport from here is 45 euros and takes around 20 minutes. We were almost late for our morning flight on the last night (fell asleep) but they checked us out very quickly and called the cab which was there in 5 minutes. We paid around $120 per night for this room. The only comparably-priced hotels near the center are dumps in or around the Red Light District which I wouldn't stay at ever. It sounds nice whehn you're booking but you are very dissapointed when you get there. We are all in our early 20's but none would stay there. This is a good compromise if you are fine with walking.
