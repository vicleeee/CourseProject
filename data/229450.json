On the positive side, rooms have great beds and are immaculate with opulent linen, quality bathrooms with excellent amenities and finally the breakfast is excellent with some welcome differences to normal hotel choices, for example strawberry juice! Staff were uniformly efficient, helpful and very friendly. WiFi is complementary, which was welcome too. On the negative side, the rooms are small, but that's true for pretty much all Paris hotels (an unwelcome feature which makes stays awkward, and value seem poor). The TV and pay TV were a pretty old system and CNN and BBC World were intermittent. Paris hotels often have idiosynctratic quirks to their service, and on this stay I had a totally over persistent staff member knocking five times on my door at just before 10pm and then trying to let themselves in just to collect my room service tray!

The rooms are typically small as are most hotels in Paris, however, it was bigger than most of this star rating I have stayed at in Paris. The decor through out has a very artistic feel about it and the design touches throughout make it feel like a boutique hotel. Facilities in the room are as standard per most hotels of this nature and there was very little external noise to keep you awake, which can be a problem in parts of most major cities. I also dined at the hotel, which offered a very good menu of typical well executed parisien cuisine. Service was good if a little slow at times, but then lingering over a good meal and a bottle of wine should not be complained about.

I am an Accor Platinum member thanks to my work trips and am meant to be a VIP (not being elitist, but would hate to think how they treat others if I am meant to be special!)

Inside the foyer is done nicey, due to the upscale restaurant in the back (pricey so didn't bother). The bar is nice but service is very slow....just put another barperson on! Spent a fortune on an upgrade to a junior suite, as a treat and to make the weekend nice. Had read a review that said these rooms look over the street and very parisian blah blah blah.....small room with a Nespresso (special mention in room description) that didn't even work, and staff wouldn't fix it. The view was off the aircon ducts out the back and the service area. Bed was ok, only 2-3 tv channels in English. I can only assume that this place is only good for someone wanting a good location.

We didn't have any strong odor as others have reported. Sometimes I smelled a slight odor like mold or mildew in the bathroom, but I could see none. It must have come from the drains I guess. We were in 414. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. However, on our last night there, while we were at dinner, one of them stole a large box of expensive chocolates from a famous chocolatier in Dijon that we had placed in the minibar. We reported this and received an apology, but that did not get us the chocolates or our money. Our other complaint is that our room usually didn't get cleaned up until 5:00 p.m. or later. It was at a time when we wanted to clean up before dinner. There was no room for the maid and us in the room at the same time, so we had to go downstairs in the reception area to wait for her to finish.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reston", "Title": "\u201cParis in October\u201d", "Author": "Debra M Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR119107821", "Content": "The Hotel baltimore is nicely located near a subway stops.

I had noticed there was no hairdryer in the room just before we went out but as I didn't intend using it before dinner it was no big deal.

We said we'd have a drink in the bar and come back to reception to pick up the hairdryer. We headed to our room and my husband called down to reception and spoke with the man on duty (Javier), who told my husband he'd already said we would not get it till the morning. My husband went down to reception to see them and find out what the problem was and when he was speaking with girl on duty, the guy was muttering and swearing under his breath. When my husband challenged him on this he got very agressive when my husband asked for his name. He said \"i'm not giving you my fu**ing name and was shouting at my husband. Never in all our years travelling have we received this arrogance, rudness and aggressive attitude from anyone. All we wanted was a hairdryer, which should have been in the room anyway. My husband asked for the manager and this awful man on reception said there were no managers. My husband went to the resaurant and spoke with the manager there who was shocked to hear what had just happened, as were several other guests who were standing around at the time. We got the hairdryer at that point. The following morning my husband spoke with the Manager, who was not aware of the incident and said he would offer something to us in the way of compensation that day.

The second and subsequent days they sent a technician to the room to fix the problem but on each occasion it was the same technician. This person could not speak a word of english and informed management on each occasion that the air conditioning worked perfectly. On the third day he set the thermostat on 30 degrees and we thought that the control must have been working in the opposite direction until we started to swelter. Management then accused us of setting the thermostat on 30 degrees and that it was our fault.. On the forth day we had to physically drag a manager by the name of Michelle to the room to show him the difference in temperature between the hotel hallway outside our door and our room. Finally we got recognition that there was a problem. For our 4 day stay we have to sleep with the windows open to get some relief from the hot room. With the noise from the street sleeping was poor. The management on checking out admitted full liability for our discomfort and offered a lousy 10% off the hotel account.

I found the concierge to be most helpful in getting dinner reservations at Chez Robert & Louise and helping us to track down a power converter after we realized we bought the wrong one in preparation for the trip.

The other 'interesting' feature was that when you emptied the sink all the water flowed UP the bidet, filling it almost to the brim - not very nice when you're trying to get a clean feeling! Another negative, certainly in this room, was the lack of storage space. There was one wardrobe with 8 hangers, not exactly enough for two people to hang their clothes. We thought we'd found some nice drawers to put the rest of our things in, but it turned out to be the fridge with false drawers (decorative). So, we ended up having to leave a lot of our things in the suitcase. There are some nice things though. The room was always clean, with fresh bed linin every day. The evening turn down service was a bonus, and it was nice to come back in after an evening out and feel instantly relaxed.

Even if the reception has been notified before the couple' s arrival by a travel agent that they are in a special vacation and, thus, they desire to be given a special, cozy, room, the couple is given one of the worst rooms in the hotel... The room, in fact, is a single and belonging to an inferior class from what they have booked (and paid!).

The hotel, overall, is a little bit run down and the staff not so much helpful. The breakfast is very poor and the plates are not changed so that at times you have to wait for or, eventually, to skip an assortment or another of food. The rooms, in general, are small and lack personality. The cable reception in rooms is very poor. The showers don't work properly. The only good thing about the rooms is the mattresses, but this is not a particular merit of the hotel, since it is standard in all Sofitel hotels. Now, to get back to my story... Two days after, upon the couple's departure, they have the misfortune to be serviced by the same bored receptionist, Anne, by her name. They pack their bags and call the reception to send somebody to help them with the luggage. They are said \"Sure, right away, sir!\" but nobody is sent. Finally, after half an hour of waiting, they go down to the reception to find out that Anne has not even asked somebody to go and help them. Even more, Anne is very rude to the couple, making a big scene in the reception in front of a puzzled audience.

Internet / business center is down stairs, but only 1 PC so quite busy. In general we had quite a good time in paris. The hotel is quite expensive , but from what i heard unless you want to pay 800 ~ 1000 euro per night, Paris is very expensive so hotel rooms are usually very very small. In general a really good hotel, but for your own safety avoid eating dinner there.", "Date": "October 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel Fabulous location, We loved it !!\u201d", "Author": "Sparktwinkle", "ReviewID": "UR8130172", "Content": "We went here in March and it was a little rainy but it was wonderful. The Hotel is off Klebar(sp*) Which is right near to the Arc de Triumphe The room was a new modern design, and it was fabulous. It was lovely and spacious. It was very clean and it very much exceeded our expectations. We also treated ourself to a night at the Moulan Rouge (which our conceirge arranged and bagged us the very best seats with no extra cost). I recommend the Champers and dinner at the Rouge ( not to be missed .. when in paris lol) The food at this Hotel was excellent - the food is by far the best food that I have ever had the pleasure to experience, This hotel is the perfect place to stay at when in paris. You are 5 min walk from the Eiffel Tower (where you can board the batobus glass boat and visit the lourve and all the other top tourist spots, also very reasonably priced and run all day long) The staff were all wonderful and very helpful. We cannot fault this hotel at all. This for us was 10/10.

We took the upgrade which had more square footage because it was the last leg of our trip and we thought we'd splurge. Plus it gave our toddler more room to spread his toys out. I won't say it was worth the cost (an extra $70 a night) but I'm glad we had a bigger room. The standard room was just about the right size for a city like Paris--I've stayed in smaller hotels in New York. Like any 4+ star hotel, the costs of some services was astounding--for instance, if you want to have your laundry done its 8 euros for ONE shirt! Needless to say we opted another route (a good friend lives in the city so I ended up doing laundry at her place). I was offered an internet service--15 euros for 10 hours which was more than adequate for the 5 days we were there for checking emails and looking for places to go. The staff was excellent---very friendly and spoke very good English. They were always helpful. The bed was the most comfortable in our entire 16 days in Europe--very similar to our own bed at home which to me made the price of the hotel worth it (a little over $300 a night). The location was excellent. It is within walking distance to the Eiffel Tower, Arc d'Triomphe, Champs Elysee, and several metro lines. In fact a metro stop is just across from the hotel. We loved the cafes and restaurants. Every single one we entered was full of locals and the food excellent. My only complaint is that the hotel seems to cater more to businessmen--all the complimentary toiletry were more suited for men. The lobby at the end of the day had business men sitting and smoking. Since I did not hang out in the lobby the smoking didn't really bother me. My husband and I are planning to return (without the toddler) soon and we'll most likely stay here again.", "Date": "May 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cQuality not quantity\u201d", "Author": "MiamiTechnoLawyer", "ReviewID": "UR7292095", "Content": "We stayed at Sofitel Baltimore from March 14 to March 18, 2007. We booked the Hotel on Priceline (bidding on the 4+ star category, with a bid of $210.00 U.S. per night with service fees and taxes it was $225). We had previously stayed at another Sofitel in London. Upon arrival we were offered a choice of two upgrades either from a standard to a superior room for 30 Euros per night or from a standard to a Junior Suite for 100 Euros per night. Apparently the strategy is to convert the Priceline traveller to a higher revenue guest. We were advised the Standard room is really designed for a single traveller but can accomodate two adults. The room was small about 11 x 13 feet for the bedroom plus a small bathroom. Given that Priceline describes the room as being suited for two adults this was a little bit of a let down. That being said everything in the room (except the television which appeared to be a 20 inch CRT [tube] set) was of the highest quality. The bed was superb, and the linens were outstanding. The design was contempory. The furniture small but of first rate qualtiy. The location is excellent. Just cross the street and go seventy steps further and you are in a metro station. EASY. The Eifel tower is an easy walk and the Arc de Triumph is moderate walk. If you use the internet in your room or in the business center you are going to pay a pretty penny. Thirty minutes (not even an hour) in the business center runs 10 Euros.
