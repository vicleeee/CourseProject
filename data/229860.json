It is very convenient in terms of it's closeness to the train station,so no having to trek around town when you get in. The area is a bit like kings Cross in that it attracts people who are homeless and you do see the harder side of Rome when you are around there. Once you have acclimatised to the location, it has lots of benefits, is good for food outlets for fastish food and coffee, there is a supermarket nearby, the tourist buses and all the other transport is also close by and getting home is much less hassle. The hotel itself is joined with the Rimni Hotel and you walk through their lobby to get to the lift, the carpet on the staircase is very well worn and doesn't look great. The room was very clean but the walls were stained as other people have mentioned, the breakfast was fine better on one day than the next, one day lots of choice of cakes another just croissants and other things of course. I advise to just try orange juice from the machine not the mixed juice. Cappucino from machine was nice. Staff were mixed, all the staff within the hotel were lovely and one receptionist was also very nice but a couple of reception staff were quite officious and not warm at all. TV, make sure you use the menu function of the control as if you just flick through the numbers you just get 4 channels. If you use the menu function you get CNBC etc. but only a few English Speaking mainly news. Finding the hotel is easy once you know how. Exit the station through a very large exit, if you see McDonalds, turn around and look the opposite way, you should see another large exit and when you get close to it, look up and you will see a sign saying Via Marsala which is the correct road exit, the road opposite and vertical is Via Marghera and the hotel is just a few yards on the right on that road. To find the Spa supermarket near hotel, exit hotel road and turn and walk left, you will see a covered walkway across the road, the supermarket is a 100 yards further down, it's not that obvious. One of the big tourist bus routes terminates near the hotel, I have forgotten their name but I tend to use them in most cities and if you keep your ticket you get a 10% discount in the next city, I always forget to keep my ticket! Exit the hotel and turn right, the stop is just 20 yards on the station side. They run 2 routes and one goes to this stop but I have the feeling that in the winter they run one route on alternate days, although this is not advertised but they tell you before you buy the ticket if either route is not running, I think the route that goes close to the hotel starts at 30 and 60 mins but you should check this. Re the hotel, I think it is suitable for budget travellers who have realistic expectations.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corfu, Greece", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location,\u201d", "Author": "pennyblossam", "ReviewID": "UR120862856", "Content": "Stayed at Hotel Corot for two nights, very close to Termini Station.

The room was as described. It was plain and a little darkish because of the dark wood ceiling, but not unappealing. It was clean, the bathroom was clean, and the twin beds were comfortable enough so that was good to me. The shower is a square stall and I am a tall, average sized woman and I would not have been able to shave my legs in there without a lot of difficulty. So if you are a big person, this would be uncomfortable for you to get into and certainly to turn around in. There was a bidet in there which we didn't use because we don't like them and it is positioned across from the toilet, not next to it, so you are looking at it when you sit on the toilet. It was clean but I would rather not have looked at it so much. The breakfast was not just a little pastry as a couple people complained. Perhaps they came very late? It was from 7a-10a and we got there about 8-9am every day. There were several pastries, breads, hard boiled eggs, slices of ham and slices of cheese, cereals, a small selection of fruit, and a machine that delivered several types of hot drinks from different coffees to hot milk, to hot chocolate. It was not breakfast at the Ritz but it was a good selection for a budget hotel and we enjoyed our breakfasts. My only complaint and the reason I took away a full star is because the man at the front desk during the day was not very friendly or helpful. So that is the star for customer service. He barely greeted us and didn't even smile when we arrived although I greeted him in Italian (which I have studied a little) and then wanted my print out confirmation of the hotel reservation even though it was already paid for, which he said he knew, and we had already shown him our passports. Of the 3 hotels we stayed at on our trip (one in Paris and the other in Florence) he was the only one who not only asked to see it, but kept it. I found that a little odd but whatever. We found his attitude the most most annoying the day before we left. We asked how much a taxi would be from the hotel to the airport (which is a 1/2 block away from the Termini if you exit the Termini from the right side of the building rather than the front) - incredibly convenient by the way) and he said he didn't know because it's different price from the airport vs to the airport. Also that there would be a night fee (we had to leave before 5am). He waved us off and told us to ask one of the taxis at the Termini. We found this to be incredibly rude and felt he was lying. To work there and have no idea how much a taxi ride to the airport is?? Please. We proceeded to our room and spent over an hour trying to figure it out on our laptop via the free WiFi. We realized 3 things 1) there is a legally set price 40Euro to and from the airport from Termini and 2) there is no night surcharge. However, some taxi drivers will try and cheat you so look for the white taxis with the official symbol on the passenger door and establish the price before you zoom off. However, more importantly we 3) found a bus that runs from 12mn to 5am leaving maybe 4 times in that range, that goes from the Termini to Fiumicino airport and is only 4.50Euro (ten times less than a taxi!), and maybe 7Euro if you buy your ticket on the bus. The bus company is called \"Cotral\". You can find a vendor on the opposite side of the Termini (where all the buses come in and out) that sells tickets and they can tell you where to find that bus stop. Otherwise, if you can leave at a normal hour, just take the metro from the Termini. So the hotel was very conveniently located but the location is a little seedy for those of you who need to be in a nice area. For us the location couldn't have been better and there are 3 levels, of shops, food places, and trains, buses in the Termini. We took the metro at the Termini to the Colosseum and to get to Vatican City. So the location was highly convenient, breakfast was good, room was perfectly fine. Just not great customer service.

Sheets and towels were changed everyday. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived (very early, 11.30am) but when we returned to the hotel 20 minutes later our room was ready and our bags had even been taken up for us. The room wasn't large by any means, but there was more than enough space for us to spread out. We were very pleasantly surprised by the bathroom, which was a good size, newly decorated and even had a bidet and jacuzzi bath. The lift is tiny and only fits 2 people and their bags but that is a minor criticism. It wouldn't have been out of place in an upmarket hotel. The breakfast is a bog standard continental but is regularly restocked and they will make you fresh coffee if you ask, rather than using a vending machine. The location is very good. 1 minute walk from the Termini means you can get any where, and is ideal for getting the train from the airport and using the Metro. If you turn right out of the hotel there are 3 nice restaurants along the street although there isnt too much else around. It is worth going to the restaurants in the side streets on the other side of the Termini. The staff were helpful with directions, gave us a choice of rooms and although we didn't have any problems I'm sure they would have handled them well.

Couldn't have asked for a better location \u2013 2 minutes' walk to Termini Train Station, buses and metro. The location was important for us especially because we had a late train coming in from Florence on one of the nights and didn't want to have to walk a long distance at almost 11 at night, after hearing too many stories about robberies and pickpockets in Rome. Pleasantly surprised that the place around Termini was still bustling with commuters and tourists that night, probably because it was summer with longer daylight. Lots of places around to eat and buy water and snacks. Within the Termini station itself, there were several eateries, a huge bookstore, newspaper vendors and a shopping mall in its basement. Around Corot, many small restaurants serving reasonably priced meals. We had a 15-euros meal at Ristorante \"Alla Lupa\" a few steps away from Corot, comprising a starter (soup or pasta), main course (turkey or chicken), choice of salad or potatoes, choice of dessert or coffee. The spaghetti bolognaise I ordered was a meal unto itself! Hotel service at Corot was really great. We arrived at about 9+ in the morning, not sure if we were too early to check-in and prepared to wait or roam around before they had a room for us. Very happy to be checked-in immediately! Check-in was hassle free, less than 5 minutes. We were shown to our room by a very energetic, practically bursting with positiveness lady by the name of Tina. She was super strong, grabbed our 2 huge heavy luggage into the tiny lift and then ran 3 floors up to help us haul the bags into the room! I was amazed not just by her strength and speed but also by her very positive smiling attitude. What a great welcome! We later also saw Tina doing the housekeeping, as well as helping out at the breakfast room. She was everywhere and always with a great smile! It made a huge difference to our stay! The manageress (sorry, I forgot to take the name) was also extremely nice, ushering us in and allowing us to start breakfast early at 6+ when they usually opened for breakfast at 7. Breakfast was wonderful. Before checking in to this hotel, we were touring Italy with a large tour group and stayed at 6 different hotels, a few of which were international hotel chains. None of their breakfasts came close to Corot's, which had 2 kinds of cold cuts, cheese, pastries, toast, selection of crackers, pate, jam, fruit cocktail and peaches, cereal, juice, tea and selection of coffee from the machine - expresso, americano, mocha. For some reason, Capuccino was freshly brewed and individually served. Everything was free flow. The only thing they didn't have was eggs, which was okay for us after having too much of it anyway earlier on. The room was simple but sufficient space to place our 2 huge luggage plus some other shopping bags. Simple wardrobe with plentiful supply of hangers. Safe deposit box provided. Morning call was activated by using the phone in the room which was convenient and didn't require calling down to reception every night. Limited number of TV channels which all appeared to be in Italian but it didn't really matter to us as we reached back quite late every night and just went to bed. Toiletries provided were shampoo/bath gel, soaps, toothbrush, box of tissues (which seemed a rare thing as most earlier hotels did not provide tissues). Also large bath towels, hand towels and separate towels for bidet. Housekeeping was very good - thanks Tina! Very clean and thorough. The only thing that we didn't particularly like was that the air-con was kept turned off in the day and if you returned early in the evening, you would return to a room that's not cool. A request to reception got it turned on immediately though. I guess it's quite a good thing actually, as it's eco-friendly. All in all, a great friendly safe place to stay in Rome and great value! Tip: If you have heavy trolley luggage, it's better to enter by the Hotel Remini entrance. It's just next door to Corot, which has steps leading up to its reception - Remini's entrance doesn't have steps. The 2 hotels are sort of joined in every way and share the same lift too. Have a friend watch the bags while you hop over to Corot reception next door to check in. You will pass by Remini reception again when you head for the lift to your room.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "singapore", "Title": "\u201cIt's ok\u201d", "Author": "suguna2202", "ReviewID": "UR114820456", "Content": "My objective was to see the city, so even though it was an average, I was only going back to the hotel to shower and sleep.

The man at the desk was the most unpleasant, rude, obnoxious person we have ever had the misfortune of running into on any of our travels to Europe or the US. When we were done checking in with Mister Miseable we all had a sick feeling about Italy and wished that we were back in Ireland. When we went to get in the elevator we discovered that only one person could get in without any luggage. (I actually think it was the dumbwaiter, not the elevator.) So we then lugged our luggage up three flights of stairs covered with red carpet. (We thought it was red anyway, the dirt on the carpet was so bad that it was really hard to tell what color it was). We arrived at the room and opened the door. Fortunately Freddie Krueger was not still in the room but the black mold on the walls was. We all looked at each other and decided to suck it up and spend one night then look for another hotel, forfeiting the next prepaid three nights. To add insult to injury when I hopped in the shower to wash the black mold of f I discovered we had no hot water in the shower. What a way to start a holiday in Italy! Fortunately we found the people at the desk in the morning to be much friendlier and the continental breakfast was adequate. We did end up staying the other three nights but only because there were no rooms available elsewhere.

I traveled with my daughter and we had a room with a couch that turned into a single bed however the king was so large we ended up sleeping on that and using the couch to hold our suitcase and stuff. My parents had the room next to us and also had a king bed but no place to put there suitcase so they liked our room better. The layout of the bathroom was different and they had problems with water leaking out of the shower. The shower pressure and temp is wonderful and we had no problems with water leakage because there was a slight lip that kept the water in. No place to set bottles in the shower but we just put on floor. We both complained of sewer smell once in awhile from the bathroom but it usually didn't last more than an hour. We would just open the window and flush the toilet and it seemed to go away. At night the only thing I could hear was sound of water running above me. I think it was others showering but it went on till wee hours in the am so I always travel with a sound machine and once i turn that on i sleep uninterrupted. The area is very busy because of the train station but we loved the convience to transportation the grocery stores and there is a internet place with computers 2 doors down for $5 an hour but not open real late. There other places nearby cheaper and we tried them, too, since the other ones are open 24 hours $2 an hour aprox. There is a cafe a block further away from the station on the corner and we had small noodle soup and it was like chicken noodle with tiny pieces of noodle and broth. Hit the spot on a cold night. The breakfast is wonderful! My daughter loved the cappacino maker. We had that thing cranking out american coffee, cappicino's, expresso and it made other stuff, too. There was oatmeal,cereal,yogurt,meat,cheese,granola,toast,italian bread,rye bread,prunes,canned peaches,prepacked little pastries, also regular pastries,donuts,croissants. Enough to choose from. Im hard to please and I was a HAPPY healthy eatter. I hate those places that serve digusting fatty breakfast stuff. Here you had at least a choice. Two morning we had tours that picked up at 6:50, so we went down at 6:30 and the staff flew around gettting the food out early so we could eat before we left. Breakfast doesn't start till 7am so we were surprised that they jumped into action and wanted us to eat. The staff is very quiet and doesn't say much but they really seem to want to give you want is described on there website. Not much into the other stuff with tours or internet. In the states I usually stay at Hilton Brand hotels, so this was definatly different, but we are barely in the room and i was trying to stay in my budget. Yes the room did have black stuff on the walls under the cloth cusioned wallpaper but it didn't smell and the building is really old so i guess it's to be expected. Everything was mostly clean, just old and i like that the floors are wooden not carpeting. The bathroom is totally tiled and mostly clean the walls could use a scrubbing. I like the little frig to keep our stuff in. They have it filled with stuff to buy but we just set that stuff aside and bought our own stuff. No problem from them and no extra charge. Made a few local calls and that was 10 cents each. The hotel just needs a place to make coffee or tea in the evenings and it would be absolutely perfect. It's 4 to 6 euros for a coffee/tea in a cafe and you don't get any refills so we got tired of drinking cold water in the room. I never asked at the hotel but didn't see anything offered. There is a safe in the room and I used it. Works a little different than in the states but i figured it out. The Tv is also wierd but there is only a couple of news channels in english so we only had it on for short times anyway. They have cable but just a few channels in english and then lots of other languages. We stayed a week, so if you have any questions feel free to ask. We used the Viator website to book our trips to Assissi and pompeii. Also the vatican tour and the Collesium tour. We liked everything we did. The tours guides were good except the bus guide on the assissi/orviento tour was a little lazy so we never really knew what was going on but the local guides were good--the tour was suppose to include tasting local produce--ugh it was yuckie crap they took us to this place where we had lunch they have a little store in the back. It was small and they had only one wine sample very bitter and the other stuff wasn't good either. Lunch was ok but I didn't eat it.--it was pasta in alfredo type sauce with meat and I'm vegetarian. The pompeii trip the tour guide had lots of information and she even took menu choices for vegan's so that trip was alot better. We went to the Villa Borghese--need reservations!!! and the cute zoo which costs i think $10 euros each, but what a hassle using public transportation to get here. Got there cheap but it was eventful. We only used public transporation which saves alot of money. My dad got pickpocketed on the metro the second day. Even had his wallet chained and zipped and they unzipped it grabbed the cash and ran as soon as the doors opened. Think the girls were working as a group so watch out!!! Keep everything out of sight and preferrable under clothing or leave in safe in room. If you get hungry for a burger Hard Rock Cafe was wonderful.

Also the main bus station is next to the station and the open top city bus tours start from here. The area itself is not really touristy but we never spent much time here. The station itself has many modern shopping facilities and there are many restauants in the surrounding area if you dont like venturing to far from the hotel for a meal in the evening. The hotel was just right for us. Not luxurious but very clean and comfortable rooms with a modern bathroom. No bath but a very impressive shower unit, which I must admit we had a few laughs trying to figure out how it worked as there were many different features.Our room was cleaned daily to a very high standard. The staff all spoke very good english and were polite, friendly and helpful. On arrival we were checked in with no problems and one of the staff took our cases to the small lift and said she would meet us outside our room. She had to walk up to the third floor as there was only room for us and our case. She met us and showed us how the door opened and how the lighting worked and wished us a pleasant stay. There is a safety deposit box in the room at no extra charge and a useful well stocked mini bar. There is a television but only the news channel is in english and the occasional other programe if you can find it. Breakfast was ample cereals ,fruit, toast ,cheese , meats, yogurts tea and coffee and the breakfast seating area was very pleasant. On leaving the hotel we asked the reception if we could leave our luggage as our flght was due in the afternoon and it was no problem for them. Rome is a beautiful city and even 4 nights was not long enough for us. A recommended day out of the city out is to go to Tivoli and visit the villas with the fountain gardens.
