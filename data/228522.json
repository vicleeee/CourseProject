Be prepared to use taxi, public transportation or rental car to get around. We were travelling with two small children and stayed in a Suite, a very nice room for families. Short walk to a small but very good supermarked, and approxomatly 20 min. walk to a area with several local restaurants. The breakfast included was a bit boring, but OK.

It's true that there is not much to do / see in the local vicinity (there didn't seem to be any restaurants or cafes nearby either). A taxi to central Madrid costs around \u20ac20. The rooms are really nice and modern with wood floors and comfortable beds, there is a speaker with a usb connection, but it didn't seem to work for me. The bathroom is also lovely and modern, the only slight strange thing being the floor of the shower - it's made of perforated metal, which is not very comfortable for standing on for very long. I would give it a 5, but knocked one point off as the room service / restaurant menu is very short and not very vegetarian-friendly. Also, there is an iron you can borrow, but the ironing board is a portable, tiny one, which makes ironing adult clothes quite tricky!", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing, friendly, comfortable and good value\u201d", "Author": "Alan J", "ReviewID": "UR130890362", "Content": "I often stay in Madrid on business but usually travel into the city from Alcobendas for a hotel.

We landed in Madrid only to find out my parents flight had been cancelled. I called the hotel and thankfully reached a fantastic front desk person named Magda. She was absolutely reassuring and understanding...just what I needed after long, hectic flights all the way from Alaska. She guided us there and helped me track down my parents alternate flight plan. Put me at ease completely. While waiting for my parents to arrive, we walked into the neighborhood near the hotel, found a little supermarket, farmacia, ATM, but not much else. The next day when my parents arrived, Magda gave us simple instructions on how to catch the bus into the city center. It was really not complicated, but we opted for a taxi on the way back. I enjoyed being away from the noise and fuss of the city. The rooms are very, very modern. A little too much for my liking. They were comfortable enough, but the glass bathroom walls were a bit much. Free mini bar made up for it some though. Breakfast room was well stocked and service very nice.
