I could say many things about the hotel, all of them probably said in previous critics: the rooms are big, comfortable, very clean, fantastic bathroom and amenities...and the hotel is just great. But I would like to say something more.- the staff at the hotel is incredible. They make you feel special. We were celebrating something very important, my parent's 50th wedding anniversary. Having read that the hotel had rooms with view to the street and view to a courtyard, I wrote a message to the hotel asking if it was possible to get a room with a nice view for my parents. Not only they got this, they were offered a bottle of champagne and we were upgraded to a junior suite. We had a bad experience on our way to Paris as we had an incident on the road and arrived late, cold after waiting 4 hours on the road, a bit upset....afraid the trip would be ruined. When we got to the hotel it was such a relief and bright thing to find the attentions that the manager had taken for us. From the deep of our hearts, THANKS. You made this trip a once in a lifetime experience. My little girl also got a nice present from the hotel, some toys and 2 books. What else can I say. This is a hotel with a \"soul\", not an impersonal one from the many hotel chains you can find in the city. The best experience we could have dreamed about.

We upgraded to the junior suite because it was important to us to have a nice size room with a sofa to sit on. Altho the deluxe suites would have probably been a fair size (we meant to view one but forgot), we were very happy with the size of the junior suite and felt like we had ample room to spread out and relax. The bed was very comfortable and let me tell you, this place knows what a good pillow is! Pillows are a big deal to us. After having come from Londond where we stayed at a bottom of the barrel Travelodge and were offered pancakes as pillows, it was a welcome treat to have perfectly plush pillows that weren't too high or too low. Very nice! The breakfast buffet was wonderful, and the coffee, oh my, the French know how to make coffee! Thoroughly enjoyed that every morning! It was nice to be able to have breakfast in the hotel as part of the daily price. This hotel is well located and yet tucked away on a side street away from the hustle and bustle. We took the Eurostar from London to Paris and were able to get off the Eurostar, transfer to the Paris metro and take that to within 2 blocks of our hotel and walk over, rather than pay for an expensive taxi ride. The metro system is wonderful and we used it a lot. There is also a Velib bicycle station right outside the hotel where you can rent bikes, which we did twice. Just be aware that your credit card will be charged 150 euros for each bike and will take up to two weeks to be adjusted to the actual charges for usage.

We weren't disappointed and it was as good as we remembered. The reception staff were welcoming when we arrived mid-morning and set our expectations on when the room would be ready, i.e. the previous guests had gone, room not cleaned yet, but should be done in about an hour. We asked them to book a particular restaurant for us the following night and they made a note straight away. They were also ready to store our luggage and when we arrived back in the late afternoon, it had been taken up to our room. All the various reception staff were friendly, helpful and patient and appreciative of our attempts to practise our rusty French. The room was slightly smaller and darker than the one we had last year, being at the back rather than the front of the hotel, but it was still a good size and bigger than most Parisian rooms. The lighting was also very good with lights on the inside edge of the wardrobe doors, there was plenty of storage and at least 3 full length mirrors. We like the double doors between the corridor and the bedroom, so any corridor noise is minimised. The bathroom was spotless, with an endless supply of hot water, toiletries, towelling bath robes and slippers and the illuminated magnifying mirror helped with shaving and the application of make up. The bath is deep and there are plenty of soft white towels. The whole hotel was kept clean and tidy and there was an impressive display of fresh flowers in reception. Every time we walked in or out, the doorman leapt to open the inner door and to greet us. The breakfast room was very quiet, but as I am not a morning person that suited me. Service was quick and food was replenished without needing to ask for it. There was a good assortment of everything and the pastries were tasty, especially the pain au raisin. The bar is expensive, as other guests have commented, but it's to be expected in a central Paris hotel. After a hard day's walking, we enjoyed settling into the comfortable armchairs sipping excellent ice-cold gin and tonics and nibbling the accompanying crisps and nuts; David the barman was charming. If price is an issue, then there are plenty of bars in the vicinity and the one opposite serves a good beer. It doesn't seem, however, to be open on Sundays, so you might have to walk a few metres further. It's a good idea to take the reception staff's recommendation on restaurants. They ask what sort of place you are looking for and then advise what there is and book it for you if you wish. We ate at two good restaurants they suggested last year, both within 10 minutes walk and went back to one of them this year. There are hundreds of restaurants, brasseries, cafes and shops nearby, too many to mention, but there is a handy little coffee shop/patisserie (Brioche Doree) on the Rue de Rennes, on the right hand side as you walk towards the Montparnasse Tower. A stroll through the market on Edgar Quinet on a Saturday morning is a must and there is a good sized Monoprix supermarket on the Rue du Depart next to the Tower. It is only a very short metro journey from either St Placide or Montparnasse Bienvenue to get to any of the main tourist attractions.

The room was a \"junior suite\", effectively a longish attic room with a bathroom at one end and a wc at the other, sloping ceilings in part. Decor was very French, fabric covered walls etc. Breakfast was buffet style and was well presented, if somewhat limited for a hotel in this price range. Bar prices are also very expensive and the bar should be avoided at all costs; the bill for a brandy and a soft drink was almost 30 euro! In short, this hotel is probably ok if you get a good rate (and avoid the bar), but at anything above 100 euro it is best given a miss. The Hotel Ampere (avenue de Villiers) is a better hotel for instance, and tends to be a lot cheaper, and I'm sure that there are many other examples of better value out there.

The front desk staff were very accomodating and spoke fluent English. The hotel charged 15 Euros for a USA power chord converter so you should bring your own and save some money. As a business traveler, the Internet is painful. Your 10 Euro a day fee does not allow two wireless connections at the same time so I could not work while my son was on his computer. The hotel also blocks Skype and IP phone traffic so this is one reason why I would not stay here again. Since I work while away and check email and call the US often, the hotel's Internet policy is restrictive and outdated. Internet speeds were good for email but not for video. So for the 10 Euro a day fee, this is no bargain. If you don't care about the Internet, this is a very nice place to stay.

Many cafe/restaurant near Vavin station (6-7 min.) open on Sunday. Not only traditional French dishes including crape but also Thai, Indian, Chinese, Lebanese restaurants are available in the area around the hotel. Many bistros on Rue du Cherche Midi were so interested but many closed due to Christmas. We did not use Metro but took the public bus at \"Rennes-Littre\" stop or \"Rennes-St.Placide\"stop. The hotel will provide brief guidance with a copy. Bus No.95 direct to Louvre/Opera/Vanves Flea Market, No.96 direct to Marais district/Vosges Park was very convenient.

All this was done and confirmed by return e-mail. At reception we were given a handwritten note from Sebastian (very good English) confirming the details of the restaurant booking and another envelope containing a voucher for 2 glasses of Champagne at the bar to celebrate our anniversary! Staff very pleasant and welcoming at breakfast also. Breakfast is self service, which we prefer and there was plenty to choose from - orange juice, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, fresh fruit salad, cereals, yoghurt, various breads, croissants etc., cheese, ham and also hard-boiled or scambled eggs, sausage and bacon for those wanting something hot - more than sufficient.

The major attractions are close, but probably not close enough to walk to them unless you are used to walking long distances.

We always rely on trip advisor to help us decide among hotels that we have found based on research and friends' recommendations. We had some doubts about the Victoria Palace's general location mentioned by several reviewers but thought that the attributes they wrote about would outweigh the slightly offbeat locale. We absolutely love Paris not least because of its beauty and interesting street life. The immediate area (several block radius) of the V-P is among the least attractive and least interesting we have experienced. A good paint job and new signage on the adjacent hotel garage would help to mitigate that feeling. The overall location, while not the best, is ok in terms of accessibility to transportation and attractions. Our room at the V-P was good sized and the bathroom big and beautiful. There was more than ample storage. We faced the courtyard--quiet but not providing a lot of brightness. The decor while somewhat \"over the top\" is well done and we found it attractive and pleasing. Our friends were in a junior suite and it was quite lovely and very large. The staff is what makes the Victoria Palace special. The concierge-front desk people, especially Sebastian, were truly exceptional--always cheerful, spoke great English, thus compensating beautifully for my halting French, and helpful in fulfilling requests major and minor. The entire staff (with the exception of the breakfast room wait staff) were friendly, beautifully trained and anxious to make the extra effort to ensure that the guests' stay at their hotel is a great one. The breakfasts (included in our web-found deal) were very good and plentiful by French standards--variety of rolls, breads, cereals, meats, cheeses, fruit, yogurt and and scrambled and boiled eggs. There is no restaurant in the hotel but our friends had an excellent experience with a room service dinner one evening.

This was our 1st trip together to Europe. I did a lot of homework before I finally booked this hotel. For a 4 star hotel, their price is reasonable with breakfast included, and we were very impressed by the endless good reviews on Tripadvisor. We stayed in a deluxe room on the 6th floor (non-suite) for the week. We had 2 huge beautiful balconies outside our room, and had the view of a nice Parisian neighborhood that took my breath away the moment I stepped in the room. Our bathroom was all marble, very, very roomy and bright for a city hotel. The sheets and towels were always clean and fresh, It truly felt like home in this place and we very much looked forward to \"going home\" to rest after a whole day of busy sightseeing in Paris!! The other wonderful thing about this hotel is that it's only less than 2 minutes walk to the Metro, where you can take a direct train to the Paris Nord train station for intercity and international travel, as well as most of the sights in Paris. We were able to catch a train @ 6:13 in the morning to Amsterdam by taking the metro!! The hotel is surrounded by boutiques, shops, cafes and restaurants. It's in a semi traditional Parisian neighborhood, so you may walk into a restaurant with zero English on the menu like what happened to us on our 1st day!!! But it was such a wonderful experience, and we walked out the restaurant with full tummies and smiles. All of the hotel staff we spoke with spoke very good English, and were very nice.

I expected a classy boutique type hotel, but instead arrived to a Parisian version of a Holiday Inn Express with bright wall paper. It was very empty(surprising for the high rating-25-50% capacity?) and the few guests were mostly US or UK liesure travellers. While it was clean, quiet(it was almost empty), and had a good breakfast, the negatives were overwhelming. 1) The beds are poor, hostel to 2 star quality. I think the homeless man living on a front porch of a vacant building on Vaugiraurd(close to hotel) had a better bed. I can say this, becuase he was often entertaining guests as we walked by and they looked comfortable. 2) location- its got a 6thA address, but its really far from tourist sights 3) The toilet is located at the front of the hotel room, away from the nice bath and sink in the back(They leave a Charmin wipe packet on the floor to make up for a sink) The safe too is located in this front area. This is an issue becuase the door that seals off the toilet/safe area from the room makes this area vunerable to abrupt walkins by hotel staff. On 4 occasions(various vague reasons or to ask for a linen turndown) that we know of, staff walked in because we couldnt hear the knock because the 2nd door. The one time I did hear the 'knock' , it was faint at best. I think they shouldnt enter when the shower is running, and you could hear that from the hallway. This is creepy because you can be caught with your pants down or safe open while showering. The last 2 days we kept the do not distrub sign out and locked the door always. 4) Taxi service called by hotel- We planned to take a taxi and relax on our way to the airport. Upon checkout they called a local cab. The taxi promptly broke down in front of the hotel after we got in. After 5-10 minutes of trying to start the car, he put the hazards on and left the cab blocking the 1 way st. After cars honking, I had to push it out of the way so traffic could pass as hotel employees just watched. I asked for another cab, but none came. They let the 1st cabbie call his friend to jump him. This other cab had jumper cables, was 20 min away but started his meter when he was called(there is a taxi stand 1 minute away and VP allows this?) By this time, Im going to be late if I make it at all & a 100E cab fare for the pleasure because he wont go to the airport until they fix the first cab(meter running of course)- What a joke! Still zero help from Victoria Palace. At that time we ran to the metro(the blue line has a 25 minute ride to CDG where cabs need an hour) and made it to CDG in the nick of time- but we could have hurt ourselves running with luggage. Btw- as we left the cab, the cabbie that couldnt speak English laughed and said something like 'OK, go but I thought you needed to get to the airport'' in reasonable english.

The whole hotel was clean and nicely decorated and the staff could not have been more helpful. The reception staff were excellent at giving directions and telling you what bus to get to the attractions and everyone spoke English. The area the hotel was in was really good - some of the reviews on here made it seem like it was out of the way, but I didn't think so. The Montparnasse area was full of shops and restaurants and the bus stops/metro was no more than a two or three minute walk away. We walked to the Louvre (it took about 25 minutes, but it was a pleasant walk past all the shops etc) and we also walked to Notre Damme (again about 25 minutes). It was about 20 minutes on a local bus to the Eiffel Tower and about the same to the Arc de Triumphe. We got the metro to Sacre Cour and that only took about 20 minutes too. It was really easy to get around and the hotel staff told you what bus to get, where to stand to catch the bus and where to get off at the other end.

We immediately had this important feeling of \"coming home\", something my wife and I truly treasure after long days of sight seeing.

I booked the hotel as a surprise for his birthday and paid more money especially as I wanted a luxurious hotel as we have been disappointed in the past. The hotel is in a pretty good area, easily accessible to metro,busses and restaurants. The street just off the hotel is full of shops which are all open until about 7p.m. We were pleased with the reception that greeted us as it is smart and the lady who was on reception was very polite and effecient when sorting us out with our room. The room itself (606) was a decent size, carpet was well worn, the decor not to our taste but it is an old fashioned hotel. The mini bar and snacks were expensive and the fridge didnt work. The flat screen t.v is nice but we could only find 2 english channels but mtv france is worth a look just for a laugh lol.The bed is quite hard but not so it made much difference to us sleeping (we were always too tired to care after very busy days).It is hard to get the room to the temperature you require especially at night, it was always either too warm or cold. There was a safe in our room which was free to use and in the wardrobe came with dressing gowns and slippers. The bathroom is nice, made with marble and with 3 mirrors, one full length, a large mirror over the sink and a close up mirror for shaving. Quite a random point, but we found it very difficult to get the plugs out of the sink and the bath. There is a pretty good hair dryer, a selection of shampoo,conditioner,shower gel, body lotion and other bathroom necessities. The water was off for the majority of 2 days we were staying there but were we were given no notice of this and offered no apologies or compensation of any kind. We didnt mind but they could have been more considerate. There is a large selection at breakfast but we found the scrambled eggs runny and there was some mouldy fruit in the fruit basket, not very proffesional. Some staff were good whereas others were unhelpful, when we asked if there were any good chinese restaurants in the area we were given a map and told they thought there was one on a corner, he couldnt tell us what it was called but he thought there was one there, there wasnt. Also, we asked for a taxi to be booked for a certain time and when we went outside the meter was already at 10 euros, when I asked at reception why this was all he said was that in paris when you ring for a taxi you are charged for it from when you ring for it. I asked why he rang it 15 minutes earlier than we asked for it and he just shrugged his shoulders. When asked if they would do anything about it he just said no. By the time I got back to the taxi it had gone up even more but we had no choice but to get in it as we needed to get to the airport. There was also a member of staff who came into the room on 2 occasions where we didnt hear him knock and even though the 'please do not disturb' sign was on. The cleaners come in your room regardless of the sign as well so be warned. If visiting Paris this is a good base to have as it is in a quiet part of the city without being too far away and is generally a nice hotel. We found a combination of metro and walking was perfect for us as it allowed us to see everything we wanted in a short time. An all day metro pass is 5.60 euros and allows you to get around paris much quicker than if you were walking. I'd recommend a good metro guide as it makes travelling around so much easier. Also when booking the hotel check around websites for good deals as i paid a lot less than the 320 euros a night which is advertised. Overall Paris is a beautiful place to visit which I would advise anyone to go and see even though we found many of the French people very rude. Not sure if this is their culture or just because they dont like tourists?", "Date": "August 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cA quality experience\u201d", "Author": "MikeB99", "ReviewID": "UR8278842", "Content": "We had a four night stay at this hotel at the end of July. We have stayed in Paris many times, know Paris well, and this is the best experience we have had. We booked the hotel through Hotel Connect online, and had a very good rate for this 4 star hotel which, for Paris, represented good value. It is no distance at all from the Seine, just a few minutes on the bus. Four routes travel down the Rue de Rennes, and the stops are 3 minutes' walk from the hotel. The Montparnasse metro is 5 minutes' walk. As Parisians will tell you, there is really no centre to this city. So, easy access to transport, is vital. In our experience, it is much pleasanter and better value to stay in an area like this which is not right next to the tourist attractions. In any case, since Paris is a city where you will always have to travel some distance to see the sights; even if you get a hotel next to the Louvre, it will still be a longish journey to La D\u00c3\u00a9fense, or the Eiffel Tower. The side street location gets you a good night's sleep, well away from the otherwise inevitable city noise. As a family group, we requested a twin room and a double room, preferably adjacent. We were given a room which had one entrance, a lobby, two separate doors, leading to two separate rooms with private facilities. The quality of the decor was outstanding, and it is notable that the recent refurbishment has used materials which can endure the wear and tear of heavy tourist use. The style is deliberately victorian pastiche - and every attention to detail makes it charming and different from the bland chain hotels which are taking over in Paris. Cleanliness is of a high standard, and it is reassuring to see the House Manageress touring the hotel at almost any time of day you happen to be there, checking the rooms and the work that is being done. All the staff, from reception to service personnel, are immaculately dressed, extremely helpful, and welcoming. The buffet breakfast is very good indeed, with a wide choice of European food, and plenty of healthy options. Homemade preserves, lots of fresh fruit, but also traditional bacon and eggs, mean that all but the American taste for stacks of pancakes and waffles is catered for. Again, comparing this with other hotels, you would not find better at this price, and often much more basic. There are several cafes and restaurants within a short walk of the hotel, if you prefer to eat locally.

The Rooms are traditionally decorated and oh so roomy for France. The bathrooms are great! Especially after walking over 12 hours a day, to come home to a deep marble tub is the best! Beds are comfortable and the pillows dont give you a neckache. I had a deluxe room and it was just all that you could ask for, my bathroom was very large, but be aware, other deluxe rooms can have smaller bathrooms. Because of my location i also had two additional big closets ( a total of 4 altogether) in the entry way to the room! Very quiet corner location. Rm 110. The ground floor is Zero. You cannot go wrong with this room. USE a travel agent to book this hotel. I got a rate that included breakfast and all taxes and it was over $150 Euros less then the stated rate, especially if you book way in advance. I had my reservation for over 6months. Location: Just fine, within walking distance of cafes, St. Germain, Luxembourg Gardens, Bon Marche, Rue Cherche Midi, etc. Two convenient Metros. Special Note, the Montparnasse Metro Line feeds into many others and I found it the easiest and most effective to getting around the city. The St. Placide lines only really serves the St. Germain, Notre Dame and Latin quarter. Hotel sits on side street. Very important for noise control. Most all other hotels on very very busy streets. Dont miss the Rue Cherche Midi neighborhood, turn left when you leave the hotel and go over a couple of blocks. Famous Pouilane Bakery and adorable shops, keep walking and you will find anything you could look for. Staff: Formal and Professional, they will answer any question you ask. Be specific, they know english but are very literal. You can exchange small amounts of money and even mail your postcards at the front desk. The door staff will speak every time you enter and leave. The rest of the staff kind of avoid eye contact unless you have a question. Not in a rude way, but in a \"we dont want to bother you, kind of way.\" Breakfast: Adequate. But you will find no better, american breakfast is non-existent and as it should be. You may get tired of the same thing every day but I advise you to do the breakfast, later in the day you will be glad. Try to get it included in your room rate. Ours was and then you feel like it is for free! If not many local patisseries around. I would not hesitate to stay here again and recommend to everyone. I researched hotels for months, found none better for location, quality and comfort. After arriving and seeing how many of the hotels windows face Bustling NY type of streets i was oh so glad i chose this hotel.

Most of the reviews are accurate but since we rely so much on trip advisor it seems only fair to add our observations too. Pros: The rooms are clean and suprisingly soundproof. We never heard our neighbors one either side and only heard the people above us on one morning when we presume some kids were running around:). The shower has good pressure and the bathroom was a good size. The staff was very nice. Isabelle (front desk) had some awesome dining suggestions (try C'est Mon Plaisar and Allard-- both awesome) and was always available to help and very pleasant. Habib (in the bar/lounge) was by far the most friendly person we met in Paris -- tell him his friends from Fort Worth say hello. The breakfast was fine (but just average) and if more had been open outside the hotel ( A LOT is closed on new years day in particular) we probably would have preferred to eat nearby for the ambiance. The hotel is quiet and intimate (we were suprised at breakfast to even see so many other people b/c it never felt busy or loud or crowded). There was a computer available in the lobby area to check email, etc.. which was convenient too. Overall we would definitely recommend this hotel -- especially to first timers. Cons: Really the only one to us was that the hotel was not quite as centrally located as we would have liked. It is in a good area w/ shopping, dining etc.. and has a lot of charm. In fact, although we would love to have stayed at George V itself we have to say we much preferred VP's area to the Champs area -- which would have been more inconvenient and which felt like a mall! The location problem for us was because we preferred to walk rather than take the metro or buses (so we could see everything!) so VP was a little more out of the way from some of the big \"tourists attractions\". It is easy to take the metro or buses though and avoid this issue -- so it is kind of our own fault. Also the beds are really hard. While this does not bother us at all we know from many trip advisor reviews that this is an issue for a lot of travelers generally so if you fall into that category be forewarned.

One we liked was called Le Rousseau in the Rue du Cherche-Midi, just 5 mintues walk away. The building next door is undergoing some refurbishment at present and some noise can start from about 8am.

The hotel is located on the Left Bank, on a very quiet side street off Rue de Rennes, about a 5-minute walk from the train station \"Gare Montparnasse\" and the Metro subway system. Based on a price comparison to 4-Star hotels on the Right Bank, this hotel was an incredible deal ! We had a \"deluxe room\", which was a nice size (normal American standard-sized room) with a very comfortable queen-sized bed. The room and bathroom were very clean, and the room had flowered, cloth wallpaper, a very clean carpet, and a ~17-inch flat panel TV. The bathroom had marble walls and floor, and very nice toiletries were provided each day. The room was straightened twice each day - once in the late morning and once in the early evening, including turn-down service with chocolates on the bed and a hand-written note indicating the anticipated weather for the next day. The front desk staff were extremely helpful, and very willing to call our selected restaurant to make a dinner reservation for us, and to call our car rental company to confirm our car rental (I had requested this since our French is not great). The front desk manager (hotel manager?) was extremely nice. The hotel lobby is beautifully decorated and looks exactly like the photos on their website. We initially were given a room on Floor 3 (the lobby was considered Floor 0, so our room was 4 floors up from the lobby). When I saw the elevator near the front desk and saw that it was very small compared to American standards (maybe it would fit 3 people ), I mentioned to the porter that I would rather walk up the stairs. The front desk manager overheard me and immediately insisted that we take a room on the 1st Floor before I even took a few steps up the stairway - within 30 seconds he had the room changed - what incredible service ! The breakfast was served in a very clean dining room adjacent to the lobby and was quite a spread - the cold items were various cheeses, various cold cuts, various fruit, yogurt, granola, and various breads/pastries, while the hot items were scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausage. The coffee was great !! The same types of food were provided each day, For shopping, there were many small, upscale stores within a block on Rue de Rennes.

We decided to stay at the Victoria based solely on Tripadvisor reviews. The reviews were accurate and the hotel is a wonderful little gem! I was initially slightly apprensive when our taxi driver had to get out his map to find rue Blaise Desgoffe but the hotel is only half a block off rue de Renne and about two blocks from Montparnasse square. The location is ideal for shopping, dining and sight seeing. Also about two blocks from the Metro in either direction( north/south). Accomadations were very nice. Large rooms with large comfortable beds, newly redone marble laden bathrooms, nice furniture with tasteful wall and window treatments. The rooms were a little hot and we could only really regulate the room temperature by opening the windows. This worked fine in March but I can't comment on the A/C in summer. Small flat screen TV in each room (nice) and free interet access in a small room off the hotel foyer (we didn't bring a lap top but I'll NEVER go abroad again without one. Breakfast buffet was included with our booking. This food was fine, plentiful and Parisian. I would not say that this was the quality of meal that you're going to rave to your friends about when you get back home. However, you can save that rave for dinner. The concierge recommended a small local restaurant for dinner. This was too small for my liking(limited menu) but my wife loved it. It's kind of hard to go wrong with the food in Paris (especially after just being in London). The hotel staff were attentive, helpful and friendly; nothing lost or stolen. They really helped us put together a plan for getting across the city to the train station after the city was paralyzed by a student demonstration and taxis couldn't cross through the demonstration. The hotel location is quiet at night and this was an added bonus to the tired tourist. The only potential problem with the Victoria is the fact that there is only one central staircase to act as an egress in the event of a fire. I am not trying to be an alarmist but if there was a fire in the middle of the hotel then there might be no way to get out except a window. All our windows opened on to a central atrium without access to the street. I suspect that this situation is common to many of the older hotels in Europe but I'm trying to be candid and accurate. I really enjoyed my stay at the Victoria and would not hesitate to return again.

My husband and I are frequent travellers to big cities; during the past few years we have always stayed in four or five star hotels (in New York, London, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Mexico City) so this review is based on our experiences at the Hotel Victoria Palace compared to other four star hotels in major cities. I had been to Paris twice before this trip but had never stayed in the left bank side, so I used the hotel reviews posted on TripAdvisor to make my final decision about Victoria Palace. We were very pleased and relieved when we got there that the reviews were quite accurate about the hotel. The staff is well-trained, attentive and friendly. They all speak good English, if you don't speak French and need help with booking reservations for restaurants, shows, etc. The rooms are very clean and well maintained. Water pressure for the toilet and shower is very good too, so you won't have to huddle under the shower head with water trickling down you. For those who are internet and e-mail addicts (like my husband), you can get internet connection (and wireless connection if your laptop is set up for it). The rooms are equipped with a full bathroom, hairdryer, magnifying mirror in bathroom, television, air conditioning, mini-bar, phone of course, but there were other amenities not listed on their website which we found very convenient and to our liking. For example, to charge your electric appliances from the US (cell phones, laptop, shaver, etc), you need an American to French outlet adaptor, but there is no need to buy or bring one from the US since you can borrow one from the hotel. Dry cleaning and laundry services are of course available, but a clothesline attached to the bathroom wall was very handy for us, to wash undergarments and other delicates. We also had a security box in our room to keep our valuables- I imagine that all rooms are equipped with them. Another great feature of the hotel was its location. It is very conveniently located to the metro stops St. Placide, Rennes and Montpanasse-Bienvenue. We prefer window-shopping, people watching and walking, so we walked everywhere, including the Orsay Museum, Pompidou, Louvre, Printemps department store, Guimet museum from our hotel. The owner of the hotel also knows what he's talking about when it comes to good food. When you check-in, they will give you a list of restaurants nearby (all walking distance) that they recommend. At first we tried places we looked up ourselves in our guidebooks but soon gave up trying because the hotel's recommendations were far superior and accurate. I think we tried six of the restaurants they recommended and they were all absolutely wonderful and reasonably priced. If we had anything negative to say about this hotel it would probably be their breakfast and their bed. We didn't think the breakfast there is anything special, though it wasn't bad either. They don't use down comforters for their beds (which would be a really nice plus) but instead use those thin hotel blankets and hard cotton sheets which are not very comfortable (especially when you've gotten used to more hotels like the Westin with their \"Heavenly Beds\" -- good down comforters covered in high thread count cotton sheets).

One egg dish, bacon and sausage with a variety of cereals, cheeses and meats, fruts. Croissants are declicious. It is pricey 22$US and if not included you would do better going to one of the cafe's. Take a right outside the hotel onto the main strip and the I think the first right is a great bakery on the left and down a little is a famous butcher with Rotisserie food prepared. Delicious augratin potatoes. If this is your first trip to Paris I recommend you take The Paris first tour to get an overall of the city. We took the Versailles tour which I thought was not worth it. The guide just dropped us off at the Palace and came back an hour later. He did though give us an overview of Versaille and we stopped at one of the historical stops in Versaille.

We would definitely stay here again!", "Date": "September 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, N.Y.", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel!\u201d", "Author": "NelidaNewYork_N_Y_", "ReviewID": "UR3907561", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the Victoria Palace for six nights and we were extremely pleased with the service and well decorated and kept rooms. The staff is so pleasant and are always willing to go the extra mile in providing service. The staff is excellent ! This is definitely a great place to stay during a vacation. They make a great cup of hot chocolate also. The hotel is within a 15 minute walk to the Luxembourg Gardens, which is beautiful. There are many great restaurants, shopping mall and close to the Metro. I would definitely stay there again.

The hotel itself is close to all the major attractions (only a short metro ride) and is in a nice quiet street close to some good high street shops. The whole experience was truly brilliant. The room was full of character and we had a decent enough view from the balcony. The staff were excellent and the place was spotless. Breakfast was fab, lots of really nice goodies laid on. And for a change the bar prices were not a total rip-off but typical hotel prices. I really cannot praise this hotel enough. We have a wonderful stay there and would not hesitate to go back.", "Date": "August 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3640319", "Content": "My husband and I spent our anniversary in Paris at the Victoria Palace Hotel.
