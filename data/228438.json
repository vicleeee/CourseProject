We stayed in a king deluxe room which didnt have an impressive a view as the hotel made out but the standard was still good. However we were a bit upset to find a toenail under our sheets. They have a sign in the rooms saying that in order to conserve energy they only wash their sheets every 3 days but I would have imagined they changed the sheets in between customers. I phoned down to explain and was offered free breakfast which was nice if it wasnt for the fact that on our arrival we were already offered free breakfasts! The staff however was lovely and helpful and the room was nice but I wouldnt have expected to have body parts in the bed, biscuits would have been much more of a room welcome. Also we had to call down for permission to open a window. The hotel is quite far from the centre but a walkable distance and easy to get to by tram. The nice thing about it being far is that you really do get a nice peace and quiet when you sleep, until about 10am when the cleaners hoover in the coridoor and feel the need to bang the hoover right up against your door. Not the worst thing to happen as we needed a wake up call but again i would expect a higher standard from the Hilton. Worth staying in if you use all the ammenities, wonderful staff, nice area and clean rooms (except for the toenail)", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, bad internet!\u201d", "Author": "FlaviaGois", "ReviewID": "UR128187390", "Content": "We spent a lovely weekend in Amsterdam, the Hotel was perfect, personal very attentive, the room was awesome, very plush and spacious, the only bad thing was the paid internet connection, for a Hotel of this level they should offer a better service.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Experience\u201d", "Author": "Funky12", "ReviewID": "UR128037412", "Content": "Arrived early a.m. after long haul flight from Melbourne Australia.

The hotel is located in an up scale residential neighborhood just outside of central Amsterdam. Overall, I would say this is a solid 3 star property (definitely not a 5 star), but is rather expensive for what is offered. Pros: 1) Located in a quite residential neighborhood on a canal. Away from the crowds of central Amsterdam provides a peaceful setting. 2) Hotel was built several decades ago, but washroom in our room appears to have been newly renovated. 3) Easy parking right out front of hotel. 4) Easy access to central Amsterdam via tram stop just a short walk away. Tram passes can be purchased at concierge desk and charged to room. 5) Friendly and welcoming staff. 6) Hotel is very clean and well maintained. 7) Comfortable bed. Neutral 1) The hotels Roberto's Italian restaurant offers decent food, with decent service. Nothing to fault, but not spectacular either. Cons 1) Location outside of central Amsterdam may not be ideal for many travellers. Taxis are extremely expensive in Amsterdam if you choose not to take the tram. 2) No restaurants or cafes in direct vicinity of hotel. However, there is a Starbucks about a 5-10 min walk away which is a good alternative for a quick breakfast rather than pay for the over priced hotel buffet (see below). 3) Food prices are extremely expensive. 27 Euros for breakfast buffet, 23 Euros for a club sandwich. 4) Limited room service menu for breakfast (same price as breakfast buffet) 5) Their cafe closes on weekends. Strange. I imagine the cafe is on site to cater to business meetings during the week. Closing on weekend forces guests to choose expensive breakfast buffet or go elsewhere. 6) Parking at hotel also extremely expensive - 34 Euros per night. However, the hotel was gracious enough to not charge us on checkout. An appreciated gesture, but should be included in room rate. 7) 27 Euros for 24hrs of internet access.

I don't know if it should be a 5 star, but definitely a 4.5. The staff was very accomodating as they kept offering their help. The lobby is very nice and spacious and there is parking right out in front. It sits on one of the canals, and I think you can take canal cruises from there (I couldn't tell if they were doing them, but there were a couple docked right outside the hotel). It is very close to 3 different tram lines so it makes it easy to get to the center. The rooms are spacious and well furnished. The rooms are rich in wood decour and the shower is great. It is pretty quiet so you shouldn't have a problem getting a good night's sleep. It is also in a very safe area, a rather upscale residential area (it actually kind of sticks out from the rest of the buildings around it). Now for some of the negatives: if you are looking to walk to only thing, the only thing that is really within walking distance is Vondel Park. You have to take a tram to everything, but you do therefore save something ($) than if this was in the city center. Another negative is that a person from the housekeeping staff came in about 10 minutes after we arrived to drop off another bath robe (I had a friend who was also staying there that happened to him and she came in when he was taking a shower - maybe we just had bad luck). Our room was also very hot when we got in, and we turned down the heat all the way before we left for the evening. When we got back (relatively late) turning down the heat didn't do a lot, but was bearable. We didn't contact the front desk because it was so late. I'm guessing that this isn't standard for all rooms. Here is my recommendation: stay here if the price is right for you, you don't care if you are not in walking distance, and you are looking for a nice hotel in amsterdam. Do not stay here if you are looking for an affordable hotel close to the old area of amsterdam.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIt's a Hilton\u201d", "Author": "Bazrat92", "ReviewID": "UR126187484", "Content": "Clean and comfortable hotel, very good restaurant.

I would recommend using the trams instead of a hop-on-hop off bus. The Hitlon has a map the lists all the sites and tram/metro routes.

They couldn't promise it, of course, until they knew for sure, at the last minute, but it all worked out in the end and it was the start of a great visit with them. If you are flying in, you take the train from Schiphol to station Zuid. Then, from Zuid, you take the #5 tram (and trust me, just plan on taking the tram everywhere and go get a GVB pass for unlimited use) and exit on Apollolaan. I think this is the most economical route to get there as the shuttle was 15Euros per person. It is a 1/4 mile down the road on the right, past the big turtle with the guy on top statue. The room was a nice size (king bed) and the bathroom was a decent size, giant by European standards. Your room key is key there. You have to use it to get anywhere in the elevators and if you have executive lounge access, you will need it enabled for that. The first day, we checked in early, showered and left for the remainder of the afternoon. If you can swing it, ask for a canal view room. We had it and it was fantastic to look out the window every day and see the canal, which is the heart of Amsterdam. When we returned, they left us a tart on our bed, which was a fantastic surprise that we would be treated to a few more times before the visit was over. We slept great an enjoyed the free wifi that comes with being a Hilton Gold member. Everyone on staff was great from the doormen to the housekeeping staff...I cannot think of a single experience where I did not have a positive feeling in talking with or dealing with this staff. As gold members, we were also given access to the Executive Lounge and it was well worth it. Each day, they do a very nice set up there with chicken skewers, pastry puffs (savory), chips, nuts, cheese, sodas, beer, wine, and a variety of alcohols for drinks. Another absolutely awesome perk to being a gold member is the fantastic buffet breakfast they do each day. We really enjoyed the selection and service every day. They also offer this for those willing to pay for it, as well. It is a good selection of scrambled and boiled eggs, bacon, sausage, hash brown potatoes, beans, toast, croissant, muffins, suikerwafels (which are my absolute new favorite thing in the world), pancakes, fruits, yogurt, oatmeal, cold cereal and cold cuts.

I had a lovely room on the top floor with a view of the canal. The executive lounge is a smaller glass room on the tenth floor it is the only space on that floor. It is a relatively diminutive size, however it is an elegant and well-run space. The breakfast was excellent for an exec. lounge breakfast. You expect it not to have everything that the full Hilton breakfast has however the quality was quite high. The view is great from the lounge. My room was very comfortable and was already made up without feathers as requested. It came with two robes and slippers, a kettle with tea, a fully stocked minibar, good wifi signal, a shower with a tub. The room was elegantly decorated with teak paneling in the entry way and bathroom and gold leaf wallpaper throughout the main room. It had a large painted crown moulding at the top of the ceiling. The curtains were maroon colored with large leaf print that matched the carpet in the hallway (although it was the inverse color scheme). The room was completely quiet I had no problems at all with noise. A turn down service at 5pm stocked the room with two large bottles of water for free. It turned out that my birthday was on the three days of my travel and, without requesting it, the hotel sent me a small birthday cake. It was a single serving cake with the hotel logo in marzipan on the top and marzipan sides instead of icing. A lovely treat after a long day of work. I did not dine in the Roberto's restaurant mainly because I typically wanted a lighter meal in the evenings. Instead I ate at the bar where I could order a salad. The food was good and came with several small loaves of good fresh bread more than I could eat really. The bar is great it is next to the canal with larger comfy lounge chairs it is quiet and a good place to have a quiet meal after a day of work. The entire hotel is nonsmoking which is unusual in Europe and great if you do not smoke. My only complaint is that housekeeping missed a few things they took one robe away and did not replace it. They also forgot to clean my teakettle one night and did not change my sheets on the third day. But these were relatively minor things compared to the overall excellent service at this nice hotel.

In my opinion, this was the perfect vacation because the Hilton Amsterdam was the perfect hotel. We rode the train from the airport (AMS) to Amsterdam Zuid Station. Then took the #5 tram to the Apollolaan stop which was a beautiful short walk to the hotel. Not only was it easy for a foreigner, it was cheap! We went to check in where the front staff was extremely nice and personable. They welcomed us as they gave us our room key and offered to answer any questions we may have had. Since we arrive very early in the morning, we opted to reserve a room for the evening before so we would be assured a room at check in. Since my husband is part of the Honors program and has quite alot of points, we were given an upgraded room but honestly, all of the rooms are very nice. We overlooked the marina which was pretty and quiet. The houses on the other side of the canal were beautiful to look at and the view below our room of the boats in the marina looked like a post card picture. The room is well equipped with all of the American amenities. It even had a scale and bath robes. The bathroom was modern and seemed to have an IKEA feel to it. The beds were perfect and you get a pillow menu to choose what you like best. For breakfast, we had the option of going to the 10th floor to the lounge for breakfast or eating in the nice restaurant which both were buffet style. Down stairs in the restaurant (Roberto's) there was a fireplace burning and it was quite cozy. The food in both locations was similar, there was just a bit more downstairs. There were lots of different kinds of cheeses and yogurts and the breads were so delicious. Eggs both scrambled and soft boiled with bacon and mini veal sausages. Perfect to have a big breakfast and then head out for a day of sightseeing. This hotel has the perfect location because we got the feel of being in a beautiful neighborhood very close to 3 tram stops to the city and yet far enough away from the hustle of the city. The ride was short into town yet it was a nice way to see more of the city than if we were staying in the city, which gets extremely crowded and loud the closer to the weekend you get.

We had no complaints whatsoever, the only thing I can mention was I had to chase the maid down to get some more toilet paper!

In light of this I found that the Hilton Amsterdam is severely over priced and the front desk staff snobby compared to other establishments. The front desk staff like speaking about guests in Dutch, thinking that they don't understand (I incidentally speak very good dutch, but kept myself \"dumb\"). I find this quite patronising and rude (to speak another language in front of the customer) and in poor taste. Also strangely, as a diamond member, I have never ever had the benefit of a room upgrade to the executive floor (4 stays and counting). That in itself is understandable, but what is frustrating is that the standard rooms have less amenities (such as the mineral water that was only replaced after two days!), whilst at the same time the executive lounge runs out of drinks during the day (mini-mini-bar fridge). The executive lounge is also, despite the magnificent view, uninspiring, with the same fare in snacks every day, with no variation. Strange is also that the fitness club is only open from 7am in the morning (I'm heading to work then already to beat the dutch traffic, which essentially renders the fitness club useless to me) and charges a 17.50\u00e2\u201a\u00ac fee as well (for non HH gold and diamond members). In addition I find the daily fee of 34\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for parking quite steep (Hilton The Hague has VALET parking at 20\u00e2\u201a\u00ac per day in comparison). On top of that the Hilton Amsterdam offers soaps for sale in the room as well as their cusions. Maybe an interesting idea, however it feels like I am permanentaly living in a \"let's-milk-this-customer-for-all-he-is-worth\" supermarket when at the Hilton Amsterdam. What tops it for me is that, despite the overly focus on making the most \u00e2\u201a\u00ac out of the customer (refer the shops in the lobby as well!), the iron is chained to the ironing board, as if I will pinch the iron. This results in turning your shirt-ironing-experience into an artful dance to untangle the chain and get all sides of your shirt crease-free. Maybe am a little harsh on the Hilton Amsterdam, but I do think I am comparing apples to apples (Hilton Amsterdam to Hilton The Hague, Hilton Rotterdam Hilton Schipol, and Hilton Brussels, none of which chains the iron to the board, tries peddling their cushions or extra soaps - with the most of expensive of the comparison group being 15% CHEAPER than the Hilton Amsterdam, etc) and that the Hilton Amsterdam comes out as a definite plum.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cHappy to return\u201d", "Author": "chashk", "ReviewID": "UR114953329", "Content": "The staff were friendly and generally helpful.

We were upgraded to a canal view room since this was our anniversary trip; they even provided complimentary champagne, fruit and an anniversary cake for us during our last day there. That's true exceptional service! Highly recommended for couples or families with children who wants to enjoy the natural beauty of Amsterdam, and yet not too far away from the \"action\" in the city.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201ccannot stay away from here\u201d", "Author": "TheWebsters", "ReviewID": "UR111272327", "Content": "my husband and I have stayed at this hotel for 15 years, Feb july and nov each year. the hotel is fantastic. all the staff are very professional. short tram ride into the centre of Amsterdam, the hotel is in a quiet area and not far from a big park and short walk to museumplein. nice quiet area. excellant hairdresser within hotel!!! cannot wait until July", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beirut", "Title": "\u201cVery good Hotel in an amazing location\u201d", "Author": "Soly20", "ReviewID": "UR109904273", "Content": "A step away from the craziness of Amsterdam city center, lies this quite comfortable hotel with amazing nature surroundings that automatically relaxes you as soon as you get to it.

There was plenty to choose from and all fresh from the kitchen. Our only problem was the automatically billing mini bar, as we needed to chill milk for our baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bottle. There is NO space for extra items and ended up being charged for several drinks which we moved to make space for the milk. These were kindly taken of when we checked out without any questions.

You will also be able to get a good night's sleep as you will be away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre. We took a tram to the hotel which took about 10 minutes. Once we stepped off the tram which stops mid way on a bridge, we walked over the bridge to Appollolaan and turned right. Turn left and you will eventually end up at the Wyndham hotel! There is a park area in the middle with a few statues and within about 5 minutes, as long as you have not been knocked down by passing cyclists you will come across the Bilderberg Garden Hotel, and when you cross the road, the Hilton is there. We checked in and my wife made a fuss as to how this break was a special occasion for her and that she wanted a good room. We were given the canal view rooms that I know are the ones to get. Within a few minutes of entering the hotel we were in our room. Its good sized room but you will find newer branded city hotels tend to have larger deluxe rooms. We had a big comfortable bed, loved the view of the canal and the city but the LCD tv was on the small size. The bathroom was again of a decent sized and the hotel provides you with Evelyn & Crabtree branded soap, shampoo etc. The hotel provides you with tea and coffee facilities. As we did not have breakfast included we got our croissants etc from the bakers shop the day before and ate them in the morning with our own tea or coffee and that kept us going until lunchtime. If you wish to purchase even continental breakfast from the hotel it will set you back a rather lot of Euros. The mini bar at the hotel is expensive; they charge over 5 Euros for a bottle of mineral water. If you step outside the hotel and turn right, walk towards the glass building situated next to the hotel and turn right again, you will again walk over a bridge and come to Emmastraat. There is another tram stop on your left there that will take you to the city. If you cross the road and walk a bit further up and you will find a general store where you can buy your own drinks, snacks etc and it will save you from paying the hotel prices. However bearing in mind that 5 star hotels in Amsterdam are expensive and this visit was a treat for my wife, we could not complain about the hotel with the price we paid.

The only downside is that as we went with our teenage kids, of course, they found the whole thing too boring and both seemed to come alive when we went into town, so if we were to come here again, we would not come with them or choose a hotel that is not so conservative.

You'll need a taxi or the tram to get you there. The tram is only a few blocks away so it's easy to navigate.

Our early check in was available and we were shown several rooms (I am Hilton HHonors Diamond) and we selected a junior suite (really just a slightly larger room) which was nice (great beds but odd and not very comfortable sitting area furniture) and had a very nice bathroom. The best thing about this Hilton is the restaurant - Roberto's. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet every morning (included) and ate dinner there on three nights. The food and service were both outstanding! This leads me to comment on the worst thing about the hotel - the location. The hotel is in a lovely residential area but it is a 15-20 minute taxi ride - about $20 US each way to Dam Square and there are really no good restaurants in the area. (We walked to the two recommended near-by restaurants which were mediocre and expensive) When you add $40 taxi fare to a dinner bill elsewhere it was easier and less expensive to eat at Roberto's and know we would be having a great dinner. In summary, the Amsterdam Hilton is very nice but not very convenient for tourists. We missed being able to walk out and enjoy the fun and atmosphere of a downtown and we spent a week \"secluded\" at the Hilton which is just too long a stay for this hotel.

The bathroom had all the amenities that would be expected of a Hilton, including a lighted magnification mirror and a decent hair dryer with adequate outlets in the bathroom (we found this isn't always the case in Europe).

We stayed in room 805. The room was nicely decorated and we had a nice panoramic view towards the canal and \u00c2\u00abVondelpark\u00c2\u00bb. All rooms are equipped with Wireless High Speed Internet, but not free of charge. The Executive Lounge, which is located on the top (10th) floor, features a beautiful panoramic view over Amsterdam. The opening hours are from 07:00 to 23:00 on weekdays. In weekends and Public holidays the opening hours are somewhat limited, from 07:30 to 12:00 and 17:00 to 22:00. Breakfast is served until 11:00. The lounge is quite small, with a max capacity of about 25-30 persons (6 tables with 3 chairs and 4 tables with 2 chairs plus two comfy sofas). In the lounge they serve alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, vodka, whiskey, gin, rum, cognac and bourbon) in the evening (until one hour before closing time). The lounge also provides international newpapers and magazines.

From this stop you can take tramline no 5 and 24. The routes are different but both tram 5 and 24 have final stops at the Central Station. We bought 48 hours tickets from the gift- and souvenirshop on the ground floor and paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 11,50 for one ticket.

The hotels also have bicycles thats provided free of charge. You can reserve bicycles either via the Executive Lounge Host (10th floor) or at the Consierge. The breakfast is served at Roberto`s restaurant (and in the lounge if you have access). Opening hours for breakfast is 07:00 to 11:00 every day. We really enjoyed the breakfast.

The deal included a 2 night stay in 2 x double rooms and 1 x King family room. On arriving at the hotel we were advised that the hotel was overbooked and that we were being transfered to the Holiday Inn at the Airport. The receptionist was unsympathetic and unapologetic about this change despite the fact that we had booked our room almost 3 months previous to our arrival. The receptionist tried to pursued us that the airport was close to the city centre! She seemed surprised at our refusal to be transfered to an inferior classed hotel located 20 minutes outside of the city centre! we asked to speak to the duty manager who confirmed that the hotel had been overbooked that morning by conference delegates . When I asked her if the hotel had sold our reserved rooms to the higher paying confernce delegates she did not deny this suggestion. To cut a long story short, we refused to move as they were unable to offer us rooms in a 5* hotel in the centre of Amsterdam. The hotel manager managed to 'find' us rooms in the overbooked hotel. we were further disappointed however at the accomodation provide for the King family room which we had booked for 3 people. The room consisted of 1 double bed and one roll out bed for the 3rd person. The room was cramped for 3 adults and definitely not what we expected of a 5* hotel. When we raised our concerns with the duty manager he stated that it was Hiltons policy to accomodate 3 adults staying in a family room with a roll out bed. He very arrogantly asked me 'if I would like the hotel to refurbish the room for us'? He also stated that the King Family room which we booked via Last Minute did not match the type of rooms which Hilton offered. Overall we were very disappointed by the attitude of the management staff whom we found to be arrogant, unhelpful and snooty. We left with the impression that they did not welcome guests who had reserved last minute deals.

For many years, I have been a loyal Hilton Honors VIP because they have great hotels, excellent service and offer wonderful perks, superiors to other hotel chains. For the mentioned reasons, I decided to cash in 80K HH points for 2 nights at Amsterdam Hilton. That is a lot of points! This was the first leg of 18 days European vacation in 5 different Hilton hotels and the most expensive HH points of all other hotels. From the AMS airport we took the train and the tram #5, which was fine, although the tram was crowded and with 2 mid size suitcases was difficult to get in and out without bumping anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legs. We arrived at 9 am at the hotel ready for a nap. The lady at the reception welcomed us and give us the good news: they have a room available. I email the hotel a few weeks prior, asking for a room with a view, if possible. mentioning that this was a special occasion, our 10th wedding anniversary. After the good news we got the bad news: because of my HH preferences profile, we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive any perks; meaning not a room upgrade or executive lounge privileges. I tried to explain that I spend with Hilton approximately 150 nights per year and never heard of such rule but she kept telling me that these are the hotel rules and she can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change them for me. We needed some sleep so we left for the room, a second floor small room, supposedly with canal view. As it turned out, being on the lower floor, the room has mostly view of the hotel roof rather than the water. After a few hours of sleep, I returned to the reception asking, a different lady this time, to clarify why I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to receive access to the executive lounge. She wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure but after a few minutes of confusion and asking around, she came back with the same reason. I told her that was ridiculous and I wanted to speak with a manager. She looked around, went back to her computer and after of few minutes decided that we can use the executive lounge which is really great for breakfast and refreshments. At night they have all kind of hot finger foods. I noticed many people eating there at night. We did not because we wanted to go out for some nice dinners, but someone could easily make a meal out of the food is around. There is also a computer with free Internet access available in the lounge, however, the connection is very slow and even downloading my email took long time. I never encounter any lines for food or tables as others complained in previous reports. The hotel is nice, comfortable and for the most part the staff is friendly, professional and helpful. The room we got appeared to be one of the smallest they have and for Europeans standards was ok, meaning you can walk around the bed and have 2 people standing around the room in the same time. I stayed in a few hotels in Paris and Rome where you could not do that. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location is not the best.

Our 'deluxe queen' room was spotlessly clean and comfortable and had lovely views over the river and Hilton's tiny private marina.

The hotel is near the Vondelpark and we enjoyed a picnic there on our anniversary. The hotel is very expensive for food and drinks (the mini bar prices are extortionate, as someone else has pointed out) but we had anticipated this and ate elsewhere (the Aran Irish bar serves a delicious and very reasonably-priced cooked breakfast as well as continental). This was our third trip to Amsterdam and was, undoubtedly, the best. It was worth the extra money to stay at this hotel and I would recommend it, even if you only sleep there, as we did.

We arrived from the Airport and took the train to Amsterdam Zuid and then took Tram #5 to Apollolaan. It was a very short ride and much cheaper than taking a taxi. You can buy a 24, 48 or 72 hour transportation pass at the tourist center at the airport. You can also buy strips of tickets good for use on the trams and buses in Amsterdam at the Hilton. I don't know how much they cost but I am certain buying in strips significantly discounts the cost of transportation. We didn't recognize the Hilton as a hotel at first. We thought it was perhaps a hospital! We didn't see the modern Hilton Logo and it wasn't until we realized that this building was indeed the Hilton that we noticed the structure did indeed say \"Hilton\" somewhere on top of the building. The Lobby was very nicely decorated and check-in was very easy. I asked for and was given a canal view room, albeit on the first floor. The room was large for European standards. We asked for one bed but the \"bed\" was really two beds pushed together. The furnishings were very nice and the bed linens were of a high quality. The bathroom was large with nice toiletries. The only complaint I had about the room was the high cost of the mini-bar. Unbelievable! A Coke was 7 euros (over $10 US)!!!! Now consider that it you walk outside the main entrance to the hotel and make a right and keep going up the street (Emmastraat. my spelling may be off) for a few blocks, you will come to a supermarket on the corner where you can purchase soda (warm) for .47 Euros. That's about 75 cents U.S. There were no ice machines at the Hilton so if you want ice while staying as a guest you have to call room service. If you are planning on using the internet during your stay - beware. It costs $42 a night. In this day in age where so many hotels offer free wireless, that seemed really expensive. Although the hotel is about 15 minutes to the center of town, you can take Tram #5 or #19 into town. If you walk out of the hotel, make a right and then your first right (Emmastraat or close to that name) you will find the tram. It is a very short walk. By the #5 tram was a few blocks with restaurants and near the #19 tram were several restaurants as well. We ate at a tapas restaurant near the #19 tram and it was moderately priced and tasty. Food in Amsterdam is high by US standards. I noticed that some delis did not have indoor tables but did have benches or tables outside where you could sit and eat. These delis were of course much less expensive than full service restaurants. If you are really on a budget you can always go into an Albert's supermarket and buy sandwiches, etc. Actually, the supermarket was a great place to buy inexpensive presents for the folks back home such as Dutch caramel cookies in attractive tins, chocolate, etc. If I were to return to Amsterdam and could get a good rate at the Hilton, I would have no hesitation about returning.

Having stayed in lots of Hiltons, even those I've not been happy in (as there's plenty out there that are not so nice), you can always rely on a fantastic breakfast. Perhaps I caught the Amsterdam Hilton on a bad day, as the breakfast was very poor. Plenty of choice, but you could only identify the bacon by its dental records (it was cremated!). The scrambled eggs could have been bounced off the wall. Basically most of the breakfast items hadn't been cooked well or left out too long.

We saw the reviews for this hotel on Trip Advisor and managed to get a good deal on lastminute.com. It was my partners 30th birthday so I emailed beforehand to see if we could get a room with a city view. Not only did we get this but we also arrived back on our first night to find champagne, strawberries and cake had been left in our room. A very nice touch I think and it really made our night. If you can get a room with a city view it is beautiful. The windows are huge so you have an amazing view out onto the canal in front of the hotel, the surrounding area and Amsterdam central in the distance. This is lovely in the evening too. The room was outstanding, it was immaculately clean and the bed was amazingly comfy. It even had a pillow menu, if you'd like a different pillow! We had tea and coffee on the garden terrace a few times. It is overpriced at 6 euros each but it's almost worth it for the surroundings, it's a great spot. The only real bad point about the hotel is the price of the mini bar (7 euros for a can of coke, hmmm!) and the price of the breakfast (27 euros for continental, 32 for an american breakfast). I rarely don't know how they can justify this price. We would have considered it as it was a special occasion if we could have had it in the rooftop executive lounge as it was supposed to have 'a jawdropping view' but we were told that this wasn't allowed as we weren't in an executive room and if we did want breakfast it would be in the standard restaurant downstairs. So there really was no way I could pay \u00c2\u00a325 for some special K, yoghurt, a couple of pastries and a coffee! I know most of these reviews comment on the location but I think it's made clear it's a little bit out of the centre. We loved the location, it was in a nice residential district and only 5 minutes walk to the park or to the tram stop. We walked back in the evening and felt perfectly safe so don't worry about that. The 5 tram will take you right into the centre and back until midnight. I think tram 16 will too. To get here from airport, just take the train from Schipol to 'Amsterdam Station Zuid', we got our tickets at the self service machines for about 5.20 euros for both of us. From here just follow the signs for the trams and jump on the 5 tram going to 'Centraal Station'. We bought a strippenkaart (you can then use these later on all the trams) in the AH supermarket at the airport but you can just pay on the tram. It's about 80 cents I think. You need to get off at 'Apolollaan' which is about 4 stops away. From there turn back, walk over the bridge and turn right and then right again through a residential area and its right in front of you. Someone told us it would be about 40 euros in a taxi so much cheaper! So overall a superb hotel and we would be hard pressed to stay anywhere else in Amsterdam now!

We chose all of our hotels based on reviews that we read on this website, so it is our duty to come online and at least write a short review. Tripadvisor was a Godsend, and we swear by it now. This hotel had everything advertised, and everything you would expect from a Hilton: a safe, complimentary tea and coffee, excellent toiletries, a very large room, new furnishings, a large television, a good sized bathroom, a large desk etc etc. The service was excellent, as you would expect, and the breakfast was a proper Hilton breakfast: lots of hot foods (eggs, sausages, pancakes etc.), as well as the usual breads, cheeses, fruits etc. Fill up here, and you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be hungry until mid-afternoon. The standard room that we stayed in for three nights was so comfortably large and well furnished, that you can thoroughly understand why John and Yoko slept in for peace. My wife and I were tempted to do just that actually! A pro, or con (depending on what you are after), is that the hotel is not in the city centre. It will be a trek and a half to walk to the flower market, or the main train station etc, but luckily there is the reliable tram system nearby, and it takes only fifteen minutes to get to the end of the line (the main train station). But how near is near? Expect a brisk seven minute walk, in fairly desolate, residential surroundings to the tram stop (a bit scary to walk back to the hotel after dark). Restaurants are also a 10-15 minute walk away, so be prepared to walk, buy on your way back, or to pay high prices in the hotel. Overall, I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to any traveller that does not mind taking public transport (or a cab) to the city centre. If you are after an extremely comfortable hotel, that comes at a steal of a deal (this was one of the cheapest hotels that we stayed at in any city, and keep in mind that we stayed in a few 3-stars on our trip), then this hotel is for you. An added bonus is that every time you see a Beatles documentary, or you are chatting with your mates about Lennon and the sleep in for peace comes up, you can just mention in passing that you stayed there too. \u00ef\ufffd\u0160", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, excellent staff\u201d", "Author": "sylvia_m0", "ReviewID": "UR26001511", "Content": "This hotel came up heavily discounted on Hotwire and it was well worth the money.

Taxi from the train station costs approx. 20 Euros. Tram tickets are not easy to find around town, but they told us that they available at the metro station. Once at the Hilton, the cost of internet access is simply outrageous. I paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac27 Euros per each day of my stay ($35/day). We also expected to have at least free internet (wireless) access in the executive lounge, but there was only one terminal available where we could only stand, with no chair or table. No printer either. The executive lounge is nice and cosy with a nice view of the town, but it is extremely small and crowded, especially for breakfast. Expect to be re-routed to the restaurant downstairs during busy breakfast hours. We had to change room late in the evening, because the TV in our room was not working at all. This problem could have been checked in advance. The size of the room and especially the size of TV was also rather small for the class the hotel, also given the fact that our room has been \"upgraded\" due to my Gold HHonour membership. We clearly seee that this hotel is quite old, but has been renovated several times. The selection of TV channels for an Int'l hotel in one of Europe's business capitals was rather poor, with and excessive number of Dutch stations, and a very poor choice of other European channels. For example, no programs in Italian or Spanish were available, and only one program in French. BBC was also not available, and the only Int'l channel in English was CNN. The main German, Austrian and Swiss channels were also missing. Last but not least, the air conditioning in the room is extremely noisy, especially at night. Both rooms we staid had the same problem. We solved this by switching it off in the middle of the night, and by opening the windows, only to be awakened several times by noise of people entering the hotel late past midnight, and at sharply at 7 AM by men and tools at work in the Hotel courtyard.

No complaints at all here but as another review says, this hotel is clearly aimed at the business community. We were on a \"deal\" where breakfast was not included. At 22 Euros for a croissant and a cuppa, aka a continental breakfast, we opted to step out and to take our breakfasts at nearby cafes. There are plenty of them in the surrounding streets, all within a five minute stroll. The cost of the internet was another joke! 22 Euros for 24 hours is nothing short of extortion! Once set up, this is practically all profit and I am sure that if they were to reduce prices to realistic levels, they would get far more business. We used the bar on the arrival evening but again, felt extremely uncomfortable by the prices charged although service was very good. In truth, the cost of all these ancillary services really made us feel like we were being ripped off. We do expect to pay a premium price for services in a top hotel, but these were simply eye-bulging! It is not pleasant to feel that you have to go to nearby cafes, restaurants, bars and internet cafes but this is what we decided to do rather than use the excellent facilities in the hotel itself.

I was so tired at the time I decided to just accept the room because the clerk was unsure as to when another room would become available. When I entered the room I noticed wall paper peeling off the walls, somewhat dirty carpet and just an overall dingy feel. I was so glad that I wasn't actually paying for this crap. I decided to check out the executive lounge and on my way up I met two guests who had checked in a few hours before. They were not hilton hhonors members and they booked their room on priceline. Surprisingly they were given a junior suite facing the canal. I complained to the front desk and was given a multitude of ludicrious excuses as to why I wasn't upgraded. I suspect the gentleman who checked me in had lied about which rooms were available. At this property as a Diamond member I was offered the worst available room instead of the best available room. On to the good part. The executive lounge was truly excellent. The breakfast consisted of eggs, meats, cereals, fruits, nuts and pastries. There were always drinks and snacks available all day. At night they served sushi, egg rolls, and french pastries. The staff was very attentive, always asking if I needed anything. All and all it made up for the crappy room. One other bad part to the hotel is the location. It's very far from the city centre and even farther from the central station. Besides the restaurant in the hotel there are no places to eat in the area. There are numerous trams about a block from the hotel but if you plan on walking to the sites, it's quite a hike.

We booked direct with the hotel. In hindsight perhaps we could have got a cheaper rate, although perhaps Easter is a premium time. Got a bit lost trying to find the hotel as we got off at the wrong tram stop. Once you are there though the hotel is a close walk (maybe 5 mins max) to two different tram lines which makes getting into the main area easy, and in the day time we mostly walked anyway (took about 30 mins to Ann Frank's). The area around the hotel is mostly residential. It is a bit quiet at night, although I felt safe walking back with my husband, and the fact that it is residential means that there are several 'local' bars and cafes nearby which were nice to spend time in. The reception is very airy and pleasant. As it was Easter there was loads of yummy mini easter eggs which were lovely! We were checked into our room efficiently. The corridors are a little bland. Our room was a twin so we telephoned reception and were upgraded to a junior suite as there were no other doubles left. The original room was clean but quite small and bland. The suite was larger with a lovely long couch. Both rooms overlooked one of the city's canals. Positives about the room: Extremely clean. The room was cleaned twice daily with toiletries replenished in the evening too when a token nightime chocolate was left on the bed. Bed was huge and very comfortable. The room was quite dark but there was a few lamps scattered about for 'ambience'. The toiletries were lush! All Crabtree & Evelyne La Source products. Two dressing gowns and slippers were provided. Shower was powerful and the bath a decent size. As I mentioned already, it was spotlessly clean which is important to me. We weren't sure if there was complimentary mineral water provided - some seemed to be chargeable so we left that alone. The mini bar was the usual pricey drinks/snacks. The hotel had fantastic tea! Rituals teabags - they come in silk pouches of different flavours and are the best! Have since bought a couple of packs back in London! The only negatives I can think of to mention about the room is the fact that it is a bit chain hotel bland, and the tv was in an odd position. You could watch it in bed, but it was facing away from the couch which rendered it a bit pointless....although Amsterdam is a great city with far better things to do than watch tv! The other negative about the hotel is the extortionate charge to use a gym adjacent to the building. Not worth it! My credit card did not swipe properly on check in so the hotel left a note in our room to ask to have this re-swiped. This was not a problem. The best thing, however, about the hotel was the fantastic buffet breakfast! It was by far the best range and quality of buffet food that we have had at a city hotel. The staff were lovely - think not many people order porridge as it seemed quite a surprise to them both days, but I would recommend! There was LOADS of fresh juices to help yourself to (kiwi juice anyone?!) and champagne on the sunday although we did not indulge. There was a large table full of fruit, cold meats, cheeses. An area full of breads and pastries. Lots of hot food: pancakes, sausages, eggs etc. A great omelette station where staff cooked infront of you. Suffice to say we were full for most of the day!

Finally we headed back to the hotel and the bar on the main floor opened. We ordered a small selection of dutch appetizers which gave us a nice flavor of dutch cuisine. They were very well prepared and almost worth the 20+ USD we paid for them. It was enough to stave off the hunger. Other than that, we did not dine at the hotel. We took the tram to central station and stopped at the tourist center. I discovered that the best deal for hotels etc is the HOLLAND PASS. You get admission to several attractions and discounts to many more for one price and you go at your own pace. We also picked up day passes for the trams. The staff was very polite, helpful and professional. The internet cafe was tricky to find but very nice with your first 30 minutes free and free printing. I would reccomend this hotel if you don't mind taking public transportation and walking about 3-5 minutes to the tram station.", "Date": "June 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, UK", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "scmk3000", "ReviewID": "UR16757459", "Content": "Hitlon Amsterdam is a nice hotel and staff did seem genuinely very friendly. Most staff smiled at us and were happy to help when we wanted to know the direction to town. We had a room overlooking the canal and could see the city centre afar. The room is clean and comfortable but I wouldn't say it oozed characters. Beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was clean and nice free toileteries refilled everyday(Crabtree & Evelyn available also to buy - at ridiculously high prices). The room is big for European city hotel standard, probably due to the location. It's true that it's quite far from the heart of things and certainly not a lot around the hotel - especially at night. No problem though, taxi (aplenty in the centre at night) was only about 15 euros so not too bad if you intend to stay out late. Did walk into town one day via the Musemsplein. There is a grill like restaurant (next to a hotel?) by the slopey museum building and they have some of the best club sandwiches ever! Enjoyed the slow relaxing walk so didn't keep the time. Most of the time we took the bus. The bus stop is a few mins walk. Just turn left coming out of the hotel and turn left again crossing the canal nearby. Turn yet another left on to the main road and continue for few mins and you will see the stop - bus 16 (quite frequent. The route for bus 24 is under construction so only 16 is available. The journey is about 10-15 mins as other said. I don't think the hotel has a pool but according to the broshures in the room, it has a jucuzzi in the health centre. Didn't use it so can't tell if it's good or not. Prices of the snacks and drinks were outrages, and the room service wasn't cheap either. Overall it's a nice 'event' hotel. Wouldn't say it's a true 5* - for american standard it's a 4*, for Far East standard it's a 3-4*ish. For leisure it's great for relaxing (my weekend break was kinda one) as it's in a quiet area but if you do enjoy your late night out then I would find a hotel in the centre - just for the convenience. Also great for museum visting as it's only 10 mins or so away from them.", "Date": "June 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel to enjoy Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "nuheart", "ReviewID": "UR16577624", "Content": "Had a terrific stay at the Hilton Amsterdam in April for two nights.

You can also walk to the Van Gogh museum and the Rijksmuseum The hotel food prices are outrageous so I recommend eating down the block at some nice places , unless you are on an expense account. A simple sandwich is at least 21 euros. However their outside terrace area is an outstanding place to gather and sip a drink overlooking the canal and wonderful landscaping.

I would recommend that you buy a 24, 48, 72 or 96 hour ticket which covers all trams, buses and the Metro and all zones. It is quite difficult to know when you are crossing zones so an All Zone ticket is much easier. If you are planning to visit the museums then the 24, 48 or 72 hour IAMSTERDAM card (which includes a transport ticket) is by far the best value. Tram to the museum district takes less than10 minutes and 15-20 minutes (depending on the time of day) to central station. The hotel was great but bar prices in the hotel were high, 5 Euros for a small beer and 13.5 Euros for a gin and tonic but having drinks sitting in the sun in the Garden Terrace was an experience not to be missed. There are a huge number of restaurants in Amsterdam but if you wanted to stay near the hotel turn left out of the entrance and turn right after about 200 yards down the first main street.

Bathroom was large and looked modern. No issues with the bathroom. Service: Inconsistent service. Checking in was a breeze. It took about 5 five minutes. The front desk person was very nice, friendly, and gracious. She asked if we would need a map or if we want her to escort us to our room. She also said if we need any other assistance, we should not hesitate to ask her. She really went out of her way. Checking out was another story, the gentleman who did the checkout for us was very abrupt, spoke very fast (in English) and allowed to be interrupted various times by his co-workers. This should not be a big deal if it was elsewhere. For a five star hotel, there was no refinement there. Downturn service offered upon request. Recommendation: Not recommended unless you are certain about the poor location and the inconsistent service.

Once you leave in the morning, it's too much of a pain to return before nighttime when you are ready for bed. It's a 20-25 minute tram ride just to Dam Square!

If room size is more important than location, this is a great place. The staff was very nice, and the rooms were wonderful. If only the location was better, it would be perfect. To me, it's just too far away. I think most people would be better off staying at one of the MANY affordable and nice hotels more central.

You would get greeted or asked how your day/afternoon/evening went, yet never felt like it was forced or heavy handed. Reception staff also functioned in the same professional and slick manner.

An airport shuttle can aslo be booked to/from the hotel should you not feel like facing the public transport system.

The hotel itself has a subdued atmosphere that is a welcome counterpoint to a day of sightseeing in the often frenetic streets of Amsterdam. The hotel interior is tastefully elegant and updated. The central feature of the lobby is the inviting panoramic window wall opposite the front entrance that invites you for a cocktail on the canal-side terrace, overlooking the Hilton Marina (exhorbitant prices notwithstanding). The terrace is worth the \"price of admission\" if just to relax as the afternoon winds down. The rooms were nicely furnished, of reasonable size. The beds, really comfortable, and the pillow and soap menus, a nice touch. We had two rooms, a canal view and a \"boulevard\" view...get the canal view if you can. It's a wonderful treat that gets you in the mood for sightseeing in the city. I've read many negative views of the exterior architecture. Yes, the building looks a bit anachronistic and a little out-of-place in its early-60's design, but if you really look at it, it is a very clean design that hearkens back to an era full of potential and possibility. The building's architect, Hugh Aart Maaskant, is actually of some renown, and staying in the hotel a few days will allow you to appreciate its functionality and beauty. We were upgraded to an executive room, as Diamond members. Their top-floor lounge is really a glass-walled penthouse that affords fabulous views on three sides of Amsterdam. Both the breakfast and the cocktail hour food selections were well-stocked. The evening bar was stocked with all standard liquors, mixers and beers. The wine selection included free-flowing, very tasty, italian sparkling wine (very dry, which I like). My 19 year-old son developed a taste for champagne while there! The only down-side of the lounge is it is closed in the afternoons. Also, the attendants, though very accommodating and responsive, are not the concieriege, so you can't rely on them for ticket purchases or a wealth of local recommendations; however the concierge downstairs was very helpful on that score. (Get museum tickets from them to avoid lines). The health club is connected and privately owned. Gold/Diamond members get free access, though. Good equipment, unisex spa facilities. As for location, yes the hotel is not at city center, or, really even a comfortable walking distance, but the tram service is so good, who cares? And I actually enjoy using public transportation like that, as it puts you in closer touch with the local community. Three tram lines are close-by and get you to essential parts of the city: 16, 2 and 5. Beethovenstraat--a shopping area--is just a short walk away from the hotel. I'd suggest a walk down this street to get a glimpse of a less-touristy side of Amsterdam. There's a cafe--Fidelieo--2 or 3 blocks south of Apollolaan, on Bethovenstraat, that serves excellent food, has an outdoor cafe, and is open late (the only eating place neaby--includng the hotel--that I found open past 11 pm). Some local recommendations: --Van Gogh Museum is excellent, but get tickets in advance. --Ann Frank House is a must. I went 30 minutes before opening and there were maybe 40 people in front of me...got in within 5 minutes of opening. Later in day, lines are crazy. --The Holland Casino is fun if you want to try a bit of gambling. Look fo local \"tourist\" magazines or brochures for free admittance coupons...otherwise you'll pay 3.50 euros to enter. Bring your passport too (drivers license does not work!). --Go to a pancake house and get pancakes and/or waffels. We tried De Carrousel across the canal from the Heineken Brewery, and were very pleased. --Enjoy the street performances on the Leidseplein and other areas (don't forget to tip), and then for shopping/souvineirs, walk from Leidseplein to Klaverstraat to Dam Square. You can make a detour to the Red Light District, if that's on your to-do list. --See Boom Chicago comedy club. Its very much reminiscent off Second City in Chicago, and--I though--the comedy was actually a little better.

The whole hotel is very well kept and really clean, a refreshing change to the rest of the city. We were given a room on a high floor with twin beds. As with many hotels twin rooms are two single beds in close proximity. They do however push apart and offer a good level of comfort with beautiful white duvets. There was a pillow menu and extra pillows already in the closet. For all you tea and coffee drinkers there is a kettle but sadly for me no biscuits. The bathroom was small, clean and functional. No sign of the Hilton 'mist-free' mirrors here though. The shower held its temperature well and the pressure was perfect. There was a soap menu but as in most hotels this was an extra charge. A typical Hilton selection of La Source shower gel, shampoo, body cream and shoe shine were provided. All great quality.

The location is more in the middle of a neighborhood where people actually live, which makes it quieter and more filled with trees and greenery. The little shopping area about 5 minutes away is filled with trendy shops that appear to be frequented by people that actually live in Amsterdam, not tourists.

The hotel is approximately 2 miles from the city center, but I enjoy walking and so I felt that it was not very far from the action of the city center. Amsterdam is also a very easy city to bike across, and the hotel offers free bike rentals. Unless, you are unwilling to bike or walk more than a few blocks, I do not think that the hotel is too far from the center of Amsterdam. There are upscale shops and restaurants immediately nearby and also a few blocks away in the trendy De Pijp neighborhood. Additionally, the hotel is located right near Vondel Park, which is an amazing place for enjoying nature and relaxing with locals. This was the best part of the hotel for me. Vondel Park has many small ponds and open areas where people come with blankets, beer, and snacks to soak up the sun with their friends. If you have children, the park may be an excellent resource for you. I saw scores of strollers in the park, and there is a small playground and sports complex for the little ones. As a related note, on Queen's Day, the park is reserved exclusively for children to sell their wares and perform dances and songs for spare euros. It is also one of the few places that is appropriate for children during that holiday (as the rest of city was filled with drunk revelers). Near Vondel Park is the film museum and an excellent coffee shop named Tweedy's. The hotel itself is clean and nicely kept. It is located right on a canal, so you can arrange for a boat ride to pick you up at the hotel. The concierge was very helpful and can provide a number of different maps of the city, depending on your interests. The only drawback of the hotel was the prices for food and internet service. They charge a fortune for the amenities, but they also tend to cater to business people with expense accounts. A carefully guarded wallet can help avoid unnecessary expenses.

The hotel staff that we came in contact with were all so nice, especially the man and woman that were the breakfast hosts in the restaurant. Room service dinner from the Italian restaurant was excellent. It was truly fine Italian cuisine with a wonderful presentation. This hotel is located about 15 minutes from the airport. Basically in between the airport and the city center. Due to some major road construction, they have to detour quite a bit. The hotel lets guests know that these detours are legitimate and not due to unscrupulous cab drivers. This was our first time in Amsterdam and we loved it. Would I stay at the Amsterdam Hilton again?

However, the friendliness and superb executive lounge make this a great hotel choice. This beautiful tree-lined neighborhood is great - soothing and serene! My nicest canal photo was right behind the hotel and walks to the tram stop were so peaceful! The rooms are OK - orange & red is a strange color for hotel decor, but the beds are comfortable with crisp white down duvets and great views (even on the non-canal side). The executive lounge is fantastic - including hot breakfast entrees, a killer 360 degree view and a great staff. The evening canapes and desserts were great and access to the lounge made a huge difference in the quality of our stay. As per previous reviews, the trams will easily get you where you need to be and the hotel is ideal for those who will spend a few days at the nearby museums. The canal boat tour starts right behind the Rijks museum so this also got us around Amsterdam in addition to the trams. I usually prefer to stay close to city center, but loved the area of this hotel - Roberto's (hotel restaurant) is good and the hotel next door had a fantastic innovative restaurant with lots of well-heeled locals and it was easy to catch a tram to Leidesplein for dinner.

This is also the walking route to the Rijksmuseum and Museumplein and the Concertgebouw. Although the hotel is a long way out of town, it is around 20 minutes in the rush hour to the Centraal Station on the tram. Come out of the hotel and turn left then second left at the major junction to the bridge and you will find the stop for the numbers 5 and 24 trams. Both of them go to the town centre although the number 5 is the nicer route. The fare is EUR 1,60 each way and is much better than getting a taxi. From the airport, there is a hotel shuttle service costing EUR 12,00 each way which will drop you at the hotel you are staying at. This is to be found on Schipol Plaza and is very convenient.
