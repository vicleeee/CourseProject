Reception staff are pleasant and well informed. There is a free computer in the tiny reception area and free wifi elsewhere. But.... The rooms, whilst tolerably clean, are rather worn and in need of a re-fit. Bedclothes are far from new. The TV only had four channels working, all international cable news rather than domestic and most of those intermittently. The breakfast room is a joke, the kind of thing you might expect in a youth hostel and the replenishment of supplies could not keep pace with demand. I took my meagre fare to the adjacent reception area to find a place to sit down. I found the neighbourhood quite entertaining (and for certain you will not be ripped off in shops or restaurants), but many will find it drab, not the kind of place that they would associate with a holiday. On balance: It is a cheaper option, but it could be so much better within the resources available.

The service is courteous, internet use is free and breakfast is modest yet, I think, adequate. The next room was very noisy on the first night but the remaining three nights were quiet. In fact the whole place struck me as remarkably quiet, even lonely - but I did go there out of season (despite 30-degree heat in Madrid!). My sole objection is to the location. The Calle de Canillas is all right and handy for the airport and also the bus station at Avenida de Am\u00e9rica (for visits to Cervantes's birthplace, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares). There is even an attractive-looking garden suburb in another part of the area. However, despite the name Prosperidad, the streets near the hotel are neglected and quite gloomy (hardly likely to improve in this economic climate). I found them pretty depressing.

We made our way to the building and found the room was on the ground floor overlooking a narrow busy street and the buildings opposite. Straight away we asked for a higher floor and the hotelier looked at us like we were stupid, so we had to make do with that. We noticed that the curtains were flimsy and see through and didnt close properly and that the shower head holder was broken so we either had to hold the shower head in our hands or take a bath, with a plug that would not fit. It was meant to be an aparthotel and although there was a small kichenette, there were no utensils whatsover, not even to make a tea/coffee. We went back to reception to mention the shower head, at which the hotelier just shrugged his shoulders. We also asked for a couple of cups and a kettle or a pan to make a hot drink and we were just told \"no cups, you'll have to use the glasses\", even though we knew they had plenty of cups in the dining room (if you can call it that). We were then told we could hire a box of utensils for a deposit of 20 euros, which contained a few pans and plastics utensils. So we purcashed a box only to find that there was nothing in there worth using. The next day we decided to stay in our room with the \"do not disturb\" sign put on the door, but the cleaners still just entered the room with a key 'in pairs,' to clean a room which was so small. The dining room was like a sardine can and the breakfast was limited. We were expecting American buffet breakfast, as stated. It seemed that whatever we asked for, they just werent interested and were very unhelpful. It's a good job we were only there for a few days. On our departure, we returned the box and the room key back to reception expecting to get our 20 euros back as we were told, only to be told that he had no money for us for the box we hired, and knew nothing about the 20 euros that we paid. As our taxi had not yet arrived, we tried talking with him about it but he just kept saying \"No\". In the end we had to leave without the money, which was not a great deal of money but it was just the principle of the whole thing.

It blocked both light and sound, so I got a really good sleep, despite the fact that the mattress was a bit lumpy.

It's only a few short blocks from the Prosperidad metro station, so we got to the center of Madrid in 10 or 15 minutes. The neighborhood is modest but interesting, with plenty of restaurants, pubs, etc. We ate well there!

Unfortunately the kitchen had been \"retired\" (i.e. no utensils, plates, cooking gear or kitchen table) and there was no work desk: just a round glass table with 2 uncomfortable chairs. When we asked about the kitchen we were shown an alternative room on the ground floor which was dark and depressing, and when we asked about whether any rooms had a work desk we were told \"no\". So we concluded that this was not really what it pretended to be (an aparthotel) and so made do but would never return. The good news was that our room was at the back and very quiet. There were other, more minor, complaints (like being given only one small bar of soap for the entire 12 days, combined with an obvious reluctance to provide more shampoo/gel - we used our own), but I think I have said enough. For guests staying off-season for 12 nights they should have made more of an effort for us.

The elevator was tiny as well, we are 2 tiny girls with 2 big and 2 small luggage and we barely fit! Rooms...very outdated with Thai decor?? It did have a kitchenette, which we did not use. The rooms also do NOT have A/C but it did have a heater so we had to leave the windows open for fresh air. We got 2 twin beds, which were okay as far as comfort. View is non-existent. Be careful when you walk the streets outside the \"hotel\" since they were littered with garbage and dog poop. Lots of cute dogs but people didn't seem to care or clean up after thier dogs. We did not feel threatened to walk outdoors, being 2 females, but we did turn in early (before 10pm) the 3 nights we were there. Bathroom - clean but be careful of the shower head. It is a hand-held shower head and the shower curtain was smaller than the whole tub. It's so easy to get the floor wet since the shower head did not have anything to hang it on and since the curtain was short, whatever's exposed will get wet. The walls were very thin and I heard everything our neighbors next door or upstairs did. Our last night there (Fri), we had to get up at 4:45am and good thing we did because at 5am, a couple of drunk men tipped all the garbage cans over and intentionally scraped the walls outside the buildings so to wake everyone up in the neighborhood. The complimentary breakfast was okay...consisted of pastries, some cold cuts, breads, coffe, tea, and juice. Distance to Puerta del Sol was probably less than 10 minutes or more, depending on the traffic. It costs less than 10 euros one way. There were some shops located within a short distance. Do not forget to check out the \"churreria\" where they served churros and hot, thick chocolate. There are a lot of bars/restaurants also nearby.
