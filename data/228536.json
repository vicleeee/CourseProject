I travelled to MADRID 3 to 4 times a year and spent about one month in all per year. The owners have decided to sell the Hotel instead of investing for necessary upgrades regarding current regulations. It will be transformed into Apartments. For those of you who knew this Hotel ( Hemingway stayed here when he came to the Bullfights and to the Circulo de Bellas Artes in the 1950's ) you will understand if I say this Hotel had a wonderful location for a good price. Clients of the Hotel were asked to leave about two weeks ago. I had reservations for 11 days starting June 1st. My thoughts go to my friends from the Hotel Staff who are out of a job, Gracia, Daniel, Juan Pablo, Paco, Antonio. I will miss you.", "Date": "May 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGood location, tiny rooms for the price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3529138", "Content": "We booked via Octopustravel and spent 4 nights in this Hotel. The staff was very kind and the lodge with the bar was really nice. Unfortunately the rooms were disappointing if compared with the price we paid: a bit small and not that nice looking we saw in the site pictures. Breakfast was good and the location was excellent: close to the Banco De Espana underground station, the Prado and Sol. A few minutes walk and you get everywhere in Madrid. Everything with Suecia is good except for the price you pay compared to the room you get.

From my experience, it seems like management got the message. Their website hotelsuecia shows their slogan 'we just want to be the nicest' which I'm guessing is in response to a reputation of being rude. This is the only explanation I can thing of, because I have to say that the staff was not only not rude, they bent over backwards to help me. I've loved the experience here. The location is awesome. My only (minor) issue is that you have to pay for wireless access, and it can be a bit flaky. I'm working with someone at a different hotel, and they said theirs was worse. Plus I've had the same issue w/some hotels in the states.I'm writing this review from the hotel using the wireless access now-- I'm on the 3rd floor, and the signal's a bit weak from my room, so I've had to work in the hallway. They have an outlet and tables in the hall, though, so it's only a minor incovenience. Getting back to the staff, they were extremely friendly and helpful. They let me check in early after a long flight from the States. The maids greeted me when I arrived. The staff lent me a transformer for my laptop. They outsource their wireless support-- when it was down, they had me speak to whoever does their support (the staff and the support speak Spanish and English), but I was eventually up and running, and they were very helpful. I'd be curious what other more recent travelers think, but to me the staff has not been rude at all -- on the contrary, very impressive. I think they've changed their tune", "Date": "May 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cA Disappointment\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3183718", "Content": "Spent three nights at this Hotel in late Jan '05. The Suecia is in a good location with a fairly good restaurant.. Our room on the 9th floor although , of good size, & clean was badly in need of a refurbishing. Stains on carpet, soiled walls, cigarette burn on bed-spread and worn ,water strained desk all needed attention. Biggest complaint of all was the rudest, most impatience, Reception Desk staff-person I have ever encountered in my 55+ years of travel. At check-in I literally had to stand there and demand his attention to receive some service!!!!!. If I would have not have had an appointment scheduled in less than an hour I would have very quickly found another hotel.. Overall our stay here was O.K. and the Hotel is not that bad, but I will stay elsewhere when next visiting Madrid. .", "Date": "February 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cGood Value\u201d", "Author": "carcinoid", "ReviewID": "UR2287496", "Content": "Good central location for walking almost anywhere to see sites.

All of the rooms are quiet with 50s/60s decor. (A few of the rooms are as dark as the vault of a Swiss bank, although they are comfortably large.) Non-smoking rooms and extra long beds are available. The staff is unfailingly friendly and helpful with maps, restaurant reservations and hailing cabs. Breakfast is varied, fresh and generous.
