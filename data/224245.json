I'm rarely disppointed in one of their properites, but the Hampton Inn Miami Airport-West simply wasn't up to par with most Hampton properties. Check-in was painless, and the gentleman behind the counter was exceptionally friendly, greeted me as a Gold member, and even presented me with a nice welcome gift for being a gold member. After I got off the elevator, my first impression was the amount of carryout menus strewn down the hallway. As I opened the door, I nearly slipped on the menus shoved under my door. It's one thing if there are menus on the desk supplied by the hotel, but menus shoved under the door basically say that the hotel has a security issue. The room is standard Hampton fare, with a flat-screen TV, Cloud 9 bed, desk, micro/fridge, and chair. The bathroom was spacious and appeared to be updated recently. My biggest complaints had to do with lax housekeeping and general maintenance of the building: the showerhead was encrusted in mildew, there were water stains on the ceiling directly above the bed, and the carpet felt almost greasy. On top of that, the A/C unit was really loud and clicked on and off incessantly all night long. Net, this Hampton was priced lower than the others in Miami, and there's probably a reason for that. I honestly can't believe I blew 25,000 of my HHonors points on such a sub-par experience.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "MA", "Title": "\u201cOK, but please fix the air conditioner!\u201d", "Author": "jah1954", "ReviewID": "UR126351906", "Content": "We stayed here due to location and price.

I was traveling on business. My 11 year old daughter was traveling with me on this trip. So we landed in Miami and picked up a rental car, I called the hotel for direction from the Airport I was shuffeled around to 3 people no one could give me directions. I followed the directons the last person gave us we got lost for over 2 hours. Come to find out the Hotel is about 2 miles from the airport. Well we arrive at the hotel around 7pm the hotel appered nice and the staff was nice. We went up to the 2nd floor my 11 year old took the keys and walked ahead of me to open the room. To my suprise they gave us keys and checked us into an occupied room. My 11 year old daughter walked in on a couple doing there thing ( if you can read what I am saying ). I returned to the front desk rather upset they did change us to a new room. The only other problem we had is on Saturday I went to the front desk to extend our stay till Monday due to problems with our flight on Sunday. The front desk girl said it was taken care of and redone our keys. On Sunday about 1:15pm the housekeeper asked what time we were leaving I replied we are not we are staying till tomorrow. She said no your suppose to be checking out today by 1pm. I went to the front desk and a woman named Maria was working I told her how I had extened the stay the night before, she said no you are suppose to leave today and we are sold out so you have to leave. I replied this is not right can you please call the Manager. She said No she is off today and I am in charge and you have to leave. You have 10 min to vacate the room or you will be charged for another night. So we left and we were fourtunate the airline took care of us. When I got home that evening I called and spoke to the same girl that extened my stay on Sat, she said it was extended and she didnt know what happened and was so sorry. So I called the Hotel GM Angie the next morning she apoligized and said she didnt know what Marias problem was that she should have called her. She said Maria only works weekends. Angie did refund me for the entire stay so she did do what was right. I am a Hilton Honor Gold Member and I appricate what Angie done to take care of the situation. All in all the stay was ok.

Especially with all of the good things about this place, I just cannot recommend staying here. Always best to start with the good so lets start with the good: Shuttle service from the airport was great, call them up they were there in 15 minutes. They will also shuttle you to area restaurants at no charge. Hotel area is nice, we actually chose to walk to one of the restuarants in the area which was about a 20 minute walk. They also offer shuttle service to the cruise port for a reasonable fee. Front desk was very accommodating. Our intial room (we booked off of hotwire) they had put us in had a full size bed. We went down to the desk, requested a bigger bed and they put us in a room with a king size bed no problem. Room was very clean, nice big flat screen tv, nice size bathroom. The place offered free popcorn at night, and breakfast was better than average offering waffles, ham, bisquits and gravey in addition to your standard bagels and cereal. We purchased the shuttle service to the cruise port, and the shuttle was 30 minutes late and they refunded our fare for having to wait so long (we didn't even request it be returned nor did we complain it was late!). Very nice! So the big question is why wouldn't I stay here again. Well the answer it the bed! The bed comfort was horrible. Pillows had no fluff, bed was hard, just tossed and turned all night long and on top of that the air conditioner made this annoying clickety click sound all night long. We did not get a good night sleep to say the least. So this review is really bizzare, the hotel had so many really good things about it. It is just a shame the bed that was just so gosh darn awful.

Good location for the airport and actually, very good location for last minute shopping, the Dolphin Mall and other malls are really nearby so if you have a car, this is place to stay. What let's the hotel down, is quite frankly, the state that the hotel is in. It is clearly used as a stopover for business people to meet and greet each other, or people like us, a stopover before flying home. The rooms stank with just general wear and tear, the carpets, walls etc were really dirty and it's a shame really.

Even worst than the most disgusting hostels that I experienced while travelling in Europe in my early 20s. We booked this suite in the summer and assumed that we booked enough ahead of time to receive a reasonably good room. We arrived at the Hampton Inn in the evening of December 3rd and ended up sitting down in the main lounge/tv area for 20 minutes as there was no staff on site for that long. We were finally able to check in and we went straight to our room. The moment we walked into our room, we were blasted with the smell of very recent cigarette smoke and cheap perfume and the room was filled with grey smoke. It hit us like a punch in the face and we were immediately coughing and hacking. My lung aren't great, so I had to go sit out in the main hallway to recovery while my husband went down to the lobby to ask for a different room. Without any exaggeration, it smelt like the hotel room had just finished being rented out by the hour and someone had gone in 30 minutes before we arrived and sprayed a whole bottle of perfume to try and hide the smoke smell (and other odors). It was overpowering! My husband soon learned that the hotel was full but the night manager apologized and said that we could probably get a refund if we talked to the day manager the next morning. The night manager seemed very embarrassed and wasn't at all surprised that we had complained - he was expecting it. My husband returned to the room and we just decided to go to bed and try to get some sleep. The problem was that this room only had a double bed and my husband is a very large man (220 pounds, into body building, you get the picture). He ended up letting me sleep on the bed and he slept next to me on the floor. I ended up having to open a whole bunch of coffee bean bags and have them laying around my face so that it would mask the dizzying perfume and smoke smell. We had a horrible sleep and in the morning went down to speak to the manager. As we were waiting for her, we noticed the plaque on the wall that stated that if their customers aren't 100% satisfied, their money would be refunded. They should really take that plaque down. We explained what had happened to the manager and she immediately stated that since we had purchased the hotel through Hotwire, there was nothing that could be done. We mentioned the 100% satisfaction guarantee, and she said that that only applied to their own customers and Hotwire customers were not offered the same standard. We were absolutely shocked by this. If Hotwire customers are not held to the same level of their other customers, they really should not be offering their hotels on Hotwire. The Hampton Inn manager was very abrupt and rude and took very little care in the fact that we had obviously just experienced the worst hotel night of our lives. She just couldn't wait to have us leave and absolutely looked down at us because we had purchased through Hotwire. In addition to this information, I can confirm that all other negative reports listed here on tripadvisor are absolutely true. This hotel is dirty, both in the lobby area as well as in the room.

When we walked into our room the stench was worse and there was a puddle of water on the floor around the air conditioner that extended past the desk.

The front staff were also apologetic and assured me I would enjoy their comfortable beds. Unfortunately around 1:30 pm as I was trying to rest, drilling started. Yes they are undergoing rennovations! - a fact not mentioned on their website.

We were allocated a room on level 4 - non smoking. The beds and pillows were clean and quite comfortable. The bedroom furniture was a bit tired looking as was the bathroom - but for the money it was OK - have been in pricier hotels that have not been as clean! The only main problem we encountered was the air conditioning unit being quite noisy. Previous hotels have had the modern units encased in the ceiling or wall and are very quiet in their operation - this was one was placed on the floor underneath the window and sounded very much like a diesel engine 'ticking over' until you turned it up and then it sounded like a diesel engine about to blow a gasket - also it was not very productive in keeping the room cool. Didn't bother with the inhouse food service [stops at 9.30pm I think] but ordered in, using a name we are familiar with in England, PIZZAHUT, they have the number on reception as it was not listed in the room brochure. It arrived direct to the door and was tasty and HOT! We took advantage of the inclusive breakfast, although the hot offerings didn't look to appetising the pastries were tasty and they had bagels, muffins, bread [with a toaster if you needed it] along with fruit, cereals and juices. Also I have to say that this was probably the best cup of tea I got whilst in USA! Free shuttle - if using to be collected from the airport you need to keep your eyes open and 'wave' it down - we were told to wait outside by American Airlines this we did........ but at the beginning of the terminals [A] when really we should have been further along the path nearer to terminal [C]. Had we been told this when we phoned in, it might have saved some time. Free shuttle - if using to leave the hotel, it leaves on the hour.
