Having stayed at other High Tech hotels, we had a reasonable idea of what to expect, and the hotel lived up to the expected standard. The hotel itself (as others have commented) is a little out of central Madrid. We did not find this a problem, as the hotel is within 2 minutes (300 feet/100 metres) of a Metro Station. With the clean, safe, cheap, and frequent Metro, you can get to any of the major sights within 10 to 20 minutes. If you don't want to travel into the centre after a long days sightseeing, there is a restaurant in the hotel, or a good choice of places within easy walking distance, There is also a good choice of shops, banks etc locally. The rooms are a good size, and come equipped (even at basic/standard level) with a large screen TV, laptop PC, and large bathroom (with a good selection of toiletories). The aircon is controllable or you can open a window. Everywhere in the hotel is kept clean. Be aware that the bads are very 'firm'. Staff at the hotel are very helpful and locked our bags away on our last day - we had a late flight home, and did not want to drag our bags around all day. All the staff we met had at least basic English - reassurring if your Spanish is a bit rusty as people in Madrid seem to speak really fast! Overall, I would recommend this hotel. Don't expect luxury, or to be in the very middle of town.

I stayed in a double room with an elderly (my grandmother). For a background, I could consider myself a frequent traveler around Europe and have quiet an experience to compare one hotel with another. High Tech Arturo Soria would certainly be one of the best hotel Ive been in terms of good balance of money and quality. The room looks new, clean and modern. I was surprised that the room has a laptop and at least 32 inch LCD TV with full cable tv access. Another surprise was the shower which has a hydro massage shower... although It didnt work as I thought it would. There wasnt really a view from the room since our room was facing a brick walled building -- but this didnt concern us very much. The staff speaks enough English to accomodate most of your needs although I didnt ask them about any guidance in exploring Madrid. Now time for the not so pleasant aspect about this Hotel. First, the check-in was long. The receptionist took around 15 minutes just to get me a room which I pre booked in advance via Hotels.ca. She showed a relief with saying 'Finally!'. I was puzzled since they already charged full on my credit card and I already called them to secure my room with a credit card -- I cant imagine if they were not able to find me a room. Another let down is the fact that it does not have a bathtub, a kettle to boil water and that the bed quality could have been improved. The hotel location is very close to Metro Ciudad Lineal maybe less than 10 minutes walk. If you are heading straight to the city, you dont need to change line at all. The hotel is also reasonably close to the airport. It took around less than 15 minutes to travel with Car but with Metro it took around 40 minutes since you need to change train 3 times. With what I paid for (62euro per night) I think this Hotel is a rare find. Most hostels cost around 10 euro cheaper but you got massive drop in terms of quality. There are certainly other hotels at similar quality costing you 60 euro but I found all of them located in depressingly remote location. I suggest you to look no further if you dont mind the hotels to be outside a city little bit, but smackingly close to metro.

The holiday was booked the night before using Lastminute and the flight was the Spanish CometAir. We had not used this airline before and it proved to be a fast and efficient service. They gave out free drinks and nuts or biscuits, and sweets. We came through Madrid Barajas International Airport, and used the Metro to get to the hotel. To save changing trains four times we got off at Arturo Soria Metro station and walked about the 1 mile down the main road towards the Hotel. It surprised me as to how peaceful the walk in the sunshine was down the wide tree lined path next to the main road. After getting to know the Metro system we should have gone straight to the nearest Metro station, Cludad Lineal, as it is a two minute walk to the hotel from there. The Metro is bright, clean, safe, and the maps are easy to follow. We purchased a 10 journey ticket at 6.40 Euros from the dispensing machine at the Airport station entrance, and validated it for two people. When the first person goes through the barrier it is passed back to the second person to use. However, there is a 1 Euro surcharge to be paid to get into the Metro system at the Airport, and very annoyingly on our return home, a 1 Euro surcharge to leave the Metro system at the airport. People having to pay the 1 Euro fee to leave the Metro system at the airport was causing much commotion amongst travellers who were not expecting to pay a fee to leave the Metro system. It takes 18 minutes to get to the centre of Madrid, Callao, from the hotel by Metro, and there are no changes necessary, so the journey is very easy to do. The hotel is located in a very quiet residential area. In many places at home in the UK the yobs come out in the evening and hang about on the street. However, around the hotel it was the opposite, older folk come out in the evening and sit on chairs and chat way, playing cards, etc. It all leads to the feeling of a safe environment. The hotel is small, about 40 rooms, very clean and tidy, our room 204, being at the back of the hotel was so very quiet. In fact there was no noise of any sort to be heard while in the room. The air con was very efficient and the windows open if you want to have fresh air. The room had a queen sized bed which was very comfortable, telephone, flat screen TV, the only English channel was CNN News, free safe deposit box that works off your credit or debit card magnetic information strip, a mini bar. A down side was the lack of in room tea and coffee, although it could be ordered as room service. The toilet room was fitted with a body hydro shower unit, one of those that has about ten water jets that can be tuned on or off along the length of your body. A hair dryer, a good range of complimentary toiletries, the stylish modern glass and stainless steel sink unit does not have a plug \u2013 so bring your own. It is much nicer to wash from a basin of water in stead of running water, also it is more efficient as not so much water is used. The help yourself unlimited breakfast was enough to give us a good start to the day offering all the usual foods and drinks. The breakfast area looked small but worked well and we felt comfortable. There is free internet access via hotel PC\u2019s or wireless on your own laptop. On the relaxing terrace bar which is at the front of the hotel, do try the refreshing sangria at about 6 Euros for two people that comes with olives and crisps. It is a very refreshing drink and you can watch the world go by in this relaxing area. This hotel does not have a garden to sit in or too stroll around. The hotel seems ideal for the business man as it has all you might need in a secure, small and compact way, and for people on a long weekend away, we enjoyed our stay at the hotel. Perhaps next time we would like to stay a little closer to the centre of Madrid to save on the 18 minute journey time into the centre by Metro. However, the hotel is in a nice quiet, clean, and safe area. All in all, a nice hotel with a good connection to the centre of Madrid by Metro \u2013 18 minutes and 1 Euro.

Being a bit further out of the centre means you can sit outside in the evening without the noise of the city centre, and there are a couple of other pubs (including an Irish one) just up the road if you don't want to stay in the hotel in the evening. the metro runs late so there's no problem getting to the city centre if you want a big night out. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and hope to go back myself.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cWay out of the way\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3999500", "Content": "This hotel was adequate, espcially for the business traveler. Somewhere I read that it was close to the airport. Not so. It was in a residential neighborhood, with major traffric. Hard to get to from the airport and not very close to downtown either.

Located just in the residental part of Madrid, although on a main road, it was very quiet. One min walk away from the Metro ! A perfect location. The hotel was spotless and the staff very friendly. Fully air conditioned with fantastic showers. There is a nice \"porch\" outside which is open in the evening for meals or a drink which is nice when you don't fancy going into town.
