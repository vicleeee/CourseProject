It's a larger hotel and groups do require a lot of rooms. I'm not sure of the price because it was included in the trip.

We used this as a place to sleep and rest mainly, we would go out in the morning after breakfast, come back for a siesta during the afternoon then go out again in the evening. We would often use the hotel bar in the evening which was very pleasent with a nice selection of drinks. In general, the staff were a little rude but there were some exception i.e. the bar staff. The bed was comfortable and both my partner and myself slept soundly each and every night. The bathroom was smart and clean. There was one incident when someone came into our room while I was in the shower and my partner was reading a book in the window, neither of us saw who this person was but they left immediatly after opening the door. The breakfast in the morning was great, there was a large selection of food items and drinks. The best time to turn up for breakfast is early, I found that the best service was had during this time, the staff were friendly and the buffet table was filled. When I went down to breakfast later (towards the end of the alloted breakfasted time) it was alot busier and the staff were rushing around and looked quite pressured. The breakfast room is large but it would be impossible to fit all the guest in there at once, so going early would be best. The hotel is very close to the vatican and not far to walk for several other sites but the walk to the colosseum seemed to take forever. The restuarant accross the road from the hotel was great, I can't remember it's exact name but i know it was blue something or something blue, in italian though so azzurro something or something azzurro. During the summer months there are several restaurants and bar type things along the river tiber, just below the castel saint angelo and the building that seemed to be some sort of court. One I enjoyed in particular is T-bone station, although not very italian it was very nice and in a great location, I went about three or four times. If there was one bad point I would pick the following out. In order to get to rome we took two flights and as a result our baggage was late, I told the people at the reception that I was expecting luggage, when it arrived at the hotel the rang my room and bought the luggage up which would be great if it was not 0230 in the morning, I would of preferred them to keep the luggage until the morning and either rang me after 0600 or brought it up when they come to clean the room.

We arrived at about 8:30pm and checked in straight away. The check in staff were polite and helpful and gave us a map of Rome which we used every day. My room was on the end of a corridor and I seemed to have been upgraded as my room was twice the size of my friends room (we booked at the same time). The room was mostly clean and tidy, lots of toiletries, fresh towels etc. The \u2018niggles\u2019 were - Few hairs in the bath - My bath didn\u2019t have a plug, so I couldn\u2019t have a bath - Slight mould in the corner of the bath (see photo) - Shower head had limescale on it. - Bed covers were a single blanket and I got quite cold in the night None of it was \u2018hotels from hell\u2019 and if there had been a spare blanket in the cupboard, mould and hair wasn\u2019t there, I would have said the room was spotless. As it was on a main road, it was quite noisy if you kept the window open, but once shut, it wasn\u2019t too bad at all. Breakfast was perfectly adequate and nice \u2013 You got a good selection of pastries, meats etc \u2013 sadly on the second day the waiter seemed to forget my cup of tea and as I wasn\u2019t a coffee drinker, I wasn\u2019t able to have a caffeine fix! So again, a \u2018niggle\u2019. The lifts didn\u2019t seem to work very well, we stood on the ground floor for 3 minutes and pressed the button \u2013 nothing. It said the lift was on the 1st floor, so we walked up the stairs, pressed the button and the lift opened automatically... so, it seemed as if the buttons on the ground floor to call the lift were intermittently working. We didn\u2019t eat at the restaurant in the evening, but for lunch one day, we found the most AMAZING cafe 30 seconds walk from the hotel called Al Palazzaccio (see photo) which served the BEST pasta I have ever eaten and the waiters were brilliant. It was also quite cheap (8 euros for pasta) so would thoroughly recommend the cafe. My friend bought the movie and internet package for 14 Euros for 24 hours, sadly the internet connection wasn\u2019t great and half way through the movie, the TV reset itself... so another \u2018niggle\u2019 He managed to sort it out after 10 minutes, but you don\u2019t really want to be interrupted half way through a movie! It sounds a lot of \u2018bad\u2019 things, but none of it made our holiday horrible and we loved Rome. The hotel is very conveniently located and we managed to get from the airport for 15 Euros by taking the train to Rome termini (14 Euros) and taking the metro to Lepanto which cost 1 Euro as we got a 75 minute valid ticket. We did the same on the way back so it was much cheaper than a taxi. The hotel happily kept our luggage until we collected it, check out was absolutely fine and the concierge service was great. If the hotel sorted out all the small issues, I\u2019d quite happily give it 5/5 and even then, I would stay at this hotel again as there is nothing too bad about it \u2013 I just don\u2019t know whether you\u2019d get better service at another hotel for the same amount of money as it wasn\u2019t all that cheap.", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cHotel Cicerone--Great location\u201d", "Author": "Stretch2054", "ReviewID": "UR82340788", "Content": "Very nice hotel and the location is great in Rome.

Bus is very close by and subway is about a 2 1/2 block walk. Before the trip, I had not planned on using mass transit, but the convenience of it outweighed any negatives. Some subway cars look like the 1970's NYC subways with graffiti covering the entire cars, while others were spotless. Just ask the front desk for the correct bus numbers to take. The subway has maybe 20-30 stops total, so it's almost impossible to get lost. Front desk staff was over-the-top helpful in straightening out some gallery reservations WE had messed up in Florence. They stayed on the line, on hold, for over 20 minutes and resolved our mistakes. Great Job!

Our previous stay was in 2008 and the hotel had made a good impression with the only minus being that it is a bit off the historic city center, on the other side of the Tiber. As we were unable to find a more centrally located hotel with satifactory reviews at the same price range, we returned to the Cicerone and were not disappointed. Our rooms were of adequate size and the beds comfortable, the bathroom was spacious and clean with plentiful hot water. The air conditioning was working and units in each room could be turned on and off individually. The selection at breakfast was good, although we surprised to see that quite a lot of the cups were cracked or broken, which the staff seemed not to notice. Although most members of staff were attentive and the staff at reception was helpful and spoke English, some of the staff at breakfast could have been more courteous. The hotel restaurant was excellent. Room service was available but not on Sundays, which was a bit frustrating. The sight nearest to the hotel is Castel Sant Angelo, a 5-minute walk away. From there it takes about 10 to 15 minutes to walk to St. Peter at the Vatican. Piazza del Popolo is about 15 to 20 minutes' walk in the opposite direction across the Tiber. There is a bus terminal and a taxi rank in piazza Cavour which is less than 5 minutes walk away; and if you cannot walk that far, staff at the hotel's reception can call a taxi to pick you up at the hotel's entrance (but this makes the taxi ride a bit more expensive). The hotel can also arrange for a car to drive you to Fumicino airport for a price of EUR 55 (we were 4 persons with 5 pieces of laguage). Overall, we were happy with our stay at Cicerone and would probably stay there in the future.", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cSpotless, great location, efficient staff, good VFM\u201d", "Author": "obanknights", "ReviewID": "UR78485404", "Content": "Just back from 3 day trip to Rome.

The hotel common areas were great and the staff generally friendly and efficient. The bar staff were particularly efficient and attentive. Piano player in the evening gave a nice backdrop. Great location, 10mins leisurely walk to the St Peter\u2019s Square nicely interspersed with loads of shops. In the opposite direction, 10-15mins walk to the Spanish Steps which was vibrant all day and night. Also, convenient for city sightseeing bus stop at St Peter\u2019s Square. We booked a private taxi transfer from Rome Ciampino airport (55euros each way) and were pleasantly surprised to be collected by a large Mercedes upon arrival and a Jaguar for the return journey.

The best beach is on Stella Polare. there are very nice places but it will cost you between 8-10 EUR for Entry + sunbed and Umbrella . or do as we did take the free beach you dont need to pay anything for Entry. we paid \u00a85 EUR only for sun chair with little Umbrella mounted on the sun bed \"two in one\".

We made friends with Sandro and Raimondo on the Breakfasting staff and Marco the night porter last year , unfortunately Raimondo has now retired And Marco has now left , but Sandro is still there to advise and help with planned days out , he will tell you all the history of Rome and the most beatiful places to go and see that aren't on the tourist maps, he is also a part time Roman soldier with a historical group. One of Sandros recomendations is a day out at Austia Ancia this was the port of Rome and was a town of 100,000 people and was really some size and it is as good as pompei if not better , you will need to take a metro to get there but it is well worth it , and you will need a full day and good walking shoes , and take some water and sun block it gets hot , there is a open air theatre that is still in use today , when we were there there was a Shakespear week of plays on at night. There is also two nightime markets one at Castel Saint Angelo , this is in a lovely setting around the castel and has three stages for music , plays , and discusion groups, there are restaurants , bookstalls , gifts , clothes ect, the market is on till about 1.00 in the morning and is the place to go at night , then the other is down the river tiber about 1 or 2 kilometers from the castel , and is at Ponte Sisto just beside the Trastervere area , this market is even bigger and has very large bars ,food stalls , ect but there is also a open air cinema for about 200 seated , this is on the island in the tiber , if the market bores you , you could spend the night in the Trastevere areas many shops restaurants and bars in this quaint cobbled steet area that is regarded by many Romans as the true centre of Rome , and I can recomend the street artists and artistic photographers work. We even took a trip out with Sandro to a place near the Popes summer home ,( Castel Gandolfo ) the village was called Niemi and it is stunning its perched up on the rocky slopes of the moutain , and the local delicecy is crepes with nutella and wild strawberries they are to die for , the lake below is beautiful and serene . there was loads more fun , ie. Springsteen at the stadio olimpico. Everything was fabulous , apart from our arrival when we had a taxi con almost worked on us , last time to our hotel it was about 15 euro to the cicerone from termini train station , we had a driver of a white cab ask us if we wanted a taxi , they are the legitemate one you should always use , but he then said to his partner to take us, so he took us over the road and away from the taxi rank down a side street , so was concerned and asked him in the bit Italian that I know How much his reply was40 euro after I told him no he dropped the price to 30 euros , I told him no again so he dumped our cases and walked away swearing . So please try to check the farest and don't go away from the ranks. Oh and use the buses from the airports to the city as they are much cheaper and you can book your return as well .

I only booked it because it had been reduced from 1400 euros to 500 euros for that 5 nights so to be honest I was expecting something quite special and even though I had read the reviews, thought well for 1400 euros for 5 nights it must be quite good. Its near the metro, about a five minute walk away. There are loads of buses from outside the hotel which take you into the centre - so transport is not a problem, too be honest its walkable too, we usually walked home at the end of the day. There are some nice restaurants around the hotel if the thought of going back into the centre is just too tiring after a days sightseeing and a lovely cocktail/ice cream bar around the corner. We didnt try the hotel's restaurant at all expect for our breakfast which was included in the price. The breakfast was ok. Thats all I can say about it. I had scrambled egg and bread and honey every morning. My husband tried the bacon and sausages but didnt find them very nice. The first morning his coffee was fine, but the rest of the week it looked like a mud mixed with water and he said it tasted like it, it must have been made for so long before coming out to the table. Although I must say my tea was fine! They had a selection of cereal, youguts, cold meat and cheese as well, so I'm sure you could find something you liked. Also a small collection of cakes and bread. The room was pleasant, we were overlooking the courtyard so didnt suffer from the noise from the road, so cant comment on that. The bed was very comfortable, better than the mattress I have at home, I was very impressed with it. The only thing that let the room down was the shower, it was hot enough etc, but had no proper shower curtain so the floor got all wet and the shower tray overfilled. But we could live with that. I certainly found the room clean and the room was made every day with new towels, and the towels were full sized bath towels not the small ones you usually have to contend with which was lovely. I suppose my biggest beef, being a smoker - what with the smoking laws in Italy - that there was nowhere to go for a ciggy. No balcony, no couryard etc. I had to stand on the street out side the hotel, so this was why we didnt have a drink or eat there as there are so many places with seating outside that you can.

I would argue that it is definitely not up to the standard of a 4 star hotel, more like a 3 star at most. It has a rather dated 70's feel to it and the view from the balcony in our room was rather unpleasant/dire to say the least - we kept the curtains firmly drawn to block out the bleak, scruffy internal courtyard/fire escape. The room was very spacious, but could have done with a spruce up & lick of paint as the walls were a bit marked/grimy & there was a distinct lack of hangers. You need to be at least 5ft 6inches tall to reach the hanger rail in the wardrobe, I managed this fine but anyone smaller would have had to get a chair and climb up. There was also a pull down sofa unfortunately with a with a rather tatty cover. The highlight of our stay came when the fire alarms went off at approx 11.30 pm when we were snoozing in bed after a marathon days sightseeing - we threw some clothes on, grabbed our purse/wallet and legged it out of the room, down a metal fire escape to the grimy courtyard where I pulled open a metal gate to access the main street. We walked back into the hotel through the main entrance to find a few other sensible bods had responded to the fire alarm & were in their PJ's at reception or looking half asleep sitting close by. It was like a scene from Titanic as the 'turn' kept singing in the bar area & other guests laughed & carried on drinking - False alarm just the electrician set it off! I overheard an American guy at reception saying that this had also happened a few times earlier in the day and he wanted to complain to the manager. All said, the fire escape worked well, although my hands were black from the gate I'd opened and my face/clothes looked like i'd been down a coal mine were I'd touched them. Take your own corkscrew if you plan on opening a bottle of wine etc, they will insist on bringing one to your room & charging you 3 euros for the pleasure of the housekeeping bod opening your bottle. Also if you need anything ironing, bring your own travel iron - they won't lend you an iron/board and the prices are pretty steep for the hotel laundry to iron your clothes if required. The breakfast is mediocre & I gave the runny scrambled eggs & hot dog sausages a wide berth, although the coffee was quite nice. The reception staff were pleasant enough- especially a young guy who we found to be very helpful and informative. A hotel car/mercedes back to ciampino airport cost a fixed price of 50 euros. To sum up, we had a pleasant enough stay - room/hotel we expected a little bit more of and it was not of a 4 star standard.", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cClean hotel\u201d", "Author": "newbie_traveler3", "ReviewID": "UR19093812", "Content": "Stayed here as part of a Globus Tour of Italy.

I was actually quite comfortable and they provided me with the number of pillows that I requested immediately. The closet was exceedingly small, but they gave me tons of extra clothes hangers and there was a cul-de-sac in the wall that we used for folded garments and even our suitcases. All in all, more than enough space to be comfortable. The bathroom was larger than those in most American hotels and was very clean. Lots of counter space and we had no trouble storing our toiletries. We didn't eat at the restaurant as there are SO many fantastic options within TRUE walking distance. But we did have a pre-dinner drink every night at the bar. Gianni (spelling?) is the BEST bartender I've ever seen. Funny, professional and informative. He had me hooked on an Italian apertif called Martini Bianco. Try it on ice! Your room key is on a huge brass ball and you drop it off at the front desk as you leave each day. The funny thing, is that anyone can ask for any room key and RECEIVE it! I did this deliberately just to see what would happen. Oh well, the in-room safe worked and I never, ever felt uncomfortable.
