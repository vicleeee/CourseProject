The pool area was smaller than expected, and quite crowded. Our daughter (a not-picky 11 year old) finally just got out because there were so many people in such a small pool. But the hotel cannot control that, it's just something to be prepared for if you book here. The breakfast is great, plenty of variety. The lobby seems well kept, plenty of seating for breakfast. I did not take advantage of the evening free reception snacks, as they did not offer any sweets. I would have appreciated cookies or brownies. But then again, I have a terrible sweet tooth, so maybe that's just me! Parking is pricey, $43 a night for self park. Worth it though, not to have to try mess with finding a cheaper garage.

The front desk staff was awesome. Clementine was a superstar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c friendly and engaging. In my online reservation I requested a high floor and a corner room. My request was honored. I have stayed in both a corner room and a normal room. It is true that the corner room was very quiet. Request it if you are a light sleeper or want total quiet. I was not bothered by noise in the normal room, but I was on the top floor so that might have been the reason. The rooms are a bit smaller than other Embassy Suites were I have stayed in the past. I stayed by myself so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an issue. Breakfast looked very tasty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bacon, sausage, pancakes, scrambled eggs, made to order omelets, potatoes, biscuits, oatmeal, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal and pastries. It was hard to resist all the options and stick to my healthy new year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolutions, but I had lots of fresh pineapple and cantaloupe. Unfortunately, there was not fresh cut fruit on the weekend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only oranges. I did notice long lines for the made to order items. The manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reception was great too. There was an open bar serving wine, beer, sangria, mixed drinks and non alcoholic options. Again too bad I was not drinking alcohol, but I had several club sodas with lime \u00ef\ufffd\u0160. On busy nights there is a long line, had to wait about 10 minutes. There were also snacks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c salsa, hummus, olives, snack mixes, and nuts. No line for the food. Another great amenity was the three computers in the lobby with free printing. If you are looking to feed yourself there is a grocery store (Dominick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) right across the street and a Trader Joe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s within walking distance. For shopping and dining Michigan Avenue is about two blocks away. I took public transportation to and from O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare. The bus stops are less than a block from the hotel and connect right to the train. Super easy to get yourself to the hotel for less than 3 bucks. Two complaints. The heat in my room was not very powerful. Maid service was slow. One night they did not get to my room until after 6pm. The maid service carts were in the hallways for most of the day.

SInce I had work to complete before late afternoon appointments, I took the smoking room. When I walked in the room, I was shocked at the condition of the room. It looked as if a brawl had raged in the suite: hole in bathroom door, cigarette burn on toilet seat, long burn marks on living room area carpet, scuffed-up furniture, and stains on couch. Moreover, there was extensive mildew/mold in the corners of the shower/tub. No bureau/drawers in bedroom, but there was a bureau in the living room. Was quite surprised by the run-down condition of the room. Later, I found the refrigerator had not been cleaned either. Bed was fine, and HVAC controls worked. I tipped the maid well each day and received decent maid service. As others have noted, the made-to-order breakfast line took a very long time, even at the weekday opening time. I skipped the line on the weekend mornings, as I had 8:00 AM appointments a few blocks away. I worked late in my room two nights, and made the mistake of ordering room service one night. Thirty-five dollars for a pizza that was perhaps the worst representation of Chicago deep dish I have ever encountered. Skipped the evening receptions as I had no interest in waiting in line for a bowl of bar snacks and a glass of juice.

The location is good, but overall, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed, starting with check in.

The first smelled bad, second was an accessible room and the third was stuffed in the corner and about \u00c2\u00be the size of the other rooms.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen lines like this at any hotel (well okay\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6maybe Disney during prime season but nowhere else). The made to order line took 1 hour to get through (not exaggerating\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6there is a clock right next to the line). Unfortunately, I was dumb enough to stand in it, not realizing how slow it would be. Makes sense it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so slow with only one person cooking. The drink line at the evening reception took about 15 to 20 minutes to get through and they are VERY strict about getting one drink at a time. Makes for a less than enjoyable time waiting so long for one drink. They are free, but I think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather pay to avoid the long lines (not an option). They never did deliver the waters they promised. Also, the walls are VERY thin. The lady next door wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop coughing and the kids on the other side were very loud too. The maid service was barely passable\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even put the cover back on the bed. It was on the floor when I got back.

When I called to talk to the manager the morning of checkout, the operator couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even put me through because there was only 1 front desk person, a long line in the lobby and someone else on hold (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what she told me).

The deal they gave us was unbelievable - roughly $103/night for 4 including breakfast. So why the poor grade. Firstly the walls are paper thin and for the first two nights our \"neighbors\" were really loud late at night. The first night the beleaguered management dealt with them by sending someone up. The second night (it was a different family next door) they management did not really deal with it. Two bad nights sleep was too much. We did change rooms to a quiet \"corner\" room - these are much better. Now as for breakfast. Well the deal was such a great one the entire hotel was filled with families. So BF was jammed - it consisted of industrially produced scrambled eggs, pancakes, diced spuds, and turkey bacon - it was okay but really just sustenance not a meal. If you got to breakfast after 9:00 am (and we did) there were long lines, lots of jostling families, and kids of all ages swirling around. So yes, they include breakfast - but it was really not all that tasty or relaxing. BF was also served next to the pool area and the entire lobby area was suffused with the smell of chlorine - again, you get what you pay for. Would I go back - sadly no, next time I will go to a place where I am ensured a quiet night's sleep and buy my own BF.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "southern US", "Title": "\u201cGreat bargain, but staff struggled to keep up with the crowds\u201d", "Author": "Yankeeinexile", "ReviewID": "UR122365927", "Content": "We stayed here for five days over Christmas.

You can leave your car for 15 minutes while you register, and the staff will bring your bags up for you. Parking is $42 a night so we parked elsewhere. The hotel is fine...we were upgraded to a corner suite and if you can get one, you should. Not only was it quieter (more on that later) but we did not have the window to the constantly-lit atrium. This was important for putting kids to bed. Corner suites are much larger in the living room as well. The walls are paper thin in this hotel....we could hear our neighbor talking on the phone, clearly, and could hear both TV and talking through the vents, not sure where it came from. Beds are comfy, shower head is weak pressure-wise, and the hairdryer was on it's last legs. But the furniture and carpet were clean and in good condition, and towels were very plentiful. The fitness room is ridiculously small....3 treadmills, 2 ellipticals and a bike. Got crazy crowded between 7 and 8 am, but that was NOTHING compared to the crazyness at breakfast after 8:15 or so. Long lines for food, no tables to be had, the staff did their best to keep up but it was nearly impossible for them to do so. We ate before 8:15 one morning and it was a completely different experience.

We were in Chicago for a business convention and I booked this room months prior to our arrival. We are HHonors members and only stay at Hilton properties, thus the reservation at this hotel. The conference we were attending was held one block up the street at the Sheraton, however, with the close proximity, and being loyal to Hilton, we opted to walk every day to the Sheraton. Upon arrival, we checked in, and were given an upgrade from a King suite to a Corner king suite...nice gesture we thought for our loyalty. Wish now that we had declined the upgrade and taken the regular suite. We were on the 8th floor and the corner rooms are very secluded and down a short hall way, if that is what you are looking for. We did not want to seem ungrateful for the upgrade, so we decided to stay in room 825. Mistake!!! When we got into the room, the window was propped open, and maintenance did come and correct the problem. The first night we were there, the coffee maker , which is not programmable, just came on by itself, and started to brew. I called downstairs, maintenance went into the room next door, brought another coffee maker. You would think, prior to bringing a replacement, the employee would make sure it was clean and free of nasty left over coffee, but NO. But it didn't matter, because housekeeping for some odd reason never replenished our coffee, sugars anyway. The remote control to the living area TV did not operate at all, and maintenance said they fixed it, but the same night, we had the same issues. Anytime we wanted to change a channel or the volume, we had to manually do it on the tv. Maintenance man did state to me that they had just made the switch to HD TV and they had been having nothing but problems. So, if being able to watch tv is important to you, this could be a problem. WORST of all, the temperature handle on the shower was faulty and would not stay where you set the handle for hot/cold temperature. After I was SCALDED with extremely hot water when I took my first shower, maintenance came up, and said he fixed the problem....however, the next morning, the same thing happened to my husband. I told him maintenance had been in and corrected the problem, so my husband took my word. This could be very dangerous with a small child, and I am so thankful that it was not my 3 year old daughter who was scalded with hot water. THERE WAS NO CONCIERGE available, even though the hotels website states otherwise. The front desk was below par in recommendations for entertainment, dining, transportation....Needless to say, I truly feel like a good chunk of our trip was spending time with the maintenance man, as well as being our own concierge. So much time wasted on our trip for unneccessary things. Asked for a one hour late check out on departure day, and was told the \"hotels occupancy level could not allow for such.\" Never experienced this with any brand of Hilton before, as its usually granted. So, when we got downstairs to the ground level, the bellman was too busy on his phone and never acknowledged us, so, we hailed our own cab. On the positive, breakfast was great....Miss Shirley really knows how to please her guests and is by far, the most pleasant employee at this establishment. Evening reception....drinks are good, lines are long(which is not a problem), but not the normal eats for Embassy suites..chips, nuts, salsa. No hot food, not even pasta. and The SAME EVERY NIGHT...it never changed in the 3 nights we stayed. The business center is poorly stocked, no stapler, paper clips, etc for the true business traveler in need....I have stayed in Hampton Inns and Homewood Suites, which have FAR exceeded this property and were $200 less per night. I addressed all of these issues with the front desk agent upon my departure. She didn't really seem concerned with me or the issues we experienced, and my husband would have never said a word no matter how unhappy he was, so I spoke up. We are going back to Chicago at the end of November, and I seriously doubt we will be staying at this hotel, despite its good location for us. Once I get back in the groove of things at home, I plan on calling Hilton Headquarters to voice my concerns, if I do not hear from the manager of this hotel first. I know the price of the room is fair for Chicago, but we could have received a discount at the Sheraton with our group, and I must say, we spent a good deal of time at the Sheraton, and it is a BEAUTIFUL hotel, with a concierge on staff, and the employees over there are fabulous....seemed as though they aimed to please. Just sorry that we did not stay there. Our bill for 3 nights at the Embassy Suites was close to $1200.00....Very dissappointed all the way around. Feel as though we could have had less maintenance issues, a dedicated concierge agent to help us with things we wanted to see in Chicago, and not been burnt by hot water while showering....Below Par for me....not what I had expected in any form...I strongly believe in giving fair and honest reviews, and give credit where credit is due(see my other reviews), but this was not good for us...Based on service, room rates should be a half to a third of what we paid....", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cNice Location and View, but otherwise...eh.....\u201d", "Author": "HiggySTL", "ReviewID": "UR119037179", "Content": "We stayed here with our kids during the holidays (Dec'10) for easy access to Michigan Ave for shopping.

The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of downtown and is literally steps from all the places to visit like Navy Pier, Magnificent Mile, Water tower, River cruises, restaurants, top shopping malls theaters and lot more. The area is family friendly and you can wonder around even in the late evening hours with family. The breakfast buffet package was fabulous and it had huge variety to select from and every thing to interest even the most selective eaters. The staff at the breakfast was very polite, professional and helpful. The room was clean and had two flat panel TV's so that children can watch there stuff in there room and you have your own screen to enjoy. Surprisingly the room was big enough to have a small kitchenette, dinning table set, study, sofa bed and an extra vanity to help a family with early morning washroom rush. The house keeping staff was excellent and the room was cleaned and done nicely each evening when we returned back from all day tour. The room was very quite and no downtown noise even though it was on 7th floor and facing street and river. I will strongly recommend this hotel to everyone and you will not be disappointed with the price, quality, food and the luxury of the suite. For us this was worth every penny.

There was a nice restaurant in the building, but I can't review that, as I didn't use it. Nice easy walk to Navy Pier. The lobby of this hotel is spacious and very beautiful. Waterfall in the center, lobby bar and breakfast area all nice. Like other Embassy Suites they have made the lobby bright, sunny and inviting. My room was very nice, king with a sofa bed, flat screen TV's and spacious bathroom. The room was decorated nicely, and VERY clean. All of the staff were wonderful, especially the Valet and bell staff. All of them went out of their way to make me feel like a valued guest, and they were very polite. The Bad: Again, typical of Chicago, parking price is outrageous, $50 per night to valet... if you don't have to drive and park there, that would be beneficial to your wallet. Room was $249, but that's expected. The Ugly: If you make me pick one bad thing, it was the breakfast. Yes, it's \"Free\" but WAY too crowded, unorganized, and to accommodate everyone they had extra tables set up everywhere. The food, average at best as far as the buffet line. If you make it through the custom hot breakfast line, that was much better, the omelet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were very good, the chef's and other staff, again, VERY nice. :) Hope this helps.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value, very convenient and accomodating staff\u201d", "Author": "mrtimmy1122", "ReviewID": "UR118032398", "Content": "I took a school group here for a few nights on a field trip in Chicago.

I realize this is the design of Embassy Suites to have the rooms on the perimeter of an atrium and have stayed at them before without having a problem. So I'm not sure if it was the glass or what, but this one made all of us uncomfortable to walk along the hall. Probably also particularly scary because of having children with us.

Cons: - When we arrived in our room, there was a hole in the door between the living area and sleeping area. Not too nice. On arrival I told both the bellhop and another employee to please note the damage so we wouldn't be billed. It would have been nice for them at that point to offer a different room. Didn't happen. Worse, though, is that upon arriving at home we received a bill for $75 for room damage!! It took multiple phone calls and quite a bit of time and hassle to rectify. Frustrating since 1) normally we don't like staying in a room with holes in the doors and 2) we told two people to note the damage so we wouldn't be billed and we still got billed. - Concierge. The single most pretentious, unhelpful, and condescending concierge I have ever met. I have stayed at some of the nicest hotels in the world, including in Chicago (Drake, Peninsula, Trump). The concierge at the Embassy Suites in Chicago, of all places, was incredibly rude and unhelpful. - Bellhop. On checking out I needed assistance with my luggage. I was alone with two very small children which makes it very hard to deal with luggage and kids at the same time. I called multiple times for the bellhop on checkout. Waited almost 30 minutes.

The free breakfast is really nice and the rooms are so big and clean. It is so open and the staff are very friendly. My biggest complaint about this hotel is that they charge so much for internet. In this day and age it is a shock to me that they charge so much. $3.95 per hour or $14.95 for 24 hours plus taxes I stayed in room 829 this time which is a smoking room with 2 double beds. My deadbolt didn't work but the other locks did and I did not feel unsafe. The furniture was in good shape and there were flat screen tvs in the bedroom and livingroom. They have a very poor selection of channels to watch but have movies starting at $4.99. They have a few at that price and the rest are $10.99 to $16.99. I would have rented one for $4.99 but the only one at that price that interested me I had already seen. This room had a great view which I have never had at this hotel before. I could see the lake and it was very relaxing. The room has a coffee maker, fridge and microwave for your use. They also supply glasses and glass cups. I prefer paper cups but it is what it is. They did have cardboard cup surrounds with the coffee maker so it looks like they should have had paper cups. Housekeeping was not good about filling the coffee station so I'm not sure what should have been there. After I used the tea bags I never received any more. The room also has an iron, ironing board and hairdryer. The iron and ironing board are in the hall closet. There was tons of storage and lights and lots of seating. What is nice if traveling with someone else is that there is a door between the livingroom and bedroom. There are lots of electrical outlets to plug things in which I greatly appreciate. A nice big desk/table with a work chair and 2 other chairs. Also I nice couch and chair in the livingroom. The kitchenette sink dripped the whole time and was annoying. I could here my neighbors when in the livingroom but not in the bedroom so it wasn't that bad. They provide bar soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. I was surprised that housekeeping threw away my open soap the first morning and replaced it with a new one. I'm used to them leaving it since it is barely used and leaving a new one in case you need it. It seemed like such a waste to me. I did stop at the evening reception Sunday night and got some snacks but opted not to have a drink. There was a line but it moved quickly. Monday I enjoyed a breakfast around 7 am and it was not busy. I didn't opt for the cooked to order but went with the buffet. The food on the buffet was not hot. Don't know if that was a one time thing or if it is always not kept hot. It bothered me to see that not many people left a tip for the staff. They were great and kept everything cleaned and all the food filled. One thing that bothered me was that they used styrofoam cups instead of paper. Later I noticed that it got really busy for breakfast but it was moving pretty fast. Tuesday morning and I did the made to order omlet. The cook was great when I asked for a little omlet. Usually cooks still make it huge and I can't eat it all but he honored my request. The coffee was good I enjoyed the food. The problem on Tuesday was the lipstick on my juice glass when I wasn't wearing any. Overall the staff was great including an early check-in. The gift shop staff varied greatly with the Sunday evening staff being so nice and the Monday morning lady being snooty and didn't even look at you when talking to you. The elevators went down one day for awhile while I was away from the hotel at meetings. They were fixed quickly. The internet went out at the same time and later that night we lost the tv for a few minutes but everything was quickly fixed. There is a free business center one level down from the lobby.

I recommend this hotel for its competitive rates (given each room is larger than the average downtown Chicago hotel room), the complimentary full breakfast, the central downtown location and the friendly staff (from the ground floor bellman to the lobby concierge and front desk staff). This hotel is situated midway between the higher priced hotels in the North Michigan Avenue area (about 2 blocks away) and the Navy Pier (about 4 blocks away). We caught the Orange Line Metro from Midway Airport and then transferred onto the Red Line Metro (exiting at the Grand Station stop which is an easy 7 block walk away from the hotel). The Embassy Suites is part of the block-wide River East Center which includes a huge AMC multiplex cinema, the cool Lucky Strike Lanes bowling alley, a Bally's Fitness and a ground floor Walgreens. The surrounding area of the hotel is a beehive of activity with plenty of tourists heading towards Navy Pier, residents who live in the surrounding high rise apartments and condos and workers from the surrounding office towers. Across the street is a huge Dominick's Supermarket stocked not only with groceries but excellent prepared-foods counters. A few blocks north or west you will find an interesting range of eclectic restaurants and the high end shops of North Michigan Avenue. Our double double suite was fine for the four of us. The suite was nicely decorated and the furniture was adequate and functional, not luxurious but certainly consistent with the Embassy Suites brand. There were minor deferred maintenance issues that the housekeeping staff of the hotel needed to address that included dusting of the lamp shades in our suite, cleaning of the dirty stairwells, and better maintenance of the two sets of coin operated washers and dryers. However the visible public areas of the hotel were maintained nicely and our requests for additional blankets, shampoo and soap were promptly delivered. The daily complimentary breakfasts were consistent to the Embassy Suites brand and the wait times after 8:30 AM were rather long as other posters have noted. The selection was good and consisted of scrambled wet eggs, sausage and bacon, potatoes, pancakes, fresh fruit, 3 selections of cereal, yogurt, breads, donuts and pastries. The same items were also available in the cooked to order omelet line as well. Staff did a great job of clearing dirty dishes from the large number of tables and extra tables were set up each day to accommodate the crowd. We used the fitness room daily, but it was very small and limited with a rack of free weights, three treadmills, one recumbent bike and a couple elliptical. The indoor lap pool was short and narrow. Both seemed like an afterthought and we wished the hotel arranged for complimentary fitness passes to a nearby health club like the Bally's.

The hotel is centrally located minutes from the lakefront, Navy Pier, downtown attractions, the Magnificent Mile shops, etc. I arrived on a Monday afternoon by an airport shuttle bus, which dropped me off at the main entrance, which is surprisingly located in the back of the hotel. The reception is located on the third floor (you have to take elevators to get there). The hotel lobby was nice and bright and very open (from reception floor all the way to the top). It was very noisy, however, as there were a great number of people waiting in line at the bar for the daily manager's reception. The registration process was quick and painless. My room was on the 13th floor, and set in a little corridor off the main balcony facing the open lobby. This was great two-fold: 1) no noise and 2) better for someone who is afraid of heights. The reason I mention acrophobia is because almost all of the rooms face the open lobby, separated only by a walkway and a plexiglass barrier (low). I was getting vertigo every time I had to walk to and from my room to the elevator. Although I didn't visit with my child, as a parent, I Would have been concerned about the kids safety as they could easily lean over the banister and plunge 10+ stories down. The suite was nice and clean. The living room had a wardrobe closet with a flatscreen tv, a sofa bed, coffee table, an armchair and a table/desk with 2 chairs. There is a little wet bar/kitchenette area in the hallway separating the living room from the bedroom with a sink, coffeemaker, mini fridge and a microwave. Opposite the kitchenette is a bathroom with standard features. The Bedroom was nice and had a TV armoir with yet another sink. I found myself not really using the living room as I was staying there alone, but it would have been great for entertaining or hanging out with family if more people were sharing a suite. There is a window with shutters facing the hallway and I did have some privacy concerns as they are not completely impermeable to light. The daily breakfast in the lobby was nice. Average selection and it does get crowded if you sleep in as all of the families with loud hungry kids flood the lobby before heading out for their daily adventures. But if you're there before 7:30AM, it's fine. The swimming pool is really small and if you get at least 1 kid in there, it becomes impossible to swim in. There is also a whirlpool that gets filled with kids as well. Did I say it was a family friendly hotel? There is also a sauna, which seemed to be the only kid-free place in the pool area. Having given up on swimming in the hotel, I ended up walking over to the lake beach, which is only a 5 min walk from the hotel. Hotel reception staff were very friendly and gave us pointers about dining options and local attractions. Now about the business facilities. The 2nd floor of the hotel is a conference center with large ballrooms and smaller rooms for breakout sessions. The facilities were nice, but one MAJOR complaint I have is the internet. There is no WiFi signal in the business area and I was disappointed that after paying $15 for WiFi, I could not use it most of the day while attending meetings on the 2nd floor. The signal in the rooms was a little stronger, but the connection was very slow. Overall, if you are visiting with a family and want to have a central location to all of the attractions, this is a great hotel! The free breakfast is nice, there is a restaurant on the first floor and a supermarket across the street. Daily manager's reception is also nice with free drinks and snacks. It is a noisy hotel, so if you want a quiet retreat, it may not be for you. Also, if you are afraid of heights like me, you may have a difficult time adjusting to the open lobby concept.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat location!

We had no problems at breakfast (8:30ish each day) and only did the managers reception once. The lines move quick for both and the food/drinks where pretty good. The hotel tries very hard at breakfast setting up additional tables and two additional buffet lines for those not wanting to do the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cook to order\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Our walk to Grant Park was about a mile but it was fine and nice to see the city at night. The day we left we took a towncar from the hotel back to airport, it cost a bit extra at $45 but sooo much more comfortable then a taxi. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would go back.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cAnother great stay\u201d", "Author": "SheraBella", "ReviewID": "UR116282736", "Content": "This is my third stay at this property.

We were told to bring our bags back downstairs to the bell man who would hold them in a secure location. Well, we waited for about 10 minutes along with several racks of other luggage until the bell man even showed up.

Called in advance to make sure son's name on one suite so he & family could check in prior to our arrival. Check-in was smooth for both suites which were next to each other. Typical arrangement for Embassy Suites.... 2 rooms... one with sofa, chairs, desk, chairs and small wet bar with refrigerator and the other room with bed(s)... with bathroom being in shortl hallway dividing both rooms. Rooms arranged around center atrium. Overall hotel atmosphere - very bright, clean, modern decor. There are 4 glass enclosed elevators to access suites from the main lobby. Of note, is that the lobby entrance is NOT on the street level. Street Elevator lobby, & valet parking attendants are on 1st floor (Self-parking - $41.00 daily but with NO in&out; Valet parking $49 daily... with in& out privileges). Valet service may take up to 20 minutes to get car... so call from the room & plan accordingly. Breakfast buffet is very good, although lines are long if one goes down in the last hour. Suggestion... go early like at 7:30 or 8 a.m. Omelet station is run well, with one person taking orders and putting out the various ingredients for the chef to add to the omelets. Chef is amazing at the speed in which he makes omelets... fun to watch. Can also get pancakes, biscuits with gravey, hash browns and pancakes in this line.There is also a buffet line for eggs, bacon, etc on steam table. Assorted pastries, yogurt, cereals, and fruit... although fruit could have been expanded. During the week days, the fruit was sliced melons and pineapple. On weekend, fruit was limited to whole oranges and bananas but no pre-sliced melons. On the weekend the hotel was filled with families instead of business people... perhaps that made a difference in what was put out. There is a very large seating area and the tables were quickly cleaned with hotel staff. Suites had 2 flat screen TVs plus sofa, & 3 chairs in living room, one of which was a very comfortable ergonomic chair. Our son's suite did not have an ergonomic chair. There was also a very large ottoman suitable for seating. Directly across the street from the hotel is a large market - Dominick's that also has a Starbucks. Domick's is open until at least midnight and some nights until 1 a.m. In addition to the normal food supplies, one can purchase bus passes at Dominicks... we highly recommend... it's so easy to jump on and off a bus to Navy Pier... the buses are air conditioned, the free trolley is NOT! It's also an easy walk to Michigan Avenue where many buses can be picked up going to and from the Museum Campus and up and down the Magnificent Mile shopping district. Many of the Chicago taxi's are NOT air conditioned. Be careful in flagging down a cab that has windows rolled down! Some cabs are hybrids and drivers actually USE their AC. When we asked valet attendant about getting us a cab to the airport, he suggested we consider a town car as it would be more comfortable with only a slightly higher cost. We opted for this and he immediately called a town car and we paid a flat rate of $45. plus the tip.

The line for the prepared food was slightly better but still long and the prepared scambled eggs bin was often empty. The selection of fruit at the buffett was also poor compared to other locations. During heavy travel time be prepared to wait. The evening reception also had long lines for drinks.

The location is great for sightseeing, as many other reviews describe. Our room also had a great view of the lake from the 14th floor (out of 17). The room was very spacious as you would expect from Embassy Suites. What really impressed me, though, was the nice decor, service, and attention to detail. Checkin was easy and pleasant as Dinah provided great service (she did solicit a TripAdvisor review, but I was already planning on writing one and she gave great service anyway). She was there every single morning during our 4-day stay! The breakfast buffet was excellent. There is a very large variety of choices as well as an omelet station. The manager's reception served free cocktails and snacks from 5:30-7:30. The snacks were good in amount but a healthier variety have been nice. Lots of salty snack varieties and only a bowl of raisins as an alternative. Overall, for all of this being FREE, it was very satisfying. The room itself is very nicely decorated. Clean, bright, and inviting, it was the nicest room I've had at an Embassy Suites. I must give major kudos to the housekeeping staff. Our room was serviced after the first night and the housekeeper observed that on my bed, I had removed the down pillows and used the one foam instead. She replaced the other two down pillows so I had all foam pillows - nice touch. Also, the next day we left the do not disturb sign on the door because we did not need service. We received a call and voicemail from housekeeping letting us know to notify them if we needed service or any extra items. Very personal gestures. The pool is a lap pool, which is nice. The jacuzzi is large, and there is also a dry sauna around the corner. The fitness room next door is well equipped. One odd note - we wanted to check our bags for a few hours at checkout time. The lobby is on the 5th floor and luggage check is on the first. I confirmed the location with the front desk and was told that bags are indeed stored on the first floor, but if we have a laptop we can keep it at the front desk. This made me wonder about the security of our bags on the first floor. Perhaps the front desk was just offering safety deposit box service, but I found it odd nonetheless, since it wasn't exactly convenient to store our laptop 5 floors from the rest of our bags. There are many, many nice hotels that have great locations in Chicago. A hotel really needs to be top notch or else there are plenty of other places for guests to stay.

Additionally, you can't beat the complimentary breakfast and evening drinks that are offered daily [One piece of advice: if you are expecting to get an omelet cooked to order, wake up early because the line gets long quickly]. Also, the pool and fitness center make the Embassy Suites a good stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel for families with children. However, that being said, there are some things that you should be aware of. If you are staying as a family with more than 4 people, somebody will likely have to sleep on the dreaded pull-out sofa. Unfortunately, I had this wonderful privilege for two nights and did not like it at all. The window shades in the rooms aren't sufficient enough to block out the incredibly bright lights from the lobby, and the sofa has a typically uncomfortable spring mattress that is difficult to sleep on. If you are not staying as a family, be warned that this place is popular with families and can be somewhat noisy and crowded on weekends. Also, parking is outrageously expensive ($49 for valet in-and-out), so if possible, I would highly recommend getting around using \"the L\", Chicago's subway system (a 3-day pass only costs $14, and the Grand Red Line station is about 6 blocks from the hotel). In all, this hotel is definitely a solid choice for its great location near Navy Pier, Michigan Avenue, the Tribune Building, and the river.

The breakfasts were very good. There was a lengthy line at the start of the nightly cocktail receptions but they moved fairly quickly. As mentioned by others - the pool was small - we didn't even bother going down there after glancing at it upon arrival. The exercise area was OK but lacking adequate strength training options. The location is very good. As mentioned, parking is a bit steep at $41 for self-park but, that's par for the course at all other hotels in the downtown area as well. You could opt to park at a nearby public garage but it wasn't worth the minimal savings to me to be outside the hotel. Our only negative experience was with housekeeping. Although one wouldn't notice it taking a stand-up shower, my wife noticed some nasty black mold under the grab rail in the tub while taking a bath. We left a note for the maid and she made a half-hearted effort to remove it - about 25% remained when we returned. Apparently, she wasn't going to bother getting a brush and whatever chemicals were needed to remove the remainder. There was also what appeared to be greenish spit (saliva) on one of the porcelain caps that cover the screws that hold the toilet to the floor. That remained there for two days before I ended up nearly gagging and cleaning it myself with a washcloth. Those are items I would never allow at my own home and certainly don't expect to have to deal with at an Embassy Suites hotel.

It looked to be maybe 6 feet wide. Why have a pool, there was no room for anyone to even swim except maybe one person doing a lap. The breakfast was awesome. It offered things like eggs, bacon, omletes, pancakes, fresh fruit, donuts, juices and much more. Yes there were lines, but not unmanageable. Location was great to Navy Pier or Michigan Avenue.

Good bath stuff. Now to the eh... 1. The room is dated. Our first room had a malfunctioning cabinet door and non working mini fridge. We called down and was moved to a different room immediately. Which was nice (hence the great staff comment). Microwave is OLD, mini fridge doesn't really cool properly, shower doesn't work properly either (the knob to change from tub to shower sticks really bad. 2. Bfast line can get really bad if you don't get there early. Manager's reception is the same way. 3. I always check the pillows and beds before we settle in the room, the pillow had a stain on it... ew... 4. Missing coffee in the amenities box 5. For some reason the trash cans/bins do not have any liners anymore. Not sure if that's a cost loss or what. But when you have a baby who's still in diapers it is kinda gross to just dump it in the can/bin. So we had to scrounge around for plastic bags. 6. Self parking is $41/night ... oy... 7.

(After a complaint on that to E.S. they did take care of us, but that doesn't excuse the rest of the weekend.) Everyday we had to ask for more towels and washcloths because there were 4 of us in the room, NOT two. (Even the spares from the night before they would end up taking.) They would take the blankets and never leave any coffee cups...even though there are tea bags, coffee and a coffee maker. The elevators worked half the time. The hotel seemed to be close to full capacity by the weekend. It could take as long as 7 minutes to get an elevator. There were no vending machines on the 10th floor, but the sign still said there was. The machines on 8,9 and 11 were broken. So, after 20 minutes of attempting to purchase a bottle of water... I finally found one on the 6th floor. The breakfast had was mediocre at best. At the other Embassy Suites, there's more \"made to order\" food than just omelets, not here. The pancakes by Sat. were so hard on the edges, I couldn't even cut through them... and my 3 year old wouldn't even have anything to do with them. The donuts looked like they were about a week old. And the variety of any of the food never changed... 4 days in a row of that is a little too much. The guests by weekend were rude as well. Allowing children to run the hallways and scream at 10:30 at night is uncalled for when traveling on business. Not to mention, the sirens every 2 minutes on the streets below were horrible. If they just provided a sound machine, would have been wonderful. Finally, the stench in the rooms from the humidity was awful! By the end of the trip we couldn't get out fast enough. Even my 3 year old daughter kept complaining of the \"sour\" smell in the room. It was disgusting. And to top off the exit, we needed a larger taxi as we had been there 5 days and were 4 people. The cab driver that was there flipped out. Got out of his car and started a shouting fest! As if we'd even feel comfortable driving with an irate taxi driver at that point.

There is just so much to see and do in Chicago, it could easily make a week-long family vacation destination. The hotel was walking distance to Navy Pier, Michigan Avenue, Hancock Building, Water Tower Mall, and the Hershey Store. Also during the trip, had the opportunity to go to Shaw\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Crab House for the Sunday Brunch. All I can say to the seafood lover is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unbelievable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I never knew king crab could taste so fresh!...and homemade lollipops too\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.

The location of the hotel was excellent; it was about three blocks to Navy Pier, the Ohio Street Beach, and Lake Michigan, and about two blocks to the Chicago River. There is a grocery/store pharmacy called Dominick's across the street, so it's easy to buy drinks and snacks for your room, although that is almost unnecessary with the free hot breakfast served every morning and the nightly manager's cocktail party (even on weekends). Because my spouse has priority with Hilton, we were upgraded to a corner suite on the 17th floor (the highest floor), with excellent views of the river. The standard suites weren't quite as large as the corner suites (there's an odd window from their living area to the hotel atrium, so one could see in), but were still a great size, with a separate bedroom, bathroom, wet bar/microwave/fridge area, and living room with sofa bed and desk (the corner suites also had two chairs as part of the sofa grouping). There is an indoor pool and fitness center, as well as a gift shop, bar, and large lobby lounge area. There is no outdoor space at this hotel, which was the only drawback for me. A little sundeck, or other outdoor relaxation area (no matter how small) would have been welcome. The hotel spans an entire block, so it is possible to enter from multiple locations. There is an AMC movie theatre right next door, along with a bowling alley, PJ Clarke's restaurant, a Japanese restaurant, and a Walgreens pharmacy. There aren't many non-chain, unique restaurants in the immediate two block area, which was another slight drawback, but it was a quick walk to more cuisine-friendly streets. It is necessary to take two sets of elevators to reach the guest rooms. One set of elevators only travels three floors, from the street to the mezzanine (meeting) level to the sky (lobby) level. Then you must get off and walk to the other side of the hotel to catch another set of elevators that goes from floors 5 to 17. I understand that this set-up discourages non-guests from hanging out in the lobby and using the restrooms, but it is slightly inconvenient. I must say, though, that this hotel has the fastest elevators that I've seen in a long time! If you hesitated the slightest bit before trying to board, the doors closed and the elevator whisked away. (But that's probably why we almost never waited for an elevator, even being on the 17th floor during a busy summer weekend.) I would definitely stay here again, even considering all the other hotel options nearby.", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "terpnut", "ReviewID": "UR71426471", "Content": "As parents with two small children, we've always enjoyed the privacy of suites when travelling, and the Embassy Suites has delivered a consistently good stay whereever we can find one when we travel. This hotel has a very narrow, alley-like two-lane driveway so it was very congested when our taxi pulled up. Very awkward for those arriving by vehicle. One immediate downside of this particular hotel is that it is built on top of retail and thus you have to take an elevator to what is essentially a fifth floor lobby. Then, after checking in, you have to traverse the length of the hotel to get to the main hotel elevator banks. The bottom line is that there is lots of walking to get to your room. Not a problem if you are okay with walking, but if you are mobility challenged or want quick street-level access to your room, this is not the ideal hotel. Check-in was friendly, smooth and quick. Front desk offered some typical toiletries if you forgot something. This is one of the newer Embassy Suites so most hotel areas and rooms were in great condition. The main lobby has the expected huge atrium contributing to the nice airy, albeit noisy, feel typical of Embassy Suites. A few complaints in the room: 1. The bathroom shower rod was one of the new curved type that gives people more room, but the mount was broken so gravity made the curtain open whenever we showered. This led to lots of water spilling out onto the floor. 2. Walls are paper-thin and you could clearly hear conversations in the next room. Much worse than other hotels we've stayed at. 3. On the second of three days, housekeeping didn't replace enough towels or supplies. The other days were fine. 4. The single power outlet integrated with the desk lamp is too close to the switch so you can't plug in a flush-mounted power strip's plug. 5. Charging for internet access in this day and age is simply ridiculous. Breakfast was also typical of other Embassy Suites: it's free, the food is mediocre, and it gets crazy busy if you go late. To their credit, they keep the food and lines moving, kept it open longer than the stated 10 am cutoff, seating was plentiful and the service was quick and friendly. The manager's reception offered a decent selection of drinks and beers. Personally, I'd rather have free internet access than free breakfast or drinks. The best would be for Embassy Suites to offer all three! :-)", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cRan us out of town\u201d", "Author": "IndyMegan", "ReviewID": "UR70638281", "Content": "We left Chicago early on our last day of a weekend trip mainly to get away from this hotel. The night before, as I was trying to rest before late-night plans, I could hear a baby in the next room and a constant din from the hotel's atrium, and I went to a movie next door just to escape. I was disappointed to say the least. The service was great, room quality decent, crowds barely tolerable, double-elevator thing annoying, but the real problem is the atrium-style design. I'll never understand it. Every room overlooks the cacophonous atrium, as though every guest wants to hear what is going on in the atrium at all times. Walls were thin; heard babies crying on both sides at various points of the stay. On a sold-out weekend, the breakfast buffet was a madhouse. Waited 25 minutes for an omelet. The lobby is on an upper floor of the building, so you take on elevator to the lobby and then, across the atrium, another elevator to the room. The manager's reception, a daily perk, is good for the drinks but not worth the time for the snacks - nachos and cheese sauce, and sweet-potato fries, both mediocre at best. I didn't love the location. It's convenient to Navy Pier, which I didn't need, but families with kids must enjoy. It's also close to Michigan Avenue, but you have to climb steps to reach that street, because the hotel is set on one of Chicago's lower-level streets. A little confusing to reach, too. It wasn't a bad walk to Michigan Avenue, but it felt a little removed. The crowd is kid- and family-heavy, because it's a suite hotel. Be prepared for that. Lots of bodies crowding the driveway, buffet, elevators, etc. On the other hand, the atrium is very spacious with lots of couches and chairs. The pool is a lap pool. The hot tub is decent sized. Both are located off the atrium, not a rooftop or top-floor location like many hotels have. The rooms were okay, though a little on the small side. Hilton Suites, Omni, and Doubletree Suites are much larger. There's a window with shutters in the living room to the hallway outside, and since every floor is open to the atrium, light comes in through the shutters at all times. It was never fully dark in the living room. Also, the window makes it impossible to feel secluded in your room. The living room is in the front of the room, with small hallway to the back bedroom. The two-bed suites have double beds, not queens. There's a sink and an armoire in the bedroom. The bathroom is of decent size, but not nearly as big as those at Hilton Suites. On the plus side, the beds were cushy (but not Heavenly Bed cushy), and the AC worked great. The back bedroom was cool and pitch dark, for a good sleep. There were some positives. The service was very good. Buffet breakfast was more than satisfactory, with cooked-to-order omelet. The rest of the food is just okay, but you can eat a big breakfast that might cost $20 easily at a restaurant. There is a bike rack on the block, which we used overnight. A bike rental place at Navy Pier is close. I will avoid the Embassy Suites Lakefront in the future, but if a family needs the space and can take advantage of the good breakfast value, a stay here makes some sense.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cI am not sure if the other reviewers...\u201d", "Author": "travel54039", "ReviewID": "UR69690385", "Content": "I am not sure if the other reviewers actually stayed at this hotel.

Excellent location for several activities. Found a terrific deal on Hotwire for only $86/night. While my hubby loaded the luggage cart, my 11 yr old took care of the 3 yr old and I checked in. I went back to the loading area for the kids and my hubby took the car a few blocks away to park at Millennium Garages which is far cheaper than the hotel's daily parking rate of $42. After I loaded the cart the bellman insisted on bringing it up for me and told me to go ahead, up to the room and relax, which we did. Less than 10 minutes later the cart arrived with a smile and he helped me unload it as well. Two double beds which were quite comfy, AC worked VERY well and was able to be adjusted to the digital temp of your choice. Amazing view from the 11th floor of downtown and right over Columbus Drive. Water pressure in shower VERY good,hot water warmed quickly. Mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker in room allowed us to keep sandwich fixings and drinks for meals. The living room (a second, separate room) has another TV in it along with pull out sofa bed, end table and desk for computer. Note: WIFI in the room is not included - costs $14.95 per day or $3.95 for an hour. Free internet access is available on the hotel computers on the business floor, and printer is also available there for printing boarding passes or directions to things. One of the best breakfast buffets for a hotel is inside the Embassy Suites Lakefront. The buffet area includes scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, fried potatoes, yogurt, fruit, donuts, pastries and toast in addition to all the beverages (coffee, tea, 3 different juices, sodas, milk). There is also a \"cooked to order\" line where you can get omelettes made to your specifications as well as biscuits and gravy and other items that are on the buffet. Recommend going EARLY. Hours are 6:30-9:30 Mon-Fri and 7:30-10:30 Sat-Sun. Going early allows you to avoid lines AND to find a table to eat at. Of course you could always take a tray and go back to your room, which some people did do. In the evenings there is the Manager's Reception from 5:30-7:30pm. Two alcoholic drinks (one at a time though) and snacks. Snacks varied from popcorn/pretzel mix, trail mix, chips and salsa, sweet potato fries, small chicken nugget bites. Just depended on the day. And for this event, the line starts around 5:20pm and get there early. by 5:35pm you will have 15 people ahead of you. Bring your room key and money to tip the bartender. It's only certain types of alcohol obviously, well drinks, beers on tap, that sort of thing. No premium liquor. One line is for beer/wine/sodas and the other line is for mixed drinks. I had a Cosmo and Mai Tai just to give an idea. The lady in front of me got a tequila sunrise. No blended drinks. Indoor pool only - no diving, deepest is 4 1/2 feet which worked well for us and our kids. Hot tub great too. Pool towels provided. Workout room had 3 ellipticals, a few treadmills, some free weights and bench press. Bring your iPod headphones to use the TV on the elliptical! Restaurant on bottom floor of hotel - PJ Clarkes - a tad expensive but entrees are sharable especially between kids. Across the street from hotel is Dominicks - a grocery store.

The lady at the front desk was cheerful and was able to give me a room on the top floor with a view of Navy Pier ( after I had explained to her that there were no tall buildings where I come from so I liked being up high!). The front desk was also very helpful in helping me to find shopping and other near by attractions (FYI make sure you check out the grocey store across the street, it's a great little shop!) The managers recption was a welcome social experience after a hard days work and the staff and bar tenders were very prompt. I never once waited in a line. The morning breakfast was out of this world! Like nothing I had seen as a complimentary breakfast before, and again, never waited more than 5 minutes in line for a made to order omlette. On top of all of that the hotel was spotless, the room was quiet and it was like a home away from home. I will most definately be keeping my eye out for more Embassy Suites in my travels. My one and only complaint was the cost of High Speed in your room. I don't pay 14.95$ for high speed ultra at home for a month, nevermind a day.

There are 2 Embassy Suites in downtown Chicago very close to each other and I ultimately chose this one based on its 2008 remodel.

The curved shower curtain rod was so loose that the curtain wouldn't stay closed on either end; grout along the top of the tub appeared mold-ready; floor tile never sparkled; tub faucet was loose; light bulb was out for days; toilet paper dispenser placement required you to be a contortionist to access it; and the absence of any venting fogged up the entire suite during showers leaving visible moisture everywhere. And, (2) despite the ES website touting new flatscreens in the living room areas, we had an old tube TV; (3) we waited over an hour for an extra blanket and pillow to be delivered for the kids sleeping on the pull-out sofa; (4) our food tray from room service (dirty dishes) sat out in the hall for 2 days; (5) the chlorine was too strong in the tiny pool; (6) the bar sink faucet was loose; (7) creamer packets for coffee weren't always replaced; (8) and there were never enough hand towels (there are 3 separate in-room sinks).

We're a family of five, with three young boys. So finding a room for five is never easy, and the ESH chain are always accommodating.

The Good Things: - Big room, smart decoration throughout hotel, and good room facilities (microwave and fridge); - Friendly and helpful staff; - Good value for money - we paid about $300 for two nights' stay The Less Good Things - Really thin walls - we were unlucky that we had a noisy family next door. But even when their kids weren't shouting, you could hear everything. I think this is a pretty dire problem, especially if you sleep lightly. Everytime their room door shut, our room shook! - Breakfast was a bit disappointing - no fruit salad on the first morning (just oranges and bananas in a bowl), and a selection that generally compared badly with other ESHs we have stayed at. - No mugs at breakfast or in the room. Everything was polystyrine cups, which is not how I want my coffee in the morning - unless I am on a building site. And a lot of the cutlery was disposable plastic too. Not very environmentally friendly. But also generally just not very nice. - Huge Qs for the complimentary evening drinks - it took a good ten minutes to get a (small) drink from the bar. Which made the whole Managers Reception thing a bit of a drag. We didn't bother the second evening (when the Qs were just as bad). They really do need more bar staff for the rush hour.

It's a small tunnel with a single park lane and driveway off to the side which was often blocked with parked cars. The valets work hard to move things quickly but it's easy to get trapped in there for awhile. The room was very spacious!

The regular beds are very comfortable but the sofa bed is like every other-- very uncomfortable. Every room has a window looking out to the atrium with plantation shutters. The shutters don't keep out the light from the hallway so if you like your sleeping room dark, it will be best to nix the sofa bed and sleep in the bedroom.

My colleagues and I can't hear each other when calling from each other''s room, or calling from lobby to the rooms. I nicely pointed out this problem to the front desk supervisor ( no manager on duty at 8am in the morning), all she can say was \"sorry\" without ever acknowledge the problem. 2. Spoke with front desk twice trying to get some help on restaurant information reservation. The first night when I called, asked them to help me make a reservation about the Webber's restaurant. I was told that \"on a Wed night, you don't need reservation for a party of three - just walk-in you will get a table\". So my colleagues and I \"walked - in\", and it is a 45 mins wait. Apparently, nearly every night is like that. The second day, I tried to get some information about a good restaurant that I can take a client to. Again, they don't know anything, take a long time just to find out a phone number for a restaurant's (Shuler Steakhouse) which just across the street from them. 3. On my first day there, I tried to call the front desk by dialing \"0\". First try, maybe 15 rings, no one answered. Second try, after 10 rings, someone answered. I politely asked the girl if I should call a different extension to reach the front desk directly as I have been trying. The girl rudely said \" I answered now\" without even apologizing. 4. Although the room is pretty nice, the hall ways leading to my room smells bad. 5. On the plus side, they do have free breakfast in the morning, and free happy hour drinks in the evening. I stayed at many hotels. The hotel has good \"hardware\" - rooms, lobby, etc. What they absolutely lacking is management, and employee training.

I did not want to make a fuss so I let it go. We came back at 3 and our room was ready. The room was very spacious and nicely appointed, great view from the 17th floor. Housekeeping was efficient and never bothered us when we were in our room, we did however have to call down 4 times for extra towels, and after an hour they met us halfway down the hallway to get them. Breakfast was plentiful and lots of tasty variety. It can be crowded but the service staff was on top of turning tables around as other guests left. The manager's reception was better in the way of drinks than the Embassy in Rosemont, but the snacks were still a little lacking, 2 kinds of similar snack mix and tortilla chips just don't do it for me all the time. Pool and hot tub area were nice, a little small but perfectly functional for the space, it didnt feel crowded. Beds were comfortable and location was great in relation to Michigan Avenue, and only a couple of blocks from the Red Line station at Grand. Overall it was a good stay, and I would stay again.

The driveway was extremely congested upon our arrival. My son and I managed all of our luggage ourselves and went up the elevator to the hotel lobby to check in. We were placed in a room on the 6th floor, which is actually the first floor for rooms. Our room was clean and ready for us as requested.

All the other side dishes are the same as offered on the two buffet lines. Yes, it was crowded, but workable.

We were told the bell staff would bring our luggage. 45 minutes later, still no luggage. We called the bell stand and they said they would get it right away and the brought it right up -- I don't think the desk even notified the bell staff. After a nap we were getting ready to go back out and I noticed there isn't even a hair dryer---called to have a hairdryer brought up. 45 minutes later, no hair dryer. To avoid wasting even more or our vacation time dealing with this incompetent staff, I showered and left for Navy Pier with wet hair. After arriving back at the hotel, I called the front desk to bring the hair dryer and explained I had requested one earlier and it hadn't arrived --I asked to have it brought up, along with 2 glasses. The clerk didn't offer any apology for the earlier inconvenience and responded with a tone that made it seem like she was inconvenieced by the request. She just said, \"I'll tell someone\" About 30 minutes later the requested items arrived. This place is nothing special, but the staff just seems incompetent and unconcerned about guest satisfaction. The rooms are ok, but they just don't feel very clean. I'm in the hotel room right now and unfortunately, I have to stay here tonight, but never again.

I had tried to book the State St. Embassy Suites, where we stayed last year, but they would only let me use my Hilton points at this location. We arrived in the morning and pre-registered for our room where they reserved a lake view room for us. This made me happy as I am all about the view! The decor here is modern, which is not my taste , so it seems a little cold. The location is very good--close to Navy Pier and close to Michigan Ave, so we spent Friday afternoon shopping. There is also a great grocery store across the street that has everything you would need. When we came back, our room was ready. All was in order...looked clean and lake view as promised. The first night we took advantage of the free cocktail hour. Choices were limited, but hey, it's free. We walked to Volare' for a yummy Italian dinner, then came back to the hotel to watch tv. My girls (ages 14 and 11) were going to swim in the pool, but complained that it was too small and didn't go in. It looks more like a lap pool, but too crowded to ever swim laps. The furniture in the living area was in good condition, but not especially comfortable to relax in. The pull-out bed is extremely uncomfortable, so don't plan to sleep there unless you are a small child. Also, the walls are thin, which we discovered at 3am when our noisy neighbors rolled in. Saturday morning we got up and arrived at breakfast at 9am--the same time as the majority of the other guests at the hotel. They advise you to eat early, and we learned our lesson as lines were very long. The food was actually very good though, especially the omelettes. The day was spent seeing the Art Institute, Mary Poppins, then out to dinner. We arrived back at the room in time to watch the Sat. night fireworks (off Navy Pier) from our window. Very cool! Sunday was a beautiful day and we walked over to Millenium Park and hung out before catching the train home. Overall, our hotel stay was good. I love Chicago and always have fun here, but have stayed at better places. It is a great value though, especially if you take advantage of the free cocktails and breakfast. If you are debating between the two Embassy Suites, the State St. one would be my pick, although it is a little more expensive.

After reading some reviews I was a little hesitant, but I work in a hotel so I'm very aware of how picky/unreasonable people can be so I kept an open mind. I was travelling with my boyfriend and another couple (mid to late 20s). When we arrived at the hotel at 12pm, we were greeted by the friendly doormen and took the elevator up to the Sky Lobby. Dinah at the front desk checked us in with no problem or hesitation even though we were 4 hours early. She was so frienly and helpful and has excellent customer service skills. Next, we went up to our rooms on the 17th floor, using a different elevator than the one we took to the sky lobby. At first, this seemed a little annoying (because you couldn't take an elevator from your room all the way down to the main floor) but we eventually grew used to it. The room was GREAT!!!! Very spacious, clean, comfortable bed and furniture, 3 sinks in total, good sized televisions....really couldn't have asked for more. The wireless internet in the room is $15.00 and I didn't find it to be that slow. If you don't want to pay the fee, you can access the internet in the business center for free and it is open 24 hours a day. The managers reception is an awesome way to start off your night. It is from 5:30-7:30 every night. You can only order one alcoholic drink at a time but there is no limit to the number of drinks you can have within the 2 hours (unless they have to cut you off). They also provide chips, salsa, and some other munchies. The bar tenders were very friendly and will make pretty much any drink you want. The line was long at times, but I didn't find the wait to be bad at all. (P a t i e n c e ) Breakfast was great. They had a good variety and it was very convenient. The line for the omelette station can get a little long but if you just want a buffet style breakfast, they have a seperate cart for that where the line is very short (they only put it out when the hotel is over 50% occupancy). Overall, our stay was wonderful. I really can't complain about anything. I would definitely stay at this hotel again for several reasons: - Breakfast and Managers Reception - Great service from front desk, bar tenders, breakfast staff, and housekeeping attendant. - AWESOME location (only 2 blocks from the mag mile and close to Navy Pier) - Clean, spacious, and comfortable rooms. - Good and friendly atmosphere!

I have read other reviews others who had a bad experience, but I will say that ours (and most others I read) was great! We checked in on a Friday afternoon. It was easy to find the valet parking and they were great. I hate to pay that much for parking, but you would find that at any hotel in Chicago. We took the elevator to the Sky Lobby to check in and waited maybe 5 minutes till it was our turn, no more that that. The staff was very nice and courteous. They had 2 people waiting to check everyone in, but as soon a line starting forming behind us, another person jumped right in to check in other guests. Our room was on the 16th floor. It is an open lobby area all the way to the ceiling so if you are a little scared of heights, you might want to get a room on the lower floors. The room was a suite with two double beds in the bedroom area with a tv and a sofabed in the living room. It had a small dining area in the living area with a flat screen tv, a larger bathroom than you see in most hotels, and a small kitchenette with a sink, a small refrigerator, and microwave. The bed linens and towels were nice and clean, with very comfortable beds. It also had a large armoire in the bedroom and a large entertainment center, and a good size closet so there was plenty of storage. The managers reception was a nice bonus as well as the breakfeast in the morning. At the managers reception you are offered all the free drinks you can drink (alcohol and non-alcoholic). I read one review that said they were disappointed that they had to wait in line for a drink, but HELLO , its free and how many people are staying there? - You have to expect to wait a little, but we never waited for long. The breakfeast in the morning was more than I expected, you had everything from pancakes and sausge to made to order omlets, cereals, fruits, yogarts, breads, juices, coffee, milk, potatoes. It is included with the price of your room, so it is free to everyone. I would recommend coming either earlier or later (we were there early) because around 8 am to 9 it is busy. The consierge was nice and very helpful. The only slightly negative thing I would say was the size of the pool. It is small (long, but not very wide), but there were never too many kids and ours had a great time. Plus, they had stacks of towels, so you didn't have to worry about bringing them from your room or running out by the pool.

It was only two blocks walk to Michigan Ave. and 4 blocks walk to the pier.

Location of the hotel is good, close to Navy Pier and Magnificent Mile but yet relatively quiet. I (single traveler) had a corner room in 13th floor. No noise from the atrium to this particular room, probably because it is located somewhat further away from atrium than \u00e2\u20ac\u0153regular rooms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Room has certainly large enough for my purposes, big living room and a separate sleeping room. Room was spotless and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any scratches or other marks from previous usage, so no complains about it. Also other parts of the hotel were in very good shape. Kitchenette consisted of small fridge and a microwave oven. Room had quite nice views towards Chicago river, lake was also well visible as was Sears Tower. LAN access provided with ~10$/day, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice any WLAN. One very very minor issue though: one of two TVs in the room was not LCD (they advertise two LCDs in a room) but a old-style \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tube\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TV. Hotel offered free breakfast and a manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reception in the evening. Latter offered very little to eat (just some snacks), but plenty to drink (free beer, wine and booze) for two hours. Breakfast was, um, not that well suited for European taste but otherwise offered quite many different options. I never had to wait for an elevator more than 30 seconds or so, thus no problems for me regarding that issue (unlike some other reviewers). Then again, I left the hotel always latest at 8:15am, so avoided the real morning rush hour. Typical customers seemed to be families and there were really lots of them, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really hear any special noise (no kids running around corridors etc).

To begin, we pulled up on Columbus Ave. to check in because we didn't see the valet and self park were on Illinois. No big deal, still had to figure out how to get to the check in desk which is on another floor, so I had to ask to find out how to get there. When I got to the registration desk there was one employee checking in a guest. I was next in line and even though I walked up at the contract printout time still stood there over 8 minutes before a second employee showed up from the back. Even when she did come up, she fiddled around by the first employee for a minute or two then seemed like she decided she could check me in. She didn't greet me, no \"Hello\", and no conversation. I had booked a more expensive rate so that my kids would each get an Olympic panda bear, but because she didn't give them to me I figured they were in the room. I honestly thought she would snap at me if I asked about them. The bears weren't in the room and I had to go back down and get in line, again over five minutes, to let them know I never received my bears. Found valet and checked our luggage pointing out that we had already checked in. (I figured it worked out well because our luggage would get delivered that much faster, so I was doing a little better after check in.) After an HOUR AND A HALF I called down to the bellman's desk to see where our luggage was. There was no answer, so I left a message. Never was replied to. My husband had to go back down to the ground level to find our luggage and have it brought up. All said and done, it took TWO hours before we got our luggage. I booked one of the over sized corner suites and the room was very clean. There was plenty of room for us but the views were nothing to write home about. We had no problem with housekeeping and any time we had any needs or questions they were very friendly. My husband went out to check out the facility and stopped by the concierge desk to ask a couple of questions about dinner reservations. After waiting over five minutes he stepped over to registration and asked when someone would be back. That's when we found out they send their concierge home before 6PM! And they don't even put a sign up saying they are gone and to go to registration, which again you'll probably have a wait for because they seem to only let one employee out at a time even though they are now handling check in and concierge questions. Their pool is really narrow and every time we tried to go swimming there were a ton of kids running, splashing everyone, even those on deck, and some even unsupervised. The employees don't seem to check the area at all except for towels. The pool hours are great but the really need to add an adults only time before and after their normal hours so the adults can get in laps or enjoy a peaceful hot tub. Our kids our nine and ten, and even they didn't enjoy how unruly the pool was, they didn't even get in the first time we went to the pool. Everyone we dealt with in room service was super friendly and helpful, which was a blessing because we didn't want to leave the room. It actually changed our mood to have to do something on the Sky Level. When we would go out to dinner or shopping we didn't want to come back to the hotel. We would have just moved to our normal hotel, but the Embassy was going to charge us for the whole stay, so it wasn't worth it.

I found the service to be consistently very good at this hotel. From the valets to the front desk to the housekeeping staff. Everyone was friendly and approachable. The lobby is not on the ground level, it is on the sky level, so this was a bit odd. And you had to go to a separate set of elevators to get to your room (which was a pain when you entered and exited the hotel, but it was a minor inconvenience, plus, it added a layer of security which is important in a place like Chicago. The rooms are all suites, so you have a living room, a tiny \"kitchenette\" area with a fridge, sink and microwave, and a bedroom. The room was pretty clean. No major complaints. The bath was nice. The bed was comfy. The towels had that \"fresh scent\" smell like when they come out of the dryer...Mmmmm. We had a lakeview room, but the view isn't great. There are several other buildings blocking your view, but a partial view is better than no view. All guests are treated to a full breakfast and nightly cocktails (free). They have a \"cook to order\" counter where they make your eggs fresh, and they dole out goodies like bacon, sausage or biscuits and gravy. They also have a buffet-style breakfast in the dining area, if you are in a hurry. I found the breakfast to be a great added value. This hotel is pricey, and if you bring your whole family (which lots of people did), this can cut costs dramatically on trying to eat out downtown Chicago. The evening cocktails session was nice for adults to relax in the lobby and have snack and mingle. It was well attended each night I was there. The area around the hotel is great, and relatively safe for Chicago. We walked to Navy Pier and took taxis to Water Tower Place and the John Hancock Building for under $10 (with 2 people). There is a Dominick's grocery chain right across the street (full size) and a high-end grocery on the back side of the building (FABULOUS deli!). Also, a Walgreen's attached to the backside. We were there for almost four days, so we bought a few groceries for the room fridge. The only complaints I had were that the air conditioning did not cool the bedroom, as well as I would have liked at night. And the internet service was not very fast.

Good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c room layout was good, we had a corner suite with a view of Lake Michigan, fridge, microwave, flat screen TV in bedroom, clean, comfortable bed, plenty of space for the family to spread out, the breakfast food was very good and the drinks at the reception were also good (especially considering it is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153included\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd amenity), check-in was easy and the staff was friendly and helpful Needs Improvement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c breakfast planning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the large family crowd, some items ran out before the end of breakfast each day, one night the reception had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153noodle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd type dish, but mostly the same chips/salsa and bar mix \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I have seen a much better variety of snacks at other ES properties, housekeeping \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one day we came back after 6pm and the room was not serviced, a call to the front desk had it fixed while we were at dinner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also they did not observe the if it is on the floor please change it policy, no Disney Channel (kids only gripe) Location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ok walking distance to subway, easy walking distance to Navy Pier, Michigan Ave, Tips \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you do drive avoid the hotel garage, we parked at the Navy Pier (a few blocks walk) for less than half the price per day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially since we did not use our car again till we left Overall a very good stay and what I expect from an ES property. We would probably stay here again next time in Chicago as a family.", "Date": "March 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cover priced\u201d", "Author": "gringoca", "ReviewID": "UR14189380", "Content": "We've stayed at 2 Embassy Suites in 2 different cities.

It was right next door to an entertainment complex with a big cinema and bowling alley/bar, plus right across the street from a grocery store for picking up fruits and snacks that can be difficult to find when staying in a downtown area. The hotel was a 3-4 block walk from Navy Pier, and close to the popular Dick's Last Resort restaurant on the water where the waiters insult you purposely. It was also only 2-3 blocks from Michigan Avenue shopping and dining--very easy walk. I also walked to the Art Museum and Millenium Park, although these locations weren't terribly close--I'd say 10 blocks south. Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. The location was excellent, the neighborhood was safe with a booming condo population of professionals moving in all around it, and plenty of entertainment and food options were within walking distance. One other thing, if you want to hop on the train, there is a nearby station about 1-2 blocks away. Easy to take the train south or north to Wrigley Field to catch a Cubs game.

My experience here totally changed my mind about ES. We arrived in the middle of the heat wave to cordial bellmen and wonderful front desk folks. Since we were staying 8 days, we figured we'd ask for a corner room on an upper floor for a view & see if they'd comply. (We booked through a special convention service for approx. $200 per night - not especially cheap, but decent given what was going on during the time we were there.)The convention was soon to start and the Chicago Marathon was the next weekend; they were quite full, but willingly accomodated us. Our windows looked out on the Wrigley & Tribune buildings along with partial lake and river views. Our room was clean and comfortable - the standard ES with a sitting room, fold-out sleeper bed, small kitchenette with mini-frig, & comfortable king bed. Because we had a corner room, I think we had a bit more space than some of our friends who had standard hall rooms. Complimentary hot breakfast was very good = just quite crowded unless you went very early. The swimming pool was small for the size of the hotel, but we used it every day with our 2 kids and there were never more than 6 people including us in it, so it was fine. Overall pluses: FABULOUS LOCATION! Less than 2 blocks from the river, a couple blocks from Navy Pier, 2 blocks from Michigan Avenue, walking distance to Millenium Park. Nice staff - went out of their way to be helpful. Also - one of the only hotels that we've stayed in that allowed kids in the hot tub; a definite plus for our girls. Areas that were just ok: Rooms could use a bit more lighting - it tended to be rather dark. Water pressure in the shower was really low (we were on the 12th floor). Also, for the price of the rooms, one would expect internet to be included in the cost - it was an additional charge. However, there is a business center with 3 computers that you can use for free. Overall, I'd stay there again in a moment - especially with our kids ages 3 and 6. It's very family friendly and our experience was great.

There was also a second TV, table, mini-fridge and microwave. There are also laundry facilities available. Breakfast was crowded only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday; weekdays were not bad at all. The evening reception had short lines (5 min. or so) for drinks; that's the price you pay for free I guess, we only went a couple of times. The pool is quite small -- it's like one lap of a lap pool.

The rate was $50-100 less than a standard (amenity-less) room at all the nearby major chains, so it was a no-brainer to stay here.

Obviously, traveling with such a group is never going to be seamless, but we were pretty happy with the room (12th fl, great view south towards the AON Center). It was a \"King Suite\", so my wife and I and the baby slept in the King, with the two kids on the sofa bed in the front room. Besides the two-room setup with fridge and microwave, another huge plus for staying here with kids is that there's a Dominick's grocery store directly across the street (and FYI, your Safeway card seems to work there). That saved us the first night when everyone was too tired to endure a dinner outing and we bought dinner and other supplies from there. Friday morning's free breakfast was a total fiasco. The line was about 20 minutes or more to get your food, seats were hard to come by, and they kept on running out of things like plates and silverware. It was obvious that the crowd was 90% families, which obviously slows things down. There wasn't any obvious way to help the situation (other than maybe keeping supplies filled so that people aren't disrupting the flow by barging into another line to get a fork). It really started our day off on a sour note. Inexplicably, I never saw the lines get out of hand on Saturday morning though. My guess is that so many people had been traumatized by Friday's scene that they either sent one family member down to fill a tray for the rest (as we did) or they just went to Dominick's or some other place for breakfast. Another drawback is the fact that you need to take an elevator from street level up to the 5th-floor \"Sky Lobby\" and a second one up to your room. Just a pain when you're going back and forth (e.g. if you're playing the parking meter game, see below). Parking charges are always punitive in downtown hotels, and this one is no exception. $39/night to valet park, $32 to self-park. We managed to get through our two nights with only about $25 in charges (a $53 savings). There are meters immediately south of the hotel and to the east on that same block (between the Sheraton and Illinois Ave). They run 9 am to 9 pm, so if you get a spot at night, you don't have to get up at dawn to move it. The lot which is located southwest across the intersection of Illinois and Columbus from the hotel charges $22 for 24 hours (with, obviously, no in and out priveleges), so we did use that for a long stint that first night. Another parking location that can be attempted is the lowest of the 3 levels of Wacker Drive, just south of the Chicago river. The meters are 7am - 7 pm, though, and there are quite a few homeless people living down there, so I can't vouch for the security of it. I'd definitely park there during the day (and I did), but chickened out for the overnight stint. Getting back to the hotel itself, it's a good choice for its access to Grant Park and Millenium Park (less than a mile to the South), Michigan Ave (a couple of blocks east), Navy Pier (if that's your bag) and some metered parking. If you're an early riser, you shouldn't experience the problems with the breakfast traffic. Staff were all fine, breakfast is above average for a free one.

It is very narrow and was extraordinarily crowded at all times of the day with kids. There would have been no possibility of swimming a lap across the pool at anytime during President's Day week-end. There were at least 25 kids in the pool, and 8 in the hottub - and the comfortable capacity for the whole place would be about 2 or 3 families. Second, sides of the pool were grossly grimy. While I had to be in the pool with my daughter, I could hardly stand it with how dirty it was. My last straw was when I saw the same gross thing floating by the side of the pool that I'd seen the day before. Ewww! #2) The ES is pretty expensive. We reserved 3 months ahead, and so got the bargain rate of $170/night. That's a LOT to pay for a night. The parking is $32/day, with no other safe options nearby.

If you don't want to wait in line for breakfast (like 10-15 minutes), simply wake up earlier. You can always skip the line and get bagels, juice, cereal, etc. with no wait. Don't stay at the Embassy Suites expecting luxurious surroundings, especially when there's an Intercontinental, Ritz and Peninsula within a mile. Yes, noise carries quite well in the building, and there are hotels closer to the heart of the action. However, you get breakfast taken care of every day, can have a couple pops in the afternoon, and the room has two TV's so the kids are happy. Having some patience will definitely help. However, chances are if you are traveling to the big city with kids, you probably already have enough to enjoy your stay here.", "Date": "December 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eureka, California", "Title": "\u201cEmbassy during the week great\u201d", "Author": "Lecats", "ReviewID": "UR4146492", "Content": "I had an extended stay at this Embassy.

Fairly quiet (if you are high up) except for the emergency vehicle sirens. However, the invasion of children started on Friday nights. Lots of noise and long lines at breakfast and reception. With the atrium the noise rose so it is best to be up on a high floor. There is a washer and dryer on floors 10 & 14 for those longer stays ($1.50 each). However, the walls are paper thin. Speaking, radio, TV and children are very noticable from the next room. Rooms in the corners should be quieter. Also, the beds are hard (at least on floor 13).", "Date": "November 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Paul", "Title": "\u201cnot the finest of the Embassy Suites\u201d", "Author": "aroundtown47", "ReviewID": "UR4089931", "Content": "There were no real problems with this hotel it was merely a disappointment.

Won a bid of $65 each for 2 rooms on Priceline - what a steal! Our family of 4 (two boys 8 & 11) were very satisfied with the accommodations and service, especially given the price, since the cheapest rate offered on the web was $199. We arrived at 1:00, but were told our rooms weren't ready since check-in is at 4. No problem, we wanted to have lunch so we walked to Navy Pier (not as close as I had thought but a nice day for a walk nonetheless) and then over to lunch at Dick's Last Resort on the North Pier. We returned to the hotel at 3:30 and were given 2 adjacent rooms, having requested such. Both rooms were the typical Embassy suite style - separate bedroom, fold-out couch in living room (on the 10th floor) - each bedroom had two double beds. I decided that a King bed would be nicer for hubby & I, so returned to the front desk to ask to be changed, which was kindly accommodated (on the 12th floor). No mention of Priceline either time. Unfortunately when I exchanged room keys, the boys and my husband, waiting in one of the suites, had left some luggage in the other suite. So when I returned with the new room assignment, we had no keys to get in the other room. I found a maid a few doors down and explained. She called the front desk to confirm my story (can't just be letting people into strange rooms you know.) When confirmed the front desk said that security had to let us in and they would be right up. After waiting a few minutes, the maid kindly let me in herself so we wouldn't have to wait longer. Rooms were a contemporary design with modern furniture in nice shape. Rooms were pleasant to look at and comfortable although it was weird that the rooms had a window with shutters looking out onto the hall, but we just closed them. The view not much to look at, not a problem. Nice that the bedroom window opened to let air in. Room was absolutely sound-proof - didn't hear a sound from any other room or floor (except occasional siren outside.) Internet connection was woefully slow so we weren't able to use that - didn't bring it to the hotels attention since we weren't in the room for that much time. At 5:30 we mosied down for free drinks at happy hour and relaxed while the kids swam. Hot tub and pool are nothing fancy - basically a lap pool, but we pretty much had it to ourselves, there was one other family in the pool room. The only minor complaint was that the bartender would only let you take one drink at a time, so hubby and I had to go to bar together or one of us made two trips - silly. But a good deal regardless. There was nachos, cheese sauce and nuts for snacks. No long lines at the bar or for food. We dined at PJ Clarkes in the hotel which we enjoyed - having left the kids at the room checking in via cell phone. Free breakfast the next day was also very good. We arrived at 8:00ish having read horror stories on tripadvisor.com about dreadfully long lines after 9:00. Since it was Sunday there was made-to-order omelets, as well as bacon, sausage, cereal, donuts, juices, fruit, etc. We checked out at 9:30 and there still was no waiting line at breakfast that we had been warned about. Being a weekend, I was surprised that it wasn't busier. Self-parking was $32. Would stay here again, especially at this price given the free happy hour and breakfast - what a great deal. Would be fun to do a \"girl friends\" trip here. Overall a very nice stay, kids really enjoyed having a suite all to themselves.", "Date": "October 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Family Place\u201d", "Author": "PR", "ReviewID": "UR4053836", "Content": "Because we didn't get much of a family vacation, I told my boys that their first 3 day holiday we would book a trip where ever American had a netsaver. Well, last weekend the Netsaver from Dallas to Chicago was $139. We booked the Lakeshore Embassy suites ($279 a night). First, Chicago is a great place to take the family. There were tons to do. The hotel's location is so-so. It is great if you are interested in the Navy Pier and things on that side of town. You can walk to Navy Pier in 5 minutes. We did that on Saturday. It is quite a ways (about 2.5 miles) from the Museums. We bought a CTA pass that will take you on any train or bus in town. It was $9 a piece for a 2 day pass, but it sure saved on cab fares. The only problem is that the main line (the red line) is about 5 blocks from the hotel. That would not be a big deal unless the weather is bad, which it was on Sunday and Monday. So, if you want a hotel closer to the line, you might look somewhere else. Anyway, we did the Bears game on Sunday...a great way to experience true Chicago. We ate at the typical pizza joints (Gino's East and Giadarnos sp?). The hotel itself is really nice. Getting into it is a little cumbersome. You go into a small lobby on the street level where the bellmen are then take an elevator to the Sky Lobby located on the 6th floor. Then check in. The main lobby is huge and very open with lots of windows. In the main lobby you have the manager's reception at night (mixed drinks, beer, wine, sodas, snacks) and breakfast in the a.m. Breakfast was quite good (omlette station, pancakes, egss, bacon, sausage, hash browns, and assorted pastries and breads). There was a pool and hot tub, but according to my boys (who are like polar bears) the pool was too cold and the hot tub too hot. The rooms are typical Embassy Suite rooms. We booked a corner suite, which was great. We had a view of the lake, which was really nice. My only criticism is the walls are very thin. We could hear our neighbor's radio as well as other entertaining sounds at different points during the night and I am sure they could hear our boys early in the morning. The first night the hotel was packed, but with the Sox playing in the World Series I expected it. So the lines at the happy hour and breakfast were long. The next night and morning were much better. Let me know if you have any questions, but overall a great trip and good hotel.", "Date": "October 26, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Embassy Suites Hotel Chicago Downtown Lakefront", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d223061-Reviews-Embassy_Suites_Hotel_Chicago_Downtown_Lakefront-Chicago_Illinois.html", "Price": "$167 - $426*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">511 North Columbus Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Chicago</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">60611</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "223061", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f9/64/f9648e3843adc960665472c40f5105c85large.jpg"}}
