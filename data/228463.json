The room was spotless, and cleaned perfectly every day. The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in, and the pillows were exactly the right size. I hate huge pillows that crank your neck too high up in the sky. The breakfast buffet had everything I can think of to eat at breakfast, and then some. We had a huge breakie every day and then were good to go for hours and hours. The staff at the hotel were exceptional: friendly, helpful, pleasant, and went out of their way to make sure we had a wonderful stay. Every night I would get hot water from the little ground floor bar to make my herbal tea, and the lovely girl there insisted we didn't need to pay anything. (but I gave her a tip, of course!) The beach was right across the road and I had great swims every day. BEAUTIFUL beach!!! White sand for many kilometers, bars at intervals where my husband who doesn't like to stretch out in the sun like I do could repair for \"cervezas\". Usually we don't ever go back to the same place because we like to travel to different countries and different parts of these countries, but we will definitely be back there next year, since there are so many things in Barcelona we didn't have the time to do. And we will DEFINITELY be back at this hotel. Also, it is right on bus route #41 which took us downtown very cheaply. Actually, we went all over on the buses which was great because we got to meet many local people. (Talking is one of my favourite activities as anyone who has met me for 6.4 seconds realizes - GRIN - so that is why I speak English, French, and Spanish - more opportunities to TALK!) Oh, I must mention what a SAFE city Barcelona is. Over 3 million people, and outside our hotel single women were out jogging and rollerblading at 10:30 p.m. and much later. Try doing THAT in a city of that size anywhere else in the world. When I set off to do some things on my own one day, and needed to transfer to a different bus, the bus driver and all the other passengers had great conversations to help me out. The language spoken is Catalan, and if I only spoke Spanish, I would have been totally lost, but my French allowed me to figure out what they were saying pretty much all of the time, and they didn't give up till I did: much pointing and as long as you can do derecha (right) and izquierda (left), it's doable!

Perhaps the management has changed since, as this time my experience is nothing short of an irritating nightmare.

After complaining I wanted to pick another room for one night, until we can move to the previously chosen side. The receptionist said that he's not refunding the difference between the room prices because he offered a junior suit and it's my problem that i'm not taking it. Upon complaining that I indicated exactly which suit I want and that it's not just any, he said he wasn't on duty that day and I should wait and come back the following day. Upon changing suits the next day I found that the new has thick layers of dust all over on the furniture and flying around in the sunshine. Within minutes my laptop screen needed wiping. Upon complaining at the reception, the receptionist (another person, but equally bright) cheerfully explained that it is becuase of the blanket in the room. With 3 degrees celsius I was very suprised at her shock when I suggested that perhaps they should wash the blankets now and then. As a plus point the phone wasn't giving an external line. After alerting the reception, I had to call them to dial numbers for me all day (one person came by to look at the phone by the afternoon, but did not fix it). By the last confcall I needed to attend the number I gave could not be reached from the reception, to which the receptionist told me i \"can come down and use the coin pay phone in the lobby\" to attend the internal conference call of my company.

On the first morning; I and my husband entered the main room and picked up a plate but we were stopped by a rude waiter.We put down our plates and left, in fact the hotel management had divided the rooms for groups, but there was no sign anywhere showing it, you had to guess where your eating location was :) by searching, we had found the room which was reserved for our group. While we were eating, we heard a real big argument between our tour guide and a waitress. The reason of the argument was this : even they had divided the rooms; the breakfast service was'nt full in all the rooms, half of the assortments were missing in our group's room and no person was there for serving or checking our needs. Also, they were not letting people to enter the main room to pick something to eat or drink. On top of all, one of the service person kept shouting at our tour guide and touching his arm with anger.

However do be careful if booking taxis through them. We took a taxi up town and were charged almost 19 euros. We were amazed when we took the return journey and it cost less than six!!! Check the rate when you are picked up- the meter should be on about 2 euros at pick-up or you are about to be ripped off. As with all the hotels breakfast is expensive, so take a short walk to the left and eat at one of the perfectly fine small cafes for half the price and less. Mar Bella beach is a short stroll across the dual carriageway, you wont need a swim suit! We have been in the sea in December twice here- it is bracing but a great experience.
