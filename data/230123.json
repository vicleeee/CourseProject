The hotel was hard to find. It's in an alley behind a church on Dam Square, and there are no signs on the main streets to point you in the right direction. Once we found it, we had mixed feelings. The proximity to Dam Square, the main train station, and the tram lines was excellent. The location in the alley was a little weird since it's right across from a \"coffeeshop\" and there was always a steady stream of young people smoking pot in the street outside the shop. The hotel is in an old building, and the atmosphere inside is a little run down. We booked a room for two people weeks before the trip, but at check-in were told that a single room for one person was reserved. They were able to accomodate us and give us a room for two, but it was irritating. We booked, confirmed and re-confirmed but it was still wrong. The room was tiny with 2 twins smushed together. The only window was mounted near the ceiling and we had to use a stick with a hook to open or close it. The bathroom was half the size of my closet at home. There was a shower, but it was so tiny you could hardly turn around in it. I'll be honest. Our first impression was that it was a dump. On closer inspection, however, the room was indeed clean and the mattresses were incredibly comfortable. After the initial shock wore off, we were determined to make the best of it, especially since it was only for 3 nights. If you're looking for a certain level of European charm or space, this is not the hotel for you. But if you're looking for a clean room with comfortable bed near Dam Square and you aren't turned off by something on the lines of a private hostel room, you'll be happy here. The staff was friendly and helpful, and for that we were thankful. I can't say that I'd recommend this hotel to friends or family, but I would recommend it to young people looking to stay near Dam Square and the train station who don't plan to spend much time in their room and aren't hung up on luxury or amenities.", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Quiet, Safe, Clean, Reasonable Price - Now Best Western\u201d", "Author": "DileepB", "ReviewID": "UR88951071", "Content": "We spent 3 nights there and have no complaints.

Arriving at Schipol airport we came through arrivals and walked straight to the railway station just follow the signs, to take the train to Amsterdam Central, really easy, trains run every 20 mins, you get your tickets from a yellow ticket machine (3 euros and 60 cents one way) then the train journey takes about 15 mins. When you exit the railway station be aware of the trams and of course the bicycles which are everywhere. We walked from the station to the hotel which took about 10 to 15 mins with cases, just head to Dam Square, the hotel is easy to find. On arrival we were checked in really quickly by nice staff and then shown to the lift to take us to the floor our room was on. I had requested a quiet room on a high floor with 3 single beds and this was just what we got. The room was clean and of a good size with heating and duvets on the extra long beds rather than sheets, there was coffee making facilities, tv and a nice size bathroom with a walk in corner shower and soft towels, there was also a hairdryer. This is the cleanest bathroom i have seen in any hotel i have stayed in. The room rate included breakfast in the lovely breakfast room which was never busy but always had plenty of food on offer, you had a choice of tea or coffee which was brought to your table, you then served yourself to cereals, fruit juices, cold meats, cheeses, yogurts,rolls, toast and fresh fruit, a great leisurely start to the day without feeling you had to rush. There was also a bar in the foyer of the hotel, not that we used it as there is so many bars to choose from just outside the hotel especially St Pauls bar and restaurant which is 2 doors away from the hotel, very relaxed atmosphere with nice food. The other bar and restaurant i must recommend is one we found close to the red light district called Het Karbeel in a street called Warmoesstratt, an excellent find with attentive staff and a wonderful menu, we ate here two evenings out of the three we were in Amsterdam. The cheese fondue was mouth watering as a starter and the king prawn was too die for. Both nights we spent over four hours eating our meal, nothing was rushed and we felt totally relaxed, the glass of Port at the end of the meal was the icing on the cake. This was a great city break, nice hotel in a central location just what you need without having to spend a fortune.

Also, we arrived at 1pm and the room was already ready for us.Clean room, nice bed, small tv with remote but tv wasnt really important, there is a phone with answering machine, window to the front street but we didnt hear noise at night or morning because its a quiet street, nice bathroom with window to the front street too, a nice shower but water pressure was a bit weak, they offered coffee and tea and we could make them in the room. there is an elevator, the corridors are also clean.For breakfast they had diferent types of bread, corn flakes, boiled eggs, youghurt, coffee, tea, cheese, etc.. but it could be a lot better. Dont expect a big breakfast. Staff was nice, all of them. i noticed that some of the rooms didnt have a window facing the front street, but they had a window facing an inside terrace instead, wich wasnt ok for me. if i had stayed in one of those rooms i would probably be complaining here, instead of saying that as long as you get a room similar to the one we got, you will be happy.
