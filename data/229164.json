As you will have gathered from the other reviews, the location of this hotel is perfect for getting to all the main attractions and galleries of Amsterdam on foot. The price you pay for this convenience is noise and not exactly the most picturesque position in this beautiful city. Yes, the hotel is on the wonderful Prinsengracht canal, but it's also on a terribly busy corner and opposite a chip shop and a kebab shop on the main drag down to Leidesplein. If you want a romantic, quiet retreat on a canal, this definitely isn't it. If you want to be in the heart of the action though, give it a whirl. Our room overlooked the main street and it was very noisy, (probably stoned) mayhem well into the early hours. The room also had no air-con, so we had the fan provided right next to the bed just to stay semi-cool (it was way too noisy to have the window open...). The rooms aren't comparable with other 4 star hotels I've stayed in: they are more akin to 3 star, but perfectly comfortable (except for the air con). But the corridors etc are a real let down here - very poor stairwells that have a dark, depressing institutionalised feel about them. We did find the reception staff very friendly and efficient, so plus points there. However, the maid service was just bizarre: we literally had someone hanging around outside our door waiting for us to leave for breakfast each day! This wasn't late, by the way - it was around 8:00-8:30am. It happened for 3 days on the trot: there they were waiting for us to leave, and then they would be inside the room before we'd even reached the stairs! It was kind of comical, kind of creepy. If I were in Amsterdam again for 1 night, I'd consider this place for its convenience. But for a longer stay, I'd be seeking somewhere a bit quieter. Note: I had to give this hotel a 'very good' review, as 'average' would have been too mean. In reality, it's somewhere between the two - i.e. just a plain old 'good'.

The third disappointment was the isolation: our bed was placed against a wall from which you could hear all details of the neighbours' bathroom.

They charged us hourly and it wasn't nearly as fast or reliable as we were used to in other hotels. (We travel with Magic Jack so we can call home for free, but the Internet wasn't fast enough to support it.) 2. We had a double room.

Oh yeah, and the \"balcony with a view\" was 30cm by 80cm - not even big enough to fit the broken chair on. The two nice factors were the view was pleasant (but you could get it anywhere else in amsterdam) and the staff were friendly, oh and it was only about 150m from Anne Franks House.

We booked through hotelbook.com and paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac330 euros in total for a standard double room. We flew into Schipol airport and caught the train to Central Station \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.10 / person. On arrival we caught a tram (1, 2 or 5 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.60 / person - pay the conductor at the back of the tram) to Prisengracht. the stop is very handy as it's right outside the hotel. The hotel from the outside looks lovely. We checked in no problems and our room was ready for us at 11:30am which was very handy. We had requested a canal view room which we got. The room we stayed in was 305. It was average in size and to be honest I felt a little disappointed when we entered. The room in general is OK but needs a bit of decorating. The layout was also unusual with the sink area being in the actual room. The room consisted of a double bed, which was very comfy with fab pillows the best I have ever had in a hotel, desk, table & chair, flat screen TV, phone, tea & coffee making facilities, minibar, wardrobe - not much drawer space. The bathroom was tiny with a loilet and shower (with curtain) although it was clean. The shower area could do with a reburbish. Breakfast was typically dutch, bread, cheese, meats, eggs, cakes, cereals, jams, yogurts etc. We only made breakfast once but found the variety very good. It is served 8:30am - 10:30am on weekends and 7:30am - 9:30am on weekdays. You could also have breakfast served in your room for an additional \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 / person. Although there was some noise from Trams etc. this never bothered us once and we had no problems sleeping. The location of this hotel is fantastic for the Leidsplein area (1 min walk). there are great bars and restaurants around here. The piano bar is a lot of fun although drinks are pricey. The walk to Dam sqaure is about 20 mins and 30mins to the red light district. The geneal area surrounding the hotel is very busy. There is a bar in the basement which again we only used once to meet some friends and we the only ones in there, but it is nice. there are also free coffee and teas in there for residents. Safety deposit boxes are available behind reception free of charge, just don't lose the key as they will charge you \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500. There is also a luggage storage room. An Internet PC is available in reception at a charge. You are required to hand in your room key when you leave the hotel and collect it when you return. Just one thing to note: although it had no impact on us as we don't partake there is a no soft / hard drug policy in the hotel and fines in place if found in breach. Overall we enjoyed our stay and if you can get a good price then it's worth staying there. I wouldn't pay more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac110 / night for a standard room though. Clare P.S.

The Penthouse is a 4.5 star experience on any US traveler's scale, jaw-dropping view, huge room, great king bed, an awesome view, cool AC, plasma TV, panoramic view of city, decent bathroom and \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 did I mention the view?!?

The staff had that aloof Euro attitude, but if you engaged them with a smile they were very helpful and went the extra mile to help recover lost luggage from KLM. The location is another big plus for this hotel! Located close to the Museum district and away from the crowded Dam square and packed Central station area, it is just steps away from the very cool and active Leidseplein area. A short walk and you are surrounded by restaurants, bars, coffee shops (I Highly recommend the Dolphins) and with a few more steps you can find less crowded local hangouts. Lots of shopping of all kinds and a few art galleries round out an excellent area from which to explore Amsterdam. Bonus: the hotel is next to the main Tram system for a quick, albeit crowded, ride to Central station and other Amsterdam destinations. The staff even cut us a deal on a 1 night return stay in the Penthouse at the regular room rate at the end of our vacation! $150 Euro for the Penthouse was our best bargain of the entire 3 week trip.

We were there from sunday to wednesday before easter - days I know to be quiet in Amsterdam, so we got a great room at a low price: just \u00e2\u201a\u00ac134 for a huge double with a lounge-corner by the huge corner bay-window overlooking Prinsengracht and Leidsestraat. There's a tramstop for lines 1, 2 and 5 (from Centraal Station) right outside (stop called \"Prinsengracht\") The location very close by Leidseplein and walkingdistance (even for lazy me) to the the museums, is really fantastic! The room was clean and the decor tasteful - it's really spacious, which is unusual for old houses in Amsterdam!! It has an unbelievable view of the canal, and a really nice, and big bathroom (2 sinks and a tub). The room was located on the 3rd floor, so we were high enough up to also have a view over some of the roofs, (nice feeling of space and air), and to be able to have the window open, without being overwhelmed by the buzzing street below. There's a kettle in the room, and complimentary coffee/tea. Also a fridge-minibar (sodas, beer, alcohol), which we just took out, and used the fridge for our own drinks and food, bought at the local supermarket at a fraction of the price. Breakfast is included, and the buffet is continental - they don't say that anywhere, which unfortunately is probably on purpose. But even without bacon, beans and fried eggs, there's plenty to choose from: white and dark bread, croissants, rolls and muffins. Various jams/marmelades, cheese with and without cuminseeds, ham and other cuts, yoghurt, cereals, and fruit. Different types of juice, cocoa and of course coffee, (with hot milk - yummy!), and teas. And the funniest thing: a pot of almost boiling water on a hotplate, and some curious boil-your-own-egg-dipping-basket-things (-and that's my short description!). Never seen that before!! Security is good. I've been to Amsterdam before, and I've always stored my valuables in a safe, or held them close to my person where I went, and still felt a bit unsafe. At this place, I really felt I didn't have to watch my things all the time - which was really nice!

The location of the Dikker & Thijs just a block from the Leidesplein was a big plus, and their rates were much more favorable--AND included breakfast which the other hotel did not, AND included a free ticket to either the Van Gogh or the Rijksmuseum (my choice). Decided to try it. Glad I did. I requested a non-smoking room, preferably on a high floor overlooking the canal. As usual, they couldn't guarantee it but would try. I said the high floor over a canal was negotiable but the non-smoking room was not, that I would look elsewhere if they wouldn't guarantee it. After two e-mail exchanges, the nice reservations mgr promised to \"block off\" a non-smoking room for me. And she did. I also got a great room--504--on the top floor except for the penthouse. Very big. (I'd only asked for a single.) It had a balcony with a great view over the rooftops and canals. My one Dutch friend came over and checked it out and was impressed. What's the catch, you're wondering? There's only one. It wasn't air conditioned. I understand some of the rooms are; this one wasn't. It was unseasonably balmy in A'dam (global warming), but nights were breezy and cool, and I kept the door to the balcony open, so it was fine. And there was also a tall, rotating fan in the room which I turned on but pointed away from the bed, as I don't like wind blowing on me. Breakfast was plentiful and good. It didn't vary, but as I was there for only 3 nights, that didn't matter. The staff was courteous. It's an old fashioned hotel in that they want the key turned into them whenever you leave the hotel, but I had no problem with that.

Fantastic location also for nightlife. The cafe bars and restaurants of LEIDSEPLEIN was 2 mins by foot from hotel. Spoilt for choice, with abudance of Italian / Chinese/ Indonesian/ Indian/ Greek / Mexican eateries. Macdonalds and Burger King also, if you must. Perfect spot to people-watch and chill out with local Amstel or Heineken beer. Again, the ONLY downside with this location was the street noise from partying passers-by heading home to bed at 4AM. Great location for the museum quarter, with RIJKSMUSEUM (handy for those of you who want to see Rembrandt in a hurry) and VAN GOGH MUSEUM 5 mins walking distance. Went for a stroll to litter-strewn VONDELPARK as well - which was dissappointing to say the least. Even the lakes was like a rubbish tip.
