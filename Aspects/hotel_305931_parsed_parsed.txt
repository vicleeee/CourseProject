<Content>Cramped Stay @ The South Pacific Whenever i visit a country, I like to look at other hotels in the area for my next stay. Have always wanted to stay here as it seems to be in a nice location and looks a nice hotel. The reception staff here were very depressing and not welcoming. Then he said he give me an upgrade to a superior room. I thought wow an upgrade!! How more disappointed could i have been.Knowing Hog Kong rooms can be on the small side, this was small and not enough room to throw the proverbial cat around. I wish somehow now i stayed at the Cosmo Hotel just up the road. I also wondered that if this was a superior room, what would the original standard room be like?Additionally, hotels in Hong Kong usually offer you free bottles of water and here you had to pay for it or make a small trek to the corridor to put your glass through a small opening to the water dispenser. Additionally, when guests were departing/entering their rooms, the automatic closing door made a noisy bang each time. None of this smooth shutting of doors that they supposed to do. The one positive point is that Housekeeping were available 24 hours and very helpful and made the room when you wanted it made. Also they were very prompt when requesting additional pillows and towels. Also i must congratulate the innovative Christmas decorations in the lobby, where the decorations were all made from recyclable items. Sadly this didn't make it to your room where you usually get the help the environment card. Would I go there again. NO. Was i disappointed from my original desire to stay there. YES

<Content>Ok Hotel Stayed at this hotel in Nov 2007 with my dad for a family holiday as he lived here in the 80's. The hotel was nice, the entrance was extravagant and seemed very nice. However, the room was very small, which was disappointing as the pictures seemed a lot larger. The room was clean, but very small.The maids did a good job, however, it was just too small for two people. The rest of the hotel was faultless, the restaurant was nice, good choices of food, and the staff were amazing, could not do enough to help you.Nice hotel, just watch out for the size of the rooms. Other wise lovely.

<Content>South Pacific Hotel - Excellent We stayed at the South Pacific Hotel yet again and the service was excellent . We have stayed at this hotel for the past 15 consecutive years now always on on the Executive Floor. The decor is very nice and all the little extras that come with that floor make your stay even more enjoyable. In 2007 we treated ourselves and stayed in an Executive studio room, where there was a main bedroom, large bathroom and spacious lounge. That extra room is great when you are there for 10 days. Loved that so much we stayed in the same room this year and will again next year. We loved the food in the La Pacifica Restaurant for dinner and was lucky enough this year to be treated to their new Stone Grill menu in the La Pacifica. Well worth trying!!!Complimentary drinks and canapes in the Executive Lounge was great to relax to after being out shopping all day. It was even great to have in-room broadband connection. The staff are more than helpful, especially the housekeepers that maintain the rooms. It's good to go back every year and be remembered by the housekeeper, bellboys, front desk staff and Restaurant staff. The Director of Sales and Marketing is a lovely lady and we thank her greatly for looking after us for so many years.

<Content>Satisfied I stayed here for 3 nights. Check in was brisk and the room was adequate - neat, not too large yet not too small (considering this is Hong Kong). Location was good, near the hustle and bustle of Times Square. For everything else, there is always the MTR!

<Content>The Best Kept Secret in Hong Kong We (my wife and adult son) have stayed in this property on two occassions for one week on each stay. Both stays were in the trade fair peak season and as expected, the rates weren't exactly cheap anywhere in Hong Kong.On our first stay, we took an Executive Studio which is basically two standard rooms with a sliding glass divider in between. Our son slept on the pull-out sofa bed which was comfortable enough for a 120 kg heavy weight. We were on the 22nd floor and had a refreshing view of Happy Valley thru the large picture windows. The decor and amenities of the Executive Studio is on a par with the more expensive Park Lane and Excelsior in Causeway and it's only five minutes longer in walking distance to MTR station and the centre of Causeway Bay.Internet wi-fi access (we didn't find an ethenet socket in the room) was complimentary in the Executive Studio but it's only good for one laptop. Apparently the server records your MAC address on first log-in and the same log-in could not be used for a second lap top and we had to purchase a 7-day pass for about A$50 - not that bad by Asian standards for the second laptop.It was nice to be able to enjoy a free quick light breakfast and coffee in the Executive Lounge with a sweeping view of the surrounding area in the morning and free snacks and coctails in the evening.On our second stay, we decided to take two standard room for the same price as one Executive Studio to give our adult son some privacy. We were given two ajoining rooms in the high teens and still had a pleasant outlook. However the decore (tired) and bathroom amenities (very basic) were so different to the Executive Studio that we thought we had booked into a different hotel! Each individual standard room at about 20 sq metres, is also a bit cramped. Nevertheless, the standard rooms were spotless and housekeeping standards were just as high as the Executive Studio. Internet was not free in the standard rooms but the charge was still reasonable at A$50 for 7 days. We missed the Executive Lounge privilages.This is a property under Chinese ownership and management and attracts more Asian guests than say the Excelsior or Park Lane. Nevertheless the Asian (mainly mainland Chinese) guests were polite and well mannered and did not make too much noise like the groups we have encountered in some cheaper hotels on the Kowloon side.The hotel's staff were without exception very helpful , friendly and efficient. Reception staff had a good command of English and the bell boys and housekeepers spoke and understood enough English to do their jobs. The doorman - an unusually small built Sikh gentleman was excellent.There are two small laundries on the side street (hang a right as you exit the main door) which offers same day bag wash for a very reasonable price. The same side street is also a short cut to Time Square and MTR station. While perfectly safe to take the short cut, be prepared for a very crowded experience with locals going to/from the local wet market and assorted food stores, especially on weekends.We only ate at the Executive Lounge (basic continental breakfast) and the LuLu restaurant in the basement. The LuLu has a reputation as a better Shanghai restaurant among locals. While not cheap, they give you back about 50% of the bill in gift vouchers which can be used for another visit.There is only one bar in the hotel which is the Sky Lounge on the top floor. While offering a sweeping vista of Hong Kong, it is very much a Chingrish hangout - loud live music and smokey. It also has a minimum charge of about 3 beers worth per person - no exceptions even for hotel guests.In summary, this is the cheapest clean and friendly hotel I could find in the Causeway Bay area (well, technically it's on the boundaries of Wan Chai) that offers full service (room service, bell boys, doorman etc). If five more minutes of walking to the MTR and shops doesn't bother you, I would certainly recommend it as good value for money. Off seasons rates are under A$100 for a standard room.BTW Causeway Bay is in my opinion an amazing area. There are shopping opportunities every few steps and the choice of restaurants is endless. If you are attending a trade fair at the Convention Centre, the South Pacific offer a free shuttle. If you have business downtown, the MTR (probably the best in the World) will get you there in 15 minutes.

<Content>Family friendly too! South Pacific hotel is smaller than what is shown in its website but the location is very nice. Just 10-minute (or less) walk to many stores, Time Square, KFC, 7-11, Pizza Hut and other popular eateries. There is also a currency exchange shop in a side street after the mall. Safe to walk around even at night. At first, I am hesitant to book here because we are a family of five (their max. is 4 per room). I book in the executive studio room so its larger, equivalent perhaps to 2 standard rooms. We had 2 single beds in the bedroom then they removed the sofa and laid down another bed. I really appreciated what they did just so we could all have comfortable sleep. My children enjoyed using the computerized bidet and watching the scene outside from the very large windows in the room. The gym is small but its free. We also have the privelege to have free internet access though they have only 2 computers. The staff is friendly too. Overall, we have a pleasant stay in this hotel.

<Content>Clean; good value; safe location - BUT small rooms I can't really complain about this hotel. The staff were great. For around 100 dollars you can't do wrong. Although the rooms are very small; they are very clean. The location is safe; its not far from the action; if you want a taxi it will take less than a minute to find:BUT for me, the highlight was the staff, SO helpful. In such an unfriendly city; it was nice to meet some people that actually smile:. The porters work tirelessly, and t the girls at reception know every single thing about the city, one even drew a map/guide for me for some places you won't find in the tourist books. Good experience overall.

<Content>Great Location in the Diamond District I selected this hotel be/c of its location near our daughters workplace, but found it to be in the middle of the diamond and chandelier district! Walking the streets night or day was highly entertaining! You have never seen so many shimmering diamonds (GIANT ONES) in the shop windows in your life; and chandeliers taller than i am! The hotel is nice, rooms are small, beds hard (duh, all beds in CHina are hard) but the bath was solid white marble and had GREAT water pressure in the shower for a real needed massage feeling! i stayed twice in the same week, 2 nites each, i booked one thru a Hong Kong service, Agoda, but the other direct. Got the nicer room by going direct. Wonderful doorman, in his Turban and red jacket, white mustache, almost like a movie scene! the bell man and desk helpful with directions, cab, etc.... The double rooms have the equivilent of a queen bed but they dont call it that, the singles have 2 twins. Great bakery just a block down and around the corner, went there every morning.

<Content>Nice hotel but away from main attractions The South Pacific is a nice modern hotel but the location is away from the main Hong Kong attractions (20 mins walk). Our room was small but I think this is typical in crowded Hong Kong. The only slight issue was the noise from the passing elevators which could be heard in the room.

<Content>Not bad at all - for the price Stayed here with a group of male friends in November. Randy, the concierge, looked after us admirably and the other staff were also very helpful. I was that happy with the staff that I was willing to leave my laptop with them, on check out day, and had no worries that it would be 100% safe.Yes the rooms are a little small but it's very cheap for a city centre hotel. Times Square is two minutes walk away and Happy Valley is also very close. It's also about a 45 minute taxi ride from the airport.Food was so-so buit, again, what can you really expect from a 3 star hotel which is as cheap as this?I'd put it on a par with a UK travel lodge, although in some areas it far exceeds this standard.Would I stay again - yes. Although next time I'm in Hong Kong I'll probably stay in Kowloon to sample more of that side of Hong Kong.

<Content>Times Square Hotel. Stayed here with my fiancee for Eight nights. Times Square is about 3 minutes walk with fantastic shopping and the MTR to access all of Hong Kong. Bars, restaurants and lovely little side street outside hotel with fresh seafood chinese local eateries and a daily market that bristles with colour and local tradition. Rooms: Upgrade to Deluxe overlooking Happy Valley racecourse. Cosy room, clean, very warm feel. Bathroom clean, ok size, modern. Well soundproofed. Mattress felt like a slab of marble my only critizism! Room maids are fantastic.Amenities: Great little Gymn. Starlight Piano lounge top floor with singers and a bar although I didn`t use it. Two internet terminals a bit pricey but cheap internet just across the road. Great breakfast room, really classy and a restaurant downstairs. Overall it is a modern hotel, very clean, helpful staff and fantastic position on Hong Kong Island at a reasonable rate.

<Content>Reasonable... but very 3 star The south pacific is a clean and tidy hotel with nice reception area and good restaurants.I found the desk staff to be uncaring, bordering on rude but the doorman and porters were very nice.The rooms were very ordinary and small with very hard beds.The gymnasium is a complete joke.The hotel is located close to Happy valley racecourse, which is in a very interesting part of Hong Kong.

<Content>Very Convenient I lived here quite a few times.. i know the managers because of my frequent stay so i always get good benefits. To tell you the truth the roooms are very bad so everytime i live here I only live in the Presidential Suite.... it is a big big big big difference with other rooms, Other then living in the Presidential Suite then there is no point living here.. but i must say the price is a great deal for other rooms, but rooms are poor. As you can see my other reviews, I said i am willing to help anyone so you can email me and i will tell you the truth about hotels.. The real face of them...

<Content>Best Deal in Hong Kong For the US$89 I paid, I can't imagine a better deal in Hong Kong. The room was on the small side, but it was still fine for a couple. The decor was tasteful and everything was very clean. Very convenient location as well. On the strange side, the staff uniforms looked liked an 80' wedding band.

<Content>Clean  I stayed 3 nights here at the end of April while visiting extended family in Hong Kong. My uncle, a local travel agent, recommended this hotel as a reasonably priced hotel that was conveniently located.  We were satisfied with our choice, though not terribly impressed. The room was small, really barely fitting two twin beds, a desk, and a night table, leaving very little room to walk around, or to store our large suitcase. The cleaning staff was friendly, and attentive. (we had to call them right away to move the twin beds together to make the 'king size' bed we'd been promised on check-in - they came within 5 mins) The bathroom was clean, but did not have a hairdryer (you have to call the front desk for one). Our view was of the back of the next building - not very pretty.  Location is close to central, about a 10-12 minute walk to the MTR, and a 5 min walk to the trolleys. Times Square is a huge shopping center, with a large food court, which is only 5-10 minutes away (current street construction makes the way difficult to find though).  The most convenient part of the hotel is the airport shuttle you can book from the lobby. It's about $20 one way and drops you off directly at your terminal.  Overall, hotels in Hong Kong tend to be very expensive, and this hotel was reasonably priced, clean, and in a safe, convenient area, and that is all we needed. It was on par to a nicer Holiday Inn in the U.S.

<Content>Great location great location being very close to Times Square which has plenty of shops and eating options. Causeway Bay MTR is under Times Square and is therefore only a 5 minute walk away. The room was clean and functional if a little small but I only paid 拢171 for 4 nights so I can hardly complain. I used the gym which was very small but at least the equipment was in good condition. I also utilised the business centre on the top floor to use the internet facility to print out my flight's boarding card the charge was a resaonable HK$30 for upto 45 minutes including printing. If the price was right I would stay here again.

<Content>Good:above average Good: above averageLocation: excellentIt is near Timesquare and MRT Causeway Bay Station. It is in 5-minute walking. (Please don't confuse. Its address is on Wanchai but it is close Causeway Bay.) Moreover, in Timesquare, there are many up-scale and local restaurants, including food court for cheaper food. Cleanness: GoodMy room is old but still looks OK. Every thing is very clean. The room was daily cleaned. However, my mom was allergy to the shower plus shampoo, provided by the hotel and was itchy. (I am OK with it.)The Room: OKThe renovation of the lobby is complete. I got the old room but still look OK. The room size is quite small but comfortable. I also requested non-smoking room. I got it on 17 floor. Unfortunately, I could still hear some noise from the traffic like the downtown of the other city. It didn鈥檛 bother me and my mom. Service: OKIt is also OK for me. Note: the taxi fee from the hotel to Airport Express Station is about 30$ plus luggage fee (5 each). You can use the in-town check-in at that station in advance. Then go to the other places before your plane leaving. (Please check before because some air lines don鈥檛 have this service.)In conclusion, I like it. It is above average

<Content>Reasonable stay We arrived at the South Pacific not knowing fully what to expect. We had booked on a budget and it was our first time to Hong Kong.The staff were reasonable, not overfriendly but not discourteous. The rooms were small but I liked them because of this, it gave a cosy contrast to Hong Kong鈥檚 cold damp spring weather.The positioning of the hotel could have been better, we used the underground system for the duration of our stay and it was a good ten-minute walk to the nearest station. It鈥檚 also handy that the structure is so noticeable, especially when we attempted to find our way home at night after a couple of drinks...Moral of the review, if your young and adventurous and the hotel you stay in isn鈥檛 going to make nor break your trip then this is a good mid range choice.

<Content>Don't expect too much The South Pacific Hotel is on Hongkong Island, some blocks away from the main road. The building has 28 floors and 276 rooms and it seems to be in a rather good condition in contrast to its surrounding. You can find lots of stop-over-tourists as well as businessmen there.As I wrote, the hotel is in an side street - in fact not a big problem but this is an area of workers and not very clean and relaxed. The connection to public transport is okay with historic tram, plenty of busses and famous Star Ferry just some minutes walk away. There are also dozens of taxis. An airport transfer bus works regularly but is very hard to find in the city. Coming from the airport you are lucky to get off the bus at the right place. If they don't like to stop, they simply don't stop! And there are almost no signs showing the street name. Public transport is not easy to use in Hongkong and please inform about payment methods before entering a tram, bus etc.The portier of South Pacific gives you a warm welcome at the door, the check-in is quick but not very friendly. A boy brings your luggage to the room. Some of the clerks only speak very bad english. They don't want to give you some information about airport transfer.The room was almost a joke. We only paid 56 Euro but it was not very clean and the size was ridiculous. If you wear large shoes please enter the room backwards because a turn over inside is almost impossible. The bathroom showes signs of mould and dirt. The carpets and furniture are ready to be replaced and this is how the room smells. There was a very small TV with just one english speaking channel (Discovery) working. All lights have to be switched from a board next to the bed. It remembered me the polytechnical lessons in primary school. The most bad thing was the look out of the tiny little windows. The backyard looked like a scenery somewhere in a ghetto and was quite depressing. It was our first time in Asia and I don't know much about the standards of accomodation there but South Pacific Hotel was not the best choice.

<Content>nice rooms was in hong kong january of last year. and for someone coming from a warm country like the philippines, it was really cold when we were there. Our room in the South Pacific was a warm haven after a long day of walking in the cold. Also, I had to share the room with a friend and her young son so we were a little cramped but overall, the room was great! I couldn't say the same about the breakfast though =)

<Content>Happy with the choice of hotel We stayed here for 6 nights beginning of November 2006. We used the airport shuttle bus to arrive and the hotel was just a few minutes walk from Hennessey Road.It is a nice, modern looking building. We had no problems there with the service. The only complaint I would have is that the rooms are quite small, being rounded in shape as it is a cylindrical shaped hotel. However, this did not pose any problems at all.It is about 10 minutes walk from the Causeway Bay metro stop and about the same from the the Wan Chai metro stop.However, we often took the tram which is only 2-3 mins walk from the hotel.It is located very close to a number of restaurants and 7/11 stores for daily supplies and Times Square shopping centre is only a 10 minute walk too.

<Content>Will go back! Nice experience overall and for the price. The room and bathroom were clean, no mold or grime. They are smaller than the average rooms but easy to get around in. The sheets were crisp and clean and the carpet looked clean and in good shape. White terry slippers, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and combs were provided almost daily. Towels were thicker than average. We were on a high floor so did not hear any street noise. It is close to main streets and a 2-min walk to the Times Square subway and shopping mall. Very convenient. At the back of the hotel is an open market with fresh vegetables, flowers, meats and seafood. Wonderful sight, safe, and clean with all the constant hosing and cleaning. Concierge were helpful with all our questions. Lobby is busy-looking with all the marble but clean. Will go back.

<Content>Good Location, Enjoyable Stay. Rooms were clean, bright and cosy. Perfect for a couple who want a nice end of day home from home. Higher floors are more peaceful as less traffic noise. Hotel reception was always helpful in answering questions and booking tours. Location is next to Times Square (3 minute walk) and all shops and restaurants and MTR rail link. Hotel cuisine is excellent (a little bit expensive) and they have two internet pay terminals. Great Location, informative staff, a good honest hotel at a reasonable room rate.

<Content>Clean, good value, great breakfast, decent location We ended up here because we waited too long to book and the whole city was booked up for an electronics conference. But, we got a good rate online through a last-minute website. Our room was very clean and didn't smell -- tough to find affordably in HK, I believe. Good location (5-7 mins walk from subway). Very helpful staff. They have a complimentary shuttle service to/from the airport express train. Yummy breakfast.

<Author>Leyland-wanderer
<Content>Great Position My wife and I stayed at the South Pacific in November 2006 for four nights. The hotel is situated on Hong Kong Island in an area where the Chinese workers live. Although not particularly a tourist area we found it facinating visiting street markets and such. The hotel was being renovated when we stayed there and to be fair it needed updating. The rooms were clean and about average for a three star hotel. We ate once in the hotel and found it to be a little more expensive than comparable nearby restaurants but the quality was good. The top floor of the hotel is the starlight lounge and overlooks Happy Valley Racecourse. We found it an ideal place for a night cap and to look out over the island.Getting to the hotel - use the airport express train - its excellent - and there are a numerous taxis available on your arrival at Hong Kong rail station. Hong Kong is the last stop of four on the track and, on your return, you can check your baggage at the railway station for your next flight - a brilliant idea!Our favourite day out was to the Po Lin Buddha on Lan Tau Island. The organised trips would have cost about 拢120 each but the MTR (about 拢10 for as many trips in a day as you want to take) stops at the skyrail (拢20 for 2) that takes you to the buddha.Would I stay there again - probably not because it is a little far out from the attractions on a short stay - but thats the only reason why I wouldn't. I definitely would choose to stay on Hong Kong Island though, rather than Kowloon.

<Content>Jan 2007 - Beware of the Renovations! Be aware that renovations began in the lobby on 3 Jan 2007 - unfortunately when I happened to be there. The noise did carry through at least 13 floors and it was quite messy checking in/out in the ballroom.The hotel ignored my specific booking for a twin, providing a double, but quickly switching us to a twin without any fuss. The tiny bathroom is quite inconvenient compared to other similar hotels in HK, with the shower located inside the bathtub which you need to clamber inside. Otherwise, no major complaints.

<Content>Aweful, decrepit, puny, smelly, damp, mouldy. Hideous!!! Yuk!!! This is the WORST hotel we have ever stayed at. It is absolutely HORRIBLE. Don't ever go there. If Trip Advisor allowed us to give out our cell phone numbers, we would offer everyone to call us collect on them so we could talk them out of staying there.Where to start? The front desk staff are SNARLY and obviously hate working there. The hallways are SMELLY, dimly-lit dungeons with ceilings so low, I barely cleared them. The rooms smell DAMP and MOULDY. The rooms are so SMALL, you have to get into and out of the bed from the foot of the bed because both sides of the bed clear the walls by only a few inches. The bathrooms are so small, you have to do a little contortionist dance to get the door closed before sitting on the toilet. And the beds? Do you know how when you buy a new mattress set and they will take away your old ones for you? Guess where they go? My wife and I travel often and have been to Hong Kong many times. We always use TripAdvisor to find hotels and always write reviews when we return. We have written dozens of great reviews. This is the first bad review we have ever written. We cannot understand why the majority of reviews are neutral or positive. It is WRONG, WRONG, WRONG. Don't listen to them. Don't go there.

<Content>Repeat guests. We are repeat visitors to Hong Kong and we often stay at the South Pacific Hotel (since 2000). In that time we have been able to book rooms from online websites for $60-75 USD. This makes it an excellent value hotel. Yes, the rooms are rather small, though the size depends on where you are in the curve of the building. We have experienced rooms that were in great condition and some that were a bit worn, but they have since been renovating the building. Ask for a recently renovated, non-smoking room. The non-smoking floors are also much quieter.What we love about the South Pacific: The CLEAN duvet covered down comforters; the friendly Sikh doorman in full regalia; the cheap laundry next door; the nearby outdoor market with wackie seafood; quick walk to Time's Square with its excellent food court and cheap sushi; nearby Pizza Hut and Starbucks (Time's Square) for when we need a quick western food fix; in-room safe and electric kettle. We haven't eaten at the SP restaurants, except for the breakfast buffet, a convenient and hearty meal for an okay hotel restaurant price (we remember it as $10-15 USD). Location is what makes the hotel worth its price, as from the SP you can easily get to any point in HK. Easy walk to the nearest MTR (10 min), tram/bus stop (2 min), taxi rank (right outside the door - ask the Sikh doorman!), Wan Chai Star Ferry terminal (10 min), Time's Square shopping, entertainment and food (5 min).FYI - Take the Airport Express train to Central. From there catch a taxi to the SP for $25-50 HKD depending on traffic. If your taxi driver doesn't understand where you want to go, point to the free, bilingual map that you wisely picked up at the airport! (We just hand them the hotel's card, but you probably won't have that if you're reading this!)Check out the egg tarts ($2 HKD) at the bakery near the 7-11. 7-11 is good for the South China Morning Post in the morning and a cheap can/bottle of beer in the evening. Also, check out the little evening waffle/fish ball/fried tofu stand on the corner near 7-11. The tall bald man serves a mean sweet waffle with peanut butter! The SP mini-bar strategy is to price things high enough that you won't want to buy anything. This makes it easier for everyone, we guess, especially since they don't mind if you stash your own drinks from 7-11 in the fridge! We hope you'll love the SP like we do!

<Content>Great hotel! Totally ignore the previous review! I don't know what the previous reviewer is on about! Were we staying in the same hotel?!!? Me and my husband stayed here for 9 nights. We arrived before check in time and were quickly accomodated into an available room. Initally we were given a room with twin beds so we asked for a double bed and it was no problem to change room. The room was very clean, reasonably spacious with a safe, power shower and free slippers! The wall paper was not coming off the walls and the room did not smell badly. The hotel is not old fashioned, but rather is a very modern building (outside and inside). The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is in an excellent location - about 5/10 minutes walk to Causeway Bay metro and about 3 minute walk from the nearest tram adn various bus stops. The hotel is also just round the corner from Times Sq and a great outdoor market. My sister and her husband were also staying at this hotel at the same time as us (but for 5 nights). They loved the hotel as well. DEFINATELY RECOMMENDED.

<Content>TERRIBLE... Dont be fooled by website.. Ok.. WHAT are these people on here talking about?..Im here right now writing this review.. (THANK GOD FOR THIS WEBSITE).. Do not be fooled by the website the hotel offers.. with the fancy layout lets say they spent lots of money on the site instead of their hotel.IT is so bad here.. THe hotel floors smell like mold and mildew.. the wall paper is coming off the walls in the creepy 60'sish hallways.. it is like staying in a out of date brothel in Amsterdam or the Bronx in NYC. There are stains and holes in the walls. The rooms are so out dated.. paint comming off the metal chairs.. i have never stayed at a worse hotel.. motel 6 has better rooms. Im not exaggerating.. you must take this into considerationI asked for change of rooms and they brought me a lil machine to make the room change the smell.. Well MOLD doesnt go away like that.. they keep telling me the hotel is fully booked..DO whatever you can to stay anywhere else..but here..

<Content>Good location, friendly service. First stop of a round the world trip! Stayed 3nts Room Only at this hotel. Excellent location on the Hong Kong Island side, Under 5mins walk to Times Square (where the metro is), along with fantastic view of the Racecourse and the rest of the surrounding hills!Clean and comfortable rooms, nothing super-special but fine for the price paid. Air Conditioning came in VERY handy!!! An excellent choice for a mid-range hotel in HK.

<Content>Fabulous hotel - No complaints here!!!!!! My partner and I arrived at the South Pacific at 1 a.m. and was quickly checked in to our room in less than 5 mins. Staff were really friendly and very helpful when wishing to order taxi's, restaurant reservations etcThe location of the hotel is amazing, it is within five minute's walk from Time's Square and also only 10 minutes drive away from Ocean Park which is def worth a visit!!!!!There is an MTR station in Times Square which will get you to anywhere in Hong Kong in less than half hour. The fare for the MTR was only 5 hong kong dollars which works out to about 35p.I can honestly say the MTR system is ten times better than the London Underground and at a fraction of the price.During the time we stayed there were road works which we could hear from our 6th floor room. We informed the hotel staff of this problem and we were promptly moved to the 10th floor.The room was very clean and although not huge - not as small as previous reviews say. They do have 3 pin electric mains which match ours here at home. However the bathroom was quite small but adequate. Overall i cannot fault this hotel and would def stay there again.This was my first time in Hong Kong and loved it so much we plan to go back in the near future.

<Content>review of South Pacific Hotel I stayed at the South Pacific Hotel on June 21 for six days. The hotel is small and going through renovations. The room is standard. While it was clean the carpet seems dirty and the walls need to be updated.Also, they only give you one role of toilet paper so if you need more not sure what you have to do.While it was okay since we are hardly in the hotel, I would wait until the entire renovations are done.The Novatel Hotel is about three blocks down the street and seemed more nicer and about in the same price range. Would stay there until this Hotel is fixed up.

<Content>small but nice hotel The room is new and clean. It is located at a busy district, in between Wan Chai and Causeway Bay. It is near the Time Square which is within walking distance. The staff is nice and friendly. Although it is not located next to MTR, you are easy to go to Causeway Bay by using other transportation. The room rate is reasonable and is economy when compare with other hotels located at Causeway Bay.

<Content>Small room, friendly service but noisy kareoke on top floor I stayed on the non-smoking executive floor, which had a relaxing biz center where breakfast and cocktails are served daily. There were also 2 computers w/ free internet access. The room was semi-circle, very small but cozy. They use yellow ginham duvet w/ down comforter rather than your old boring blanket + sheets. Everything was fine until I tried to go to sleep. There's a lounge on the floor above and the kareoke singing just cannot be muffled! Decided to check out after 2-night stay eventhough originally planned to stay for 4. Staff had wanted to change a room for me but by the time I called them back at night, they had already gave the room away.

<Content>11 days in HK We stayed at the South Pacific Hotel from 07/03/2006-16/03/2006 and found our stay to be most enjoyable. The hotel is quite basic,with a bar fridge and kettle,very clean and well located in Wanchai,with shops (two good bakeries nearby) and Times Square an easy walk, transport is very close. The concierge, the doorman and the cleaning staff were very friendly and attentive.The twin bed room was more spacious than the double room, the beds are easy enough to push together.We would have no hesitation in returning to this budget hotel.
