<Content>Why I love this site The fact that the Soho ranks as London's best is one of the many reasons why I love Tripadvisor. I've stayed at the lion's share of upmarket London properties on business; time and again when I am asked what my favorite hotel in London would be, I immediately exclaim: The Soho! There's nothing that comes close to approximating the combination of nice design, warm service and buzzy atmosphere. I have even tried other Firmdale Hotels addresses thinking I might come close. The Covent Garden and Haymarket almost do the trick, but in the end, it's not just about the hotel - the cul-de-sac location is equally fab, almost like a cocoon, but at the heart of the West End, deep inside Soho, my favorite place to stay in Central London for about a million reasons. The restaurant isn't particularly noteworthy - not worth the price if you're an American in London with limited $$ to spend - but drinks and apps at the bar would be a fine idea at least one evening. Also make sure to take advantage of the guest lounges, both of them marvelous.

<Content>Just wonderful!! Expensive but worth it, truly. My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful long weekend in the Soho Hotel (Dec. 2008). The hotel is the most perfect example of how a boutique hotel should be - small, exclusive, pampering, personal care and lots more - specifically the hotel is beautifully designed, excellent central yet quiet location - everything one could want for a quiet, romantic weekend. Well worth the splurge!

<Content>Best customer service I've ever had This is not a cheap hotel, but if you have the dosh to give yourself a little treat, you will certainly feel treated. From beginning to end the staff were attentive, but not obtrusive, and the room was glorious. If I have a criticism it would be that the restaurant/bar in the hotel is overpriced for what it is, but you're right in the heart of Soho so there's no need to restrict yourself to eating there if you don't want. London's at your feet.

<Content>BETTER than the reviews! My husband and I stayed here on a two night shopping trip to London. We have travelled broadly and enjoy the indulgence of five star hotels whenever we can.The Soho Hotel was even better than the reviews; beautiful, funky, great/friendly staff, superb food, air-conditioning that worked properly, a spacious room etc etc.Special things to note included the breakfast. Never have we had such a wonderful continental breakfast. On the dozens of buffet breakfasts that we've had round the world, we've normally found that the fruit isn't necessarily ripe or not replenished but at the Soho there was perfectly ripe mango and strawberries amongst everything else. Home made granola, amazing pastries....Yes, it is expensive and a treat. Pity that breakfast and internet are not included in the price but it was still absolutely worth it. Will be back as soon as we can (hmm, wonder if we can move in...?!)

<Content>simply the best This was our 2nd visit to The Soho Hotel and the experience was, just as good as the first. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels but this is by far my favorite.On checking in, before we were taken to our room, we were given a quick tour of the hotel to get our bearings. A nice touch i felt.The rooms are fantastic with a nice modern feel and the bathroom was even better.Throughout our stay the staff were always extremely helpful and polite.We will defiantly be going back and i can't say any better things about it than that.

<Content>A Fantastic Stay I stayed for one night with friends as part of a civil partnership celebration. It was an amazing location with hospitality that was second to none. The room (a deluxe double) was huge by London standards with excellent facilities. The bar is buzzing and the cocktails are pricey but excellent.What sets the hotel apart though are the excellent staff. They are polite and cannot do enough for you, but also very friendly and laidback. This gives the hotel a very different more intimate atmosphere to others I've experienced and I would not hesitate to recommend it to others.

<Content>fabulous hotel Myself, sister and mother had a wonderful 4 day stay at the Soho to celebrate our mum's 60th Birthday. The staff were so friendly and the attention given to us was first class.We stayed in a junior suite and absolutely loved it the room was huge and had lots of lovely touches, lights in the fitted wardrobes,well stocked mini bar, flat screen TV that swiveled round to face the bed, great bathroom products (miller harris) we also liked the turn down service in the evening with complimentary bottled water, pillow spray to help you doze off and even complimentary aromatherapy oils !We ate in the Refuel restaurant twice, as the food was superb and would like to give a special mention to Kassia who really looked after us, she was a gem. we felt our stay at the Soho really made our weekend and would return in a minute, Loved it!

<Content>Amazing Really fantastic hotel - costs a lot to stay there but well worth it. We went for our 5th wedding anniversary and the staff made it so special for us. We had a half bottle of champagne waiting for us in our room with some nibbles.The cocktail bar is fab - great spot to celeb watch!!Food great and the room service isn't too pricey.Overall, better than Kempinsky and similar hotels we've stayed in.

<Content>Splendid hotel! I really love this hotel. The rooms are always clean and very comfortable. The housekeeping staff makes everything gleam and our suite was spotless for us every day. I have stayed at several hotels in the London area and have now returned here twice. I feel this one is my favorite for style and cleanliness. Also it is in a great location for shopping and going out to eat. The concierges have always been helpful and pleasant. I love that it is tucked away, yet close to everything. We will certainly be back again.

<Content>loved the upgrade We stayed here for our honeymoon on 7-9 Sept 2008. My husband had visited the hotel previously to ensure its perfection and received excellent hospitality from the staff. When we arrived, Mel on front desk had upgraded us to an apartment - what a surprise and so very generous. The apartment was amazing and so spacious. We love Soho and really, we wouldn't have left the hotel if we hadn't so much to see and do. The bar is a great place to hang out and it is very tastefully decorated. I can't thank Mel enough for looking after us so well. I truly had a wonderful honeymoon - once in a lifetime stay. Thank you.

<Content>so-chic in soho Quietly exuding charm and luxury this hotel doesn't scream look at me from its small back street entrance, but as you catch sight of the huge statue of a cat as you walk down the steps to reception something tells you this is no wallflower of a hotel.From the the reception team, to the spacious boutique feeling rooms; the honesty bar in the communal living room to the quality foods at breakfast; everything this hotel does it oozes style and panache and if you fail to be impressed I implore anyone to not raise an 'all appreciating' eyebrow at the beautifully boxed complimentary chocolates left in your room or even the clever way in which the bathroom mirror never steams up. This is a hotel that has thought about the little touches that make staying away from home an absolute delight. I challenge anyone to stay here and still pine for home - i've been looking for an excuse to go back ever since i checked out!

<Content>Super Hotel My Husband and I have just returned from a 3 night stay in the Soho Hotel. From the minute we entered the Hotel the Staff were more than courtious and informative. As per previous reviews it is a very modern hotel, with lovely amenities. We stayed in a delux Junior Suite which was superb. Great big comfortable bed with lovely egyptian cotten bed linen. Great selection of TV chanels for viewing. The food was excellent and the waiting staff were so friendly and pleasant, always smiling. Overall the staff were noticably pleasant throughout our stay. I did have a massage and the only down side if I wanted to be picky was that I could hear the tread mill operating outside the door during my treatment, which left it a little hard to totally relax. Once outside the hotel there was a magificant buzz in the Soho area every night. The hotel is close to a lot of the Theatres most of which are in walking distance. Would definitately recommend the Soho ot anyone considering staying there. However, it is not cheap, but you do get what you pay for.

<Content>Loved the Soho We booked six nights with the Soho Hotel and cannot complain about any part of our stay.The staff are friendly and willing to help not matter what the request was.We stayed in a junior suite which was spacious and beautifully decorated. Room was cleaned daily and all amenities replaced on a daily basis.Breakfast (which was included in our package) was great - more than we could eat. Very good location - close to underground and a large variety of pubs/restaurants.

<Content>Very expensive but very goof I stayed for a couple of nights on business and overall the experience was good. I had initially booked to stay for one night only but had to stay a second night. When I asked to extend the booking I was told the hotel was full but a room became available later on in the day, however I was told I had to change rooms. The second room I had was about half the size of the first. I went to reception and told them that I assumed that I was not being charged the same for the second night as for the first. They said I had been upgraded on the first night which I was not told on check in so am not sure that that was really the case. The bar was constantly busy and it was a great place for a little star spotting!Breakfast was excellent, again expensive.The resident's lounge is really lovely, beautifully furnished and decorated.There is a charge to use the WiFi which at the rates being charged by the hotel is pretty outrageous considering it doesn't cost them anything to provide it once it is in the building.

<Content>lots of positives and a few niggles I have just spent 3 nights at the Soho hotel with my 2 teenage sons. If I could I would rate the experience as 41/2 stars. Mostly it was lovely but there were a few flaws. Firstly the positives- We stayed in a deluxe suite which was large, very tasteful, pristine and with a super bathroom. The lighting was a bit subdued for my taste.The staff were all very pleasant, helpful and unpretentious. The service was excellent without being cloying. The hotel managed to be very luxurious and stylish without being overly formal. My issues were mainly to do with expense which I suppose is irrelevant to the super wealthy but an issue for people like myself who can afford the Soho as a once a year treat rather than a regular stay. When we arrived we were asked whether we would like a cup of tea sent to the room. Naively I thought this was complementary but in fact a pot of tea for 2 was 拢7.50! We were also offered tea in the morning but by this stage I knew to refuse. Breakfast was also confusing. The only way to have a cooked breakfast and to help ourselves to the buffet ( very important to my sons) was to order the 拢24-50 refuel breakfast which included fruit juice etc. However we were offered smoothies and I was amazed to be charged an extra 拢13.50 for these meaning are day 1 breakfast bill was 拢87-50! I must add that the food was lovely but still too expensive by most standards. Another niggle was internet access which my younger son was keen to have. This was 拢20 for 24 hours or 30 pence per minute - it should have been free in my opinion. So there we are - 41/2 stars.

<Content>Pleasing patchwork of English Modern style Friendly and informal; and unpretentious, despite a fashionable crowd at the bar. Very quiet and large room. Decor is English Modern; spotlessly clean. Egyptian cotton beds invite an early night and late rise. A cheerful restaurant; good wine list and knowledgeable sommelier. Dinner's Dover Sole was large; it was a bit heavy going at the end, but the breakfast is varied and full of good fresh things. The staff were great; Australians, South Africans, Eastern Europeans and even a Pom somewhere.

<Content>Excellent service Stayed for just over a week in August and was very satisfied.From check-in to check-out staff was highly attentive, briskly efficient and relaxingly courteous. (No annoying servility or pretension)Concierges were outstanding in setting up trips and transport, as well as recommending and booking restaurants.The huge Junior Suite (superb washroom) and all public rooms were spotlessly clean.Location is ideal for walking to Covent Garden, the British Museum, Piccadilly and Bond Street shopping or to the Royal Parks and Buckingham Palace.Difficult to find a negative here but the immediate area, considered vibrant and trendy by most, could be seen as somewhat louche by others.Overall it's hard to imagine a better place to stay in London.

<Content>Contemporary and Glam My husband booked us a night here (and dinner at Petrus - yes I am a lucky girl) for my birthday this year and it was wonderful. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite which was very spacious, immaculate and very well decked out in cool, contemporary fashion. The bed was huge, though the sofa was really uncomfortable. Bathroom was spotless, with lovely Miller Harris toiletries. Dressing area also very spacious with very large double wardrobes. We had a Junior Suite at the Ritz last year and this competed well in terms of space and amenities. Reception very efficient and welcoming and shared guest areas in the hotel were also cool. We had a few cocktails in the bar before heading out for dinner and the bar had a buzzy, busy atmosphere with a quirky cocktail list. I would definitely reccommend staying here and will hopefully be visiting again soon.

<Content>Fabulous Our arrival at The Soho Hotel was a very rushed affair as we were late for our tea reservation due to hideous london traffic - but the hotel was great! They took our car and the bags we threw at them and sorted us out with immediate taxi so we could get on our way with minimal delay. When we finally checked in and went to our gorgeous room we found that only 1 lot of bags had made its way to our room (our car had 2 boot spaces) so we phoned down to concierge - within minutes the bags arrived at the door! Fabulous, late check out was no problem and probably the best shower i have ever had at a hotel! The hotel's restaurant was fab with great food and service. I would stay here again and again and again.......Truly lovely experience

<Content>A well deserved first place Return visit to the Soho Hotel, absolutely fantastic, booked a Luxury Junior Suite and was delighted to be upgraded to a Deluxe Junior Suite, good start. The junior suite is very spacious with a superb king size bed, sofa table chairs working area, well presented bathrooms one common theme the rooms are immaculately clean!We arrived early morning and dropped off our luggage before indulging in a little retail therapy with the promise that the front desk would contact us as and when the room was ready which they duly did. Returning early afternoon we were immediately taken up to our room, luggage already in place, other hotels please take note very annoying to check into room and then wait for the luggage to follow on!As we were visiting Xcel in Docklands for a concert we asked for some travel options and within 10 mins concierge had secured car and driver for a return journey. We enjoyed a couple of drinks in the bar before our car arrived and took us to our destination, at the end of the concert driver was there waiting to take us back.Sunday morning was something of a lazy morning with a late breakfast in the room.Other reviews compliment the staff and we have to agree very professional, very friendly without being overly friendly, small details like remembering our names, our plans and offering assistance when ever required. Having stayed in many of the great london hotels this has been the first time in many years I can honestly say I could not find fault anywhere not in the accommodations, food, service etc.A perfect 10

<Content>Celeb haunt I, too, am a fan of the Soho Hotel. I have stayed there for a few times now (I think 4) and I very much look forward to our next visit in September. If you find yourself in the Soho Hotel watch out for the high celeb turnout: during Fashion week in February I spotted John Galliano and his entourage having a leisurely breakfast at the Refuel restaurant, while in the lift I bumped into no other than Colin Farrell who was meeting director Mike Leigh at the lobby. Though I fully respect people's privacy and would never ask for photos/autographs, it did make my stay in London even more special!

<Content>Fantastic! I just returned from The Soho, and what a fantastic stay I had. The staff were very nice from beginning to end. Great atmosphere in the bar at night, and great cocktails too. My room, a luxury room was really spacious, it overlooked the front of the hotel so you might feel a bit overlooked, but you just need to close the curtains. I can't comment on the restaurant as I didn't have my meals there, but breakfast was really good, I had room service which was delivered on time and with a smile.The hand-written welcome note from the manager was a very nice touch too.I will definitely be going back to The Soho Hotel.

<Content>A very enjoyable stay If you want to stay in a beautifully maintained hotel with excellent service and convenient central london location, then this hotel is certainly worth considering (subject of course to your budget). We booked in for a Sunday night stay. Soho itself is a very lively and buzzing place but the hotel is nicely tucked in a small side street and so was very quiet.For us, it was an expensive treat but worth it. The service was excellent, the staff are very attentive and friendly. We were taken up to our room and everything was well explained.The room was spacious and it was great to sleep on a 6ft size bed, although being short I had to climb onto it! The bathroom was very clean and well maintained with lovely products. After we had checked in, we had to leave our room in a rush to attend a wedding. I had therefore left the room in a mess, clothes on floor, wet towels and bathrobes everywhere, make up all the over the place. When I returned to the room, there was soft calming music playing in the background, the bathroom was returned to perfect condition, replaced with fresh clean towels, all my make up and skin care products were neatly tidied away, my clothes had been picked up and neatly placed. If only someone did this for me at home....There was also nice touches left in the room such as bottled water, bath massage oils, a soothing spay left on the pillow for a relaxing sleep .....ah bliss. If I have another opportunity to stay in London again, then this hotel would be first on the list.

<Content>Gorgeous hotel. Patchy service My boyfriend booked the Soho as a romantic treat for us. The idea was that we'd check in, order feasts from room service, get into bed and not surface again for 24 hours. We wanted romance, privacy and sleeeeep. This didn't happen. First, however, the good stuff: this hotel is one of the most stunning I've ever seen. The room was enormous - I mean really, really enormous - with gorgeous furnishings (although I was surprised they didn't have blackout curtains - they were almost see-through), with a great big bathroom and lovely toiletries from Miller Harris. Also lovely little details like the aromatherapy rollers etc. The bar downstairs was buzzing with groovy international types, the interior design of all the rooms downstairs is stunning, and the reception was charming. The bad stuff:1. Room service food was seriously unexceptional. The menu is very impressive, but the food wasn't up to scratch - especially breakfast. A small bowl of congealed, cold porridge, a scattering of fruit salad and three pieces of cold dry toast is not what you expect for 拢18. General attention to detail was ordinary, ie, a very small pot of milk to share between the porridge, a bowl or muesli and two large cafetieres of coffee.2. We got two automated wakeup calls that we hadn't asked for. At 8am. And then at ten past 8am. So much for sleeping in all morning.3. Room service knocked on the door loudly and shouted something unintelligble at us every twenty minutes from 10am. Couldn't they just find out once we've checked out? So much for privacy.4. The bed was two singles pushed together, and there was no way you could cuddle across them - the middle was hard as wood. We had to sleep far apart, holding hands across the bed. So much for romance.I am sure this is an unusual experience as everyone else loves it so much. But for a 拢500 night away, I expect more.

<Content>Brilliant stay at the Soho We really looked into hotels in London as prices are generally outrageous - especially with the pound so strong against other currencies. The Soho was expensive (305 pounds per night), but worth every cent.The room at the Soho (luxury double) was beautifully appointed and far more spacious than expected. The bedroom had large (openable) windows and a wonderful bed with quality linens. Bathroom was great with a huge bath and separate shower.The hotel's public areas are good and staff are friendly. The room service was of an exceptional quality - though check your order as both times we had room service they forgot something! The location is what makes this hotel one of the best around. It is right in the heart of Soho and an easy distance to everything.Thoroughly recommended. Looking forward to trying other hotels in the Firmdale group.

<Content>amazingly quiet considering where it is Firstly, this is not a cheap hotel (but then where in London anywhere decent is?).We stayed in a Suite for 2 nights and were very impressed with the quality of the room. Lovely beds and suprisingly quiet given how close it is to all the action of Central London. If you come home late on a Friday or Saturday night the streets around the hotel will make you wonder whether you are going to get any sleep. It is amazing however how quiet it is when you go one street back. The bar gets very busy but that may be half the attraction.

<Content>Great venue, small niggles My wife and I had a one night stay at this central London hotel and were very pleased by the comfort of the room and the very helpful nature of the staff. Finding a room in London for less than a ransom figure is tough - unless you want to stay in a doss house - but we both felt that we got decent value for money here. Bedroom was well appointed - top floor with balcony which gave us a good view of the Soho rooftops and over to London Eye - and theatre and cinemas are within easy walking distance.OK - a couple of small niggles. Air conditioning - and this is relevant to nearly all hotels I have stayed in. You really don't need it to be too cool in the restaurant otherwise your diners rush to get the food over with so that they can get to the relative warmth of the lounge. The weather the day we stayed was cool (55 degrees) and air conditioning wasn't needed at all but we both felt the brush of cold air across our necks when dining. One other small problem for those people like myself who don't use lifts (elevators) because of claustrophobia. I always take the stairs but here the stairs are not in the foyer or next to the lifts - they exit onto the forecourt. And for security reasons (understandably) they are locked and can only be opened from the inside. One has to ask the doorman or concierge to open the stair door every time one wants to go up to your room (coming down is no problem) which entails them going up to the first floor and down the stairs to open the door for me. They did it with smiling grace every time and I have no fault with them - my problem entirely. But if I was staying for longer than a night or two it might just be a bit of a bore.

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed in this hotel for one night in a deluxe room. The room was fantastic - very spacious with a huge, comfortable bed. The bathroom was very large for a city hotel. I only had breakfast in the hotel, but the food was very good, with a great selection, plus breakfast could be served 24 hours, so I could have a long lie in.I'll defintely stay in this hotel when in London from now on.

<Content>Really good but not quite number one in London Once installed, this hotel really has a great location. You can walk almost anywhere. But getting to and from the hotel in a taxi can be difficult. The back streets of Soho are not easy to negotiate in a taxi at any time of the day.The hotel has great staff; very friendly and professional. And the rooms are very nicely decorated with well stocked bathrooms and mini bars. But - for a new hotel - the soundproofing is dreadful. The street noise is not a problem but noise from other rooms and the corridors can be appalling. The rooms would really benefit from a small hallway or double doors or better sound installation or something to prevent you being woken up in the small hours by a neighbour trying to unlock their door or taking a very early morning shower or a trolley trundling along a corridor. The restaurant and bar are fine but not outstanding and the food is acceptable without being brilliant. All in all, I'd be tempted back for the location but doubt whether I would go back until they've cured the noise problem.

<Content>Outstanding hotel For our 10th anniversary we booked a four night stay at Soho Hotel. From the moment we arrived until the moment we departed, the service and attention to detail were unmatched. We negotiated a deluxe junior suite package and found the room spacious, quiet and delightful. The concierge service was great and the location was prime -- within blocks of theater, Covent Garden, Leicester Square, the tube and a lively Soho street scene. Breakfast was terrific, including a breakfast on the go for early morning departures. Overall, we were thrilled by the hotel, loved the service and would go back again for another special occasion. The hotel is worth its price. (One note: If you have breakfast inclusive, learn what's included -- and what's not -- in the breakfast-inclusive arrangement.)

<Content>Justifiably Number One in London All I can say is wow! From the warm hospitality shown by the staff, to the excellent restaurant (had dinner and breakfast), to the very well-equipped gym, to the beautiful, comfortable and quiet rooms, this is justifiably #1 in London. A stay just days before at the much-heralded Dorchester was a disaster in all respects -- especially in terms of value -- so the stay at The Soho was especially welcome. We will definitely return.

<Content>Fabulous boutique hotel We stayed here for two nights on a recent trip to London. We had stayed at another of this company's hotels on a prior trip (The Charlotte Street Hotel) and loved it, but wanted to be closer to Soho. What a treat! The facilities are top-notch, with hip decor, a great restaurant/bar, buzzy energy, and late-night honor-system snack bar in one of the ground floor sitting rooms/libraries. Our room was surprisingly large and surprisingly quiet. The hotel's gym was also surprisingly good, with top-of-the-line equipment. The hotel is at the epicenter of Soho's film industry and sports a private screening room, with a Sunday afternoon film club each week. We overheard several serious film-industry conversations at the bar and bumped into a couple of script-toting people in the elevator. The only disappointment was the strange wifi system ... you connect to the wifi signal, then call the front desk with the code that appears in your internet browser, then they do something to get you connected - strangely complicated. The wifi's kind of steep, too - they charge you 30p per minute, up to a maximum of 20 GBP per day. Should be free in a place like this, no?

<Content>Very Pleasant Stay Stayed at the Soho Hotel, prompted by the very favourable reviews on this website. I am pleased to say you got it right. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was quirky, clean and pretty large for a London hotel. Our only complaint about the room was that it looked out on to nothing but a brown wall. We will look to come back again and would be happy to recommend the hotel to anyone who asks.

<Content>Very nice hotel, good service and attentive staff This is a very good hotel run by people who know their business and what their guests want. The rooms are nice, well furnished and everything works. The staff is tuned in and attentive. The concierge was first class apart from the cost of Internet connectivity there really isn't anything negative to report. It is only when one sees a good concierge that one is reminded how important they are.It's an interesting local for a hotel but it's great only a short walk to everything in the centre of the city, right by the theatre district, a short walk to Oxford Street, Piccadilly and Leicester Square. Soho is full of interesting restaurants, clubs (Ronnie Scots) and traditional pubs.

<Content>Wonderful ! This hotel was wonderful and I would recomend to anyone who wishes to stay in a trendy hotel in London where customer service is key.Nothing was to much trouble for the staff as on the day I called to say I wanted to use th hotel to propose to my girlfriend and needed a number of red roses and champayne plus would be landing early. They provided a room upgrade and the presentation of room and gifts made if a very memorable experience.I would have to say this is the best hotel I have had the pleasure of staying at including the Burj and hope to return in the next few months.

<Content>Always consistent! after many stays there over the past couple of years... it's definitely time to post my thoughts.have stayed for both biz  pleasure - both and all stays being an absolute pleasure.LOCATIONperfect. walking distance to a lot of central destinations, restaurants, shops, etc. VERY centrally located...love that it's somewhat in a high traffic area...but thankfully tucked away off the main road too.SERVICEi can't say enough about the fantastic service...A+++. extremely friendly, personal, attentive  accommodating.ROOMSrooms are spacious and comfortable. beds are AMAZING. toiletry products are good.FOODonly thing i can complain about. very exhaustive menu  options, but menu can be confusing and could perhaps be streamlined? some standout dishes...some not so much.

<Content>Excellent service and style Tucked away at the end of a quiet lane right in the heart of Soho, the three nights here were more than I had expected. From the prompt and friendly check-in, through wonderful food in the restaurant, the Soho lives up to its ratings on Trip Advisor. The style is boutique, and the laid back atmosphere is a perfect antidote to the bustle on nearby Shaftesbury Avenue. Room was very well equipped, spotlessly clean and the room-service breakfast was as good as any I've ever had. Would definitely return.

<Content>A Wonderful Hotel - Loved it! The Soho Hotel is fantastic. We stayed here with our three children (7, 6 and 4) and had a wonderful time. I recommend this hotel for anyone, but especially for those with small children. My husband and I loved the attitude of this hotel - we had an early dinner and the children asked for something to draw with. About 10 minutes later they arrived with new crayons they had obviously bought just for the purpose. The junior suite was spacious and immaculate and everything was geared towards making this a wonderful holiday for me and my husband as well as the children. I used to stay at the Pelham Hotel, years ago when I was single and working, and now I really love that the Soho Hotel (also a part of this wonderful hotel group) has got every detail just right. I highly recommend the Soho Hotel,

<Content>Fabulous Hotel The Soho lives up to its reputation as No. 1 hotel in London! Now I see why. The luxury junior suite was comfortable, spacious and very well appointed. The marble bathroom was amazingly roomy with both a shower and deep tub. The service was courteous and professional, as well as friendly. It's expensive, but well worth it!

<Content>Great Hotel My wife and I spent a few days in London on a romantic getaway (i.e. left the kiddies with the in-laws). We could not have asked for a better hotel experience. The head concierge, Sandro, was fantastic, as was the rest of the staff. The rooms were of good size, modern (yet comfortable) and, most importantly, very clean. Flat screen T.V. Room service (available 24 hours) was fantastic -- prompt and responsive. Geat location as well. I would highly recommend this hotel. Negatives? Not many -- a larger clock in the room would have been helpful. Also, the cordless phone seemed a bit quirky (but I've had similar experiences in other hotels). Bed was a bit firm for my taste. Of course, all of this is nitpicking.Overall, one of the best hotel experiences I've had in a long time.

<Content>Perfect getaway The hotel was everything we expected.When we arrived at the hotel we was guided to our room that was prepared already.The hotel was clean and modern.We was in London for a romantic getaway and Soho hotel is perfect for that.The location was perfect in the middle of Soho but still in a quiet street.Me and my girlfriend are lazy and like to spend many hours at the hotelroom. The hotel keeps a large collection of DVD movies that you can easily rent. We did not pay anything to rent movies.

<Content>Fab hotel! Stayed at The Soho Hotel based on the recommendations on this website and we were not disappointed. It is a real luxury hotel and our junior suite was fantastic. The room was huge, immaculately clean and very comfortable. It had a big seating area and a lovely bathroom with twin basins and a seperate shower. The bed was really comfortable and we both slept very well. It is in a great location and close to Covent Garden, Leicester Square and Oxford Street. The only tiny criticism is that there weren't tea and coffee making facilities in the room - although we got complimentary chocolates and water.We would fully recommend this hotel and want to go back already.

<Content>Great Stayed at the SOHO the last weekend before Christmas, and the hotel was absolutely in line with expectations and other reviews here. Excellent service, spacious clean rooms and bathrooms, nice breakfast, great friendly service. Only small complaint we had was the bed, It was large and spacious but not all that comfortable, There was no down comforter, soft down pillows etc I have gotten used to when staying at the major hotel chains like Sheraton, Hilton, Marriott Etc. If they put some effort into a better bed it would be very close to the perfect hotel.

<Content>Fantastic experience The hotel is a little difficult to find but when you find it; it is more than worth it. The hotel is in the centre of Soho as the name suggests and is a beautiful oasis with every room individually designed.The hotel staff are among the best I have ever met and will do the best to assist you with any query in a very professional and courteous manner.I have nothing but praise for this hotel mainly because you are treated as an individual and as a special guest not just a number. I have nothing but praise for this hotel.I have stayed in many fantastic hotels and this is definately one of the best in the world.

<Content>Fantastic ! My husband booked the Junior Suite for my birthdday and it was fantastic. I am a big fan of Firmdale hotels and this is the one I wanted to stay at and I was not disappointed. The perfect location for walking around London. Beautiful hotel and lovely room, spacious, clean, quirky - just perfect. It was very expensive to stay here but worth it for the fantastic atmosphere, brilliant staff and the amazing vibe of the bar area at night. Residents lounge was also great after the other pubs have closed. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Excellent After reviewing the comments from this web site I booked the SoHo Hotel from me and 4 members of my team. When we pulled up to the hotel I was a bit suspect, but once you get inside is was a wonderful experience. It is small and lovely. The rooms are big and nicely decorated. The service and food terrific. It was a place I will return to on my next business trip to London.

<Content>excellent stay at the Soho We stayed for 3 nights at the Soho based on its rating on this website. We had a great time. We had a deluxe room which was very nice, very spacious and was very well finished . We were only on the first floor over reception but sound proofing was good. We had a 3 dayweekend package which reduced the rate by 拢65 a night and included breakfast which was one of the best I have had.The bar and restaurant are nicely done and the staff couldn't do enough for you. There was a small gym which we used a couple of times. There are also a couple of lounges which again are very comfortable.Its in a very good location off Dean Street and had a great mixed crowd of people in it at all times.Its not cheap but it is just what you want from a city hotel and is well worth top spot

<Content>I practically live there In the past 6 months, I have stayed at the Soho an average of 15 days per month, so I'm virtually a resident of the hotel. Because I am away from home so much, consistency of cleanliness and service are very important to me.The Soho is in impeccable shape; the physical plant is well-maintained. As wonderful as the facilities are however it's the staff that really makes the hotel stand out. From top to bottom, the Soho staff is gracious, attentive, expedient and down-to-earth.My only reluctance to wholeheartedly recommend this hotel is my worry of over competition for a room.

<Content>Great Place This hotel is definately the best place to stay in if you visit London and you need to be located in the heart of the city but in a quiete corner.The rooms are lovely decorated with beautiful marble bathroom, stunning shower and comfortable bath tub.First calss toiletry line and plus two small bottles of relaxing or energizing organic oils to be used according the time of the day or your mood.Rooms are very spacious, which is a big plus for London, immaculated decor and lovely smell.The communal areas are beautiful too, even the library or the living room provide a cosy atmosphere yet elegance and relaxing with an attentive service by the smiling waiters who don't invade your privacy but still ready when you need something.To be definately underlined is the staff at the reception.A young and professional team is at your entire disposal for all your requests, from dinner reservation to the tickets's concert nothing is too much trubles.One Sunday night I needed a taxi which was almost impossible to find, one gentleman from the reception took me to the main street awaiting with me taxi without leaving me alone in the middle of the street, even if the area is very safe, what a style.He probably get a cold the day after ;-)Before that I was standing at the reception awaiting for the cab and I have assisted to a very imbarassing situation about a drunk american, let say, lady complaining and screening like mad about the delay of the taxi, the way the same gentleman managed this pathetic women was very professional.well done.I travel quite a lot and is not easy to me to find a lovely place like this, with an good balancing between the service, the location the decor and the human touch.well done.AC

<Content>Great hotel, perfect location What a great hotel!We have stayed twice at the sister hotel, Covent Garden Hotel, and loved it.This time we wanted to try something else, and we were not disappointed.From the minute we entered the reception we felt very well looked after.The room was very nice, roomy and clean.The breakfast is awesome, and the bar is really good.And we find it very convenient with the drawing room and the honesty bar concept. The hotel is located in the middle of Soho, walking distance to almost everything.Theatres, shopping, lots of great small restaurants around.We will definitely go back to this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel I've stayed, at this hotel, several times and have stayed at a number of Firmdale properties -- this is, by far, their best.Great public spaces; smart decor; great service and the restaurant was fantastic. Love how they provide the NYTimes (folio size and double sided).

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Just stayed at the Soho for one night on Saturday after previously visiting the bar there. What a brilliant place to stay, attentive, friendly staff, fabulous cocktails and an upgrade to one of the beautiful 5th floor suites with the most amazing views of London.Location is excellent. can't fault this hotel in any way - expensive yes it is but what an experience! Good for a bit of celeb spotting too!!

<Content>Brilliant ! Just spent two delightful nights at The Soho Hotel. Location is ideal. Don't be put off by the rather odd Mews entrance or uninspiring views from the window of your room, everything else is simply excellent - very well-appointed rooms, superb food, vibrant atmosphere, and above all, the staff ! In 30+ years of staying in hotels around the world I would rate these guys as second to none. We have just booked a return visit next month !

<Content>Ultra Cool  Spent 2 nights at this wonderful hotel and the experience was very enjoyable indeed. It's quite hard to imagine that tucked away in the middle of Soho is this fabulous establishment. Upon arrival, the staff greeted us with smiles and were pleased to tell us that we were being given a room upgrade to a luxury junior suite. The suite was very spacious, clean and well decorated in a homely style packed with all modern equipment and luxury amenities. The only item missing was a kettle but apart from that you had everything else you needed for a comfortable stay. Breakfasts were excellent and we enjoyed the cooked food and cereals/breads and service was friendly and attentive.Location of the hotel is a major positive as we were able to take a stroll through the streets of Soho and Chinatown and you're metres away from the main theatres. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed staying here and will definitely pass on these comments to other friends.

<Content>This Hotel Rocks! Absolutely amazing! We had our wedding reception at the Soho Hotel and was blown away with the level of service, ambience and the quality of the food and drink that was provided. Staff were attentive, professional and very helpful in dealing with the many ad-hoc requests we had during the reception. The top notch service was matched by the excellent food and fabulous decor of the hotel - the events team really put on a great show, thanks guys!On to the room itself. We were fortunate enough to be offered a special rate on a junior suite as it was our wedding (this also included the parents of the bride) but rather ironically, as we were enjoying the party so much we only managed a few hours before we had to leave (reservations guys did give us a complimentary late check out but unfortunately we couldn't utilise it as we had to be elsewhere). The suites are beautifully decorated and capture that elusive boutique feel just perfectly, incorporating top of the range facilities e.g. B  O plasma TV's, Tivoli radios etc... and a very comfy bed, it really was so difficult to check-out the next day (and not just because of the hang-over!)As a Londoner, I very rarely stay in hotels in London, however, as an avid traveller and having been lucky enough to travel quite a bit with work, I must say that for sheer style, service and pure enjoyment, the Soho Hotel eclipses all other hotels in its class

<Content>Finally! A Boutique Hotel to rival the classics I am based up North but find myself in London every two or three weeks and this has been the case for several years. I used to hotel hop like mad going through all of the classics including the Dorchester, Ritz and Mandarin Oriental as well as taking the odd flyer on the Sanderson, St Martins Lane, Malmaison and the Hemple (what was that place about?) Now again I found myself going back to the odd one a few times (The MO in particular) but recently I have been opting for hotels in the Firmdale Group noteably The Haymarket, Charlotte Street and The Soho Hotel and I am now a loyal customer. Having been unimpressed by the style over substance of the Schraeger hotels I was very surprised by the depth of quality in all of the Firmdale properties; the service from start to finish, the FB offerings, the appointments of the rooms and the quality of the beds were all top drawer. The Soho has to be my favourite as I think the location is spot on and the atmosphere in the public areas is always half decent - I will continue to take it over the oligarch-ridden hotels in Knightsbridge from now on.

<Content>Lovely Stay Loved the Soho Hotel. We had a two bedroom apartment and I loved the decor. The room was spacious, if very expensive, the choice of fabrics exquisite. Loved the rooms of the lobby where guests could have drinks and tea. Lunch at the restaurant was fine and the concierge service terrific. My only regret, we were there too briefly.

<Content>Stylish, fun, and so luxurious - the Soho Hotel Just stayed at the magnificent Soho Hotel as a treat for our 8th wedding anniversary. We live in London, but still wanted somewhere fab to escape to without a long drive, and settled on this hotel. We were so excited, and were not dissappointed. The sitting room is very stylish - a huge room with huge furniture, beautifully designed, every detail thought of. We loved the honesty bar - such an array of choice, everything you could wish for. Games for you to play - chess even, try this after a glass of champagne - a challenge!! The bar was wonderful - we had a cocktail or two of course! The bedrooms are just awesome to use an Americanism! The bed was the most comfortable ever. We had a juniour suite - flat screen, huge bathroom, huge room, sofa, 3 chairs, curtains that block our all daylight. Just perfect in every way. Minibar - again stocked with the best of everything, candles, perfume...even a thong if you had forgotton yours!! The 2 screening rooms in the basement are stunning, Sunday films at 3pm - what a great idea! I would recommend this hotel in every way. I have nothing negative to say at all, breakfast was a treat also. A life experience to remember!

<Content>Fantastic hotel, definitely worth a stay After reading the reviews on here, we decided to book this hotel for a 2 night weekend break. And we weren't disappointed. It manages to have a very cosmopolitan, individual, upmarket feel, but not in the least bit stuffy. The staff were very pleasant, helpful and efficient. We had a junior suite which was a really good size. Extremely comfortable and spotlessly clean.Breakfast was good - great choice and quick service. We ate in the restaurant one night too, which was also very good.The location is different, right in the heart of Soho, but its good to get away from all the touristy spots and there are some excellent bars and restaurants to choose from. The Soho Hotel will be hard to beat and not sure I would want to stay anywhere else next time we visit London.

<Content>Hip and Very Cool As other reviewers have stated, the Soho Hotel is incredibly upscale and cosmopolitan without being pretentious. The decor is fun and whimsical, especially the two drawing rooms and the restaurant/bar. We had a lovely double room that had ample space to lounge in. Overall it was very comfortable and chic.The reception staff is friendly and helpful and they go out of their way to help. The concierge was good, but we were expecting more from a hotel of this caliber. When asked about theater recommendations and music venues in the area, they seemed at a loss for suggestions, which was disappointing, particularly for a hotel in the theater district. Also, upon checking out, we noticed that they had significantly overcharged us for internet usage and laundry services. They took care of it, however, and all was settled.The location can't be beat--I walked to most places I wanted to visit and when it was too far, I found nearby tube stops. Definitely a prime hotel for visiting London.

<Content>Relaxed  From the moment we arrived, we felt that we were valued as customers. All members of staff were extremely helpful, friendly and made you feel very welcome to the hotel. It was noticeable that they all enjoyed working at this particular hotel.We found this hotel to be extremely comfortable without being overwhelming, as one may find in some larger hotels. There is a relaxed friendly atmosphere, whilst the surroundings are classy and elegant. The lounges had a feeling of intimacy; people were laid-back and relaxing with their feet up and you felt that you were in someone鈥檚 country home for the week-end. As the hotel is right in the heart of Soho, it probably has this lovely friendly feeling, because of the association with the media/film industries.There is some much attention to detail. The flower/plant arrangements were all beautifully arranged and fresh. Whenever seats in the lounge were vacated, a member of staff would clear the table of glasses/crockery and plump up the cushions on the sofas. Nothing was too much trouble for them.We felt that this was the most relaxing and friendly hotel we have stayed in and that this is due to not only the beautiful surroundings, but also to top-class staff from the front desk right through to the behind the scenes people. We felt so well cared for. Well done 鈥?it was a fantastic stay.David  Anne Watson

<Content>Great Hotel It was our first stay at The soho Hotel, and we stayed in a Junior Suite. The room was really spacious, and decorated to a very high standard. The bathroom again was huge and really user friendly, all marble etc.. I was a bit disappointed with the lobby area, but the lounge  Library rooms were nice.The thing that lets this hotel down is the service unfortunately. We never got what we asked for, Ie- we ordered Freshly squeezed juices in our room before breakfast, but it took several phone calls and complaints to actually get them, the tea we ordered, never arrived, Breakfast was incredibly slow, 40 mins to get a bowl of porridge, no toast being offered even though it was included.(although breakfast is very very good here) Its a real shame, as this aspect really lets the hotel down. The location is fantastic, we walked to the Theatres every night and it was an easy walk to both Regent St and Covent Garden  Leicester Square.If they improve the staff training and maybe employ a few more English speaking staff it has the makings to be a top hotel, however our teenage daughter was in heaven, with all the Celeb spotting!

<Content>Once again, a wonderful stay. The Soho has definitely become our favorite hotel in London. The quality of the staff, it鈥檚 modern, well appointed rooms, the good location close to Trafalgar Square and several Underground stations, continue to make for a perfect stay when we are in London. We one day plan to stay in the nearby, recently opened Firmdale, but with each perfect stay at the Soho, changing locations just because seem pointless. We love the Soho!

<Content>Very Good At The SOHO Having recently spent 2 nights at the SOHO i can only say good things we stayed in a junior suite which was both spacious and very modern looking and clean The bathroom was large and very luxurious with granite tiles and worktopsThe breakfast and the evening meal we had were both very goodThe breakfast was included as part of the weekend rate although i think if you stay in the week it is extra. The evening meal was expensive although no dearer than other london hotels we have stayed inThe staff were all very helpful without being over the topGenerally we was very happy and would stay here again when we visit london again

<Content>Great Stay in Soho We are just back from a great stay in this beautiful hotel.Upon arrival we were upgraded from our Luxury Jnr to a deluxe Junior suite which was very nice.The suite was very tastefully furnished.With many styles mixed but all complementing each other from the furniture to the bed covers,it was a very large room going on London standards.The location is just off Dean street in the heart of Soho,even at the weekends sitting/sleeping in your room you could be forgiven to think you were in a country hotel as its so quite and just perfect for the sunday ly-in as no early morning rubbish/ glass trucks outside.We dined in the hotel on Saturday night,with no reservation and just after 9pm they managed to get us a table in Refuel.Good menu/food  service.The spa has 2 very good treatment rooms and are quite reasonably priced and offered great service.The guest are all able to use 2 fab drawing rooms with the larger housing the Honesty bar (residents bar),which gives a very personal  homely feeling to the hotel itself.The staff were so attentive,especailly the front office reservations team both day  night.All in all well worth the room rates,great location still with peace  quite and upon my next stay in London l certainly will be staying there from now on.Honestly l dont think any other hotel lives up the Soho hotel in the London area.Congrats to the Kemps who design  own the various Firmdale properties.

<Content>THE BEST London has to offer. . . The Soho Hotel is just fantastic! I have never stayed in a metropolitan hotel where the staff was more helpful--and they didn't seem to be looking for a tip--they just seemed to be genuinely enjoying their jobs and hoping you enjoyed your stay and their city! It was incredible. . .I'm well traveled. . .I've stayed in a lot of great hotels. . .this is one of the best! The staff offered us a lot of unsolicited help--very generous, very kind and still, very hip.The rooms are totally quiet. . .spacious and attractive, well-appointed, well-lit and pristine. The restaurant (for breakfast) was yummy. . .popular after work--active in the evening and still the guest rooms are silent.Great location for the theater district. . .easy to get around London by tube and bus. . .There's no hotel I can recommend more highly in London.

<Content>perfect easter break We just came back from 3 days at this wonderful hotel.The hotel:We liked the style of this hotel very much. We prefer more minimalistic designs ourselves, but thought that the very special design of the Soho Hotel worked out very well.The staff is friendly and would do anything to ensure that you have a wonderful stay. Can't beat the location - close to Oxford Street, Covent Garden and of course Soho is great for eating and drinking...The room:We stayed in a junior suite on the 4th floor, with big windows, allowing plenty of light and views of rooftops and roof gardens. The room was huge - double bed, sofa, tables and a reading chair, and lots of storage and floor space, which was nice as we were staying with our 6 year old daughter (plenty of space for her to play and the extra bed for her did not take any space from the design of the room).The bathroom was spacious and had a shower and tub and very nice products from Miller Harris. We also loved the dvd - not that we were in London to watch dvds, but it was great for our daughter to have a break during the afternoon - snuggle up in the wonderful big bed with some sweets and watch Narnia before going out to dinner. The hotel has lots of dvds that you can borrow. Other great things: Perfect lighting, radios from Kloss and flat screen tv from Loewe.Of course, this is Soho which means that there are many restaurants and cafes, which have air shafts and aircons and they do make noise. But the windows are really sound proof and even though I am a light sleeper and all those humming sounds really annoy me I had no troublesleeping. There are no street noises at all, because the hotel is in the back of a small street off Dean Street.Restaurant:We had breakfast included in our rate, meaning that we could choose what we liked on the menu, and if the bill was over 20 pounds each we'd have to pay extra. My husband liked the Healthy Breakfast, my daughter and I just had the continental, which was great - I'm not into anything fancy in the morning, I just like some granola and a cup of coffee. But I have to add that I recently stayed at the other Firmdale location in Covent Garden, and I prefer their breakfast over the Soho. Everything in Soho was sweet - fruit, muffins, croissants, muesli. It was delicious, but I missed some cheese and bread. But the last morning I just asked for it and immediately got it, so not really complaining at all...We had dinner in the restaurant the first night of our stay, and it was okay, nothing exceptional. The three course offer is good, but there are so many other restaurants in Soho, so I guess that we would not eat at the hotel the next time we stay here. In all we had a wonderful stay at the Soho Hotel. The hotel is very stylish and not what you would call a typical family place to stay, but we had a great time and will definitely come back - or try the new Firmdale location at Haymarket.

<Content>Botero Class Hi. I am Azmi and my partner, Richard and I stayed 3 nights at the Soho and we thought it must have been the most exclusive and classy hotel. Rooms are so poshly and intimately designed and equipped with fabulous amenities. Perfect for romance. The drawing room makes you feel at home with a touch of style. And the Botero cat just puts the hotel in a class of its own.. Well done Soho!!

<Content>Luxury in London Stayed at the Soho for 8 days starting late February and ending the beginning of this month. From start to finish the service and accomodations were top notch. The manager met us upon arrival, check was painless and actually pleasant - even with jet lag. We were early so they sat us in the library and brought us coffee and biscuits. The room was spacious and well appointed, as was the case with the whole facility. The location can't be beat and there's not a thing the staff weren't helpful with.Refuel, the restaurant was actually a great deal comparably speaking with a pre-fixe 3 course meal of 19.95. And, despite the discount price, the food was among the best meals we had in London. The bar is always busy with a trendy group of revelers. The hotel is pricier than other options but remember - cheap is expensive. Will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Top Class Property Booking:I booked over the telephone and I was very impressed with the friendly, down to earth manner of the reservations staff. Email confirmation arrived immediately. I had to make an alteration to our booking the day before our stay which was accommodated without any trouble at all.Check In:On arrival we received a free upgrade and was offered a tour of the facilities which was a nice touch although we declined as we'd had a long trip and were exhausted.Location:Fabulously situated just off Dean Street tucked away just enough to not get caught up in hussle and bussle but close enough to the bars/restaurants etc of Soho and 5 minute walk from Covent Garden.Common Areas:The giant cat in the lobby is very eye catching - love it or hate it. Richly coloured murals decorate plain walls. Very classy and individual.Rooms:Very spacious, light, airy and beautifully decorated. We had more room than we knew what to do with! We were on the second floor and had no problem at all with noise although we stayed on a weekend. A guy we got chatting to who was also staying on this floor and had been all week complained about the level of road noise.Bar:Superb. Very lively from early evening with friendly bar staff. Very diverse crowd. Great for people watching. Not as many lady lurkers or guys of a certain age looking for a good time than Long Bar @ Sanderson. Recommended whether you're staying in the hotel or not.Spa:Never got time, grrr.Breakfast:She tried, bless her..... need I say more?Concierge:Arranged our dinner bookings without a hitch but did seem a bit cold when approached for directions. A bit of sense of humour wouldn't go amiss, however if they got the job done so we'll let them off. Perhaps they were having an off day.Price:Less than some other hotels in the same category. Drinks not as ridiculous as some places. I have to say that this is the best hotel (in my opinion) that I have ever visited in London. Although the decor may not be as jaw-dropping as the Sanderson, it has a lot more class and a feel of luxury to it. The level of service also leaves competitors far behind. I have booked to visit this hotel again and will continue to stay here as long as the standards remain as high as on this visit.

<Content>spacious rooms we stayed here the first of october for a week. Since we were celebrating a special anniversary we were upgraded to a jr. suite. What a lovely, spacious room it was too. Plus, shortly after we arrived in our room a complimentary bottle of champagne and a bowl of gourmet olives was delivered to us. It was absolutely perfect. The hotel is in a great location also. Really close to shopping on oxford street and close enough to walk to covent gardens. We weren't crazy about the restaurant after a breakfast there but did have snacks from room service, which was fine. I only have 2 complaints and they are minimal. We didn't like any of the restaurants that the concierge recommended. In fact, we walked out of several places be cause we we the only people there and they didn't look very clean either. We got the feeling they (concierge  restaurant) were working together. Usually at night we would stop at the honor bar for 2 glasses of ice to take to our room- quicker than room service and there was usually some employee(same one always) who would watch us like we were stealing something.Like you don't mind paying their high room rates but not a couple of bucks for a coke if you wanted. He just made us feel uncomfortable every night. But, all in all, we would stay there again because it really is a gorgeous hotel in a great location.

<Content>Great Location Overall had a good experience, service was excellent ,. Restaurant food was only ok . Room service much better .Internet charges are 33 pence per minute , it should be free in a 5 star hotel ! not this crazy price. I complained and price was reduced by 50% , still too expensive.

<Content>A gem in the heart of London Beautiful rooms, excellent staff, super resturant. We stayed 2 nights over New Year, including New Years eve which was wonderful. We ate in the resturant on NY eve where the meal was from a set menu and excellent. The place was buzzing that night but the staff were so proffessional, still nothing was too much trouble. For location you could not better, we walked everywhere after our car was 'magically' stored for us!It was very quiet on NY day and we found out that the resturant was closed that evening, which was fine as we ate out at a super Thai locally, but wish we had been told this when booking.The lounge is very welcoming and the decor beautifully refreshing. This is not a hotel for children though, although we saw some being made most welcome, it is more for couples and friends. We will definately be going back and I would be most happy to stay at the Soho on my own as the staff really do care about individuals.

<Content>Best hotel in London. Fab! Stayed at this hotel last weekend and absolutely loved it. Really stylish. I have stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels in London and this is the best by far. Great location. Superb service. Great lounges and rooms. Booked by a Mr and Mrs Smith Hotel voucher which means I even got a complimentary bottle of Champagne. Will definitely visit again.

<Content>Very impressive. This hotel delivered all I'd hoped for and more. Location: it is on a very quiet, somewhat obscure side street just around the corner from some of the most bustling streets in the city. It is an easy walk to shopping, museums, and more especially to all the main west end theatres, and it was quite easy to get a taxi.Service: every staff member I came into contact with was delightful. From housekeeping to room service, concierge to desk staff, everyone was cheerful, helpful, and sincere. This was a breath of relief because this balance of luxury and design in a hotel can sometimes come packaged with either stuffy or haughty service - which is not the case at this hotel!Ambience: this hotel somehow managed to establish an easy balance between traditional luxury and elegance on the one hand, and chic, playful art and design on the other. Our room (a jr. suite) was incredibly spacious, luxuriously appointed, bright, and imaginatively decorated. It felt more like an upscale flat than a hotel.The food in the restaurant and by room service is not bad (the tapas are the best choice), but there are so many great and affordable restaurants just at your doorstep that it is not really in issue.I would recommend this hotel and absolutely stay here again.

<Content>The Soho The Soho Hotel is without doubt a lovely hotel - we have stayed in some of the best hotels in the World, and as a small boutique hotel, this ranks amongst the best......We stayed here on the day before New Years EVe and New Years Eve itself.The staff are really friendly and cant do enough to help and the Junior suite we stayed in was plush, roomy (by London Standards) and immaculately clean. A bed side lamp exploded (the bulb) which gave my wife quite a start - but this could have happened any where......Bar prices are a bit steep even by London standards. The one aspect of our stay which spoilt the trip and which would stop me giving the Soho 5 / 5 was the restaurant. We ate in the Hotel Restaurant on the first night of our stay.......the menu looked promising. We ate with 2 friends and I have to say it was pretty awful. The diver caught scallops had grit in them (therefore likely to have been dredged rather than hand caught) and were tough and over cooked. The Main Course was Goats Cheese Ravioli which arrived as two enormous parcels of Goats Cheese, which was over powering. The Restaurant changed the dishes without hesitation, but made no real attempt to make amends.........The bill came to around 拢400 for what was a distinctly average to poor meal.......Would we stay at the Soho again - Yes definitely without thinking twiceWould we have dinner there again ? Probably not - For passing interest, just around the corner in Wardour Street there is a fabulous new little Scandinavian cafe which has opened in December. Everything is organic and the food and coffeee is great! Cut through to Wardour Street and turn right towards Regent Street - its on the right after about 250 yds!!.

<Content>Wonderful Place for a Wedding Reception My husband and I had our wedding reception at the Soho Hotel on the 29th September and we can not thank the staff enough for the most amazing time we had during the reception and our three night stay. We arrived the day before the wedding and a bottle of champagne was promptly sent up to our room. The room was very large, extremely comfortable and had a balcony with views over the entrance of the hotel and the London skyline. This is probably the best hotel and hotel room we have ever stayed in. My husband stayed elsewhere the night before the wedding so was unlucky to only experience 2 full nights! My parents and brother also stayed in the hotel and although their rooms were not as big and did not have a view I think they found them comfortable, but a little expensive. We definitely had a much better room for only a comparitively small amount of extra money.The day of the wedding the hotel helped us with chilling champagne which we took with us for our red double decker bus tour after the ceremony and by the time the bus dropped us off at the hotel after the wedding and tour the Library room was ready for our one hour booking, complete with bar staff to attend with drinks. We had 23 people altogether at the wedding and reception. After drinks and speeches in the Library we went downstairs for a meal in the swirl room. Apart from providing a seating plan and flowers I had left the room set up to the hotel and I was totally blown away with how beautiful it all looked. The meal was enjoyed and praised by everyone and the staff were very helpful and were happy for us to roam about the basement level as there were no other functions on that night. Photo opportunitites in the two screening rooms could not be missed!A friend summed up the wedding as being very stylish and that was largely due to the Soho Hotel. The best thing is that we now have an excuse to come back every year! (Although I am also keen to try out the new Haymarket hotel this year too).We couldn't recommend the hotel enough for a stay or for a small party, function or wedding reception!

<Content>another great firmdale hotel Having stayed at the Covent Garden Hotel we tried to book again. Unfortunately it was fully booked, fortunately we found out it was part of a small select group of hotels. If you like smaller, independent, dare I say it homely type hotels, then this group fits the bill. Homely in that the service is excellent and friendly, not at all pompous and independently decorated, so not all like a chain. Having spent many nights staying in hotels for business it takes something special for another night in a hotel to feel special.On the downside when we arrived (4pm Sunday) our room wasn't available but we were offered complimentary drinks in the bar while we waited. We chose instead to have a quick sprint around Soho and got a call on my mobile from reception saying we had been upgraded and our room was available.Our luggage was in our room and a bottle of champagne on its way! A great example of how to turn an issue into a result.We had room service that night and the food was excellent and delivered in a timely manner. The room was large with a fabulous bathroom, a choice of 100 DVD's and a great mini bar. We had breakfast in our room which was delivered precisely on time with perfecty cooked eggs and plenty of hot toast.The library/lounge with the small (honesty bar) and board games accentautes the cosy feeling of the place. We stayed two nights and the concierge/doorman were great and very helpful.Next year they open a new hotel in Haymarket and we will be booking as soon as it is open. This hotel group is the perfect tonic for hotel weary residents.

<Content>Great experience! My boyfriend and I had to book at the last minute for a nights stay in London - we chose the Soho Hotel on recommendation and their staffs helpfulness when calling.We had a brilliant stay and the whole experience was relaxing and enjoyable - I wish we could have stayed longer.The service was excellent and we indulged ourselves with their afternoon tea which was delicious. The concierge organised our parking, congestion charges and London cabbie about town - nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them - even my too heavy luggage!Our room, Double Deluxe, was spacious with an enormous and very comfortable bed. The rain shower was like a massage and all the finishing touches were well received.Breakfast in bed capped off a fantastic stay!

<Content>Simply perfect - but get breakfast in bed! We stayed for a surprise brithday for my nother this weekend. My parents for 2 nights in a deluxe junior suite (they were upgraded as soon as the hotel heard it was a birthday celebrateion) and myself and brother in standard double rooms for 1 night.This is a wonderful hotel, tucked in the centre of Soho, with amazing design, excellent service (most of the time see below) and impeccable rooms.All of the rooms were perfect, huge, spacious, well appointed, lots of toiletries, hairdryer, shoe shine, flat screen tv - you name it it's there. The beds were huge, very comfy and the cutains proper blackout!I would highly recommend this hotel but would suggest you have breakfast in your room rather than in the restaurant. We had a terrible experience on the Sunday morning (too annoying to go into) which blighted what was a fantastic stay, I would suggest that with room service you will not have this problem!This is the second Firmdale hotel we have stayed at (Pelham also) and whilst expensive they are well worth it.

<Content>Absolutely superb My husband and I spent 2 nights in a Junior Suite for a break away from the kids. We always stay in 5 star hotels and this was one of the best we have stayed in, the main reason being - the service. The staff are superb, they remembered our names, welcomed us with a smile, were always friendly and extremely helpful. Best of all was the Head Concierge, Sandro, who went out of his way for us, getting long sold out tickets to a top show and recommending and booking all the latest London restaurants for us to try.The suite was large and comfortable with a sitting area and big bed. The bathroom was a little outdated in decor but very large and kept spotlessly clean. The public areas are beautifully and quirkily decorated making it a very trendy yet exceptionally cosy place to stay. The majority of clients appear to be celebrities or media types and yet we never felt intimidated or out of place, even though we are thirty something parents of three!Breakfast at the Refuel restaurant within the hotel was disappointing, with little choice at the small buffet, but as it was included in our rate we didn't mind. It might be better to stay on a room only rate and have breakfast elsewhere, although again, the service was exceptional.The only thing lacking was tea and coffee making facilities in the room. If you order hot drinks at night, they charge you a 拢3 room rate. But, as others have written here, you do get offered complimentary milk and cookies when you come in at night, PLUS free water was by our bed which I thought was veyr thoughtful.All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel as we felt very looked after and made to feel special by all the staff, relaxing in a lovely environment. My husband also tried a massage in their spa downstairs which he said was excellent (and he is quite particular about massages).It is expensive, you can't get away from that, but we felt it was worth the money. Plus, the location is great, right in the centre of Soho, near all the theatres and fantastic restaurants. We loved it.

<Content>Could try a bit harder!!!! We stayed here for two nights a couple of weeks ago. It was our second visit [so we must have been relatively impressed first time around] and our third at a Firmdale [because we had previously stayed at The Covent Garden Hotel, which did we like but, stylistically, much prefer The Soho].I booked the room over the phone and gave my credit card details to cover the cost of two nights [about 拢1k] because my partner was travelling ahead of me and I didn't want him to have to be bothered with having to use his card to have to pay [he would usually know that by having to use his card he would end up paying for the treat, which wasn't the point].It turned out that when he arrived he was required to present his credit card [not for identification purposes, which would have been fine] but for it to be swiped and debited. He didn't complain because [knowing me like he does he just thought oh here we go again]. I arrived 2 or 3 hours later to be told that he had had to use his card. So, being determined that just this once I would pay, and assuming that my card had not already been debited, despite my instructions, I presented my card.As events eventually revealed, my card HAD been debited before either of us arrived [I think that it was 拢1100.00]. His card was then debited on his arrival, and then on my arrival my card was debited again, this time for 拢1300!!!. That though did not cause the cancellation of my original debit of 拢1100 nor the cancellation of his debit [I assume it was 拢1100, or perhaps it was 拢1300].Anyway, off we go out to supper that night, somewhere nice and with guests. My card, the only one I was carrying then bounced because there was over 拢1k missing!!! Fortunately my partner had one of his cards with him and he paid. This was not a good start! Obviously the hotel were not going to overcharge us BUT they had reserved over 拢3.5k of our credit for a two night stay. So BEWARE!!!!Anyway, our room, Junior Suite was really lovely, perfect in every way. A nice touch was that when we returned from supper on the Friday we were offered complimentary bed time milk and cookies.Breakfast is a unique affair in Refuel.Am I wrong, but when you have an English breakfast in a smart hotel at 拢21.00 aren't you entitled to have some cereal and or fruit from the buffet? Not here you aren't. I had two Weetabix and a slug of milk, and was told that that meant that I was having the Refuel breakfast which would cost over 拢30, although, eventually I was only charged 拢21, but I didn't have any Weetabix on the Sunday because it's nice but not 拢10+ nice.These kind of details dim the shine on what should be a faultless hotel, and it is lovely, very stylish, generally welcoming, but it could do better if only they tried just that little bit harder.Shame really because I love the look and like the location and I want to rave about the place, but I have to be honest and so I have.Would we stay again? Probably yes.

<Content>An oasis within the hubub of London This was our second time staying at the SOHO and it was just as amazing as our first visit. The hotel is tucked down a side street in gritty SOHO. The 5 or 6 story building is a renovated parking garage with a masonry exterior with beautiful loft-style windows. I believe the hotel has about 90 rooms. So boutique is the category here. There also appears to be residential lofts that are a part of this building.Enter the lobby and you are welcomed into an unusal mix and match of a number of design styles. This is haute-design.The staff couldn't be more pleasant. No pretention. Just extraordinarily professionalism and friendly faces who recognize repeat guests. Which is what happened to us when we checked in and we were kindly upgraded to a luxury double room where a hand written note welcomed us back and some aroma therapy treatment was waiting as a gift to be used in a warm bath after a long flight. This kind of attention to detail is present at every twist and turn in this hotel. One night, after a long day and a late dinner out, as we passed the front desk to return to our room we were asked if we would like some warm milk and cookies sent up on the house as a late night snack. Who can say no to something like that? And the company should give their head concierge a big fat bonus. He was always eager to help. Getting us hard to find dinner reservations one night and trying to seek out much coveted tickets to Little Britain another night. Even offering to look on teh black market for us since teh show was long sold out. (Turns out it wasn't playing that night and we were leaving the next day.)Guest rooms are perfect. I read that every room is different. Our room in our most recent stay (room 405) was decorated perfectly (like everything in this hotel) with an incredible twoil-like (sp?)wallpaper, textured/comfortable fabrics, comfy chairs to relax while watching the flat screen TV (and DVD player), an enormous bath with a huge tub and separate glass enclosed shower and great closet space for those of us who like to overpack when we travel.Common areas are just plain quirky and plush. We had 6 firends meet us for drinks before we headed out to dinner one night and we used one of the drawing rooms as a gathering place. We had a waiter from the bar serve us and we and our guests felt like we were in our very own (albeit very grande) living room. There are 2 or 3 drawing rooms and they are all incredibly decorated. Classic British design meets modern. I just wish smoking was prohibited in public spaces...but soon I hear!The gym is pretty good as far as hotel gyms go. I'd give it a 7 out of 10. I have yet to find an extraordinary gym. Actually, I think the best gym in London is at the Meridien in Piccadilly, but I digress. The SOHO's gym offers great cardio equipment and a pretty good selection of free weights. Massage rooms can be found off the gym and I saw some relaxed folks coming out from those rooms as I ran on the treadmill.We have also found that the SOHOT Hotel is an extremely comfortable hotel for gay travellers. We've always been treated with kindness and respect.We will never stay at any other hotel in London. Well, maybe we'll check out other Firmdale Hotels next time we are in town. But I'd feel a little guilty, to be honest.

<Content>A must for the disillusioned! As a fairly seasoned traveller, having stayed at other so-called 'five star' hotels, the Soho Hotel was a breath of fresh air! It truly was a relaxing experience in a fantastic hotel. Location wise it's ideal for anyone wishing to be in the centre of London, but without the hub-bub which usually accompanies being so central: the hotel is nestled in a quiet mews. The bar and restaurant areas are separated by a very simple but effective glass 'wall' and this removes any possibility of the area resembling an airport lounge.The room was spotless and the aromatherapy oils left out (making me feel more than a little like Alice in Wonderland), with which to 'relax' or 'wake me' were a nice touch, as was the hand written note from the hotel manager.I don't often have the opportunity to visit London hotels, more often than not it's hotels in New York, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam due to work, but if I need to visit London again I will certainly make a point of staying there!

<Content>wonderful hotel I've chosen The Soho for my birthday celebration 2 years ago and i've forgotten to give you my opinion about this amazing perfect and wonderful hotel. I've tried a lot of hotels in the british capital but this experience has been simply unforgettable.Everything is fantastic in this hotel from the staff elegant, trendy and helpful to the rooms, large, extremly well designed, some with a private terrace overlooking the trendy Soho district and with a lot of natural light due to large windows.This is a true five stars hotel with high quality amenities, a rare attention to detail, an impressive cleanliness and an exquisite breakfast.All the public areas are very comfortable as well like the library where you can have a drink in a cool trendy atmosphere. The lobby is huge with a Botero statue so original.The Soho is undoubtly the best adress in London and for sure one of the best hotel in the world, better than the other hotels of the Firmdale group and in conclusion, one of my favourite city hotels.I want to come back soon to stay again in this world of excellence and originality....

<Content>A place to feel special We have just returned from this beautifully discreet hotel. From the moment we entered this oasis of calm we felt special and pampered. The staff were, without exception, very friendly and helpful.  The decor in the hotel is lively and perhaps shouldn't work - but it does. The libary and sitting rooms are havens of peace. The bar gets full in the evening and is great place to people watch.We had a beautiful room which was spacious( when compared to other rooms in which I've stayed in 5 star London) and offered a bathroom of marble and glass. The separate shower was fantastic and as expected was equipuiped with high quality soaps and shower gels.The view from our room and indeed all the public rooms were not great. This is because the hotel is in a Mews area and so looks out only onto other buildings. This did not worry us greatlyThis hotel is in a great postion and I would love to stay again. It is not as brash or obvious as some similar hotels but it is a truely classy place to stay.

<Content>Great Hotel, great location The Soho Hotel is a beautiful hotel. The rooms are modern with amenities like high speed internet, LCD TV's, radios with Ipod hookups (supplied by concierge). They are well appointed and the bathrooms are also very nice. The restaurant has an excellent menu and the bar is busy at night. Downstairs they have a decently equipped gym. If you are looking for a very nice hotel and would like to stay in the heart of Soho, I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>As Good As It Gets in London We are a family of five, and we stayed at the Soho Hotel in a two-room apartment for two and a half weeks in April and May this year. Let me say this right off: this hotel is as good as it gets in London: attentive staff, excellent rooms, a lively neighborhood with every conceivable eating place, most theaters and Chinatown only five minutes away. It is a little more expensive than the usual, but then the usual will not have a ten-foot bronze cat by Botero in the lobby! The hotel restaurant is, how does one put it delicately, minimalist, especially from the point of view of a family that can get very hungry in London, which is about ten thousand kilometers from Asia where we live. But having said that, I have to say that it was always full, especially around the very long bar which seems to be the restaurant's centerpiece. So my comment is probably more indicative of a cultural divide: Asians go to restaurants for food, preferably in substantial amounts; Brits go for drinks, probably in similarly substantial quantities. All in all, this is a hotel that deserves a premium rating, and a promise to keep returning to it whenever you get to London.

<Content>Wonderful We stayed here for our wedding anniversary and it was wonderful. The hotel itself, and our room, were both lovely, beautifully decorated - very stylish - with interesting pieces of art around. The bed and bathroom were both very luxurious and comfortable. They sent us in a bottle of champage for our anniversary, and the cocktails at the downstairs bar were delicious. Breakfast, delivered to our room, was also great, with an interesting selection to choose from (and much better than the other 5 star places I've stayed). Staff and service all impeccable.All in all a terrific place to stay - I have booked to go back next month and can't wait.

<Content>Great design, good hotel This hotel is in a great location (as its name suggests) and yet manages to be very quiet, as it is tucked away between 2 busy streets. The decor in the main communal parts of the hotel is very special, but I have to say that on a personal level I wasn't too keen on the decor in my room. We were upgraded to a junior suite, and although the quality of the furnishings was great, the decor was a bit 'old US style country house' which isn't to my taste. The bathroom was full of dark marble: very 80s. However this is the only real complaint I have, and it is purely a question of personal taste. I prefer clean modernity, not flowery.Be careful if breakfast isn't included in your rate - it was in ours but the a la carte would have come to 拢50! Plus the prices they quote for rooms is without VAT so that adds another 20%...Had a great time, it's a very special place but I would not rush back. I much prefer the Covent Garden or the Charlotte Street hotels.

<Content>Fantastic We stayed here on New Years Eve and it could not have been better. The reception and general hotel staff are the best I have come across in recent years - possibly the best ever - and I travel regulary on business staying at so-called 'style' hotels in NYC, Lisbon, Barcelona, Amsterdam, LA and everywhere inbetween.We were upgraded on our arrival and the room set-up was fantastic. The materials, fabrics and decor are of a very high quality and the finishing of the room is astounding for this day and age, when craftsmanship and finishing has gone down the pan pretty much (will be interesting to see how the hotel maintains this, as it is still new and one feels like you are in fact the first persion to ever stay in the room!).The hotel and fabulous bar area was pretty quiet for NY Eve, but we were going outside for dinner and drinks (the fantastic Quo Vadis restaurant is just 50 yards away and is always impeccable) so this was inconsequential.Compared to the other style/boutique hotels in London, The Soho Hotel has upped the ante a long way - it mixes new boutique style with 'old school' warmth, quality and detail - can only recommend it highly!!

<Content>Great Place to Stay My company helped to build this hotel so I may be a bit biased in my opinion. So with this in mind I paid for 5 other couples to stay at this hotel with me and my wife in December 2004. We have sinced returned in Jan and April 2004.My opinion and that of all the other people that stayed with us that first weekend was Amazing and ClassyThere is no snootiness about this place just lots of style and smile.The reception staff are extremely friendly and seem to have the knack of remembering guests names. The bar staff are also very friendly and polite. So they should be at those prices I might hear you say but trust me it isnt always the case no matter how much you pay.The rooms are the thing that blows most people away. Just how you would like your own room to be if only it was big enough. The beds were so comfortable i took a sneaky look at the matresses to see if it was possible to buy one somewhere. It was made by Silent Night and the model was called The Firmdale which is the name of the company that owns the hotel so they are obviously designed and made specifically for Firmdale HotelsThe bathrooms are exquisite with marbles and limestones.We have been very fortunate to receive a free upgrade to a junior suite on every visit so far together with a free neck and shoulder massage. They even remember you when you return and leave a personal little note and a gift in your room for you.I have read one report on here that says it is the worst hotel ever. Dont be ridiculous, try the Ibis Hotel at Euston.I personally dont think this hotel is expensive for the level of luxury. (Its good for star spotting as well: So far we have seen David Schwimmer/Ross from Friends, Robbie Williams and Busted). I understand from the Porter that Jeniffer Lopez, Sting, Madonna and others have all stayed there too.

<Content>beautiful hotel We stayed in Soho hotel for 4 nights this July. The service was excellent. Especially the concierge was AMAZING. He got us all the hot tables in best restaurants, best tickets for great shows...The food was good. The restaurant downstairs attracts a beautiful London crowd everytime of the day.Although we stayed in a suit, the room wasn't very big but it was pretty good for London standards. I have to say that the hotel was really really well decorated. The location was so convenient. It's close to everywhere you wanna go.
