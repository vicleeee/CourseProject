<Content>great hotel The front desk is very helpful. When I asked them for a wake up call and to make a cab resrvation he called right back to confirm the times. It has an IHOP attached so you know there is a great breakfast right there. The room and hallways were very clean. I couldn't ask for a better stay.

<Content>Excellent Stay For one of my first get away vacations to Louisiana, this was a great experience. I was so nervous reading the other reviews that I almost missed out on the best time here at the Days. The presentation of the hotel was so nice and clean I liked the location which was right off the free way and not far from the mall or the airport. The staff were very friendly and accomodating. My room was clean and comfortable, and when I needed extra things for the room they didn't hesitate at the front desk and made sure I had every thing I needed. I had a king size room and the air was working good. The outdoor pool was one that everyone enjoyed. It was great and the IHOP was real convenient and a store that was in walking distance. One of the best and I plan on visiting again. Enjoy!!!

<Content>A Good Deal I am relocating to New Orleans and have stayed at this hotel at least four or five times in the past year. I was pleased with it for my first stay and have returned to it faithfully with each visit. The rooms are spacious and it is convenient having a fridge and microwave in the room. The location is good and close to lots of shopping and restaurants although there is a bit of congestion on the I-10 taking you into town and the French Quarter. On my most recent stay, there were a few problems with the particular room we were given and there were no other rooms to offer us since it was Jazz Fest Weekend. A maintenance person came to fix everything and our stay was fine. There is a modest business office with two computers and a printer that was very helpful and we appreciate having the I-hop so close. We've never had a problem with cleanliness although a few times our room has smelled a little smoky. Also, you may want to make sure your AC works properly before you settle in. It seems like this might vary from room to room. Overall, the Days Inn in Metairie has become a standard for our New Orleans visits.

<Content>great budget hotel We stayed at the Days Hotel the second weekend of Jazzfest and were pleasantly surprised. The room was spacious and exceptionally clean. Everyone from the front desk to the cleaning people were nice and willing to help in anyway. There were no roaches in my room as reported by the previous post. The IHOP was convenient. For a budget hotel, this place exceeded my expections.

<Content>A Nightmare! Please take your family and run in the other direction! Upon arrival, my husband walked into the lounge with our 9 year old to get a beer to take to the room. He was literally yelled at in front of other patrons. We also had roaches in the bathroom! We got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and when we turned on the light, they were running all over the place. They had come into the room from a hole in the floor by the toilet. Nasty! In the morning, we tried to shower but the tub would not drain. It just filled up so we had to stand in that mess and try to shower. We complained to the front desk in the morning and the mgr. (Latoya Jackson), would not even come out of her office to speak with us. We couldn't believe it! They had absolutely no interest in speaking with us. We moved the next day to the Best Western Landmark accross the street. That was a better experience.

<Content>Great Hotel!! Great hotel!! Very clean!! Nicely decorated! We were there for my son's hospital stay. We had a bad experiance in downtown New Orleans so we moved out to Metarie for the 2 day wait for his surgery. Maintenance was great, front desk help was very friendly. I especially liked the IHOP next door, you can call and they will bring it to your room. I was very impressed with the cleanliness and the quiet atmosphere. We will definately start staying here when we are in N.O. I read alot of reviews and they were right on the money!! I will spread the word!!

<Content>Wonderful surprise! Being rather pickey about hotels, I often find that I am willing to sacrifice a bit of cash in order to go with an upper level hotel and -- supposedly -- secure myself the level of service, comfort and cleanliness I have come to expect when i travel. It has therefore admittedly been quite some time since I've stayed at a days inn or similar and I must say I am not only impressed, but to the point of perhaps feeling a bit duped spending al of the money I've been spending for nicer options. The rooms on the first floor, where my room is, have all been renovated to high standards. The room is spotlessly clean, has a safe, micro, fridge, iron, ironing board, 6 pillows on a surprisingly comfortable king sized bed. The colors and furnishings are well balanced and easy on the eyes. The room is far larger than one might expect and had a sliding glass door opening onto a patio as well.Staff was friendly and accommodating with only one exception where a rather young front desk gentleman (percy by name)displayed a bit of an attitude and lack-luster service. He was however the stark exception.The rate for all of this was a mere 59 bucks most nights with a mardi gras permium taking it to a high of 89 over the holiday.Amazing bargain for even the most pickey hotel visitor.

<Content>Close to French Quarter at half the price I went to New Orleans for the NCAA Championship game and had a great time at the Days Inn. Pleasant room at a great price, although a little tricky to drive to. Every room has a safe, microwave, and mini-fridge.A cab ride to the French Quarter or Uptown will run you about $20. The Derby (the lobby bar) closes down at midnight, but make sure you talk to bartender Shannon...she recommended some great spots. There is a 24-hour IHOP attached to the hotel.My only complaint is that the shower never quite got hot, just a torrerable luke warm. Oh, and that the Buckeyes lost the game. :( Still a wonderful trip though! Have fun!

<Content>Not for Business travel Since this was a personal business travel, I needed to have WiFi connectivity. My wireless card picked up the signal in the hotel, however it was very LOW in strength. I was on the 4th floor, thus thinking that the repeater was neither on nor unavailable. I contacted the front desk and the clerk requested that I come to the lobby and try and connect or go to the business center. I brought my laptop to the lobby and still received a very LOW signal strength. The clerk suggested that I use the Business center. This could not be an option since I have to access a secured VPN and the business center does not have the software I needed (only my laptop). So, if you are a business traveller and need to access yuor VPN via your laptop AND desire to do so from your room, this is not the hotel to stay at.

<Content>Surprisingly good value- glad I didn't read reviews before booking I was pleasantly surprised by the Days Inn in Metairie. As a woman traveling alone, I don't necessarily care about enthusiastic desk staff or a well appointed lobby, and am tolerant of cosmetic flaws if the price is right. My main concern is cleanliness, comfort and a feeling of safety. I was very surprised to get this and more for $53 a night in NOLA (with AAA discount and off season rates) . This place must have been rehabbed after Katrina. Some repair work was underway in the hallway and I could tell the bathroom tile had been salvaged and was older, but the bathroom was clean, the sink was in a more modern new, furniture style cabinet, the carpet, linens, drapes and spreads were also new and my non smoking room was odor and bug free. There was a digital lock safe in the room big enough for my laptop, a coffee pot and frig, and I wished I had brought my bathing suit to take advantage of the hot tub and pool in the courtyard. Down the hall was a fitness center, and the lobby accesses a cubbyhole bar and an adjoining I- HOP with pleasant morning waitstaff who were glad to give me a tall to geaux after breakfast cup of coffee. A security guard watched me and helped with my bags when I left before daybreak to catch a 6 a.m. flight back home. The only problems I had were when the outside vending machine coughed up a stale bag of Zapp's spicy crawtator chips one night when I really had a jones for some and the cleaning crew brought me two packets of cream and sugar for the coffee maker one day and forgot the coffee, which I asked for and received cheerfully. There is easy access to I-10, Lakeside Mall is across the highway, and you could spend as much time looking for a parking place in the French Quarter as driving from there to the Day's In in Metairie. If I had read the other reviews first, I wouldn't have stayed here and would have missed a good value.

<Content>What a pleasant surprise! Since we had been to the city prior to Katrina, and seeing and hearing all of the news of the devestation left in her wake, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised during my most recent visit. The Days Inn is conveniently located in the heart of the parts of the city that are open. It is very close to the airport and a short cab ride to the French Quarter. The staff was more than willing to get a cab for us on very short notice and no long waits for the cabs. The hotel staff is extremely accomodating to their guests, from the moment our cab pulled up, to checking in at the front desk, to leaving a very clean room each day to offering their expert opinions on places to go and things to see. A very nice surprise to be attended to by such a friendly, smiling group of people.The room we checked into was very clean, the temperature was comfortable and there were plenty of towels and washcloths replaced daily. The bed was so nice to collapse in--very rewarding after a day of walking in the heat!The hotel bar was a very fun place to for a couple of cocktails--the staff was attentive and the drinks (recomended by the staff) were delicious. Not boring, but thankfully not the rowdy crowd either just a nice place to relax for a bit.We did not eat in the restaurant, we ate all our meals out--wanted native New Orleans type food, which the staff helped us find.We plan a return trip to New Orleans in the fall and will definitely be staying at this hotel again! What a great place at a bargin rate.

<Content>Great Experience! I was unsure of the hotel as I had never heard of a Days Hotel but this is one of the best kept secrets in Metairie. The front desk was courteous. The pool was great! The bar on property is fantastic and I had the best night's sleep in a long time. I would recommend this hotel to all my friends.

<Content>Loved it I had a great stay with my family. I was a little concerned about some of the reviews, but my room was GREAT (room 344)! The whole hotel looked brand new. I asked the front desk person about it and he said that they had recently completed renovations including the IHOP restaurant, the bar, the fitness center and the business center. I will definately be back!

<Content>Loved the Days Inn! We stayed at the Days Inn in Metairie and had the most wondeful time. The rooms were very clean and the people could not have been more friendly. It was just a little outside New Orleans so the rates were great and the commute to all the fun was close. We can't wait to go back!!!

<Content>Good Experience I recently stayed at this hotel for three days on business. The room was very nice. Clean  comfortable. The hotel itself is a little stuffy smelling when you first walk in the door. That need to be addressed. The only problem I can think of was the hoodlums walking around with their pants hanging off their butts. I don't want to see that and I didn't feel comfortable with them hanging out in front of hotel.

<Content>Do not stay at Days Hotel in New Orleans - Metairie Upon arrival employees at counter were not cordial. They mumbled until speaking our room number. If you do not know, room numbers should not be spoken a loud or written on key card envelopes. We had to ask for directions to the room, they were not freely given. The room was horrific: We paid $99.00 for two broken down twin size beds. The mattresses, carpet, and room reaked mildew. Windows were unlocked, shower curtain was stained and mildewed. Quality lost us for life and we will tell all we speak to about it. Trust me, don't stay here.

<Content>Poor place to stay for business or families I was very dissatisfied with my stay at this hotel. The bed was too soft for comfortable sleep. The shower head was frozen on one setting. Several times, the hallway reeked of marijuana. Complaints went unanswered. I would not bring my family to this hotel nor would I recommend this hotel to other families.The business center had two computers for internet access. While the hotel asked guests to limit use to 20 minutes at a time, the computers shut down every 5 to 10 minutes, making it very hard to check mail. The printer was also out of yellow ink making some color prints look funny. Despite reporting these problems, they were not corrected during the 3 nights I stayed at this hotel. I would not recommend this hotel to business travelers.Some guests parked so they took up two parking spaces. Some construction trucks with trailers were parked diagonally in such a way that they took up four spaces. Two spaces were taken up by an unhitched trailer. Nothing changed despite repeated complaints.Visible from the hotel was a Cajun sandwich shop. On either side of that business, however, was a gentleman's club and on the other side, a place offering lingerie models. The neighborhood does not seem safe, is not a good area for families, and travelers would be very inconvenienced by the lack of service. Try to find another place to stay, the money saved on this not very economical hotel is not worth it.

<Content>Horrible stay This hotel was dirty, dingy and smelled in the lobby and throughout the hotel. There was no HOT Water and the linens were dirty. The prices we paid were 125.00 per night, when we checked how much it would have been if we had just paid through the hotel instead of hotels[...] they quoted us 89.95 a night. The room was partially cleaned and the coffee pot was not washed. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and we do not plan to stay there again!

<Content>I was checked into an occupied room! The first room we checked into felt like a humid, hot tropical jungle (the AC was broken) and the bedside lamps were both broken. The second room we got was even worse: the bed was unmade, there were towels and glasswares scattered around the room, and we discoved a condom wrapper on the floor. The third room was fine -- although the bathroom floor was grimey -- but we got there only after logging 20+ mins in the lobby dealing with the dimwitted help. Didn't eat at the restaurant there (Pasta ETC); glad that I didn't.

<Content>Yuck! This was a very dirty and dingy hotel. Examples include: dirty linens, lavatory falling off of wall (literally), and pubic hair on the shower wall and toilet seat. To add to the discomfort, both beds were tilting at a 20 degree angle. Lastly, there was no soap in the room and my request for some was ignored which made my impression of the front desk staff just as disappointing.

<Content>Poor Service from all 11/4/04My husband, 2 year old son, 7 month old baby, and I waited an hour and a half for the complimentary airport shuttle. We called repeatedly and were told the driver was stuck in traffic. It's 15 minutes by freeway! In the time we waited the OTHER Holiday Inn Select Airport shuttle must have come/gone at least 8 times!The one man at the front desk barely acknowledged me. Thankfully assigned me a room just 3 doors away from the front. My husband went to get our rental car, and the front desk clerk said there was no one to help me take our two bags, stroller, diaper bag, and 2 kids the 20 feet to my room door. I had to drag a few bags ahead at a time, and then go back and drag the rest. All the while, two other employees were in the hallway watching me offering no assistance.It took 2 phone calls the get the crib I requested.Pasta Etc looks old like it was built 30 years ago and then they added on a hotel around it. We had to walk our kids through the bar/lounge and smokers to get to the restaurant. The food was ok, not memorable. Our 2 year ate free, but we paid more than it was worth for our dinners.There is a breakfast buffet - pretty good - little pricey - NOT FREE. You only get one juice - NO REFILLS.We definitely won't be staying here again.

<Content>Dirty and dingy I visited in March 2004 for three nights, having booked through an on-line service that rated this property three stars on its four star scale. The staff was sullen, the hallway carpets stained, and the general area run down. My room was relatively well appointed with new linens, blanets, and towels. It was the lack of cleanliness that bothered me. There was dirt around the bed (large crumbs, etc.), broken glass behind the dresser, garbage in the Kleenex box. I tried to encourage the housekeeper by actually leaving a tip after my first night, but to no avail. The outdoor pool was mightly chilly, and the hot tub was not ... hot. Sorry, but I wouldn't return to this one if you paid for my room.
