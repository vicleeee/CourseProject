<Content>Wonderful Small Hotel and Location This is a terrific small hotel with all the amenities (free internet, great included breakfast, comfortable room, modern bathroom) and wonderful staff. It is on a reasonably small side street within easy walking distance of metro and various museums. We have stayed at many small (and some large) Paris hotels and this is by far the best.

<Content>Great location, excellent hotel experience This is a beautiful, modern, nicely decorated, very clean small hotel in a fabulous location off the Champs-Elysees; short walking distances to the Eiffel Tower, the River Seine, L'Arc de Triomphe, shopping, and restaurants. Excellent access to George V station for the metro system, or easy to find a cab, bus, or tour bus within a block or so. We also walked to La Louvre. The bed was comfortable, the linens were crisp and fresh, L'Occitane soaps and products were provided at no charge, as well as other nice touches such as cookies, chocolates at turn-down, and most of all an excellent, friendly, multi-lingual staff who truly cares about the guests and does whatever they can to ensure that your visit to Hotel Bassano and Paris are pleasant and enjoyable. I found this 4-star-rated hotel on a website. The pictures and descriptions are accurate of what is there. The lady who assisted me on the telephone when making our reservation was incredibly helpful, as she provided insight to the hotel's superb location, that it was newly redone, why it was a good location for visiting Paris, and she did a great job of describing the accomodations. She was prompt and efficient, as well as were subsequent e-mail confirmations. We stayed there four days/three nights, thus met several of the staff members; all were wonderful. Clearly, the management is doing a very good job in training all the staff how to properly run a hotel to make the guests want to return, as well as recommend it to others.(We are a married couple, living in London, although from the USA.)

<Content>Fantastic find in Heart of Paris Like others, I went to this hotel with high expectations. I was not let down. Their website is a very good depiction of what to expect. This boutique hotel is modern, tastefully decorated with a great location to get around Paris, and a great breakfast. It is pricey at 鈧?9 for continental breakfast but of a very high quality. You really do get what you pay for. Like all hotels in Paris, the rooms are a bit small so do not be expecting American size bedrooms even though the bed was kingsize.What made this hotel for us was the exceptional service of the staff who were very friendly, spoke english, very professional and such a change from the Gallic charm you will experience in other hotels in France.I'll be back the next time I'm in Paris.

<Content>Brilliant Bassano! Have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Bassano with my wife and daughter and can fully recommend it. The Reception Staff were extremely knowledgable and were able to recommend places to eat, and offer lots of other advice. The room was well presented, comfortable and felt spacious because of the separate area for clothes, and large bathroom. My wife loved the 'L'Occitane' toiletries (as did I!). Bed was huge and comfortable, and our window opened onto a quiet street. Location was great, with only a 5 minute walk to the Champs Elysees, Seine and Metro. Also found a great bakery just next to the hotel, perfect for a pain au chocolat and coffee. Also just a few yards from a 'Velib' free bike stand ( a really good way to get around ). Overall, it was an excellent hotel, with excellent staff and an excellent location. Ideal for a few days away .

<Content>boutique style hotel near arc de triomphe just off champs elysees Booked romantic package for 3 nights in superior room costing 975eurosChecked in at 11am  left bags behind reception with friendly advice that check in was after 2pm.We returned at 3pm after a stroll around Eiffel Tower which was 15 mins walk away from the hotel  waited 5 minutes to find luggage had been taken up to our room (41 facing north) . Pre ordered music candles  half bottle champagne, small fancy cakes,- rose petals arranged in heart shape on bed was lovely - we were here to mark 20 years of being together.Well decorated clean room with huge bed, seperate bathroom to WC felt like a small apartment with french windows opening inward - we sat in window with champagne  baguettes (bought at nearby convenience shop) looking on to beautiful french townhouse - no city views from hotel.Breakfast in small area close to reception - got busy with smartly dressed French business guests -very good selection - pancakes  syrup, pastries, toast, scambled eggs, fruits yoghurts,juices, cereals (plus more) although milk for cereal not chilled there was a small fridge with cheeses  boiled eggs.Found Paris very expensive due to exchange rate but worth it especially in the lovely sunshine we had.All the tourist sites had large queues but recommend the hour wait for Notre Dame 7.50euro each to go to the top (queue down left side as you look at the cathedral - the queue in the front entrance is for looking inside for free) and dont miss the eiffel tower lit up at night.Metro similar to london underground 5.30 euro each for all day pass.Go to small Orangrie gallery on the place de la concorde for Monets huge water lilie canvases - get there @ 9am  be the only ones there No sight of upgrade or parting gifts as other guests mentioned but good superior room with bathrobe  complimentary slippers  Recommend

<Content>overall a good stay We have just come back from a weekend (friday to monday) stay at the Bassano and have to say it was very enjoyable. Chose this hotel because of the rave reviews i read on this website so perhaps i had a little too great an expectation. Do not get me wrong, the hotel is very nice indeed and was a pleasure to stay in but there were some minor issues which did niggle a little. On the downside the lift was out of order for 2 of the 4 days which when you are on the fourth floor can be an annoyance. It still was not fixed when we left. Also although clearly 2 of us were staying in the room we were left only one large towel for 2 days (the clean ones are parked just outsde so we just helped ourselves to another) and the cleaners did hang my wife's bag of make up on the heated towel rail which went down like a lead baloon. As i am sure you will have guessed by now if this is the worst i can come up with then it must have been good which is true. The staff were great and hotel modern. We booked the deluxe (no upgrade offered as others seemed to have got) which was more than enough for 2 on a romantic weekend.If you do stay there do watch out for the beggers working the streets just around. They drop a wedding ring on the floor in front of you and then pick it up, ask if it is yours, put it on your finger and then hassle you for money. We had this 3 times in four days (luckily never fell for it the first time) so watch out for these and ignore anyone who aproaches you with a wedding ring.Oh and if you get chance and it is warm enough get a metro to Le consulat restaurant in Montmartre and sit outside and watch the world go by for an afternoon. The best afternoon we have had on holiday for years.

<Content>Truly Awesome Experience.....!! We stayed in Bassano for four nights on our trans-european vacation this year....I cant thank my lucky stars enough to have booked Bassano as we were travelling with 2 toddlers and anything other than Bassano would not have sufficed....It has been truly a great experience staying with them...Great and friendly staff (Who all spoke good English by the way!) went much beyond their way to help us out in anyway asked. The location was AWESOME with Champs Elysee, Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower all within walking distance. With two babies, it must have been challenging for the house keeping to keep up with our room, but they did a great job i must say...!On my next trip to Paris, I am definitely coming back here...!!

<Content>Romantic weekend away We stayed at the Hotel Bassano over Bank Holiday weekend and was not dissapointed at all. The hotel is in a great location, very central to many of the sites but down a quite street so not much noise immediatley outside your window.When we checked in we were upgraded and our room was of a good size and immaculate. The room was a little cold so when i phoned reception to ask how to increase the heating they said they had turned it off because of the time of year but within 1/2 hr a small heater was delievered to our room. The reception staff were incredibly helpful and had no problem making restaurant reservations or ordering cabs for us. We chose to have breakfast delivered to the room on both days and although a little expensive it set us up for the day. Overall, we were incredibly impressed with the Hotel Bassano and couldnt fault it one bit. Great for a weekend away when you know that as soon as you get there you are going to feel at home straight away and can get on with seeing the sites and relaxing.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location We chose this hotel after looking at several other good candidates on Tripadvisor and weren't disappointed. The hotel was undergoing a complete makeover and the rooms didn't look like they did on website as they are going for a much more minimalist look.Even though the work wasn't complete there was absolutely no noise or disruption and as an added bonus our rooms were upgraded. Our rooms were fine and the bathroom excellent with L'Occitane toiletries and large fluffy towels and bathrobes.The only odd thing about the rooms is that the only full length mirror is on the inside of the toilet door! In fact there were no mirrors at all in the bedroom although the one in the bathroom was good. This may not bother the male population but my friends and I found it a bit disconcertlng.The staff were exemplery and could not have been more helpful in every way and recommended two excellent restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.

<Content>Very Good Hotel My wife and I stayed 8 nights at Hotel Bassano in early June. Having traveled throughout Europe on business, I'm accustomed to small rooms and mediocre service. Hotel Bassano was a wonderful, refreshing change. We were greeted by Ali, the always friendly and helpful front desk attendant who made us feel at home from day one.The rooms were large, clean and well light. The bathroom was so very spacious, modern and clean. The bed was very comfortable, a king size which is not common in Europe.Location might be the best part of the hotel. Your minutes away from the metro, Eiffel Tower and other key tourist attractions. But what I loved about it was it was in a very quiet neighborhood, allowing you to get away from the madness that can be Paris.We'd stay there again without hesitation.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel Paris: The Bassano Hotel Paris. Fabulous HotelJune 2008Reviewer : A Trip Advisor Member Gold Coast Queensland Australia.Arrived at Hotel very early the morning of June 18th and was greeted with a lovely smile from Laetitia. Our room was not quite ready, but was asked to go to the breakfast room for a lovely hot cup of tea while we waited. We had a lovely chat with staff while we waited and was then taken to our room. The room was really bright and airy,so lovely and modern with new paint work, timber floors, comfy large bed and a very modern bathroom. Just loved having a bath with all the beautiful products that were supplied. Breakfast was really nice with hot and cold meals, the staff every morning greeted you with a smile and a good morning. The location of this hotel is just perfect... we have been to Paris many a time before, but our first time at this hotel and we would only ever stay at this hotel again.!!! The morning of our departure I was given a gift and a hand written card in a beautiful box from the staff I couldn't believe it.( It was hand cream) Laetitia at reception is very pregnant and we do wish her well with the new arrival. We will be back!!!!!

<Content>Loved the Bassano Our group just returned from a great vacation in France. Cannot say enough good things about this lovely hotel - we stayed in a 2 bedroom family suite and had ample room. Hotel Bassano staff went above and beyond their call of duty - they helped us plan an itinerary, recommneded eateries for breakfast/lunch/ dinner and made reservations. They knew our names and greeted us everytime we entered or departed the hotel. Our rooms were very clean, loved the heated towel rack, macaroons and chocolates left when at turn down every night!!!! They have a wonderful buffet breakfast - the location of the hotel is fantastic, the exclusive George V - metro stations within walking distance. Our group had quite a few teenagers and they also thought the hotel was chic! Our group agrees, we have found our home away from home, when visiting Paris, it's called Hotel Bassano.

<Content>Location, Location, Location-Hotel Bassano We have just returned from a 3 night stay in Paris and were fortunate to have stayed at the Hotel Bassano. From the moment we walked through the front door, to the time we unfortunately had to leave to return home, the staff at the Bassano couldn't do enough to make sure our stay in Paris was just perfect.The hotel has been recently renovated and everything is provided in the rooms to ensure our stay was enjoyable. The staff were exceptional and nothing was too much trouble. They certainly disproved our belief about expected service standards in Paris.The location of the hotel allows an easy (5 minutes at the most) walk to the Arc de Triumph and Champes Elysee and 10 minutes to Eiffel Tower.I would most definitely recommend the hotel to travellers looking for a place to stay that is central and provides exceptional service.

<Content>Fantastic! We arrived at this hotel very early in the day from an International Flight. Even though our room wasn't ready (didn't expect it to be at that hour) the staff were beyond helpful, offered us coffee, gave us information on all the sights and were very apologetic that room was not ready. We went sight-seeing and came back very tired around lunch time planning to sit in the foyer and read until our room was ready. The receptionist greeted us with a smile and perfect english and advised us that they had upgraded us and room was ready. After a slow lift ride to the top, we had a lovely clean, modern suite. Vaulted ceilings made the room a little dark, but the bed was very comfortable and the shower fantastic! No english TV stations, but who wants to watch TV in Paris - plenty of other things to do! The location is excellent. Only a short two block walk to Champs Ellyses and the Arc de Tiomphe. Probably about 20 mins walk to Eiffel Tower. Plenty of restaurants close by. Breakfast at the hotel was nice, but as with everything in Europe, very expensive for Aussie dollar. We chose to eat breakfast at a little bakery nearby with pastries to die for! I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough. Friendly english speaking staff, lovely clean and modern rooms. Make this place a must stay in Paris.

<Author>MissMesopotamia
<Content>Lovely and fantastically located We had a wonderful time at the Residence Bassano. We stayed there for three nights including New Year's Eve and found it perfectly located for Paris sightseeing. The Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees about five minutes' walk away. The hotel was quiet, and our room, though modestly sized was beautifully appointed with chic French provincial furnishings. The bathroom was big and lavish with L'Occitaine toiletries and fluffy towels. There was also a PC behind the lobby with free 9medium speed) internet for guests which was handy for booking onward arrangements.Reception was quiet and unassuming; we had no outrageous requests but they were cordial and helped us book a couple of tours. Breakfast was not included in the price so we only ate in the hotel one morning - it was plentiful and well-prepared, if a little expensive. There were a couple of good restaurants nearby. As swish an area as Bassano is in, (and let's face it, as lovely as Paris is) I do NOT recommend Paris for New Year's Eve. Reception warned us against gathering at the Eiffel Tower at midnight because of crime and 'hooliganism.' Set menu dinners at any of the nearby restaurants was over 200 euros a head. We ended up staying in and toasting 07 with Champagne and ice cream and were awoken after 2am by drunk revellers, and the sound of breaking glass on the streets outside. On New Year's morning, there were broken liquor bottles and more than a few pools of vomit on the footpaths around the hotel, in addition to the requisite piles of dog poo. A real shame, given how beautiful the city is and how important tourism is to the Parisians that they don't make more of an effort to keep it clean. Nonetheless, the hotel was very pleasant and comfortable, and I would recommend it, especially for couples. I do not agree with the assessment that it's good for families with kids - it's pretty elegantly furnished, quiet, lots of light-coloured soft furnishings, and doesn't lend itself very well to a lot of noise and activity.

<Content>small and stylish We enjoyed our short stay. Upon our early arrival, rooms were not ready. The receptionist had us look at 3 choices of superior rooms which was nice. We chose 11, one flight up so we could avoid the elevator and it has good privacy with a short entrance hallway. The lobby and the breakfast area are quite small . For Breakfast there were good fresh croissants and fresh fruit etc. The neighborhood of the 16th arrondissement is wonderful. Lots to see within easy walking distance.

<Content>clean boutique hotel with outstanding customer service the hotel bassano is located just off the champs-elysee and was within walking distance from the air france bus stop (line 2 - assuming you don't have loads of heavy luggage). while our room was not ready when we checked in (we were really early), they graciously offered us hot tea or coffee when we arrived.the lobby area is a bit small and the price of the morning buffet deterred us from trying it. when we finally checked into the room, it was extremely clean and well kept. i found it a little odd that the toilet was separate from the rest of the bathroom and it was in the tiniest closet! but the front desk was always courteous and extremely helpful. i had purchased a one-hour internet card and found that it didn't work after less than an hour's use. they gave me a new one in exchange.this was a bit of a last minute trip and many of the other hotels we tried were sold out. however for the money and service, i think the hotel bassano clearly stood out in a sea of 3-star hotels.

<Content>Bassano Definitely Above Average Stayed in Paris for 3 nights as part of a small European tour (London, Paris, Barcelona). I have posted hotel reviews for all these locations.Booked Bassano on strength of Trip posts. We were upgraded to a Superior room, and I am beginning to wonder if they even have an Standard rooms, based on other reviews. However the room was quite nice. Only complaint is the seperate WC (as most are in France) was right there as you walked in the door, and the shower was on the other side of the room. Kinda strange configuration.We were able to switch to another room for the remaining two nights of our stay. It has a much better configuration, with a small hallway leading into the room, and the WC next to the shower / washroom. Get one of these rooms if you can.Overall the hotel was clean and quiet, even though windows open to the street. Very soundproof windows. There was a few areas where the hotel is showing its age, a little paint peeling here and there. A staff member indicated the entire hotel will soon be undergoing a significant renovation. However it was not that bad and did not detract from our stay.As with the Chesterfield Hotel in London, staff here were excellent, and most helpful in all respects. Location of hotel was one of the features, and we were very happy with being able to walk to le Champs and many major attractions. For breakfast we ate at boulangeries instead of the hotel, and saved about 50% of the cost vs. the hotel. As travellers know, breakfast at any hotel anywhere is usually 2 to 4 times the cost at a regular local diner. Last day was a Sunday and there was nothing open, so we ate at hotel and it was very good. Had two dinners in Paris, Laduree on the Champs Eleysee (on the recommendation of Frommers, somewhat disappointing) and at La Fermette Malbouf (on the recommendation of the Bassnano), which was truly fantastic. Both about same price at 90 EUR for 2. Would probably stay again.

<Content>Excellent hotel We spent 4 days at Hotel Bassano and it was wonderful. We were upgraded to a suite which was an unexpected surprise. Other reviews have pointed out most of the highlights. The hotel was clean, well kept and comfortable. The staff were excellent, efficient and helpful, especially arranging tours etc.There is a delightful patisserie about 4 doors down from the hotel. It opens at 7:15 a.m. and a great place to get breakfast. Also a great restaurant at 11 rue Jean Giraudoux called ilana is excellent and reasonable. It's about 2 minutes walk from hotel.Great location, 5 minutes from George V Metro and Champs Elysees. 10 minutes to the Seine and Eiffel Tower. It is a 4 star hotel and I would highly recommend it. I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Good all-around hotel We were hoping to stay in a 5-star hotel in Paris but none were available at the time we were visiting. After reading positive reviews of Bassano on TripAdvisor, we booked a room there. The hotel is rated as 4 star and I think that is probably a fair evaluation. While the property is small, the Superior Room we received as fairly large and well appointed. The mattress was too low to the ground and was ready to be replaced. It was very hard and not too comfortable. The bathroom was marble and large as well with excellent L'Ocittane amenities.The hotel's staff is a real high point. They were very pleasant and helpful with directions or any other assistance we required. Everyone speaks good English and is easy to deal with. They even modified our reservation from a package deal to a Superior Room only (no included Internet and breakfast). I had read that the breakfast at the hotel was not as good as can be had at the Boulangerie right next door. That info was spot on. We saved 30 Euro a night by not eating breakfast at the hotel. The hotel has free wireless Internet in the lobby, so we did not need the 8 Euro per day wi-fi in the room.Notwithstanding the discomfort delivered by the rock-hard bed, the hotel was clean, quiet and a good value. If we were looking for a 4 star hotel in Paris, we would certainly stay there again. The property is also in a good location, only minutes from Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysees and Arc d' Triomphe.

<Content>Believe the hype Yes, it is as good as the majority of reviews suggest. Clean, comfortable, well located, quiet, helpful staff (a request for an iron and ironing board at 11pm was met within 5 minutes). Room not vast but with lots of goodies, and the personal note from the manager was a nice touch. And with a bathroom and (seperate!) toilet, both with opening windows - I think this must be a first. We had a superior room, so cannot comment on the standard ones. Booked the day before direct with the hotel, we had a decent rate, although it was August. We always rely on trip advisor for city centre hotels, and this one did not disappoint.

<Content>Great Family Hotel We are a family of 4. We chose this hotel based on the reviews from Trip Advisor. Our suite was excellent and quite. Nice large bath room (relative to european hotels). 5 Minute walk to Champs-Elysee and close to George V metro. Reasonably priced for a suite. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. Would stay there again.This is our 4th vacation planned using Trip Advisor - Paris, London, Phoenix, Las Vegas and Italy. The reviews are right on. Thank You for the fellow travellers and Trip Advisor.

<Content>Paris in August We booked only about three days before we went and I kept switching back and forth between all the hotels listed on lastminute.com and Tripadvisor reviews of them until I finally found a hotel that rated above average. Thanks to everyone to who contributed to Tripadvisor and therefore assisted in this process! Hotel Bassano worked out very well - within easy walking distance of anything we wished to see, just down from the Arc de Triomphe, 5-10 mins from the metro. I went with my two teenage children. This hotel has real character - it's not a faceless international hotel. Quiet street, clean rooms, ancient slow lift, nice bathrooms. Lovely and tranquil to come back to. Breakfast was expensive and unremarkable, but there is a boulangerie next door where we could get wonderful breakfasts - fresh breads, croissants, freshly squeezed orange juice, eggs if my son wished etc - for less for the three of us than one breakfast cost in the hotel. The hotel's restaurant was closed - we were there in August, and everyone tries to leave Paris in August - so we did not sample that. I would recommend this hotel - and especially the amazing Baccarat restaurant, Cristal Room, full of glass and mirrors and wonderful food in a square very close by.

<Content>Fabulous stay at the Bassano We traveled to Paris on business. The staff was probably the best I have encountered any where. They were friendly and helpful. Before we arrived they had coordinated a car rental for us with the office.Rooms were tight, but very gracious and certainly well appointed.Would stay there again in a heartbeat.Thank you for the wonderful stay.

<Content>Great place.. nice staff... tiny touches We got a last minute hotel room at the Bassano when we decided to head to Paris for Bastille Day. I spent hours looking at review but none seemed to meet us... we are family with 4, YES 4!! Young children.We only needed one room since our kids are young, we were worried as we read how small Paris hotel rooms are. After much research we choose the Bassano and we weren't disappointed. No, it is no luxuery American hotel, but it is classey, and Parisian and the staff was extreamley friendly to us... even tried to help me find a Starbucks by calling them, twice!We went for the Superior room so that we could have the extra floor space. It was tight.. but we managed to put all 4 of kids on the floor (one in a baby bed). There was PLENY of closet space, the bathroom was very large and the tub/ shower fit us fine.We had romantic flower petals in the bathroom when we checked in, and when we returned home from a long night, we were surprised to find our room picked up and beds turned down... complete with little chocolates! (Even in the baby bed!)The air conditioner was WONDERFUL in the Paris heat, and although our view was of other buildings, it was fun to watch all the going on's below. (And the bells chiming at the church nearby were lovely to listen to.)We found ourselves wishing we were on a romantic trip, however it was VERY kid-friendly and large family friendly. We will go back again!

<Content>Beautiful Bassano! We decided to stay at the Bassano on our first journey to Paris together. Our decision to stay here was based on Trip Advisor and we weren't let down in the least! This is definitely a four-star hotel within a few blocks of the Champs-Elysee. The bed was big and comfortable and the room is very spacious. The bathroom we had was huge with a big, overflowing bathtub. The bath products are all L'Occitane and very luxurious. We took a bath up on our arrival. The food is good; however, breakfast is not complimentary as it was at some of the hotels we stayed at in Italy (we loved that touch about those places). However, the staff is friendly and accomodating to your requests. We truly enjoyed our visit here!

<Content>Fantastic hotel We stayed here the weekend of the 6th July. This hotel was fantastic. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, going out of their way to make your stay a pleasant one. We had a superior room which was very large and very clean, with a lovely large immaculately clean bathroom. Linens and towels were changed daily. Fluffy bathrobes and slippers provided, and L'Occitane shower gel, shampoo, soap and body lotion provided which was a nice touch. In room tea and coffee, comfortable beds, small plasma TV, and the room was immaculate. In all the hotel had provided everything to make the stay pleasant - I've stayed in five star hotels which aren't as great as this! Breakfast was lovely and good value. In all a wonderful stay, and I would definitely want to stay at this hotel again if I returned to Paris.

<Content>Wonderful place to stay Searched for a hotel through reviews on Tripadvisor, and after reading several positive ones about Hotel Bassano, we booked a room for our family of five. The rooms are lovely, and the front desk was absolutely fantastic in helping us make reservations, loaning us power converters, answering questions. We'd highly recommend Hotel Bassano, and have even told our son, who is studying in France this summer, that when he goes back to Paris, he needs to stay there again. It's right off the Champs Elysee and close to the metro, so is very convenient to everywhere. Quiet street, and great location. Having adjoining rooms worked wonderful for giving everybody a little privacy, but being able to be close together. We almost hate to let everyone know how great this place is because it will begin to book up early and we won't ever get to come back.

<Content>A Wonderful Hotel in a Great Location This is a wonderfull little hotel in the heart of a great area in Paris. The Arc De Triomphe is only a few blocks away, as is access to the Metro. The hotel employees are extremely nice and accomodating, and the rooms were impecabbly neat and well cared for. We had adjoining rooms for our family of four and were very surprised at how much space we had, including the two separate bathrooms. The cost was very reasonable and from the significant shopping I did on the internet (thanks to TripAdvisor.com!) this is by far one of the best deals in the city. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>We were truly delighted! We booked two adjoining rooms to accommodate our 7  8 year olds and they loved it too. The rooms were very comfortable and the service was extremely friendly. The icing on the cake was the location - a short walk from the Champs-Elysees and a few minutes from the Eiffel Tower (even our kids managed it without too many complaints!). Well worth its 4* rating.

<Content>An introduction to Paris We decided to take our two girls ages 8  10 to Paris for a few days and booked Hotel Bassano on the basis of Trip Advisor reviews. We were more than happy with our choice. The hotel is ideally located just off the Champs-Elysees and the staff were really friendly and helpful. The beds were comfortable, rooms quiet, towels white and fluffy and the complimentary toiletries were lovely. Breakfast, whilst a bit pricey, was delicious and there was plenty of choice - sausages and bacon, cereals, pastries, yoghurt, fresh fruit and plenty of good coffee. The girls loved their hot chocolate and we were offered a complimentary glass of champagne one morning! Only onesmall issue. Having asked for adjacent or interconnecting rooms when booking, we were bemused to find we'd been given adjacent rooms with one of the rooms being part of an interconnecting pair. However the hotel very quickly agreed to swap us into the interconnecting pair and this worked beautifully as we could lock the outer door and freely walk between both rooms. Just not sure why they didnt put us in there straight away. All in all a great trip and hopefully the first of many visits for our children.

<Content>Everything We Wanted We booked a long weekend 15th June to 18th June 2007 to celebrate my wifes 40th birthday. There are are so many to choose from but Hotel Bassano appeared to meet our requirements. The comments turned out to be very accurate and Hotel Bassano was everything we were looking for. Staff extremely helpful and polite at all times. Hotel well decorated and spotlessly clean everywhere. We were upgraded free of charge to superior and the bedroom was a good size, with seperate WC and a very spacious bathroom. Housekeeping was faultless with fresh linen and towels, soaps and shampoos replaced automatically and the bathroom and toilet gleamed. Continental breakfast gave ample choice to get you going for the day. Hotel good central location and Champs-Elysees about 5 minutes steady walk. Seine about 8 minutes walk (Batueaux Mouche dock) and Eiffel Tower 20 minutes. We e-mailed the hotel direct and they booked tours for us in advance.

<Content>Really beautiful We stayed here for 4 nights. It really is a beautiful hotel. They only seem to show the big room on the website as a lot of the rooms are very small, but this is mostly to do with it being an old building. Our room while being small was beautiful. The walls do seempretty thin we woke a few times with people in the hall and closing their doors. It is in a good location between the arch and about 15 mins walk to the Eiffel Tower.

<Content>A lovely hotel. We have just returned from this hotel after the long weekend. The hotel was located in a lovely quite area. The staff were very friendly and efficient. Our hotel rooms were nice and clean and the l'occitane products in the bathroom were a nice added touch. Breakfast was very reasonable at only 12 euros. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would return there again however i am not sure i would rate this hotel four star more like three star.

<Content>Excellent Service in a Central Location Hotel Bassano has the most considerate and obliging staff I have met on any holidays I have been on. I stayed in Paris for a short break over the June weekend and I must say that all of these reviews on tripadvisor have been spot on. Hotel Bassano is situated about 3 mins walk from the Champs-脡lys茅es and about 6 to 10 mins walk to the Eiffel Tower. The rooms were always clean and you were never hunted out of your room for cleaning like in other hotels. It was cleaned when you were gone and when you came back at night time the beds were turned down. I thought there was a great deal of little touches such as the L'Occitane shower gels and freshing towels, that just made that little bit of difference. Last but not least , I must say my thanks to the staff. From the minute we arrived they were nothing but kind, considerate and are willing to help all the time. I will definitely stay here again on my return trip to Paris. Keep it up Hotel Bassano because it's nice to get proper hotel service for change.

<Content>Comfort in the heart of Paris Even though the Hotel Bassano is a lovely, historic old building, the best part of the place is the staff. Every person we encountered, working at this hotel, was pleasant, warm and very helpful. The room was a tad bit shabby for a 4-Star Hotel (just my opinion) but the fantastic location, the lovely lobby and the amazingly friendly and helpful staff, really make it a wonderful place to be. I have stayed in 5-Star hotels that couldn't even begin to compare their staff to the Bassano! By the way, it was also spotlessly clean and the maids appeared to be always there because, regardless of whether we slept super late or left early, when we returned, the room was always cleaned beautifully. By the way, try a massage that's given at their 'sister hotel' (just down the street)...it was in temple-like atmosphere and you feel like you REALLY had a vacation afterwards. My husband and I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Best Location, Best People! I stayed at the Hotel Bassano for business in the beginning of May. The staff was great and so was the location. The service was professional. The staff was more than helpful. The only issue is the price of the wireless internet. If you are a business traveller, be ready to pay a good amount (but that is almost anywhere in Europe).

<Content>Great Location We booked 2 adjoining rooms for 2 adults and 2 children. This was the final part of our European trip following stays in London, Amsterdam, Venice  Rome. We had never been to Paris before so the location was excellent, easy to walk to Champs Elysses, cafes, ATMs etc and bus stops. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms we had were surprisingly spacious and we felt we received good value for money

<Content>First class hotel We have just enjoyed our first stay in Paris, compliments of our daughters, and the Hotel Bassano made the trip a total success.The staff are the most friendly, helpful and professional people we have stayed with in all of our international travel. The hotel is peaceful, immaculately clean and in a perfect location for access to the fabulous sites Paris has to offer.While we were there they offered breakfast, served in the bar area, which provided a very pleasant environment to enjoy fresh continental breakfast, as well as a cooked alternative of bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs. Our suite, on the first floor, was spacious, clean and silent. The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed we have experienced. There is no doubt that, when we return to Paris, we will stay at the Bassano again and have no hesitation, whatsoever, in recommending this hotel to anyone wanting the convenience of a central Paris location.

<Content>Great Hotel This is a great little hotel about a 3 minute walk from the champ elysees and the nearest metro station; and perhaps a 15 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower.Its on a pretty quiet sidestreet. The rooms were all renovated in 2006 and they look great. I was very impressed by the attitude and service of the front desk staff. All front desk staff at every hotel should be like them!Personally I generally prefer to stay on the left bank; but if I was going to stay on the right bank I would book this hotel again in a heartbeat.Excellent hotel and worth all the raves on this site.

<Content>Great Place! Great spot near Arc d'Triomphe  Champs Elysee. Stayed 3 nights in an upgraded larger room w/street view. Quiet w/surprisingly large bathroom. Staff very helpful  friendly. Skip the hotel breakfast and go next door for coffee  pastries: 4 Euros instead of 17. 4 blocks to George V metro stop. We walked over to Trocadero  Eiffel Tower our first night, great restaurants on nearby Rue Marbeuf.

<Content>lovely hotel Really enjoyed our stay. Welcoming staff. Quiet hotel not far from the Champs Elysees. Rooms clean and facilities good. Would definately recommend this hotel for a stay in Paris. Stayed in London in Nov 06 and hotel was not at all on par with this little gem and was the same price.

<Content>pretty good The hotel has a fantastic location, just 5mins walk from the george v metro stop. The reception staff are very helpful and welcoming. The room was very nice and clean but I don't like the seperate toilet and shower rooms. The toiletries are beautiful. The breakfast is really good, with a good selection of food. The coffee wasn't fantastic and the waiter serving us not very friendly. All in all, it is a very good hotel, we will return.

<Content>Exceeded my expectations! I had an amazing and romantic first trip to Paris and a lot of it was because we stayed at such a nice hotel. I wanted a good location and a comfortable room and was very impressed with everything from the gracious service to the beautiful room (upgraded to a suite for free!). We almost canceled our trip due to other problems but when we finally made it to Paris and saw our room we wanted to stay for longer than we had planned. I chose this hotel based on the reviews I read here and crosssed my fingers, hoping for the best. Hotel Bassano exceeded those hopes. The suite was beautifully decorated and spacious, the bathroom was modern and immaculate and breakfast was very nice. I didn't notice any traffic noise but I'm used to a good deal of city noise at home. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Most pleasant stay you can have in Paris! There is only one thing to say about Hotel Bassano - fantastic! The location - the building and its atmosphere - and the people working there, it all sums up to something extraordinary.I travel 100 days a year all over the world, and I stay in fancy hotels here and there. Coming to the Bassano is like coming home, something I never expected from Paris.

<Content>Hotel Bassano is great! Excellent location, 5 minutes walk from George V metro stop on Champs-Elysses. Staff were extremely helpful and obliging e.g. booked restaurants, taxis etc for us (our French not being up to standard to do this ourselves!) We had a superior double room, it was always clean with fresh towels provided everyday. Bed was soft and big and the room was a good size, not small at all. There is a little supermarket on the street opposite the hotel to buy cheap bottled water too. Couldn't comment on the food as never ate at the hotel. Really no complaints at all, would definitely stay there again. A little going away present by L'Occtaine from the hotel is a lovely touch!!

<Content>Quiet Sophisticated Charm This small hotel is located on a quiet street, which belies its proximity to the Champs Elysee. The room was attractive, the staff friendly and helpful, the room service prompt and very good. I stayed 6 nights and did not have a single complaint. As a bonus, there are surprises like an offer of a glass of champagne to accompany a leisurely breakfast and a small gift on departure.

<Content>Good Hotel Very good service and central location where you can explore common sites. Clean rooms, friendly staff. With the high exchange rate, it is expensive for Americans - but probably worth the price. My wife was happy, so that is most all that matters!

<Content>Warmmmmly welcoming We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this superbly positioned hotel, only a short walk from the Champs Elysees and the Arc de Triomphe. Our room was large, comfortable and quiet and we had a sizeable well-equipped bathroom with plenty of little goodies to help with the toilette. Most importantly, however, the staff were unfailingly helpful, always providing us with what we wamted and always with a smile. Their attentive service will stay in our minds as a contributor to a very pleasant week's holiday.

<Content>Lovely, peaceful hotel 2nd visit to Paris. First time we stayed at The Novotel which was too large  very businesslike. We really enjoyed the position of Hotel Bassano in a typical, quiet part of Paris - a much more romantic setting. The staff are very polite  willing to please. We found the room delightful  very comfortable (it was much appreciated when we went out for the evening to find our bed had been turned back  chocolates left for us - a very nice touch). Definitely recommend.

<Content>Hotel Bassarno We stayed for three nights, the Hotel Staff were very friendly and at all times helpful. We are very well travelled, therefore we are in a position to make a well informed recommendation. The Hotel is clean, well furnished with good facillities. The hotel is a couple of minutes from the Metro (George V) and minutes on the Metro to all the major visitor sites. We will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful! The Hotel Bassano was far over our expectations. It is extremely charming, it leads you into an old Paris atmosphere with its appearence and furniture. Moreover all the staff is very friendly and qualified. The Bassano hotel is also very clean and quiet, and in spite of its little size offers you a good breakfast. Wonderful service indeed.

<Content>Brilliant hotel We have just come back from a weekend trip to paris and stayed at the Hotel Bassano. The location is great, close (5 min walk) to the arc de triomphe/champs eleyses and the george V metro station. We stayed in a superior room which was well equipped but in some areas a little worn. The maid service was wonderful with the bed made and turned down every night. (The chocolates were lovely).The staff at the hotel were very very friendly. They always had a smile on their faces and couldn't do enough for you. They recommended an italian restaurant to us, called Findi, which was fabulous and not expensive. 30 euros for a 3 course meal and free champagne.When we go back to paris we will defintaly go back to this very charming hotel. Internet access was free.

<Content>Overpriced and disappointing I booked this hotel partly on the basis of tripadvisor reviews and have got to say I was very disappointed. The fifth floor superior room was cramped, stuffy, with dated decor and two single beds pushed together to make a double. The hot water did not work properly and we had to boil several kettles to run a hot bath. For 280 euros a night (not including breakfast) it was bordering on ridiculous. Overpriced and not recommended

<Content>Very Friendly Service From the moment we stepped into the Hotel Bassano, the staff were almost embarrassingly friendly! Nothing was too much trouble and they even changed our room at the last minute.The room was lovely without being over lavish, with a huge bathroom and separate toilet, and it was very clean, quiet and private.The hotel is in a perfect position for sight seeing, and the Rue Bassano is very quiet, so you get the best of both worlds. There were planty of great restaurants within easy walking distance, so no cabs needed and when we wanted to go further afield, the hotel staff were very helpful in making reservations and recommendations.We will definatley be going back.

<Content>Convenient and cozy My mom, sister and I, and our two children (ages 9 and 3) stayed in late Oct 2006. The hotel was very cozy with friendly service, and very conveniently located. We had the family suite -- two rooms connecting. Rooms were a bit on the small side, with one room having very little natural light, and the carpets seemed a bit dusty. However, the location was brilliant, and the price very reasonable.The Champs Elysees was five minutes walk, and the Eiffel Tower was about 10-15 minutes walk. Both the Louvre and Notre Dame are too far to walk to from the hotel (with two children), but the metro was very convenient. The metro stop is on the Champs (5 minutes away). As the kids were usually tired by the end of the day, it was really great that a very good Thai (Chinese) restaurant was right next door to the hotel; the stir fried vegetables, pan fried dumplings, are quite tasty, and priced very reasonably. And, for breakfast, would recommend the Cafe Paris on Champs Elysees.

<Content>Great, friendly little hotel Quiet, 5 story, 32 room, hotel with tiny slow elevator. King Sized bed was wide but only the length of a standard bed. I'm 5' 10 and my feet hung over a bit, so tall people beware! Staff was friendly, helpful, efficient and spoke reasonably good English. Room was larger than we expected with lots of storage space. Presence of an entry hall provided an even more spacious feel. Unusual hair dryer with hose and head resembling a vacuum cleaner had insufficient drying power. Shower was awkward to use, but the large bath towels were nice and soft. Short phone calls to the US were affordable at 0.35 Euros/min. Laptop computer off lobby provided free internet access, but the European keyboard was difficult for me to use. Breakfast was good, but a bit expensive at 12 Euros for continental and 18 Euros for full breakfast. We were unable to locate cafes serving full breakfast in the area. Location was close to Champs Elysses but somewhat remote from Louvre and Notre Dame

<Content>Very nice stay We had a very nice three-night stay here in late September. The room was very comfortable and quiet. We didn鈥檛鈥?hear any noise from the street or from the other rooms. The air conditioning worked fine on a warm afternoon. The d茅cor was tasteful and the storage was adequate. The bathroom, while well equipped, was small even by Paris standards. Having stayed at the Hotel San Gregoire (6th) at the beginning of our trip, we had been spoiled by a larger bathroom. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The neighborhood was safe and a brief walk from the Champs Elysees and the Metro. We didn鈥檛 try the breakfast, but there were a number of cafes close by. I would highly recommend this hotel for people wanting to stay on the Right Bank and close to the Champs Elysees. We tried three restaurants during our stay here with mixed results. We had a great time at the L鈥橝ngle du Faubourg (the second line restaurant of the three star Taillevent), which is a brisk 15-minute walk from the hotel. The food, the service, and the atmosphere were all top notch. They have a great 35 Euro menu at dinner, but you have to ask for it. It is posted outside, but the printed menu presented at table mentions only the 70 Euro menu and the expensive a la carte. The less expensive pre-fix menu is three courses and well worth asking for.Our impressions of the other restaurants we tried were mixed. The Citrus Etoile near the Arc de Triomphe was like being at home-California cuisine. The chef here had done a ten-year stint in southern California. The place is lots of fun and the chef鈥檚 US-born wife, a former model, runs the dining room. The first course of smoked Scottish salmon was out of this world, but the main course of roasted salmon was less appealing. Maybe it was too hard an act to follow after the wonderful first course or maybe I had too much salmon. The dessert of fresh sorbets was very good. I recommend going here because of the smoked salmon, a good wine list (2004 Domaine Laroche Chablis for 30 Euro), the pleasant atmosphere and the caring service. The lighter touch on the food might be an interesting change if one has been dining on richer, more traditional cuisine.The third night we dined at Flora, a five-minute walk from the hotel. The experience here was bizarre. We arrived on time for our 9:00 P.M. reservation, but it took an hour to get any food. The staff seemed overwhelmed by the packed restaurant. The first course, a fish soup, was tasty, but things went downhill from there. We had been tempted by the menu description of a fresh swordfish brochette. However, when the meal arrived, we found an over-cooked piece of fish that had been coated with not very interesting spices with a skewer stuck through it. My wife could not finish her meal. The waitress inquired as to why she didn鈥檛 finish her meal. To our regret, we told her that the fish was dried out. The waitress immediately picked up the plate, took my wife鈥檚 fork and began mashing the leftover fish into a mushy paste. From then on, we were practically ignored.Our dessert was brought in silence and we never offered coffee. At the end of the meal the chef came out and greeted each table. If my French had been better, I would have tried to complain. At that point, we just wanted to leave. I had to retrieve our coats from the cloak closet, as none of the staff was around to help. I strongly suggest you avoid Flora.

<Content>Excellent friendly hotel Excellent hotel! I was really impressed with my stay at the Bassano. The check in was quick and easy and we were upgraded to a superior room, which was a nice surprise! The room was clean and cosy with a lovely marble bathroom. It is in an ideal location and the staff were very helpful in giving information about local attractions and places to eat etc.I would definitely stay here again, a good value for money and a comfortable stay at the Bassano!

<Content>Average hotel Hotel is very good if you are looking for something well priced for the location. It is only 5 min walk from the champs Elysees!! However if you want something with a little bit more class, it isn't the right hotel. Rooms are spacious but a bit dated (but clean). I was really impressed with the hotel in general but I was looking for something more classy. So I would only recommend the place for people who are looking for somewhere where to stay.

<Content>Just Fantastic!! C'est Formidable!! To put this in perspective, my new husband, my son and my brother and girlfriend arrived in Hotel Bassano straight from a superior room in Disneyland Hotel. This little hotel therefore had a lot to live up to. And it did. And how! We were given an early check in to our suite. I'm not telling you the room number since I want to try as much as possible to ensure that it is available when we want to go back!Our suite had a bedroom, a sitting room with a fold out double sofa bed and a kitchenette with a fridge. Not a mini bar, although it served that purpose as well but a fridge. As a mother travelling with her son, this was the icing on the cake. I could wash bubba's bottles and store his milk and food hygienically which is more than I can say for the Disneyland Hotel. There was a huge bathroom and a separate toilet, clever people!Our bed was scattered with flower petals when we arrived. We ooh-ed and aah-ed over the rooms and went out. 5 minutes later saw us posing in front of the Arc de Triomphe following a leisurely stroll down Champs Elyssee. The location is perfect for sightseeing and aimless wandering around the heart of Paris. The staff are the best I have found anywhere. They cannot do enough for their guests. They all speak great English which is just as well as my schoolgirl French was a little embarrassing!To any future guests, be careful which hotel you book as there are two hotel Bassanos directly across from each other. Since I haven't stayed in the other one I鈥檓 not going to comment on it but this review is about the 4 star one at 15 rue de Bassano. I could write about this hotel forever. In the same fortnight we had stayed in the Waldorf Astoria in New York and as mentioned, Disneyland Hotel and in a nutshell this hotel wipes the floor with both of them. Give yourself a present and stay here. It's now joined my list of 'Reasons to go to Paris'!I will post pictures later but can confirm that unlike other hotel websites, what you see on the hotel Bassano website is exactly what you get. And more..

<Content>Wonderful gem in the heart of Paris I chose this hotel solely on the reviews I read on tripadvisor.com. I was not disappointed. The welcome was warm, the room was beautifully decorated, spacious, elegant and clean. It is the best hotel I have used in Paris and will definitely return. It is well-located for the main tourist sites and the staff could not be more helpful. The only minor whinge is that there is no socket for a hairdryer any where near a mirror. However, a luxurious bathroom does go some way to making up for this shortcoming.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Great location We have booked this hotel based on other reviews on Trip Advisor. This was the only hotel with nothing negative in the reviews. It also provided accomodations for four people which was what we were looking for. Extremely clean, spacious rooms with beautiful decor, very nice marble bathrooms with bathroom robes. The staff was very friendly, helpful and always there for you to answer any questions or to book any restaurant. Breakfast was lovely (it was included in our price) and served in a nice breakfast area. I just cannot find anything bad to say. Big windows opened to a very quiet small street. The metro station was a short walk (right on Champs Elysees). Great restaurants nearby, Asian is a must. Very friendly service and amazing food. I highly recommend the hotel and the restaurant.

<Content>Comfortable hotel, great location We decided to go to Paris on the spur of the moment - we had planned 3 nights in the Loire as part of a 2 week trip around France, but were not happy with our hotel, the weather was closing in, and we'd seen the chateaux we wanted, so that evening (fulled by a chablis or 2!) we decided to have the weekend in Paris. The next morning we gave ourselves 30 mins to find a hotel, saw the Bassano on lastminute and immediately checked the tripadvisor reviews. Within 10 mins we were booked in and on our way. The hotel was in a great location (though driving around the Arc de Triomph to get onto the Champs Elysees was, erm, interesting!). Our welcome at the reception was extremely friendly, and we were very pleased to be shown to a bright, spacious, nicely furnished room.We stayed for 2 nights, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. There was always a cheerful smile when we returned, and we were sad to leave. Good value for money, and a short walk to many attractions. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, but the menu looked extensive, and the breakfast room/bar was bright and welcoming.

<Content>Great Location My husband and I only had one night in Paris and stayed here based on TA reviews. The place was great -clean room, well lit by huge windows with french doors. Bathroom marble, clean and good size for European room. Staff attentive, concierge good with reservations  taxis.Many brassiers and cafes are all around -if you do not like what you see, walk for 2 minutes and there are a ton more. The location is in a beautiful upscale neighborhood -fun to walk around and look at the apartment buildings. Long, but beautiful walk along the Seine to Louvre. Easy walk down the street to George Bar at the Four Seasons.Overall Bassano great hotel, not 5 star luxury, but more than fair price for what you get.Would stay here again

<Content>Good I selected the Bassano for a business trip based on TA reviews. A couple of thoughts...This is more a tourist class hotel. I did like the scratch off Internet cards available from the front desk. There is wireless available, plus one pc in the hotel lobby.Because I was there in August, the rate was pretty low--150 euros a night, which included breakfast. The breakfast room is nice, and all the standard fare is on offer (bread, cheese, ham, yogurt, cereal, juice, plus scrambled eggs and sausage)The location is convenient to a metro, the George V. The bathroom was huge--mine had a shower, bidet, and sink in one room, toilet in another. Cable TVMinibarSafeVery pleasant staff.The bed was a little futon-esque, but the pillows were nice. Generous bath products. I think if I were staying here as a tourist, I would have had a very different experience. I got the sense that the staff are very very helpful and friendly. I didn't utilize them much except for a dinner recommendation. So my general thought is that this is a nice place, but given it's ranking, I was expecting something a little crisper. This is a comfortable hotel.

<Content>Quiet and comfortable We chose to stay at the Bassano because of the reviews on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed. Our room was a really good size and very comfortable. Being situated on a small street near the Champs Elysee, it was lovely and quiet - perfect for some lazy mornings - especially as breakfast is served until a very civilised 10:30am. Breakfast was included in our rate and was very comprehensive with a great cold buffet selection as well as hot eggs, bacon, toast etc. We found everyone very friendly and helpful both by email before our trip and in person during our stay - we will definitely stay again.

<Content>Service and location Booked on basis of previous trip advisor reviews and we were not disappointed. Quiet location approx 200m from Champs Elysees and ideally situated for tourists.Service from staff was excellent and included welcoming by name when we arrived, advice on directions, booking a trip for us.Room was on 5th floor, and a good size with large ensuite. Nice touches included curtains drawn, bed turned down and bathrobes replaced when we had gone out for an evening meal.Breakfast was pricey at 12 Euro for a continental but good pastry shop literally next door.

<Content>Great Value, Great People Lovely, small hotel on a quiet street a few blocks from the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysee. Short walk to convenient Metro stop. Comfortable rooms with very nice bathrooms. Best of all was the bed and breakfast feel. The very friendly staff at the hotel got to know us within 24 hours and anticipated our need for wake up calls, directions and advice. And the price was right. You'd pay three times as much for a large luxury hotel in noiser locations a few blocks away!

<Content>Great hotel, poor airconditioning We stayed at the suite in this hotel on our second visit to Paris in June. The staff was friendly and the room was nice and large with a separate living room where the kids could sleep on the sofa bed. Everything was great except that the airconditioning was almost non-existent. As the temperatures hit 35 degrees, we could barely sleep at night because it was so hot. Thankfully, the second night the staff brought portable airconditioners which helped to cool the rooms. The location was great for walking to the Champs Elysee and yet not noisy. A very nice boutique hotel. Would recommend it except maybe not in summer.

<Content>Fantastic stay We stayed at this hotel for the Bastille celebrations and we had a great time. We had a superior room, which was spacious and had loads of character; the bathroom was also impressive. The staff were all extremely friendly (the receptionist recommended a nearby restaurant and also managed to secure us a table (no mean feat at 9pm on Bastille Day!). The hotel is well located for touristy things (eiffel tower, champs eleysse etc.) and a 5 min walk from nearest metro (george V), which provides easy access to st germain area (25 mins max). The golden triangle (all the expensive boutiques) is a 5 min walk if you an afford it! I thought the hotel was very good value for money and would recommend it.

<Content>Lovely Hotel This lovely small, quiet boutique hotel is close to everything (Champs d'Elysee, Metro Station, Arc de Triumphe, Eiffel Tower and other areas only a short metro ride away). Also, if you have a car (as we did), you can get in and out of Paris in no time. The hotel room was perfect, we had a double deluxe, with plenty of closet space and just very comfortable overall. Hotel staff were very helpful and couldn't do enough to make our stay memorable. Breakfast was a bit pricey, but you can go to the Pastry shop just a couple of stores down. We shall return on our next trip to Paris.

<Content>Excellent Rating?? My husband and I stayed at the Bassano for about a week in July. We picked this hotel based off the TripAdvisor ratings and I must say I was really dissappointed. This was our last stop on a 2 month European trip and it was the only hotel that didn't live up to its great reviews. There wasn't anything terribly wrong with the hotel but I defineltly wouldn't rate it as the best hotel in Paris.I would say that if you are a frequesnt traveler to Paris and need no assistance from the hotel staff (i.e. restaurant  sightseeing recommendations, tickets etc.) then this hotel is very centrally located and easy walking distance to the underground. Other than that I really wouldn't recommend this hotel for families or first time tourists who need some assistance in planning out a day of sightseeing or restaurant recommendations.

<Content>A slice of heaven The moment we walked in the door to be greeted by a friendly face we knew we could relax. The room was extremely comfortable with character galore. Any assistance in booking, confirming or locating tours was made simple with excellent help and guidance from staff.When coming back exhausted from a day of sightseeing it was relaxing to be greeted by a room ready for a cosy nights sleep. The bathroom was enormous and the bath as big as a single bed. Even the king size towels were fluffy.The location of the hotel was perfect- just a short walk up from George V station and we were there.Only 5mins walk from the Arc and 10 mins from the Eiffel Tower. The L' Open bus tours even had a stop close by...The only draw back to our stay there was the breakfast...not the quality, which was excellent, but that it wasn't included in the price. We resorted to the delicious bakery next door on a few occassions.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone based on friendlness, location and comfort.

<Content>Excellent Service  We decided to stay at the Hotel Bassano because of the reviews on Tripadvisor. We could not fault it, we were upgraded to a superior room which was lovely and spacious particulaly for a Paris hotel. However I took a peek at the standard rooms and they would have been pefectly adequate as well. The decor is lovely and soft and very comfortable. While the hotel is a 2 minute walk to Champs-Elys茅es/Arc de Triomphe it is lovely and quiet. The hotel is wonderfully situated for walking most places and to most of the major attractions. The service was excellent and the staff (all of them without exception) could not do enough to help and assist. We will definitely stay there again and most certainly will be recommending this as the hotel of choice when visiting Paris to our friends, family and colleagues.

<Content>Such friendly people Stayed for husbands birthday in early July having picked this hotel from Tripadvisor reviews and wasn't sure what to expect but staff sooo friendly that it changed my opinion of the french having only dealt with obnoxious students before. They couldn't do enough to help. Especially Ali on the front desk, although all the staff we dealt with were excellent. There were only one or two nit picky things but if you give me a questionaire to fill in I will be brutally honest. I expect perfection in my job and work hard for the money so expect the same from others. My daughter says I'm too tough but thats who I am.This hotel almost made it past my high standards. But will certainly return to Paris and when we do it will be to this hotel.And don't be afraid to e-mail them with questions--they reply unlike many hotels.Thank you to the staff at the Bassano.

<Content>Excellent place! I have been to the hotel with my wife and baby. The hotel offered free upgrade. Staffs were very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and lovely and the location was useful for us as we wanted to stay close by Champs-Elys茅es for a shopping weekend.

<Content>Great First Choice Our first visit to Paris and chose the Bassano because of the review's. We were not disappointed at all. Ok it isn't slap bang in the middle of it all, but with the Champs Elysees on your doorstep and the Metro close by you are only 20 minutes from the rest of the city. Our superior room was clean and very comfortable, especially as you spend most of the time out and about. We decided to breakfast out of the hotel because 18 euro was a bit expensive. Definitely recommendable as a good safe bet and we'd happily return for another stay.

<Content>Great Hotel Charming hotel situated close to the Champ Elysses. The staff were so friendly and helpful.My wife took ill after we checked out due to sunstroke. The hotel were kind enough to allow her to use a room to lie down until she felt better. I would strongly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fine hotel, not so great location I stayed here on a recent weekend between business trips after reading the great reviews on tripadvisor. I was perfectly happy with the hotel: very friendly staff, pleasant ambience, clean, with large and reasonably priced rooms (for Paris, that is). However I am not sure this will be my first choice next time I am in Paris just because of its location. It is in central Paris, but only just--it is on the south side of the western end of the Champs Elysees not far from the Arc de Triomph. That might sound excitingly touristic but actually it is not a very interesting part of the city to me--not the heart of Paris. There is nothing unpleasant about the neighborhood but there are not many restaurants, bars or cafes either (and the three nearest restaurants I saw were Chinese, Spanish,and Russian). if you particularly like the big international stores and nightclubs of the Champs Elysees this would be a good choice because it is only a 5 minute walk to the George V metro stop or 10 to the Place Etoile (which is one of the stops for the Air France bus from CDG). However you are relatively far from the Louvre, Notre Dam, Latin Quarter, etc.

<Content>Nice and Clean, but poor location Of course we chose this hotel because it's ranked #1 on trip advisor. However, I think it's a bit over-hyped and probably over-priced. The room was cute and clean and the staff were helpful - but the hotel is miles away from all the fun stuff in Paris. If you want to spend time with other tourists in expensive cafes on the Champs Elysees - then this hotel is ideal. If you want to be near the Louvre, Notre Dame and the glorious Latin and St. Germain Quaters - then go somewhere else. I don't think it will be difficult to find someplace cheaper. Nevertheless, Hotel Bassano can't help it's location and overall it's a safe bet - and good for a quiet get away far from the bustle of the city.

<Content>Reality Check Required ... This hotel definitely does not deserve its glowing reviews. In fairness, what sets it apart is the standard of service, which is well above average for this type of establishment (courteous; turndown service). Another positive is its reasonably good location (close to Champs Elys茅e, which makes it very accessible by metro to the airport if you have little luggage). I am a regular visitor to Paris and would definitely not stay here again. It is very very overpriced. Our 'superior' room, although quiet and reasonably sized for Paris, was very dark and the furniture and fittings were shabby - not 'shabby chic' I hasten to add, but worn and with nails sticking out etc. Breakfast was good but very overpriced at 鈧?8 per person. You can do better, but if you are stuck it is acceptable.

<Content>Fantastic Staff We stayed at the bassano on 3rd and 4th june. I needed the help of reception staff on several occasions during our stay for reservations, and with a transfer that had gone wrong, they could not have been more helpful. Our room was very clean and comfortable and the location is ideal, just a few minutes walk from the metro station which is on the champs de lysee. I would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Thanks to the staffs Stayed there last May and we were not dissapointed. We had promotional price.Everything was excellent, the room is large and always clean. Large bathroom with bathtub. Free doses of tea and coffe in room, wide screen TV and there was even programes guides in japanese. We loved the buffet breakfasts!. Especially the hotel's staffs were so helpful, they speak perfectly english (better than i do) and give you always the good tips about places to visit or eat. There was a chinese staff who greeted us every morning a good day with a slight bow. If there were some morning journals in japanese, that would had been great.It's really a wonderful place to stay and we will absolutely be back!.

<Content>Wonderful The hotel exceeded all my expectectations. The location is great. A few minutes walk from the Champs Elysses and the George V Metro station. The staff is wonderful. The rooms (I had a standard) is a good size, especially by Paris standards. They change the towels twice a day. Every night they turn down the bed and live a chocolate on the pillow. Definitely keeper.

<Content>C'est fantastic! My husband and I were so impressed with Hotel Bassano and we are definately plan to stay there again. I had been researching for hotels in Paris for months before I finally decided to book the Bassano. I was torn with going with a hotel around the Louvre or around the Arc de Triumphe. We were so happy when we arrived at the hotel. It is in a quiet area, but the Champs Elysee is maybe 3 min away and there were so many little cafe's, great restaurants and high end designer shops nearby. We enjoyed the location very much. Even though we read every review, we were stunned when we walked into our huge room and our huge bathroom. There were huge open shutters from the bedroom and bathroom that over looked the quiet residential street. Everything wonderful everyone has written is true! The hotel is modern, very clean and the staff is very helpful. You will not be disapointed with your stay at the Hotel Bassano because c'est fantastic!

<Content>Well Recommended My wife and I stayed here last week and were very impressd with our standard double room. Very clean and very comfortable. It's true the hotel is only 5 - 10 minutes walk away from the truly vibrant L' Arc de triomphe area. The standard of service is also very high. C'est formidable!

<Content>The little things My short trip to the Hotel Bassano was fabulous. On our arrival we were met with courteous and pleasant staff who provided us with coffee while our room was being prepared, as we were early. Our room was clean and very spacious for Paris. The room was cleaned twice a day and in the evening the room was lit and the towels replaced. The staff provided helpful advice on what to see and how to see it. On our last day we checked out at the prescribed time however our flight home wasnt for another seven hours. We enjoyed our last day in Paris and returned to the Hotel a little early due to the inclement weather. As a result 'Aline' again provided us with some coffee as we awaited our taxi. It is often said that it is the little things that make a hotel visit so enjoyable, the Hotel Bassano have almost got it perfect.

<Content>Great location Just come back from a 3 night stay at the Bassano. The hotel is in the ideal location for visiting the centre of Paris, just a few minutes walk from the Champs Elysses and the George V metro station. Our room was large and very comfortable, and the staff were friendly. Buffet breakfast (not included in the room rate) was reasonable at 12 euros. Although the hotel doesn't have a restaurant there are plenty to choose from nearby - we had a great meal at the Bouef sur la Toit 15 minutes walk away.Highly recommended!

<Content>Wonderful stay We really enjoyed our 3 nights stay at Hotel Bassano and were not disappointed by the great comments you can read about the hotel. The location is excellent, staff very helpful, room very clean and lovely, confortable beds...We decided to extend our stay for one more night. The hotel Bassano was fully booked so they suggested to stay in their sister hotel, Hotel Elysees Regencia, situated 1 mn walking from Hotel Bassano. We had the same rate although the standing of Hotel Elysees Regencia is higher.We were very impressed by the elegant decoration and the quality of the hotel. Hotel Elysees Regencia was renovated last year and it's really worth spending a night there !Moreover we had a good surprise on checking out next morning, seing the same receptionist we had 2 days before at the Bassano. We will not forget these 2 hotels if we have the opportunity to come back to Paris !

<Content>A very enjoyable stay with exceptional and caring staff This is our second time staying at Hotel Bassano and this time we brought our parents. We cannot praise enough the friendliness and indeed helpfulness of the staff. They were without exception excellent. The room and bathroom were scrupulously clean and well stocked with an abundance of fresh towels and bedding.It was great as usual and we all enjoyed our stay. We will be back soon to Paris and we will stay nowhere else!!!

<Content>Outstanding service, great hotel We stayed at the Bassano from 9-13 April for a leisure break in Paris. We'd chosen the Bassano based on recommendations on tripadvisor and due to its location which really is very central. We had requested a courtyard facing room by email, to which they had replied we would need to upgrade, but we had forgotten to do anything about it. When we arrived they'd upgraded us for free and we had a lovely, quiet room on the 4th floor. The room and bathroom were both very clean (I'm one of those people who tries to find fault with hotel rooms and I couldn't with this one!). The service overall at this hotel is outstanding, the receptionists and porters are helpful and charming, the housekeepers are friendly and very thorough, and unlike housekeepers in other hotels actually respect the 'do not disturb' sign even after 11 a.m. We did not try the buffet breakfast but did order the continental room service breakfast which was delivered exactly on time and was fresh and plentiful. On our departure day they looked after our luggage, passports etc for us until we arrived back at the hotel at 6 pm, and as our taxi wasn't due to arrive until 7 pm they even provided us with free pots of tea. Overall, this fantastic hotel more than deserves its four stars for service alone.

<Content>Residence Bassano Exceeded Expectations I and my travel companions stayed at the Residence Bassano for 5 nights in March 2006. After weeks of Paris hotel research on Trip Advisor and other sites, I chose the Bassano because it appeared to offer the best reviews and location for the price. Upon arrival and throughout our stay, we were not disappointed. As other reviews on here have stated, the hotel is in a great location (close to the Champs d'Elysses and Etoile), but on a very quiet, residential street. With the windows closed, we heard no street noise whatsoever. We occupied 2 semi-adjoining rooms during our stay (#52 and #57). Both rooms were immaculately clean, and were serviced twice daily, including fresh towels and chocolates each evening. We had standard rooms, but even these were well furnished and large by Paris hotel standards. The marble covered bathrooms were spacious too, and had great showers with good water pressure. The staff of Residence Bassano were some of the best that I have encountered anywhere in Europe. Forget that rumor about indifferent, uncaring staff at Parisian hotels: if you choose Bassano, you will have the best hotel staff in the city at your disposal. Kudos to Katrine (sorry if I mispelled the name), who worked the day shift at the hotel front desk. She was always extremely pleasant and helpful during our stay. It is a relief to know that henceforth when I travel to Paris, I now have the perfect place to stay. No more Paris hotel research for me ever again; henceforth, home in Paris is the Residence Bassano.

<Content>Superb Gem of a Hotel We stayed at the Bassano from March 11 to March 15 2006 based on Trip Advisor Ratings. We were 2 adults and two children and had one of their suites. It is just like the hotel's web site and pictures describe. We had a wonderful room, the hotel staff were superb and very helpful... my wife wanted to have her hair done.. they arranged for the appointment and walked her over! (a few doors from the hotel). The area is wonderful with 3 bakeries close by, a few small neighborhood restaurants, and a late night grocery (a 8 a huit, for Americans like a 7 Eleven). 5 minutes from the Arch, the Champs, and metro station (George V), and a 10 minute walk to the Tour Eiffel. This was my 2 daughters' first time in Paris and the hotel definitely left a great lasting impression on top of this most beautiful of cities. This is a definite come back to place many times over.

<Content>Perfect for Paris Stayed here for 2 nights as a base for a short visit to Paris in March 2006. The location is great, quiet street in the 16th but only 5 minutes from les Champs Elysees. Room was very clean and spacious by Paris' standards, towels changed twice a day, staff very helpful - perfect. Will stay here next time we visit Paris without doubt.

<Content>A very nice hotel Its very difficult to find a nice hotel in Paris but we would definitely return here and recommend it. Rooms and hotel in general are very nicely appointed and very clean. Great location near many metro stations (and 5 minutes from Champs Elysees).Just one thing: a mirror near a plug sorket for the ladies would be great.

<Content>Great location, great staff, great hotel!!! What a fantastic little hotel!! A 5 min walk from the Champs-Elysee and Arc De Triomphe, 10 mins from the Eiffel Tower. Its perfect for those who dont want to be too far from the action but not right in the middle of it.The staff are pleasant and helpful and it really shows, some of the best I have come across.The hotel is clean, tranquil and contempoarary with simple decoration but also feels homely  comfortable.The breakfast selection is also excellent.It is a small hotel and may not boast the facilities and grandeur of some larger hotels but this does not matter one bit, after all your here to enjoy paris and as such it offers the perfect base from which to do so. I will be recommending this to anyone who visits.
