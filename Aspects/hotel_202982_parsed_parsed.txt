<Content>Good location, nice hotel Great location, very nice rooms, clean. 1 street away from train station, yet this place was very quiet. I highly recommend this place.If I could change anything my wish list would include 2 things. First, free internet. This place does cater to business traveler and business events...so internet should be free. Second, we were in the ajoining building...and in the morning I was awoken to the doors slamming in the corridor. Doors are big and heavy and they really slam when they are closed. I was on vacation, so doing a bit of sleeping in...but that was harder at this hotel.

<Content>Albani Magnifico My wife and I stayed at the Albani for four days and enjoyed every minute. The staff are great as was the room and breakfast. We found an unpretentious tratoria just round the corner (literally) and eat there every evening.We will definitely be going back to this hotel.

<Content>Delightful hotel( if only some of the reception staff were a little less rude) We stayed at the Albani Firenze for 2 days in August. The hotel decor is an absolute delight with old era paintings and furniture. The rooms are also nice ( albeit small). The location of the hotel is great - right next to the railway station and within short walking distance to all the attractions.However some of the reception staff are absolutely atrocious. We booked Pisa tour through the hotel - and paid off in cash. The receptionist just scribbled in some piece of paper and handed us our vouchers. While we were about to check-out, a second receptionist demanded the money again - apparently the esteemed first person had not noted it down in the diary ( yes it appears they operate on diaries and not computers). It might still have been excusable if only the person had later apologized for his mistake - on the contrary he was rude and downright offensive . We had also asked for a late checkout by two hours - same rudeness once more! Hope that the management does something about this so as not to mar an otherwise excellent hotel.

<Content>Albani is fine Choice We stayed at the Albani for a full week in July. We have nothing but positives. Our room was new and spotless with a balcony that we used in the late afternoons for drinks and nibbles. The location was fine although it is a an easy10 minute walk to Duomo area. It is super convenient to to the train and bus treminal for daytrips or intercity train travel. The hotel does cater to large numbers of groups so we found hitting breakfast a little later made for a less busy meal (the tours all race through and out early and often clean out food groups that one must await replacement for). Not a great bar/restaurant but we used our room and balcony before venturing out for dinner.

<Content>Fantastic City Break Destination Just returned from a wonderful 4 days in Florence (Aug 15-18), staying at the Albani. The hotel is one road away from the Santa Maria Novella station (which is one hour from Pisa Centrale - if you fly to Pisa I suggest getting the bus from outside the airport for 10 mins to see the leaning tower before jumping on a train to SMN, Firenze - remember to validate your train ticket in the yellow machines before you get onboard!) so we didn't have far to walk with our cases. There is no noise from the station, and no external noise once in your room (if you stay in the refurbished main building as we did). On arrival the reception staff was friendly (and continued to be throughout our stay - ordering taxis, recommending bars/restaurants etc) and check in was very quick. We were offered a porter but just used the lift as it was only round the corner. Our room was on the second floor and had keys rather than a swipe card (to be left at reception). The room was really spacious, with a HUGE double bed (one mattress, not 2 singles pushed together) and the bathroom was a decent size - not sure about the mirror on the ceiling though! There are dressing gowns and slippers available to pad about the room - particularly lovely when the aircon gets a bit cold! Be warned that the shutters block out all light so you could sleep through most of the day without an alarm!The reception is 24 hours, though the gates are locked after midnight so I did have a minor heart attack at 1am thinking we were locked out all night - you just need to ring the bell!Everything is within walking distance of the hotel - Il Duomo seems to be reachable by any road you take! It is very easy to get around and the hotel provides a map should you need it. Remember to book tickets for the Accademia and Uffizi or you will queue for hours - they are closed on Mondays too. For some of the churches/cathedrals you need to cover up, but they mostly give you what appears to have been a table cloth in a former life if you don't have a shawl.I recommend the roof terrace at the other Summit hotel - Hotel Baglioni (3 mins from Albani) for stunningly romantic views - about 8 pm the sunset and then the moon rose - amazing to watch. For meals, you must try Buca Mario and Golden View Open Bar - the latter has views of the Ponte Vecchio and has totally delicious food.Breakfast (on level -1, 7.30-10.30) is plentiful and there is a great choice. We didn't eat supper at the hotel but judging by the brekkie, it would have been yummy! White jacketed waiters and silver service at breakfast too. All in all a fabulous stay - would definitely go again.

<Content>What an experience The Albani Hotel is amazing!!! From the moment you walk in the door they treat you with the utmost hospitality! The rooms are gorgeous. I stayed in the newer part of the hotel, or the part that has been renovated, and I loved it. Big fluffy bath robes, slippers, the whole 9 yards. The staff was very helpful for trips to museums, churches, and other tours. If you are looking for somewhere to stay in Florence, dont think twice... stay here. It is close to everything and you can walk everywhere. This hotel made my experience in Florence better than I could have expected.

<Content>Exactly what you need in Florence We absolutely loved this hotel. We've been to Venice, Rome and now Florence and this hotel is definitely earning it's stars.Yes we had an orange painted room, but we do not go to landmark places like Florence to stare at the hotel room walls. Nice sized double bed.Safe in the room worked the bathroom well stocked, minibar working, reception staff great answering all questions.If you fancy a nice ice-cream in the evening... exit the hotel, left on to road, left again and walk about 100 metres. Owner is excellent fun and speaks English. He will help you with restaurant recommendations too.We also recommend catching the open top bus 1 street from the hotel (next to the station). Hotel is only 10 minute walk from ALL major attractions.

<Content>Be careful There are two buildings. An older one and a newer one. When making reservation ensure you get the newer building. Location is perfect for walking around. Romm in the old building is nice enough, but not the pictures from the website.Best rates are from company website.

<Content>Very Comfortable Hotel My husband and I came to Florence to visit our daughter, while she was spending her junior year abroad. We had a lovely king room - with an adjoining suite for our daughter! After long days touring, we were extremely comfortable in our quiet, cozy room! The king bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean and loaded with fluffy towels and plush robes! I agree the hotel was dated, not at all shabby and to me that added to its elegant charm. The staff was helpful when requested. The morning breakfast had a variety of offerings including delicious coffee with hot, steamed milk! The close location to the train station was very convenient for us. The physical location is not far from any of the major sights - all within walking distance.

<Content>great I have just spent a week in this hotel on business and I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews but I can honestly say it was one of the friendliest hotels I have stayed in and I have travelled all over the world. All the staff were attentive and the room I had (suite) was great, perhaps a little noisy but it is in a busy city ! If I had a complaint, it would be that they do not use the air con until May, so if you get hot like I did, you will have to open the window but be prepared to be bitten big time by the mosquitoes !

<Content>Excellent Hotel We have just returned from a 4 night stay in the Hotel Albani Florence. We traveled to Florence from Rome and used it as our base for trips to Pisa and Siena, which was great as it was so close the train station. The staff at the hotel were really friendly, the location excellent, the breakfast was very good and the room was great a good size and very clean. Also every evening a notice with tomorrows weather was delivered to the room along with a chocolate which was a nice touch. The gym is apparently in another building which we did not end up looking for so can't comment on what that is like but all in all an excellent hotel which I would thoroughly recommend.

<Content>Charming We loved this boutique hotel. It has a tremendous amount of character and charm. The rooms are a fun mix of bright wall colors, printed fabrics, Persian rugs, yummy wood cabinets and furniture. The beds were very comfortable and the fluffy terry robes and slippers were a delightful treat after a long day of sightseeing. Our triple room included three very comfortable twin beds.The staff was warm, friendly and welcomed us every time we entered the hotel. The lobby was segmented into separate conversation groups, all beautifully decorated with comfortable seating for conversation, reading, planning, checking emails or just plain lounging. The buffet breakfast was better than most in Europe including scrambled eggs, breakfast meats, fruit, yogurt, cheeses, assorted breads and plenty of coffee served by a friendly and accommodating staff.The Albani is close to the train station making it convenient for those traveling by train. It鈥檚 within a few blocks of the Duomo and about 10 blocks from the Accademia. But, it鈥檚 all about the walking in Florence. Even though the hotel is situated close to the train station, it鈥檚 on a very quite street and we never heard any street or train noise. Walls were a little thin and one night we had an extra loud neighbor. Ear plugs are always a must when traveling anywhere!This hotel is a gem!

<Content>Great value! Very close to train station, but a bit of a walk to major Florence sites. Good breakfast buffet, although in another building. Nice housestaff and sitting area. I forgot my cellphone charger in the room and called them afterward, but never got it back. :(

<Content>Good stay, Basic Accomodations I stayed at Hotel Albani only one night so I could make an early train the next morning (the hotel is adjacent to the train station). It was a basic, comfortable room with a good view. Reasonable rates and good service. A little worn down perhaps, but not dirty.

<Content>Family traveler You'll get a better bench and friendlier people in the train station around the corner than service and a comfortable bed in this hotel. The Hotel Albani was the worst of the worst that we found traveling with another family and children throughout Italy. Hotel smelled moldy from rain flooded basement. Had to carry bags up -- and down -- three flights of stairs because the elevator was out and no one -- repeat no one -- from the hotel offered to assist. And the hotel refused to honor advanced payment/reservation for upgraded rooms. Instead, the front desk clerk threatened to call the police if I didn't stop asking about the room rate/reservation. Staff is mean as dirt. Don't count on your food at breakfast at the Hotel Albani. It was all we could do to get a cup of coffee because the breakfast buffet ran out of food so often. Enjoy your vacation -- stay in another hotel where the staff is friendly and the hotel honors its reservation.

<Content>Great Value Our room was clean, quiet, and looked a little worn. I liked the quality moldings, doors, and fixtures. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The free breakfast was outstanding. Even better was the dinner meal we ate in their restaurant. Our kind waiter let us two old ladies SHARE a T-bone steak, salad, French fries, and dessert.

<Content>Horrible Albani Florence We stayed at 4 and 5 stars all through Italy, this place is like a 2 star or worse! We booked a suite, $400+ a night, we didn't sleep all night because you could hear the cars and trucks so well that it was almost like they were driving through the room! We even had our ear plug in, but when the street cleaning vehicles came through the room....that is how it sounded, we took the ear plugs out and had to laugh or we would have cried. We were exhausted the next day because we didn't sleep a wink! Now that is not all (unfortunately)....we brought our laptop so we could get online and send emails and communicate via skype. Their internet service is a router and it didn't work, we had to get online in the lobby....it didn't work and I talked to others with the same problem. While I was trying to get online, the bell man actually asked me to MOVE because I was using a table and there were people in the lobby in chairs near mine that ordered drinks and didn't have a table to put their drinks on.....I was suppose to move my laptop someplace else and give them the table, yet I was paying over $400 a night???? So rude, after the sleepless night and the experience in the lobby, we checked out early the next day. Spend your money some place else....there are plenty of other nice places to stay in Florence, don't waste your time and money!

<Content>Great Hotel The staff were very pleasant and helpful and very welcoming. The Hotel is spotless, we had a fantastic 4 night stay here - very central and within walking distance of all the sights. Breakfast was excellent, buffet style and plenty of it. The Hotel is only a short walk from the station in a side street and in a very quiet location. We would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good quality hotel We were very happy with the Albani. It was a very well cared for hotel in a good location that was quiet. They had convenient valet parking. The lobby and lounge area was lovely. The breakfast was good with a nice selection including eggs and bacon. Our room was clean. The AC worked well. The bathroom was marble. The towels were nice. The shower curtain was way too long and I almost fell out of the shower after slipping on it. The carpet and wall color combination was a bit wild, but not a big deal. I would recommend this hotel for sure.

<Content>Great - worth a visit Our original booking on last minute.com gave us a great price for one standard double room and one superior triple room, yet when we arrived at the hotel they decided to give us two superior rooms so we could be adjacent to each other without unnecessary travel between floors. The rooms were unlike any I鈥檝e stayed in, very grand and quite traditional. The bathrooms were marble and contained a modest supply of toiletries. The room service was great and so were the complimentary slippers. The breakfast was the biggest plus, with a good selection of fruits, cakes and cooked foods. The location is very close to the train station yet on a very quiet road. It is located about 5-10 mins from the Duomo. The benefit of the hotel is that the large rooms and good air conditioning help to keep it cool.Overall, this hotel was a pleasant surprise for the price we paid. As with all things, you get what you pay for, however, in this case we got slightly more. If you are paying full price I doubt you will be as pleased, but none the less still satisfied.

<Content>an excellent choice Booked well in advance and got a good rate for 4 nights in a deluxe room.Room was very spacious and comfortable on the 3rd floor with pleasant decor, good bedding and plush marble bathroom, complete with huge towels and robes.Location was also excellent within an easy walk to the central rail station, but tucked away in a very quiet street. A spacious outdoor courtyard was a delightful place to take your paninis for lunch. We used it in the cool of one evening to enjoy a drink and a chat with fellow guests we had met during our stay.The main touristy area around the Duomo and Uffizi were about a 15 minute walk away, but it was always an interesting stroll and you could stop to visit the markets on the way, or, as my wife did - stop at every bag store to inspect the merchandise.We had no trouble finding good, reasonably priced sidewalk restaurants without wandering too far.Some previous reviews have made comment staff service could be better. We did not find this at all. Our interactions were always polite, friendly and welcoming.We had breakfast in the dining room each morning with very adequate fare and excellent service from the wait staff.For us Florence was the final hotel stay in our 6 week self guided tour of Europe with the last 7 days in an apartment in Rome. Florence was one of our favourite places on our trip and the Albani one of the best hotels. We will be back.

<Content>Clean quiet hotel, helpful staff, very close to train station Enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Albani. The hotel is very close to the train station on a sidestreet, you can easily walk your luggage to the hotel from there and back when you leave by train. The hotel is close walking distance (5-6 blocks) to the Academia to see Michaelangelo's David. The hotel itself is a very nice 4 story property, the rooms are very clean, the bedding very nice, good sheets, blankets, matreses, pillows, etc (not an automatic in Italy). The staff are very freindly, some more helpful and outgoing than others. Other reviews noted Elizabeta and Laura as being nice. Did not see Laura, but did meet Elizabeta twice and she was as indicated very friindly. Most of our transactions, though, took place with Emanuela, we saw her several times during our stay for questions, suggestions and booking tours and she was outstanding, I give her very high marks and thank her for her help. Our room was what we wanted, comfortable, clean and quiet. Our room and bathroom were smaller than the usual room as we asked to switch to a higher floor and accepted his compromise. The morning breakfast was outstanding with very professional staff serving coffee and tea. The only knock on the hotel is the location, you can pretty much walk to everything in Florence, but most of what you want to see is between Duomo and the Arno river, and the Albani is not very close to that, so we found ourselves making several roundtrips back and forth, which was tiring, and as is the case with most train stations, the walk through the train station area to get back to our hotel, especially at night, was not much fun. We enjoyed the hotel very much, would recommend and would stay again, but would also look for something closer to the center of the city to see what else is availale. We stayed in late July and the hotel was not very busy, so if you are going around this time you may be able to find very good rates on Hotels.com, veere or through the hotel's own site.

<Content>Great Hotel I booked this hotel for my 25th Wedding anniversary with my wife and wasn't disappointed. Most hotels in Florence are small and up a back street to some extent. There isn't enough room for large manicured grounds as far as I can see.Reception staff were polite and efficient, room whilst not palatial, was well appointed, air conditioning was virtually silent, safe in room was a nice touch.Breakfast was great - white dinner jacketed waiters, silver cutlery and wide choice of fresh fruit, cereals, corissants, eggs, cakes, yoghurt etc. You won't go hungry!DIdn't eat in restaurant as went out in the evening - but I doubt there would be any concerns there - this hotel is a cut above the rest and we really enjoyed our stay.

<Content>An unexpected pleasure We were forced to stay here from May 26 to May 29 after our pre-arranged accommodation at the Sofitel became non-existent when we went to check in. The Sofitel had decided not to honour our reservation and before we had tried to check in had re-booked us into the Albani and provided us with a taxi to take us there. Anyway that's another issue we have to deal with.Booking us into the Albani, the Sofitel had in some ways done us a big favour. The room we had was quite good, comfortable bed and although our room overlooked the street, the double-glazed windows kept out the noise and ended up being 80 Euros a night cheaper.The breakfast was quite enjoyable and additionally offered some cooked items. The hotel was a little further out than we had originally had intended to be but we really didn't mind the extra walking distance. In the end the hotel turned out to be really convenient for us as we were travelling by train to Venice and the station was just around the corner.The hotel staff were very friendly and obliging and recommended to us to have dinner at the Buca Mario at the Piazza Ottaviani...thoroughly recommend it for for good wholesome meals. If you are a meat eater, try the Florentine steaks...mmmm.As for the 80 Euros a nite that we saved, it ended up paying for a really nice leather jacket for my wife.

<Content>Hotel Albani won our best hotel room Our travel agent recommended this hotel, and it won our best hotel room award for our 15 -day trip to Italy. Located on a quiet side street just 3 blocks from the train station, it is a good bet for those traveling by train. Located in a palazzo built around 1900, this hotel is luxurious from the front door in. The room was beautifully appointed with a large marble bathroom. Our only criticism is that the mattress was extremely firm--like a board, but the pillows were good. The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful. Breakfast buffet was excellent. Hotel is expensive, but not as expensive as other 4 and 5 star hotels in the city.

<Content>Perfect Hotel In Florence We are just back from Florence, where we stayed in hotel Albani for five nights (in: April 27th, out: May 2nd). We had booked two double rooms and one single. Having read the previous reviews, I was a little bit worried about the quietness of the rooms and the rudeness of the stuff but I am pleased to report that our rooms on the second floor were very quiet, and the staff could not be better.This is a wonderful hotel, nearby the train station and very close to the city鈥檚 main attractions. As a previous reviewer has accurately described it, this hotel is 鈥渁n oasis of tranquility鈥?and we were very happy to come back after a day of sightseeing along with the maddening crowds that inundated the city. As far as our rooms are concerned (doubles 220 and 222 and single 223), I must say that although they were the cheapest ones, they were of adequate size and nicely furnished. The doubles were above the hotel鈥檚 entrance and when the windows were closed, the room was really soundproofed. The single was at the back and very quiet too. The marble bathrooms were also nice and comfortable. The staff were very professional and polite especially Elisabeta at the reception, who was very attentive and helped us a lot. Nevertheless, be warned that if you ask the hotel to make your museums鈥?reservations, they will charge you for their service. This is the only thing we did not like about the hotel, as we know that this service is for free in every hotel we have stayed in. The breakfast was very good and plentiful, but I cannot say anything about the restaurant because we did not try it. All in all, we loved the Albani and we would return without any hesitation.

<Content>An oasis of tranquility We booked 2 rooms at the Albani Hotel for 6 nights after much research - a superior twin and a deluxe double - and found both very well appointed, spacious and most importantly very quiet. The King size bed was huge, although the firm mattress took a bit of getting used to. The pillowcases and towels were changed every day and the rooms and bathrooms kept spotlessly clean. The staff were polite and friendly and took the time to talk to my daughter in Italian, as she was attending a language school in Florence. The excellent breakfast comprised - fresh fruit salad, cereals, yoghurts, croissants, pastries, ham, cheese, hot scrambled eggs and bacon with plentiful tea and coffee and other menu options if required. The restaurant, as the other public rooms was lavishly decorated and comfortable - once or twice there was a queue for a table at breakfast but this was never a real problem. We ate in just once and were somewhat disappointed compared with the food enjoyed at many of the local restaurants. Having said that - we really enjoyed our stay at the Albani and would have no hesitation to return - it is very convenient to the station and the historic centre, yet offers an oasis of tranquility amidst all the city bustle.

<Content>excellent hotel This is a great hotel, in a great location. Literally 1 block from the Florence train station. Easy access for walking to Duomo and other areas. About 2-3 blocks from the market.Rooms was wonderful, very comfortable  clean. Hotel staff couldn't have been better  nicer. They also provided great recommendations for dining. Breakfast each morning was very good  plenty of choices. The outside courtyard/patio was very nice for lunch and drinks in the afternoon.Would highly recommend.

<Content>A good experience We had a fine experience at the Albani.You read all the time in these reviews that rooms are small, but it's Europe. I thought that, for Europe, our room was actually pretty big. It was well decorated, with the usual amenities, and we did not experience noise from other rooms, as some other reviewers have mentioned. The air-conditioning, which one often finds is sort of anemic in Italy, was robust, too.We also found the staff friendly and helpful, unlike other reviewers, including the valet service. We had our breakfasts in our room and didn't eat other meals in the hotel.The location is good -- slightly away from the historic center, but within easy walking distance.

<Content>Fantastic hotel right in the centre of Florence couldnt fault the Albani Florence Hotel. Staff couldnt have been more helpful. Perfect for sightseeing, within walking distance of everything. Comfortable rooms with nice little touches such as weather forcasts sweets slippers. Would definitely stay here again and would reccommend highly to everyone.

<Content>NICE HOTEL, HORRIBLE STAFF I am so very disapointed by this hotel. It is a very nice hotel in a pretty good location, but the horrible experience w/ the staff I encountered totally ruined my vacation.My wife and I checked in for 2 nites on a Sunday. Upon arrival, I advised the staff that we wanted to take a tour to Pisa and also see the museums( Statue of David , etc...)The staff negelcted to tell me that the museums are closed on Monday. They set us up for a tour to Pisa on Sunday, when it should have been vice verca. I went all the way over to Europe, and was not able to see the most important historical monument of Florence due to the ineptness of the staff.On our 2nd day, I left clothes to be pressed in our room, per the instructions of the front desk. The maid hatd come in and cleaned the room and placed the bag of clothes on a side chair.I was told the clothes would be returned by 3p, then 4p then 5p.At that time, my wife noticed that the clothes were still in the room. I called down to the front desk and asked them what was being delivered to my room since the clothes were never taken in the 1st place. Due to another error, I was confined to my room for another 3 prescious hours while I could have been out sight seeing. The worst part of all was the staff not caring or offering a simple apology .The only possitive thing about the staff was the breakfast room staff. They were nice and helpfull.I am a travel agent. After what I have experienced, I will never, ever send anyone to this hotel. What is the most disapointing was that this hotel belongs to a very reputable, high end hotel chain. I now have 2nd thoughts about using this chain in the future, for any location, not just Florence.

<Content>Rude staff at the Albani in Florence We stayed at the Albani Hotel in Florence two nights on our trip to Italy. The hotel was recommended by our cycling tour so we assumed we would recieve good if not great service. The rooms were very nice but the staff was so arrogant and rude it was hard to believe they can get away with that. This was our only instance of this during 2 weeks of travel throughout Italy staying in 4 and 5 star hotels the entire trip. Our friends wanted to leave us a message and were told we were not staying at the hotel. They had left us an earlier note so this was ridiculous. When I asked the front desk about this they said that we should have left our key behind the desk. My husband was in the internet lounge and I was in the shower so he had the key! They also blamed us for not honoring a dinner reservation they had made but when we checked in and asked about our reservations we were only told about one so we assumed the other wasn't possible. They were very acccusatory. They also told us we could leave luggage with them (we were coming back to stay another night 4 days later) and when we returned my husband was told to sit in the lobby that a manager needed to confirm (we had already called ahead and told this wouldn't be a problem) and my husband didn't have time for this because we had a train to catch. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone, there are many nice hotels in Florence without the arrogant and condescending attitude.

<Content>Nice hotel, location.....paper thin walls..... We stayed at this hotel as a part of a tour booked with Globus. The hotel offers a good location with short walks to good restaurants and shopping. Overall the experience was postive with the hotel staff offering polite service. The only draw back that I would caution other travellers is that the walls were paper thin. We could easily hear other occupants carrying on regular conversations with no apparent attempt to be loud or inconsiderate.

<Content>Great hotel! Good location Stayed there from Jun 5 through Jun 8 after reading reviews on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed. The hotel is 3-4minutes walking distance from the main train station and because Florence is so small, its also 5-10mins walking distance away from the center, shopping and restaurants. So its great - you pay less since the hotel is techincally not 'in the center' and if you come by train, no need to get a taxi. The hotel itself is very well maintained with a private driveway, and two separate restaurants. The free breakfast in the morning is also a great addition. The rooms are small (or normal, in European definitions), but are very well decorated, clean and comfortable. The bathroom is great, white marble from floor to ceiling. Amenities are god tooIf the room was double the size, it would probably easily for for 450 euros a night.

<Content>Nice hotel with one exception I stayed with my mother and 7 mo. old infant at the Hotel Albani in late April. The hotel is beautiful with a large lobby, fully multi-lingual staff, and fair restaurant. It is right by the train station and walkable to all sites in the city. We stayed in room 124 (I think) that was very large with a king size bed and full size pull out sleeper sofa. They also placed a crib in our room free of charge. The only problem with this hotel is that the mattress was extremely hard. So hard, it feels like camping. If you stay in this hotel, I would request to see the room and try out the mattress before accepting your room assignment. This hotel is wonderful in all other ways, but given the hard mattress I would not stay there again.

<Content>Beautiful decor - great location The best thing about this hotel is it's location. A few minutes walk and you are slap bang in the middle of Florence. We used the Duomo as our point of reference so we never got lost.The hotel itself is very clean. The decor is beautiful and very much what you would expect from Italy. Vibrant colours and lots of mirrors. We loved it.The room was bigger then expected but two things let it down. For us the bed was like sleeping on the floor it was that hard, but then we did so much walking during the day we would have slept on a bed of nails. The other disappointing thing, which has already been mentioned, is the noise. The walls must be made of paper as we could hear everything from the next room. The noise woke us every morning but the plus side to that was we never needed an alarm clock.We had breakfast one morning (which was included in the price) and we thought it was fine - it's what you would expect for a continental breakfast.This was a Christmas present from my husband and what a great present it was. If you intend to do a lot of site seeing but still want a bit of comfort then this hotel is for you.

<Content>Great hotel, little room! The hotel itself is really nice, great location and very quiet for a city hotel; also on the plus side the bed was comfortable and the furniture and decor of the public areas were in keeping with the hotel.Quite luxurious.Maybe I didn't have one of the better rooms! It was smaller than we thought such a great hotel can have! We found a great rate on the internet for fairly decent price including breakfast: maybe such a room is reserved for the lower rate (the one we had...)on the web!I would recommend this hotel for its location, cleanliness and good service, however....if you get a bigger room!

<Content>Nice Hotel, Okay Stay Based on the recommendations of TripAdvisor, we booked this hotel mainly because it is close to the train station (7 minute walk). However, if you are trying to look for this hotel in the dark, it can be tricky.The staff were friendly and helpful at the hotel. The lobby area is eloquent and the room as well. The room was quite large as well as the washroom. However, we were disappointed by the lack of toiletries available for a 4-star hotel.Even though the room was nice, we didn't sleep too well during our 3-night stay there as we felt that there was uneasiness in the room - it could have been us but we did not sleep well in this hotel. As well, the soundproofing was okay so we awoke to people coming and going in the mornings.The breakfast was disappointing as the selection of food available was limited. This was the only hotel that didn't offer cheese at breakfast. We have stayed at many hotels and the major drawback with this hotel was that it seemed like it didn't offer alot in terms of extras.However, the hotel was located in a convenient location and during the days we were able to walk back to our hotel for a break and to take catnaps. Pretty much all of Florence is walkable and if you are looking for location, this hotel would be ideal.We enjoyed Florence but will probably look for a hotel that we feel more comfortable in the next time around.

<Content>Loved it! This is a beautiful hotel located on a quiet street that is very close to the train station (a 5 minute walk). The area in which the hotel is located is convenient, with lots of restaurants and shops in the surrounding area. In general, I found that Florence was small enough that most things were within walking distance, and certainly from this hotel.This was the nicest hotel we stayed in during our travels in Europe. The bathrooms were modern and fancy, and the bedroom decor was equally nice. We were extremely pleased. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great place to stay in central Florence The Albani is a really good place to stay. Location is perfect and also facilitates easy access to other Italian cities such as Pisa . We stayed for 3 nights in September and found the service excellent, as was the room - unique and exceptionally clean. Unfortunately two nights sleep were ruined by two very inconsiderate/noisy guests on the floor above. This problem was resolved by the Manager (good people person/understanding) and third night stay was excellent and showed the hotel in a true light. Dinner in the restuarant (complimenary) was very good. Despite the problem mentioned we would stay here again and not hesitate to recommend it to anyone. Breakfast was also good and wholesome.
