<Content>A quirky, comfortable place I stayed 2 nights at the Belmont on recommendation from our Dallas-based employee. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the nearby restaurant has excellent food at a reasonable price. This is a 40's era hotel that was renovated and has some quirks. My room was reasonably quiet but I could imagine if the hotel was full this could be a noisy place. The room was immaculate though a bit sparse. The bathroom is small (due to the era) with a tiny shelf for all my toiletries - careful, its directly over the toilet! Give the Belmont a try if you're tired of the cookie-cutter hotels and enjoy the personal, unique touch it offers.

<Content>hip and fun hotel - we're anxious to return! What a refreshing blast from the past. My husband and I stayed at the Belmont during the Texas/Oklahoma game weekend, on October 11th. The hotel was booked to capacity (note to self: book early for next year's game). This was our first stay at the Belmont, and we loved the hotel. Because of events related to the State Fair and the football game (Texas Longhorns now ranked #1!), we didn't spend a lot of time at the hotel, but we did walk the grounds and ate at the Cliff Restaurant next door.In short, we had a wonderful experience. Despite the hotel being fully booked, or perhaps because they had planned for it, the staff was available and responsive, and we felt well attended, from the valet staff, to the staff members who drove the shuttle that took us to the bus station to catch a bus to the Fair, to the front desk and housekeeping staff. Mandy was especially considerate and helpful. Nice to see someone who keeps their cool on a what was almost certainly a demanding weekend, and seems to actually enjoy her job.Our room was basic, a room outside the main building in the old motor court area. The room was fresh and clean, and quiet (as we had requested). The bathroom was older with updates and sparkling clean, with large fluffy towels. We added the romance package to our stay, which included a nice French Brut champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries. The menu at the Cliff Restaurant was varied (light eating to full dinners), and our dinners and desserts were delicious, with super-attentive and friendly waitstaff. Room service is available from the Cliff. Valet parking is (or was, on this weekend anyway) $15.00 per night, and not free as we had expected, although the in-and-out was free. We used the valet since the parking was more secure, although there is a self-park lot next door to the Cliff Restaurant.We're already talking about returning to this charming restored hotel. If you like a hip, retro hotel (with a few key modern conveniences), and with staff that actually seem to enjoy working there, check out the Belmont. We predict you'll arrive and leave with a smile on your face. We did.

<Content>Terrific staff, cool hotel First and foremost, we almost didn't book the Belmont based on some of the reviews about the neighborhood it is in... Give me a break! I've seen scary neighborhoods and this is NOT one. Besides, the hotel is secluded.Upon arrival, the valet knew who we were and which room we'd be in.. He was great. Front desk was great. Room (we stayed in a suite which, I think, was more or less a double regular room) was great. Bartender was great. Restaurant was great.(Note: There were a couple downsides... The wonderful view of downtown we had hoped for from our window was blocked by a tree and the complementary high-speed internet wasn't working)... It's a pretty cool spot - a completely redone motor court... Here's a tip: Don't waste your time driving downtown to eat - eat at their restaurant... We drove around on a Sunday night looking for something to eat and finally just came back and ate there - it was fabulous. We had breakfast there the following day as well...If you're borderline...or pondering staying somewhere downtown instead..stop it. Stay here instead - I'm glad we did.

<Content>Very Interesting and Fun My wife stays at the Belmont often when she is in Dallas. She has a much more free spirit then me, so I wanted to check it out. I found the hotel to be a lot of fun. The pool and bar are fantastic. It is great for people watching. Everyone was friendly. The restaurant was great. Rooms were ok. Bathroom needed updating and was small. If you are open minded and like to have fun I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Not My Cup of Tea I made reservations for a deluxe room at a rate of $120 per night. I found our room to be small and claustrophic. The one chair and two tables in the room were plastic patio type furniture, not the least comfortable for sitting and talking or watching television. In addition to the room, there was a screened porch next door. The porch was not connected to the room by a door, you had to exit the room and walk around to the porch which I found very odd. The porch consisted of one small window, a concrete floor, one chair and an ashtray. Certainly not somewhere I would want to spend any time. My husband was definitely not impressed and asked that we leave. Some people obviously love this place because there are many good reviews. Just not for us. We left and went to the Hyatt for about $25 less.

<Content>Funky  My wife and I stayed at the Belmont last weekend and found it to be a really hip and cool boutique hotel with a feel very unique to Dallas. We've experienced a lot of pretentious people in Dallas, but not at the Belmont. And who knew North Oak Cliff was so great? We spent some time driving around the Kessler Park area and walking around the Bishop Arts District... definitely cool places.The hotel was clean and well decorated (minimally on the inside, with art and scultures outside). It is fun to just walk around the grounds and look toward downtown Dallas. The landscaping is done really well there. Also, the pool is heated and located overlooking the city with a little grassy area to hang out. We also liked the bar and the outdoor patio. They bartender opened an hour early to serve my wife and I Saturday afternoon drinks. Also definitely try the Cliff restaurant next door. It was packed for brunch on Sunday so probably best to call ahead. The food was really good and we enjoyed the atmosphere.Our only complaint was that we booked a standard room because that was all that was available (although a great deal at $109). It was in the hallway right next to the lounge and was pretty loud late at night and early in the morning. While the rooms have been renovated and cleaned well, it looked like they should have taken more time regrouting the bathroom tile to make it look a little cleaner. We will definitely be staying at the Belmont again but will not book a standard room. Most of the other rooms are not attached to the main lobby, so we will try them next.

<Content>great place to stay we liked the idea of the hotel, a converted motor court, and so decided to stay in a bungalow room(these could be a bit noisy depending on your neighbors we had no trouble) - the location turned out to be great for us, tourists visiting Dallas, it was not far from downtown, the freeways or the artist community  the neighborhood was interesting - the hotel property was great looking, the room clean  comfortable with good design  a city view as we requested - the staff was great especially Jason at the desk  Lena the manger - there was a mix up with housekeeping making up our room  the attentiveness to correct this  make sure we were comfortable could not have been better - all in all we had a great stay here - gerardNYC

<Content>Loved the Hipster Belmont Hotel Although i do live in the same city as this hotel I decided to celebrate my birthday there! I am glad i did. This hotel is on top of a hill in an underdeveloped area with great potential.If you are used to brand new, squeaky clean, plush hotels, i'd read below before i make a decision to stay a whole weekend:First off, valet, it's free! Even for guests. You will check in and since some of the rooms are located in different areas the Valet will drop you off with their golf cart. The hotel is atop of a hill and spread out. It is sort of like it's own little village so there are no hallways!Belmont took this old 40's building and rennovated it but left its charachter in place. It has some of the original fixtures, tile, and concrete walls. Props to the owner for leaving it that way but modernizing it with the decor and furniture. I rented the loft suite! I cannot say that i've been anywhere that had a view like this. You could practically touch the Dallas skyline with your fingertips. It's gorgeous!It had 2 floors, downstairs was not large at all only to fit a day bed and wall length desk, flat screen, countertop with sink and a bathroom with a stand up shower. Upstairs was much larger, queen size bed, daybed, wall mounted flat screen and bathroom with standup shower.i read that someone thought it was in a sketchy area, not true. Why would you even walk off the grounds, it has everything you need!The hotel was very accomodating about having guests over. It has the BarBelmont which had flawless service, and a skyline view as well! Like i said i stayed in the loft so i'm not sure if everyone will have a view like ours so ask to be placed in a suite that will. Few more tips:infinity pool, ice machines scattered among the property, landscape was pretty, 5-10 minutes from downtown, 15 min from greenville ($18-20 cab ride one way). CliffCafe for food service. would i stay again? Already thinking about it.

<Content>Unique Hotel, Good Value! I've stayed at the Belmont several times in the last year and have had a great experience every time. The atmosphere is fun, funky and fabulous. The staff is friendly and laid back and the rooms are cute with both original and modern elements (original tile, new flat screen TV) put together. Great view of downtown skyline from bar patio and pool area. The Cliff Cafe, their onsite dining spot, has delicious pulled pork quesadillas and a good wine selection. You can get breakfast all day too if you want. The Bar Belmont is a cool place at night for a drink or snack. The area is surrounding the hotel is not great, but I felt safe walking around every time. It will get better with time. They have security that patrols at night. Another bonus: they offer quick complimentary shuttle to the Bishop Arts District or Downtown for more dining and shopping options.

<Content>Disappointing We stayed there for Valentine's Day and it was fine as long as you did not have to deal with the staff. They are not good when they get busy.The Valet did not have us on the list and gave us a hard time when parking. No one carried our bags and we definitely did not get a bucket of ice like another reviewer did. The bar was busy with one server. She started out ok but then disappeared. When we asked for another drink, she finally did bring it; slamming it on the table. We said something to bartender inside which got us the response from the server of I am not ignoring you, I am just busy. We sent an email to the hotel and at first the representative seemed helpful--wanting to talk by phone. However, she did not seem to believe us and then said she would get back to us. She did after I emailed her 3 more times. Her email basically told us too bad that we were disappointed. We live in Dallas and I bring in business clients often. I was hoping that the Belmont would be a good addition to my list. It is not. And we will not be going back to stay or even for drinks.

<Content>Fun, hip Belmont My husband and I live in North Oak Cliff not far from the Belmont and decided to spend a night for a romantic night out. Our standard garden room was clean, comfortable and minimalist, with a great view of the Dallas skyline. We enjoyed sitting in the vintage chairs in our room's screened porch, which is a little dark but a great creative reuse of the old parking spots. The bathroom was small but clean and the Kiehl's products are a nice touch. We sleep with earplugs, so I can't comment as to whether noise is an issue, but I wouldn't think so. I also think the Belmont's landscaping is beautiful--lots of roses and water-thrifty native plants.Our package included drinks and appetizers at the Bar Belmont, which has a terrific patio and good music. We come here with friends sometimes when we aren't staying here--don't make it a priority for the inside, but in warm weather the patio is tops and has a relaxed, hip crowd. We also received a bottle of champagne which we took down to the heated salt water pool. There were only a couple of other folks around by the pool, so we drank our champagne, floated around, and looked out over the skyline. Noplace else in Dallas do you get this view, especially from the pool. Check it out also when they host B-Movie night at the Belmont in the summers and you can watch a movie, drive-in-style, projected on the building while you sit, drink, and swim or hang out on the lawn. The Cliff Cafe opened in the late summer/fall after our stay but we've eaten there since. The macaroni and cheese and the calamari were hits, while the steak was a miss. Lots of better steak options in Dallas. The Bar Belmont food is decent--I liked the brie and apple quesadilla.There is construction near the Belmont (new townhomes going in) so that may cause noise to be a problem. Also, don't plan on walking anyplace from the hotel--Fort Worth Avenue is improving but still not walkable. Drive or cab to Bishop Arts in Oak Cliff and walk there.When we have relatives/out of town guests come to visit I recommend Belmont.

<Content>Adventures in Gansta-Land My friend came to Dallas for work and I told her about this place which I had read about. She got a reservation and we decided to meet for dinner at the hotel on her second night.I was waiting out front of the hotel restaurant (overlooking a Dollar General Store) watching for my friend to walk down the hill from the hotel and there was this group of crazy looking gangster types walking down Ft Worth Ave (very bad area) they were just hanging around, drinking out of paper bags. They were scary and I just froze as they approached. I was not sure whether to run or scream but I just stepped backward towards the door. One of the guys rushed towards me and got about 10 feet from me so fast. He thought it was hilarious. Tattoos on the face and neck and visibly wasted. He walked away and threw down his paper bag/bottle. I managed to duck into the restaurant, which was really pretty. But I was still worried about my friend because these people were just walking around out there and hollering at the other 鈥榞anstas鈥?driving down the street. She made it safely. Dinner was ok but service was painfully slow and they were out of the entr茅e I ordered. I only found out they ran out after waiting for my meal. They were a little unorganized in general. Waitstaff was nice.So I went back up the hill with her to see her room. Cute bungalow that was correctly represented on the website.The only problem is that it backs up to some big construction site and they start working early each morning.Later I walked back down to the parking lot and hurried into my car. My heart was pounding. It is just a dangerous area. It did not help that on my way out I commented to an employee and they just chuckled and said that the area IS bad and they see a lot of crazy stuff.The parking lot is mostly dirt and concrete chunks. It all seems so out of place.I got out of the parking lot and headed towards the highway and what the鈥?a freakin鈥?sheriff is behind me with his lights on. I was worried but I had done nothing.He ID鈥檇 me and was friendly enough. We chatted for a few minutes and he said that they check a lot of people in the area because of 鈥榩roblems鈥? He thought I was someone who possibly just stole a car.OK. Well I got the heck out there!Bottom line, I think the place is kind of cute but I just don鈥檛 know if it is worth risking my life to go there at this time. It looks like it will be gentrified in a year or two. Loads of construction and lots of space for sale. Maybe I will check it out again in 2010.Until then I will recommend that out of town friends stay in the uptown area.

<Content>Unique, exceptional service - a gem! I haven't been here but an hour or two and I've already found my new home away from home in Dallas.Bear with me, this will be a long review, but I think the beauty of the Belmont is truly in the details...I'm in a Garden Standard Room ... #38 to be exact ... a corner unit with 3 windows (on 3 sides of my room!!) and a gorgeous view of the Dallas skyline. It looks like a small apartment - I even have a chair out on the front porch of my unit.The room is adequately sized and a touch minimalist with the decor - very comfortable, and decently appointed.Just finished a delicious dinner at The Cliff Cafe, the onsite restaurant. I'm now enjoying their signature Belmontini in the lounge and using the free internet access.The staff is ridiculously friendly. From the valets (complimentary parking with your stay and they carry your luggage to your room and bring you a bucket of ice) to the desk staff to the waiter at the restaurant to the bartender - it's evident that the staff here are genuinely pleasant, and very concerned about providing a positive experience for guests.Don't let reviews about the neighborhood bother you. There's not much around - yep, it's transitional, and in a few years this place will be surrounded by condos and a Starbucks. Matter of fact, the guy who owns the hotel owns more land around here and is working very diligently to bring the neighborhood up. (Search for an article in the Dallas Morning News from about a year ago if you don't believe it.) In the meantime, enjoy a bit of an oasis!Do not stay here if you are looking for the standard, same-furniture-as-the-hotel-I-stay-at-in-every-city-I-visit. If you want a big chain hotel, for heaven's sake, stay in one - you'll get exactly what you've come to expect.If you want a historic, quirky property that preserves the original 1940's motor court architecture updated to modern, comfortable, affordable standards, by all means, contact the Belmont.If you want to stay someplace where you find a handwritten welcome note waiting on your bed on arrival, beautifully landscaped grounds, and the friendliest staff in Dallas, just visit their website and book a room.I think next time I'm here I'll try one of the 2 story lofts.....they look fun...

<Content>Fast Times at Belmont High I don't know where to begin. The staff: Every employee my travel companion and I encountered greeted us with a warm smile and immediately inquired how they could be of service. The hotel: Beautiful! Rooms have a feng shui decor. Our room was spacious and we had a screened porch with a view of the immaculate landscaped grounds and a skyline view of downtown. Plantings were in shades of sage and lavender with spots of pink and red roses. The bar: Relax with a glass of wine and enjoy the glowing Dallas skyline. The restaurant: Had a filling breakfast. Had I been in town longer I would have enjoyed a lunch or dinner there. I would have to put this hotel in the couples/adult only category. Hip but not haughty. The staff is young and attractive. You will need a car or taxi (the hotel does offer limited transporation) to get to Dallas proper, approximately 2.5 miles from the hotel. There is also a heated pool that I enjoyed lounging around but didn't take the plunge.

<Content>Ick Don't even waste your time! I booked a stay at this hotel just based on the website. I was in Dallas for a convention with one of my co-workers and was under the impression that our room would have 2 beds. Not a strange request so I thought...When we arrive to the room there was only 1 double bed. When I brought this to the manager's attention, she told me that there was only one room (out of the 67) that had two beds. So we opted to change hotels. The manager , a woman named Brandy, insisted on charging us for that night even though we weren't comfortable with the condition of the room. (Mold in bathroom, misleading on internet pictures.) She was argumentative, rude , unprofessional and very condescending. We finally left and waited outside in the cold for 45 min for a taxi Brandy called for us. We finally arrived at our new hotel at 1:30am tired and distraut. We stayed at the Indigo Hotel which was amazing and less expensive than the overpriced and underkept Belmont hotel. Moral of the story...never stay at this hotel.

<Content>A college dorm is trendier than The Belmont This place is hip if you're not in the know....The suite that I stayed in during a holiday party was littered with budget decor  bad lighting. While the view was nice, it did not make up for the lack of luxury.This hotel is cute, but not hip. I've heard it compared to Hotel San Jose, Austin, TX, but it's far from it... Hotel San Jose is truly unique with custom details, not off-the-shelf flair.Plus (or minus as it may seem) it's located in a rough area... or up and coming as some may speculate.

<Content>What a great find! We had a great time at the Belmont. The hotel is beautiful, unique, and clean. The staff was attentive and helpful, comparable to my recent stay at the Ritz. This hotel is a great value too. For $80 per night I had a nice-sized room (complete with ironing board, hair dryer, coffee pot, great toiletries, good water pressure), valet parking, concierge services from the front desk, access to a computer and printer, continental breakfast, and a car and driver (local shuttle service). In the evening the highly acclaimed Bar Belmont comes to life with interesting guests relaxing on a deck that overlooks downtown Dallas. We found it to be a great venue for socializing with other guests. I also loved the healthy choices offered in the complimentary breakfast--yogurt, fresh granola (the best I have ever tasted), and fruit. They also had an assortment of pastries and other items. Enjoying breakfast outside on the deck was a great way to start the day. The unique decor and impeccable service make this one of the best boutique hotels I have ever visited. I will definitely stay at the Belmont again...and again. What a cool little gem I have discovered!

<Content>WORST HOTEL!! good bar.. Came in late and was greeted by what I assumed to be a drunkered...Later come to find out it was one of the owners. There was no place to put my clothes away, food is overpriced and terrible (the poor bartender had to keep making excuses for everything) and the only person who tried anything nice was that bartender Jose, who really seems to be the only one who knows what he is doing...Really the bar is great and the rooms are nice. Whoever designed those two aspects of a hotel were obviously the only ones thinking, btw, Belmontini is awesome, but overpriced.....Come, but don't stay

<Content>Belmont not for children!!!!!!!! I would not recommend the Belmont if you have children, especially babies. The way some of these old rooms are configured you share an inside door--you know the kind you can open up between each room. Anyway, our baby cried out in the middle of the night for approximately 30 seconds because of a lost pacifier and apparently this upset the next door guests and they proceeded to bang on the shared door really really loud, which in turn aggrivated our baby even more. Not to mention, instead of cribs you get pack n' plays, which wouldn't be so bad but the hotel didn't even bother to put sheets or blankets in the pack n' plays, so we had to call the front desk and have them bring us some....in my opinion, just not a good choice if you have a baby. Also, the traffic noise is very loud outside the window.

<Content>perfect for romantic getaway This is such a cool hotel, very noirish, rat pack, 50's, space-age swingin' batchelor pad kind of vibe, with funky and artsy overtones. Very romantic if you're thinking of that kind of getaway with your loved one... great views of the city. I guess it's a little off the beaten path, but if you have a car you'll be all set. Check out the Bishop Arts district which isn't too far away.

<Content>Great Hotel - Use caution w/ Valet Service The staff and accomodations are fantastic. The rooms are very unique. The lounge and bar was awesome. The staff, during my stay, were great.However, I did experience some severe problems w/ the valet. I have a german car. On my key ring, I have a fob w/ attached key that has been deactivated as I thought I had lost it. I found it recently, and I had planned to take the car in to get the key reprogrammed the very next working day. I totally forgot to tell the valet guy about which key he should use to start it. Well, he used the wrong key. Instead of calling me when the car would start and then turn itself off (they screen said Immobilization Activated), the valet guy continued to try to start my car w/ the incorrect key. I had my car towed to the dealership to deactivate the immobilization feature. PROBLEM: Because the valet guy tried to start it sooooooooo many times (30+ times), $1,000 in damage was caused. While I do not hold them 100% responsible for the damages (I should have had the foresight to instruct them on which key to use). Anyway... they are refusing to accept responsibility. All I asked is that they accepted 50% of the cost of the valet guys error. He should have called me immediately when there was a problem.I loved the hotel, but I am a bit put off in regard to how they are handling this issue. I had planned to make this hotel my new spot. Needless to say, I will never stay there again.

<Content>Great place off the beaten path. This is a great chic, boutique hotel. The rooms are simple and modern. They have flat screen tvs which are small but much better than the average hotel. The deluxe bungalow had a city view. Get a room with a city view. It's definitely worth the extra money.BarBelmont is cozy and has a great relaxed atmosphere. Many locals from Oak Cliff patronize this place and I can see why. Drinks are a little about average price, $11 for bourbon and $11 for a martini but the atmosphere is worth paying for. The pool is really cool. It was a little too cool to swim but was a great place to hang out.This is a great little boutique hotel. Please consider this place. It's close to downtown and to some really good restaurants. Be sure to rent a car because you will need to drive to sites around the city. Definitely a great place to celebrate an anniversary! It's not a 5 star hotel like the W or The Mansion but very relaxed and a great place. I can go on. We plan on returning once the restaurant is open which is scheduled for Feb. 2007.

<Content>Fun, hip, funky, cool...! I travel 75 nights a year, and have never bothered to write a review before.The Belmont is a blast. It is a 1940's motor lodge in a dicey neighborhood outside of downtown Dallas, sitting on a hill overlooking downtown. The new owners have converted it into a very hip, happening hotel and bar. We decided it was our peaceful little oasis, but didn't venture off the property.If you're looking for the Ritz, this isn't your place. But if you want a fun and different hotel, and are a little adventurous, you'll love the Belmont. I did.My room was a loft (2 story unit) with a view of downtown Dallas. The view from my second floor bedroom was incredible. The view from the pool is nothing short of spectacular.The rooms aren't fancy - they were built in the 1940s. While the rooms have been upgraded with some art deco items and really nice flat-panel TVs, they are fairly plain. The bed was new and comfortable. That said, the view of the downtown skyline made my room better than a suite at the Westin.The bar is fantastic. Very hip. Lots of young, beautiful people walking around. They have an outdoor patio that overlooks downtown. We drank cocktails and ate bar food (very good) outside - it was wonderful. Conde Nast apparently rated Bar Belmont one of the best new bars in the world at some point. It really is nice.Net, net - if you're looking for something fun and different in Dallas, you'll like the Belmont a lot.If you want a fancy, typical upscale hotel, go to the Westin.

<Content>Just o.k. This hotel is isolated, but it was good for where I had to go. I was kind of excited after reading these reviews and seeing some of the pictures on the hotel's web site. Unfortunately, I didn't get the room I saw in the pictures. The only unusual things in my room were art deco light fixtures and a picture of the backsides of cows. My bathtub wasn't round. In fact, it was quite old. The shower was good, though. The room was very ordinary with very thin walls. Continental breakfast was o.k., but no restaurant on site. Customer service was excellent.

<Content>Definately unique but isolated We recently stayed at The Hotel Belmont - going by other reviews and forum advice, I was expecting a great deal more than what it actually was.However I would still highly recommend it. It has been restored beautifully, the rooms are basic but stylish. The bar area and outside terrace looking back into the city is worth the stay - at night the view is stunning. It's definately a nice change from a chain hotel.Just be aware it is in a very isolated area, there is nothing in the area as far as restaurants or food, shopping, or anything at all to do - you need a car. The hotel does serve food from 5pm but any other time you'll have to drive somewhere. If you want to go out in the evening to a restaurant, bars then be aware you'll need to taxi.if you want something a little different it's a great choice.

<Content>Escape the glass high-rise hotels I stayed in the Belmont while attending a conference at the Convention Center. The Belmont was a great escape from the usual high-rise glass hotels. The architecture was beautiful, and the renovation was tasteful. The service was the best I've experienced, including the complimentary shuttle service to downtown. Evenings at the hotel were a delight on the patio with a view of the Dallas skyline. The Belmont is a real find.

<Content>Fantastic Design, Fantastic Service The room was immaculate, and beautifully appointed. The service was fantastic, and staff went out of their way to accomodate special requests, like a dry place to park my motorcycle when the weather was bad. They even offered to go buy me lunch at a restaurant when the kitchen was closed but I was awaiting my airport shuttle. I have stayed, through the grace of relatives, at some of the nicest hotels on earth, such as The Oriental in Bangkok, and the service here is definitely on par with 5-star places. If you're at all interested in modern design, the lobby, bar, rooms, and restaurant will be aesthetically satifying. I feel a little like I'm gushing, but I've never felt inspired to write a review of a hotel before, if that's any indication of what a beautiful and hospitable place I found this to be. Highly recommended.
