<Content>Acceptable hotel but pricey This is a pleasant hotel, recommended by a Hong Kong resident ex pat. Not the best hotel we have stayed in in Hong Kong and this was our 10th visit. We were upgraded to De-Luxe but frankly could not fathom why it was so called. Had great view of the waterfront and perhaps that is why. The room was light and airy and house keeping was excellent but overall it was a little tired. The room also appeared to have been designed for smaller races than Europeans as the bath was small and we had to duck under the shower but these are small matters. The bed was queen size and comfortable. Position good enough and plenty of eateries nearby and a Delifrance opposite for breakfast ( although the service was appalling and slow with aggressive staff and some clearly did not love their job or their customers!!) For a new visitor to Hong Kong I would recommend a hotel closer to the heart of things back towards Tsim Sha Shui ( this hotel is in Tsim sha Tsui East)or for better value in Jordan or Monkok. Did not choose to eat in the hotel at all as the prices were very high compared to local restaurants although they all appeared to be attractive and well appointed. Rooms surround a central atrium which is very attractive and is viewed from open lifts and the corridors to the rooms. However this does mean that cooking smells drift up to the rooms from the main restaurant where there is some cooking at open grills taking place and also noise from the entertainment can be heard in the rooms from ,say, 7pm to around 10pm Overall, whilst this a decent hotel, a visitor can do better elsewhere although difficult to put a finger on why we were slightly disappointed. Maybe it is the price as with very poor exchange rate at present with 拢UK it cost us approx 拢150 per night.

<Content>An excellent short stay hotel We booked this hotel on the recomendation of friends and were not disappointed. Within easy walking distance of the waterfront, laser shows, views of HK island and yet a cool, calm oasis to retreat to at the end of a busy day. Skyclub membership came with the room and this was an excellent feature.Would definately reccomend the hotel.In hotel restaurants are expensive and there are so many alternatives you would be silly to eat in. We loved the chance to wander the area and eat in pavement cafes - preferably not the ubiquitous irish bar.Site -seeing is easy and we would recommend using the buses on Hong Kong Island and the metro in Kowloon. Out of the way in KwiWai is the Hong Kong Heritage Museam - well worth the visit and a bit different from the shopping mecca of HK island.

<Content>Superb Hotel Fantastic hotel based just minutes from the promenade in Kowloon. Staff very helpful from front desk to maids. Room cleaned every day, sometimes more than once! Complimentary bottled water and fresh fruit. Rooms exceptionally clean and even had a pillow menu! We did not get charged for use of the Sky Club, which we were expecting. Fabulous large pool, jacuzzi, gym and sauna. Almost always quiet. Pool attendants couldn't do enough for you. Very easy to get around with an MTR station just around the corner from the hotel entrance. All in all highly recommended.

<Content>Loved the Royal... We stayed here for 2 nights on our way to Europe. We booked this hotel based on the reviews on tripadviser and I must say that it was a good choice. The front desk was very efficient and upgraded us to a junior suite!. The room was very nice as was the huge flat screen TV! We didnt have any harbour views but considering the promenade is like a 5 min walk from the hotel it doesn't really matter. The restaurants in the hotel are very nice and provide a variety of dishes. The location of the hotel is execellent, walking distance to public transport and shops. We stored our luggage at the hotel after check out as our flight wasnt till late evening without any problems. The hotel also let us use the shower facilities in the pool/gym area to freshen up before leaving for the airport.I agree with some of the travellers who have mentioned about the shuttle bus from the airport express station, its very convinient as well checking in at the station for your flight.There is no need to lug your bags all the way to the airport which was great.Overall we were very happy with the service provided by the hotel and the location. It was a great start to our holiday.

<Content>Avoid this hotel!!!! This hotel is far below what a Western traveler should expect from a 5-star hotel. We booked through a travel agent in Macau for all 4-nights and were assured that we had access to the hotel's amenities. Upon arrival, we were told that we did not have access and that we could buy it for a mere $40 per day, despite already paying a fair rate for a 5-star hotel! It felt like we were being nickled-and-dimed. I tried to stay only one night and get a refund for the remaining nights, but the management was intractable and unwilling to help in any way. Thumbs WAY DOWN for friendliness and service. Not what one would expect from a 5-star hotel.

<Content>Great middle of the road hotel The Royal Garden is a great middle of the road hotel. Hong Kong, and especially mainland China tend to overstate their star ratings - many times leaving travelers disappointed w/ the $$ they are spending. In the TST East section of Hong Kong there are only a few really nice hotels to stay at: The Grand Stanford, Shangri-la, Intercontinental and the Royal Garden. The Royal Garden is probably the lowest on the list as far as upgraded, luxury rooms, but it is also the least expensive. It also happens to be in the triangle of the best area in TST East. The only downfall is you do not have a clear view of the Harbour -- but who cares, it's all about the location and EVERY restaurant in HK has harbour views, you will see the Harbour plenty during your stay in HK.Ok, back to the hotel... Great breakfast buffet, but it doesn't open until 6:50 am. Noise can be a factor in the hotel as it has an open atrium style floor plan -- meaning all of the rooms open out to the large atrium (sort of like a garden apartment) and there is a noisy restaurant on the main floor along w/ a piano player -- and he goes until around midnight or so. The beds are pretty comfortable and the TVs are extra large flat panels. The lack of wireless internet is a drag, and the fact that you must pay for it makes it worse. However, like I mentioned before, the location is prime and worth the trade-off.Try the Martini bar on the first floor - but beware of the cigarette smoke.

<Content>Great location and worth the splurge I'm not sure if it was because we'd just travelled for 15 hours, but the Royal Garden Hotel exceeded our expectations and was a lovely hotel to end a holiday in.Firstly, we arrived at 10am expecting to be told to come back at 2pm to check-in but we were given a room without any questions which, after an overnight flight in economy, is a god-send.The room was suprisingly large with a firm king-sized bed, big screen tv and the other usual amenities. The bathroom had a great shower-head, and was of a good size. Everything was spotless. We had a corner location without a view, but it was super quiet and the whole experience was one of comfort, ease and a little bit of luxury.Service from staff was prompt, friendly and polite. Came back from dinner to find our bed had been turned down and a plate of fresh fruit on the desk for us. The location is great - a nice walk to the ferry station, across the road from an MTR station and about 5 minutes stroll to Nathan Road. There is a 7-11 close by, and also a Starbucks and Deli-France.Whilst not cheap, the standard room that we booked at the Royal Garden still seemed to be good value for money and I would definately consider staying there again.

<Content>Probably good value ..but... Spent 5 nights in a Crown Twin Room (upgrade from executive which included hotel club facilities) The room had reasonable partially restricted harbour views. Harbour view rooms appear limited so you would need to request if views are important. The room itself was small and in need of updating . The club facilities were also looking a bit tired and not exceptional . Gym  roof top pool area were good, although again could do with a bit of an update. The hotel is well located in terms of being handy to shops transport restaurants etc and appears to be good value in comparison to other more expensive properties, which also appeared in need of a face lift.Overall the experience was good, without being wonderful...6/10

<Content>A great choice like the others have said..... I agree with the majority of the positive reviews and points already written so will try not to repeat them too much! Some of the key points are below! Positives - We had a deluxe room in a corner location and it was incredibly quiet. - Rooms are a good size (only saw deluxe ones but i cant imagine standard are that different) with everything you can need in them- Pool is as amazing as other people have said and the gym is v well equipped. - Location fab with metro (red line) a couple of mins walk and loads of restaurants and bars nearby- Housekeeping and cleanliness is top notch- Small shop on ground floor has lovely cakes and croissants and excellent service Negatives - Were not able to get the type of room we booked on check in even though we booked 4 months in advance. - Prices in the restaurants and martini bar make it a bit prohibitive for some guests to enjoy all hotel facilities. - No free computer/internet access for people without their own laptops. Overall an excellent choice for a stay in HK. We booked directly through website as this seemed to be the best option - remember that all hotels in HK add on a 13% service charge.

<Content>Great Hotel Booked standard - upgraded to Executive room free of charge. Large room with all amenities - extremely clean and comfortable. Having stayed previously on Hong Kong Island would recommend Kowloon as a much better location. Right next to waterfront (Avenue of the Stars) Close to MRT station and ferries.Staff very helpful.

<Content>Location, service, price I travel to Hong Kong on business and have found the Royal Garden to be a wonderful hotel for my needs. The service is excellent and the price is extremely reasonable. I had stayed at several other hotels before finding the Royal. I am finally satisfied with a great place to set up shop, yet be comfortable during my stay. The best choice I have found here.

<Content>Good service, great location, fantastic pool I was supposed to stay just for one night, but I end up staying for two and luckily because I've just met the amazing pool on the second day. It's a fantastic pool, on the 16th floor, and that has an all year round temperature of 27 degrees.The location is also great and the prices not as high as many of its competitors.Besides the rooms are spacious and full of small details that make our stay very pleasant.I hope to be back soon!

<Content>Superb!! Amazing luxury hotel, amazing city. Absolutely loved our trip to Hong Kong. The hotel is in a great location in Kowloon, 1 block away from the harbour. About 10 mins walk to Star Ferry, 5 mins walk to Nathan Road and shops, bars and restaurants in the same block. A great 5 star hotel and not as expensive as the near by Shangri La. Much cheaper than your average 3 star hotel in London. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Decent hotel with good service I have just returned from a 3 week working stay at the Royal Garden. I found it to be an excellent hotel with good service throughout. I had the Crown Club update which gives free breakfast in your room, free use of the pool/gym/sauna as well as free drinks and nibbles in the crown club between 5.30 and 8.30.I had a room on the 16th floor with a decent view of the harbour.Watch out for the prices in the Martini bar, but room service is decent value. All in all a confortable and clean hotel in a good location. I'd be happy to stay there again.

<Content>An excellent choice The Royal Garden is a wonderful place to stay. We had booked a standard room through Expedia (very cheap) but were allocated a superior room. The room was gigantic, as was the bed - I've stayed in rooms elsewhere which was smaller than the bed! Every facility you would expect plus more (newspaper, tea  coffee making, etc). The pool and other leisure facilities are out-standing. Staff very helpful. Restaurants looked good and were busy but we did not use them mainly because there was so much elsewhere to choose from (my favourite was Red Pepper on HK Island). From the room service menu, I would be surprised if they were more expensive than the going rate for good restaurants.The hotel sometimes feels slightly away from the main centres but on reflection this was good because it was quieter (though surrounded by restaurants, coffee shops, bars, etc.) and the walk along the front was great.A few tips: from the airport use the train to Kowloon and then the K4 courtesy bus (included in the train ticket) to the Regal Kowloon Hotel stop (next door to the Royal Garden). Buy an Octopus card at the airport (HK$50 plus what you put on it - I suggest HK$300 to cover the Airport Express, you can get a refund less HK$7 at the end and you can 'overdraw by HK$35). The subway from the Tsim Sha Tsui station goes with travellators to close to the hotel (exit P). Temple Street and the Ladies Market are tacky - go to Stanley Market instead and benefit from wonderful views on the way.

<Content>Royal Garden, a very good experience We stayed in a tripple rom on the seventh floor, very good room,excellent service.The hotel has an aura of evergreen elegance and grace, the staff was most helpful, the room service and housekeeping was super.The hotel is located close to everything that a tourist would like to see in HK, transport is virtually at door, the free bus from the Airport express station stops right next door. We can sincerely recommend this hotel to those who like clean, upmarket hotels that don't destroy the bank account.K family Sydney

<Content>Royal Garden Recommended Just come back from Hong Kong where we spent 8 nights at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kowloon. We found the hotel through tripadvisor.com (then rated in the top 10) and have to say that we were not disappointed. It was well appointed, the staff were helpful and friendly, the room (a deluxe room) was an excellent size, cleaned and maintained daily, and the amenities were excellent. The floor staff on our floor were exceptionally thoughtful.The hotel was about a 5 minute walk to an MTR access point, a 10 minute walk to Nathan Rd, a 5 minute walk to the harbour, and about a 20 minute walk to the Star Ferry terminal. It is far enough away from the noise and din of Nathan Rd to be nicely quiet, yet not too far away to be a pain. We enjoyed our daily walk down Mody Rd to the bustling strip of Nathan Rd.It is hard to think of any negatives, although the price was a little higher than expected, possibly because we booked a deluxe room. However, the service we received was excellent as was access to the Sky Club and Business Lounge, also the partial harbour views (which the hotel understated) were a bonus.We would recommend this hotel to travellers and would definitely consider staying there again if we go back.

<Content>Very comfortable and clean, very handy location A wonderful hotel, very clean and comfortable. Rooftop gym and pool were of very good quality and our room was just the ticket after a 12 hour flight.Location wise there's plenty of restaurants and shops nearby, the metro is just up the street, and the Star Ferry is a 10/15 minute stoll away.The breakfast buffet isn't great value for money as other reviewers have said but that's fairly obvious from a quick look around and it's not difficult to go outside and find somewhere else for breakfast.An excellent hotel for your stay in Hong Kong.

<Content>Fantastic hotel, fantastic stay fabulous hotel, great location in kowloon, about a 10/15 minute walk along the waterfront to the star ferry terminal. the atrium was beautiful and the staff were very friendly. we originally asked for a non-smoking room but they gave us a smoking room that smelt like an ashtray! eventually the moved our room to a corner room that was alot bigger than the standard room, but it overlooked the dirty backstreets where there was a sex shop with flashing lights...not a nice sight. appart from this everything inside the hotel was fantastic and clean. i fully reccomend this hotel !

<Content>Love the pool We elected to stay on the Kowloon side this trip and stayed at the Royal Garden having read good reviews on this site. We love this hotel. Our economy room was small but had comfortable bed, no view, but a good workstation and broadband. The bathroom was also small with the shower over the bath, but had great water-pressure; I liked the tap with filtered water at the wash basin. The putting green was a bit 鈥渇urry鈥? we didn鈥檛 use the saunas or tennis court, but the gym is well equipped and we just loved the rooftop 25m pool and jacuzzi with fabulous view of the harbour and comfortable loungers. We like Chinese food but NOT for breakfast 鈥?so enjoyed the RG breakfasts. Also had dinner at the Japanese restaurant one night, great meal but pricey 鈥?after that we went over the street where there is a choice of many restaurants. Highly recommend.

<Content>Very Good Hotel This is a very nice hotel that has a lower profile than many of the other 5 star Kowloon properties but has alot to offer. Location is 2 minute walk from metro station, across from Shangri-La Hotel and 5 minute walk to Nathan Road (as a frequent HK visitor, being 5 minutes off Nathan Road is a good thing). The rooms are decent size for Hong Kong and the bathroom and bed are high quality. The service has been very good, more like a smaller hotel. One of the main attractions is a huge rooftop pool (25 meters long), rooftop jacuzzi, rooftop tennis court and a very good gym. There are a number of restaurants on the property and they are offering hotel guests 15% discounts, but naturally there are hundreds of restaurants within a 5 minute walk. I normally stay at Shangri La but found a much better price here, so I gave it a try based on Tripadvisor reviews.

<Content>Great facilities We stayed in a standard room at the Royal Garden for three nights. Rooms were relatively small but very comfortable. The furnishings are high quality but quite dated in style - think old world glamour rather than modern chic. Bed was extremely comfortable.The best thing about this hotel are the fitness facilities. The pool is clean and lovely with a great view out over the river and across to Hong Kong Island. The gym was possibly the best equipped hotel gym I have ever used - lots of cardio equiptment, free weights, and resistance machines. Every piece of cardio equiptment has its own TV screen for entertainment whilst you're sweating it out! We didn't eat in the hotel as it was extremely expensive and there are loads of great and cheap restaurants within walking distance. Speaking of which, the location of the hotel, whilst not the best on Kowloon, was really convenient for getting around and we found we could walk almost everywhere we wanted to go in the vicinity and to the ferry terminal or train station.

<Content>Great hotel and location I had a great three night stay at this hotel in September. The location is ideal, just one block from the waterfront, 2 minutes to a ferry and 5 minutes to the MCR. It is a nice district surrounded by restaurants.The hotel interior is very attractive with a large central atrium suspended above another smaller shopping/check-in atrium. Going up in the glass elevator takes you from one attractive world to another.Rooms are large and with all the facilities expected from a 5* hotel. Beds are extremely comfortable and there's even a choice of pillows from the pillow menu. Every night the beds are turned down and a chocolate left on your pillow. TV's are large LCD screens with a good choice of international stations.The roof pool area is also extremely attractive, an oasis of tranquility away from the busy world below. It has a nice pool, a small garden with putting green, a well equipped gym and even a tennis court!

<Content>Very pleasant hotel My wife and I stayed there for seven nights. I was on business and my wife was sightseeing. We had a lovely view of the harbour. The room was large,clean and quiet. The room was cleaned in the morning and in the evening the bed was turned down, a chocolate on the pillow and the towels changed. We had buffet breakfast in the Greenery every morning and we had enough to eat to not need lunch. My only gripe with breakfast was that I would have liked more choice of Asian foods. The attention of the service staff was excellent. One example, a guest dropped a serving spoon on the floor and attempted to place it back on the servery. A waitress took the spoon off him, said something to him, took the spoon away and replaced it with a clean spoon. Hygeine is always a worry when in another country and it was nice to see them being careful.

<Content>Great stay at the Royal Garden My family and I stayed at Royal Garden for 3 nights and it was a great experience for us. The service was great. The room and washroom are very clean and updated. We have 2 little children with us and they have enough space to run and crawl around. There was also turndown of bed every evening (with fruits on the first night) with chocolate pieces placed on each pillow. The toiletries are great, with a set of shavers, toothbrush and toothpaste, on top of the normal set of toiletries. There is also a dispenser for drinking water (in addition to the flask to boil water), that we found was a rare gem. This is the first hotel we went that provides a dispenser for drinking water.It is near the DFS galleria (great for branded stuff such as handbags, cosmetics, watches, etc) and also walking distance to the MTR/KCR. You can go to the MTR via the KCR so its a covered walkway (has travelator). However, we noted that the food at the hotel is pretty expensive. Nevertheless, its relatively easy to find food in hong kong. We brought our breakfast at the hotel bakery on the ground floor which is really good. try the chocolate bun with chocolate filling inside. really yummy. There is a small restaurant/cafe opposite the hotel called Charlie Brown. The food there is pretty good, although you must go early or else there are not much stock left.We look forward to our stay at this hotel again. Will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful Royal! Have stayed at Royal Garden several times. However, this last time was personal trip and it is absolutely wonderful! Breakfast buffet in Greenery was wonderful everyday and rooftop pool and gym are wonderful. This is such a beautiful hotel and staff is so nice. Will continue to go back every time - love this property and location in Kowloon. Highly recommended at any price

<Content>Nice Hotel but... I had a pleasant stay at the Royal Garden Hotel. The room and bathroom were both clean. The beds and pillows were comfortable. Of course I loved the flat screen tv on the wall. My complaint is that we were given a room on the 16th floor and the elevator service is only up to the 15th floor. We were with our 2 small kids so it was such a hassle to be going up and down the stairs from the 15th floor to the 16th.

<Content>Great stay We stayed at the hotel for three nights, and thought it was a pretty good deal. The hotel doesn't look much from the outside, but its pretty spectacular from the inside. The rooms are a decent size - not huge but roomy enough for two. We loved the crisp white bedding and 42 inch flat screen TV on the wall. The bathroom was a little on the small side - but definitley okay. There is a fabulous roof top pool - didn't use it though as we ran out of time. We ate at Sabatini restaurant on the third floor, which had good write ups in all the guide books. It was pretty expensive but good food.The location of the hotel was pretty good. Really close to the Tsim Sha Sui promenade, close to the metro and only 10 mins walk from the huge harbourview mall and Nathan Rd. We booked online and got a good deal on advance booking. I would reccommend this hotel to others.

<Content>Get a corner room I stay at the Royal Garden for work on trips to Hong Kong, and I've had several different room locations. The rooms in the middle that open into the central atrium are very LOUD and the singer/piano player goes late in to the night and he's not great! This time I got a corner room 1008-- it had a view thru the buildings to the harbor, it was tucked in a corner and was so quiet and lovely.The Royal Garden is a nice, pleasant hotel, average decor and food but friendly staff. Try having a drink at The Balcony -- accessible from the third floor interior atrium restaurant. very cushy and swank.

<Content>Eighties retro heaven If you want to relive the glory days of the 80s this is the perfect place to do it. More marble and gold plating than you can shake your bouffant hairdo at. That said, the Royal Garden is a very comfortable hotel and we had a great stay there. Pretty good value by Hong Kong standards too.

<Content>Great Location, Rooms and Service We began our vacation by staying at this hotel and ended our vacation by staying at this hotel. On both occasions we were very pleased.In all we booked 3 rooms, all were ready when we arrived even though we were late and didn't check in until 4 AM. The rooms were a good size,large if your comparing them to European hotels and average if comparing them to North American hotels. All rooms were very clean, the beds were comfortable and the hotel was very quite. If you are there on business, there are internet hook-ups in each of the rooms and the charge for an hour was $70 HKD and $120HKD for a 24 hour period. If you haven't got the appropriate plug in remember to bring an adapter. If you're not travelling with your own laptop the hotel does have a business centre that charges a little more for internet service than your room.The service in the hotel was fantastic. There is a Martini bar on the main floor that is quite small but good for a meeting place. The hotel has 3 restaurants and the food for the breakfast buffet is delicious. We also had dim sum in the chinese restaurant, located downstairs, it too was fantastic.The location of this hotel was central. We went across the water to Hong Kong Island and it was about a 10 minute walk to the ferry station. Once on Hong Kong Island, if you want to go to Stanley Market you have to take a cab but it was very cheap $120 HKD. Stanley Market is like a big flea market with quite a bit of touristy stuff. I'm glad I went and saw but I didn't buy anything there.The hotel is also very close to Nathan Road, about a 10 minute walk as well. If you want electronics this is a good place to buy them. Very cheap in comparison to Canadian prices. If your looking for watches and Bags, this is the place to be. Just listen for the guys asking you if you want to buy copy watches or bags, their everywhere.Restaurants and places to eat are easy to find, all you have to do is walk around. We had some great meals but also took advice from our Frommer's book on Honk Kong-Highly recommended.

<Content>loved the Royal Garden On arrival at reception we found the executive room we had booked was not there for us. We were offered an upgrade to a suite for 拢30 for three nights which seemed reasonable.The suite was pleasant, L shaped with the bed rather squeezed into the small area.It was well appointed with good quality linens but it did need some updating. The bathroom was small but well equipped.Breakfast was an incredibly lavish if expensive affair with all tastes catered for - oriental ,continental or full English.The swimming pool and jaccuzi in the spa on the 17th floor were the piece de resistance. The setting was stunning with wonderful views overlooking the city.

<Content>We love HK It is a very good hotel to stay except too much noise during the X'mas time. Understand the people celebrate the holiday, but it will be better to cut down the singing after 11:00pm. Location is excellent, room is clean. Our kids love the plasma TV, but they were disappoint couldn't go swimming, because it is too expensive. It count by person HK$120 each, not by room.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We stayed at this hotel for a week in October. What an amazing hotel with superb service. We all felt very spoilt! It was definitely worth upgrading to Club Class which included full use of the fantastic pool and jacuzzi along with breakfasts, afternoon teas and evening drinks and nibbles.The rooms were spot on with lovely views of the sea - no problems at all with the servicing of the rooms. We loved the footlights in the bedside cabinets!Breakfast was the best we have ever had - what a choice!! The other restaurants were great as well.Thanks to everyone at the Royal Garden for making a superb holiday even better!!!

<Content>Not bad overall. When we arrived at the hotel, the exterior of the hotel had a slight 1980's look to it and I became a little nervous. I became even more nervous when we were shown our non-smoking two beds request and were given a queen which clearly reeked of smoke. Once the room issue was resolved, we relaxed into the hotel.The hotel had a wonderful glass elevator which allowed one to see all the floors and the buffet restaurant. The rooms were small (this is Hong Kong, afterall), but spacious. The beds had feather toppers and incredible duvets and pillows. I loved waking up to a 37 flat screen television every morning. Our room was at the end of the hotel, so we had a semi view of the water. I loved how they turned down our beds early evening and left a little chocolate.Although the staff were nice (the bellboys were hilarious), I felt a slight aloofness in their demeanor from the front desk to the business centre.Our last night at the hotel, we ate at the hotel buffet which had a wide array of cusine choices, but the best part was the piano player named Romeo who serenaded everyone (and took requests).The hotel is in a good location being close to the MTR stations, Nathan Road, and near other tourist sites.I would stay here again.

<Content>Watch for hidden 'service fees' This is a very nice hotel. However, the price I was quoted for the room was not the price I ended up paying. It seems they added on a bunch of hotel 'service fees,' which amounted to an extra 100 pounds. Not sure what these were supposed to be. They certainly weren't for room service. I have complained and am awaiting a response. So my advice is just be wary of hidden costs.

<Content>Great value in Hong Kong Kowloon Area We stayed at the Royal Garden at the end of a trip to mainland China, and were thrilled with the hotel, its location, its rooms, and the service. If at all possible, upgrade to a suite, in which case you have a wonderful view of the city, a beautiful big room with everything you could possibly want, and free use of the Sky Club -- the fitness center and rooftop pool -- which are beautiful and convenient. The restaurants in the hotel are top rated and the concierge is very helpful in finding and booking other restaurants as well as in providing directions and general help.

<Content>Great Value Hotel Booked thru Cathay Pacific Holidays at a good rate  was very pleased with the hotel  agree w/ the favorable writeups. It was a 1 block walk outside to the entrance to the MTR subways and KCR trains although you do have to walk a block or two underground-was handy during the rainy stay. Good breakfast  a beuatiful atrium  nice ambiance although I also agree the the Martini bar is very expensive-about $15 for a martini and about $10-12 for regular drinks but nice music  convenient.

<Content>Royal Garden Hotel - Fit for a King ! Having booked online slightly apprehensive about what the accommodation would be like - we needn't have worried! Absolutely gorgeous hotel, excellent service, spotlesss rooms, incredibly helpful staff. Dined at the hotel twice during our short stay and the food was sensational and fantastic value. Would recommend this hotel without hesitation. Location a short walk from the harbour - coldn't have been more pleased with our choice.

<Content>The best if not the only hotel for first time family travelers!!! Royal Garden Hotel:Had the best memories!!!Trip Advisory member from PHILIPPINESAugust 30,2006 It was December 23-27,2005..This may sound late but the memories were like it was just yesterday.. Upon arrival,we were treated so well that before we knew it,we were already in our beutiful room,big  clean comfort room,spacious beds,overlooking the different shades  blinks of city lights..Not to mention our ohhs  ahhs to the breathtaking entire view of the inside of the hotel while we were going up via the glass walled elevator @9th flr where our room was..I think it was the best feature of the hotel in terms of architecture design. My sons who were 75 never had any qualms on running around the floor,doing their usual stuffs even at the lobby's sofa as if they were at home.Needless for me to push them when they need to pee because they would volunteer to do it themselves..The atmosphere was friendly maybe especially so coz it was christmas.Thanks God my husband  i had the great relief seeing our kids sooo comfortable in the hotel.. Who could ever forget the best buffet breakfast?My travel agent said, never leave royal garden without having the buffet breakfast..We were glad we did!! We left swearing that we will never visit any other country yet, except hongkong..And of course,wherelse would we stay? Royal Garden..we will soon be staying with you again!!!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel  My son aged 10 and I stayed twice at the Royal Garden Hotel on route in Scotland during August. Although the outside of the hotel is nothing special the lobby and rooms were great. The room was a twin and by Hong Kong standards quite large with the nicely decked out bathroom. The Attrium with glass lifts was lovely. The breakfast buffet was very good, and the room service too was excellent. The pool on the roof was good, although cost HK 160 per person which I have never heard of, was fantastic. To get there was a bit of a hike with you going to the 11th floor by lift and then walking up to the 12th and through corridors. There was some renovation work going on so hopefully this will be remedied. The staff were extremely efficient and helpful to the extent that my son asked one of them to change the MP4 he had bought from Chinese to English and they were delighted to assist. They assisted us with our visa to Shenzen, although charged us a bit too much HK $500 each, it was more convenient and it was easier than queuing at the border. The location of the Royal Garden is fantastic to the MTR and I have have no hesitations in staying there again.

<Content>A Let Down the Royal Garden was in a great location, but the facilities were very much shadowed by the fact you need to pay extra to use the facilities. This has never been the norm becuase all the 5 Star hotels I have been staying in welcome you to use the gym sauna etc... but there has never been a sur charge, as well as extending your check out times, there was no negotiation to the extent which suits your timings, if you want to extend your stay, you must pay half day rates. So before you book please ensure you qualify your needs.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel--Forget the food! The Royal Garden Hotel in Kowloon is a god value for the money. If you are coming into Kowloon from the airport, however, be advised that the free shuttle does not stop at this hotel--in fact, the people at the train station tell you that the name has been changed. Nonetheless, the bus stops right next door, so it is is not really too much of a problem unless you are not aware of the circumstances. The food in the hotel is varied and incredibly expensive. The Sabitini, the award-winning Italian restuarant, is worth the money for the businessman's lunch. The Japanese restaurant though is a total rip-off. Labeled the Best Tempura in the last 100 years is ridiculous. The prices are beyond the reach of all but the fattest business account. I ate there one night with my nephew and together our bill was over $140.00 US dollars--and I had to go across the street for dessert! The staff are very helpful and courteous. The price for using the internet is $50 HK for 15 minutes--to say nothing of $5.00 HK per page for printing on a just next-level dot matrix printer. Find somewhere else to talk to the kids!

<Content>11th and 12th floor I stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel for three nights in 2006. The first two on the 12th floor and the last on the 11th floor. I knew the hotel was posh when I saw a Ferrari and about 10 Mercedes outside. When I arrived I was given the option of upgrading to a delux room for around $40 a night. For this I would receive my breakfast free of charge, have access to the Crown lounge and to the Sky Spa on the 17th floor amounst other things like afternoon tea and a free cocktail. In saying this my standard room also included free access to the Sky Spa and to the Crown business lounge. The reception staff were very nice and quick. The delux room was lovely. I had the usual bathroom with toothbrush, and various products by Neutrogena, a plasma TV, mini bar (expensive ,as they all are) and soft bed. There was no alarm clock which was a pity as I was worried that I would sleep in. A newspaper was delivered to the room every morning and I never saw the housekeeping but it was always done when I got back. The room also had a digital safe. The pool on the rooftop was amazing and it was nice to have a view of the city from their and relax in the jacussi. There was also a gym but I didn't go near it as I'm not that kind of person. Too lazy I guess. Anyway, I ate in the Garden Court restaurant the first night; I had half a chicken and some beef along with wine and plenty of green tea. The service and presentation was very good but I only liked the food rather than loved it. However the Jasmine tea was amazing and well worth trying even if you hate tea. The view from the glass lifts as you come down from the 12th floor are great. The hotel makes you feel special with its warm staff and luxurious surroundings. I would recommend it, thoug it is pricey. When you leave the hotel there are a number of shops very close by (if your looking for designer goods, they are everywhere and every bit as expensive as Paris, London etc). Its nice to walk around the Kowloon area and just window shop and look around and I felt that it was very safe though its a good idea to always look as if you know where you are going. The Royal Garden was in a very good location to the shops and subway and was a plesent place to stay. PS I was upgraded to the Pelican suite (at least I think that was the name) on the third day. This room was pure luxury with the best bathroom I have ever seen. This must be how wealthy politicians travel. Enjoy your holiday.

<Content>Excellent Hotel. Loved it! I was very impressed with the Royal Garden Hotel. The hotel atrium is gorgeous and my daughter loved going up and down the glass lifts to our room. Our room as quite large by Hong Kong Standards and I was very impressed. With all our bags and then shopping, it was good not to be staying in a shoe box (which I have previously stayed in, in Hong Kong). Whilst the views from our room (of the front of the hotel) were nothing to rave about, I would definitely stay there again. The staff were always helpful. The location was handy as it was only a short walk to the MTR and down to the star ferry. I was intially confused about whether I should stay on the Hong Kong island side or Kowloon side. However I don't think it matters as the MTR and public transport in Hong Kong is so efficient. Hong Kong is one of the easiest cities to get around. I mostly ate at fantastic local restaurants (that I found in my guidebook), and ate with the locals. And the meals were sensational. These were within walking distance of the hotel. However what I did find was that if you ate western food, then you paid triple. Avoid Tony Roma's in Kowloon unless you want to pay that much for a simple burger etc. Thankfully my little girl loves chinese food. However there is a McDonalds near the hotel if you or your kids can't go without. And there are plenty of convenience stores near the hotel too. I didn't book tours through the hotel as everything is easy to get to by foot or by public transport.One thing I would not do again is pay for coach transport to the hotel from the airport and back. Whilst it was super convenient being able to jump off directly at the hotel without carting luggage, the Royal Garden was last on the list and I visited every hotel in Kowloon first before arriving a very long long time later at ours. It drove me crazy. However with a small child it was easier. If I went back again now I wouldn't choose it unless I had hours to spare.A fantastic hotel and I think it is the best in Kowloon.

<Content>YES! The Royal Garden We loved this hotel. Check in was simple, the staff friendly and helpful (some knew more than others.) The best feature is the 70' exquisite heated rooftop pool and jacuzzi, with a lightshow every night at 8pm. Opted for breakfast at the Delifrance right across the street, also a Starbucks there if you prefer. Location is great - less crowded than the Canton Road hotels and quick access to many restaurants and shops on this side of TST.Easy access via the airport express train, only 2 stops from the airport to Kowloon. Then take a free courtesy shuttle that drops you off at the hotel. Hop on the #4 going to the Regal Kowloon Hotel which is only steps away, next door. When you catch it back, you can check your luggage directly at the airline desks inside Kowloon station where there was NO line. You arrive at the airport, boarding pass in hand, lugging no bags.

<Content>Home from home. A hidden gem I've stayed at the RG several times for both business and pleasure. As an all rounder, you can't fault it. Good location, good service, some good restaurants, great cocktails in the Martini bar and one of the best views from a swimming pool ever!If you can afford it, spend the extra on a club room, for a larger bedroom and a really nice communal lounge area with drinks and nibbles.

<Content>Fantastic hotel We loved it here! Stayed 3 nights on a topover to Australia. Great location - lovely walk along the harbour front to central Kowloon and we had a lovely view over the harbour from our room. The room was very comfortable with nice touches such as chocolates on the pillow and slippers. The atrium was beautiful and we loved the glass lifts. The Martini bar was a bit tacky - we preferred the bar at the Intercontinental down the road - beautiful views over the skyline and great cocktails. But the Royal Garden was a great place to stay and I would definitely return there on any future trip to Hong Kong.
