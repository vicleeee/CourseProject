<Content>Pretty basic Like a lot of people at this hotel we were taken here when our flight out of Amsterdam broke down. 2 flights from different airlines broke down at the same time and around 200 people were then waiting at the 'shuttle bus' stop. When it finally arrived after about a 30 min wait the pushing and shoving to get onboard was hilarious. Again probably not the hotels fault but it was laughable.Upon arrival at the hotel it got no better, all desks were open and the queues were out the door, lucky enough we managed to get to the front of the queue and checked in fairly quickly.Room was, as all Ibis's, pretty basic, also found the room pretty stuffy, only had 1 towel so my partner had to go downstairs and battle the queues again to get a 2nd towel.Next morning the buffet was I guess acceptable.All in all a pretty basic hotel, but as others said it's huge and sort of like a cruise ship. It really is built for the airlines for when their flights breakdown and can send a planeload of people there!

<Content>Great room and clean! I stayed at the Ibis Schipol for 1 night as part of my Contiki tour. The check-in/out was very easy and the room was great. I booked a single and got a nice big room to myself. It was clean and very comfortable. The breakfast was pretty good as well.Having been to Amsterdam before, the only drawback was the hotel was a bit of the city. However there was a shutte that would drop you to the airport and from there you could catch the train into town.

<Content>Clean And Comfortable Stayed at the Ibis Schipol 2 nights during Trafalgar European tour. Front desk check-in was a breeze and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast next morning was absloutely great and the accomodation was clean and comfortable. A bit out of the city but easily reached by public transport. Would reccommend this hotel.

<Content>Never again - not a pleasant stay I stayed at this hotel during a recent conference in Amsterdam. The hotels near the conference centre were full and this hotel was suggested by the travel agent.The hotel has a free shuttle bus to/from Schipol airport every half an hour. However, thats as good as it gets. The check-in process was painful and the staff unhelpful. For instance, my room had been booked by the travel agent with costs to be charged back to the travel agents credit card. However the hotel claimed that they did not have any record of this. I therefore produced some paperwork to confirm the arrangement and then the lady at check-in said that they do not have anything from the travel agent and then stubbornly refused to check me in without my credit card. I gave my credit card and asked if she could confirm with the travel agent about the charges and once again she refused saying that it was not her job to do that. I phoned the travel agent up myself and they arranged to call the hotel to clear the issue up, which they did the following day.The room was basic and smelly. The bathroom had a dirty toilet and the sealant was black and looked disgusting. The room had a safe on the floor, which meant that you had to get on your hands and knees to add or remove contents - hardly very convenient if you have a disability.There are no tea/coffee facilities or hairdryer in the room. The TV is okay but only a limited selection of english channels.Breakfast cost éˆ§?0 and was average with poor service from the staff there. You are even expected to clear your own tray away - what kind of hotel is this!I am not likely to stay here ever again even though I travel on business to Amsterdam fairly regularly.

<Content>Not my choice My wife and I got booked into this hotel when our flight was delayed by 24 hours due to a technical problem. The hotel is pretty basic and not one that I would use if I had a choice.The good points are:- It's conveniently located for the airport with a free shuttle bus service.- It's clean.- You get a room with a bed.- The shower is good.The bad points are:- Not really convenient if you want a late night out in Amsterdam as the shuttle bus from airport stops running at about 1am. So only way to get back then is by taxi either all the way from town or from the airport. Both options are pretty expensive.- The room is very small and with only the minimum of furniture.- The beds are very narrow and keeps on moving around as they are on wheels.- The breakfast buffet is just about bearable.- The bathroom is very basic, and they only give you a tiny piece of soap and a miniscule amount of shampoo. Nothing else is provided. The towels are also very small.- There is no internet in the rooms, and also no free Wi-Fi in the lobby.- The hotel is huge and there may be a long walk from the reception to your room.We were in a double room that had two single beds pushed together. The room floor surface is laminate, and the beds that are on wheels moves around as a result of the slightest knock or even when you are simply shifting position in the bed. When I moved over to give my wife a cuddle the two beds instantly moved apart and had me crashing to the floor. This is not exactly convenient or comfortable, and definitely totally unromantic.The breakfast buffet was very basic. OK, I got what I needed to set me me up for the rest of the day but it wasn't an experience I enjoyed very much.In the reception area there are coin operated internet terminals. When I switched on my laptop it located several Wi-Fi networks, one which was called something along the lines of Free Wi-Fi Network. But the signal was very weak and I wasn't able to connect to it. The only network with a strong signal was the T-mobile Wi-Fi network.

<Content>Great Hotel for Transits in Amsterdam I stay at the Ibis Amsterdam Airport every summer on my way to North America from the Middle East. It is very close to the airport (10 min bus ride). When you get out of the Schiphol Airport there is a bus stop for hotels. Ibis bus is clearly marked. The hotel is pretty large. It is your usual Ibis - budget hotel with great service. The room size differs from one room to another. But on average the room size is ok for European standards..small bathroom though. No amenities in the room. You get a few movie channels and news. The restaurants in the hotel are quite expensive. Everey 20 minutes you can catch a free shuttle to Schiphol. The shuttle will stop at two other hotels in the area. I recommend that once you have unloaded your things you take the shuttle back to the airport and hop on a train to Amsterdam. It costs 6.50 Euros for two ways on the train. Then when you get back to Schiphol you catch the Ibis shuttle back to the hotel. If you are transferring through schiphol and have 8 plus transfer time you can book a room at the Ibis Airport for 6 hours. Great way to get some rest and refreshen up for your connecting flight. I recommend that you book through the Ibis website for this hotel.

<Content>Good value transit hotel This is the second time we have stayed here with our three year old and found it clean and comfortable. Our son was free and had his own bed in this hotel which is a major plus as many of the nearby transit hotels will not take an extra bed in the room. We tried the Etap hotel last time in Holland but it is definitely a class down from this hotel, and was just too small for three with luggage.The Ibis is large and has many hotel facilities including a few restaurants. The rooms are typical Ibis - compact but clean and comfortable. I found the bed a bit hard, if you like firm mattresses then this would suit you.We took the shuttle but it is very busy in the mornings and it is a bit of a crush. It is probably a lot better if you use it in the middle of the day.I am sure we will use this hotel again in the future because of its value, particularly for us as a family.

<Content>I liked it I really enjoyed staying at Ibis Amsterdam Airport for a couple of nights when visiting the town. The location is convenient to public transport, hotel shuttle bus was reliable and almost empty. Rooms were the good part about this hotel, relatively modern and definitely quite spacious. The furniture was functional and looked good, especially the built-in desk space under the window--lots of room to spread your papers if the need be. The bed was comfortable and big, and the bathroom clean and well-equipped. I even enjoyed the restaurant--simple but eatable food, decently priced. I would gladly stay there again if needed, good value and quality (at Ibis Star of Copenhagen, for example, the rooms as well as beds were about 1/3 in size as compared to Ibis Amst Airport). I would recommend that hotel to others.

<Content>Not worth staying here We stayed at this hotel this April. It is a very basic hotel, with almost no facilities in the room. The airconditioning was not working and the room is therefore very warm, even already in April. Read from other reviews this problem exists already for some time. The rooms a made and furnished with cheap materials and even basic things like coat hangers are missing. The airport shuttle bus supposed to run every 20 minutes, but has actually a very irregular timeschedule, taking between 15 and 35 minutes to come to the airport as it passes by other hotels as well. Try to avoid the place if you possibly can. Much better alternative which you can get for about the same price is e.g. the NH Hotel Schiphol.

<Content>If everything else in this price range is booked out... If you don't like the idea of being near either Amsterdam, or the airport, then this is the place for you! Even though planes are landing just over the road, without a car you'll feel pretty much stranded. (You would've thought they could build a hotel within walking distance of public transport). There is a shuttle bus to and from the airport: but since it services all four Accor hotels in the area, your trip time to and from the airport varies greatly depending on the route the driver takes. (And I pity anyone staying at the Etap, since the bus was always full by the time it got there). The room itself was fairly typical Ibis, so not bad (although our heater wouldn't turn off). It's the biggest Ibis I've seen, with a number of (bland-looking) eateries, and even a gift shop. If you have to get a really early flight, or everything nice in town is booked out, probably just stay here.

<Content>Functional We have used several hotels near Schiphol to use for a sleep before the flight and parking option. Our favorite being the Courtyard. But they now had no space and seem to be doing more difficult when it comes to parking for a longer period. I found a deal on the internet of 89 euro with 3 weeks of free parking included (no breakfast). That was the deal we were looking for because of our 3 week holiday. The hotel does what you need it for: a sleepover with parking facilities. The checkin went quick and nicely. The room was outdated and small. But they are redoing the rooms at the moment, so they should look a bit nicer in the future. The bathroom is small and was in need for refurbishment. (I guess our room had not been one of the redone rooms). The hotel is big and has a lot of rooms. The shuttle is a big plus over the Courtyard hotel: it is big and runs often. So no long wait from both ways. And it is free, whereas at Courtyard you pay 7 euro per person. On the other hand: Courtyard has breakfast included.Not all restaurants in the hotel were open. And the ones that were didn't appear too attractive. There is a McDonald's in walking distance, but we used the car to eat chinese in the town of Badhoevedorp. And with the free shuttle you could decide to eat at Schiphol or take from there the train into Amsterdam.We would stay here again with the same deal. Even though the hotelroom was not extremely comfortable.

<Content>Airport hotel blues We arrived at the Ibis, Schiphol after a week long vacation in Paris and Venice for staying overnight to take an early morning flight. We were spoiled silly by the excellent hotel in Venice and I guess that set our expectation high. Ibis is good as a transit hotel...well maybe not. The airport shuttle which picks up guests for all Novotel and Accor guests tends to be a little crowded (with a 30 minute frequency). On arrival at the Ibis, we were checked into a standard room, which means no temperature control, and bare basic amenities. No mini bar, limited toiletries (we were given just one small bar of soap) and a room telephone with locked outgoing access is definitely not a friendly place. The Wi-Fi is pay-to-use T-Mobile which can be a bit of an issue when you arrive at midnight and need to shuffle out of your room in your bed clothes to get Internet.I needed to check-in online for my morning flight out and I had some technical issues connecting to the site and needed help. The other alternative was to use the phone, which thanks to the hotel policy was locked. So here I was, sleepy as hell trying to get the phone unlocked walking all the way to the front desk only to be told that I could not get it unlocked until morning thanks to a system backup. I was also curtly informed that I needed to get my credit card authorized for phone access when the system came back online.Fuming and frustrated, I returned to my room only to find out that we had to share a small bar of soap between the two of us.The only reason why anyone would want to stay here is because its cheap (74 Euros/ night) and close to the airport. Given an alternative, I would avoid this place next time.

<Content>It does the job Having missed our connection in Amsterdam due to bad weather we had to wait till the following day for the next flight.This hotel is situated near to the airport and probably thecheapest option in the vicinity.It's not up to the standard of other IBIS hotels I've stayedat as the rooms are quite small and the decor a bit dated.Also there are no attractions near apart from the airport soinevitably we got bored and took the train to the centre ofAmsterdam. There's a free shuttle bus which operates between thehotel and Schipol but it doesn't run at night so althoughwe got the train back from Amsterdam to Schipol we hadto get a taxi from there to the hotel.

<Content>Good choice if you have an early flight! We had an early morning flight back to the States from Schipol at the end of a recent European vacation and opted to stay at the Ibis near the airport. It was a great choice which made our departure very easy. The hotel itself is unexciting (not unusual for an chain, airport hotel) but it was clean and efficient and certainly geared for the air traveler. There were several adequate restaurants from which to chose for dinner. The shuttle was on time but as others noted, allow enough time as there are several stops along the way so the entire trip is about 20 minutes. The library in the lobby was a nice touch but as previously noted, the internet was very expensive. This would not be my hotel of choice for enjoying Amsterdam but it certainly met our needs allowing us to avoid the train journey from Centraal Station in the very early hours of the morning.

<Content>Convenient to airport, not noise proof Due to a cancelled flight, the airline put us up at the Ibis. Clean room, friendly check-in. They have a buffet just for those staying because of flight delays. Food wasn't anything spectacular, but nothing to complain about. Breakfast buffet is typically an additional charge, but we had it included as part of the airline package, so not sure what the cost was. A good variety for the breakfast buffet.My main complaint - the rooms weren't very noise proof. We didn't have a flight until later in the day, so planned to sleep in a bit, but could hear everything from the hallway, housekeeping in the nearby rooms.The shuttle to/from the airport was frequent, just a short wait both to and from the hotel.Overall, I'd recommend it for a place to stay for a layover or early morning flight, but otherwise, would probably look elsewhere.

<Content>Average hotel near the airport I was changing planes at Schiphol Airport and needed a place to stay over night. The hotel offers a free bus to/from the airport and the hotel. It run about every 20 min. (but not for several hours in the middle of the night). The hotel itself is just off the grounds of the airport. The rooms are clean and need. Service is fine but nothing special. Bar and food service are available at the hotel. There are no other places nearby, except a McDonalds, to eat or drink at.A good place to stay at between planes but nothing else.

<Content>Clean, basic, and cheap I recently stayed at the Ibis Amsterdam Airport before an early morning flight out of Schipol. The complimentary shuttle from the airport to the hotel runs very frequently - we never had to wait to catch it. The lobby is very nice - it has a cool library area with a large selection of books - something i've never seen at a hotel before. The room wasn't anything special - your typical European hotel room. Small and efficient. it was very clean though. A great deal for 79 euros a night.

<Content>Good hotel for airport stopover Whenever I fly out of Schipol/Netherlands, I stay at the Ibis the night before my flight. The rooms are a litte small, but they have a long counter along the window that is great for organizing the suitcases before going home. The rooms are always clean and the water pressure good in the shower. The shuttle service to the airport is on time. This hotel has a lot of people coming and going. Hotel staff tend to be stressed and for me they did not go out of their way to enhance my visits with them. Once when I was there, the elevator was broken, so we had to take our suitcases up the escalators - no one asked to assist us. They have a few restaurants inside the hotel. Not great food, but prices are fair. This is a noisy hotel, depending on the other guests. I've had some stays that are very quiet, and others when the high school kids are in town and are running from room to room. They have no smoking rooms. It is a very large hotel, but the price is good if you just need a place to sleep before catching your flight.

<Content>Standard Hotel I had to stay a night at the IBIS because my relatives weren't around. So I checked in the Amsterdam area, where you can get a quite normal cheap sleep.Nothing really found except the IBIS.I had to say that the room was clean the Shower was ok but a little funny smell in the air... (I guess from the cleaning spray or so)Also I was with a car and was surprised that the parking wasn't for free then they ask already enough for a night... in my point of view...Anyway ok but not the best...

<Content>Not convenient to the city, but a nice hotel. I stayed at this hotel with my Contiki tour group and was fairly impressed with it. The rooms were a decent size for a European hotel, and our room was very clean; also, we arrived at 9 AM and they were nice enough to check us in right away, even though check in wasn't until 2 PM! However, this hotel was not convenient to the city center--your choices were to either take a cab for around 40 euro one way, or take the free hotel shuttle to the airport and then take the train into the city for around 7 euro roundtrip. If you're only going to be in Amsterdam for a few nights, as we were, you might as well spend the extra money to stay closer to the city.We also had breakfasts included during our stay here, and the breakfast buffet was pretty impressive for Europe, which was nice.

<Content>Reliable Ibis performance Just confirming Niall's opinion. Considering the free shuttle and the good traffic connection to downtown, this is real value for money as compared to usual hotel rates in Amsterdam.Rooms are small, breakfast OK, but not included. The hotel shows the traditional reliable ibis performance but could do with some attempts of redecoration. The bus travels about 20 min. to the airport.As a transit place however it guarantees that you will never be alone there and that all neighbours are within shouting distance ....

I wouldnt recommend it for people who want to explore the centre but it was great for a one-night layover. The French restuarant had really good food at decent rates, plus there was a bar and 2 other options for dining.Hotel room was clean, small (but it is Holland) and hotel in general was really large but easy to navigate.Service was good (no room service!), and again...FREE SHUTTLE!

<Content>Decidedly average I stayed at this hotel for one night to catch a morning flight. The location is only convenient if you are in transit like I was. It had a fair share of airline crew staying.I had a room on the ground floor which was relatively small. Everything was clean. The safe was in working order, but too small to fit my 15 screen laptop. The hot water in the bathroom could not be regulated properly, the temperature was fluctuating a lot. It wasn't a big issue, though. There was some noise from airplanes.The hotel offers wireless internet access for high rates. I purchased a three hour timeslot. The speed was very slow, much too slow for a 802.11b network. The network is not secure. My firewall software detected frequent hacker attacks. I was barely able to check my e-mail. I advise against using it.The breakfast buffet starts at 05:00, with a limited choice available from 04:00 - convenient for early birds. The buffet choice was adequate.The free shuttle bus to the airport takes more than 20 minutes. It stops at several other Accor hotels and might get crowded sometimes.I didn't use any other hotel facilities. Check-in and check-out were fine.

<Content>Transit Hotel, just as described The Ibis @ Schipol is convenient, generic, not expensive, and offers you more than a fair share of dining options. Its not a resort, or a business hotel, it is a transit hotel for the airprot, there is nothing wrong with it and its delivers as promised.Restaurants include a nice bar with friendly bartenders (Peter  Kim) ; and restaurants include an American Diner, an Italian eatery and also a coffee shop where breakfast and sandwiches are served. Rooms are clean, basic, and neat. Phones have automated wake up callsThe hotel has itso wn airport shuttle that works every 20 minutes so its real nice and you acn get it from Schipol hen you land and from the hotel on the way back.If you know you have to kill time, and dont want to pay Euro 100 at the Mercure at Schipol which is very dull, I recommend the Ibis. The Etam (also by accorhotels) is next door and cheaper at Euro 59. For more upscale options use the Hilton or Sheraton also across teh street from Schipol

<Content>A pleasant stay I paid 83 euros (including tax) for a double room (no. 1201). I stayed one night (in fact, for part of one night, since I arrived at 23:00 and left at 5:00). Breakfast was not included; it was an extra 11 euros per person.There's a free shuttle bus between the airport and the hotel from 5:00 to 1:30 at least once every 30 minutes. The trip takes about 10 minutes.I didn't stay in the hotel very long, but it seemed nicely equipped; I saw a bar and a gift shop. The room was a nice size, as was the bathroom. Although my room was the first in the corridor, I had no problems with noise.I only had one prior experience with an Ibis hotel, in Prague, where I found the room cramped. This hotel was a pleasant contrast and the room was fully satisfactory.I didn't try the breakfast, which seemed too expensive; I had breakfast in the airport instead, before my flight.I found this hotel well worth it.

<Content>Only stay if you must Only advantage is the fact that this hotel is 5 mins bus journey from the airport.We missed an ongoing flight so were put up here for the night by KLM.Free buffet.......my dog would have stuck his nose up at it!Room very small, very basic.Luckily we were only here for 8 hours. Don't go near unless you have to!

<Content>Do You Miss Your University Dormitory? My wife and I used the Ibis Amsterdam Airport Hotel for one night enroute from Madrid to Chicago. We picked up the hotel's shuttle outside Schipohl along with other weary travelers at 1:00 A.M. The hotel is quite large with hallways spread out in different directions. Check in was quite chaotic as the seemingly over worked staff attempted to accommodate many customers. The elevator is rather small and looks like something utilized in a meat packing plant. The hallway walls were white with tons of scruff marks and holes, with no decoration other than the occasional flyer. It looked like a Freshman dorm in a large university. On entering our room we were taken a back by the intense stuffiness and heat and attempted to work the air-conditioning system which appeared out of order. I called the front desk which informed me that the hotel did not have air-conditioning, they had an air cooling system that did not work when the temperature was high. This seemed to be the ultimate oxymoron. The room itself was an okay size with fake Scandinavian modern furnishings that have seen better days. The carpet had the perverbial stains and cigarette burns. We were a bit hungry and searched out the hotel's coffee shop. It was quite amusing as none of the escalators in the hotel were working. Perhaps this was caused by the high temperatures. The coffee shop was filled with young revelers who were on a group tour. It seems the hotel caters to the group tours that cart young singles around Europe. Perhaps the dormitory theme is purposeful. However, for my wife and I the one night was uncomfortable and we did not sleep vey well as the warmth of the room and the saggy bed did not help create a restful evening. Luckily we were simply living out of our suitcases for the one night as the room nor the bathroom had much storage. The bathroom is what you would expect from the cheapest motel. At 79 euros, the Ibis Amsterdam Airport Hotel is not worth it, and we will stay at a different establishment next time we have a layover at Schipohl.

<Content>Not recommeded! We were put up in this hotel by the airline after volunteering to take a later flight back to the US. What a disapointment. Although the room was clean, the beds were so hard we could barely sleep. The tv was tiny, about 16, and far across the room, making it nearly impossible to enjoy the last World Cup game. We had agreed to stay another day because we had fallen in love with Amsterdam, but if we had stayed at this hotel the first time, our experience would have been far below expectations.

<Content>very satisfactory stay Spotlessly clean room, nicely decorated in light colours. Breakfast buffet adequate, but with plus points for very good rolls, fresh fruit salad and good yogurt. French and Italian restaurants inside the hotel, as well as as an American Hamburger Bar open until late. Tried the last one: Good food there and very friendly service. The shuttle bus service is among the best of all the Schiphol airport hotels. The last bus to most other hotels leaves from the airport at about 1130pm, which is really awkward if you want to spend an evening in Amsterdam since you actually have to take a train from the city in good time before 11 pm. But the IBIS bus keeps going until about 0130 am, and then starts up again only a couple of hours later in the morning. One drawback, though: This hotel doesn't offer luggage storage, so if you're checking out in the morgning but leaving Amsterdam later in the day, you either have to check in your bags at the Central Station in Amsterdam, - or do an early check-in at the Schiphol airport, without necessarily going through security though.I will definitely stay at this hotel again, though I would naturally prefer to stay more centrally in Amsterdam, if rooms were available at a more reasonable rate than is normal in that city.

<Content>Disappointing We specifically wanted to stay in this hotel when we visited the Netherlands again, as we have stayed here before without problems.Well, we got to the shuttle stop outside the airport and waited for a bus. And waited. And waited. A shuttle bus finally came but there were already loads of people waiting so we didn't manage to get on this one. Although we have a baby in a buggy, all of the people there were pushing and shoving to the extent that there was literally no room in the shelter from the sleet for my daughter. I practically had to barge my way through a crowd so she could stay dry! I know this isn't the hotel's fault, but what really cheesed me off was that while the bus was at the stop, I called the hotel and explained that the bus was full and asked how long another one would be. I was told 5 minutes. 30 minutes later another bus finally showed up. We managed to get on this one. Just.Check-in took forever due to stranded KLM flights, but a kind man let us go in front of him to check in, even though we were half way to the back of the queue, which was very kind indeed. Probably because my 2 year old was being a nightmare. Anyway, we get into our room and everything seemed fine. Until we tried to use the safe.The safe kept showing error so I tried to call reception with the room phone. Only when I pressed the reception button, it took me through to voicemail. As we were about to leave for dinner, I stopped off at reception and explained the problem with the safe and the phone. We went up for dinner and assumed the problem would be sorted by the time we got back to our room. WRONG!When we gt back we tried to set the code again, but it still wouldn't work, so I called reception. The phone still wasn't fixed, so I walked down to reception yet again to ask why this hadn't been done. A manager came back to the room to have a look at the safe. He told me that the battery was flat and that he was not able to fix it that night, but he would make sure it was fixed the following day, Saturday 17th. He offered the use of the safe behind reception to keep our passports and return tickets in the meantime. The next day we went out and when we returned to the hotel at around 8pm, we went back to the room and the safe and phone STILL weren't working. By this time I was pretty annoyed and went to reception, and complained that I had been told that the things would be fixed today but they still weren't. I also reminded them that they have a 15 minute satisfaction guarantee where if you have any problem with the room, they would sort it out to your satisfaction within 15 minutes or you would get a refund. I said that I could understand that the safe might not be fixed as there was nothing that the manager could do, but that it was no excuse with the phone. By this time it had been nearly 24 hours since making the original complaint. I was told I would receive a refund of one night's stay, minus breakfast, which was fair enough. In the meantime, we asked that we use the safe in reception to keep our valuables. We put some more things in another envelope and left it there.Because we were checking out on Monday morning, we decided to get our valuables back on the Sunday night. When we got the envelopes, one of them was open. I was concerned about this but there were several people at reception, and I did not want others to see the valuables. When we got back to the room, we emptied the enveloped and realised that a set of keys was missing.At this point I marched down to reception and waited for a couple of moments until I caught someone's eye and requested that I speak to a manager. When the lady came out, I explained that we had got our valuables back from the safe, but that there was an item missing from one of the envelopes. I asked her to check if it was still in the safe. She said immediatly that there was nothing in the safe. Because I have a talent for my voice carrying, and the fact that there were quite a few people in reception, I reminded her that because we saw the envelope sealed when we handed it over, and that it was open when we got it back, either it was in the safe or someone behind reception had taken it. She went to look in the safe again and came back with the keys. Only thing was, she had the cheek to tell me that I should have sealed the envelope better! When I said that it was her boss that sealed the envelope, she just said that maybe in future they should use sticky tape. Indeed!!Food was OK but expensive and certainly not value for money. Cooked breakfast consisted of boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, sausages and beans - no bacon, toast or anything else. There was bread but no facility to toast it!!The family room we had was 1431 and my daughter's bed had a metal catch on it so that it could be turned into a desk. Not very sharp but it would have been painful none the less. By this point though I was so cheesed off that I didn't even bother complaining about it.Next time we'll stop somewhere else!!

<Content>A good choice We stayed at this Ibis hotel for 4 nights in the beginning of May 2006.The hotel is very large with 644 rooms. Some of them are no-smoking rooms.There are several cafes and restaurants (one is 24/24)and their price is in the medium range. The room is well equipped, not large but enough for two persons. In the hall you can find a cafe, a relaxing area, internet points (30 eurocents a minute!),telephones, souvenir shop, pub Red Baron, reception.There is a free shuttle bus to and from the airport. From the airport it takes 7-8 mins, to the airport it takes longer ( about 20 mins) because it stops at Etap Hotel and at Novotel. The shuttle service starts at 4:30 and it ends at 1:30. Usually the service has an interval of 20 mins. It is usually on time but be aware to be ready a few mins early because if the bus is full the drivers start a little earlier! The staff is usually friendly. The problem is the waiting time at check-in. This because the most of guests arrive by shuttle bus and this means that at the same moment there are at least 20 persons who want check-in while the counters are just 3 or 4.You can reach the center of Amsterdam by train from the airport or ( this was our choice) by bus 192 with a connection with tram 1. Just outside the hotel there is a bus stop called ibis hotel for the line 192 which goes from the airport to the station Amsterdam Sloterdijk. At the stop Baden Powellweg you can transfer to the tram line 1 which goes to the Central Station passing trough Leidsplein and the Dam. The total time for bus-tram option is about 40 mins. You can buy a one day pass on the bus or a 3 days pass at the tourist information at the airport.This hotel was a good choice and its price is very competitive.

<Content>Good airport hotel A very large hotel with a wide range of catering outlets. The rooms are well equipped. A shuttle bus runs every twenty minutes to a published timetable which I found was adhered to, taking ten minutes from the airport and twenty minutes to return. My only gripe is that there are not always enough check in positions open and an extra clerk would be welcome at busy times. If you need an inexpensive airport hotel I would recommend this one.

<Content>Pleasant Surprise! I was stuck at the Ibis due to the cancelled flight on KLM. I didn't expect much knowing Ibis to be a chain for budget travelers; however, I was pleasantly surprised upon arrival. The staf was friendly and very quick. There were 3 restaurants and a buffet to choose from as well as a fully equipped bar. I was tired so I took a bath in a huge bathtub and than I ordered an hour of a full body massage!!! Pretty crazy for a budget hotel. Massage was great and it was done professionally in my room so I didn't even have to go anywhere. Food, dinner as well as breakfast, were tasty. There also was available internet and free airport shuttle. Over all, I was very happy with my stay at the Ibis and if i will ever have overnight layover I'll be sure to return!

<Content>for the price , great hotel After a long flight from the USA we expected to have to sit in the lobby until check in time (3 pm). We were greeted by a very lovely lady who checked us in at 9 am. The rooms are small and I thought that being near the airport might be noisy but not so. The bed was a little hard for me but I'm used to sleeping on a $3,000 bed! Breakfast was great, good selection. Rode the shuttle to the airport, it was nearly full but they came by every 20 minutes. It's a fast trip on the train to Amsterdam city center. I'd sure stay here again. We paid $68 USD. A steal for Amsterdam. If you flew in on KLM there was a free dinner that looked good. If you are planning on shopping in Amsterdam this place it too far out of town, but as a place to stay until you get your nights and days straight it's great.

<Content>Terrible, terrible, terrible I stayed in the Ibis Airport hotel because I was to fly out of Schiphol early in the morning. For the amount of money paid we didn't expect much. And rightly so, it feels like university dormitory complex, large and tasteless. I accidentally left my electrical toothbrush in the bathroom. I immediately called back to the hotel to warn them. The toothbrush had not been found. How unfortunate. I wrote to the manager about it, voicing my concern that it had might have been taken by the cleaning staff and received a rude letter back that they didn't appreciate people accusing their staff of theft. Rather than him being concerned with my satisfaction, he hid behind his Algemene voorwaarden, in essence, too bad for me. The way it has been handles, and especially the tonality has put me off Ibis for life.
