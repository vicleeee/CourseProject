<Content>Refreshingly modern, spacious, bright, and sufficiently away from the crowds The Pullman Paris Bercy is a modern, smart, and sophisticated offering in this historic but newly-reconstructed part of Paris. Formerly a sea of small wine warehouses (some of which have been converted into stylish restaurants, shops, and other boutiques facing a pedestrian mall), the hotel, just like the area it is in, is modern, bright, and convenient. Though somewhat of a distance from the charming center of Paris, Metro Line 14 whisks passengers there at in only minutes at high speeds in very modern cars. I鈥檓 not sure I鈥檇 recommend this hotel for someone鈥檚 first visit to 鈥渞omantic Paris, but for the business traveler or savvy repeat visitor to Paris, this is a refreshingly modern (an reasonably priced alternative) to the somewhat worn or overpriced hotels which are found closer to the city center. The lobby is spacious and colorful, the staff are exceedingly friendly and professional, and everything in the room and elsewhere in the hotel was in great working order. Though the room was equipped with large windows, the sound insulation is excellent, and it was a very restful hotel experience. The distance from town can be a bit of a nuisance, but traveling to even the farthest destinations on the Metro (you鈥檒l nearly always have to change at least once) doesn鈥檛 seem too long. I鈥檝e become a bit bored with 鈥渢he same old Paris,鈥?and I can鈥檛 afford the nearly thousand dollar a night five stars. This hotel offers a wonderful combination of style, graciousness, modernity, and convenience. You won鈥檛 walk out to the sounds of accordions or greeted with artists in berets, but if you stay at the Pullman Paris Bercy, you will be surrounded with tasteful appointments, an efficient facility, and an eager-to-please and extremely professional staff.

<Content>Perfect solution to city break hotel! I was planning a Paris break for my girlfriend as her Christmas present, for 3 nights over New Years 08.Before I continue writing, I must let you in on a secret... I'm an obsessive planner! I like to know all the details before I go somewhere, so I intend to list all the things I would have wanted to know here for you, so you can make an informed decision.First off, travel from airport to the hotel. We used the taxi from the airport, standard 5 seat car, and it cost 43 euro to the door. I tipped him 7 euro, but apparently this was way above the going rate. It took 30 minutes, and this was at 10pm.If I had known the city already, perhaps the Roissybus to Opera, then Metro system to the hotel would have worked just as well, and been half the price. But late at night, we just wanted to get to the hotel!On arrival, with my shaky french I was worried we'd struggle checking in. Not an issue at all. The desk staff spoke very clear, polite English, and in a matter of minutes we were in our room. Perhaps because I booked 3 months in advance, we were upgraded room type on arrival, which was a very pleasant surprise!We opted not to have breakfast in the hotel.... 27 euro each seemed ridiculous. Instead, if you cross over the road to the Bercy village, there's a Starbucks (within 200 metres of hotel door), where you can get breakfast for two for around 14 euro. Much better option in my opinion.The metro station is beside Starbucks, so you'll be heading in that direction anyway. If you've never used a metro system before, don't worry... The french metro system is incredibly efficient. As we were only there for 3 days, we each bought a carnet (a pack of 10 single tickets) for 11 euro 40 each.The ride into Madeleine station was approx 7 minutes (Line M14). So in other words, do not worry in the slightest that this hotel is slightly out of the way... it's extremily accessible due to the great metro system.There are restaurants in the Bercy village beside the hotel (Bercy village is really just a strip of shops and restaurants), but most of these were closed when we stayed.Room service in the hotel is a great option is you're feeling lazy, and the pizzas we had were both big, and very tasty.Erm... what else. The rooms are very nice, with the queen sized bed being very comfy. Our minibar was free for our upgraded room, and was re-stocked every day. Bathrobe and slippers were supplied, and used!!!The free TV channels are limited (CNN, Sky News, BBC News), so we ended up paying to watch Hancock for 12 euro one night. I would say the only thing that let me down was the TV... but then, you're in Paris! Who needs TV?!?! Oh, the TV is a 32 inch LCD, so it's enjoyable to watch.All in all, an excellent experience at this hotel, and I wouldn't think twice about staying again. Same opinion from my girlfriend!Paris is a lovely city... enjoy!!

<Content>Travel Agent Visit Newer hotel in the southern part of Paris. There is great train service into the city center and the station is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Travel time on the train is about 7-10 minutes away from the city center. Rooms were fine and a typical size for Europe standards. The Bercy area is in a upcoming business district and you will see all the buildings are new. There are some local shopping and restaurants near the hotel to enjoy. A 5 minute walk and in the direction of the train station. I was part of a tour group and this hotel was picked for your trip. It was a fine choice. Travel time from the airport to the hotel in heavy traffic was one hour.

<Content>Should have saved this for last! We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights as part of a guided tour through northern France and this was our favorite hotel by far! It's in a great part of town, away from the busiest parts of town but accessible to the Metro and cool, less busy things to do. The room was so comfortable with fabulous down comforters and overall was a great place to rest our heads for a couple nights. I wish all of the hotels on the tour were this great. I recommend this hotel with no hesitation!!

<Content>Gold standard as usual. The hotel offered gold standard as usual. The Pullman Hotel and Resort Bercy Paris is getting more and more better on the service and the comfort. I would like to say that this hotel should be a five stars hotel because this hotel provide all the facilities you need. Except a swimming pool. Maybe it's why the hotel is not a five stars standing hotel. Bercy is lovely you have a Starbucks coffee, a typical italian restaurant, american, cinemas...

<Content>Great Midweek break My wife and I had a great Midweek stay at the Pullman Bercy at the begining of August. We were looking for somewhere comfortable just for one night before catching a train to Venice the following evening.The hotel is easy to get to from the Metro (about 5 mins walk) and being one of the newer lines were able to use escalators to get to street level rather than dragging heavy cases up steps. The hotel was conveniently situated close to the attractions of Bercy Village, a pedestrianised block or two of resturants and niche shops. We didn't try any of the local resturants but they seemed to be popular with the locals although they did look a little on the pricey side. Because we only had about 36 hours in the city we didn't spend much time in the area but headed off to the main attractions nearer the centre of the city. Some people mentioned the hotel as being a bit remote but we found that even watching the lights get switched on on the Eiffel Tower at 10 o'clock from the Trocadero we managed to be back at the hotel within 35 minutes. The hotel was very comfortable, the staff friendly and helpful and were happy for us to leave our bags for a few hours after checking out so that we didn't have to drag them round Paris before catching the train in the evening. We also didn't have breakfast. We too throught the E27 price charge was a bit steep but looking around Bercy Village a bit later most places were around the same price for breakfast. On the whole I would go back, certainly mid-week because we got a good rate, and would recommend it for a night or two.

<Content>Beautiful, Clean, and Roomy The Pullman Bercy (formerly Sofitel) is a spacious, clean, and modern hotel just steps away from Bercy Village. We stayed 4 nights and enjoyed our time at this hotel.Pros:Quiet, A/C, big king-size bed (although we were told queen), fridge, access to metro (Cour St. Emilion stop on purple 14 line - one stop away from Gare de Lyon which is a major intersection), close to restaurants and a few shops. Excellent and very affordable wine store at Nicolas in Bercy Village - also a good restaurant. Get their house brand of wine. Bottle from store is less than 3 euros.Cons:No breakfast cafes, no stand for a croissant and coffee. There is a restaurant at the bottom of the Ibis across the street with a great buffet for 9 euros, but nothing cheap, easy, and quick. Dinner restaurants in Bercy were nice, but lacked some of the charm of the Latin Quarter or Marais areas. Very popular and great people watching. Hotel is perfect for anyone who needs a nice, cool, and quiet room. For some of us insomniacs, this is critical and rare in Europe. We were not any further away from sights than anybody else in the city. Don't fear the metro as the 14 is the newest and fastest subway line in Paris. Yes, it lacks some of that charm, but we wouldn't have traded our wonderful nights of sleep on our big comfy bed for anything!Booked on Priceline. Paid $140 US/night plus taxes.

<Content>A real awakening I just returned from Paris on Monday 8/25/08. I was very pleased with the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff. The restaurant breakfast choices were excellent, would highly recommend this hotel due to its proximity to Bercy Village and the Metro station.My only complaint was the wake-up call did not come through twice as we had missed our trip to Versailles and we would have missed our flight home if we did not use my cell phone alarm. Their TV wake-up alarm was so very loud that it jolts your brain to the limit. All in all, I was pleased!

<Content>Average hotel The hotel is conveniently located in a quiet area south of paris, Bercy village, just a few steps from the underground station. Our room was clean and comfortable, however not certainly up to a 5 stars hotel. Staff was very unfriendly, expecially at checkin: we arrived one hour earlier and we were told no room was available yet, even if they did not check for vacancy, and even if the hotel was almost empty.

<Content>Pullman Bercy, great hotel, great stay This was my first time in Paris and I'm not a experienced traveller so I was thrilled with my hassle free stay at the Pullman Bercy. Located in a family friendly area and a great base from which to travel into central Paris for sightseeing.I don't know why this is only a 4-star hotel and not a 5-star one.The staff were polite and helful espeically when it came to advice on where to go shopping and other tourist-type questions. There was some reburbishment work going on in the lobby but it didn't affect our enjoyment as disruption was kept to a minimum.We stayed on the sixth floor and our room (one double bed) was the size of a similar room in a 4-star hotel in London. It was big, had a wide screen tv, a fridge and the bathroom was clean and spacious.The hotel is about 2 minutes walk from Cour St. Emilion station (line 14, purple) and you can get to Gare de Lyon in about 10 minutes. The number 24 bus stop is one minute's walk from the hotel and that also takes you into central Paris within 15 minutes.The hotel in located in Bercy village which has some nice restaurants, a multiplex cinema, a Tabac, cake shop and there is a branch of the Franprix supermarket chain about 5 minutes walk away. A good place to go to stock up on bottled water, fruit, snacks etc without paying higher central Paris prices.I booked my stay on the Eurostar website along with train tickets. It worked out at around 拢50 a night for two people.When I go back to Paris I will try to stay at the Pullman Bercy again.

<Content>Unexpected fabulousness! We stayed for 2 nights here and wanted to stay longer but they were sold out of rooms. It was a bright, beautiful and CLEAN hotel located near a pretty cool area called Bercy village where there was a movie theatre, shops, cafes and bars. Location wise it is not downtown Paris, but it is on the metro line. To get there, take the subway to St. Emilion not Bercy, (like we did-big mistake). It takes about 10-15 mins to reach city centre. Breakfast is very expensive, skip it and buy a croissant instead at the neighbourhood pastry shop.

<Content>Soul less modern expensive hotel Yes the room was ok, the food was good quality and nearby Bercy village is nice but the hotel is very expensive for what you get. Paris is an expensive city but the hotel isn't exactly in the centre of the town and there is nothing to make it stand out and justify the price. It is just another modern expensive hotel and I wasn't impressed.

<Content>Big and Clean Hotel I did not book this hotel, as it was one of the many hotels we stayed at as part of a 10 Day Globus Tour thru France's wine country. This hotel was large and modern - which is unual for Paris. It was clean and the staff friendly. I have no idea if the rates are high as we did not pay for it ourselves, but came with the Tour. the is nothing much around this hotel, beside a walking path near the Seine. There is a small shopping and cafe village area nearby but nothing really historical or cultural. To see any of the major Paris attractions you need to either take the Metro (very nearby) or you need to take a Taxi. I would recommend this hotel if you don't mind taking the Metro. Besides the Fairmont in Monaco, this was the cleanest hotel of the 6 hotels we stayed at during our 2 1/2 week trip.

<Content>Friendly staff We stayed in Pullman Paris Bercy hotel with the family (child under 1 year). The staff was really very friendly and extremly helpful. The breakfast was very good as well, although the hot chocolat I asked for breakfast was only on the third morning really hot and perfect. The room was clean and just big enough, equipped with a mobile bed for our child. All in all, I would recommend this hotel for anybody visiting Paris.

<Content>Very Clean, Nice Property-Not the Best Location This property was chosen for a three night post river cruise package. It is in the process of changing from a Softel property to Pullman.The rooms are large and compare easily to a US Hotel in terms of amenities and size. The king bed was very comfortable, a large armoire with TV and honor bar. A large writing desk with computer access and nicely appointed bath.It appears to be a prime choice for business travelers. Continental room delivery breakfast was 27E (at 1.57 US per Euro) however it is within a block of a small mall area with a good selection of restaurants that appear to be chains. An English Pub, a steak restaurant, etc.The Metro is also located there and within a block from the hotel. However, it is some distance from the heart of the city and, given a choice, would spend more to be closer to sites.

<Content>Nice bed Stayed here for 5 days for buiness and weekend with family.Very convenient location for Cours St Emillion metro and street with restaurants.We stayed here because it was convenient for my office and Gare de Lyon. (its also best handy for airports)Getting into centre is ok by metro (4 stops - 10 mins) - taxi 20mins. Next time we might go for more central hotel.There's a great restaurant at top of tourist street (cour st emillion) called Aveyronnaise. Suasage and aligot (cheese mash potatoes) and biggest mille-fueille ever, lots of meat and foie gras. good prices.Hotel bed,like all Sofitels, was very comfortable. We like the way these hotels also put a duvet under the bed sheet. Pillows nice. Notice that even though its now a Pullman (positioned between Sofitel and Novotel) they are upgrading adding flat screen TV's and Nespresso machines next month.AND...internet access is free in rooms !!Modern hotel, clean, well run - breakfast expensive - nice bar with piano and good singer.Recommend it if you want to be on the edge of Paris and don't mind travelling into Paris. You will sleep well and be happy here.
