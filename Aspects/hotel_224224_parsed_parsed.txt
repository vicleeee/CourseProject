<Content>Beautiful Hotel, Excellent Service I stayed 5 nights at the Ritz-Carlton Central Park - presidential election week. I had booked a non-view room, but was upgraded without cost to a room overlooking 6th Avenue which I greatly appreciated. I could actually see a sliver of Central Park. If you are a light sleeper - the non-view room might be a better option, however. I noticed some traffic noise although I had the fan on the a/c unit running and this blocked out external noise.I'm not sure what I can add to all of the accolades from previous reviewers. I can say ditto to just about everything. Every staff person I interacted with was excellent and welcoming.The hotel is very beautiful and service is stellar. I especially enjoyed the beautiful Star Lounge although the prices are obscene - $20.00 for a glass of chardonnay - oh well, this is New York and the service and atmosphere are worth it.My room was not cramped, but not as generously proportioned as one would expect from a hotel of this caliber but the richness and beauty of the furnishings were quite wonderful and gave the room a sophisticated but warm and inviting glow. I really enjoyed quiet time in my room to rest and relax. The bathrooms are great - separate shower and tub - beautiful marble and outstanding Frederic Fekkai toiletries. I usually don't notice things like this, but the Fekkai products are amazing.Now for some minor whining on 5 points: 1. My room did not have a coffee maker in the room - arrrgh! This means calling room service, or dressing and going out for a cup of coffee in the morning. 2. Also, after the first night, housekeeping folded the beautiful bedspread and put it in a large canvas bag behind the reading chair. It stayed there for the rest of my visit. I thought this was odd - although not a problem. The bed was made with a very nice down comforter everyday and the linens were excellent. It just seemed odd to have such a beautiful bedspread folded in a bag rather than on the bed so it could be displayed and enjoyed. 3. The room also did not have an iron and ironing board for touch ups.4. Fitness Facility: Really not up to par for a 5-star hotel. It is a very long and narrow room with virtually no windows. There was very little space to do push-ups, crunches, speed rope, drop lunges, etc. It has the usual machines and a few free weights. The locker room is very small and I don't think there was a steam room or sauna. I work out almost daily so I notice things like this.5. No flat screen TVs - the TV in my room wasn't that great - mediocre picture quality although good enough just to watch the news and keep current on election results.Whining complete!Although I was there in early November, the weather was unseasonably warm and I was glad that the A/C worked so well. All whining aside, this is a great hotel in an unbeatable location. Especially for taking the subway. There are multiple lines within a short walk of the hotel. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and I would return.

<Content>Top Class This is a property that delivers on its 5 star promise.  Our room old world luxury but with a very modern finish. I really liked the Bvlgari products in the bathroom. It was a very good size, particularly for New York standards.The concierge and reception staff epitomised professionalism. They did an excellent job arranging a special night for us. Hassan was particularly good. My boyfriend (now fiance!) planned to propose during our stay and, at his request, Hassan arranged Champagne, chocolates and strawberries in the room while we were out. Our favourtie music was playing on our return to the room along with a beautiful arrangement of petals.The next evening we asked for a cab to take us to a restaurant. Instead the hotel provided complimentary use of its Bently.My only small gripe was with breakfast. It is served in the hotel's BLT restaurant which can be accessed by the public via a side entrance. When we arrived to breakfast on Sunday morning it was extremely busy and we were asked if we had a reservation. We did not and we were told we would have to wait 10/15 minutes. I thought it was very unusual that guests of the hotel should require a breakfast reservation. Anyway, we only had to wait 5 minutes and breakfast was very good. This is just something to be aware of.Overall,the hotel delivered on everything I would expect of a 5 star establishment.

<Content>Robbed by the Ritz We sat down for a quick breakfast for 2 and the bill came to over $100. You may ask, what did you order??-2 cups of regular coffee ($10 each)-2 cups of OJ ($11 each AND not fresh)-1 bagel with cream chees/lox (~$30) -1 bowl of oatmeal (~$20)We felt absolutely sick after the meal, this was egregious, why would a hotel have a restaurant that overcharges guests during one of the worst economic downturns in history in NYC?!?We would NEVER return to this hotel because of our terrible experience at the restaurant. How short-sighted of the hotel to have such a restaurant and lose future hotel guests!PLEASE do not stay here, the hotel itself is about as good as a Sheraton, the rooms are non-descript and do not feel luxurious. The highlight of the room was the fact that it was clean.

<Content>delightful Had a wonderful stay here recently and completely fell in love with the atmosphere and location. I usually stay at the Four Seasons, and was worried I would be dissapointed in the room size and bathroom at the Ritz, but it couldn't have been better. While the ceilings are lower, and the rooms don't have that spectacular architectural feel of the FS, it is a wonderful alternative and offers a much more residential, cozy and warmer atmosphere. Just know that the rooms are quite small, but beautifully detailed. Low ceilings, and a huge armoire holding an outdated television overpowered my room a bit. (I was in a Park View Room. I also viewed a Deluxe Park View Suite, which had a plasma sitting on a console table in the living room, but walking into the suite and seeing the side of the TV is not the right solution) My room was exquisitely detailed with upholstered silk walls and thick mouldings, a truly lovely grey marble bath, and everything immaculately clean. A sublimely comfortable club chair, with a lamp and side table right where you need it make this the kind of hotel room you want to curl up and really live in. The park views are spectacular and you feel like you're staying in an elegant townhouse. The staff definitely works to achieve this friendly atmosphere, and they are clearly trying to be warmer and less rehearsed than Ritz employees have been in the past. Even though, I don't think it's necessary to shake hands with the doorman, who took off his white glove and extended his hand before I made it to the door from the car. Call me a germaphobe, but I think he could have made me feel just as welcome with a smile. Also, each employee gives you his or her name. It takes a little getting used to, and at first could strike some as fishing for tips, but it does enhance the warm almost family atmosphere. An odd detail was the housekeeping cart that was parked in the hallway each night. The first night I thought it was a mistake. But all 3 nights of my stay, there it was, parked within view of my door! Its a shame, because the hallways in the Ritz are probably the most attractive of any hotel in the city. Room service was fast and very good, but I did notice that unlike the FS, there was no felt padding underneath the table cloth, a minor detail, but this hotel is all about the details. Two pointers when booking a room: 1) Absolutely get park view. It is worth it, and you will not have the same experience if you don't. 2) The club is not a must, and the concept is different than other ritz hotels but there are some positives, more on that below.The club lounge itself is on the second floor next to the spa with a door you access with your room key. (you simply pay to add club access to any room)  For breakfast in the club, you have to take the elevator down practically to the lobby, so you feel like you need to get dressed up, in which case I'm going out to a restaraunt for a real breakfast. If you don't want to spend the extra money you could have a very nice experience here, and never miss it. Although I will say once inside, it is far more professional and elegant than other Ritz Club lounges. (servers in the lounge are most attentive, and constantly offer to replenish your drinks and snacks, whereas other Ritz lounges have become much more self serve). A very nice touch was the phone call from the club concierge the night before my departure, asking if I needed him to arrange an airport transfer or to print boarding passes. Again, its all in the details. Overall, a wonderful experience. I will definitely be back.

<Content>Perfect location, excellent service Stayed four nights at the Ritz Carlton (Central Park South) with my 12yo daughter.The location of the Hotel is terrific, at walking distance from 5th Avenue and the shopping area.As soon as we arrived we felt pampered and welcomed by all the personnel, from the doormen to the receptionists (theye even knew my daughter's name!).We had one dedicated person who showed us our room and all the Hotel facilities.Coming from a long flight from Europe we wanted to have room-service dinner.It has been fast, good and accurate.So was the breakfast the morning after.The concierges are a real treasure: they suggested us very very good restaurants for our dinners and have been a very good help for everything in NY.The SPA (products La Prairie) is simply luxurious.Only negative note: on our departure day we had a snack at the Hotel Bar and the service was extremely long....Overall this Hotel is a bit expensive, but service, quality of the room and personnel are so good...Would highly recommend it.

<Content>luxurious (as always) Stayed here for 2 nights - wonderful as always. Very luxurious hotel, great location (across the street from Central Park). Had a low floor room with a view of the Park - enjoyed watching the horse carriages  the people. Only had 1 night booked, but it was pouring rain when we returned after a Sat matinee, and decided to stay another night. When we got back to the hotel drenched, the doorman greeted us with dry towels, and even dried our umbrella! They were able to not only give us a room, but the same one we had the previous night, even though we had already checked out.All requests (room service, concierge, shoe polishing, etc) handled promptly and courtesly.The rooms are very comfortable - the beds  linens are great - loved the Fredric Frekai (sp?) toiletries.Can't say enough good - it's not cheap (it is NYC), but well worth it!

<Content>Superb in every way After a slightly shaky start in that our luggage was sent to another room, everything was perfect. We had a city view room with club access. I would absolutely recommend the Club Lounge - the concierges were outstanding - they even sorted out our plane tickets when are flight was cancelled. The food there is truly first class - my son particularly liked the chocolate fondue each night. The staff throughout are extremely friendly and approachable, but can be seen to be a little over the top (my son remarked that he thought they were a bit fake). The rooms are spacious and extremely comfortable, All in all, I would never stay anywhere else in NY

<Content>Fantastic! This hotel has a fantastic location, right on Central Park on West 59th Street at 6th Avenue (Avenue of the Americas). Every major designer store is within walking distance as is Bloomingdale's, Barney's, Bergdorf's and Saks. There is a complimentary Bentley Flying Spur with chaffeur at your free disposal to take you anywhere on the island of Manhattan you desire. The Front Desk team was fantastic upon arrival and checkout. The Concierge were extremely helpful in terms of transportation, theatre and dining. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was gorgeous as was the view of the park. The La Prarie Spa was fantastic for a massage and facial. The Club Lounge was a great place to relax after a fast paced day and night. The Star lounge was a beautiful bar . I am not too crazy about BLT Market as I think it is far too casual for the Upper West Side and the Ritz Carlton! It is also very pricey for breakfast!But I would go back in a heartbeat!

<Content>Excellent Service Excellent service from the moment my wife and I arrived. The entire staff was very attentive and accommodating. I booked through American Express Platinum Travel and was able to obtain upgrade upon request while checking in. The room was true Ritz Carlton decor. Marble bath with a separate water closet. Original room was shower only with a view of 6th Avenue.Traded back down for a separate shower and tub. Concierge was absolutely great. Abraham gave great suggestions for places to eat and party. He was able to get my wife and I on the list to get in a club called Room Service. He suggested Scalinatella and Remi for dinner (both Italian). Morimoto's on 10th Ave is definitely a must do if you like sushi and Seafood. Also if you like fish and chips A Salt and Battery in Greenwich Village is necessary. They were featured on Bobby Flay's Throwdown. He lost (so what does that tell you). True Brits - past the accents. This hotel is very convient to the subway and directly across the street from Central Park. Fifth Avenue is one block away - most of the shopping stores are within a four block radius. My wife had spa services at La Prairie and absolutely loved it. Her technician was Jaimie (guy). He was highly recommended by the Ritz. She had the 30 min. massage and the Luxe Moisture Indulgence and she raved about it. She said it was the best spa treatment she had ever had and my wife is very well traveled and has had numerous treatments here and abroad. The BLT restaurant was ok. It is very overpriced for what they serve. Having routine breakfasts and brunches at the Ritz Carlton in Buckhead (Atlanta) my expectations were high for this restaurant based on the location and reviews. It didn't overshadow the experience and service from the Ritz. If you are looking for consistency in wonderful service and attentiveness then you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Luxurious Stay at the Ritz Beautiful hotel overlooking Central Park. Staff were attentive and friendly and willing to accommodate our request fro early check-in. The room was tastefully decorated and very comfortable - it is nice to have a hotel room in NYC where you aren't tripping over yourself due to lack of space. Toiletries and amenities were luxurious and we enjoyed our stay. We have stayed in the Ritz in other cities where we were disappointed with the experience, but this stay felt like true Ritz hospitality.

<Content>Very Luxurious We booked this hotel for 7 nights through British Airways for a cost of around 拢2400 for 2 adults. Our room was very spacious - we had booked a standard room but I think we were probably given a larger than average room. There was a small lobby area to the room and the bathroom was perhaps the largest I've ever seen! Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, who were fairly consistently excellent (with the exception of one waitress in the Star Lounge who hurried everything and was quite rude). The hotel decor is tasteful, and the relativley small lobby and reception area gives the hotel a personal feel that other five star hotels often lack. My only real complaint is the exorbitant cost of food and drink if you eat in the hotel - other than that, our stay was almost faultless.

<Content>Better than the Ritz? Just returned from a quick 3 day stay at the Ritz Carlton Central Park, Celebrating my wife's 40th birthday and her first visit to NYC.Check in was quick and extremely efficient. We were greeted by name and offered a cold bottle of water, which was appreciated after a long cab ride. We arrived on the red eye from L.A. at around 9:45 and were immediately allowed to check in. Now that may not seem like much to some, but to us, it meant everything and got our trip started off right.The room was very clean and pretty much what one would expect from a Ritz property. This is NYC and one should not expect huge rooms, but it was large enough, spotless and well appointed. Having stayed at 5 star properties/resorts around the U.S. and abroad, they did a very nice job living up to the hype.The location is superb. Across the street from Central Park and in walking distance to just about everywhere as long as you are a walker. We walked to St. Patricks, Rockefeller Plaza and the theater district. Subway stations are within 2 blocks in every direction. There is a really nice Whole Foods Market 2-3 blocks to the west at Colombus Circle where you can pick up the fixings for a nice Central Park picnic lunch.For tour seekers, there is a Grayline bus stop (double decker)right across the street at Central Park So. as well as the Hansom Carriages. The concierge desk was very helpful with tour/admission tickets as well as some great dinner suggestions. We dined at Scalinatellas, a great Italian restaurant with impeccable service and food in a quaint location. We took a 5 minute cab ride and strolled back in about 15 minutes. Great call Abraham. We also dined at Del Frisco's Double Eaglr Steak House, again at the request of the Concierge and were not disappointed. Great atmosphere and a very friendly bar/server staff. Great steak, and very large portions. Definitely a wonderful experience. Again kudos the the RC Concierge staff. Again, at the advice of the concierge, we had a very nice breakfast at the BLT Market, located in the hotel. Great Service and delicious pancakes. I read these reviews and try to extract the pertinent information about the property in question, so as to make an informed decision when I travel and or stay at new locations. In turn, I try to write reviews which are also on point. Don't go to the Ritz if you are worried about spending a few extra dollars. We spent $75 on last minute dry cleaning and the service was fast, the clothes were well handled, pressed and cleaned. This is to be expected and I was appreciative of the service. Don't complain about the use of the Business Center, just ask questions first. It aint free, there is a fee. If you choose not to use it, DON'T.Lastly, we were extended a late check out until 2:00 PM and the Bell Desk held our luggage whicle we went to the most venerable of all locations in NYC, Yankee Stadium. Upon our return, we were offered the use of the roomy bathroom facilities tochange. I would have preferred the use of the shower facilities at the Spa, as most Four Seasons allow, but all in all, this was a great stay and my wife and I offer you much thanks and gratitude.Howard, L.A.

<Content>six towels, what for? Good location. Having had large company discount I still had to pay 500 USD pp for 1 night for a deluxe room. It was airy, nice bathroom (showerbath, toilet was separated). The bed was way too soft, the aircon was extremely noisy.In the business centre, 10-min internet costed 10 (!) USD. Ridiculously pricey. The staff was pushy even in US terms. 6 towels for a single placed in the bathroom, simply unnecessary. No breakfast befor 6am even no room service before that time.No amenities, no fruits, water, ect in the room that you would expect from such a hotel (like in Four Seasons).

<Content>Absolutely perfect experience at the Ritz I have a bad habit of not writing reviews when a hotel experience is perfect, but after referring to the Ritz Central Park in writing two other NY hotel reviews, I realized it's not fair to proclaim how wonderful the Ritz was. The service at every level was absolutely impeccable. Our room was beautiful and comfortable, with every amenity we could want (my only complaint would be the charge for Wi/Fi access; I really think that should come gratis nowadays). The room rate included use of the club floor, where refreshment is served all day long. Really handy, and nice to sit there with views to the park. I don't know how they manage that every single staff member knows your name, but they do. And they really make you feel welcome.

<Content>Trouble with Gift Certificates My family and friends for my 60th birthday (Feb. 2008) bought me 15 gift certificates to the Ritz Carlton for the expressed purpose of staying at this hotel. Check in May 24, 2008 and am told these are no longer elligible to used at this property.On the back of this cerificate the hotel is clearly identified as one of the participating hotels in the Ritz program. When they were purchased the only hotel they were intended to be used the Central PArk location. Now what good are they? I can return them and get the money back but what of the original intent? A birthday present lost.Ritx Carlton has lost my business and I want every one to know be careful when purchasing git certificates to this hotel.

<Content>Impeccable Service Having stayed at our share of five star hotels, we were not sure what to expect from the Ritz. We went to Cancun last year and stayed at the Tides. Having had our own personal butler, we did not know if we would find the same level of service here. We were not disappointed! Check in was seamless, we were personally shown to our room. The bottles of water provided with the turn down service was much appreciated. While, the hotel was plush - although our room was a bit small, but probably a good size by New York standards - what stood out was the level of service. The entire staff seemed sincerely gracious and helpful. In fact, my husband got sick from a meal that we had at a surrounding restaurant and the staff came to our rescue. After cleaning up the sink in the restroom, housekeeping would not even accept a gratuity. I had to practically shove the gratuity in her pocket! We utilized the limousine service a couple of times, and the car was always punctual and waiting for us. After checking out, we noticed that there had been a duplicate charge on our bill. When we called the Ritz, they had actually self-audited and corrected the charge themselves!! We were quite impressed with that level of attention to detail. Overall, it was the details that made our stay so memorable. We definitely plan on staying at this Ritz on our next trip to NYC.

<Content>Fantastic Stay at the Ritz We recently booked a 5 night stay at the Ritz Carlton Central Park through American Express FH  R progam. Although we did not receive an upgrade at check-in, we were notified of an upgrade the next morning to a lovely room overlooking Central Park. The bedding, bathroom amenities (Frederick Fekkai), towels and service were wonderful. The hotel is well situated for walking to Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue shopping. We loved walking through Central Park and enjoying some quiet time away from the hubbub of the city. Breakfasts were delicious and we were able to take advantage of our free lunch amenity by requesting a picnic lunch to go. Friendly doormen as well as efficient front desk and concierge service all added to our very pleasant stay at this lovely hotel.

<Content>Yes, it is Yes it is a lovely hotel, for New York. Stayed there during a short stay in New York in April 08. The location is difficult to beat... rooms are very comfortable and well equiped, overall a classy hotel. Paying a little more for a view of Central Park is worth it in my opinion.Receptionists and consierge helpful and simely.Have stayed on a prior visit at the St. Regis ... however I find the Ritz Carlton a more interesting place.Did not eat at the hotel

<Content>Anniversary Vacation To Remember! This hotel was fabulous! We went for our 10th Anniversary and were treated like royalty. The room was luxurious and the service was above and beyond all expectations. The extra cost was well worth it. The only down side is that we are so spoiled, we don't know if we would be satisfied staying anywhere else in NY!

<Content>Lives up to the Ritz name Have stayed here on a number of business trips with my husband. The service and location can't be beat. The rooms are a bit small, and some of them facing the inside shaft have no views whatsoever (keep those blinds closed!) but it is definitely a bastion of plush relaxation from the busy, crowded, smelly streets of New York. And the service is great, I look very young for my age but have never experienced anything but the friendliest and most respectful service from the staff.

<Content>The best in NYC The Ritz Carlton Central PS has been by far the very best experience I have had in NYC. My usband and I have been coming to NY once a year for a week for the past 10 years. We ahve tried many 5 star properties but none of then managed to achive such a wonderful combination of location, beautifull room, beautiful bathroom and service.We were upgraded to a prak view room on a low floor (8) but it was more than good enough.. we were just above the tree line but the sensation of space, day light and openness was wonderful.Although I am a travle agent and love to try new properties, I think I have found my home in NYC. If you are considering paying a little extra for the park view.. GO FOR IT !! It worth it.

<Content>The Only Place Stay in NY My husband took me to New York for my 40th BDay and we stayed at the Ritz Carlton, Central Park. This hotel is hands down the best hotel we have ever encountered. We are well traveled and stay in 4 or 5 star hotels consistently. We have stayed at many Ritz Carltons, but the Central Park location is simply outstanding. The hotel limo picked us up from the airport and upon arrival we were greeted by name and I was wished Happy Birthday from most of the staff. They upgraded our room, had complimentary champagne sent each evening, rose petals covered the bed and champagne and desserts at the restaurants we dined (compliments of the Ritz). The spa is to die for and I was given a bag full of products to take home. There was never a time that we were not greeted by name from the staff and throughout the weekend I was consistently asked if I was enjoying my birthday stay. The room was exceptionally clean and tended to and trust me that coming from me says a lot. The BLT market is fabulous and the hotel bar is fun and a good people watching place. I never wanted to leave and actually teared up when we did. Thanks to the Ritz Carlton Central Park, I was able to enjoy my 40th and feel like royalty. The pampering is never ending. We are already planning a trip back with our entire family and even though it is pricy, we would never stay anywhere else in NY. Go and enjoy!

<Content>Great location for shopping My husband and I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton for 4 days in December. It was a great location for shopping ! The hotel was very busy which meant the lobby bar was always full to bursting and it was difficult to get a table. We had a suite and it was lovely with an incredibly comfy bed and a big, well fitted bathroom. The spa was slightly disappointing - my massage was OK but the waiting area was very small and felt dated. This is definitely a hotel where the location counts for a lot and it's probably best to just use the hotel for sleeping - it's not a place to spend time in its own right.

<Content>Impressive as you expect for a Ritz We stayed in December for a business/pleasure trip. We traveled with our 3 year old daughter. The staff was incredibly nice and helpful, especially with her. For example, front lobby staff would watch her while I got stroller, etc ready to get out the door.The rooms do see a little dated for a Ritz, however it was very clean and the housekeeping service was great.We stayed in a room that allowed club level access that had a lot of free perks. I highly recommend booking a room with this access. There was food, drinks (water, soda, wine, tea, etc) out all day. This was great with having our 3 year old along. Very easy to stop in for snack on our way out or way in. Each night was tapas with sushi, cavier, etc. Very high end. We normally eat out when in NYC, however since we had our 3 year old we ate the majority of our meals here.The club access also has a conceirge. They were very helpful and knew our names from the first time we stopped in.I also become sick during the trip and the hotel doctor was fantastic. His office is very close or he will make a house call if you are too sick to travel to him. Fortunately, I had an ear infection so it was easy to stop by his office.We are planning on staying at the Ritz again this week and hope for the same wonderful, welcoming experience.On a side note, we stayed at the Peninsula on our prior trip and while as impressive, I did not find the staff as welcoming and our bill was not correct. It took over an hour to fix and there was another couple at the counter with the same problem.

<Content>Heaven in Central Park This was the most amazing hotel stay my husband and I could ever imagine. We stayed here using a Gracious Getaway certificate which includes an interior room (no view) and breakfast in the morning.We arrived at the hotel right at 3:00 p.m. and Wenny told us that our room was available, but that they would like to upgrade us to a room overlooking Central Park, complimentary. We had to wait about 15 minutes, so she found us a place in the swanky hotel bar. We drank $19 glasses of pinot noir, and were happily surprised when the hotel paid for them!! The hotel bar was unbelievable, and the staff was better than we could have expected, even for the Ritz. These people know how to treat guests and were just amazing.When we got up to our room on the 22nd floor, we had a breathtaking view of Central Park. The room was gorgeous. We took a bubble bath together in the oversized tub while listening to Tony Bennett Christmas, one of the cds available in the room. The American Breakfast in the morning was delicious. The meal came rolled in on a table and we enjoyed breakfast overlooking Central Park.This was a night to remember and I recommend this hotel above all others I've stayed in New York City.

<Content>Returning guest ...because it cant get better in NYC! Once again, top notch! Well worth the money (and its a lot!). Ensure you get a room as high up as possible - stunning views at dawn when with European jetlag you lie awake staring out across the trees! Only draw back is hotel lacks a fine dining 'option' and as such no glam breakfast room either. But space is limited in NYC and this hotel, as far as luxury  location go, is top!

<Content>5 stars I've stayed at many different Ritz Carlton's now, and I gotta say that I'm most impressed w/ the level of service from their Central Park Staff. My parents who have been married for 35 yrs were celebrating their anniversary this past weekend, and several staff members went out of their way to say a nice word of congratulations to them. I thought that was classy. The club level staff is absolutely stellar, clean rooms, etc... Will definately stay again.

<Content>Great Service - Small Hotel I agree with all of positive comments about this hotel in previous reviews. I love Ritz Carlton and do not intend to suggest that this location does not live up to Ritz standards. However, there are some important characteristics of this location that you must be aware of which may or may not be an issue for you.I kind of expect that the staff will bend over backwards for your every need at these prices, and they do. However, that doesn鈥檛 mean that they do so for free. They will get you whatever you want, whenever you want it, and charge you 4 times more than anywhere else. I have never appreciated the significance of extraordinary service at extraordinary prices. What impresses me is extraordinary service at moderate prices.I realize that complaining about cost when one is staying at a Ritz is silly, but this Ritz is more costly than any other Ritz I have stayed at. I just want to prepare anyone who is used to paying $15 for a cheeseburger at a typical Ritz for the sticker shock; they are $29 here.Also, I did NOT pay the premium for the Park View. I was in the Superior Room ($995/night) for 5 nights that was supposed to have a courtyard view. A courtyard view here means brick wall. I realize that this was my error, since I could have paid 50% more for a view. So if you don鈥檛 want to see a brick wall, pay for the view. Otherwise the rooms are beautiful, comfortable and the bathrooms are huge. I had no problems with noise on the 6th floor.But the prices and lack of view aren鈥檛 my real concerns. The reason I would not return to this hotel is that this hotel had virtually no common areas to speak of. The lobby and the adjacent lounge are small by any standards (about 40 chairs). Their is a small bar that is really a common corridor that leads to the hotel's only small restaurant. That's it. The grand tour will take you 3 minutes. It reminds me of a nicely appointed apartment building where there is a small lobby and elevators. So the only thing we used our room for was a home base. When we came in, we went straight to the elevator to our room. When we left, we walked straight outside. There is noting to see or do inside this hotel (they do have a spa and meeting rooms on other floors).The lack of common areas in the hotel may not be a factor for many of you. I realize that many travelers would say that they come to NYC to see the sights, not the hotel. But why can鈥檛 you have both? Particularly at these prices. I like my hotels to be destinations unto themselves. If it is raining (like it did one day during my stay) I want an oasis from the storm. Here, there was no place to sit because the chairs in the lounge were full of people escaping the rain.For example, The Plaza is right next door and is about 6 times the size of the Ritz and has large common areas and probably similar levels of service. I can make example after example of nearby hotels that are bigger, but I realize they are not Ritz Carltons. If I had it to do over, I would have stayed at the Marriott Marquis in Time Square, which I realize is a whole different experience in the middle of the hustle and bustle. The bottom line here is that the Ritz is not much of a destination as far as hotels go. The reason to stay here is the great service, Central Park across the street and its proximity to many great attractions.

<Content>Luxurious and pricey! We just got back from a fabulous stay at the Ritz Carlton. We were there for the weekend and pulled out all the stops for a 10 year anniversary celebration. My husband coordinated everything through the concierege who could not have been more helpful; cars to and from the airport, helicopter rides, roses, spa appointments, restaurant reservations, show tickets, etc. They were extremely helpful and most everthing exceeded our expectations, great seats for dinner and the show, amazing spa treatments, use of the hotel's Bentley, etc. When one of our actitivites didn't work out and my husband complained about having to take cabs to and from, only to find out it had been canceled, the concierge apologized and reimbursed my husband for everything (including the cabs) immediately and without a fuss.The Ritz was impressive: You are offered champagne and hors d'ouvres while checking in, the person who checks you in shows you to your room, they sent up a little anniversary present and also gave us one at the spa, there's a lovely turn down service, the staff knew our names, we needed to have some clothes pressed and they turned it around in a couple hours, etc., etc. It's right across the street from the carriage rides in Central Park, down the street from the Time Warner center and around the corner for FAO Schwartz, Barney's the rest of Fifth Avenue shopping. The park view deluxe view room we booked was big, traditional and nicely appointed with a huge bathroom. (Although for $1200 a night it would have been nice to have had two arm chairs.) The rooms look as though they were recently redone, ours had a very fresh feel to it. The staff was extremely courteous and accomodating. As I mentioned above, my husband coordinated all our activities through them. However, you are paying for service like this. When we got to our room for the first time, my husband, who is an appropriate, but not overly generous tipper, noted that he had already spent about $100 tips. (We had only been in New York for 2 hours!) (For the entire trip, and, admittedly we had thrown caution to the wind a little bit, we spent at least $500 on tips alone -- and we're not over tippers!!)I received the best massage of my like at the La Prairie spa and also enjoyed a very good facial.Room service is beyond the pale expensive. Breakfast for two was a jaw-dropping $200. Safe your money and have breakfast and the lovely BLT Market off the lobby.Despite being extremely expensive, we'd do it all again. It's a fabulous special occasion treat!

<Content>Exceptional As a part of a luxury two centre holiday [for our honeymoon] we booked the Rita Carlton via Virgin Holidays. Now we are not seasoned travellers though we do expect to receive a certain high grade service from 5* establishments. The hotel from the outisde looks unimposing when compared to the Plaza, however, it is well situated for Central Park and 5th/6th Aves. This is a smaller but no less luxury hotel which really excels in 1 to 1 customer service. The lobby areas are exquisite as is the lounge and the lifts up to the bedrooms. Upon our arrival we were warmly received and informed that we had been upgraded to a 'park view' room which was very nice. Our stay was for 4 nights and as the hotel is located right at the foot of CEntral Park this makes it an ideal 'base' from which to explore this great city. The room was luxurious and spacious with a superb bathroom. As you'd expect you do also get the added value of thick and comfortable bath robes and toiletries. The room benefited from a large TV, DVD and mini-bar though I would avoid this as the prices are just plane 'silly'! Being British, it is often the small touches that appeal and we especially liked the free shoe shining service and free newspaper [delivered to your door each AM]. The air con was effective and easy to control. The views across the park were outstanding.This IS a luxury hotel and the hotels facilities have prices to match but as you are centrally based in one of the busiest cities in the world, you will probably only spend a limited amount of time in the room. I think because of it relative small size, good location, and 'quirky' feel this will appeal to British tourists looking for something a little more sophisticated and not just a plain travel lodge type affair. The hotel lived up to our expectations.Enjoy!

<Content>Ultimate New York Hotel My wife and I spent an anniversary here last October, and the experience still resonates with me. We frequent many top hotels and high quality Inns around the world, but the New York Central Park Ritz is most definitely one of the best. Accommodations were wonderful, top notch. I love the security factor at the elevator with the electronic key card elevator access. It made me feel very secure in the Big Apple. Jake, the concierge, was fantastic in getting us reservations at the last minute to Daniel's on Broadway and Nobu, and we were treated very well at these fine establishments. it's evident that the concierge at this hotel has influential pull at the finest restaurants in New York.The location of the Central Park Ritz can't be beat. the view of the fall foliage from our hotel room was breathtaking. The hotel is only a short walk to all the shops on Madison Ave. High Tea service was wonderful. All in all, it was worth the price. Our room was about $750 p/night midweek, plus we tallied over $1K in incidentals, including the la Prier Spa on the premise.Wonderful stay! As k for a suite with views of Central Park!

<Content>Five Star Disappointment My husband and I love to travel and love the Ritz Carlton - we pay the premium for what is supposed to be five-star premium service. We had a wedding to attend in NY and we had looked forward to staying at the Ritz NY CP all year. On the first evening, Sat., we stayed in with the DND on the door - housekeeping respectfully left us alone, but left a card stating they had attempted turn down. So far, so good...The next day, Sunday, we again relaxed in our room all day with the DND and left for the wedding around 4 pm. We called housekeeping to tell them we would be leaving so they could take care of our room. We left around 4:10 and removed the DND. We returned to the hotel at 2 am AND THE ROOM HAD NOT BEEN CLEANED - no cleaning, no replacement towels or toiletries, no refreshment of the minibar, no turn down, nothing. Not even a card stating they had attempted to stop by. My husband called the night manager who was apologetic and offered to take fresh towels up to us. Since they had about 10 hours to do that, we declined.The next day, Monday, we complained to the assistant manager. Again, very pleasant and apologetic fellow. He stated that housekeeping had noted our DND sign. We said we had called AND removed the DND sign before we left the room around 4 pm. We understand that at a 5-star hotel, they won't enter your room with the sign on, so we are careful to remove it when we are away.He offered to upgrade us and/or give us a discount - we responded that we don't stay at the Ritz to save money, we go to the Ritz to be pampered and taken care of. That's the point. We left to go shopping and as is normal our room was cleaned. We then returned and readied ourselves to go out to dinner around 7:30 pm, removing the DND from our door before we left. We returned around midnight. Again - no turn down card. What we had was a voicemail (?!) stating that they had tried to give us turn down but that there was a DND on the door. Patently false. If they had bothered to simply walk by the room, they would have seen that.We have stayed at 6 Ritz Carlton hotels, of these - NY and New Orleans (we stayed in 2004) were the worst in terms of service. We were extremely disappointed that there was a complete and total breakdown in service and instead of making sure it did not happen again (or at all), we were blamed - You had a DND on the door - for their lack of attention. For 2 nights in a row, a simple walk down the hall would have revealed no DND sign on our door or, alternatively, accurate records by housekeeping noting that our room had not been cleaned/turned down.Since the Ritz is a chain, it has a responsibility to offer its guests consistently excellent service. Average or Ok service that we experienced at the Ritz, especially the Ritz NY, which one would rightfully expect to be a bit of a standard bearer, is unacceptable. Given the fact that NYC is full of luxury hotels we have other choices - we won't be returning to the Ritz NY. If you enjoy true luxury travel, we suggest you spend your money elsewhere while in NY. The Ritz NY CP simply is not worth the money.

<Content>Has spoiled me such that I have trouble staying in other hotels. I have stayed here during most of my visits to NYC since moving away from NYC in '04. I am a native of Brooklyn but have lived in Manhattan for 15 years prior to having to move to the midwest. I return as often as possible. Quite simply, I cannot stay in other hotels. My work takes me to other cities and despite trying to find the 1st choice or best hotel, I am always disappointed. The staff at Ritz-Carlton CPS is dedicated, responsible, courteous and attempt to anticipate needs often very successfully.The rooms are spacious (I always stay in Park View), well appointed, in outstanding condition and spotlessly clean. They actually do look like the pictures on the website.The food is very good for hotel food and during my most recent stay they were re-doing the restaurant but still served a full menu in the lobby lounge.The security is outstanding with security staff at the entrance and card entry to both the floor and room a guest is assigned to. The location is perfect for tourists and business travelers as it is centrally located and the staff at the door are very helpful in getting taxi's even at difficult times for catching a cab in NYC. Also, public transportation is nearby.The tea service is wonderful and I adore the clotted creme. A long time ago I developed a habit of requiring heaps of clotted creme whenever I have a creme tea. Something the Ritz was not initially used to providing but now understands what I mean by heaps. The server's for the most part do an excellent job hiding their surprise regarding how much clotted creme one can get on a scone. But they accommodate me and remember from visit to visit my special request for heaps.The spa is so peaceful and clean and relaxing. The services are very good. The staff is soothing. And Rachel. She is the most nurturing person I have ever met in a spa and I am a spa junkie. She is like a dotting mother while you are with her and she gives the best pedicure in the whole world. Plus advice not to let anyone else clip your toe nails because she knows no one can do them as well as she can and she is right. Don't miss it. I had to miss her once when she was out ill after she had a fall on the subway but really all I cared about was her well being and not because of the pedicure. She just brings out good will in others. Which again speaks to the special staff at Ritz Carlton CPS. Her pedicure, alas, will also spoil you for any other pedicure because hers is the absolute best.Check-in and out is a breeze. I have never had problems. Special room requests have been met whenever possible and when they weren't the staff tried to make it up for it in some manner.The concierge staff will do anything possible for you. And no matter what celebrity is staying there (and there is usually some celebrity) you will only know it if you happen to see the celebrity entering or exiting or if there is a crowd outside the hotel waiting for a glimpse. But everyone is treated like a celebrity or more accurately all guests are treated the same. I always feel pampered beyond belief. The staff make me feel special. However, I am impressed that they do treat everyone alike.Room service is adequate. The food is good and really the only problem is that the food is luke warm by the time it gets served. But the presentation is lovely and they do not make mistakes with the order. The tray or table is collected within minutes of calling them. I have never seen a tray just set outside any guest room waiting to be picked up.Most importantly, I was concerned that in the few years I have been staying at this hotel things would change now that Marriott is the owner. However, not a thing has changed and I hope that Marriott continues to attract the outstanding staff at the Ritz Carlton CPS. Marriott is lucky to have the dedicated professionals they have attracted. It is truly a special hotel. A destination in and of itself in a city with plenty of competition for destinations.

<Content>Loved!!!!! Ritz Carlton Central Park My 2 best friends and I stayed here for 4 nights in July. We really love this place! Upon check in we were greeted by Ender who is fabulous. We then were escorted to the Club lounge as our room wasn't ready. We frequented the lounge several times during our stay and always loved the services of Kahn, he's so attentive and helpful. At the door we would always get a good morning form Felix, and an umbrella when it rained. We loved the concierge George, who helped us out on rainy days!The rooms were awesome and of course the bathrooms were to die for.Upon our departure, the club lounge fixed us a to go box to eat lunch at the airport.I highly recommend this marvelous hotel.

<Content>A very special experience-cannot wait to return!! What an exceptional stay this was. I had a terrible experience with one Ritz Carlton, and a disappointing experience with another one. I figured either three strikes and you're out or the third time is the charm. I am glad to say this was absolute charm from start to finish! This is a gorgeous hotel, and unlike some other reviewers, no one in the lobby seemed to care that I was dressed in sweats when I arrived. In fact, despite the fact that there was a mix-up (not their fault) with my reservation, they promptly accommodated me with a park-view room at 11am. A delightful surprise. Similarly, when I was heading out to dinner (around 5:30 on a Saturday night) and asked the bellman for the use of the hotel's Bentley, he promptly called the driver over and he drove me right to my restaurant. No waiting, no hassle, nice conversation, and a wonderfully comfortable ride!Shannon and Rosa at the front desk are lovely. They could not have made my arrival any nicer. Shannon escorted me upstairs, stopping along the way to show me the spa and the club lounge. It was wonderful. The room itself was beautiful, and huge! I absolutely loved every aspect of it. Others have mentioned the comfortable beds and Fekkai bath products. I concur. . .they are all wonderful. The slippers actually fit--a nice change of pace!! I returned to my room after lunch and an afternoon of shopping to find a cd in my room from the show I had seen the night before. With it was a note to please enjoy the cd as a gift from the hotel and a reminder of my trip to the city. It's that extra touch that makes the difference. Similarly, I mentioned to the concierge in the club lounge that I really wanted to know how the last Harry Potter book ended (I was in town the weekend it released), and he promptly produced one for me to read while I was there. Talk about resourceful!!I also took advantage of the La Prairie day spa, at which they promptly accommodated me with a same-day appointment. My facial with Mary was exceptional, and the reception staff were outstanding.Overall, although expensive, I think this hotel is worth every penny. I am definitely looking forward to the time when they reopen their restaurant, and cannot wait for my return trip next year!!thanks for a wonderful weekend in the park! I will most certainly be back!

<Content>Certainly one of the best! We stayed in the Ritz-Carlton for our wedding anniversary with some special requests. Although the hotel could not guarantee these requests on beforehand (like room 2214, give it a try!), we discovered upon arrival they had made some special preparations (like champagne in the room and a very friendly and personal card) and granted all of our wishes. Service was excellent throughout our stay - from doorman to reception to room service. This is really a top hotel and certainly one of the best we visited so far world wide. Enjoy the wonderful view from the upper floors!

<Content>Other Ritz properties can learn from this one. Past Ritz's I used were Amelia Island, SanFran, and Palm Beach and to date, the Ritz has been good, but NOT Four Seasons quality. The Ritz Central Park however is a pleasant surprise and management at other Ritz's would do themselves good to visit this place. ************************************ *PRE-ARRIVAL: NO problems on the phone and concierge was fine reserving a sedan from Penn Station. *LOCATION: Took 25 mins from Penn Station, and it's right on Central Park. Close to Times Square and Broadway in a more subdued part of town. *CHECK-IN: GREAT. Wonderful greetings and bags are taken within 60 seconds. Front desk was expecting us by name. They had suites and wouldn't upgrade me, but all was well and they escorted us to the room. *LOBBY: Lovely, typical Ritz. Lovely decor, floral arrangements, lounge area and kind of a sanctuary in NYC. *ROOM: Park View room. 450 square feet, and the pic on their website is very accurate. Very comfortable bed, typical high thread count sheets and good pillows. Surprisingly the air conditioning was almost of proper strength for IMO, you should be able to sleep comfortably with a blanket. There was decent lighting in the room and the view of Central Pk was lovely. I suggest not being lower than 11th floor for this. Nice marble bathroom with upscale toiletries, robes, and seperate shower. The water pressure was LOW and erratic throughout a shower. Sometimes I think hotels are using the recent enviro-fashion to skimp. Sure we can make adjustments, but decent water pressure shouldn't be outlawed either. *SERVICE: Everyone was friendly and great. Phones, room service, concierge. The concierge IS helpful and goes beyond merely making you a reservation, or looking things up in Zagat that you already know. *HOUSEKEEPING: No problems. Just what you'd expect at a Ritz. *ROOM SERVICE: We ordered it once and the delivery was prompt, friendly, accurate, and warm. Food was good. *DINING: We ate in the lounge which doubled as restaurant as they remodel. I'm a comfort-food guy and SURPRISINGLY, the food was marvelous. 3 mini burgers were great, fries were hot and crisp, service was perfect. Next table ordered a type of garlic pasta and just from the smell I could tell it was well prepared. *WORKOUT: I forgot to use this as I usually do. But I'm sure it's nice. The burgers sure were :) Enjoy, and safe travels to all of you.

<Content>Great but.... We stayed here before our wedding for a long-weekend May 2007.This is a strange one. Yes it a top-notch highly sophisticated, high-brow establishment, yes the staff are very professional, yes the rooms are amazing with beautifull furnishings, marble floors and telescopes so you can bird watch into Central Park. However for us there was something missing, the feeling that we could relax.Not the fault of the hotel itself but i have never felt quite so threatened as when we entered the lobby of the Ritz Carlton, dressed in tracksuits after 23 hours of travel to be greeted by the looks of other guests that shall we say were not exactly welcoming. That left a lasting impression that when combined with the general atmosphere of the place meant we did not feel like we were able to relax.Yes the rooms are spotless with due attention to small details, the bathrooms are particulalry impressive with marble flooring and gold decor, yes the staff remember your name,smile and tell you the weather-forecast for the day as you leave in the morning but how sincere it all is and how long it lasts depends on how much money they think you'll spend.We were too afraid to eat in the hotel given some of the other guests but i will say our request to have breakfast in bed on our last night was left hanging on our door even though a newspaper had been delivered and the sign would have been clearly visible. It 's about $37 dollars for a Brandy and coke from your mini-bar so bring lots of cash folks.And no review would be complete without pointing out the views over Central Park, and the relative peace and quiet you get staying here as opposed to the many more centrally located hotels elsewhere around Times Square and the like.To conclude come here if you want to impress and put on a show of materialism and wealth, say for a wedding anniversary . If you just want to chill out and need a base to explore what is a truely amazing city then save some cash and set-down elsewhere.

<Content>Out of this World Our daughter gave us an elegant retreat to any Ritz, we picked the Central Park location. Now, we are spoiled when in NYC.The service goes beyond any New York properties, we have ever stayed in. We had access to the Club lounge, the food was so good, we didn't want to miss any presentations. The conciergeintroduces you to the Club, on the way to your room. When we entered the first time, it was quite impressive when they called us by our names. We happened to mention we were in the city for Mary Poppins, when we came back into our room, the same concierge had the soundtrack playing, and told us to take it home, as a memento of our stay there. Again, quite impressive. The room was incredibly clean. The mattress was very comfortable, best of any hotel. Everyone speaks to you, and asks about your stay. My hair was the best ever, even in the humidity, due to the Frederic Fekkai toiletries. My stay there in NYC made me feel like a queen! I cannot wait to return!

<Content>Missed it by "very much" I paid $895 for a standard room on the third floor looking at 7th Ave. I understood that from the reservationist, so I wasn't surprised or dissappointed. Being in the hotel business, I am not use to spending money to stay at hotels, but I figured it's The Ritz and I didn't have a connection. The arrival experience was fine, but it was very very in my face. I was out of breath by the time I got to my room. It was all down hill from there. There was a light out in the bathroom (no big deal) and it took 4 times to get it fixed (big deal) and it didn't get fixed until I was checking out. It was the main light so I couldn't see when I needed to shave and that was a problem because I cut myself and bleed on my only white shirt. There was three inches of dust on the picture frames over the bed. There was chipped paint on my chair and chipped paint all over the walls. I only had two pillows in the entire room and they were horrible. The bed wasn't even close to The Algonquin Bed or The W bed. The sheets weren't even close either. The service in the lobby was flat and I had to get up to get the waitresses attention. It took 45 minutes for me to get an appetizer and when I received it, it was terrible. Every time I walked in I heard the bellmen and doormen speaking about their personnal lifes. One person is having problems with his wife and the other had chicken soup for lunch. I don't usually care about this kind of stuff, but I was there to review what it's like to stay at the best hotel in NYC, it wasn't good. I stayed in The Ritz in Orlando and it was amazing. Great service when you needed it and when you didn't they were gone. The cleaniness of the rooms was amazing--favoriate hotel in the world.The Ritz in NY is not worth the money--trust me. There are many great boutique hotels in NY that are half the money. Really wanted this to be a great review. Sorry.

<Content>Perfect Stay! I have stayed at many Ritz Carlton Hotels, and this is the nicest one by far. My husband and I took our two sons, 13 and 9, here for Spring Break. The location is fantastic- right at Central Park's ice rink, a block from 5th Avenue shopping, close to Broadway...Our suite was not ready when we arrived. The front desk staff assured us it would be ready in 20 minutes and offered all 4 of us a complimentary lunch in the lounge. The food was delicious, a harpist was playing, and we enjoyed relaxing in the beautiful room.Our room was ready as promised by the time we finished our lunch.We stayed in a Deluxe Park View Suite. It was very pricey but absolutely worth it. The suite was impeccably clean and our housekeping service was perfect. My husband asked for a few extra shampoo bottles, and she left over 15 extra bottles for him! A nice plate of cookies and drinks were sent to our boys compliments of the manager.The view of Central Park was mesmerizing. We could even see the ice skaters! It had 2 large, fabulous marble bathrooms. The bed was the most comfortable that I have ever slept in. The room actually reminded me more of an apartment than a hotel room.Same with the feeling of the entire hotel. We felt like it was our home. The Club Lounge is a must. Six different food presentations daily-of the highest quality. The concierge was fabulous here!The hotel has its own Bentley that will drive you to a nearby restaurant or Broadway show. We were lucky to ride in it twice- compliments of the hotel! We felt like royalty.I don't have a single complaint about this hotel. I can't wait to stay here again. It is expensive, but worth it!

<Content>Best hotel service I've ever experienced Organised a last-minute stay here with husband and our five year old, during THAT snowy week in Manhattan. From the moment we stepped out of the cab, someone, somehow, knew who we were and we were warmly and kindly greeted . Within half an hour of arrival, a lovely team member knocked on the door with toys and box of chocolates for our daugher (it was Valentine's Day next day). Room and bathroom was extremely comfortable. well equipped and well presented. Surprisingly child-friendly hotel! Would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone with young children.

<Content>Superb! Small  I stayed here with my wife and three children (18,16,12yrs) for our anniversary. We got a great deal on an Avenue Suite which accomodated us all (including two bathrooms.) We stayed for 4 nights from Feb 18th-22nd 2007.First impressions: the hotel is very private. The lobby is small but opulent and the bar is awesome although we stayed at club level. Club level is definitely worth the $50 per day. You get six food presentations and drinks (the Hildon water is particularly nice.) The quality of the food is excellent and especially the desserts! There is a great conciege called Hatsumi - she is really cool and helpful.The rooms are great. And Fr茅d茅ric Fekkai toiletries are stocked as standard. The service is really excellent.We have frequented other Ritz-Carltons around the world. This one is definitely different. Much smaller and less ostentatious.Also the gym is well appointed.Overall, you will get what you expect from a five star hotel!They do go out of their way to accomodate you.

<Content>Fabulous Weekend We just returned from a weekend stay at the Ritz Carlton Central Park. The service we received was amazing. From the champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to the cd from the play we had seen that day, the guest services department went above and beyond. Our parkview room was superb. The room was comfortable and elegant and the Frederic Fekkai bath products were wonderful. It was great waking up to the view of central park and seeing the ice skaters on the rink. The horse and carriages were lined up outside the hotel (across the street). It was a truly special scene. I highly recommend this hotel for a romantic weekend or any time. I can't wait to go back!

<Content>TOP NOTCH!! I can not say enough about this hotel. I have stayed at many other Ritz Carltons but this one, by far, surpassed them all. The level of service is beyond outstanding. The staff, from bellman to front desk, to guest relations, could not do enough. As soon as myself and my 8 year old daughter checked in everyone greeeted us by name. I don't know how they all knew us literally right after check in, but they did. We booked a deluxe rm with the American Girl VIP package. (If you have a daughter you probably know American Girl). There are a bunch of added amenities with this package. Guest Relations called me 3 days ahead of time to find out what kinds of things my daughter likes. When we got to our room (which by the way they had upgraded us to a large suite) there was all kinds of presents waiting there for my daughter. She was so happy! The room was immaculate! Room service was prompt, accurate, hot and delicious. It is worth every single penny!!!!

<Content>New York's finest hotel This is the best hotel in New York - over the years i have stayed in many for business and pleasure, but if you are spending your own money and want value and a lovely place to stay, this is the place.We had a park view room and waking up was a pleasure. indeed the curtains were never shut.What sets this hotel apart is the location and the extra amenities - the bar is one of the best in NY and the concierge can't help enough and it's all done unintrusively.

<Content>Too many mistake for a Ritz Carlton My wife and I just returned from a weekend stay at the Ritz Central Park. We requested and recieved a park view room on the 10th floor. The room was great and the view was worth the extra expense. At first we were impressed with the attentive staff and the overall ambience of the hotel. We requested tickets for a sold out show and the concierge came through albeit at a significant premium. The stay would have been prefect if not for three problems. First, the only belt I took was missing after the housekeeping staff cleaned the room. We looked everywhere but the belt never appeared. We certainly do not think it was stolen but feel that it was gathered up in the linens and mistakenly taken from the room. We reported this to the front desk and so far they have not found it. We requested dinner reservations at a new restaurant on the hotel's recommended list. The conciere desk printed out a confirmation which included an address for restaurant. Infortunatley, the address was incorrect and we did not realize it until our taxi had dropped us off and left. We finally made it to dinner 45 mintutes late and our table was gone. The next morning before leaving for the airport, I pointed out the problem to the concierge. While he was apologetic and expressed a desire to compensate us for the mistake, he did not offer to do anythihg. I would have thought he would have offered to take us to the airport in the hotel car. Finally at check out, a bar tab that was not our charge was on our bill. GIven the price of the room, (over $1000 a night) three significant mistakes in two days is not acceptable and not up to the standard of a Ritz Carlton.

<Content>Lovely Visit An absolutely lovely hotel. The only thing lacking was the view, but that was due to budgetary constraints. Simply out of curiosity I looked at a suite that overlooked the park, but the rack rate for that room had way too many zeros in it. However, if one has the means, I'd definitely recommend it. An incredible view from a room with beautiful millwork and all the comforts that made this midwestern kid wish, for just a moment, that he was Gordon Gekko so that he could enjoy such a room. This hotel truly made my stay in NYC sooo magnificent. We were originally staying at the Ritz in Battery Park, but didn't care for the location or hotel so we moved to Central Park. The staff was attentive, security is great, location works well for business, restaurants, entertainment, sightseeing and shopping. The only odd thing was the paparazzi constantly hanging around outside of the main entrance. I found them irritating, and I'm not even famous. The room was extremely comfortable, quiet, clean and traditional with a beautiful marble clad bathroom. I look forward to returning.

<Content>Nice trip to New York My wife and I took a trip without the kids and needed a great location - the Ritz Carlton delivered that. Very courteous and professional service from the front desk to the bar. Rooms were not huge but very well approinted, especially the bathrooms. The lobby was elegant. The beds were extremely comfortable to the point of encouraging you to oversleep. On the downside, the cable didn't work - maybe just a loose connection - we were so busy that we didn't realize it until the last morning when we were checking out. I would definitely return. The room was expensive at around $900/night but we visited other very well-known Manhattan hotels in the $600 range and felt cheated as they seemed worn. The other hotels had lobbies full of poorly dressed gawkers whereas the Ritz seemed to give you a more secluded feel which we enjoyed.

<Content>Tries at service but problems possibly inherent in building I initially checked in expecting the Ritz-Carlton service and experience especially since the New York Central Park branch has had a number of positive reviews.The staff were indeed very friendly, given New York City standards, and put me in a deluxe 9 series room due to my extended 3 week stay.However, by the 2nd night, rumbling/rattling sounds were vibrating through the room and disturbing my sleep intermittently. It worsens during the day. I immediately thought of the review of another guest about trains and called front desk for help. After 2 visits by engineers, I was told it was the elevator and moved to a 3 series room; but not before being misinformed by the front desk that the 3 series room had a larger wardrobe space and told to go to the wrong floor first and being embarassed by the guest already occupying the room who was in the midst of drying up after a shower. On talking to the night manager, who apologised for the misinformation but said he couldn't do much except for giving us a wheeled clothes rack in the room, I went to sleep somewhat soured in my experience but hoping to get some sleep. Unfortunately, I was awakened again by rumbling/rattling sounds the next day.I've resigned to sleeping with uncomfortable ear plugs but I'll NEVER stay in the Ritz-Carlton New York again. For the price you pay and the promise made by the chain, you'd expect more. This hotel is nowhere near the Ritz-Carlton standard of other hotels I've stayed in.A definite disappointment.

<Content>A disappointing stay We love the Ritz-Carlton hotels......we've stayed in Orlando twice this year, St Thomas and New York a few times. I'm starting to wonder if the Central Park location is either too busy or just don't care anymore.Last night we went to dinner...( we were out of our room by 5pm ) and returned at 9:30. When we walked into our room, we realized that turn down and towel service had not occured. It was very disappointing. We called the front desk and asked if they changed their policy on turn down service, they replied that they have till 10pm to complete that service. I'm not sure that answered our question and is not typical of Ritz-Carlton hotels. We then asked for towels in order to shower in the morning(there was only 2 upon our arrival)....after waiting over half and hour (we were getting tired and wanted to sleep) we called again and the front desk said she sent them up and she has no idea what happened. Does that sound like Ritz-Carlton to you? After a call back by the front desk a woman brought towels to our room and told us of her woes on how busy she is and they just couldn't get to our room tonight. I can get that kind of response at any hotel.....not at $700 a night.Needless to say, I was very disappopinted in the service. No one apologized or showed any remorse for inconviencing us at 10pm on a Saturday night. I'm used to a different Ritz-Carlton. It's too bad.

<Content>There is a subway train under this hotel! The Ritz Central park was nice but none of these reviews mention the fact that this hotel sits right atop a subway tunnel.Maybe I noticed it because we took a nap once we got into town around 1:00 PM. After hearing a constant rattle every 5 minutes and the room shake I had to call maintenance.Well, sure enough it was the subway. Not much you can do about that!! Not so bad at night but during the day... forget taking a nap!Also I agree with all who say this hotel is way to much buck for the bang. I am a travel agent and stayed on TA rate so my price was only a 1/4 of the $1000 rate these rooms command. If I'd have paid full price I would have felt incredibly ripped-off for the small rooms and sub-standard Ritz feel.Definitely save your money and avoid the premium on this one.

<Content>It's a Ritz experience! Flying from SF, my wife and I decided to do a stopover in NYC. We stepped it up and stayed at The RC at Central Park. The RC gives all the sensory one needs - great hotel with great service from the greeting to to the last 'come again and have a safe flight!'. She went shopping while I stayed in our lovely room relaxing and finishing up paperwork before the transatlantic flight to London. Walking outside of the RC and thinking Wow, I'm in NYC - which way do I want to explore???? Only in NYC!!!The room was super quiet. The only sound we heard at night was our air conditioner. We like our room super cold - on the 64 degreees side. The air conditioner thought we were crazy. It would stay around 67 all night long. Service was abit spotty in the beginning, took 1 hour to get my luggage up to our room. The RC was sold out the night before. After that, smooth sailing at the RC.

<Content>Loved the Ritz-Carlton New York, Central Park As a treat I took my Mum and Sister to New York for a long weekend. In my opinion this hotel cannot be faulted. It is in a perfect location just a few minutes walk from 5th Ave. The rooms are decorated to a really high standard (the bed is too comfortable!) and the bathroom is exceptional. The view from the room overlooking the park was great to wake up to every morning. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful especially Jenny on reception, Felix and Eric the barman. We did take advantage of the courtesy Bentley as suggested in another review. If you are going to New York and want something a bit special then stay here. I cannot wait to go again!!

<Content>Great Hotel............... I like Ritz Carlton hotels as well as Four Seasons hotels. The RC Central Park is probably one of the nicest RC properties I have visited which includes, CA, NO, FL, HI, DC, GA et al. The location is perfect. The service is excellent. I love Norman the bartender who is a super nice guy. Our room overlooked the park and had a great view. The room service, valet, housekeeping, doorman were all very nice. I have stayed here twice in the past year and look forward to returning again soon.

<Content>Loved the Ritz The Ritz at Central Park is in a great location--within walking distance to shopping and restaurants. Also, it is close to the subway to get around the city. The room was reasonably quiet (our room was on the 10th floor overlooking Central Park). The staff were wonderful and the room/bathroom were clean and spacious by NYC standards. The hotel had a complimentary bottle of champagne delivered to our room to celebrate our first year anniversary. Even though everything was expensive (we expected the cost), it was well worth it.

<Content>All About the Bentley I feel compelled to begin by confessing that I never liked the Ritz-Carlton portfolio. The rooms they show in their ad campaigns often remind me of my grandmother's condo in Boca, and the whole Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen slogan seems a little pretentious. It's almost like Madonna trying to fake a British accent.Despite my negative first impression, I decided to stay at the Ritz Central Park because of its rave reviews on this site as well as its outstanding location. Needless to say, with the rate that I was paying, I arrived with high expectations.The moment I got off the cab I realized that the location is indeed stellar. The lobby is intimate and the check-in process was flawless. Excellent service free of ladies and gentlemen attitudes. Elevator access to guestrooms require guestroom keys, which I think is an outstanding idea to ensure the safety of guests (especially single female travelers).Although I had a deluxe room that looks into the building's courtyard (i.e. mechanical space), my room was well appointed. The design scheme is more conservative/traditional than the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental, almost like a newer version of the Carlyle. The room is slightly smaller than the standard rooms at Four Seasons, though significantly larger than such Upper-East-Side gems as the Carlyle and the Mark. The four-fixture bathroom is modern and cozy, although I find it strange yet pleasurable that there are windows next to the toilet.Given my favorable review thus far, you may wonder what prompts me to award this hotel three stars rather than five stars. As the subject title suggests, it's All About the Bentley. My friend, who is a frequent guest of this property, reminded me on numerous occasions that I must use the hotel's house car. It is basically a Bentley that the hotel uses to take its guests around the midtown area free-of-charge. As the car service runs on a first-come-first-serve policy, I headed down to the lobby at 7:15 for my 8:00 dinner appointment 15 blocks away, and instructed one of the bellmen that I wanted to use the house car. The bellman responded by asking me to wait in the lounge. I asked how long would the wait be, and he answered 15 minutes.Two glasses of Sancerre and too many cashew nuts later, I became impatient. It's 7:45 and car-less. I walked out to see if everything is okay, just to witness a couple handing a bellman tips, and immediately directed to the Bentley. Strange, I thought. I approached the bellman and asked if there's another house car coming soon, and he said, No, this is the only one, it just came back. Interesting. Car left during the discussion. I asked, how long have those people waited, for I have waited for half an hour in the lounge.He said, You should have told me you wanted to use the car, otherwise I wouldn't give them the car. It turns out that those people were never in the line, but due to miscommunication on my part, I was overlooked. Needless to say, I was furious. I told one of the bellmen, I said, where is he now? Went to dinner, he said, you never told me, as if it's my fault. Okay. Is it because I didn't tip you? I asked. He said, No... I got myself a cab and left.The next afternoon, I had a business meeting and saw the Bentley parked in front of the hotel. The same bellman was there. I gave him tips and asked if this time I could use the car. I can be a jerk when provoked. Three seconds later I was in the car, which is really quite nice.Will I come back? Without the Bentley incident, maybe. With the Bentley? No way. Meanwhile I will return to the Four Seasons and the Carlyle, both of which don't blame their guests for staff miscommunication.

<Content>disappointing We needed transportation back to the hotel after the ballet and the best the hotel could do is a car for a minimum 2.5 hours at $95/hour. After paying $1200 for a suite, I thought they could have done better.

<Content>A truly special place. OK, so you pay through the nose to stay here, but does that matter if you get your money鈥檚 worth? Of course not, and as one who has stayed in a number of other top-end hotels (The Waldorf in New York, The Savoy in London) the Ritz-Carlton is the first place I鈥檝e ever been that has, without exception, failed to disappoint.My wife and I were staying here for 6 nights with our 4 month old daughter, and as it was our first time travelling as a 鈥榝amily鈥?we were just a little apprehensive. Having got only a slight reduction on the standard rate by contacting the hotel directly - $675 a night for a Park View Room 鈥?our expectations were pretty high. Check-in was quick and efficient and the room was beautiful, complete with the promised view of Central Park. The only slight down side was that we were only on the 9th floor, so the view was more of trees rather than the park itself.The following morning, 7.30am, upon flushing the toilet the bathroom flooded. Big time. Called reception, and a maintenance chap was with us in 3 minutes, followed by two other staff armed with mops. A manager followed shortly and we were offered the option to move rooms, which we took, and were moved up to a similar room on the 20th floor. Much better view, and they threw in complimentary breakfast in the room every morning of our stay as compensation (probably over $400 worth of breakfasts). They even refunded the tips we made to room service. OK, so it was a shame the first room had to flood, but these things happen, and the real test for a quality hotel is how they react to such problems. In the case of the Ritz-Carlton, it was handled perfectly, and we were more than happy with how we were dealt with.Other points of note? The bathrooms are great with wonderful showers, the bed provided some of the best nights sleep I鈥檝e ever had, the lobby bar is a shining example in understated elegance, and the level of service from every member of staff 鈥?from managers to maids and doormen 鈥?is exemplary. Just make sure you carry a pocket full of loose dollars for all that tipping!

<Content>V. Nice Stayed here for five nights. Romantic trip to experience New Year's. Park View Room expensive but view was great and worth it as a special treat. Great location to stay. Staff very friendly. Got breakfast one morning - unsurprisingly it cost an arm and a leg but surprisingly the quality of the food wasnt great.....

<Content>Not worth the money- My wife and two children stayed in a suite at the Ritz Carlton and I was not all that impressed. Rooms were nice, clean and well appointed. But dresser had broken drawer, hard to monitor temperature of rooms.Bathrooms were wonderful, clean and marble throughout. But rooms were small.Lobby was small and the bar area was nothing special.Didn't really care for the pro athletes wearing muscle shirts and adorned with bling using profanity. That was a huge turn off. If you are going to charge top shelf price- enforce the dress code!! I complained to the front desk about the language and the staff was apologetic but really not willing to do anything.Overall nice but I would not rush back there, lots of great hotels in NYC for less money and equal accomadations.

<Content>Great Anniversary! My husband and I stayed here on for our tenth anniversary. I must say that Marek, (not sure how to spell it) the hotel's driver was FABULOUS. He not only drove us to two venues, but also recommended some great places for cocktails before our anniversary dinner. Take advantage of the hotel's car if you can get it... very nice! The concierge was great getting reservations at the restaurant of our choice... La Bernardin. Champagne was sent to our room, along with fabulous chocolate-covered strawberries. The bar of the hotel was great, with a great mojito (at closing... sorry, bartender!) All around, a GREAT experience. Be prepared to pay dearly for everything... breakfast, coffee, the room, but for a special experience... it's worth it!

<Content>Wow! We came to this hotel for our wedding night - the staff pulled out all the stops for us and were amazed at the high standards of service and attention to detail.The hotel is very expensive but worth it. We stayed in room 2214 on the 22nd floor and were lucky enough to have the most spectacular view out over Central Park - it was breathtaking. If you can, take afternoon tea in the Star Lounge - the service was great, and the surroundings are beautiful.The hotel sent champagne and strawberries to our room and even made us the most fantastic wedding cake which was a complete surprise - we couldn't have asked for more. The great thing about this hotel, is that the staff here made a huge fuss over us knowing that it was such a special occasion, and paid attention to every detail. We lost count of how many of the hotel management came to congratulate us - it was fantastic and we felt like royalty. If you can, stay here.

<Content>Quick Weekend in NYC It was a busy weekend in NYC and all the hip hotels in Lower Manhattan were booked. Luckily, I was able to secure a Deluxe King room (had to settle for the 3rd floor). The rooms are incredibly spacious by New York standards and the bathrooms are over the top! Frederick Fekkai products, great finishes. The bed and linens are fabulous!The Lobby is tiny, but the location cannot be beat!Highly recommend staying if you want Central Park location.Classic Ritz Carlton service!Superb!!!

<Content>Nice, but... Overall:Very nice hotel as expected. Fairly clean, although there were some flies in the club lounge. There were several minor issues that most people would probably overlook. I would not go back because I felt the Pierre was a much better hotel overall.Room:Deluxe King was well decorated and had good amenities. There was only one regular chair, which made In-Room Dining a bit difficult. Typical, large Ritz bathroom which is about half the size of the actual guestroom. My wife and I did not find the bed and pillows to be comfortable.Club Lounge:Very inviting atmosphere but not much variety in food. Food quality was not too great either.In-Room Dining:Food came very quickly. The one time it was delayed, I received a call telling me it would be another 5 minutes. However, it took over an hour and 2 phone calls to have them remove the table from the room (on 2 occasions). Food quality was average.

<Content>Spectacular! My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights in April; we got a club level room. The location was great - close to so many things and right on Central Park. The only disappointment was our view...of a brick wall - other than that it was wonderful! The room was beautifully decorated, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was large and covered in marble. The evening turn-down service with jazz music was a nice touch. The club lounge was great, it was very nice to sit in the lounge and enjoy the food and drinks while overlooking Central Park. I especially enjoyed the afternoon tea service. The club concierge was very helpful. The spa was wonderful too. The hotel staff was very pleasant and we were always greeted by name. To top it off, we stayed for free using our Mastercard rewards. We will definitely return to the Ritz on Central Park and look forward to it! We didn't know about the Maybach, we'll have to try that on our next visit! This was my husband's 1st visit to NYC and my 2nd - we loved it and we are already planning another trip!

<Content>Exceeded my high expectations We stayed in a Parkview room 22-25 April 2005 to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. This was to be a no-expense-spared blow-out. I was a little anxious that my high expectations might not be met - I needn't have been. The room was great, the staff friendly, welcoming and eager to please. I had read on the internet about the Bentley 'house car' available for guests and boldly asked the doorman if it was available to take us to the Empire State building. Not only did he call round the stretch Maybach mentioned by the previous reviewer (a truly astonishing car), but the concierge provided us with the hotel's VIP pass for the Empire State, which allowed us to jump all the queues. We were in and out in 20 minutes. The burger I had from room service one lazy afternoon was the best burger I've ever had (and I've had a few!). I now have 10 years to work out how I top this for our 20th anniversary. Any faults? Well, everything's expensive (food, cocktails) but then I expected that, and the quality justifies the high prices.

<Content>Loved The Ritz Me and my wife stayed at the Ritz Carlton Central Park on April 22nd and 23rd. Our experience there was wonderful. The employees of the hotel where friendly and helpful. For example, we asked the doorman to catch us a cab for dinner after being unsuceesful for less than a minute he called over the hotel limo to take us. The limo is a $400,000 Maybach mercedes Benz. Which we thought was going above and beyond great customer service. Im very selective when it comes to hotel and seldom pleased. My stay here was very refreshing. I've stayed at many five star hotel and I would say this Hotel ranks among the best. So enjoy you wont be disappointed.

<Content>It's all about service here Service is this hotels strong point. If your traveling here with children they appear to put you on the 5th floor in the back. No view, just the back of the other buildings around you, so bad you don't want to open the curtians. We traveled here with our friends and thier two children. I was not impressed with the location of our room. That would be the only negative thing I could say about the hotel. Everything else here was great. The attitude of the staff made you feel welcome. The food was very good. Many celebrities were staying at the hotel including Jennifer Anaston, Courtney Cox, Frasier (Kelsey Grammer?) Charles Barkley and so on. The location is great, just around the corner from 5th ave the shopping. Across the street from Central Park, one block away from the subway station, but you don't need that as the hotel car (450K Maeback) not sure that is correct, is available to drop you off. This is a true 5 star hotel. And I say that as we have recently had the misfortune of staying at a Sheraton dba Starwood hotel which claims to be a 5 star but really is a one star hotel. This is really nice hotel with great service, give it a try.

<Content>Ritz Carlton - average! I booked the Ritz Carlton to finish off a Queen Mary 2 cruise in style. Sadly during our 4 night, 5 day stay we were not impressed. (2nd to 6th April 2005) The staff were very young and seemed poorly trained. We had a park view suite (over 拢1,000GBP per night!). For example; every day we had to ask for towels; the mini bar was examined in minute detail whilst we were in the room. There were also other niggles regarding the standard of cleaning and the operation of the Club Lounge. I know this might sound like nit picking but at the cost and their reputation the experience should have been a lot better. We stay at top hotels and go on 'no expense spared' cruises and holidays with our two children aged 7 and 9. Disappointingly, this visit to the Ritz Carlton, Central Park, NYC was not up to the standard expected.

<Content>Perfectly Fine, Nothing Fantastic The five days I spent at the Ritz-Carlton Central park marked my first visit back to New York since I moved away from the city. I splurge when I travel... and am usually a Four Seasons addict, but the FS New York property leaves much to be desired, so I tried to find the most luxe hotel in NYC. After looking at this website, and the Ritz-Carlton website, I decided to stay at this hotel. I booked a Park-View room for $590 per night, through AmEx Platinum. Upon arrival, I was given Club Lounge access as an upgrade. The first room the receptionist escorted me to was unacceptable: dark, shabby (fringe torn off the curtains), and an ugly gold color that didn't suit my tastes. I didn't like the room, so she was kind enough to show me two others, one of which was perfectly lovely. The bellman kindly moved my luggage and the flowers and giftbasket which had been placed in the room before my arrival (however, they lost the cards that arrived with them, so I had no idea who they were from until someone said, Did you get the flowers???).Yes, the rooms are nice... but nothing to die for. (Sometimes I wonder what the homes of Tripadvisor users must look like since they're drooling over hotel room decor...) Small but elegantly furnished. Room service is a little better than average. The lobby and bar was happening every night, but the restaurant was EMPTY. The whole club lounge concept isn't my scene. Guest excited about FREE FOOD and drinks hovering around appetizer platters is disappointing. It is a lovely hotel, and the service is good. But, is this the best NYC has to offer? Is this as good as it gets? If so, I'm terribly disappointed. I imagined so much more. I think every hotel should aspire to be like the George V is Paris: absolutely flawless.

<Content>Why stay anywhere else? The Ritz was everything they speak it up to be... I got an incredible rate on it through my company, so it was hard to say no. We didn't have a faboulous club level room, but the room we did have was 100 times better than anything else I've stayed at in New York. The room was huge, bathroom fantastic, and service top notch. Its a great star-gazing place, too. In 2 days we saw 4 low key celebrities coming in and out while we just happened to be coming in and out.

<Content>Luxurious but not the best Ritz We stayed over the Easter Weekend for 3 nights. Had a club level room. No view but use of the club lounge and their own concierges. Great location opposite central park . Room luxurious but internal view...we paid $625 per night , but we did have two kids with us so had a room with 2 double beds so not too bad. Lobby was very small and not as spectacular as other Ritz we have stayed in but no doubt New York is short on space! Club Lounge a little disappointing . Concierges here were low key...helpful yes but not overly. Food presentations were pretty meagre (compared with Ritz Key Biscayne where we went after) eg no champage left out. It was there but you had to ask for it.Overall not my favourite Ritz and if, like us you are sight seeing all day you probably don't need to spend so much on a room. Would I go back to New York...yes! Would I stay at the Ritz...don't think so. We like luxury but will try somewhere else next time

<Content>Treated Like Royalty I proposed to my girlfriend at the Ritz Carlton a couple weeks ago. I booked a Park View Room and worked with the hotel staff to make the moment perfect. Katie in guest services and the rest of the staff exceeded my expectations. Our upgraded room had stunning views, we felt pampered - the hotel and staff made us feel like royalty. Having stayed in top hotels in Hawaii, Paris, Italy and across the US, my experience at the Ritz Carlton Central Park is without compare.

<Content>The best of everything We spent 3 fantastic days in New York at the Ritz. It was great to have a large room that is new in interior construction. Service was perfect from the front desk to the bellman checking out. Be sure to ask the concierge if the house car is available to take you to dinner or the theatre. Arriving in a Maybach will get you stares as if you are a celebrity.

<Content>VERY over rated I really can't see what all the fuss is about here.The rooms are OK (but small) and the rates are way too over-priced. The location is OK but everything else was just about average. - Still, if you've got money to burn, don't listen to a word!

<Content>Absolutely impeccable! Just spent three nights here with my mother and my daughter (age 8). It was my second stay at this hotel and I enjoyed it even more than last year. The location is wonderful. We walked to MoMA, American Girl Place, Barney's, the theatre and much more! The level of service is excellent and traveling with my daughter seemed to get me even BETTER service than without. Upon arrival one of the staff members gave my daughter a Lizzie Maguire DVD to watch in the room. Our first morning, on the way out the door, the doorman greeted my daughter by name! Our bellman was very grateful for his tips...everyone was fantastic! Our room was at the back of the hotel. We needed two double beds so we booked the lowest room category, which is the only way to GET 2 doubles. It was exquisite! And we still had three large windows, including one in the spacious bathroom. We had breakfast every morning at the hotel's restaurant, Atelier.Again, the service is unparalleled. Dinner at Atelier our last night was divine (and now prix fixe); the Master Sommelier was very kind. Although I love shopping and exploring downtown...I will never be able to stay anywhere but the Ritz Carlton on central Park - as long as I can afford it. It is absolutely a dream hotel! I'm hoping to take my daughter again this summer.

<Content>Just Perfect! My wife and I have just returned from a trip to NYC, we stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Central Park for five nights. Everything was perfect inculding the rooms, food concierge and service. Only small let down was the lack of gym/pool facilities.

<Content>Staff is Putting on the Ritz This property is fantastic! From the linens in the rooms to the way the lobby is decorated, you know you are in a deluxe environment.The restaurant, Atelier is outstanding. I was surprised to hear that the original chef has moved on. The menu remains inspired, the food is delicious and the service fantastic.The lobby bartenders are extremely attentive and informative about the wines they serve. Of course there is Norman, an institution at the Ritz, but there is also Celine. Celine is friendly and always professional. She takes a personal interest to ensure that her guests have a wonderful experience inbibing her creations. When a celebrity is there, she tactfully ensures that their privacy remains intact without insulting curious guests. She really is an asset to their organization. Overall, I feel that this Ritz property is NYC's finest hotel. Great location, great amenities and great staff make for a great experience.

<Content>They thought of everything Just about as perfect as you can get for a hotel. Although the rates are steeeeep, the service is impeccable as are the rooms. From the DVD players to the bath products to the pillows (THE best), the rooms are appointed perfectly. Room service was a tad dissappointing (especially given the price of a $22 caesar salad and a $14 bowl of soup), but everything else in the hotel is superb.

<Content>A perfect Hotel We spent 3 nights at the Ritz Carlton and have to say that it was the most beautiful and perfect hotel we have ever stayed in. We found all the staff very friendly, efficient and helpful and always courteous. We especially liked the juice and apples laid out for returning morning joggers every morning! The room was very spacious which is a real plus in New York. It was also very quiet - we had a back room - and although we didn't have a view of Central Park, we didn't feel at all disappointed. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in - I am now busy changing all my bedding - and the bathroom was simply luxurious. A hotel which could not be faulted and to be recommended to all.

<Content>Awesome Perfect location, great service, friendly and helpful staff, good concierge, well-equipped workout facility, good spa, beautiful views from parkview rooms, convenient and quick valet parking, more intimate size - not cheap, but worth every penny. The best all-around hotel we have visited in NYC.

<Content>First Rate Stayed for two nights and thought it was the best I've stayed in so far in NYC (much better than the run-down Plaza next door). Rooms were great, bathroom was huge, service was excellent. When you pay this much, this is what you should be getting. No complaints.

<Content>Wonderful stay! My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend and had THE MOST comfortable and splendid stay. The rooms were absolutely wonderful - BEST BEDS EVER with high quality sheets, GORGEOUS LARGE marble bathroom with huge tub, separate shower, and separate room for the toilet, high end toiletries, robes, slippers, DVD/CD player, stocked fridge, and impeccable service. We noticed the room was turned twice a day, once after we left in the morning and once in the evening. They replaced any towels and toiletries used throughout the day, remade the bed, left chocolates and fresh water by the bed every evening before we returned from dinner. The doormen were absolutely wonderful - opening the door, greeting us, and calling taxis for us. The concierge knew the area well and made dinner reservations for us. The fitness center was also fantastic! State of the art equipment with personal tvs, fresh fruit and ice cold evian water bottles on hand! I didn't indulge at the spa, but it definitely looked inviting and the staff was extremely courteous and over the top! If I wasn't moving to new york, I would definitely stay here all the time when visiting!! It is WORTH the price!

<Content>Best value in NYC Of all the luxury hotels I've stayed in NYC including the Peninsulas and the Four Seasons, the Ritz Carlton Central Park is the only hotel that I would look forward going back to. Great service, decent-sized rooms, nice bathrooms, and Frederic Fekkai shampoos and cleansers!! It's a rare find in NYC. I actually didn't think New York hotels were all that bad after the stay at this Ritz.

<Content>pure luxury We have stayed at some very fine hotels and this one definately falls into the category of 5 star. We stayed with our three very young children in a beautiful park view suite. It was magnificent. The staff could not do enough for us and greeted us each time we saw them. The bar and lounge area as well as the restaurant are excellent in every way. We LOVE this hotel and can't wait to go back for a weekend getaway. The best part was that they were so warm and hospitable towards our children.

<Content>FIRST CLASS Surpirsed my husband for a birthday-Easter~Yankess/White Sox opener weekend getaway in April. There is no finer hotel in New York City. The Ritz Carlton~Central Park has superior service, amenities and ambiance. Our Park View Room on the 19th floor overlooking Central Park was magical. From the concerige services, room decor, frette linens, club level amenities, Central Park location/view and overall luxury melted our hearts with pleasure. What a way to rekindle any marriage, at the Ritz, first class!

<Content>Elegant room, beautiful Central Park view We stayed here the last weekend of January and loved it. Our room, although on the small side, was gorgeously decorated and had the best view of any NYC hotel I've stayed in. There was even a telescope on the windowsill, and Central Park in the snow is breathtaking, especially after dark. Room service was amazing -- cocktails were delivered within 10 minutes of our placing the order, and came with a rose in a bud vase on the tray. Granted, the lobby public areas are confined, but everything is beautiful and elegant.

<Content>Simply the Best Having just spent the weekend at the Ritz Carlton Central Park we are hard pressed to think of ANY other luxury hotel which even comes close to offering the stellar service that this Ritz Carlton does. Our suite was enormous, immaculate and impeccably decorated. Having reserved a suite enabled us to take advantage of the exclusive Club Lounge which offered a delightful Breakfast, light Lunch, Afternoon Tea and After Dinner fare-all complimentary and of the highest quality. No request was too grand and the Concierge was even able to secure a last minute reservation at an exceptional restaurant- a normal impossibility in NYC. One gets the feeling that not only are the Staff well trained but also treated well and truly enjoy their jobs-nothing gratuitous about the service at any time-even after our car was delivered upon departure we were presented with 2 bottles of Evian for our trip home-it's those details that matter. (And for those who are not familiar with NYC the Ritz Carlton is in the perfect location-accross from Central Park on the Upper East Side-convenient to the theater district, 5th Avenue, Rockefeller Center, etc...)The Ritz Carlton Central Park does everything right-we will never stay anywhere else in New York again~

<Content>Not what it use to be... I stayed there once. It was good service but the food (when ordered room service ) came only luke warm and the lobby was tiny! Not worth the money, but it is ok, the views are great of central park, great location.
