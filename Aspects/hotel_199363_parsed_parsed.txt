<Content>outstanding bad experience With this hotel I had an outstanding bad experience while staying 5 nights: tacky hotel fittings, a congested water drain, a towel with smudges, a faulty garage mechanism for six days and no in-room Internet access which is a no go for business travelers.

<Content>Bright, clean, cheerful We booked this hotel through TravelSupermarket and were looking for the cheapest 3 star hotel we could find - expectations were not high at 55 euro a night.The location is great if you want to do West Berlin - the zoo is on your doorstep. The area is a little bit sleazy (sex museum, prostitution etc.) but not threatening and it is quite lively during the day. It is a terrible loction for nightlife (go further east).The lobby is quite stylish with a small bar and a very friendly reception. There is a computer there for free internet access as well as reliable wi-fi.The rooms are quite small but very clean and comfortable. Bathrooms are good too.This place is fab if you can get a bargain deal. It is not an art hotel. There are a few paintings and other pieces of art in the public areas and in the bedroom but they are little more exciting than in a travelodge.

<Content>Good product - would need better staff I book directly from the chain website and got a decent price for the period. Since I was travelling with my business partner, I booked a twin-bedded room. For those who are not familiar with that, it means that the rooms has two separate beds, each one for 1 person.On arrival, we have been allocated a room, nothing was said. We went up to the room and discovered the room only had one large bed and that there was no possibility at all to get two beds. Sometimes this is in fact two mattress with a zip between.I went down to the reception and got several consecutive bad answers. First one was twin room does not mean two beds, it means two persons. I answered that I had been working in hospitality + have been travelling over the world and that they were lying to me. 2nd answer: we never confirmed a twin room, it was just a preference. I had to switch on my laptop and got the confirmation where it was written twin room confirmed3rd answer: we have no twin room. That's it and you'll change tomorrow.Then I said that if I was her, I would first apologize for my mistake and that second I would check and check again every other reservation and find a solution. I would at least look embarassed. She was not at all and I was just bothering her. From there, I did ask to check name by name the next arrivals until we could find a single person having a twin room. While doing that, the guy next to me was alone and was checking in a twin room. I asked him to switch and he kindly accepted.The girl there was on duty, she refused to call a manager, she refused to call anyone else, she refused to book me a room in another hotel and she did not express any interest about my situation. She has no understanding of her guest needs and she lies.Otherwise the hotel was good, good value, good breakfast, good location, good room size for Berlin. The bar was okay.Bad point: wireless access only worked in the bar, which means we were about 12/15 people at same time in the abr, not for drinking but simply for working

<Content>Very acceptable - ticked all the boxes for the price charged I have just returned from a 3 night stay in the Art Hotel on kudamm, Berlin. I found the hotel to be very acceptable with helpful staff, comfortable / well fitted / clean rooms, attractive bar area and an unsupassed location for shops (KaDeWe - 5 mins walk / Kurfurstendamm - 30 second walk) Transport links (the Zoo' S bhan  bus terminal - 5 mins walk / U-Bhan -30 second walk / Tigel Aiport - 鈧?520 taxi / schonefeld - 鈧?0  35).This hotel provided me with eveything i needed for my stay as when i travel to locations around the world i do so to enjoy the destination, not the hotel (which so many people who have written reviews on this hotel seem to have done). my advice to these people is find a good hotel in their home town and go there - its cheaper and easier. This hotel IS NOT a 7* palace and it does not advertise itself as such. like wise (to the people who question the quality of the breakfast) it is not a michlin starred restaurant. With this in mind, if you want a quality breakfast (whilst not compromising on convenience too much) try the wintergarten (two streets away off the Kdam) - it is a specialist in providing breakfast (rather than hotel rooms) and does so at a similar price to the art hotel. The only justified problem that has been brought up in other reviews is the noise levels in the rooms to the front of the hotel. The walls do not seem to offer sufficient insulation to keep out tire noise which some (shallow sleeping) guests might find annoying. however, there are plenty of rooms which do not face the road and therefore do not suffer this problem. All in all. if you are looking for a reasonably priced, comfortable, clean hotel situated in a very good location; this is the one for you. However, if you want 7* luxury - the Berlin Ritz is also a very nice hotel.

<Content>Great hotel, clean  I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. The hotel was pretty nice and the room was very clean. The breakfast was also very good with a wide range of food - the only thing I missed at breakfast was Nutella :-) You can also leave your car in the parking garage and it costs about 12 EUR per day. Not too bad. The hotel is pretty close to the Ku'damm where you can find a lot of shopping opportunities (HM, Mango, etc.) and restaurants.You do not have Internet access in your room, but it is available and free in the lobby / at the bar. All in all I had a very nice and pleasant stay - many thanks also to the friendly staff. If you look for an affordable place to stay within the heart of Berlin, I really recommend you the Art'otel Kudamm!

<Content>Great location, bad night's sleep! I am perhaps not going to be totally objective in my review of this hotel since I stayed here having been bumped from my favourite Berlin hotel, the Palace...Pros: fantastic location just off the Ku-damm, great free WiFi connection in the lobby, friendly and efficient staffCons: rooms are small, bed uncomfortable, very noisy - make sure you take earplugs with youIn summary - this hotel offers a jazzed up version of an IBIS hotel and should only be considered if you are on a budget.

<Content>Not as Bad as Some of the Reviews Booked this hotel after friends recommended it on their last trip to Berlin. Then I read the reviews on this site and had thought about cancelling but felt we would try it.Hotel not so bad. We were told on check-in that their was additional charge for breakfast. Room was small but adequate.

<Content>A real disappointment Having stayed in the Budapest version of an Art'Otel a few years ago, I was looking forward to my stay in this hotel- and given that it was close to where I was working I thought that I had stumbled upon a gem.However, I'm disappointed to say that the reality did not match my expectations. First big shock is the lack of 'art' around the place... but then I am willing to admit that I'm not an art expert, so maybe I missed these treasures.The reception area is clean and tidy and the bar area certainly looks like it belongs in a design hotel. There is a decent wifi connection on the ground floor, but nothing once you venture to your room. A shame, as I was travelling on business and this was a major irritation.I booked a standard room. It was a nice size room, a jazzy / artsy carpet and a comfortable bed. The 70s lingered in the bathroom and the poor quality of the towels was another annoyance. Little touches such as toiletries (shampoo, soap etc) were replaced with tubs of generic soap attached to the wall... functional, but lacks that little sense of luxury that you want from a hotel.The biggest problem for me was the noise at night. A room on the front of the hotel is unbearable because of the noise from the nightclub opposite. I had to move rooms (and pay 鈧?0 for the 'upgrade') to the back of the building.I'm not an early riser, so perhaps this is a lesson to me, but the breakfast was atrocious. There were plenty of sausages floating in tepid water, but little else by way of hot food. When they did finally notice that the scrambled eggs had run out and refilled it, the hungry hoards descended, leaving a few scraps. I gave up all hope of having any eggs for breakfast at all. That said, the cheese selection was good and the bread rolls were still warm, which is a nice treat.I certainly won't be staying here again, and I would only recommend this hotel for those who need to be near KaDeWe, but can't afford the Swissotel on the corner. Given the multitude of other design hotels in Berlin (and plenty near the ku'damm already!) this is a truly mediocre hotel.

<Content>Okay for the price I booked this hotel for one night and would not recommend staying here unless you're on a budget. The room was around $100euro and the location is great - right on the KuDamm. However, the rooms are terrible - small, not the cleanest, and the beds aren't that comfortable.

<Content>Can there be worse hotels in Berlin? The location of this hotel is great if you like dull high street shopping and not much else. Arrival from the underground is through a subway that smells like a urinal. Not a good start.The hotel reception staff were helpful until we tried to check out. Then the accusations of eating and drinking from the mini-bar started as well as the 12 euros per day per person for the breakfast.We had been told the breakfast was free and refused to pay. The hotel manager called the police. Not a nice experience as you are about to leave a foreign city.The police never turned up and we were told 'you can go now.'My advice - don't book this one.

<Content>As artistic as a trip to an Ikea filled with pickpockets Mediocre room with a fine view of the dumpster. Decor chosen by someone who'd evidently spent a month locked up in Ikea. Low shower water pressure. Breakfast purportedly free, according to Priceline, and never posted as otherwise, but at checkout staff charged us 12 euro per person per day for scrambled eggs and wurst remnants.Other than that, a great hotel.

<Content>Tacky, but clean It's a matter of taste, of course, but I found the fabled art of this hotel to be nothing but tacky decor. Personally, I found it to be one of the least tasteful Berlin hotels I have stayed in.Decoration aside, my room was very clean and large, the staff was very nice and the breakfast was amazing.My main problem was that my room faced the very noisy Joachimstalerstrasse - even with the windows closed, the noise was very bad, also at night. The ventilation system in the bathroom drived me nuts - an hour after you had been to the bathroom, it would still make a very loud humming noise like a vacuum cleaner.Can't say anything about the price, as I was invited to stay there - the neighbourhood is a matter of taste as well: If you want the most garish and touristy side of Berlin, you have come to the right place. If cozy and laid back is your thing, stay in the area around Oranienburger Strasse instead.

<Content>Sorat Art'otel Was a bit freaked out by some of the earlier reviews, but it was one of the few hotels available when I was in Berlin and it was across the street from where I needed to be, so thought I would try it out.I was pleasantly surprised, especially comparing it to the Ambassador Hotel (another Sorat property), where I stayed the first two nights.I thought the decor was interesting, the room was clean and spacious, and the staff friendly. There was a great breakfast in the morning and it was nice to sit on the terrace with a glass of wine at night.The biggest drawback was that there is only internet access in the lobby and bar...however, it was free, so I just took my laptop down to the bar terrace and hung out there.I would definitely stay there again!

<Content>I should have stayed somewhere else. This hotel has a really convenient location. The front desk isn't very helpful, there is no bell service, and the bathroom could use a deep cleaning. When I checked in, the front desk told me I had one of the nicest rooms in the hotel. I can't imagine how awful the other rooms must have been if I the room I stayed in was considered nice. Luckily I was only in the that hotel for two nights. I really saw alot of Berlin because I hated staying in that hotel. I should have looked into staying at the Swisshotel just down the street.

<Content>A cheesy hotel surrounding by great ones We stayed at the Sorat Hotel and we were very disappointed. It is overpriced for what you pay. There is no bell service, the showers and bathrooms reminded me of high school showers. The only plus was its location, located near a lot of attraction and surrounded by great 5 star hotels.

<Content>Great location for shopping and going to the zoo but... I recently visited Berlin and stayed at three hotels, The Grand Hyatt, The Radisson and this hotel. This hotel was the least expensive, clean (even the towels are laid out on the bed for your inspection) and with walking distance of a very nice restaurant called Restaurant Dressler. Great for dinner for around $50.00. It doesn't need more business because of it's location. I overheard the staff turn down a visitor who came off the street. Booked up. Since the hotel is rather small, it has free computer access in the lobby next to the front desk instead of a doorman or consierge. I always find unfamiliar computers to be a pain and this one was no exception. Hard to use.The breakfast room was sunny and well stocked. The highlight of my stay. The lowlight was the accidentally activating the Adult/Movie channel thattacked on a 9.90 Euro charge to my bill for six minutes of time that they said I was watching this channel. Be very careful with that remote control.The staff never seemed to smile and I think the reason is that this TV system forces them to argue with customers like me. Stay at the Swissotel nearby and pay the extra money if you want to stay in this area of Berlin. The big department store is a few blocks away. Airport transportation is nearby.

<Content>Chic? Discreet?? Avant-Garde??? Chic? Discreet?? Avant-garde??? More like cheesy, tacky and worst of all -- dirty. I selected Sorat Art聮otel as part of a 3-night package based on the Frommer's review. We moved to another hotel at additional expense after the first night. The d茅cor might have been avant-garde 5 to 7 years ago, but it only reminded me of bad college student art now. The rooms are tiny and there was a persistent sewer smell in the bathroom. The street noise was intense despite being on the sixth floor. The service was non-existent and the staff was clueless. Frommer's needs to get back out there -- the very fact that this place is even recommended calls into question Frommer's reputation and trustworthiness.
