<Content>Great Location! We stayed at Hotel Milano the night before cruising on the Carnival Liberty. This hotel is right in the heart of San Juan and only about 5 blocks or so from the port. You have easy access to food and everything else in the city. They were also very reasonably priced compared to the other hotels in the area. It is a very basic hotel and if you are looking for fancy this is not it. Its great for one night. You also want to make sure you get a room in the front. There is a club next to the hotel and you can hear the music from it in the rooms in the back. Other than that great stay. We had the continental breakfast the next morning which was only $6.00 a piece. There is also a Mcdonalds and Burger King if you dont want that. There is a great Spanish food resteraunt called Raizes a few blocks away where the food is incredible.

<Content>Small and Intimate. Great Location! We stayed at Hotel Milano the day prior to our cruise. The definite pluses were the location and the friendliness of the staff. At check out time, they would store your bags which gave us time to tour the town without worrying about what to do with our bags. Even at the end of our stay, the manager loaded our luggage onto the cab for us. The rooms were definitely small and vary amongst other rooms. We ended up with a corner room which was significantly smaller but the same price as the other larger rooms our friends had. I was able to note this to management and they gave me a reduction in the price. In addition, do ask for a room in the middle of the hotel and not an outside room. It was very noisy during the middle of the night with all the bars close by. Overall for a one night stay it was very nice because everything was within walking distance. The only area that wasn't close by were the casinos which you would need to take a short cab ride to.

<Content>Good location, clean, good value for money After finding the recommendations from Tripadvisor, we booked Milnao for two night preceeding outr cruise. Well, we missed our connecting flight at NY and ended up staying only one night at the Hotel Milano. However, the owner promised one free night for us the next time we go there as we did not use the other night now and cancelled it only at the very same day. So gotta go back some day...Hotel itself is well located,, in the middle of the old San Juan, which was the main reason for us choosing it. It is very good value for money - we had front double/double room for some $140 a night. They have ok breakfast, $5 pp. Hotel is very clean and service is excellent.Noise from the street was bit loud as it was weekend, Reserve earplugs.

<Content>perfect location and nice overall Hotel Milano is perfectly located in san juan, in the middle of the clubs, nice restaurants, and surrounded by the colorful colonial houses.It was not too noisy when we stayed there, although the clubs are very close, so I guess that during high season you can't avoid some noise. We were in a queen room, clean and comfortable, with a small fridge -only missing the coffee maker-.The owner has put framed poems on the walls, and I must say he keeps the hotel with good taste.

<Content>Perfect Location! We stayed at the Hotel Milano after reading the reviews in Trip Advisor, and we were extremely pleased. We arrived after a weeks cruise on a Sunday before noon, and the staff were very gracious, checking our luggage until rooms were available. We set off from the hotel to explore Old San Juan, and found it was pefectly located to see the old city. After exploring the streets, doing some shopping, eating lunch and touring the Fort, we returned to the hotel to check in and take a nap. Our room was located on the 4th floor, and the elevator was more that adequate to take us and all our luggage upstairs. Our room had no regular windows, just glass block windows located high up on the wall from which we couldn't look through. No matter, this hotel is clean, the bed and bathroom were comfortable and pretty, (loved the cut-linen shower curtain), the fridge was big enough to hold plenty of wine, etc. We heard no noise from the street or the rest of the hotel. The front desk staff were especially helpful, and advised us about cabs etc. for our early morning flight. It did take less than 5 minutes for the taxi to arrive in the morning, as they said it would. This hotel is very reminiscent of European hotels we have visited, (however the rooms at the Milano were larger than many European hotels) and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking an excellent value in Old San Juan.

<Content>Nice Hotel, GREAT Location! The Hotel Milano in Old San Juan is a great place to stay, especially for the location. The hotel is located right in the heart of Old San Juan and is in walking distance to all the sights and all the restaurants and bars in the area. The hotel itself is nice (if not a little dated). The people at the front desk were friendly and are more than happy to hold luggage or call you a cab. Surprisingly, the hotel is quiet at night. We had no problem with noise inside or outside of the hotel while we were sleeping. The rooms are clean (the carpet is a little old) and they come with a cable tv and refrigerator. The price was pretty good when we went also. If you are looking for a nice little hotel where you don't have to worry about transportation, this would be a great choice.

<Content>Milano Was Marvelous! We stayed at Hotel Milano for one night (pre-cruise) in September 2008. As advised by many reviewers, we asked for and received a room at the back of the hotel which was very quiet. We were very pleased with our choice of Hotel Milano! The hotel has a very nice exterior and lobby. The staff were friendly, helpful, and spoke excellent English. The room was very much like a European hotel room 鈥?small but perfectly adequate. Our accommodations were very clean and comfortable. The hotel is perfectly situated for exploring Old San Juan. It is also in the heart of the shopping/dining district with lots of restaurants to choose from within easy walking distance. The hotel鈥檚 rooftop restaurant is a lovely, relaxing spot for sipping a morning coffee and getting a panoramic view of the old city. The restaurant is open for breakfast only 鈥?it is a continental breakfast which costs $5 per person. Our criteria for a hotel are: clean, safe, comfortable, reasonably priced. Hotel Milano met every criteria and we were delighted with our choice. We would definitely stay here again even for an extended stay. Before you book this hotel, be honest with yourself about what you鈥檙e looking for in a hotel. For the price, you can鈥檛 beat this hotel for a clean, comfortable room that is quiet and secure. As other reviewers have pointed out, if you鈥檙e looking for a large hotel with lots of luxurious extras, this is not the hotel for you. You鈥檙e just not going to find it at this price in Old San Juan.

<Content>Hotel Milano works for me I've been staying at Hotel Milano for 5-6 years, and they always deliver. Late arrival, no problem. Insanely early departure, no problem. Always clean, clean, clean, and for Old San Juan, the best value. Just stayed there recently and Hiram and the folks took care of me. Only bummer is that they no longer serve dinner at the rooftop restaurant, but go up for breakfast, the view of San Juan bay is fab.

<Content>Nice and Quaint I found this hotel on tripadvisor.com. We paid about 100.00 USD for it all together ( 2 of us).. let me say, i was really expecting something low class.. but it was really pretty. We experienced the local feel that we wanted to as my friend and i did not want to come to puerto rico and just stay at a hilton or mariott. I believe this place had 4 floors.. and was supposed to have a rooftop bar/restraunt.. but it was closed when we stayed there. We just gof off the royal carribean cruise, and stopped by our hotel to see if the room was ready @ 9am.. little did we know that check in was at 3. Completely fatigued out, we decided that we would just walk around old san juan for a few hours as the hotel is litereally center city (which is an amazing thing btw). We went out for some coffee and came back to rest in about 1/2 an hour.. the owner was so accomodating, he asked for a houskeeper to clear and clean a room.. he then changed our room number and let us settle in early! There is a computer linked with internet in the lobby, which we had to wait a few minutes to use. Overall the hotel is very cute, the room comes with a book of wise sayings. i believe its written by a local poet... its kinda nice. Hotel milano did not seem like a hotel at all.. room and bathroom were spacious, seemed like home. I will recommend it every time !

<Content>Not a luxury hotel, but nice This isn't a luxury hotel and doesn't have a ton of amenities, but it is very nice. We felt that it was our home away from home. It's within walking distance of everything- museums, forts, shops, eateries etc. You even have a trolley stop a block from the hotel, which is convenient for those who don't want to walk to the forts. Also convenient, if you like to shop or want to rest a bit throughout the day- after shopping, we would stop in to rest and drop off bags and after 15 mins or so we'd take off again.I don't know about other posts on here, but our room was clean when we arrived. We got clean towels every day and our room was clean when we got back in the afternoon. If you are used to the Ritz or HIlton, or expect a room like theirs, then this may not be the place for you. Quick check-in/out process.There was a small refrigerator in our room, which was great. A small microwave would've been convenient to heat our leftovers for a late snack, asbit seems that there weren't any eateries that would deliver. (According to one staff member.) Sometimes we'd want to eat something around 11pm and most places were closing or closed. I do have to say that the elevator is a bit scary; we got scared every time it stopped. We didn't go to the restaurant (Panorama), therefore I cannot comment on that. The only thing I know is that it is $5.00 pp, plus tax. (Obviously)The staff was friendly (except for one person who seemed a bit into self) but besides that, excellent service from the rest! We were always greeted by these individuals who called our taxi  even called a few tour companies to try to get us on one. (Thanks!) We had great chats with these individuals and they always managed to say hello and smile. I would stay here again. I am a simple gal who likes the simple things in life.

<Content>Convienient but no frills- so stop complaining!!!! I just want to say by reading some of these reviews people expect the world when they pay very little for a basic room. I mean 85 bucks for a clean decent room in the heart of old san juan- priceless! Pay only $150 and get a room over looking La Fortalanza Street! I have budget traveled all over the world and Hotel Milano gives you best value for your dollar. I come here twice a year every year and love it!!! If you want better amenities book a room at the Hotel Convento and pay $500 a night. Remember you get what you pay for. So stop complaining and enjoy the city and sights. P.S great rooftop garden for drinking your morning coffee.

<Content>charming hotel in Old San Juan Just came back from Puerto Rico on my 25th wedding anniversary. I found the hotel staff very friendly and attentive. They even left a bottle of wine in my room upon my arrival and a congratulatory note. My wife loved the clean room. It is simple and to the point. We wanted a safe, clean place to sleep and be able to conveniently roam about the city. I certainly recommend it. This was the first of three stays throughout Puerto Rico dusring our week. If you are looking for fancy setting, stay elsewhere. But if you want a clean, comfortable room, quiet and secure, then this is the place for the money. I did a lot of research on the area and was not disappointed!

<Content>One of the worst hotel in San Juan I spent two out of six nights here and I must admit that they have been absolutely the worst! Really really rude staff, small rooms, no windows and bad service should be enough to mark this hotel with a big black cross and never come back again!!!In my opinion the best hotel is The Gallery Inn, straight on the ocean, excellent service, big rooms and an artistic touch which makes it just perfect!

<Content>Charming  With the help of TripAdvisor, I found out about this great hotel in San Juan. The staff was friendly, the rooms made me feel like I was right at home, and the location was more than perfect. It's on a cute, cobblestone street with lots of great restaurants and entertainment just steps away.The hotel is not loaded with amenities, but definitely has all the basics you would need to feel more than comfortable. If you plan on exploring the city and just being at the hotel to take a siesta and sleep at night, then Hotel Milano is a great choice. I experienced absolutely no noise pollution as some of the other reviews mentioned. My only complaints were that the shower stall was not totally clean and some of the cereal boxes offered for breakfast were expired. Overall, I recommend Hotel Milano and would stay there again during my next visit to PR.

<Content>Bad customer service This hotel had a great location, decent rooms and a nice rooftop breakfast but that's about all the positive things I can say. The staff was quite rude to us. Every time we went to the lobby they seemed annoyed that we were interrupting their games of solitaire to ask a question. When we'd walk through the lobby, there would be no greeting. It was not a language barrier becuase we are both fluent in Spanish. We were just completely ignored and treated as if the staff was too busy to pay any attention to us. This was our last stop on a 10 day P.R. trip and was hands down the worst customer service of the trip.

<Content>Great location, basic ammenities Hotel Milano is more of a place to sleep than a destination itself. Do not expect to be wowed by the hotel decor, service, or ammenities. Hotel Milano offers clean, basic rooms. Its strength is its location in the heart of Old San Juan, just steps from the best restaurants, bars, and nightlife. If you plan on spending signficant time in your hotel room or are seeking a nice view, upscale furnishings, or a romantic atmosphere, this is not the hotel for you. If you want a place to store your luggage while you explore the city and its surroundings and a safe, convenient place to sleep at night, Hotel Milano is perfect. Due to its location in the center of the best nightlife, it can be loud late in the evenings. The quietest rooms are in the back of the hotel. I stayed for one Saturday night and heard the bass from the clubs until around 4am. However, it wasn't loud enough to really disturb my sleep.

<Content>Ehh... This hotel is not an upscale hotel, despite the description they write up on their webpage and on the front of the tripadvisor page here. There is nothing upscale about this place-- as someone just posted, it does feel like a flashback to the motor hotels so popular more than a while ago. However, the room was pretty clean, but worse for the wear. We didn't pay for breakfast at the hotel, so we can't tell you what that was like.We did have problems with noise, even though we were in room 404 at the rear of the property-- as we had been advised to request. When we went to bed around midnight both nights of our stay, things were relatively quiet. However, both nights we were awakened around 3 a.m. to blaring music from somewhere outside. I am not sure if you should ask for the rear or the front of this property either...When we left at 4:30 a.m. for our flight, we could still hear the thumping in our room. But, when we stepped out into the street to get into the taxi, it was quiet. Bizarre.The staff was largely aloof and wasn't effusively friendly.We also didn't care for the fact that two book-sized religious tracts had been placed in the room prominently by the owner of the hotel. A Bible put into a drawer is okay, but we felt that these books-- which you could buy if you wanted!-- overstepped that line. But of course, those are easily ignored.What is good about the hotel is the location in Old San Juan and there is a free public computer with Internet access and printer.

<Content>Flash Back to the 50s Like others, we wanted a convenient place to spend 2 nights before and 2 nights after a cruise. The Milano really did remind us of a 50s hotel, or one in a third world country - we do a lot of international travel.The carpet and bedding were very old, but clean enough. The plastic flower arrangements and old kitchen table and chairs were very outdated. The television had only a few channels, but we didn't watch much television.We were irritated that the free breakfast was no longer offered and no one bothered to tell us before we booked. It was extremely irritating that the Panorama Restaurant so highly praised is closed until further notice and for sale.The double door/glass hallway security was a nice feature. No problems with noise. On return from the cruise we opted for da House around the corner which was wonderful!

<Content>very nice We found this hotel thru traveladvisor . It is a two star hotel due to the services not offered . However they are the best two star hotel . Meaning the room was very clean and was cleaned every day as was the entire hotel everything was very clean and neat . The air conditioner was as cold as you desired . At night there was no noise ,we were on the third floor. The front desk staff was very friendly and prompt. The location is excellent for walking thru old san juan or to the cruise terminal.You are in an ideal location.They even have an empty mini refrigerator .There is all you need ,no luxury or bellhop.The owner is a type of philosopher poet and there are samples of his thoughts in the room to view .Great Karma at this place . You can tell they are always looking to make sure all is well.Sort of like living in a condo with a good front desk.

<Content>Great price, great location, nice and clean We have stayed at Hotel Milano twice in the past few years. It has an ideal location in historic Old San Juan. You can walk to the incredible old forts, shore side walking paths, and fantastic restaurants. You can also walk to the Bacardi Distillery if you want to. It is in a very nice, safe neighborhood where residents and families are out in the street at night chatting, relaxing, and buying pina coladas outdoors from the corner vendors. There are flowing vines and wrought iron balconies lining the streets, and festivals and parties with traffic routes closed off at night. The hotel itself is not fancy, but clean, with a helpful, friendly staff. The price is right, too, starting at $85 to be in the center of town.It is not very near the big resort/beach areas, but I prefer to go to one of the outlying islands for beach activities, where they aren't overrun with tourists and crowds. Old San Juan is interesting and beautiful for its history and ambience.

<Content>A good place to stop overnight Due to some timing difficulties with the airlines, my husband and I stayed at the Hotel Milano on the first night of our honeymoon before heading to Vieques for the week. It was a short trip from the San Juan airport and an even shorter trip from Isla Grande airport, our destination the next morning. We arrived in the evening while there were two cruise ships in the harbor so the town was bustling. Even so, it wasn't too noisy or chaotic. We had a nice dinner at the Parrot Club down the street, but left too early the next morning for breakfast at the rooftop restaurant. The staff was professional and courteous, our room was comfortable, and we encountered no problems.

<Content>Loved Hotel Milano We loved staying at Hotel Milano and will definately stay there again when we return. The ambience reflected Old San Juan perfectly. I can't say enough of the staff, they were exceptional. My only suggestion would be to open the rooftop in the afternoon for patrons that would like to sit in the sun to read or just relax or in the evenings just to relax and view the city (the rooftop is open for breakfast).I've read a regative review and I'm really sorry they didn't have a good experience. They really missed something wonderful. We travel a great deal and always try to stay in an area where we can experience the local people. We adjust our expectations accordingly. Also, when I make my reservations well in advance, common sense tells me to reverify my reservations before my arrival date.

<Content>The cockroach on the wall was the least of our problems... I grew up on the island and have always known this hotel to be a lovely spot in the heart of Old San Juan. Something must have happened in the past few years...No one helped us with our luggage- even though the bellhop was hanging out in the lobby speaking to the desk clerk. We also arrived to find the famous Panorama restaurant on the top floor closed until further notice. The Panorama, by the way, is also the location of the internet hotspot on the property.The elevator jolts so strongly when it reaches its destination that you desperately grab for something- anything- to hold on to; and it never gets any better.There is a stale carpet smell that permeates the entire place, and upon entering our room our hearts sank. This was not like any of the rooms pictured online- everything was rusty and smelly, there was barely any room to walk, every surface was sticky, the mattress must have been at least ten years old and it showed- the pillows were flat, the blankets had an odor to them, etc. We went to the lobby and requested a room change and were told that nothing could be done, but that they would refund our next two nights stay if we wished. (We had paid for the full three nights months ago). Funnily enough, the lady at the front desk did not seemed surprised at all that we were disappointed with our room- as if this were a common event for her. We decided to toughen up and stay through the night. We watched all of the six channels available on the grimy tv set and laughed at the fact that there was no phone book available (plus even local calls are thirty cents a minute) but there were tons of pamphlets on catholicism on the dresser (all marked as please do not remove from room) The next morning we woke up and there was a cockroach on our wall, just casually traipsing by. Then we headed out to beautiful Old San Juan after waiting for the elevator with a professional. (nope, not kidding).If you are on a super tight budget and want to stay in the heart of Old San Juan ( a definite bonus) then take this place into consideration. This place can definitely be sold as a motel, but that is about it. Consider the HoJo around the corner. They were kind enough to refund our money, however- I genuinely hope that our stay was atypical...

<Content>Great location and nice rooms My family and I stayed at Milano for 2 nights in April and were very pleased with the wonderful location, the cleanliness, and the friendly helpful attitude of all staff. Breakfast on the roof deck was fine too. We did find street noise a problem, and suggest you book upper rooms that face the back or side rather than the main street.

<Content>Noisy  We read the reviews and Hotel Milano sounded acceptable for a short stay in San Juan. The rooftop resturant was a big draw.The rooftop resturant has been closed since December, the free contentinental breakfast is now $5.00 per person. Although we were told none of this on the telephone, we would have been OK if we had been given a room we could sleep in. Our room (303) vibrated with noise from a compressor of some sort outside the window. I asked for a room which was not next to the compressor and was given the key to 403. As this was right above 303, it also vibrated. But, even worse, when I first flipped on the light, a cockroach came scurrying out of the fake plant on the table. I told the clerk about the roach, he offered me the key to room 304. We spent the night in 304. The room has no windows, just some glass blocks near the ceiling. The room vibrated and rumbled all night long. It was loud. The walls were vibrating so much that the framed pictures on the wall vibrated - adding even more noise. The dresser vibrated against the wall- more noise. . Sleep was absolutely impossible. The staff were polite and did alllow us to check out the next morning (a day early) without paying the usual $50.00 fee. All three of the rooms we were shown were completely unacceptable, I would not recoment this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great, unless you plan to spend time in your room We stayed two nights in Hotel Milano last week. For the price and location, this is the place to stay in Old San Juan. Very reasonable (almost cheap!) price, fantastic location - Fortaleza street is where it's at for shopping and restaurant selection. Be ready for street noise/music into the wee hours if you have a room on the street side. The people at the desk were very friendly, professional, and helpful. The $5 breakfast was a good deal but nothing special. The thing we didn't like was that the rooms were small, old, and well, not very nice to hang out in at all. We were often tired from shopping and wanted a place to just hang out and read and relax. This is when we wished we had spend the extra money to stay someplace nicer, like the Gallery Inn. But if you plan to spend all of your time in the streets, shops, and restaurants - go for Hotel Milano!

<Content>Excellent Hotel Milano Hotel Milano was located in the heart of Ole San Juan, Puerto Rico. A short taxi ride from the airport. The location was wonderful if you did not want to rent a car. The Hotel was very clean, rooms small but user friendly. The entire staff was easy to deal with and very helpful. The roof top continental breakfast spot was lovely, the breakfast good. Enjoyed my stay. Would return again and recommend the Hotel Milano to everyone.

<Content>The Hotel Milano, Old San Juan, PR, was a delight. My husband and I stayed 8 nights at the Hotel Milano, 307 Fortaleza Street, Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, and it was everything we needed. The location was right in the heart of Old San Juan on a street with some of the best restaurants in the historic section, between the two forts, and within easy walking distance of all the sights. A generous breakfast, included in the price of the room, was served with Latin music from a jukebox on a roof from which we had a beautiful view. The room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was always kept well-stocked with toiletpaper, facial tissues, soap, and shampoo. The tv in our room had good reception, so we were able to keep up with the news. At the computer in the lobby we printed the boarding passes for the return flight. The entire staff, the housekeepers, concierge, and breakfast-hosts, were pleasant, conscientious, and helpful.

<Content>Overpriced and bland. The hotel I usually stay at in Old San Juan was booked, so we got a room at this hotel. It was way over priced for what it was and the staff was extremely rude to us the second we walked in. The rooms are reminiscent of a really old Days Inn or Super 8. The room wasn't that clean and looked like it hadn't been renovated in over 25 years. The nightly charge was $196, compared to the amazing hotel we usually stay at ($80 - $120), it was a total ripoff. If you are looking for a great place to stay call Da' House. It is a really cute hotel and they have some guest houses too. I have stayed with them a few times and the have beautiful, clean rooms with original art and a friendly staff.Happy travels!

<Content>Very nice, but you might want earplugs The Hotel Milano's location is a real plus during the day because Old San Juan's historic sites and restaurants are all within walking distance. Unfortunately street noise becomes a problem at night if you book a room facing the street. We booked over the phone and were given the choice of a front room with a window, or an inside room without windows. I picked a front room, thinking a windowless room would be claustrophobic... but now I realize it would have the advantage of being quiet!Otherwise, the staff is friendly, our room was clean and comfortable, and we appreciated the mini-fridge. I'd stay there again... I'd just pick up a pair of those foam earplugs at the drugstore first!

<Content>Great place to stay in San Juan We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and had a very good time. The location is great and the people there are very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and nice to come back to even though we spent most of our time outside throughout the streets of Old San Juan and on the beach during the day. The complementary rooftop breakfast in the morning was also a very enjoyable perk. Hotel Milano puts you right in the center of Old San Juan and the beach is only a short bus or cab ride away. The only downside is that it could be a bit noisy depending on where your room is located since the Hotel is on a very busy street. The noise factor however was not an issue for us. Great place to stay!!!

<Content>Another great stay! Stayed at the Milano for 2 nights last year pre-cruise having read about it on Tripadvisor. Was not disappointed then, and booked up for the same again this year. Again not disappointed. Hotel commands an ideal situation for viewing the Old Town, and designer shops. Still great value for money. Hotel is clean, staff welcoming and breakfast adequate considering what the room rate is against other hotels in San Juan. If you want pancakes for breakfast, bacon and all the trimmings, spend another $200 and go elsewhere. The Milano will do for me every time!

<Content>Excellent small hotel in an ideal locationl This is a lovely small hotel with personalised service and excellent value for money. We spent one night in January and two nights in February at the Hotel Milano in San Juan. The hotel is situated in an ideal location, right in the centre of the old town and right next to some really good restaurants. The rooms are comfortable, nicely decorated and have efficient air-conditioning units. On our first night we stayed in one of the rooms which overlooked the street outside and we didn't find it at all noisy, contrary to some other reports we had read. The reception staff were extremely helpful and efficient, particularly Laura. Breakfast is served in the restaurant at the top of the building, where there is also an open patio area with views over the roof tops. Breakfast consists of hot rolls, croissants or apple turnovers, fruit, cereal, juice, tea and coffee. The restaurant at the moment is only open for breakfast. We had two wonderful dinners at the nearby Marmalade Restaurant (pacific rim with a touch of Iberia) and the Tantra (Indo-Latino Cuisine), where there was also an extensive list of exotic martinis. We will definitely stay at this hotel again on our next trip to San Juan.

<Content>Great stay We were recommended to this hotel by a friend, called and made reservation. Great experience. We wanted a smaller room, but the hotel was booked solid so took a Queen on 4th floor with window tat opened. It was a bit noisy sleeping with the window open, but that is a small price to pay for this great city.The check in staff was great, friendly and very helpful. The price was fair, but great value. I met the owner and got chatting. My wife and I ended up going out for drinks and appetizers with him (and he picked up the check which was most generous). His story of coming to America and starting the hotel was fabulous. If you get a chance to chat to him, it is really time well spent as he truly is a good person and we are very glad to be giving him our business.We had breakfast included in our room rate and it was simple but great. The breakfast staff was again a very friendly crew and helpful, interested in what our plans for the day was.This is the only hotel in Old San Juan we will use. Easy to get to and easy to get around walking. Great location for basing one self from.

<Content>Bad sleep, good location Another review warned that some rooms do not have any windows, so when I booked my room I was sure to request a room with a window. Perhaps that was a mistake. Even though we were on the 4th floor, the noise from the busy street in front of the hotel was too loud to allow a good night's sleep. We were there on a Saturday night, and the loud noise from the party crowd on the street lasted until well past 3 AM.I don't know if the hotel has rooms with windows on the back of the hotel away from the street. If so, I would ask for one of those. Otherwise, I would probably opt for a room without windows, or try a different hotel.Parking is a bit of a hassle, so if you will be staying at this hotel at the beginning of your trip, consider renting your car on the day you leave the old San Juan area. If you will be staying here at the end of your trip, turn in your rental car first, then take a cab to the hotel from the rental car place. Then just take a cab to the airport on the day you leave. That's what we ended up doing, and it worked out well. Old San Juan is small enough so you can just walk. No need for a car, particularly since the parking is expensive and 2 blocks away. The hotel's location is excellent for walking around old San Juan.

<Content>While not being exceptional it does not deserve the bad reviews We were a bit concerned when we chose the Hotel Milano in San Juan. Although chose might be the wrong term as all other Hotels were booked out and we had no other choice. Admittedly, we were slightly concerned as there were many negative reviews. For this reason we were expecting an old, bad place. Not so! It is clean and the staff is mostly friendly. We were pleasantly surprised. Futhermore, the location is exceptional: literally in the middle of old San Juan. Do not expect flashy rooms with a magnficient view though: our room had very small windows with a view to brick wall (note that almost all rooms share the same dull view), but its reviews on tripadvisor are way below what it deserves. The only negative aspect is that at night, and especially during weekends, the nearby clubs are quite noisy and you can hear the music. Nothing major - especially if you have earplugs. All in all I would definitely recommend it and I think it deserves a rating of four, especially if consider its location and its extremely good price.

<Content>Milano was exceptional We found the hotel on the WEB. It was clear from reviews at tripadvisor that the owner was an interesting person and that the hotel would likely be to our taste. We were not disappointed on either. We stayed two nights in November, 2007, prior to a cruise. The hotel was very accessible and centrally located in the old town, with ready access to a wide variety of restaurants. We found the old town to be a safe area for evening strolls, and of course great for sightseeing. Our room was spacious and in the front 鈥?while others had complained of noise, we heard none, perhaps because it was November. Quiet all night. The bed was comfortable; the plumbing and air conditioning worked well. Altogether, this was a perfect location for anyone prior to, or just after, a cruise as the boats were just a short distance away. The owner proved to be quite personable and quite interesting to talk with. He was ready to spend time with his guests and to provide advice when requested. We would happily stay there again and we would definitely recommend this hotel to our best friends.

<Content>Service beyond compare Just spent the last two nights of a 10-day Puerto Rico vacation at Hotel Milano. Owner Juan San Emeterio was clearly the highpoint of not only our stay there, but of our entire vacation. He is gracious, attentive, generous, and utterly delightful. Our room was clean, quiet, simple; bed was very comfortable. I would definitely return, but would not stay in the same room due to its only two extremely tiny windows. (To the hotel's credit, the clerk who took the booking mentioned small windows in the only room he said was free; but these were unimaginably tiny - perhaps 10 inches square - high up just below the ceiling. Other guests mentioned their windows were fine.) Only other room problem we encountered was that there was no way to control the AC until we asked, but then we were given one of (only) two existing remotes from the front desk, which worked fine. We loved being able to have continental breakfast outside on the rooftop, although encroaching development is fast shrinking the view of the city. The evening restaurant grill is no longer in operation, but there are so many great restaurants worth exploring within even just a block of the hotel that we had no shortage of great dining experiences. Juan also gave us excellent recommendations, so each of our meals in Old San Juan were really great. The hotel location is superb for walking around Old San Juan. And when we wanted to go outside the city, Juan facilitated trips to the produce market, the Santurce Art Museum (beautiful!),etc., including to the airport when we departed. I can't wait to return to San Juan, to bask in the warmth of the city as well as the warmth that emanates from Juan San Emeterio and Hotel Milano.

<Content>Not recommended This hotel is aged and the rooms small. The staff is not helpful at all, although the man at the breakfast room (truly a continental breakfast, if you can even call it that and the food is lousy) was nice. Guests are not a priority here - I felt like they just wanted my money. The hotel staff, especially the front desk, is not attentive at all and border on rude. The rooms are dismal and feel like they haven't been changed for 50 years, but not in a good way. You can do better.

<Content>As long as you don't mind not sleeping... After researching many websites, I choose Hotel Milano based on favorable reviews. All I can say is they were WRONG. The Rooms are in desparate need of remodeling. The carpets are crunchy- as in I don't know whats on them, but wear your slippers. The bed was small (advertised as a queen- closer to a full size) and had a huge lump in the middle that left my husband clinging to the bed all night to keep from rolling out. The worst part though- the all night dance music that started at 10:00pm and finally stopped at 5:00am. Loud enough to shake the bed. On the positive side, the staff was helpful and the location can't be beat. I would not recomend this hotel to anyone wishing for a good nights sleep!

<Content>Perfect location in Old San Juan I stayed in Hotel Milano as the first stop of my honeymoon. We took a cab from the airport (which is easy because there is a line-up for cab's at the airport and set prices in San Juan, $22 to Hotel Milano.) The person working the front was very nice, the hotel lobby was clean and attractive, and our room was very clean as well.I've read some review on here saying that it's too loud staying on the front-side of the hotel but I didn't notice an issue. Although if you are a VERY light sleeper and wanted to go to bed early (before midnight) you might notice the the stereo of the odd passing car. The hotel's location is the best part, not even a block away from a bunch or really good restaurants and bars. Our favourite was El Toro Salao which does mostly tapas.In general a good hotel for a little bit more reasonable price compared to other hotels in Old San Juan.

<Content>Milano is very pleasant We enjoyed a pleasant night's stay at the Milano. Room was clean and comfortable, and reasonably priced for San Juan. Staff was very helpful and courteous. At least on the upper floor where we were staying it was quiet. And the continental breakfast was very substantial.

<Content>Good value accommodation for old San Juan A good value, clean, friendly independent hotel right in the heart of old San Juan. The hotel is nothing fancy, but does what it does very well indeed. The the public areas, the bedroom and the linen were comfortable, well-maintained and clean. Our room only had high-level windows with a view (if you are tall) of blank walls and air-conditioning units, but that didn't matter to us - we were out and about most of the time.The roof terrace breakfast area was very pleasant with views (restricted) in all directions, but was not accessible directly from the elevator (a short flight of steps). The breakfast was included and was fairly basic, but adequate. We didn't try the restaurant.We found the hotel a perfect base for exploring old San Juan on foot before joining a cruise ship. If you have mobility problems neither the hotel nor the area are ideal. The hotel is on a very narrow and congested one-way street. If you expect to park a rental car anywhere nearby... forget it! Even the taxis have to block the traffic to pick or drop off. Being in the old town the taxi ride from the airport will be slightly further than to the main beach hotels, but still only came to $20 for two people with a case each.We liked it and would stay there again.

<Content>Rooms without Windows Many rooms at the Hotel Milano have NO windows. None, they are like closets. I reserved directly through the hotel and neither their website or any of the communications I had regarding my reservation made any mention that the $155 room I had booked was window-free. I would have never reserved the room and in fact would have paid more for even a sliver of real light. It was really claustrophobic.Of course by the time I was in, the place was full - as was San Juan - so I had no choice. A sympathetic staff person said it was the policy to only tell people their room would not have a window if they asked. When was the last time you thought to ask: will my room have a window?Other complaints (which I would normally let go, but am willing to list given the hotel's unethical policies regarding giving guests full information about their rooms):1) The advertised wi-fi doesn't always work. Another guest and I couldn't get the system to give our laptops IP addresses to connect.2) Breakfast only lasts until 10am, not uncommon but with a noon check-out time you'd think staff would let guests know the hours, especially given the relatively generous check-out time. I found no hours posted in the room (I did find some lights so I could see in the room...)3) Also minor but worth noting: the TV channel selection is woeful. C-SPAN but not network stations that would show things like the NFL during playoff season.All-in-all, I wish I could have liked the Hotel Milano but the egregious policies regarding the sale of windowless rooms plus the general lack of comfort means I can't. At least I wasn't tempted NOT to spend every waking moment outside of the hotel enjoying San Juan.

<Content>Great Staff, Good Location in Old San Juan We stayed at the Hotel Milano for 1 night pre-cruise on Friday, December 7th. The rooms are clean and simple. The beds are comfortable. The comments about the potential for noise are true. There was a street party due to the clubs near the hotel from 12 to 4:00 a.m. The hotel staff shared that this happens every weekend. There is an authentic Puerto Rican restaurant 1/2 a dozen doors down from the hotel. We had both dinner and breakfast while staying there.The price charged for the room is good for the accomodations provided.The hotel staff was very pleasant and provided excellent service.

<Content>Comfortable hotel in Old San Juan This is a comfortable and friendly hotel right in the centre of Old San Juan. We originally booked for one night, but decided to stay a second and the receptionist helpfully rearranged other bookings so that we could stay in the same room. We had a room at the back of the hotel, with a window which looked out onto a boring back yard and other buildings, but it meant we could sleep with the window open without being unduly troubled by noise. Rooms are clean and pleasant, if nothing out of the ordinary.The rooftop restaurant is a lovely spot for breakfast, with an indoor and an outdoor section. The breakfast is fairly basic. Excellent coffee, but tea is the usual weak affair that has to be specially requested (Oh well, if we British must travel abroad, what can we expect ....?) It is a pity the restaurant now seems to be permanently closed in teh evenings. But there are restaurants all around, so it doesn't really matter. And the location is so convenient for sight-seeing; you can easily pop back during the day if you want to.We paid $115 for a double room which seemed good value and I would certainly consider staying there again if we ever return to San Juan.

<Content>Decent hotel but nothing special After reading reviews on trip advisor, we decided to stay at the Hotel Milano during a recent trip to Puerto Rico but was slightly disappointed with the hotel. While it has a cute lobby and is in a good location (though a little noisy because it is on a busy main street) the rooms did not have much character. They were clean but very plain and basic. Some of the rooms do not have windows so make sure you ask about that. The ones that do face the street and can be a bit noisy. The breakfast was very plain and nothing special as well. The staff were friendly and fairly helpful. Overall, I found the hotel to be just ok - clean and basic- so if that's all you're looking for it could be a good choice. I think it is overpriced for what you get unless you can get a very good rate. I stay at many small botique hotels and know what to expect but found this too be a little too best western for what we were expecting when paying close to $200 a night. Unfortunately I don't know that there are any better choices in Old San Juan unless you are willing to spend much more for a room.

<Content>Hotel Milano friendly, convenient, perfect location, bargain We were looking for a clean, safe, centrally located place to stay while doing a walking tour of Old San Juan over a couple of days. We did an internet search and found articles in the New York Times recommending this hotel. We booked the double beds streetside via email. The place was just great. It was not as classy as a boutique hotel (it is very nice, but not a romantic hidaway) and not the upper end like The Convent. But it was exactly what we wanted. An absolutely wonderful location. Very very friendly and accomodating. Clean. Safe. It appeared to have a nice rooftop restaurant and bar, which we looked very much forward to using, but it was closed because of staff vacation. But this hotel is within a couple of blocks (very safe walking) of some of the best restaurants on the planet.

<Content>great location,price and staff Great hotel for a good price and great location. My wife and I stayed overnight after our cruise ended in Puerto Rico. The hotel is a short walk from the pier and about a 15 minutes taxi ride to the airport.The hotel staff was friendly and courteous and allowed us to leave our luggage in a safe area as we arrived at 10:30am and check-in wasn't till 3:00 pm. This hotel is centrally located in old San Juan making everything within walking distance. There are shops up and down the street if you want to get a taste of the Puerto Rican culture.We happened to book the last available room for the night and it was in the front or street side of the hotel. I would suggest you book early and get a room in the back. I don't think this is a problem unique to the Hotel Milano as the streets are narrow in old San Juan with lots of vehicle traffic.Also there was a large festival in the town square of Old san Juan during our stay which may have affected he noise factor.My wife and walked through the streets at night and felt safe and the locals are very friendly with directions. The breakfast in the morning is adequate and the manager is a very nice fellow.I was very pleased with the Hotel Milano and if you check prices for other hotels in the area they are very reasonable. I would definitely recommend this hotel. ]

<Content>Good Value Great location. We stayed one night prior to a cruise and five nights after the cruise. Good value, great location for touring Old San Juan. Roof top restaurant is closed and will probably stay closed. I expect the competition of the many great restaurants within walking distance (everything in Old Town is within walking distance) is too much to overcome. The restaurant is open for a modest but adequate breakfast every day - which you may supplemented by a visit to any one of several good bakeries nearby (if you can afford to put on a few more pounds). Good WiFi connection on the roof too. The daytime desk clerk is helpful but the porter/breakfast manager is especially cordial and will be a great information resource. On street parking is available if you are extremely lucky. Three nearby garages charge significantly different overnight rates. Check with the hotel to see which is currently the most reasonable. The Bacardi rum factory tour is worth doing even if you are not into rum. Take the ferry from Pier 2 to add to the enjoyment.

<Content>Don't Plan on a Rooftop Party We stayed one night at the Hotel Milano in November. One of the reasons we chose it was the rooftop dining. The rooftop dining is not currently open. Bed was soft, and I have a bad back. Don't pay more than $100 a night, or you'll be paying for more than you get. Also, there was weird Christian proselytizing material in the room which annoyed me.

<Content>Good Value at Moderate Price Hotel Milano's strengths are its central location in Old San Juan and its co-operative, obliging staff. We had one of the less expensive rooms, $85.50 after AARP discount, and we found our view on two sides was of the hotel's outer walls. To be fair, the desk clerk had told me on the telephone that walls would be our view. Continental breakfast included a choice of cold cereals, bananas, fruit juice, grocery-store pastry. To get to the roof-top dining room, with a distant view of the harbor, one must climb a flight of stairs. The lobby computer was down for repairs and staff graciously let me meet a business need by using a back-office computer.

<Content>Location, Location. We stayed for two nights on our way to Antigua. The reception clerk was helpful. The room was OK. The breakfast was very ordinary. The best thing is the location , right in the heart of Old San Juan. I was last in San Juan in 1967 so I saw a big change.It is sad that you cannot get a beer in a glass, ( some places will not let you drink out of the bottle ) because of a local habit of smashing the glass in your face. On reflection I suppose the plastic cup was the way to go!

<Content>Perfect For the price, We had a very nice stay at the Hotel Milano. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We had stayed in a full size room in the back of the hotel. It was a little smaller than i expected but turned out to be more than adequate for the amount of time we spent in the room. There was some noise from the nightclubs over the weekends but nothing loud enough that you can't sleep. What made this hotel was their great location, friendly staff, and affordabke rates. I would definitly stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Bad back beware After staying at the SJ Suites in 2006 we wanted to try the Hotel Milano for our 2007 trip, especially after all the rave reviews on Trip Advisor. What a bad choice. When we got to the hotel we asked to see the room as my partner suffers from a bad back and she needs a firm bed. When I booked the room I was told that the beds were new and the mattresses very firm. What a lie. The mattress in our room was terrible as was the service at the front desk. When we complained about the bed we were told that there was nothing they could do about it. No one at the front desk cared or was willing to assist us. Well we did something about it and went back down the street to the SJ Suites and were able to get a room there for all but the first night of our stay. It was worth the extra $50 charge to get of starying at the Milano. We did stay one night however my partner had to sleep on the floor. The room iwas OK but the bathroom was dirty with hair all over the floor. Hotel Milano NOT. By the way the advertised free breakfast not worth it. Better to go around the corner to La Bonbonera and have a real breakfast.

<Content>Milano is the best! We just came back from a family reunion cruise and all 14 of us stayed the night before and the night after the cruise at the Milano and it was great. The service was excellent and the location is perfect for visiting old San Juan. The roof top restaurant was very nice with great food and we spent a lot of time up there as a group. The only advice we would offer is to expect a cozy inn type experience, with excellent service and great food. Also, if you want the largest rooms ask for the ones in the front of the building but if you want the lowest rates ask for one of the smaller inner rooms. One of our relatives did and she was perfectly comfortable and satisfied with it.

<Content>Great place to stay in Old San Juan Like a lot of others, we needed somewhere to stay overnight in/near Old San Juan prior to our cruise ship departure. Based on reviews from this web site, we chose Hotel Milano. The rates were great, the staff was very friendly, and the room was perfect. We enjoyed dinner and breakfast on the rooftop restaurant, and walked from the hotel to the shopping district and El Morro, before departing that evening. The hotel provides a secure place to leave your luggage for the day, the cruise dock is walking distance. This hotel is NOT a Westin or Marriott resort - don't expect that. It's a quaint little inn, great for a short stay and perfect for those cruising from San Juan. I'd stay there again. One recommendation (which we did): get a room with a window if you can. Some rooms are interior.

<Content>Hotel Milano Rocks! I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Milano in San Juan and everything was beyond my expectations for an enjoyable trip. I even had the room with no real windows, but glass that allowed sunlight in! The price was right, the air cooled, the room very clean and updated, the tv worked great, and the refrigerator was a bonus. Free breakfast in the morning, and great food for dinner if desired. You even get as much free bottled water as desired! I love the rooftop restaurant as you can be under a canopy overlooking the bay or inside the airconditioned part of the restaurant. To round out the experience, the hotel is very centrally located to catch all the sights. A lovely place and the owner is very nice too. I definitely highly recommend the Hotel Milano as a place to stay in San Juan. I know I'll return!

<Content>It served it's purpose We stayed here for one night during our brief stay in San Juan. The hotel was fine for what we were looking for. It was not anything fancy, but it served it's purpose.The staff was very nice and helpful from check in to check out and afterwards because we left our bags there while we walked around Old San Juan till we had to leave for the airport.The Panorama Restaurant on top of the hotel had good food and nice service for dinner. The continental breakfast left alot to be desired though. We reserved a room facing the street by accident because my other half misunderstood me when (after reading here) I told him not to get a room on the street. It wasn't that bad though, I was woken up around 1:30 in the morning by a car going by playing exceptionally loud music but never heard all of the street noise everyone is mentioning. I have stayed in the French Quarter off of Bourbon Street and heard more noise than I heard at this hotel.The room was just an average room, but it served it's purpose. We were not expecting a 5 star hotel though. The a/c was HOT when we got in the room, but when we called down to the desk, they told us we needed to pick up the remote to change the temperature. Once we did that, it was fine. The room had cooled off by the time we came back from dinner.We would definitely stay there again as it is in a VERY convenient location in Old San Juan. We walked to all three forts from there and all around town. The bus goes by it as well. The manager recommended The Parrot Club to us for lunch and we were VERY happy with his recommendation. Both of the men that manned the front desk were extremely pleasant and helpful.Hope this helps.ElizabethNew Orleans, LA

<Content>Nice small hotel Great location and very nice clean rooms. We specifically requested a front room knowing it would be noisy. It was but not to the point that you could not sleep. If you want a central location and not a mega resort this is a great choice. Our only criticism would be the beds should be a little better and the restaurant service. We went up for appetizers one night and drinks the next. Both times our server never came back to ask if we wanted another round. On the second night we (as well as another table) had to go inside to get our own check and pay. But the hotel itself met our expectations and exceeded some of the comments we have read on this board.

<Content>Great stay We had a great stay at the Hotel Milano. For the price and location, I think it was definitely worth it and would recommend it to friends. It's not fancy, but we thought the decorations and cleanliness and general comfort were just fine. The rooms are simple but we were happy with ours. We took the advice of one of the reviews here and stayed in a rear-facing room, so we had no problems with noise. The windows are incredibly tiny but at least gave a little light, and the room size was fine. The staff were very nice, always happy to hold our key when we'd go for a run (and then laugh with us when we came back very humid) or greet us at breakfast. Breakfast was simple but there was plenty of food and the restaurant atmosphere is nice. The best part of the hotel, in my opinion, is its location. Where you'd be paying a Lot more for a different hotel in old San Juan, here you saved the money and were still in the thick of it. There is lots of shopping on or just off Forteleza street, and lots of bars and restaurants and the casino are about a 10 minute walk. The bar where pina coladas were invented is a 10 minute walk up Forteleza. You can walk easily to El Morro or San Cristobal or explore the north shore. It's a little under a 2 mile walk to the nearest beach. The cruise port and lots of little shopping stands along the south shore are really close, too. Get a good map and enjoy wandering through the city!

<Content>Hotel Milano not so nice, needs to be renovated  We read reviews and thought this sounded like a great little place. It was just OK. I think it would probably be between a 2  3 star hotel in europe. The streets below were very noisy all night long with cars full of people yelling and playing very loud music until 4:30 am, almost impossible to sleep (it was on a Sunday and Monday night). The rooms and showers were pretty clean, but rooms need to be renovated, yucky carpet and bed spreads. You could probably do better else where.

<Content>Not what I'd call upscale at all We booked one night at the Hotel Milano based on the reviews we'd read here, and I was sorely disappointed. It was hardly upscale (as described on its own webpage), nor as nice as I'd been led to believe it would be from the other reviews. I actually, for a while, wondered if there were two Hotel Milanos and we'd somehow wound up at the wrong one.The staff, from what we saw of them, were pleasant enough. The room, though, was way too warm (the A/C barely brought it down to a comfortable level), the bed was too soft and the pillows too hard. The hallways and stairways looked very worn and shabby.Our biggest problem was at night. Our room faced the street, and we can tell you exactly what time the bars in San Juan close on Saturday nights: 4am. The noise was unbelievable, and kept us awake most of the night. We tried to make light of it and joke about it, but I would definitely not stay there again because of it.The hotel's restaurant atop the hotel offered a nice view of Old San Juan. The dinner we had there that night was actually quite good. The breakfast, though, was another disappointment. Very little in the way of variety, even for a Continental-style breakfast.As I said, I was very surprised to have this experience after all the glowing reviews I'd read about it. Oh well... Live and learn, I guess.

<Content>Shocking experience I booked this hotel based on reviews here via Expedia for a priest who presided over my son's wedding in San Juan. We got an incredibly rude treatment, starting with manager claiming he had no confirmation from Expedia and ending with manager telling my priest guest to get out of my hotel. I would hate to think (given all the positive reviews here)my guest received this treatment because he did not look the type of guest the hotel manager wanted in his hotel.

<Content>DISAPPOINTED This hotel was nothing like it was described.The matress was very uncomfortable and the pillows were thick. There was a lot of noise from the street well into the morning. The breakfast was not good. sugary muffins, sugary juices.,over riped fruit ,warm coffee. The employees were pleasent though.

<Content>Great location, comfortable rooms On our first night in Puerto Rico, we stayed in Old San Juan. When we arrived we found that a street festival was taking place that weekend on Fortaleza Street, including the block in front of Hotel Milano. So needless to say, this hotel is in a great location. There are a bunch of trendy restaurants within a block (highly recommend The Parrot Club -- amazing mojtos and food) and you can walk to both forts and all of the sights of Old San Juan from the hotel. The location can't be beat. The rooms were very comfortable and the desk staff very helpful. Our only complaint was the continental breakfast, which was on par with something like a Holiday Inn in the U.S. I think we just expected something with more of a local feel. All in all, for the price, Hotel Milano is highly recommended.

<Content>A European Experience We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Milano. This is not your typical oversized American-style resort experience. And that's exactly why we adored it! If you are in love with the authentic experience of staying in centrally located hostels of Europe, you will love this little hotel. Hotel Milano gives you the perfect location. You can be in and out several time a day while touring. Stop in, grab a nap, get freshened up and hit the town. If you are concerned about the noise, stay a few floors up. We were on the 8th floor and had wonderful night sleep.

<Content>Wedding Reception Extraordinairre We have stayed at the Hotel Milano many times over the years because it's the best boutique hotel in Old San Juan and we enjoy Juan, the amazing owner of Milano as well as his exceptional staff. So, when we decided to marry in Old San Juan, we knew that's the place we wanted to bring our friends and family. We all had a truly wonderful experience there over several days. We were treated royally, with lovely red roses waiting for us in our room. Our friends and family all loved the gracious staff and convenient location. The staff were so joyful and so helpful in preparation for the reception that we all had fun getting ready with them. Our evening at the wonderful Panorama Restaurant was perfect. The food, a blend of local and Cuban delights, was delicious. The staff was superb. Everyone who joined us could not say enough about their experience there. We had a wonderful, wonderful time. It's the people who make the place!

<Content>Rip off! Consumer beware! Arrived to find a depressingly hot, dank, tiny, shabby UNACCEPTABLE room for the $175+taxes. Although I agreed to pay their $50 cancellation fee, my credit card was charged $196.75 for NO services rendered. Surely they rented the room twice that night (April 20) and somebody pocketed some easy money!I want a refund. Why should a consumer be so easily tricked into paying for a bad product site unseen?

<Content>Unfortunately too loud The staff is great, the location is great, the rooms were clean, the A/C worked well. The only problem is the discoteca that is behind the property. We were there on a Saturday and Sunday night and the bass from the discoteca reverberated through our beds until 5AM both nights. I don't think that there is anything that the hotel can really do about it, but unfortunately it makes sleep pretty much impossible if you're at all a light sleeper. Everything else though was very nice.

<Content>Nice hotel!! I went to Rio Grande, Puerto Rico for a conference but heard that I should visit Old San Juan while I was in Puerto Rico. So my last night there, I stayed in the heart of Old San Juan at the Milano Hotel. I got the queen room with two windows. It was very clean and nice and staff were very friendly and helpful. I would definately stay there again!!

<Content>Great small hotel in the old town There can't be many hotels on earth owned by such a fascinating man as this one. The rooms are all equipped not only with everything you need for a very comfortable (and affordable) stay, but also with copies of the owner's writings - thoughts, reflections and words of wisdom, a kind of cross between Khalil Gibran and Marcus Aurelius. He himself is an inspired and inspiring presence, and a stay in his wonderful, charmed hotel is capable of changing the course of a person's life. There are testimonies on the internet to this effect. It seems he will drop everything for a deep conversation with a guest.The hotel also has a wonderful rooftop bar and restaurant, which is great place to catch the evening light and eat excellent local gourmet food.

<Content>Local hotel with friendly staff If you want a local hotel close to the action, this is it. It's a short walk to clubs, restaurants, the pier and shopping. The roof top restaurant offers a cool respite on hot summer nights. The food and service are excellent. The staff is friendly and English is spoken.

<Content>Just a place to sleep We booked hotel Milano just needing a place to stay the night after our late flight in. We weren't looking for anything fancy, but in a convenient location to Old San Juan. Our room was in need of some cleaning. The room was drab and could use a fresh coat of paint. My mom was afraid to take off her shoes--the carpet was dirty and looked like it hasn't been cleaned in ages. Breakfast was very average: milk, coffee, bananas, small boxed cereals, toast, and prepackaged (vending machine type) muffins and donuts.The only thing that stood out was the front desk service. The man was very informative and helpful as far as finding late-night meals.

<Content>Nice if you don't have a rental car I took a five-day trip around Puerto Rico staying in Old San Juan two nights. When I drove up to check into the hotel, I had to move the barracades from in front of the hotel to parallel park since it is a narrow one-way street. When I was going up to my room, the receptionist informed me that I had to move my car to public parking. It was an inconvenience that they did not offer a service man to do that. The last thing that anyone wants to do is drop off your luggage walk half a mile each way and then get ready to go out. The parking garages that are available are pretty expensive. The cheapest that was around was $1 for the first hour and $.65 for each additional hour. This adds up if you are staying for more than one night. The hotel itself has a nice appearance. There wasn't a window to look out of due to being in squeezed in by buisnesses on both sides. The room was clean and spacious, but the air-conditioner was a bit squeeky. It quieted down a bit after being turned on for several hours.The hotel is obviously located in a convenient location. There are many restaurants, shops and bars close by. Nice location, a bit overpriced $149+tax, to not include parking somehow. You will enjoy this hotel if you are just staying in Old San Juan.

<Content>The Milano was OK We just returned from a two night stay at Hotel Milano. When we checked in the receptionist at the front desk was not too friendly. However we never did see him again, and from then on they all were friendly. To our disappointment there was no internet connection in the room. We were told that there was a connection in the restaurant, but it was open only certain hours. When we opened the door to the room, it had a musty smell, but the A/C was on. We asked someone about it, and was told that a remote was needed, which was brought to us. The room was OK but we thought it would at least have windows--it only had three small glass sqaures at the top to let in a little light. The restaurant, Panorama, was supposed to have a view, but there was a tall building under construction blocking most of the view of the water. The black bean soup was delicious. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is very conveniently located to everything in Old San Juan.

<Content>A Flavor of Old San Juan Hotel Milano is embedded in the midst of the action of Old San Juan and really gives you the flavor of the city. Absolutely everything is within easy walking distance and it is so great to see the activities on Fontaleza, the primary thoroughfare of Old San Juan. Althought the elevator was being worked on our host and his staff went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and accessible. The owner is available, charming and down to earth. The staff is very helpful and it was great having a rooftop restaurant (Panorama) with both outdoor and indoor dining that was very good. We stayed for three nights before our cruise and will do so in the future, opportunity presenting. Thank you Juan and staff for a terrifici stay!

<Content>Hotel Milano We stayed at the Hotel Milano for two nights prior to our cruise and we had a great time. The employees were very helpful and pleasant. The location was ideal. We would recommend this small but nice hotel if you want to stay in Old San Juan.

<Content>Not a great experience Two weeks on a cruise ship was an awesome trip. I didn't think about home or felt homesick in two weeks until I stayed at Hotel Milano. It was not a great feeling, when I first walk inside my room I smelled mildew. Maids did not clean the bathroom thoroughly and didn't change the sheets. Trying to have a nice peaceful rest but can't because music is blasting from the nightclub next door. Some employees were not helpful about finding an excursion of San Juan. Breakfast had limited choices, it did not accomondate guests who have a specific needs to their diets.Upside of the location is it's in Old San Juan and you can get your daily exercise walking the streets browsing through the upscale stores and there's police in every corner of the street to protect the tourist.

<Content>Disappointed My family and I went on a Caribbean Cruise and after our cruise, we decided to saty 2 days in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. We decided to stay at Holtel Milano because it was advertised as an affordable and upscale hotel. Another reason why we wanted to sat at Hoel Milano was also because Internet access would be available for guest. HOWEVER........we were really disappointed! It was not an upscale hotel, the rooms and bathrooms were dirty. There was Mildo in the shower! Also, when I went to ask to use the computer, I was told that you only get to use the internet if you bring your laptop. That shows that this hotel was false advertising! Also, we found that it was really difficult to sleep at night because there were two bars/clubs located near the hotel. You could hear people yelling and cars blasting with loud music.The only thing I can say that is positive about this hotel is that the location of the hotel is very central for walking distance around Old San Juan.

<Content>We loved This Little Hotel This small Hotel has very friendly front desk staff, clean rooms, wonderful hot shower and you step out of the hotel into the middle of lovely old San Juan. The desk staff could not have been nicer. I book by calling the hotel directly and all went very well. The bed was comfortable and clean. The roof top restaurant may have had a view of the ocean but construction on a new building on the water front now blocks the view. Well we did not spend much time at the restaurant anyway. There are great restaurants on the same street as the hotel. The continental breakfast was not good but adequate- cereal and boring toast and lousy coffee but fear not a Starbucks is nearby. We would definitely book this hotel again. We love the Hotel Milano!

<Content>Loved our stay My partner and I arrived on new years eve. We had a speedy check-in, and found our room to be a very clean, of good size but with a relatively noisy but efficient air conditioning unit (which we simply turned off and on as required). The shower was lovely, with plenty of hot water.The room overlooked the street, and so we got a bit of noise but it didn't detract from the experience. The hotel has an excellent location - right in the middle of Old San Juan. We had an enjoyable complimentary breakfast at the rooftop patio restaurant every morning. All in all - a lovely place to stay, and great value.

<Content>Good Experience at Hotel Milano We just stayed for one night at Hotel Milano after being on Culebra for a week. We were a large group and had 3 rooms. We found the Milano to suit our needs well. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful at check-in. One of the rooms in our group had been booked separately, so they didn't know we were together. They made sure to put us on the same floor, which we really appreciated. We were in the front of the building and yes, there is some noise, but the a/c blocks most of it out. The beds are very soft and bouncy, so some people may not like that, others may love it. Rooms are small, but very clean. The rooftop restaurant was nice and had a good view. Breakfast, as has been said, is basic, but adequate to start the day.We only had 2 problems. The a/c in our friends' room got very cold, to the point of being too cold to sleep. The a/c is not adjustable, so it was that or open the windows and have the noise of the street. The 2nd thing is more of an issue than a problem. We wanted to print out our boarding passes for our flights home, but they didn't seem too eager to do this. After asking a couple times, we finally got to go into the office and a gentleman working there had to stop working on his computer so I could print out our passes. He was not too friendly about this, but I don't know how much I can blame him---we were disrupting his work! It would be great if they had a small business area where this could be done without disrupting any of the employees.Other than that, it was a great stay! We would definitely return!

<Content>It is what it is This hotel is what it is. It's directly in the middle of Old San Juan. It's a decent, clean, maintained bed and bathroom. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Don't expect a five star hotel. My girlfriend and I spent very little time there, but it sure was convienant. Also, the continental breakfast was adaquate and the view from the resturant was very nice. We had a room in the front of the hotel overlooking the street. I would highly advise you book a room in the back of the hotel. Granted there may be no windows, but the noise from the street is substantial and continues late into the morning. It was bothersome in the room we stayed in, however, I don't believe it would be a problem in the interior rooms.

<Content>Great Value Hotel Spent 2 nights at the Milano pre-cruise. Hotel is in a great location for the designer shops, Polo, Guess, Gant etc, and for touring Old San Juan. Staff at the Hotel friendly and helpful. Continental style breakfast more than adequate. We had a Queen room at the front of the hotel, which was very noisy on the Saturday night as the local youngsters are out enjoying themselves till the early hours. Suggest you pay the Milano a visit, and request a quiet room at the back of the hotel. We intend to go back to San Juan again next year and have no qualms about staying at this fine hotel again.

<Content>Stay if you want NO sleep! My fiance and I stayed at this hotel (in a rear-full room) for an overnight layover before heading to another island. We got in late after a day of traveling and were very tired, hoping to get some sleep. That did NOT happen!! There was some club or something right next door blasting music (this was a Sunday night, not Fri. or Sat.) until at least 3 am. I can't tell you if it went any later b/c I actually managed to fall asleep finally. The bed and the whole room were quite small - and the bed was the type that if one person moves the other is disturbed. I normally have positive things to say about everywhere I stay b/c I am not very picky...I'm not above a super 8 every now and then...but all I wanted was some good sleep and I did not get it here!!!The only good thing was the location to popular tourist sites. We were able to walk to El Morro the next morning before catching our flight.I would spend a bit more $$ and stay somewhere else if comfort is a priority. This place might be okay for partiers who would want to be in on that late night noise:)

<Content>Excellent stay In February 鈥?7 we stayed at the Hotel Milano in Old San Juan, PR for three nights before our Panama cruise. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Milano. As many of you have commented, it is situated in the middle of Old San Juan in the perfect location for visiting the forts, restaurants, and nightlife. We had a very pleasant room on the fourth floor facing the street with little or no street noise during our visit. Housekeeping kept the room immaculate. The restaurant on the roof terrace served delicious meals in the evening. What impressed us the most were the attentiveness and kindness of the owner/manager Juan San Emeterio and his staff. He was the perfect host beginning with his prompt email responses regarding our reservation to his seeing us off when we checked out. We encourage you to consider the Hotel Milano on your next visit to San Juan and to take the time become acquainted with Juan. He is a very interesting and erudite gentleman. You will come to find him to be a writer/poet/artist and an interesting individual. When we next visit San Juan, we will definitely stay at the Hotel Milano and look forward to seeing Juan again.

<Content>Priced right, great location, friendly service. We stayed two nights before a cruise and one night after the cruise. Picked the Milano because we wanted a reasonable priced place in the hear of Old San Juan. We were not disappointed with the accommodations, location, service and price. It's an old hotel with plenty of warm friendly atmosphere complemented by a friendly helpful staff. The roof top restaurant is a definite plus with good food and prices are lower than other comparable restaurants in the area.Yes, the rooms were small and basic but are priced right. They were clean, the water was hot and the air conditioner worked well. We had a back room which was by choice due to possible street noise in the front and we slept like babies.The continental breakfast was pretty basic but enough to get you started and on your way to enjoy the sights and shopping within walking distance.We were especially impressed with the service provided by Juan, Laura and Miguel.Thank you for an enjoyable stay and we look forward to our next visit to Puerto Rico and Hotel Milano.

<Content>A real gem The Hotel Milano is one of the great finds we located on our trip to Puerto Rico for the month of February. It is not easy to find reasonably priced hotels very close to Old San Juan. The Hotel Milano is in the middle of Old San Juan, convenient to all of the shopping and restaruants that are in the Old San Juan area. The Hotel Milano is clean. The entire hotel staff, from the front desk to the wait staff in the restarunt and the housekeeping staff, treat customers like they value their business. I don't think you can go wrong booking in the Hotel Milano. We will be back next year.WRC from Maryland.

<Content>We loved the Milano! The location is fantastic! All the 'hottest' restaurants are just down the street - so is the cruise ship terminal - and there is a trolley that stops outside the front door, that will take you all over old San Juan. Our room was spotlessly clean, with comfortable beds, and a little eating nook which overlooked the front street. The staff was friendly and helpful...all in all, we had a great stay at the Milano, and would certainly return the next time we are in San Juan.

<Content>little gem but has a noisy problem we stayed for one night at hotel milano. Great location lovely staff but one big problem...dont stay in the front of the hotel if you want a good nights sleep! We stayed in a lovely room with gorgeous view of old san juan but the noise was so bad neither of us slept......beware the management do not tell you about the noise problem when you book a front room.It is a lovely hotel and the staff do there best to help when you mention the noise problem, it is the ideal hotel to stay at for visitng old san juan...just be aware if you stay at front of the hotel on a weekend you arent going to sleep!

<Content>Clean rooms and friendly service We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Milano. This is definitely not a luxury hotel, but our three rooms were clean and comfortable. They were exactly as described in the email correspondence that I had with the owner. The location is fabulous. It is easy walking to some very nice park areas, the bay, and of course the shops and restaurants of Old San Juan. The check-in and the overall service were very friendly and efficient. We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant and the food was very good, if not overly memorable. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and made good suggestions to please our tastes. The front desk person took the time to give us suggestions about a walking tour that we could do. Our party included two 30 year olds, two 60 year olds, and one 90 year old. His suggestions allowed for all of us to enjoy the stroll with some opting for more virorous routes than others.It is nice to know that we have a good place to stay for our future travels to San Juan. Thanks to Juan, Miguel and the rest of the staff.

<Content>Great Location in Old San Juan My wife and I stayed there for two nights following a cruise out of San Juan. The location was ideal for touring Old San Juan and the price was right even in high season. It is an older building as you would expect in this location, the rooms were average as well as the amenities, but the staff was absolutely fantastic, treating us like family and cheerfully taking care of every request. The rooftop restaurant was an added bonus, with good food and good service. We would gladly stay there again if we return to the area. If you plan to walk around Old San Juan, and that is definitely the best way to see it, take a good pair of walking shoes...lots of up hill and down hill walking, but you can walk to absolutely everything...shops, the old forts, restaurants, the whole works. Overall, it was a great experience!

<Content>Pros and Cons We stayed at the Hotel Milano in Feb. 2007 - 1 night pre-cruise and 1 night post-cruise. The main advantage of the hotel, in my opinion, was its location. It was great to be within walking distance of so many of the sights in Old San Juan. Also, there is a free bus to El Morro, which we took advantage of while there. The hotel is also within a few blocks of 2 of the main cruise piers. Unfortunately, our ship departed from the third! However, it was a short taxi drive, and not a problem.We booked a room in the front of the hotel, as we had read that the rear rooms were smaller and some lacked windows that could be opened, which sounded a little claustrophobic to me. The room itself was quite adequate and clean, though a bit small, as we expected in an older hotel such as this. Our main problem was the noise from the street, which continued until 4AM both nights we stayed. Part of this was our own fault, as we left the windows open. However, the air-conditioner was just 'On or off' - with it off, the room was very hot, but with it on it was frigid - so we opted to leave it off. It may have helped with the noise to have the unit turned on, but I'm not sure we had enough blankets for that!The restaurant on the roof was very nice, although the views are not as scenic as the photos, as there is a lot of construction in the area. The food was good, and so was the service - so it was enjoyable. However, the complimentary morning breakfast was very minimal - beverages, packaged donuts, and boxed cereals. It was a start to the day, though - and we found several nice restauarants nearby for a more substantial meal.I would probably not stay here again, but I would recommend it to anyone wanting a reasonably priced comfortable room in Old San Juan. The staff is friendly and helpful, and it's a great location as a base for sightseeing.

<Content>Very disappointed We stayed for one night (on a Thurs) prior to our cruise. The best feature of this hotel is its location right in the heart of Old San Juan. It was within a few blocks walking distance of a great restaurant (The Parrot Club). However, the small size of the hotel means limited service in the event of problems. As we were getting ready for bed about 10pm, we noticed a leak from one of the ceiling tiles directly above the shower. The leak quickly became a steady stream, and the ceiling tile looked like it could give way at any moment, dumping who knows what on our heads in the shower. We contacted the front desk and the clerk on duty came up to examine. He said that the manager would be coming to speak with us about changing rooms, but we never did see the manager. And since it was so late, there was no maintenance person available. There was only one other room available which was smaller than what our cruise stateroom was! So at 11pm, we had to move all of our stuff down the hall to another room, in which we and our luggage barely fit. We were offered a reduction in our room rate. The continental breakfast was average. We were allowed to leave our luggage after checkout while we went on a walking tour of Old San Juan. The luggage was put in the main lobby hallway with a locked chain around it. Not what I was expecting when I had gotten confirmation that our luggage could be put in storage. I would not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Old world charm in Old Town We stayed at the Milano for 5 nights prior to a cruise and found it very suitable. The price is very reasonable and the Old Town location is fabulous. And we even walked with all our luggage to the pier! The hotel is small and quaint - very clean and staff offered wonderful, personal hospitality. Our room was small but comfortable and bathroom great! Breakfast on the roof terrace was delightful. Too bad a tall building is being constructed a couple blocks away which will destroy the nice view of the harbor. We read about the Milano in a NY Times travel review. Their web site showed they didn't have availability for the full length of our stay, but a direct call proved that it would be possible after all. It pays to call direct.

<Content>Excellent location and staff Six of us stayed there for 3 nights, January, 2007. The location in the heart of Olde Towne was very convenient. The hotel was well kept and the rooms were of average size and comfortable. We enjoyed the rooftop restaurant and the food and service was very good. We were there during the festival of St. Sebastion. Olde Towne was very crowded and the taxis could not come and go as customary, so that was a disadvantage. The staff went out of their way to accommodate us. Everyone from the front desk to the restaurant servers were helpful and friendly. (we could not get a taxi to take us to our cruise line so 2 of their empoyees loaded our luggage on carts and escorted us 5 blocks to our ship.) I hope to visit San Juan in the future and I will definitely stay at Hotel Milano again.

<Content>Great Hotel! We stayed in this hotel for 2 days post cruise and had a wonderful time! The location was fantastic in Old San Juan! It was within walking distance of everything! We could have walked from the cruise except uphill with all the luggage. The staff was courteous, the rooms were nice, and they had a small restaurant on the roof which was great! We stayed with 2 other couples and we will stay there again when we return to San Juan!

<Content>great location We were looking for a reasonably priced hotel in Old San Juan prior to taking a cruise. Hotels are few and expensive in this area. Our room was large and clean but very basic. I checked it out on TripAdvisor before making a reservation and made sure I booked a room on the front-more expensive but at least it had 2 big windows. Some of the rooms have tiny windows high up in the wall. Breakfast of cereal, toast, fruit, juice and coffee was included. If money was spent on upgrading it could be very nice. Of course it would then be more expensive! The location is great. Old San Juan is fascinating to explore with very good restaurants.

<Content>Great place in a great place A wonderful selection, not least because of its location in one of the most happening old neighborhoods in San Juan. No matter your interests, you will find them nearby. Milano itself is wonderfully managed, with very friendly staff, comfortable rooms, and (this was a must when I was there) air conditioning! Definitely a good choice.

<Content>Excellent choice We had a very good stay at the Hotel Milano. The price is the most reasonable we could find anywhere in the old city, and it really is in the heart of old San Juan within easy walking distance of everything. Our room was terrific, the staff was accommodating, the dining room was good, and we would stay there again anytime.

<Content>Great little hotel! We selected this hotel after seeing it in March, 2006 when some friends stayed there. We booked a room with two beds in order to have more room. It is in a great location. The hotel is small, which is what we liked. Nice clean rooms and quiet. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. There is a nice restaurant on the roof, with some tables outside. Good food and service. Breakfast was included in the price.We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Location is Key! I read the reviews here first and they are very accurate! If you want an economy hotel in the heart of Old San Juan within walking distance of the historic sites, numerous restaurants, shops, etc....this is it! Not a great hotel for kids though....not much for them to do and the kids TV channel was not working well.The room is small, and rather comfy. The bathroom is tiny. The main areas were not air conditioned except for the lobby. The room had A/C but only off or on! No temperature adjustment so it was either COLD, or HOT. I was sick so this created a problem for my chest cold. It is a bare bones, basic room. No frills here but it is clean and the maids are excellent! You may need to ask for washcloths (we had to).We only used the rooftop restaurant for the continental breakfast which consisted of toast, apples, bananas, juices, coffee, milk, cold cereal and some pastries. The view from the roof is not as beautiful as the pics on the site. There is a lot of construction going on and decrepit rooftops nearby.The streets and sidewalks are narrow and cobbled so wear sneakers....sandals may get you a twisted ankle. The area is very easy to navigate and the hotel is a 5 minute walk from the bus station to go to the other cities. We went to Condado beach. It was beautiful, clean, warm.....best part of the vacation. We went to El Morro, San Cristobal (forts), and the gardens of Casa Blanca. It was beautiful! Take sunscreen and water on these walks (within walking distance of the hotel)! Restaurants are plenty and very good! You must go to El Jibarito on Calle del Sol. Very tasty, inexpensive and local. We also tried Barrachina on Fortaleza St (same as Milano). Pricier but great food and service! Fri and Sat nights have a flamenco show there. See the Le Lo Lai show if you are there when it takes place. Ask the front desk cause this show travels and it is well worth it! Parrot Club Restaurant is also near Milano but it was a little more commercial, still good though. Cafe Puerto Rico is around the corner from Milano and has tasty appetizers.The wait for a bus can be 20-40 minutes but the rides are only 75 cents versus a $10-12 cab ride.Great location/convenience but if you want more style and ammentities, you may want to go elsewhere.

<Content>DIsco in Room The only thing good about this place is the location and price. I was traveling with a group of 3 so we needed a room with two beds. They gave us a room on the second floor with no windows; a cave like setting. I did not come for the room so I was fine with it. If you are going out in Puerto Rico and coming in late from partying, this is the place. I had an early flight and had to go to bed early though. The disco started around 11pm and progressively got louder. It was IMPOSSIBLE to sleep until after the disco closed. I complained and the guy downstairs walked over to the disco to have them turn it down. It did not help. Ask for a room away from the disco and it might be better.

<Content>Excellent Value in Old San Juan Right in the Heart of Old San Juan, the service at this hotel was amazing. Any directions or needs, the front desk bent over backwards.Room was nice, this is not 5 star, but for the money, service and location, it鈥檚 a great value.One recommendation is if you are staying there pre cruise, like we were, you get a room away from street. Friday night is Party Time in Old San Juan.Free continental breakfast included, don鈥檛 expect much, it鈥檚 free!!!

<Content>Great Deal This is a great deal in the heart of Old San Juan. We wanted to spend part of our stay in Puerto Rico in Old San Juan, and didn't want to break the bank. This place was a good find, and the price is great. The rooms are pretty standard. The location, however, turned out to be the highlight. It is on Calle Fortaleza, which is now considered the SoFo district of Old San Juan. This area is in the middle of all the action, with Calle Fortaleza being filled with great restaurants and bars for night life. We would spend the day exploring and sight seeing, head to the Milano for a quick shower, and we'd then have a whole host of options for dinner. The staff were nice and it was quiet. There is a rooftop restaurant (I think it was called 'Panorama') where you could sit for drinks and look out on the rooftops of Old San Juan. It's not the greatest view, but it was nice to sit there in the open air. Overall a great value if you want to stay in the middle of the action in Old San Juan.

<Content>great place i had read some negative things about this hotel after i had made the reservation, and also read some positive reviews. Well i decided to keep the reservation, and am very glad i did. My wife and i went on a carnival cruise out of san juan for our 30th wedding anniversary , and after the cruise we stayed 3 days at the Milano hotel, juan and the entire staff could not have been more friendly. From the time we walked in the door, until 3 days later when they called a taxi for us to the airport. The hotel is in the middle of old san juan, and is within walking distance to everything,. and if you dont want to walk, there is a free trolley stop in front of the hotel. The continental breakfast was great, and served at the top floor restaurant, which is another great place. My wife and i ate dinner there 2 out of the 3 nights we were there. If you are looking for a great hotel at a value, this is the place to stay. james garrison, tennessee.

<Content>Quaint, lovely Quaint little hotel in the heart of Old San Juan. Nothing special about the room, but it was clean, quiet, and comfortable. The location is wonderful though. We only had 24 hours in Old San Juan before flying to Culebra. This was the place to stay! It is within walking distance of every place we wanted to go.Sunday evening we ate at the restaurant at the top of the hotel.Bring a sweater or cover up. It was chilly but really nice. The food was good, too. Scenery is the best though. Have breakfast at Bonbonera (spelling?) I'm not much of a coffee drinker but it was the best coffee I've ever had. I could have sat all day and drank the stuff! The breakfast sandwich was delicious. It is a great little place to stay. Don't pass it up if you have the chance to stay.

<Content>Great hotel, wonderful staff! I can't say enough about the Hotel Milano. Nice, comfortable rooms, great location in Old San Juan and a wonderful, friendly and helpful staff. I left a camera in a shop down the street from the Hotel Milano. We didn't discover it until late Sunday and had to leave early (5:00 am) Monday morning. I spoke to the desk staff about my stupidity and they went the extra mile to check with the store later in the day, get my camera, and I had an email from Juan San Emeterio (the owner) asking where to send it the next day. I can't thank them enough!

<Content>Best Cheap Lodging in Old San Juan Hotel Milano is a steal. Located directly in Old San Juan, this property offers clean rooms, friendly staff, and a great location. When staying here, you are within 1-10 min walking distance of amazing restaurants, great shopping, and the cruise departure ports. We saved a lot of mony because we didn't have to take cabs or taxis to and from dinner. Yes the room provided the bare minimum but they are extremely clean. One aspect we were slightly unhappy with were the bed sizes. We got a queen sized bed--which was more like a full size bed. It was ok for a hotel bed--but I have definitly had a more comfortable sleep. But considering it's $50-150 less than the average Old San Juan hotel, I can handle it for one night. So if you are needing a room before or after your cruise or just want to stay in San Juan for one night this hotel is for you!

<Content>Great location After finishing our Caribbean cruise, we wanted a place to relax before heading home. We wanted a place that was centrally located in old San Juan. This hotel fits the bill perfectly. There are many shops and restaurants for blocks in any direction. Our room was spacious and clean. It was my husband's birthday, and the owner sent a bottle of wine to our room. They have a rooftop restaurant which offers a nice view, good food and drinks, and a wi fi connection.There is also a free trolley that takes you all around the town. You can get off wherever you want and then continue when ready.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be in the thick of things in Old San Juan.

<Content>Great Stay at Hotel Milano We had a great time staying at Hotel Milano. The price was great for the location. The Hotel is practically in the middle of Old San Juan. Doesn't take any time to walk anywhere. We felt pretty safe walking around all times of the day. Walked to both forts only went to San Cristobal Fort, worth the 3 or 5 dollars per person. Bring a camera. The rooms where a little small but clean. Had a room in the back away from the street since I had heard it gets loud at night. I did hear a lot of music around three o' clock am but they like to have fiestas' so what can you expect. Overall definitely recommend this hotel. Make sure to stop by at the roof top restaurant for at least a drink or two to take in the view; before the 12 story parking deck steals the view.

<Content>Great Alternative for the Business Traveler I've made this hotel my go-to place while in San Juan. If you're looking for a European-style hotel, walking distance to all the great Old San Juan restaurants, clubs and bars, very easy on the expense budget, with a great staff, wonderful bar/restaurant upstairs...this is the place for you. I quickly grew tired of the noisy casino hotels and find Hotel Milano to be more like a home than a hotel. It's a quick taxi ride from the hotel to the commercial center of San Juan. I encourage business travelers to stop by and check it out!

<Content>Good location, clean, secure and great Puerto Rican Cooking The Hotel is very well located. I loved my daily evening strolls to the harbour (about 4 mins.) to look at the gigantic cruise ships. The open plaza in front of Banco Popular is a must see on weekends. Local musicians, souvenir stands, horse carriage rides ... Within 100 yards from the Milano are many HIP restaurants, bistros and bars, the meeting place of the local Yuppie-Scene.All other tourist attractions of the Old City are within walking distance as well. Just remember to walk slowly and on the shaded side of the street in summer!This was my 3rd or 4th stay in the MILANO during the past 5 years. The staff was friendly as ever, the rooms clean and security good.The Panorama Restaurant on the top floor is one of my favourite dining places because of its tasty home style Puerto Rican Cooking and the good view. My favourites are the Churasco Steak and the Shrimps in spicy red souce (can't remember the exact name). If you are lucky you will meet the owner, Mr. Emeterio, an author and very interesting person to talk to.

<Content>Friendly, safe, perfect location! Hotel Milano's charm comes from its exceptionally friendly and helpful staff as well as it's central location in Old San Juan. I just spent eight days in that fascinating old city and headquartering at Hotel Milano was ideal.Many thanks to those who wrote reviews before me because they were the deciding factor in my choosing Hotel Milano for my stay. It's certainly not fancy but I found it to be clean, safe,convenient and affordable!Aloha,MaryMaui, Hawaii

<Content>Average hotel in a great location The hotel offered an average, clean room in a great location. The rooms are nothing to write home about, but everything in Old San Juan is easily within walking distance. Hotel Milano was a simple, clean place to rest your head after walking around all day...which is perfect! We stayed on the 4th floor in a room in the back so we had no problem with noise. Overall, I recommend it for location.

<Content>great location but dated rooms The location for this hotel is it's best selling point.It is in the heart of the restaurant and shopping area, and walking distance to the rest of old san juan.The lobby is very nice. The rooms are very dated, you must be prepared for that--worn carpets, old bedspreads--but clean. So don't go expecting more or you will be disappointed.The front room had a nice big window and was fine as far as noise since the a/c drowns it out. (ask for a/c controller at desk to adjust a/c, from room you can only turn it on and off)Staff was helpful and friendly. We were disappointed that the rooftop restaurant was closed for vacation so we didn't get to try it.If you're looking for elegance or romance, El Convento would be the place. If you're looking for a more reasonably priced place to lay your head, Milano is a good choice. ADVICE IN OFF SEASON-call before going to restaurants, many are closed, as was the Parrot Club, so you don't waste your time walking around town aimlessly!

<Content>Wedding Reception Hi:I had my wedding reception last May on this Hotel. The restaurant has a great reputation on the island and the view is great. No other hotel in Old San Juan has a restaurant on the top floor with that or any view. My guest said three things that made me feel great. Excellent food, great service and what a beatiful restaurant. I've stayed here more than once and the rooms are always extra clean and comfortable. We were on a budget because I was leaving for Europe the next day for two weeks so I didn't expect the service or any of the ammenities for what I payed.Thanks Hotel Milano!!!

<Content>Awesome Location! Definitely recommend to anyone who doesn't want to pay a ton for a great location. We recommend walking down a couple blocks and visiting the Parrot Club, which is amazing. The room was fine, nothing too extravagant, but still clean and nice. Keep your windows shut at night though, the nightlife is really loud. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. We stayed one night before traveling home and it was a perfect hotel for the end of our trip.

<Content>loved my room and the staff hospitality As a first time visitor to Puerto Rico I just want to say that my stay at Hotel Milano was very satisfactory and a pleasant experience. The accomodations were very affordable in comparison to other surrounding hotels. My room was very neat and clean and the staff very courteous and friendly. I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Puerto Rico who want to be centrally located in Old San Juan. They have a magnificent roof top restaurant with local cuisine dishes on their menu. I did not have to venture far for a great meal!Grace M.New York City

<Content>Nice people, great location Four nights at the Milano Hotel in old San Juan allowed me to see the sights. The best part of the hotel was the friendly staff. Everyone on the front desk was helpful!I was surprised that the cost to stay in San Juan was higher than I expected. My double room at the Milano was adequate and I took advantage of the 10% AAA discount. The Milano is in the heart of Old San Juan and the cruise ships dock a couple of blocks away. The best part of breakfast is the location on the roof of the hotel. Cold cereal, fruit, toast, juice, pastries, and coffee are standard every day.Old San Juan has its charm and the Milano is a reasonable alternative to the higher priced hotels.

<Content>Just this side of awful... The room was, in a word, depressing.Chipped and coming-apart formica furnishings. Bad smells in the elevator and the room (the room oder was masked by raspberry Renuzit, on full blast!) Stained carpet that was badly in need of a good vacuuming. Plastic plant on the table. Front desk clerk not particularly helpful and didn't even say hello when I came and went. Bathroom had new fixtures but was not too clean - someone else's hair on the floor and tile walls. Yuck.I have travelled many places in the world and this was the worst value hotel I have encountered anywhere. Period.

<Content>oh, oh Hello.Though so many good reputations about this hotel, I was disappointed about this. I just felt bad smell in my room,,,, and the sheets in the bed was a little bit wetty and dirty. The bathroom was not so clean as I expected and the outside noise kept me awake all through the night. The elevator was very slow and I just thought I was locked in (not actually) under the hot temperature. The view from the top roof is not so good cause now you can see the building under construction (also noisy). I could not stand this situation and changed the hotel the next day.

<Content>The Worst Hotel Experience EVER I missed my flight and had to stay over in San Juan. After traveling all over the world, I have never had a worse experience. The clerk was incredibly rude in all ways. No welcome, no hello....my room was hot and I asked if there was another room available and was told why dont you turn on the AC - was told that I was not the only one here and the elevator had an awful smell as did the room.

<Content>A good place to sleep in a convenient location This is an uninspiring but acceptable hotel in a great location. Old San Juan does not seem to have a lot of room offerings, so for the price, like the other reviews, Hotel Milano is a great deal. We had 2 parents and 2 kids in two beds on the top floor. Noise was not a problem, the room was clean and, once we got the A/C cranked up, comfortable.The LOCATION -- block and a half from the Parrot Club, Aqua Viva, Dragon Fly conglomerate. Very easy walking distance to all the San Juan sights. See El-Moro at night, and get lost among the colonial buildings and in the cobble-stone streets of Old San Juan. We never felt unsafe, but watch your belongings as Puerto Rico has a reputation for thievery. (Although in our two weeks throughout the island, we NEVER had anything stolen.)

<Content>location, location, location In the heart of Old San Juan, a short walk to just about everything. A number of highly rated and very good restaurants within 2 blocks and close to shopping, harbor and sights in this unique historical and totally fascinating area. We live in the French Quarter in New Orleans so we really appreciated being in the middle of Old San Juan. Hotel Milano is not fancy but very charming, comfortable, clean, well maintained, etc. Owner and the staff are very friendly and helpful. A simple, self- service breakfast as well as lunch and dinner are served in the Panorama Restaurant on the top floor. We had a very good meal there sampling some nice wine and Puerto Rican specialities. We were so glad we did not stay in the high-rise beach area as we would have been totally bored. It is easy to take a cab to the beaches for the day. We plan on staying there again in the future.

<Content>Convenient Location Hotel Milano is a historic hotel located conveniently in Old San Juan. We originally booked a standard room, but when we got there we were surprised that the room only had 2 small block type windows located just below the ceiling which were unable to be opened. It felt like we had walked into a cave. We immediately asked for another room, which was an upgrade, but well worth the extra $20. Apparently the front rooms have windows, but are on the front side of the building facing the street so reportedly have a tendency to be noisy. The noise was limited and really didn't bother us since we were in Old San Juan and some noise is to be expected. The service was definitely noteworthy. Miguel was extremely helpful on all levels from changing our room to helping us navigate around the city. Don't expect an extravagant breakfast, though. The included continental breakfast consists of a choice of white or wheat toast, apples or bananas, juice, and coffee. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a hotel with more character than the typical chain hotel and want to be located right in the heart of Old San Juan, Hotel Milano is definitely the place to stay.

<Content>Home away from home. Hotel Milano in Old San Juan was my home away from home. I started staying there after they opened. I spent at least one weekend a month there in the center of Old San Juan. The staff there treat you like family for your stay, no matter how long you stay. I just moved here to Old San Juan from a nearby island. All of the people that will by coming over to see me will be staying at the Milano as i have so many times before.

<Content>Hotel Milano was great! We stayed at the Hotel Milano in Old San Juan pre and post cruise in May 2006 and found it to be great. Juan (the owner) was quick to answer all emails and set up a reservation. The hotel is close to everything in Old San Juan and the rooms are very nice- good size, and everything works - the tv, ac, modern bath and refrigerator. Juan did promise a back room for both reservations and when we arrived for the second they gave us a front room and would not change it (Juan was not there at the time). Since it is on a busy street, the noise woke us up at 2:40 am that night. So we recommend insisting on a back room if you go to bed before that time!The free continental breakfast on the rooftop open restaurant is great - a good start to the day and a good view. Definitely would recommend this hotel and go back there any time.

<Content>Charming little hotel We stayed at the Hotel Milano in Old San Juan for 2 nightsin May and found it to be the perfect base for all the thingswe wanted to see in San Juan. The staff is very courteous and helpful, the rooms are spotless,and though they're not fancy, the rooms have nice little amenitieslike a small fridge with bottled water (not marked $3.50 a bottle,as in American chain hotels!). There is a very European feel to this little place that we felt at home in and loved. The included breakfast is a generouscontinental one -- very nice.A big bonus to staying at the Hotel Milano is that you are just1-1/2 blocks from 2 trolley stops, which means you don'tneed a car in Old San Juan (I can't imagine driving thosenarrow streets anyway!). The trolley is free and takes youto all the major historical sights in Old San Juan. Veryconvenient!Another bonus to this hotel is that some of the top restaurantsin all of Puerto Rico are within 2 or 3 blocks! We enjoyedAMAZING meals just steps from our rooms.Especially if you are mainly or solely interested in Old SanJuan and not so much the new part, Hotel Milano isa wonderful choice!

<Content>Best value as compared to others in the area. I attended a wedding in Old San Juan where guests stayed one of four places. For the price, you really can't beat Hotel Milano. As compared to the HoJo, the rooms were enormous and we had the luxury of a tub! Yes, the hotel is in the middle of the party district and we could hear the music until the wee hours of the morning, but it really wasn't that bad on the 3rd floor. There are four floors of rooms at Milano. The breakfast was just OK, but it was free; I'm not complaining. The rooftop restaurant lured other wedding guests more than once for the wonderful view. After eating at a variety of restaurants, I can honestly say that the hotel's rooftop restaurant has some of the best food in the city and, by far, the best pina coladas! Be sure to try the calamari, seafood paella, and cream soup, too. The location is wonderful as you are in walking distance from the harbor, historic fort, numerous shops... and the free trolly is just a block away on Fortaleza. The Hotel ElConvento and Intercontinental (on Isle Verde beach) were much more upscale, but three times the price. Email me with questions if you so desire. I'll post photos later on. Anita

<Content>A little gem in the heart of Old San Juan We stayed in a front large room for a pre-cruise night and really enjoyed our time at this charming little hotel. The place is spotless and the service was impeccable. On the morning we were supposed to get to the pier, we woke up to find out that taxis had just gone on strike (I think they went back before the day was over). The hotel arranged transportation for us within minutes at no charge. We enjoyed drinks at their rooftop restaurant and were able to meet and converse with other pre-cruisers. As for the street noise, yes it was there, but honestly, I think it added to the ambiance. Old San Juan is a cool place when the sun comes down.

<Content>We loved the Hotel Milano We stayed at Hotel Milano for 1 night before and after our cruise and enjoyed every minute of it! The staff is very friendly and helpful. I communicated with Sr. Juan in regard to the room and he was very helpful in setting up the reservation. The lobby has a lot of charm. The location was perfect and close to everything we wanted to see in Old San Juan. The view from Panorama restaurant was great too! As for our room, we had a front queen room. The room was very big and clean. The bed was comfortable too. As for the noise outside, it added to the charm of the hotel. It is close to the clubs and you can hear the beat of the music, the patrons, and the cars going by, but since we're from the city, it was like home. You can tune it out. If you are looking for silence, I say request a room in the back or stay elsewhere. If you are looking for a great hotel, with a wonderful staff, comfortable bed, clean room, and its centrally located, then this is the place! We'll definitely stay there again when we're in San Juan.

<Content>Great Little Secret We stayed for two days, March 25th and 26th, as a stop off before our cruise on Royal Caribbean. The hotel is right smack in the heart of Old San Juan, with wonderful restaurants and shops. We found that our room was clean and a very good value considering the alternatives. We were traveling with another couple who upgraded to a suite fronting on the road while we previously had read a TripAdvisor review and requested and got a room toward the rear of the hotel. Although our view was crappy, there was no noise of revelers on the street at night. Sheets were clean and the hotel staff takes pride in keeping their hotel spiffy. The hotel has a fabulous bar (hey guys, get some port wine next time, will ya!) on the roof top which gave one a view of the Old Town area and the sea in the disdance (harbor area). The front desk clerk was a bit of a sour puss, so management might want to entertain getting someone with a little personality. The porter was great...very helpful with luggage. I would defintely stay here again. The hotel has a restaurant as well, but we didn't try it. Although they serve a continental breakfast, it is a little on the cheapo side in terms of offerings, but at least it was something to get you going in the morning....

<Content>Noisy This is a nice small hotel in a very busy section of Old San Juan. Don't stay here if you want to sleep. The bar goers in the neighborhood party until 4 a.m., so be ready to be a night owl or stay somewhere else.

<Content>Loved the accomodations and meals This was our second stay at this lovely hotel. We were certainly very satisfied with the accomodations and meals on our first stay as we were this time around.Although this hotel is small in comparison to some of the other hotels, it is perfect for those who do not plan a vacation in Puerto Rico around staying in and around a hotel.Those who visit Puerto Rico should most certainly explore the island and all of its magnificent beauty as my husband and I try to do each time we visit. Thank you Mr. Juan San Emeterio for making our second visit to your establishment just as nice as the first.Mr.Mrs.M. Rivera Staten Island, NY

<Content>Not what it's cracked up to be ROOMSThe rooms are small, but functional. Once we realised that the smallest rooms didn't actually have windows(!), we moved to a back room. But this was little better than an airless hole with a very window with a view of a wall. The front rooms may be better, but at a price - and maybe even noisier.BREAKFASTThe rooftop terrace is a very nice place for breakfast. Just a shame about the level of service and quality of food at breakfast - though the bananas were very nice, and at least it was included in the room rate. But worse still - the use of styrofoam cups and plastic plates in what should be a nice hotel really spoils things.LOCATIONThe location is great - although they really should pedestrianise the street permanently. The traffic is horrid. And don't expect to get ANY sleep on a Saturday night until 5:30am - you're right in the heart of San Juan's party district.Overall poor value.

<Content>What a disappointment We came to San Juan 2 days before our cruise. This was the third time we have stayed in Puerto Rico, but the first time in Old San Juan. Although the location of the hotel is good, the service was less than satisfactory. I made a reservation 6 months before we left and called 3 times prior to confirm since the hotel would not send anything in writing. When we arrived, they messed up the reservation. Although we were given a so-called upgraded room, this took about 2 hours and was very stressful after a long flight. The rooms are spartan to say the least and although clean, are no great shake. The continental breakfast consisted of left-over food from 7-11 and was awful. The best that can be said for the staff, including waitstaff at the restaurant, was that they were civil. All things considered, My wife and I will go elsewhere next time.

<Content>The heart Old San Juan We would like to take this opportunity to thank Senor Juan San Emeterio for our wonderful stay at the Milano in Old San Juan. The rooms and the service provided by your staff for my family far exceeded our expectations. The location in the heart of the old city was certainly a plus with everything within a short walking distance. There is nothing that can replace old world charm. Again many thanks for your warm hospitality.

<Content>Great Location, OK room The Hotel Milano has an absolutely great location if you must stay in Old San Juan. It was a 5-10 minute walk to the ferry and a 15 minute walk to El Morro. A walk in any direction has interesting things to see and I felt safe walking at all times of the day. The rooms are pretty basic. You are definitely paying a premium for staying in Old San Juan. The free breakfast served on the rooftop consisted of cereals, bananas, juices and packaged sweet rolls. I was able to park on the street in front of the hotel...but I was very lucky in that regard. There is ramp parking near the water about 3 blocks away. The staff is friendly and helpful. I would only recommend the hotel if staying in San Juan is a must.....still I think the hotel offers good value considering the great location and other hotel prices nearby.

<Content>location, location, location Our family of 4 stayed at the Hotel Milano in Old San Juan Puerto Rico. It was wonderful. A perfect place when you are spending the day shopping and touring Old San Juan. Much less expensive than El Convento and right in the middle of Old San Juan. The room was great and the roof top bar was lots of fun. Security during daytime and night time is perfect. Our room faced the street, which was a bit party like till 4am on a Friday morning, but with the air conditioning on and the window closed, it barely proved a problem. If you wish, you could have a room at the back of the hotel with less of the outside noise. What we really loved about it was that during the middle of shopping, we were just a 5 minute walk away from our hotel. There are parking lots nearby to park your car, but as we had rented one for our trip, we left it at AVIS at the airport and took a taxi in. There is no or little street parking in Old San Juan and it is much easier to have a taxi drop you off and pick you up. We would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Wonderfull Again This was our 2nd.stay at the Hotel Milano and it was just as memorable as the 1st.Even though it's been almost a year since then it was like 'old home week'.The staff remembered us and welcomed us like family.The rooftop restaurant/bar has excellent food and the view over San Juan harbor is great! It's this hotel,the friendly staff,and the gracious gentleman that owns it that makes us want to return to Puerto Rico again and again!Viva Sr.Juan !

<Content>Enchanting! We had read reviews about the Milano, but only through experiencing the ambiance, the employees and other guests, will you truly enjoy the San Juan experience!!We arrived to find a very nice, CLEAN and well kept small hotel with smiling and helpful personnel. Our recommendation is the front, double/double room. You have a great view of the downtown of Old San Juan.The roof-top restaurant makes a wonderful place to start the day with breakfast or end the day with a wonderful dinner and drinks. The food was exceptional (people from other hotels were coming there to eat!). There was no rush and you were treated with warm smiles and happy voices.We throughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay there again during our worldly travels!

<Content>Good value, great location Hotel Milano is in an excellent location in old San Juan. It is just up the street from the Parrot Club and several other great restaurants and bars. The views from the rooftop dining area and terrace is spectacular. The staff is helpful and attentive. My messages via email were promptly and courteously returned by the owner of the Hotel Milano. And although my room had only a small window, I was made aware of this BEFORE I confirmed the reservation. Given the great price on the room, in Old San Juan, I took the room anyway. The rooms were clean, the bath room immaculate. I would recommend this for any person traveling to San Juan and wishing to stay in the most culturally favorful area, Old San Juan.

<Content>Hotel Milano San Juan - Decent Deal We stayed at the Hotel Milano for 1 night and booked the smallest room for $90, which has no windows. The room was clean and adequate. Probably wouldn't choose it for a longer stay. The bed was comfortable, there is a small fridge. The room truly is small, and the bathroom is even smaller. If you bend your arms at your elbows and stick them out they will touch the shower doors. That's how small it is. But again, very clean.The only problem we had was you couldn't control the temperature of the A/C. So you either froze if you kept it on at night, or sweated if you turned it off.Overall a decent hotel deal in the area. All other hotels were going for 3 times as much, as other reviewers have pointed out. It's in a great location, very convenient to walk around in Old San Juan. If you are only crashing for the night and set your expectations right, you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Exactly What We Were Looking For We found the Hotel Milano to be exactly what we were looking for. It is located in the middle of Old San Juan, so it was close to everything we wanted to see and do in the three short days we were there. It is (i) a block away from some of the finest restaurants in OSJ (don't miss a dinner at the Dragonfly (a block away) and don't leave the Dragonfly without having their Peking Duck Nachos (we had a fabulous dinner/evening here one night, meeting the wonderful couple seated next to us who were celebrating their 24th wedding anniversary), (ii) several blocks from the very trendy shopping on Calle Cristo (with plenty of jewelry stores in between), and (iii) the (6-hour) foot tour we mapped for ourselves turned out to be a wide circle around the hotel. The only transportation we had to hire was the bus to tour El Yunque 鈥?and we were picked up at the hotel. Although we heard one complaint from a guest, we found the boutique hotel charming. We had a room in the front -- it was clean, had two large windows, the air-conditioning was at a pretty comfortable level, room service was prompt and thorough, the staff was very, very helpful and friendly 鈥?and it was reasonable. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Clean, Simple and Affordable Accommodations A pleasant way to spend time in Old San Juan because of the central location. However, a bit noisy at night for sleeping. Nice interaction with staff and owner. It felt safe and was extraordinarily clean.

<Content>Excellent location for OSJ and Isla Verde Airport! We stayed at Hotel Milano January 27 and it was a great choice for our one-night stay, before going on to Vieques. The location is excellent for exploring OSJ and the best choice for its proximity to Isla Verde airport!Even tho the website said a minimum of two-nights, they allowed our reservation for just one night. I confirmed availability over email and we called in with our credit card over the phone. They were very responsive via email. When I wrote later for a recommendation for a nearby restaurant to celebrate my birthday, Juan extended a bottle of red wine at the restaurant at the top of the building. As mentioned, the breakfast was basic, but you can't go wrong with a little juice, fruit, toast  cereal to start the day!Our room was a rear, inside and it was a handicap room so the bathroom was large. I've seen other posts about inside rooms with no windows, but ours had three small ones. We, too, heard the thump, thump, thump of a nearby club during the evening. Had we not been so exhausted by our travel and walk around OSJ, we would have been THERE instead of tucked in for the night! So no complaints from us on that. The location was excellent and we were particularly pleased that is so close to Isla Verde airport. About a 10 minute taxi for $12. We paid $15 to get there from SJU.By the way, I highly recommend flying out of Isla Verde to Vieques or whatever other destination served from this airport. You can go to flickr and search for viequesairlink for a few photos from our flight--sorry we don't have any of the Milano!Wishing you safe and fun travel!!

<Content>Simple basic but great location We stayed in the Milano Hotel in Feb 2006.The hotel is in a very good location, central to everything that Old San Juan has to offer.On arrival at the hotel we had a lack lusture welcome(the guy would not get off the phone!).Our room we found to be very basic and I would think that the carpets would need a good cleaning.And as for view that we were promised, that was non existant , we were looking into the back of a building and the windows were so high up anyway!!But for the money it was worth it.There is wireless internet, but you have to go all the way up to the 4th floor restaurant to get any signal.The continental breakfast was a bonus and what you would expect really.All in all we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again .

<Content>Delightful Old San Juan hotel We have just returned from a cruise out of San Juan and had booked the Milano Hotel for 2 nights prior to boarding our ship.The hotel has great ambience-clean-large rooms-good air conditioning. Elevator to the 4th floor.It has a great restaurant on the 5th floor-we intended to just have one meal there but ended up having all our meals here.A great menu-interesting scenery-excellent food and delightful staff.Walk out the front door and there are neat shops where ever you turn. A very easy walk to the cruise dock with a little park almost under the bow of the cruise ship tied up.We found the San Juan people extremely polite-helpful-friendly never pushy.This hotel is NOT a Hilton or Sheridan but just a nice local older hotel that we would certainly return to and send clients to at any time.Our thanks to Juan for his E mails to us prior to arriving from chilly Canada.

<Content>Good for a short stay if you'll just sleep there We just came back from PR, we spent our first two days in Rincon, and then went to San Juan on a Saturday to meet up with friends for a day and a half (they were leaving on a cruise Sunday). We did not want to spend a lot of money for a hotel, since we knew we wouldn't be in the room at all. We had been told when we made the reservations that all they had left was one room with a full-size bed, on the smoking floor. We took it (after being assured that the room wouldn't reek of cigarettes), as we were really happy to have found this hotel for under $100 when everything else in San Juan was going for double. We figured for one night, we could deal with the full-size bed. After having stayed there, I feel one night is the most we could have dealt with. The room was clean, but it was very small, had no windows (they had not told us that), and the AC was weak. There was a hint of cigarette smell, but we didn't feel that it reeked. I am sure every room is different, though, and some probably do reek. So long story short, I have to say, for the amount of time we spent in the room, it was really nice when we checked out and only had to lay out $98. Would we go back? Only if we were facing a similar situation, and were going to use the hotel to sleep and shower. I do think it's probably better than some of the other inns and small hotels I read about.

<Content>very satisfied my husband and i stayed in the hotel for a night after our cruise. the hotel is updated, clean and the rooms are a decent size. the staff are very friendly and accomodating. the continental breakfast includes different cereals, fruit, bread, toast and juice, a lot more than i expected. the location of the hotel was perfect, right in the heart of old san juan. we just loved staying in the old city and really recommend it. everything to see in the old city is within walking distance. we must admit that the price is a bit high but after doing research we found that anything cheaper would of been disgusting and gross. any tours you would like to do can be booked at the front desk. taxi prices are fixed and its about $19.50 from the airport to the hotel (excluding bags)

<Content>A total disappointment Just got back from staying in Old San Juan for one night. Thank goodness we only stayed one night at Hotel Milano. I hated this place. My expectations weren't very high considering I got a rear facing queen room ($135 a night) but you wouldn't believe how disappointed I was. Location was great but the room was utterly undesireable. We walked in there and the room was very warm and the windows were these 2 blocks, maybe 10'x10'. The comforter was the same comforter that I had on my bed was I was 10 years old! After tinkering with the air conditioner a little bit we still couldn't get the room to a temperature we found comfortable. We slept with only a sheet because it was so warm in there. I would not recommend this hotel. We felt like we were staying in a prison.

<Content>Great Value but 4 Stars for value, 2 stars for comfort We stayed at the Milano for two nights on a weekend in Feb. '05. This hotel is a good value if you want to be in Old San Juan. The room was adequate and clean enough and you can't beat the price in Old town. The included breakfast was subpar (they were out of juice, bread, etc.) but we didn't stay there for that reason and there's lots of weekend street noise.Two things you should know:1. If you're not a smoker, make sure they don't put you on the smoking floor 'cause it reeks! They originally gave us a smoking room even though I specifically reserved 'non'. They did switch rooms for us but you should confirm this when you book and again just before arrival.2. This being San Juan on a weekend, there was a LOT of drunken street noise, sounds of bottles breaking in the street, horns and car alarms blasting, etc. until sometime after whenever the bars closed. Ask for an inside room if you want to sleep!

<Content>Great value, outstanding staff - seek out the owner! If you are looking for luxury accommodations, look elsewhere. If you want to support a boutique urban hotel that has heart and soul personified by the charming owner - Juan Emeterio, then this is the place for you in Old San Juan.Emailed the hotel giving them a heads up it was a special trip (10th wedding anniversary and wife's birthday). Juan took the initiative and arranged for a lovely dinner at the rooftop restaurant, complete with wine and a very nice chocolate cake brought in from outside. Juan also joined us 鈥?both the food and the company were treats.Juan can often be seen loading luggage for guests or at the front desk helping out when the staff are busy. Very nice to see this kind of personal touch, so rare today.The rooms are comfortable, convenient to everything. It _is_ an urban hotel, so depending on your location, you may hear things from the street at night - that to me is part of the charm.I get to travel all over the world on business, and will always seek out places like Hotel Milano whenever I can. Juan is a big part of that. Ask for him and say hello if you can - you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Good for singles I traveled solo to San Juan in November and stayed at the Milano. The staff was helpful and very accommodating making good suggestions for sightseeing and shopping. The location in Old San Juan is convenient to shopping and restaurants. I enjoyed the hotel's restaurant, and I didn't have to spend taxi fare to leave the area in search of other dining options. The ferry to the Bacardi Museum is in walking distance, and the bus terminal for buses to the Condado, Ocean Park area is nearby as well. The hotel is clean, comfortable and a good choice for a single lady traveler. I recommend it!

<Content>Great Value for Money Just back from a Thanksgiving break. Everything the others say are true: very helpful staff, excellent location, very clean etc. The hotel rooms are throwbacks to the 80's and furnishings are in need of upgrades. That said, it's a great value for money at $135/night in the heart of Old San Juan!We went to El Convento for some pre-dinner drinks - got to experience this wonderful hotel but not pay the high price for it.

<Content>Little Jewel in Old San Juan Hotel Milano is a terrific find-it's small  quaint, with lots of character  very economical. Located so conveniently in the center of Old San Juan, the shops, restaurants and sites are all within walking distance, so you never have to deal with cars, cabs, traffic, etc. The free trolley travels along Fortaleza street right in front of the hotel and is easy to catch.The rooftop restaurant is particularly nice in the evening with a view of the bay.We loved Hotel Milano  plan to return whenever we go to Puerto Rico.

<Content>Had a Wonderful Time at Hotel Milano We recently spent a few days at Hotel Milano and were well taken care of by Juan San Emeterio and his staff. The hotel is in a beautiful old building. The rooms are not lavish, but comfortably furnished (we came to see Old San Juan, not a hotel room). More important, to me at least, the rooms were immaculate. I've stayed at many large chain hotels that weren't kept as clean as the room here was. We had a wonderful dinner at the Panorama roof top restaurant, and we enjoyed the mornings we went up there for the continental breakfast (the only downside to the continental breakfast is that you would miss going around the corner to Mallorca for breakfast). The hotel is conveniently located to all of the sights and experiences of Old San Juan. San Cristobal is just a short walk from the hotel. El Morro is a little further away, but can be walked. If you want to shop, there are plenty of opportunities (talk to the staff at the front desk they'll tell you who to talk to in some of the stores). The hotel staff was helpful recommending dinner suggestions (there are some great restaurants nearby - though do eat at the hotel too), and in setting up additional travel arrangements to see other parts of Puerto Rico (a trip to El Yunque, transportation to Fajardo). On my return to Old San Juan (which hopefully will be soon) I will return to Hotel Milano.

<Content>Hotel Milano - a wonderful find We were pleased with Hotel Milano, a small boutique hotel in Old San Juan.([--] Rooms are simple, clean and reasonable, $95 including tax with a 10% AAA discount for a queen including generous continental breakfast. There is a nice roof top restaurant with excellent typical food, view of the harbor, and lots of atmosphere at night. The staff was extremely helpful.Its central location is a plus. You can easily walk anywhere in San Juan from there. There are many restaurant right around it. We would definitely return here.

<Content>delightful ambience We recently spent six days in Old San Juan and staying at the Milano made it particularly pleasant. If you like fine old hotels, this is your cup of tea. It is well maintained, offers continental breakfast on the rooftop restaurant from which you can see the port of Old San Juan. It is convenient to reasonable parking (and on-street parking for the diligent) and a perfect starting point for strolling around the old city, which is a delight to the eye.It is also convenient to the cruise ship facilities.Concierge staff was helpful and professional. There was some spiritually uplifting material available in the room for the guest so inclined; for us it added to the pleasing atmosphere.

<Content>Great location, fine room The location of this hotel is really what makes is great. We were right in the middle of Old San Juan, just up the street from several fantastic restaurants. The rooms were basic, but clean and comfortable. The air conditioning in the room was either on or off so it got pretty chilly at night, but that didn't bother us too much. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was also basic, but satisfying and we were thankful not to have to pay for breakfast somewhere else. Overall, I would definitely stay there again as it was a bargain compared to other places near there.

<Content>A great small hotel We stayed at the Hotel Milano twice, for three days at the front end and a day at the back end of a Caribbean cruise, and loved it. We wanted to stay in Old San Juan for the sightseeing, colors, and history, and were glad to find a small, local, friendly hotel right in the heart of it all. Hotel Milano's location in the middle of Old San Juan was perfect--everything from historical sights to night clubs and great restaurants are within easy walking distance. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful, the rooftop restaurant is comfortable, and the food is good. We had a front room overlooking Forteleza Street, which was just fine, ample but not luxurious. This is not a chain hotel, which we try to avoid on trips, and we were glad to find a small, friendly, locally owned and operated hotel in the heart of everything. Hotel Milano fit the bill for us, twice. Old San Juan really rocks until the very wee hours on weekends, so some may find the noise from nearby clubs bothersome, but we didn't mind. In fact, one of the waiters in the restaurant was so friendly and nice to us that he asked us to join him and his girl friend for a night out at a really great night club after he got of work! You'd never find that at a big chain or resort hotel. Would I stay there again? Without a doubt and with no misgivings.

<Content>Beyond the call of duty! We had stayed at the Hotel Milano in Old San Juan several times. We became acquainted with Mr. Emeterio, the owner, and had spent some time with him in his hotel restaurant on the top floor overlooking the bay. It was a memorable experience.My family and I had decided to organize a banquet to honor my mother in her old age. She lived in Arecibo, Puerto Rico at the time. Because of logistics and family considerations we decided to have the banquet in Orlando, Florida. I did not know, (from the state of Texas where we live), how we were going to have my (wheel chair) mother travel to Orlando with her husband (asthmatic) without some very personal assistance. I decided to call Mr. Emeterio of the Hotel Milano because I just did not know who to turn to.What an awesome decision that turned out to be! We were just astounded at the intense personal interest Mr. Emeterio expressed and how he engaged the whole situation. He employed his staff and his personal driver to have our mother and her husband transported from Arecibo to Old San Juan, put up in his hotel overnight for rest, provided them personal room service, and the following day had them taken to the airport, take care of their paperwork and arranged to have them wheeld to the plane. This is what I call: Beyond the call of duty!.My sincere thanks to Mr. Emeterio and his staff for superior personal service. We will never forget it!tony  anna vera, dallas, texas

<Content>Great Location, Well Run Hotel The hotel Milano is the least expensive hotel in Old San Juan. It is quiet, has an excellent roof top restaurant and is well-maintained. It鈥檚 in a great location to enjoy the delights of Old San Juan. The rooms are small but quite adequate 鈥?ours had a view of an airshaft but it was clean and comfortable. If you enjoy Old San Juan the way it should be enjoyed, you will spend very few conscious moments in your room. We plan to return.

<Content>Great Choice I stayed one night in the Hotel Milano before going on a cruise out of San Juan. For this purpose my selection was a great one. The location in Old San Juan was perfect for walking around this area. The staff were super nice, the hotel was very clean and the crowning touch was dinner on the roof-top at the Panorama Grill. What a fabulous (and reasonably priced) meal! My room was a small, inside one which was okay for one night, but if staying longer I would opt for a larger room. However, I couldn't beat the price--$72 (plus tax) using my AARP deduction. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a small boutique hotel right in the middle of Old San Juan.

<Content>just what i needed I am currently looking over the balcony at san juan and the cruise ships, listening to some great music in the Panorama bar. Hotel Milano has been a wonderful week. HANDS DOWN I will stay here again if I am visiting Puerto Rico. The staff has been more than friendly (we have dropped off our laptops to the front desk every morning, and every afternoon when we walk back in they hand it to us with a smile). housekeeping has been amazing, I asked for a couple more towels and she actually went to the dryer and got me fresh hot ones instead of the ones that were folded on her cart. And even the owner Juan has been amazing. Would not expect to see him working the front desk, but there he has been. I honesly have no complaints about this place. you read here that some people comment that the staff isnt friendly (they are) or that its to loud (it isnt, but if it is, its becuase you are in old san juan.). and if there is a problem, talk to Juan or anyone else. If you are looking for a nice comfortable hotel in the middle of san juan, with clubs and bars withing stumbling distance, this is the place to go. if you are looking for a place in old san juan, with historical monuments within walking distance, this is the place to go. If you are looking for a place with a bunch of rude faceless employees, a manager who just takes your money at check in, that you will end up paying 200 a night for, this is not the place to go. I was worried when i saw the price, trying to figure out how it can be nice and cheap. its cuz its comfy. the bed was nice, the water was hot, and the mini fridge was great (could use a few microwaces in the halls somewhere, thats about it) and you are getting MORE than you paid for. this type of boutique would run you a mint in the states. only thing, if you want to go to the beach, make sure you walk the half-mile to the bus stop, this is Old San Juan, not Isla Verde or the other beaches. This is historical and party. I love it, and will be coming back again and staying right here.Make sure while you are here, you talk with Juan. Wonderful guy, and read some of his stories (they are in each room).

<Content>The Personal Touch This family owned hotel is the PERFECT place to be if you want to spend quality time in Old San Juan. It is located right in the heart of the city. From the hotel, you can walk in any direction and find food, museums, shopping, and historical sites. Juan, the owner, has hand picked each of his staff. The Panorama restaurant on the roof of the hotel has excellent food.We were surprised by how quiet the hotel was considering that it is located in the heart of the old city. Worth every penny and some!

<Content>A Sleepless Night in San Juan I honestly can't see why this hotel has gotten such great reviews. It was the right location - in the heart of Old San Juan and up the street from some fabulous restaurants (try Aguaviva!) - but the rooms are dingy and run-down, and all the rooms in the front of the hotel are directly above a pounding disco. It got started around 11pm and didn't stop until well after 4am - we know because it kept us awake the entire time. As for the rooftop restaurant, the food was merely okay, and service was quite poor. The view was mainly of a coal hill across the harbor. Next time, I'll try another location in Old San Juan.

<Content>A lovely visit We arrived to be greeted by the desk as though we were family. A quick trip to our room and the bellman brought our luggage. Friendly and effecent is the proper description for the staff. The rooftop resturant excelled in many ways compared to other resturants in Old San Juan. We dined several nites there and were shown respect and served well. Sr Juan San Emererio, when he found we were celebrating our 2nd anniversary, bought a round of drinks for our table. A kind and gracious host! Though the hotel is a few years old our room was clean and well kapt. the halls also kept neat and clean. Slow elevators only added to the atmosphere of the hotel. Our thanks to Migal and the rest of the staff for a Wonderful visit.

<Content>Great treatment, accomodations at Hotel Milano The day we arrived for our honeymoon, planning to spend a night in Old San Juan's Hotel Milano before catching our cruise ship, I left my camera in the cab.The man at the desk very kindly took our stub (hotels are arranged for by a central dispatcher at the airport), got the name of the cab company and contacted them, assuring us he'd do his best to get it back and suggesting we enjoy our limited time in Old San Juan.We checked into our room. No view but clean, with a porter taking our bags. The porter was every bit as considerate and positive as the man at the desk, and wished us a good day.The cabbie returned the camera to the airport, we were happy to find out from the man behind the front desk later that day when we returned. We were thrilled when the man called the airport for us and asked for the camera to be dropped off at the hotel, and they agreed.We took off for dinner and a walking tour of downtown, the waterfront and the information/free rum drink(s) center, and returned to have our camera back!Not only were the room clean and the sheets soft, the air conditioning was blasting cool air out by the time we got in. So much so, we had to turn it down in the middle of the night.The Milano staff considerately suggested tours we might like and assured us it was safe to walk throughout old San Juan, which it proved to be. The next morning we enjoyed the continental breakfast in their rooftop restaurant, enjoying great views of water, a cruise ship in harbor and the rooftop life of that gorgeous, vastly restored and colorful city.I can't say enough things about the impression the employees and accomodations made on me. The closest thing to a negative I can come up with is that there's was no view from our room, just walls of nearby buildings.When we were ready to leave, the morning lobby staff volunteered to chain our bags after we checked out, to make the most of our last few hours before catching the cruise ship. We took advantage of the offer and came back to find our bags safe and sound, and headed off to our honeymoon cruise!A room with a queen size will cost us $85.50 plus $77.0 room tax. Well wortht, too!

<Content>Undeserved Hype - this is like a budget Holiday Inn! I honestly don't understand how this hotel has received such glowing reviews. This hotel is on par with what you would expect if you paid $39.99 for any roadside hotel in the US. Actually, maybe not even that decent.When we stayed at the Hotel Milano it was very hot outside. The lobby felt great; the A/C was on high. However, when we got to our room we realized that the only place in the building with constant A/C is the lobby. The rest of the hotel was very hot and stuffy. Each room has its own A/C unit, but ours was just moving around hot air until we called down to complain. In response to our call, the man at the front desk said he would send up a remote that would make the room cooler - well, he did just that! We had to walk to the elevator closest to our room, and when the doors opened, there lay the remote, by itself, on the floor of the empty elevator. We had to use that remote to make our A/C blow cold air, and then ship it back down to the front desk using the same empty-elevator technique. Hardly 4 star service! And at that our room was still not as cool as we would have liked.Aside from that, the alarm clock is bolted down to the bedside table as if theft is a regular occurrence, the bathroom is 100 degrees since there is no central air, and the street below is noisy - we heard people partying until 3 am outside. The breakfast the next morning is free, and the rooftop deck area is pretty. But the free breakfast, again, is basic at best. Cereal that you eat directly from the plastic container, juice, toast you can make yourself if you choose to, and oranges, apples and bananas in a bowl. Sufficient, but definitely not excellent or above average - I honestly have no clue as to how a hotel that charges almost $100/night in the middle of hurricane season gets such great reviews for such lousy services and accommodations.

<Content>Loved it! My husband and I stayed at the hotel for only one night, but we were in Old San Juan for two whole days. We were staying there before our cruise left out that Sunday evening. While there, the concierge was very helpful since I left my backpack, which included my purse, in a taxi on the way to the hotel. The concierge tracked down the driver of the taxi and the driver curteously returned my bag without anything missing. The rooms are small, nice, and very cozy. We stayed in the queen size room facing the street. In the morning, there was a nice sit down breakfast served on the top floor of the hotel. I would definately recommend it to anyone who visits San Juan. The hotel is out of the way of the hustle and bustle of the traffic near the airport.

<Content>A Jewel of a Hotel The Hotel Milano is a particularly beautiful,charming hotel. Especially enjoyable was the rooftop restaurant with its unparalleled views. And, the Hotel's location in historic Old San Juan is the perfect setting.Moreover, every one of the Hotel employees with whom I had contact could not have been more polite, more helpful, more professional. They made me feel not only that I was a valued guest, but that I was, also, among friends. The Hotel Milano is truly a jewel, truly a gem, and I look forward to my return.

<Content>Wonderful little hotel We stayed here at the beginning and ending of our cruise (2 nights before and 1 after) in August 2005. It was the perfect location to launch a walking tour of Viejo San Juan (the old city.) The hotel was always close and provided a welcome respite from the heat and humidity. The room was pleasant, the staff was very friendly and helpful, and the complimentary continental breakfast was served on the top floor dining room, whose patio had a marvelous view of the bay. This hotel is not very far from the airport, about 15 minutes, and the price of the room was very reasonable compared to fancier ones in the area. We loved being able to walk along the city wall at night and join in the festivities with many of the local residents, who seem to come here on weekends to stroll the streets, enjoy the music and taste the local treats. It was also close to the ferry, which took us to Catano and Hato Rey for a view of the bay. We would definitely come back here for our next trip to San Juan.

<Content>Hospitality at it's best This hotel was highly recommended to me by a friend. My family and I stayed on the night of August 2, 2005, the first night of our vacation from Miami, FL. The rooms were nice, spacious and the rate was excellent. The hotel is in a great location, right in the middle of Old San Juan with restaurants, shops and the Fort within walking distance. The staff was extremely friendly and courteous. I also met the owner who welcomed me with a smile and had the pleasure of shaking his hand. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to San Juan.

<Content>Hospitality at its Best!!! This review is long overdue since I visited the lovely Milano Hotel in June. Unfortunately, due to illness I have not been able to write this review sooner. But, it does not diminish the great experience I had while I stayed at the Milano. From the moment that I arrived unexpectedly late one evening (the hotel I was supposed to stay at originally did not have the accommodations it advertised) until I left, the Milano Hotel owner and his lovely staff treated me as one of their own. My frustration in having to change hotels late in the day was quickly replaced (when I arrived at the Milano) to relief when I was shown to my clean, comfortable and cool room. The desk clerk gave me a warm welcome, the staff were all friendly and helpful, and the restaurant on the top floor was wonderful! The restaurant is a lovely place that affords one a wonderful view of old San Juan and the bay, while also providing great food and great service that can be enjoyed on the outside patio of the restaurant or in the comfort of the air conditioned restaurant area.Centrally located in old San Juan, with a lovely European-style lobby and personnel with great customer service attitudes make this hotel a wonderful and reasonably priced deal! The room is always clean, and the hotel owner was great to talk to! It was clear to me that the hotel owner is a hands-on manager who has high quality standards for his establishment and expects great customer service from his staff.Consistency in cleanliness, friendliness and customer service at a reasonable price is what you will find. My gratitude to the hotel owner and his staff for taking such good care of me! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there and recommend it highly.Ana Le贸nOrlando, Florida

<Content>Home away from Home Our recent trip to San Juan was ever so special because of the wonderful experience we had at the Milano. The room was quite spacious and exceptionally clean. We loved having breakfast and an evening nitecap in the rooftop restaurant overlooking the quaint city of Old San Juan. The best of all was the hospitality we received by all the employees. It was like staying with family. We will certainally stay again on our next visit to Puerto Rico. Next time hopefully we can stay a week instead of just a few days. Cudos to all who made our visit so wonderful.

<Content>A Small, Lovely Place in a Lovely City The perfect no-frills hotel right in the middle of Old San Juan, Hotel Milano is located on Calle Fortaleza, within walking distance to everything. You can see the entire old city in one day by foot, two days if you must go down every little winding cobblestone street, like I do. I stayed in a small room facing Fortaleza Street for $125 per night in July, which is off season. This is what I got for my money: air conditioning, a large window, cable TV, a small refrigerator, plenty of closet space, a bathroom with shower stall and a queen bed. The hotel restaurant is on the rooftop and overlooks the city and the bay. All guests are entitled to a free continental breakfast. You can get rooms with smaller beds, without windows or with windows facing the back of the building for amounts ranging from $80 to $115 off season. I found the staff to be very friendly and considerate. There is some room for improvement, however, and I have the following suggestions for the management:1) The lighting in my room was poor. It was difficult for me to read in bed or anywhere in the room, and I love to read. The four lamps had bulbs which gave poor light, and there was no overhead light. 60 watt bulbs (frosted) should be used in all lamps. 2) The air conditioner has no temperature control. In the on position, the room became quite cold. I had to shut the air off and on constantly to control the temperature. 3) The lobby is freezing. I find this to be a problem in many hotels, not just this one. Although I was in San Juan in July, it did rain, and sometimes the weather was warm, not exceeding hot.

<Content>Clean, affordable rooms. Honest and courteous staff. We stayed a night at the Hotel Milano on our way to the British Virgin Islands. The room was clean and cool (important for June in the Caribbean). We had dinner at the hotel's rooftop restaurant. The view was great, there was a nice, cool breeze and the food was good.We left a camera in our room and realized it while we were at the San Juan airport. We called the hotel and asked them if they had the camera, and they did. They said they would mail it to our home. It actually made it home before we did. We sincerely appreciate the Hotel Milano's professionalism in dealing with our camera that we left behind. The hotel is in the heart of Old San Juan. It was convenient to shopping and site seeing. It is also convenient to night life. I read that Puerto Ricans love the nightlife and I can confirm from hearing the nightlife well into the morning that this is true. Again, I appreciate the professionalism of the staff at the Hotel Milano. I would stay there again.

<Content>Perfect Place to stay!!! I just went to Puerto Rico and had the best time ever. For what I payed for this Hotel I was expecting a dump, but I was so pleasantly surprised, it was pretty and very clean and everyone was great. Check in was a breeze with no problem and our room was great. If you are like me and like to be out doing fun stuff this is the place to go. It is the middle of old San juan, which is gorgeous, it is walking distance from everything. Senor Frogs is right around the corner and so are 25cent bus rides to go anywhere. The staff at this Hotel know all the great places to go and help you get there. The tour guide(Peter at Eco Tours) we went with came right to the door to pick us up to take us to the rainforest, snorkelling, cruises, and don't miss the luminescent bay at night! If you are looking to have a good time this is the Hotel to go to. Our flight didn't leave until 12 at night and they were nice enought to hold our bags all day so we could enjoy the day. I'm definitly coming back.Thanks for the memories!Mrs. LeFave

<Content>Smart Choice What the Hotel Milano lacks in luxury it makes up for in location. I stayed in room 406. Our room was located in the front of the hotel. We rarely heard any noise from the street and considering there are a number of bars and clubs in the area not to mention the port, I was pleasantly surprised.Our television had HBO and a number of other english speaking channels as well as spanish. I didn't take advantage of the free continental breakfast, but the one time I went up to purchase a cafe con leche it was given to me on the house. Our room was clean, our bathroom spacious and we had a refrigerator. If you're the type of traveler who isn't hung up on bells and whistles, I would suggest the Hotel Milano. I know I'll stay there again.

<Content>Unexpected pleasure in the heart of Old San Juan If you want to stay in a small boutique hotel in the heart of Old San Juan, the Hotel Milano is the place for you! We only stayed a day or so before we boarded a cruise (a short taxi ride away), but really loved being able to walk around, come back for a cool rest or drink, go back out, etc. The rooms aren't overly glamorous, but they're definitely fine. We were in an inside room, which I think might be better because of city night noise (bars, etc.). With the tall ceiling and little ventilation window, it didn't seem inside at all. The best part is the roof-top restaurant bar. Very relaxed; we would go up there just to sit, or maybe order a drink...or have a whole meal. Whatever we wanted to do was fine with the staff. The whole hotel just has a lot of character, the owner is a fascinating person to talk to, the mini-grand lobby is a wonderful eclectic mix of classic elements, modern art and relaxed Puerto Rico. If this is the kind of place you're looking for, you'll like it.

<Content>A Perfect Stay The staff works very hard to make sure that everything is perfect. This is a small boutique-like hotel where rooms are VERY clean, simple and quite comfortable. The location cannot be beat. Views are only available from a few rooms (we stayed in one) but it doesn't matter since Old San Juan is right out your door (this hotel is in the heart). Simple continental breakfast with a beautiful roof top dining area. Big bathroom and a refrigerator. Would love to see a safe in the room. Very accomodating and pleasant staff. We would stay there again...

<Content>Convenient Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Milano. This is one of the better hotels in Old San Juan because it is close to everything. We went there on our honeymoon. The accommodations were well taken care of. All of the staff was exceptionally nice. Everything was in walking distance which made this the ideal place to be. They were able to book us an excursion to the El Yunque Rain Forest that picked us up and brought us back to the hotel. The tour guide was friendly and knowledgeable. Our room was on the second floor in the front. There was some noise on the weekends but that was expected for being in that part of the district. The pictures of the roof-top restaurant on the hotel's website are real. What a beautiful view of the harbor! We enjoyed our time there in spite of the little noise we experienced. We recommend this hotel to anyone going to Puerto Rico and staying in San Juan.

<Content>a treasure! This hotel is so lovely! It is small enough to make each guest feel important. Besides the perfect location, in the very heart of historic San Juan, the rooms were clean and restful.The restaurant on the top floor was my favorite place to eat in Puerto Rico! The outside section of the restaurant is covered and spacious and has a great view of the harbor. The food and service were flawless. I remember every meal as an event!The owner ,Mr. Juan San Emeterio, is an exceptionally gracious host whose intent is to create an elegant and personal experience for each guest.

<Content>Hotel Milano...a special place A perfect location for visiting this charming, exciting, historic town. From the roof top restaurant ....the breeze, the morning sun, watching the cruise ship, to the friendly, helpful staff and the nice rooms, the Hotel Milano was our perfect home in Old Town. We loved getting to know the owner, Juan. We agree with the positive letters posted. We highly recommend this small, intimate hotel. Sue and Jerry Johnson, Seattle, Washington

<Content>Decent Hotel, Great location I was a little nervous about the Hotel Milano after seeing some of the negative reviews, but we had a great experience! The room was just fine- spacious enough, small windows, strong A/C, clean. Basically, it's all about location! You really can't beat it- it's central to everything. A couple of times, we forgot things while sightseeing, and all we had to do was trot back to the hotel, and ten minutes later, we were on the go again! The rooftop restaurant is pretty subpar though- have a drink up there for the view, but don't waste your money on the entrees. really, it's kind of a rip-off. We decided to eat there because we were dead tired- but I definitely would not do so again.

<Content>San Juan's Goodwill Ambassador ! ! April 25-2005This is a follow up review to our previous pre-review ( see below ) of our stay at Hotel Milano in San Juan Puerto Rico.If there is one hotel that deserves recognition as the  Goodwill Ambassador  to San Juan, it is the management and staff of Hotel Milano in Old San Juan. ( Note to the San Juan Tourist Office; please make a well deserved notation on your files regarding Hotel Milano )From the moment we checked in, the welcome, the rooms, and the overall impression and location of this hotel gives you the feeling of care and appreciation for their guests.We stayed for 2 nights on two different weeks and it felt like  home . From the reception, the spacious rooms, dinner under the stars at the 5th floor restaurant/patio, it was an absolute delight.

<Content>a hidden delight! We just returned from a 7-day vacation in Puerto Rico. What a pleasant surprise we experienced! We made the choice to stay in Historical Old San Juan. We found this wonderful small hotel called Hotel Milano right in the middle of the city. The price was right, the rooms were comfortable and very clean, the staff was professional and vey accommodating, the food from their own 5th floor resaurant with harbor views was superior and the bonus was their little surprising specialties that they would make for you. We were able to walk to all points of Old San Juan from this hotel and enjoy the sights, the shops, the art galleries, other restaurants and not have to walk for miles to get back to our room. I wish we had found this place sooner. Old San Juan is like a city in old Spain re-created.We were fearful of the potential disappointments and the disasters that some experience with vacations, but this was a pleasant stay and most certainly a hidden delight just waiting for those looking for such a romantic little spot in this planet. Von voyage! From Dallas.

<Content>Good choice in Old SJU I stayed two nights at the Milano 31 March-2 April. The hotel is very centrally located with nothing more than a ten to fifteen minute walk; the staff were friendly and helpful. While not a luxury property, it is a good choice for anyone on a budget or who enjoys a smaller hotel. Fortaleza at night is truly noisy; a room in the back will help if you are a light sleeper.Complimentary continental breakfast (fruit and cereal) is served every AM in Panorama, the hotel's rooftop restaurant; lunch or dinner is reasonable and easy if you're in the hotel and a little too tired to hit the hotspots down the street.

<Content>Convenient hotel, friendly, helpful staff, however... We spent two nights here, Monday and Good Friday. Overall, the hotel is clean, safe, very friendly, helpful staff. However, if you want to sleep at all, do not accept a room facing Calle Fortaleza or what they call a front room. The traffic runs right underneath your window, backs up at all hours of the night with horns blaring and such, due to bars and night clubs in the area (one way street leaving Old San Juan just under your window). The noise was not from night clubs, just people out and about. The restraurant on the 4th floor, called Panorama was not too great. I've had worse, but it was expensive and not very flavorful. So many close places within walking distance, but none were open on Good Friday.I would definitely stay here again, with a room not facing the street. You can't beat the convenience to everything, and the price when compared to other hotels in Old San Juan, can not be beat. I felt perfectly safe at the hotel and walking to nearby restaurants in the evening with my husband and yound daughters.

<Content>Our favorite hotel in San Juan We have spent a week at Hotel Milano every yearfor the past 4 years. It is small but clean and verywell run. It has a pleasant rooftop restaurantand bar, the Panorama, with good food, drinksand a great view.The location is excellent for several of Old SanJuan's best restaurants, bars and sightseeing, someof which are just a block or two away..Rooms facing Fortaleza St., can be noisy, butthey are larger than the rooms in back.This year, (March, 2005), we had the pleasureof meeting owner, Juan San Emeterio, andenjoyed our conversation with him.

<Content>nice but don't expect charm if this were a cheap hotel it would be a different story. but it's not. so you should know to expect strange oriental pictures with clean and simple rooms. there is nothing carribian or spanish-looking in the hotel, and absloutly no old town charm. but the location works. you could do worse.

<Content>avoid a room overlooking Calle Fortaleza I agree with every positive remark made about this hotel. It is a great value, the staff is very friendly and the location couldn't be better. I did not heed the warnings of others about the amount of street noise since I have not been bothered in the past by rooms overlooking busy areas. Unless you plan on staying out all night you need an inside room. There is an almost constant stream of cars coming down Fortaleza at night with horns honking, engines revving, stereos blasting and voices shouting until 4am. I am not exaggerating.

<Content>A Great Stay at the Hotel Milano! (March 2005) This cozy little hotel is perfect for travelers looking for a comfortable, clean place to stay, without all the excessive frills. The only frill is the owner, Juan San Emeterio who is as charming, warm, and friendly as his hotel - we hope you will have the pleasure of meeting him. The hotel is smack in the middle of Old San Juan with its cute cobblestone streets and fabulous restaurants, night clubs, and shops within just a few blocks radius. The hotel has its own roof-top restaurant called The Panorama with a pretty view of the harbor and a nice cool breeze. There, you can enjoy tasty traditional Puerto Rican dishes, refreshing pina coladas, and creamy coconut custard (made on site!). We're excited to share with everyone our discovery of this delightful hotel!

<Content>Great place, great view, right price We could not have been more pleased with the accomodations at Hotel Milano. The location is smack dab in the middle of old San Juan and just steps from great restaurants and shops. The roof top restaurant offered good food and a great view. I am surprised that more restaurants have not opened their roofs to the views and breezes. We especially enjoyed watching the cruise ship we had just disembarked, leave later that night. As many have stated, the rooms were not particularly spacious but certainly the cost and location more than made up for that. They were clean and well attended and very safe. We took the larger queen double located in the front of the hotel and it was large enough for the two of us with all our bags and souvenirs. Although there was a television, don't plan to spend much time watching any favorites as the selction is limited. It was nice after a day of sight seeing or shopping to be able to walk to our room and not have to deal with a taxi or car. (Parking is available in garages but is expensive.) I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to San Juan, particularly anyone who is cruising out of the city. It is a nice quiet place to begin or end a trip on a ship.

<Content>Friendly and quaint The hotel is in a very fun area (Old San Juan) and has a VERY friendly staff. The room was clean, but a bit modest. The restaurant (where we ate their nice continental breakfast) offers a nice view of the port and much of the classic old city.Parking is tough, but the town wasn;t built for cars. They will help you find a place.Good value  friendly, helpful service!

<Content>Come for the charm, stay for the view Wherever you stay, be sure to have dinner, or at least a drink, on the rooftop terrace at this hotel. (Walk down Forteleza St. and look for yellow saw horses.) The view is wonderful, the breeze is cooling, and the pina coladas are tasty. This was my first visit to San Juan. I was supposed to stay in Condado, but I'm glad I ended up in Old San Juan. (Condado has the beach, Old San Juan has the forts, shops, and a walkway that runs along the old wall.) The hotel was comfortable, the staff was very friendly, and the owner, Juan San Emeterio was one of the most charming and interesting persons I've met in my travels.

<Content>Perfect hotel in Old San Juan My husband and I found the Hotel Milano (307 Fortaleza Street) perfect for our 3-day stay in Old San Juan. The hotel is walking distance from all the restaurants and sights of beautiful Old San Juan, and has a delightful rooftop ocean-view restaurant where free continental breakfast is served. Rooms are small but clean and well-furnished; the staff is warm and helpful, and all speak English; the atmosphere is quiet. Don't expect luxury, but rather a tranquil and comfortable hominess.

<Content>The bes As Old San Juan is the jewel, the crossroads of the caribbean europe and the americas, hotel milano is the jewel of old san juan. The roof, a fabulous retaurant and intimate bar, is a great place to hide when the cruise ships disgorge there thousands of souvineer hunting touritas.but don't worry they never look up!The ships sail before San Juan dinner and you can emerge from the Milano unscathed and turn left, for some of the finest restaurants and clubs are a few steps to the east Go west for fine shopping and art everwhere. When your exhausted retire to the Milano and sleep well knowing you have saved hundreds a night and few know this secret San Juan Spot

<Content>Top notch location, and a nice hotel overall. This hotel is right in Old San Juan, as central as can be - 5 to 10 minute walk to either old fort, 2 minutes walk to the Parrot Club and sister restaurants. We opted for the cheapest room which at $100/nt although very small, had all the ammenities, like shampoo, towels, tissues, TV/cable, fridge, wake up calls. I state this becasue none of the other hotels we stayed at for similar prices, or more, had all this. The hotel is also pretty new and spotless (www.hotelmilanopr.com). The location was right in the middle of the old city, 5-10 minute walk to both forts, and 3 minutes to the Parrot Club restaurant. The continental breakfast on the roof top with views of the water was just that, a continental breakfast with toast, donuts, coffee/juice, fruit, cereal and self service. This is a little Marriott in the city w/o the price tag or the extra charges. Just be prepared to share some space or pay a bit more $ for a larger room.

<Content>Wish We Could Have Tried It The Milano is currently advertising a special on its web site - stay 4 nights and get the 5th one free. My wife and I will be visiting Puerto Rico next month, and thought that the Milano would be a perfect fit for us.I called the Milano to make our reservations, which seemed to go well until I mentioned the special on the web site. The reservationist on the other end of the line then became very businesslike and slightly cold. He told me that they would not honor that special unless the reservation was made online. The site does not have a function for reserving online, and after I told him this he told me that I had to email the manager.Three emails later, I still have no response. When I called again to explain, I received no sympathy and the news that the room we had requested was no longer available.So much for incentives...

<Content>Let's hope you don't have a complaint!!! I stayed here for the past two nights with my boyfriend. At first we were put into a room at the back of the hotel. We were both awake until 6am with thumping music from a nearby club. When we complained that we couldn't go through another night of sleeplessness all the receptionist told me (actually laughed while he said this) was that the owner was away and he was the person I was to speak with. He would do nothing for us. We asked him three or four times if he could please change our rooms so we could get a better sleep as we expected some disturbance but it was unreal the noise in the back room. Eventually upon our insistance we got our room changed. The price of the hotel is cheap enough and it is in the centre of old San Juan but as long as you get a room at the front and don't have something to complain about....then your experience should be good. As for me.....well we moved to a better hotel with sound proofing!!!!! ha ha

<Content>Wonderful Hotel! Our experience at the Milano was fantastic. My husband and I were on our honeymoon and we were hit by hurricane/tropical storm Jeanne. We were stuck inside while the storm hit. Although there was no power and no where to go for food, the Hotel owner and his staff made sure that food was brought to us and that we were comfortable at all times. We were so impressed with the hospitality that we recieved. The owner also took the time to talk with us and get to know us. The Hotel is also centrally located to great resturants and sight -seeing locations. I would stay here again and so should you!

<Content>Wonderful hotel! February 2004 This small, quaint hotel in the middle of Old San Juan was a delightful surprise. The staff was friendly, the room was clean and nice. The best part was the free breakfast in the roof top restaurant each morning. We sat on the balcony surrounded by plants with a fantastic view. Beyond description! Staying at this hotel was one of the highlights of our trip. We were warned about wandering around Old Puerto Rico at night and, sure enough, there were many sounds of police sirens. Half their rooms are inside without windows (also clean and nice) so be sure to request a room with a window if that's important to you.

<Content>Great Location My daughter found this quaint hotel while touring Old San Juan. It is an ideal location for touring since it is right in the center of the city. We were able to walk everywhere. We had a room in the front since it is the only rooms with large windows. It is well air conditioned and has a refrigerator. The only drawback was no wash cloths (they don't provide them) and no fresh decaf coffee. This was a small price to pay for the friendly staff and comfortable rooms. The restaurant is not available for the handicapped since the elevator does not go to the top floor where it is located. They provided a Continental Breakfast each morning with fresh juice, fruit, cereal, bagels and sweet rolls. The view of the harbor is a plus.If I return to San Juan, I will certainly stay at this hotel.

<Content>DON'T MISS THE MILANO The Milano is a very special hotel, a smallish place nestled in the heart of old San Juan. From some of its rooms there is a glorious view of the port of San Juan, and its rooftop bar and restaurant is an intimate and magical spot at any time of day or evening. But what sets the hotel apart from any other, is its owner and manager, Juan San Emeterio, an extraordinary man, a kind of latter-day Kahlil Gibran. He has written a number of wonderful uplifting spiritual works, and a copy of one of his volumes is left in every room. He will drop everything for a good conversation, and has a natural fascination with people, so that a stay here is a spiritually enlightening experience. The rapturous responses he has received on his website bear witness to the effect a stay at his hotel has had on his clientele. A hotel unlike any other...

<Content>Old San Juan, St. John and Virgin Gorda Summer Vacation We just returned from a destination wedding trip which we also rolled into a two week summer vacation. The wedding was at the WESTIN Hotel on St. John, USVI, and of course was a wonderful affair. As we did not stay at the hotel, I cannot comment on the facilities except Cruz Bay Watersports, who I dived with, were great. There were approximately 80 guest at the wedding and I heard no complaints about the hotel.The trip started from Houston to Old San Juan Puerto Rico, where we stayed in an a modest hotel, The Hotel Milano on Forteleza St. , right in the middle of Old San Juan. It was very close to the restaurants and as Old San Juan is fairly compact, it made sight seeing easy. The staff was gracious and very helpful. The hotel is not fancy, but we had plenty of room and a BB type breakfast before launching out to see the historical sights which are many and actually easy to see in one day. The restaurants Querencia and another restaurant owned by the Parrot Club restaurant owner was wonderfulThe 3rd day we flew to St. Thomas and caught the ferry to St. John for the wedding festivities, days of snorkeling , lying on the beaches and lazing around at a Cloud Nine Villa Moonsong , a wonderful house for two couples. We overlooked Hart Bay which was about a mile and a half from the Westin which made it easy to get to the wedding functions. The beaches on St. John are really magnificent and if there is an odd cruise ship there in the summer and you want to go to Trunk Bay , just go a little early for the perfect spot on the beach. Water Lemon Cay was our favorite snorkeling beach , but others in the party liked Trunk , Frances Bay and Cinnamon Bays. A bay for everyone. Lunches and dinners at Asolare, Paradiso, Fish Trap, Panini's, The Balcony were all wonderful as was the bar and restaurant outside Low Watersports shop. Stay away from the beach bar next toPanini's as the service is non existent but the food was good. The Bar B Q ribs at Uncle Joes fell off the bones .They were so tender. The people at Cloud Nine Villas were wonderful and sent one all the information needed for an island vacation.If you have not used the ferries to get around , do so as they are reasonable means of transportation. WE took the ferry to West End Tortola, cabbed to Roadtown and then took the ferry to Virgin Gorda. We rented a Suzuki jeep from Mahogany Car Rentals and it was really better than the Jeep ented on St. John. We stayed in a perfect house for two, Casa Luna ,rented through Guavaberry Vacation Homes on Virgin Gorda. It was a 3 minute walk to Spring Bay and The Crawl. The Baths and Devil's Bay are just a short walk or snorkle away. The people at Guavaberry could not have been nicer or more helpful. The house they suggested was perfect for us.The bays, beaches and people on Virgin Gorda are wonderful. The BVI islanders are much friendlier and the pace is not as hectic and driven as in the USVI. We had a wonderful time and would recommend the places we stayed and the restaurants we dined at without reservations. The restaurants on Virgin Gorda are limited. We dined at Georgio's Table overlooking Maho Bay and Pond Bay which was expensive but wonderful. We also ate the the Mine Shaft to listen to Morris Mark and see the senset. It is a great sunset place and has all the correct sunset drinks. The Rock wth its piano player and great food was a surprise. For sheer beauty try the Top of the Baths or for a good sandwich, try Mad Dogs in the same general location. A pizza at the Bath and Turtle was also great.We flew to St. Thomas to return home but to make the plane we overnighted at a local small 12 room hotel, Villa Blanca and had our last dinner at Randy's. The dinner was truly wonderful. The restaurant is also a bistro and wine shop in the hills above Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas.A great vacationand I would recommend such a trip to anyone who enjoys the swaying palms trees. beautiful water, snorkling and diving, not to mention great meals.Russell Ramsey

<Content>A Solid 3 star hotel This is a 3 star hotel, nothing more, nothing less--typical if you have traveled in Europe in similar accomodations. Rooms clean, clean towels, decent front desk help. The night attendant was not very helpful, day staff much better. Limited Breakfast--free--but not that great. Coffee was good. Perfect for us because we had a full sightseeing plan and needed a place to shower, clean up and rest. Location is really fantastic, you can walk everywhere from the hotel--shopping and restaurants right at your fingertips. We parked for free near the municipal lot, not inside, although it is very reasonable at $5.00 a day. Car rental is a must if in PR for more than a day. We enjoyed having flexibility in being able to get around (plus we saw more than on foot) and our trip to the rain forest (El Yunque) was excellent--don't miss it, extend your trip if necessary. Tio's Bar and Rest right next to the hotel is a great stop to have a drink--we went every night--great mojitos. Breni, blonde bartender gave us great tips, even helped us find a laundromat--tell her hi from the NY couple looking for a laundromat! El Bombonera, a PRican diner was good fun. Gruff service, but decent and cheap food--lots of locals eat there. El Convento for tapas and sangria was a great dinner alternative. Walking and discovering is the best way to enjoy Old San Juan, having a hotel in the heart of it all is worth it and gives you the flexibility to see as much as possible. Casino a short walk away. If taking a cruise (RC or Princess), avoid going to the pier before 4 or 5pm. The traffic is insane and there is only 1 road that gets you to the Pan American pier. Enjoy Old San Juan!

<Content>Great Service/ Great Location Hotel Milano has the best location in San Juan. Great front desk service, ok cleaning service, but attended fast if requested. It is next to great shops and restaurants. It is very safe day and night. You would not need car if you just want to hangout in Old San Juan. Hotel Milano is the place to stay. Make sure you get front rooms. The price difference from front to rear rooms is small. From front rooms you get a nice view of the bay and Fortaleza Street and the rear rooms have no open windows. Have a great time. We loved Old San Juan.

<Content>Good times in Old San Juan A buddy and I went to San Juan in 4/04 and stayed at the Hotel Milano. We could not have asked for a better place to stay. It was centrally located to all of Old San Juans attractions and it is on the same block as the city's best restaurants. You could always stay on the beach in Condado or Isla Verde, but you miss out on the character and charm of Old San Juan. Besides, the beach was only a 25 cent bus ride (takes 30 minutes). A cab would run you anywhere from 10-16 dollars to go to the beach. Right around the block from Hotel Milano was Senor Frogs, a really fun party spot any night of the week. We met some beautiful women there and danced and drank all night. Hotel Milano was also close to the pier to catch the boat to Catano to see the Bacardi factory, which is a must see. The hotel is also not far from Calle San Sebastian which throws an amazing block party/street fair the first Tuesday of every month. The hotel is very nice and the staff was very helpful. If you are interested in seeing daylight, make sure you ask for a front room because the back rooms do not have windows. Also the continental breakfast was disappointing. Toast and going bad fruit just did not cut it. Besides that, I would definately stay here again for the convenience and location

<Content>We were surprised! This hotel is not for the faint of heart. Understand that you get what you pay for. With that said, we had a wonderful experience. The hotel was clean, the staff extremely friendly and helpful and the location could not have been better. The price was one of the most reasonable in San Juan and we took a gamble. It turned out to be worth it. There's nothing better than walking out the front door of your hotel and being in the midst of the streets of Old San Juan. The nightclub on Saturday night was quite loud. Wake up early and walk the few blocks up the hill to El Morro, then walk back to the hotel and watch the streets come alive. We will definitely return to Old San Juan and will plan to stay at Hotel Milano.

<Content>Very clean above average 3 star hotel with good sevice It is a really good hotel. They change towels every day, make the bed and clean the room sooo good. The hotel itself really neat. Every day they put a bottle of water in the cooler and put candies on the drawer :-) You should defenately try some seafood at the Panarama restaurant located on the roof. Guys at the reception are very friendly but not very helpful with giving information about the town, you better go to information center which is 3 blocks down. Choice of food for breakfast is limited to toasts coffee and fruits. The location is great, all bars and restaurants are just 2-3 blocks away. People that live in fancy restaurants on the beach come to Old San Juan at nights, because it's absolutely nothing to do around there.

<Content>Can't wait to return! After a number of stays in the beachfront Condado and Isla Verde areas, My husband and I decided to spend a week in Old San Juan. We were lucky to find a lovely hotel that was within easy walking distance of all the wonderful historical and cultrural sites. The Hotel Milano reflected the rich vibrant atmosphere of the old city. It was clean ,decorated in soft colors, and furnished with some lovely antiques. The bed was very comfortable after a long day of sight-seeing. There was plenty of storage, a nice bathroom and a good-sized refrigerator. A small market several blocks away kept us supplied with snacks and beverages. The staff was warm and inviting and went out of their way to accomodate my wheelchair needs. Although we know a little Spanish, it was reassuring to know that almost all staff were also fluent in English and made several phone calls for us in Spanish. The rooftop restaurant served delicious food. The complimentary breakfast was a pleasant surprise. We appreciated the personalized service that is missing in the large chain hotels. We look forward to returning soon to a place that really felt like home.

<Content>Be afraid!! What a joke... keep away.. Rude front desk help, booked Harbor View Room, had view of a building across street.. Was told only the roof top bar has a view of the Harbor... Internet Connection... sure if you bring your own computer, and pay something stupid like $1.00 per min to connect. Elevator could stand to be updated, since it dates from the 40's. And gotta love the interior hallways and stairs are not air conditioned. Was there in July, perhaps over 100 inside. There web site says 4 stars by Foder's ... Foder's does not even mention them.. Pay the extra money and stay at the El Convento or in Condado and take a taxi into Viejo San Juan!!

<Content>Wonderful Stay We had a wonderful stay at Hotel Milano. We were there 3 nights (post Cruise) and found that ending our vacation in Old San Juan just topped our vacation (Jan 2004). The front desk staff - met at least 3 of them- all were very friendly  assisted us with phone calls ie) to scuba shops, taxis.. from the front desk/lobby phones. As with other comments on your site, the Location was the best. Shopping and Eating at all hours!! That's a delight. We certainly would not have had the experience - walking down the cobblestone streets  meeting shopkeepers, etc.. if we stayed at Hotel Strip ie) where all the big chains of hotels build up. We were adventurous  was able to walk to Fort Morro  Fort Cristobal. Walking a block to take the ferry over to the Barcardi Distillary was also great fun! Free drinks there!!

<Content>Great location Just spent 5 nights at the Milano. The rooms are small but very clean and the bed was very comfortable. I was upgraded to a room with windows which you have to stand on a chair to look out of and which overlooked the air conditioning units. However, I still found the windows helpful as they only had a few lights with 25 watt bulbs which I found it very difficult to read by. (I finally went out and purchased a 60 watt to work by. )I found the staff to be somewhat indifferent, the food in the top floor restaurant to be very good and the location of the hotel excellent. On Friday and Saturday nights the music from a nearby nightclub actually vibrated the walls and my bed from 10:30 pm to about 3:30 am. At least the music was good.
