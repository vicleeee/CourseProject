<Content>State of the Art Arrived late at the hotel which was being renovated and when show to the room was blown away by the standard and the quality of the finish.The whole atmosphere is very modern and very state of the art but is exceedingly comfortable and excellent value for food and beveridge. it is in an ideal location and would certainly recommend it.

<Content>The Mira (mar) was marvellous!! Great, great hotel.Now called The Mira Hong Kong be sure to ask for a renovated room.Ours was on the eighth floor and although there was no view to speak about the facilities inside the room were just amazing.Great flat-screen TV/Computer monitor with free Internet access. The most comfortable hotel bed we've ever slept in and a bathroom to die for. Separate shower - dual system with a conventional shower-head and a ceiling panel that just threw water at you like you were standing in a rainstorm - although totally controllable!Can't fault the Staff - they were welcoming, almost too-helpful (I can press the button to call the lift myself - but wasn't allowed to!!) and were able to check us in on-line with BA no problem.The bar prices are quite steep as are those for the mini-bar, but a two-minute walk away is a 7-11 shop selling Australian wine for about 拢5.00 a bottle a bottled beer for 50p a pint.When we go back to Hong Kong the Mira will be our first choice.(They are renovating the rooms at present [autumn 2008] so be sure to ask for a renovated room when you book.)

<Content>Excellent, non chain stay This is a great stay for anyone who wants top class service and amenities in Hong Kong without booking into a chain. The rooms are a little dated compared to some of its competitors, but the Miramar is having an overhaul. The location couldn't be better with TST on your doorstep and Central two stops away by metro. Be sure you get a non smoking floor.

<Content>Great staff and great location I found the staff here to be extremely helpful without exception. I was with a group and everyone else had positive experiences as well. My room was unrennovated, so its furnishings were a little dated. But it was quite clean, nonetheless.The hotel's location is very convenient to Kowloon Park (a nice little respite from the urbanity) and the Metro station. Less than a block up Nathan, toward Austin Rd is a nice coffee place where you can get western-style breakfast food and internet access. Also, being connected to the Miramar Shopping Mall means being connected to some restaurants in that mall (only a few days into the visit, I began to crave spicy food- the mall has a good szechuan place, a korean place, etc). We easily walked to the Jade Market, the waterfront, etc. I'd stay there again.

<Content>Spacious, nicely lighted rooms This is my 2nd time staying in this hotel. The last time I stayed, I remembered the rooms to be rather dim, so it was a pleasant surprise to find the rooms nicely lighted. The hotel is under going some renovations, so the hotel lobby has been shifted up to the 2nd level. There is plenty of staffs at the front office. However, the staff who attended to us was rather cool in her reception. Rooms are spacious for Hong Kong standard. We stayed in the normal rooms, so there was no free internet access. It was advised that their business rooms  club floor rooms come with internet access. The bed is large, but a little soft for my liking. Toilet is equipped with the basic amenities, but I was rather shocked to find they do not provide combs or shaver set. There is a gym with pool which can only be accessed with the guest card.Overall a pleasant experience. With the exception of the one cool staff, the rest of them were all very friendly.

<Content>Great Location We stayed here in August 06 as part of a family holiday ( 2 kids) for 5 nights. The location is great very central close to MTR stop and a 10 minute walk from the Star Ferry terminal with a bus stop outside as an alternative. There are plenty of shops and restaurants right outside. The hotel is busy and check in took some time. We were upgraded to a suite which turned out to be an ashtray - it stank of smoke disgusting. We were then given a 'normal' room overlooking the park which was no smoking clean and perfectly adequate. Breakfast in the atrium was poor and expensive - we were given one free breakfast and would not eat there again. Better options nearby. There was a small pool in the basement which was good for the kids to let off steam. Great location and despite the bustle the room was quiet.

<Content>Perfect Location We stayed at Hotel Miramar in Kowloon for 3 nights. The hotel was having the lobby refurbished which made it a bit hard to find the entrance, but once we did we were greeted by friendly helpful staff. The staff were always courteous and helpful throughout our stay.We booked the executive club which allowed us many privileges. (Executive club foodspread is always basic in HK compared to other countries).Our room was had 1980's decor, but it was perfectly clean and spacious. The hotel was located centrally. The central shopping mall and the star ferry pier were within walking distance, as was the MTR which is essential in HK. It was easy for us to come back and drop shopping off and venture out again because of it's location. There were nearby night markets and Ashley Road closeby has some great bars and restaurants. Nearby Chung Kung Mall offers the best exchange rates.We stayed at the Exelsior a couple of years ago - Miramar is definately better.I am sure this hotel will have an amazing lobby next year, especially if the temporary one is anything to go by!This is an ideal city hotel and I do not have any reservations recommending it.

<Content>Not fancy but clean and well located We stayed at this hotel as a second choice as our first choice was under renovation and low and behold this hotel also is under renovation which was not pleasant - on arrival our booking was stuffed up and took a bit of fixing but the staff were very helpful. We had nice room but maybe old rooms as they seemed dated but we were together which was what we wanted. The staff were really nice and very helpful and nothing was too much trouble from the concierge to the cleaning crew. Despite the renovations we had a pleasant stay and it was very central to all the things we wanted and a 2 minute walk from the train station which was handy.Our stay was ruined when we went to check out and I was slugged with an $45AU phone bill for using my calling card to call my kids from the room any where else this is the cost of a local call - they were very unhelpful and could not show me where it states that cost in the hotel rules and would not reduce the bill at all. I was furious by the time we left and I can say that ruined a nice stay at the hotel. It is not fancy but clean and well located if that is what you are looking for.

<Content>Good Location Satisfactory Hotel Situated relatively close to the Star Ferry this hotel meets all your basic requirements with reasonable luxury. It is a big hotel in a very busy city and this will impact on your opinion. We found it fine, with good breakfasts clean rooms and helpful staff. We would use it again and as experienced travellers this is not always the case.

<Content>WM from Australia - Central position Hotel Miramar, 118-130 Nathan Road, Kowloon. We stayed in a Club Floor Room which is on the 9th floor only. Inclusions were buffet breakfast, complimentary beverage after breakfast until 8-30pm, complimentary cocktail reception 6-8-30pm, unlimited b/band internet,complimentary laundry, unlimited minibar, complimentary drink vouchers and 20% discount in hotels outlets. Room was as large as some of Melbourne's better hotels. Service, cleanliness and friendliness of all staff was excellent. Position was great as Tour East pickup was in next street (Kimberley). Walking distance to all attractions. I would recommend this hotel for its executive room and inclusions and would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Bustling Outside - quiet inside A modern hotel set in the bustling Kowloon District. The staff are very friendly and the rooms are above average in size. We did not eat in the hotel as it was quite expensive and there are so many fantastic restaurants close. The rooms are well sound proofed as you do not hear a thing from outside. Just accross the road is Kowloon park and from our window we could watch the locals excerising. The hotel is basically inside a shopping mall where you will find everything.The underground is 2 mins away.

<Content>Miramar Hotel We recently visited Hong Kong and stayed at the Miramar. All I can say is stay somewhere else. It was terrible. The rooms smelt of that musty/mouldy smell. They are in the throws of renovating so it may be better once the reno's are completed - it would want to be. I complained ferociously and told them that it was more a 2 star hotel than a 4 star and demanded to be shifted which I was after sitting in the foyer for 5 hours demanding to see management. They were going to upgrade me to a new room if I paid!!! In the end I got a newly refurbished room at a normal rate. Not worth the hassle as it was our first stop on our 6 week trip away.

<Content>Mirramar Hotel- Excellent Place To Stay Spent four nights at Mirramar Hotel and found it to be a excellent Hotel. The accommodation was very nice and the staff from front desk to room attendants were very friendly and helpful. We included breakfast with our booking and this was excellent valueas the buffet had a lot to choose from and once again the restaraunt staff were faultless. The location of the hotel is good being about 10 minute walk to star ferry wharf, and right in amongst thge shopping area. Tour I would recommend is the Peak Tram Tour, however the shopping tour to Shenzhen was a bit worrying as we were left alone for 4 hours at a shopping mall after being told by tour guide to be careful of pick pockets and other local hoodlums who would think nothing about robbing you. Anyway that was the only negative aspect as HONG KONG was great felt very safe and would highly recommend it and the Mirramar Hotel to any potential travellers. Hope to visit again soon.Dave Clouston Sydney Australia

<Content>Good hotel but avoid rooms at the back Excellent location - room very comfortable and room service efficient. Although in the center of Kowloon on Nathan Road, you are not bothered by the city noices. but... helas there is currently an issue : if you get a room in the back, the window overlooks some construction work. Our window was completely obstructed by deposits and we could not even see through to find out if there was sun or rain!! For the price paid, we could at leat expect some regular window cleaning. The feeling was even as if the room had no windows. Inacceptable in a hotel of that level. And we did not receive a discount for that that inconvenience.

<Content>Pros and Cons-mostly cons Pros: Nice breakfast, okay location (on Nathan Rd), rooms are okay. Con: Customer Service was frightful- god help you if you have a problem on the weekend. The customer service manager (Cheng) took no responsibilty to fix a dreadful problem caused by the hotel. Obviously I have an axe to grind here, but suffice to say I was not pleased with the uncaring and unhelpful results of the manager. Also, 1 outlet in the whole room, get into the 1980's folks! Oh, thanks for the broken iron, and for the A/C shutting off. I think your GM needs to stop worrying about Chamber of Commerce issues, and get to work on the little things wrong with her hotel.Next, year we are heading back to either the Holiday Inn or YMCA. you wowed our travel agent but ticked off the end-user.

<Content>It worth the money Stayed in superior room on 24-29 Mar07. Hotel is well maintain, clean and neat. Not as sparkling as the 5star business hotel, but more than enough for leisure trip. Staffs are very helpful, service is quick. Room is at good size considering it is hongkong. The twin beds are comfortable and it is a 1.2m wide twin bed. MTR is one minute walking distance. Not much view from my room which I guess will be the case for most superior room. In the middle of shopping area, restaurants are all over the place. Will certainly comeback.

<Content>Good Value! I stayed at this hotel in early January 2007. The location is very good and rooms are ok for a 4 star, nothing really special but worth it for the price. We were very lucky we were upgraded to a suite. Personnel at the front desk are really helpful and very friendly.

<Content>Central to City Very clean, nice entrance and staff at the door to welcome you in. Double bed very small (lengthwise) but standard room spacious and had all that was needed. Situated on Nathan Road, ideal for shopping but slightly too far out when walking to the Star Ferry for Hong Kong Island. Ideal for Kowloon Park which is worth a visit to chill after the tremendous pace of the city. Be sure to visit Stanley Road Market - you need to catch a bus (No 9 from HK Island) but it is well worth it and the scenery on the way down is great.

<Content>Great Base We Stayed at the Miramar on a stop over to Mauritius and I had to drag my husband to Hong Kong screaming and kicking all the way I then had to drag him away, we loved it. This hotel was a fabulous base to see Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, we couldn't have chosen better for the price. The Lobby is beautiful and the restuarant clean. The breakfast would keeps us going for the day. Full English , continental through to my favourite dim-sum what a start. The rooms were very clean with coffee/tea facilities. There is also a mini bar but as with all alchohol in Hong Kong its expensive. The staff were helpful and friendly. The main shopping streets are located all around this hotel and the Star ferry a ten minute walk down the road, the bus stops and underground are just outside also. The back street restuarants that surround this hotel are too many to count, we found some amazing places and never spent more than 拢20gb per evening meal. While there we experienced the best ever excursion to Sha Tin the race track, we where picked up locally and escorted to the track, a private box with all tickets, food, drink and guide included, it was absolutly fantastic and well recommended. We also jumped onto some of the many ferries that took you to tiny islands, some with no traffic, what a pleasure. I cannot really say enough about this holiday how exciting, invigorating and amazing it truly was. Go for it.

<Content>Excellent hotel I stayed here for three nights this October on route to Australia and couldn't have been better pleased. Good location, clean rooms, attentive staff. The groundfloor restaurant was used for breakfast and was excellent. Buffet style, well laid out and again, attentive staff. Very handy for most locations and within walking distance of Star Ferries, Temple Street night market (a must see!!) etc. Room size was good, clean and with a minibar. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. We will stay their next time!

<Content>Great location We stayed at the Miramar for 4 nights and found it to be a good hotel for the price we paid (approx HKD685 per night excluding the 13% taxes). The hotel is well located on Nathan Rd with Tsim Sha Tsui MTR just a couple of minutes away. Plenty of shopping and food places just outside the hotel.Our room was a twin with two double beds. It also had two arm chairs and a round coffee table where we could enjoy a cup of tea after a long day sightseeing and shopping. Tea/coffee making facilities provided. The room also had a business desk and safe. The room including the bathroom was clean and the shower was great (good pressure). After having read reviews on various hotels and room sizes being small in Hong Kong, we were pleased with the size of the room and happy that it did not turn out to be a shoe box. Our flight was at night and the hotel allowed us to use their fitness facilities to shower and get refreshed before heading to the airport. No charge for this.Being our first trip to Hong Kong, this hotel was a great base for our tours around Kowloon, Hong Kong Island and Lantau Island.

<Content>Good Location My mom and I stayed in this hotel for 4 days and 3 nights. The hotel is located near a MTR station (Tsim Sha Tsui) which becomes more convenient upon traveling to different places around Hong Kong. Mc Donald's, Pizza Hut and KFC are also near the hotel, as well as the Welcome Supermarket and 711 Stores which I can easily buy snacks and drinks. I also love that this hotel has a mall; shopping areas are very near to this place like Granville Road wherein different shops are located. From the hotel it is also easy to access when you want to experience Symphony of the lights at Avenue of the Stars or ride a Star Ferry. For me it was a perfect location. The room size in this hotel is quite huge for twin sharing. I must say that the room is very clean and the staff that often checks the room is very friendly and accommodating.

<Content>Central Location  Just returned from a 13 night stay in the Miramar Hotel. The location is great. It is opposite the Miramar Shopping Mall which can be accessed directly from the hotel so you can go shopping with out having to go outside when its raining. This also connects to Knutsford Steps which has a good Starbucks. The MTR Station is only a 2 minutes walk away which gives access to almost anywhere in Hong Kong.This is the second time we've stayed in this hotel and found it to be very good value for money and a very nice hotel. Staff were friendly and attentive and whenever we requested anything from housekeeping etc it was there in a flash!We did get a complimentary upgrade from our travel company and the room we had on the 12th floor was a nice size, clean and more than adequate as there is so much to see in Hong Kong that you probably won't spend much time in the room. There was a turndown service every night when everything was topped up and tidied up, and the beds were very comfortable.If you want a drink in the bar go between 5pm  9pm when its Happy Hours. All you can drink for 98 HK Dollars and entertainment too. For an extra 60 HK Dollars you can drink until 11pm. Great Value!!The gym is quite good and newly refurbished. The pool would have been very nice if it hadn't been so cold. The attendant assured me the water was 30 degrees, but with the aircon on full blast it felt very cold. There is a sauna in each changing room.All in all a good hotel in a very good location. We would definitely use again.

<Content>Poor reception The front desks staffs gave us a bad first impression. Not one of them smile to the guests. In fact they only smile when they engaged in their small talks.Book a room prior to my trip, when we reached the hotel at 2.45 pm, but we were made to wait an hour at the lobby for the room to be cleaned up. None of the requests (i.e. double bedroom, higher floor) that we put across when we book the room were fulfilled. My wife and me have to make do with seperate beds and dummy window with the view of a back alley.I have stayed at a nearby 3 stars Hotel before, their front desk gave me better impression. If do not mind some poor front desk services, the hotel is situated at great location.

<Content>Excellent hotel The Miramar is a busy hotel based in the middle of Kowloon,opposite a good shopping center and very close to restaurantsand shops in busy Kowloon. I always stay there and can recommend their newly refurbished execuitve rooms.The staff at the hotel are very good and the food served is well above average. Great hotel at a reasonable price, will continue to stay there when in Hong Kong.

<Content>Good hotel and service. After staying here for five nights in march i can say i found the hotel very good.The hotel staff were excellent.Anything we wanted no matter at what time day or night we got in minutes.The two trips we went on to the big budda and disneyland were booked at the hotel and we were picked up from the lobby,good value and service.Breakfast was excellent having great choice and service.Room was big and clean but did need modernizing.Hotel is in great location and as we paid about 80 pounds a night good value for money.I would recommend travellers on this sort of budget to stay here.

<Content>Struck it lucky Other reviewers seem to have a love/hate experience; we got just what we were hoping for.We were overnighting on our way across the world and just needed enough room and quiet for my wife, 2-year- and 6-month-old and myself to catch up on sleep and have a base from which to explore a little. We only booked about two days ahead through an online agency, and the requested extra bed for our toddler had not been confirmed. It wasn't there when we got into our room but, seeing how big the beds were (they were what I would call a 3/4 bed - certainly big enough for two people), we didn't care. If I were staying for longer and weren't planning on sleeping most of the time I would make sure to get a room not facing the interior courtyard, which is basically three huge boilers and some roofing - very stagnant chi. I suspect the room used to be smoking-allowed, because it couldn't quite shake a dank musty smell - or is that Hong Kong in general?The staff were helpful, and not being hotel users normally we were thrilled at having people handle our luggage and hail taxis for us, although tipping is a mystery to New Zealanders (for the record: the front desk lady recommended HK$20 for porters, which seemed to do the trick).We didn't make use of the hotel facilities apart from their broadband, but I must say being across the road from Kowloon Park is great, and it's in the middle of a whole heap of shops. There are good and varied eateries in the Miramar Mall across the street. So I would certainly stay here again. A note on airport transfers: I generally like to use public transport, but we took a taxi each way at non-peak times, which cost just shy of $300 each time - better than saving a few dollars if you are struggling with kids and luggage.

<Content>Rich Location~Poor Value! Three of us required a night's stay in Hong Kong and unfortunately didn't book a hotel room in advance. We preferred to stay in the harbour area of Kowloon and decided to walk around and pick out a hotel. Bad idea. Most hotels were booked up and we ended up at the Mirimar Hotel. Happy about the location and the fact that a room was available, we decided to stay for about $300.00 USD (for the 3 of us) in one crowded and dreary room. There was no view at all because the window wouldn't open and the glass was covered with frosted transluscent plastic. It was a non-smoking room, but still stank of stale smoke and one wall had mold stains on the wallpaper. Also, the extra bed was jammed up against the controls for the light switches and we had a really hard time turning the lights on and off. The service was lukewarm and an overall mediocre experience. I stayed in way better hotels in Hong Kong for much less money. It pays to shop around in advance!

<Content>Stayed 3 times - will stay a 4th I've stayed at the Miramar 3 times, as well as the Holiday Inn Golden Mile and the BP International over the last 3 years.The Miramar for both it's price and location are hard to beat. It's right between Tsim Sha Tsui and Jordan, so you get the best of both worlds in being able to easily walk to either shopping district.The rooms are always nice and clean, the staff helpful, and the buffet beakfast is also very good.If you like the Holiday Inn, go for the Miramar - it' pretty much the same for less money. The only downside to this hotel, is that you have to have to snake your way through the third level corridors to get to th pool and gym (or go outside the hotel and take a lift).I really like this hotel (rooms are much bigger than at BP International), and will be staying there again next week. Roccomended.

<Content>Miramar has excellent location Miramar is in a great location. I stayed for 6 nites in September 2005. I would definitely stay here again. I booked my standard room thru Expedia at a good price  was able to use the swimming pool (big  empty, I had the whole pool to myself) at no extra charge. The bathroom grout was dirty, I didnt have liquid soap for bathing on the first day, the key to my in-room safe didnt work  the manager never fixed it, there was only 1 public phone in the lobby  the staff was not knowledgable about the free Airport Express shuttle bus, which stops right outside---BUT---I recommend Miramar cuz of the excellent location  spacious room  nice toiletries.

<Content>Nice room, good location! We just got back from a 4 days stay in Hongkong. We stayed at Miramar Hotel. The location is accessible to all modes of transportation be it ferry, bus or MTR. The rooms are clean and has a complimentary bottled water everyday. The hotel staff well trained and attentive to our needs. From the airport we took Airport Express to Kowloon station there's a free shuttle which stops right at the doorstep of Hotel Miramar which is located in Nathan Road TST. Nearby is the famous Granville St where you can find great bargains for ladies clothes and accessories. 15-20 mins walk you can reach Harbour City- Ocean Terminal a huge shopping complex famous for branded items. 7-11, Mcdonalds, KFC, some dimsum restaurant are just few blocks away. We will surely come back and stay in this hotel.

<Content>Great location but rooms need updating I have stayed in many hotels in Hong Kong I would say that if you are going to stay in Kowloon this has the best location. It is right by the MTR, buses, shops, good restaurants etc and is in a bustling part of town. I would recommend the chinese restaurant in the hotel at which we ate a delicious and very reasonable lunch on two occasions. The cafe/buffet on the ground floor was also good. I used the pool and gym which were satisfactory and as a guest was surprised to be charged a small fee for this.The rooms are bigger than most in HK and ours was clean, though quite tired looking and in need of a facelift. I learned after my stay that the hotel is in two parts, the old (which we were in) and newly built part, and that the rooms are nicer in the new one but smaller. We did have problems with the air con system leaking which affected several rooms on our floor but was promptly seen to and cleaned up. The main problem we had was noise. We stayed on the 5th floor and every night could hear the hotels bar/disco playing thumping music till at least 1am (sunday i think) and 2-3 am every other night. I would stay here again for the location and convenience only if I got another good deal on the rates. I would also stay in the new part and ask to be higher up to avoid any noise.

<Content>Great Location, OK Service, Run Down Rooms Stayed for 6 days in Jun 2005 for the third time. Don't let the lobby fool you. The rooms are not as impressive as the lobby.When we checked in, they informed us that the only rooms available were non-smoking rooms without a window or smoking rooms. When we told them both were unacceptable, they told us that our travel agency did not request either. So, they could put us in whichever room available. After more arguing, they told us we would have to wait 40 minutes for a nonsmoking room with a window. Until then, I had not realized a window had to be requested! The concierge desk was very accomodating and friendly.The furniture was run down and the bathroom tile was a bit scary: the grout was moldy and disgusting. The carpet was run down, but somewhat clean. The towels were okay, but reminds me of towels from a two star hotel. The rooms were spacious. The room we stayed in had advertisements indicating that the room had broadband access. When we inquired about broadband access, the front desk informed us that it was not available for the standard room. Why advertise it if it isn't available?The hotel is in a very good location. We weren't too far in Tsimshatsui where we would have to take a subway/taxi to get to other parts of Kowloon. This is not what I expected for a 4 star hotel. I expected a more accomomadting front desk and a less run down room. I will most likely not stay at the Miramar again.
