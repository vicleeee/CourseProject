<Content>Fabulous Hotel My husband and I ,and another couple ,stayed at the Royal Park Hotel for 5 nights during a 2+ week vacation in Japan . The hotel was fantastic. We booked rooms on their executive level. Service was the very best we've ever had, the rooms were well decorated, each room had a PC for client use,we had use of their wonderful spa with gym, pool, sauna and the works...and they were wonderful; the complementary buffet breakfast was exquisite. The location of the hotel couldn't be any better...in a mostly residential neighboorhood, away from all the huge Tokyo crowds, but very convenient with a subway line right by the hotel. Travel to/from Narita Airport is also simplified by having the Limousine Bus station right next door to the hotel..it beats having to drag luggage up and down stairs and dealing with the crowds at Tokyo Station for the Narita train! We highly recommend this hotel....it's one of the best managed properties we've stayed in.

<Content>Grreat Hotel in a Lovely City Although we are world travelers we have never been to Tokyo. I found a great package deal on Skyauction.com. It included round trip air from LAX to Narita on Northwest airlines and 7 nights at the Royal Park Hotel that ended up costing us $1644 each. It was advertised as a 4 star hotel but I think it should be 5 stars. Everyone at the hotel was very attentive and friendly, especially the girls at the bell captains desk who helped us make reservations for a trip to Kyoto on the bullet train and get tickets to a Chuck Mangeoini Jazz Concert at the Cotton Club. We had a standard room (not on the executive floor) and it was very nice. 16th floor room with large window that overlooked a large section of the city. Wonderful toiletries in the bathroom. We thought the restaurant prices were high (breakfast was $23, dinner about $100 each) so we ate at neighborhood places, which was much cheaper. The location is wonderful, as the Friendly Airport Limousine Bus terminal is just next door. We took the bus directly from Narita to the station for about $28 each. The porter from the hotel came with a cart to get our luggage. (Use the Royal Park direct line from the bus lobby). The subway is directly under the hotel and we went all over Tokyo on the subway. The hotel sells 1 day passes cheaper than at the station. (about $6). For some cheap eats, McDonalds is in the bus terminal on the 2nd floor. The terminal is immaculate and so are the subways. Very easy to get around and explore Tokyo cheaply. For a great evening, take in a concert at the Cotton Club (near Tokyo station) or go walking in the Ginza area. Take the subway to Ginza. We also booked a 1 day tour on the bullet train to Kyoto (from Tokyo City tours) that included lunch for about $225 each. Great price as we found out that the train tickets (if you buy them yourselves) are more than $275 each. The tour price inluded a lovely lunch at the hotel adjoining the Kyoto train station. (another great place with a 5 star hotel and a beautiful shopping mall). Overall, I thought the hotel was first rate and highly recommend it.Pat and Tom ElliottOrange, California

<Content>Perfect service, perfect stay. Booked on my banks AMEX travel service. Didn't know much about the hotel but it looked good and had a good price.I ended up staying here for 8 nights.6 with my g/f. 2 with a friend.Both rooms were on the Executive floor.From the very start service was outstanding. So so friendly. At check-in there was a problem with my room, due to me wanting a King bed and them booking a twin. Problem was rectified after they personally showed me some rooms to make sure I was happy with them. Made check-in a little bit longer but they were very helpful and it was kinda fun.Rooms are nice. Nothing ultra modern, nothing dated. Nice and comfortable. The great thing about this hotel is that you get a PC with free internet! In our room we had a tv facing the bed and a PC on a separate desk.Breakfast was great, we were in a smaller area due to being on the executive level - no queues for the omelette guy which was great!The only other restaurant at the hotel we tried was the sushi bar - it was average.There is a train station directly underneath the hotel and another one 5 minutes walk away.The area the hotel is in is a bit further from the 'action' of Tokyo. However, it has great restaurants and feels a lot more relaxed and homely. You get the feeling you could be staying at a apartment because its not all glitzy and touristy.The nighttime cabs back from Shibuya will hurt your wallet though!Overall - Perfect comfortable stay. Nothing bad. Great service, always smiling, always willing to help and genuinely friendly.

<Content>Decent hotel, decent price...... Stayed for 5 nights in a delux room. We knew the hotel was a little out of the way, but felt the access to the bus to to/from the airport and the fact that it was above the metro system was an advantage. Also like to get out and about in places that are not always in the centre of things. Hotel handy for shop accross the road for drinks snacks etc.We arrived very early (9.30am) and a room was not ready which we expected as the hotel was full from the night before, but the staff did all they could to find a room at the rate we had paid but none were clean,so we were offered a upgrade at a reducd rate to the club foor. We normally stay on the club foors but find ourselves increasingly cutting our day short to return for cocktails, and getting up for b/fast when really just want a little lie in, so on this occasion we just booked a normal room at a good price for Tokyo. We waited with a coffee for just under an hour for a room to be ready.Room quite a good size, a little worn in places and quite drab in decoration. But everything you needed including a safe (which is in the bedside cabinet). Comfy bed, ok linen but the bathroom was a little dated but clean, shower over bath which was very low to stand under, although the toilet was an laugh as everyone knows who has been to Tokyo. All the bits and bobs you need in the bathroom as far as shampoo etc. were there. Only real gripe was the amount and size of towels, but you could ring up for more.Room faced the expressway which was well soundproofed from the traffic, although could hear bathrooms a little from other rooms. Eventhough we were next to the lifts we never heard them.Access to a tv come pc in the room with internet access was good, but you do pay if you use the internt on your on pc, which was fair enough.Shops below the hotel handy as well. Did not have b/fast or use the bars but there was quite a selection of eating places in the hotel to choose from if needed.All in all we wanted a decent hotel at a fair price with easy acces to get around, which is what the Royal Park provided, if I was to go to Tokyo again, if the price was good we would stay again

<Content>Disappointed I agree with previous review. I stayed both at Park Hotel for 3 days, and then my last night at Royal Park Hotel. I paid much higher at Royal Park Hotel and it wasn't worth it.Room was old, hallway was dark, no safe in room....I was amazed by Tokyo Park Hotel, and I would not go back to Royal Park.

<Content>It Was Fine, But A Little Out of the Way I had seen the reviews on this site, and figured, if I'd stayed at the #1 hotel (Tokyo Park Hotel) and loved it, why not stay at the #2?I have to say that between the two, I liked the Tokyo Park Hotel more. That hotel's rooms were modern and thoughtfully designed. The Royal Park's rooms were clean and also well thought out, but I had thought, nothing that special. More than adequate, but less than awesome.Chuo-ku is a vast district, which includes Ginza. The hotel however, is right on the fringe of the district. It is, as many other guests have mentioned, very close to the Tokyo City Air Terminal, which does help to minimize the pain of coming in from Narita. However, you're not exactly in a happening area either by staying here.I will say this - my wife is expecting in a few months, and I was delighted to find that there is a nearby temple that is dedicated to easy childbirths. I walked over there and threw in a few coins as an offering. I had evidently gone on a big day (maybe it's always that busy)!Service was good. I had taken the advice of others, as I didn't have any free meals, and ate elsewhere. As mentioned, there's a good ramen place just beyond the temple on the main road. But I think if you want to stay in a nifty district of Tokyo, one can probably be closer. On the other hand, you are right on top of a subway station so the connections are good during the day.

<Content>Great Service We went on to book this hotel based on the tripadvisor ranking and feedbacks. Its a great hotel with great service. I cannot say enough about the service. We were checked in into smoking rooms but we were not told about it. After complaining, the desk staff reception who checked us in came up to the floor and apologize profusely. He also gave us a new room and transferred our bags.The breakfast buffet is ok. You get eggs, bacon, sausages, salmon, omelet, rice pilaf. The location is just ok, there is not much activity in the area but the hotel is connected to the subway station so you can easily go to any place you want. Ginza is 2 transfers away, so no problem there.The view we got from our room was not so good. If you look out the window, we see cars and an elevated expressway. We were usually out and at night we close the curtains.Its a good value for money hotel.

<Content>Great Service at a Great Price I have stayed at this hotel twice, and I plan to continue using it for all my business trips to Tokyo. The rooms are clean, well-stocked with amenities, and, by Tokyo standards, quite spacious. The staff is exceedingly polite.I always opt for the Executive Floors, for four reasons:1. The Executive Lounge offers and excellent selection of snacks and beverages, and is a great way to unwind after work (trade show work in my case).2. The executive rooms have the USEN440 Satellite Radio. Now this is not a major thing, I know, but if you've never experienced Japanese Satellite Radio, you are in for a treat. You would be hard pressed to name a type of music that they haven't devoted a 24 hour station to, not to mention soundscapes, language lessons, and Auld Lang Syne (the Japanese signal that a place is closing).3. The breakfast buffet is included, and it's a good buffet. Certainly better than anything that passes for a breakfast buffet in the States.4. Free Internet. If you are like me, and have to check your email nearly constantly, then this is worth it. When you add the buffet and the Internet access to the mix, the price difference between the executive level and the other floors starts to look far less imposing.I recommend stepping outside and eating at one of the neighborhood restaurants for most of your meals. There is a good selection of restaurants nearby that cost much less than the ones in the hotel. If you want to go really cheap, there's a pretty good ramen place a few doors away that will only cost you around 700 Yen.The hotel is located in the Chuo-ku district, which puts it a little off the beaten path. If you are the kind of person who likes to step out the door into full Tokyo commotion, then this is not the hotel for you. The hotel is close to two of the major subway lines, so it is easy to get nearly anywhere from the hotel. One of these lines is directly under the hotel. The other is just a few blocks away.If you are a business traveler, and you find yourself stuck at hotels a lot, eating breakfast buffet food, and logging onto the computer at all hours, the Royal Park Hotel is a wonderful way to make a trip to Tokyo a lot less fatiguing.

<Content>You won't go wrong with Royal Park My husband and I stayed at the RPH during a 3-day trip to Tokyo. It's located in a more business district of Tokyo, but access to both metro and other train lines are walking distance. If you are looking to be in the middle of the scene, this is not the hotel for you. But if you want a nice base to explore Tokyo from, this is a solid choice.I was a little confused about the difference between the TAC (Tokyo Air Terminal) and Tokyo Central Train station. The TAC is a bus depot - it's attached to the RPH via a covered walk way. The busses to Narita are efficient (like every thing in Japan). However, if you take the train in from Narita, you will NOT arrive at the TAC, but rather at the Central Train Station. Its a 700 yen cab from the train station to the RPH.We were checked in promptly. I had requested a king/non-smoking room. The only one available was on the Executive Floor - so they kindly accommodated us. Except, they asked us not to use the executive lounge, which I thought was strange. The room was small (they had told us it would be at check-in) but for Japan hotels is was fine. Bed was comfortable. The bathroom mirror was heated so it never completely fogged up. The buffet downstairs has a huge selection of western food. Its pricey, but the food is good. Great Scott the basement bar is nice, quiet and a good spot for a drink if you arrive late. We had a little issue with the concierge initially, but when the assistant manager helped us - everything worked out.

<Content>Couldn't have been a better experience The Royal Park was something I lucked into. It happened to be the first on my approved corporate list and I know why. To get there, I got off at Narita and walked up to the Airport Limousine desk and asked for the bus to Tokyo City Air Terminal (TCAT). 10 minutes later I was on the bus being offered tips by an returning ex-pat Japanese. Less than an hour later I arrived at TCAT, read the little map there (there's a direct-connect phone if you need help) walked around the corner and was in the hotel in 5 more minutes. The staff was gracious and I was whisked to the executive check-in. They got me a drink and checked me in while I relaxed. The ONLY thing that bothered me was that the girl who checked me in was adamant about taking my bag which was probably as heavy as she was. She refused a tip showed me the hotel room (which included a full computer, 200 channel cable radio including a station that plays ONLY the Rocky theme), free internet, nice desk, comfortable bed and the world-famous toilet seat in the pristine bathroom.The views from the top floors are great, I didn't eat in the restaurants, except for the included breakfast buffet, which is OK. However, there's a little dumpling place just down the street - take a right out of the hotel, go a block, look for the yellow standing sign on the sidewalk, excellent goyza dumplings - that I ate at several times. Several convenience stores around for late night / early morning drinks, rice balls, etc. made it ideal for me.Other than being mortified about a young lady carrying my bag, everything about my experience here was excellent.

<Content>Great value Agree with most of the other reviews - reasonable price, good sized room and great service. If there is a downside it is how expensive the hotel restaurants are.The simple solution? Walk out the front door of the hotel and eat at any of the many restaurants slong this main road. I had a great sushi meal at Okaru - a sushi train sort of place. I ate more sushi than I should have and paid less than $10 US. Anyone who tells you Tokyo is an expensive place to eat has not checked out the sushi, ramen (noodle) and yakitori restaurants away from Ginza.

<Content>Close to perfection I stayed in the Royal Park for 4 weeks on a lengthy business trip. In short, this is probably the finest business hotel I have ever stayed in. A few of the things I loved: a nicely decorated, spacious room; a PC with free internet access (in the room); a metro station directly under the hotel; a nice selection of glasses in the room (tall, tumbler, wine etc.); great food from the many hotel restaurants; a wide range of toiletries; a fantastic shower; free use of a DVD playeror BOSE music system on request; 8 types of pillow to choose from (!) and finally, impeccable service from all the staff. If you are planning a trip to Tokyo, for business or pleasure, bypass all the obvious chain hotels and give this little gem a try.

<Content>Great Hotel for Family! We (wife and two kids) just got back from Japan (Tokyo) and we stayed at The Royal Park Hotel (RPH) for five nights. We were in Tokyo over the Thanksgiving week. The reviews from this site greatly influenced my decision in picking RPH and I am glad that I did. Every positive thing that was written about RPH is true and then some. After a 13 hour flight from the U.S., we arrived in Narita and took the Airport Limousine Bus from Narita to the T-CAT (Tokyo City Air Terminal). The Terminal is located adjacent to the Royal Park Hotel. I was pleasantlysurprised to see a dedicated phone for RPH as soon as we got out of the bus. Within 3-5 minutes of calling the hotel to inform then of ourarrival, a bell hop who speaks English arrived with a luggage cart to help us back to the hotel. I am starting to feel good about this hotel.We arrived at the hotel, which is connected to the T-CAT, and are promptly led to the executive lounge on the 16th floor to check in. Ah, yes, the executive floors. I took the advice of those that recommended the executive floors and, yes, the extra cost was more than worth it for my family. You can鈥檛 beat the convenience of a free buffet breakfast on the 20th floor and snacks and cocktails on the 16th floor executive lounge in the evening. With the price of food anddrinks in Tokyo, the difference in price is more than worth it. Add tothat the pampering and free access to the gym, pool, sauna, wireless internet in the executive lounge, etc鈥?br/>Our room was very nice and roomy even by American standards. It was very comfortable and we were able to adjust the thermostat. We had an executive twin suite with two twin beds and an extra bed. We had to pay an additional 5,000 yen ($47 approx) per night for the extra bed. The cost of the extra bed is worth it considering the alternative of having to pay for an additional room. My kids are still very young so it was comfortable for us. The room had a Dell computer with free highspeed internet service. I was also able access the internet with my laptop by connecting it to the Ethernet wire. The kids were able to access their internet games on the Dell computer while the wife and were able to surf the net on the laptop. The bathroom was nice and comfortable. I had mentally prepared myself for a very small bathroom based on some of the previous reviews, but it was okay as long as it was one person in there at a time. The Toto toilet is the bomb. The toilet seat is warm and it comes with a 鈥渟hower鈥?and bidet. Getting around town is easy from RPH. There is a train line under the hotel and access to the Tokyo rail system is only 5 minutes walk from the hotel. We were able to buy 2 day tourist rail passes at the front desk. The front desk staff is very nice and they were able to give us good directions and tips on using the Tokyo Metro Rail. This is the most economic way to explore Tokyo. The trains run on time and there is a train every 5 minutes or so. We were able to go to Tokyo Disney, Ginza, Roppongi, Ueno, and Akihabara. There are several convenience stores and Japanese restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. There is a McDonalds within 5 minutes walk of the hotel. Overall, this is a very nice hotel for the price. The location is convenient for getting around Tokyo. The staff was very pleasant and nice and most of them speak English. I am recommending this hotel veryhighly and will definitely be staying at the RPH next time I am in Tokyo.

<Content>Not outstanding,but one of the most comfortable hotels in Japan! I have ever stayed at Royal Park Hotel twIce.I reserved exective floor each time.Room type was deluxe twin.It looks out of Asakusa and Ueno area .Though a vIew of room which I have stayed was not so good, Room was large and very comftable.Desk top Computer was equipped on the writing desk in advance.We could use complementary Internet access.There were stapler , highlighter and paper clips in desk.I think it is useful for person on business.Club lounge is located on the 16th floor.People help themselves to food and soft drink.I was pleased with changpaine .It's pretty good.20th floor is bar lounge,it looks out of Tokyo Tower.It's nice view.If you stay Club Floor,you can eat breakfast here,and you can stay by 3 p.m. Staff are very helpful.Though I stayed alone, I had a good time .锛╫tel is close to TCAT and hakozaki ramp.If you stay at Royal Park,parking is free of charge up to thirty hours.锛磆ere are not so many hotel in Tokyo that parking is free of charge.I often go to hotels by car. It's really good.Royal Park is one of my favorite hotel in Japan!I

<Content>Excellent Park Royal Very spacious and well located.Warmly greeted after very long journey and reservation handled promptly  efficiently.Room was well equipped and very spacious for Tokyo.Vast selection of restaurants with various types of cuisine and a pre-dinner drink in the top floor bar afforded a superb view.Fitness facilities were also excellent.In every aspect service from all staff was attentive and courteous and what did help was good english by front-desk  bell captain for guides to city and locations.Scotts bar was a well used refuge but I would point out drinks are expensive!!Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and intend to return.

<Content>Great Hotel!! One of the main reasons I stayed at this hotel was because of the amount of reviews it recieved. Everything you read is correct! The hotel is great! It has a train station on the lower level of the hotel! Easy way to travel, and staff is very nice! They upgraded my husband and I to a higher quality room because we were honeymooners and they gave us free breakfast coupons. I also read on the previous reviews that when you become an i prefer member you recieve free internet access as well. Before you book your stay become a member so you get that benefit. I really had no complaints about this hotel. It's Clean, Friendly, and Convinient!

<Content>Highly Recommended Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough - a jewel for travellers to Tokyo. We spent our last night in Japan there after touring the country for two weeks, and could not have been happier with the experience, from check-in to the in-room amenities, this is a first class hotel suitable for tourists and business travellers alike. The proximity to the TCAT makes it a breeze for arrivals and departures for Narita and Haneda, and the Hanzomon subway line is almost literally outside the front door - which makes up for the fact that there is little in the way of dining or sight-seeing right around the premises. Great facilities and amazing staff.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great location I have just returned from four nights in Tokyo and have to commend the Royal Park HotelThe hotel is attached by an overhead walkway to the TCAT - Tokyo City Air Terminal. This is where all the Friendly Limousine bus services to and from the both Narita and Henada airports terminate.Meaning having spent a stress free hour getting into the city, you dont then have to join the masses on the Tokyo subway getting to your hotel (cost of bus to Narita Y2900) The Underground station under the Hotel is Z10 on Hanzomon line which with a two day Tokyo Metro pass we found to be ideal for getting anywhere.On arrival we where sent to the the executive check in on the 16th Floor. I would recomend you look at paying the difference for this as it includes not only a complimentry breakfast served in the 20th Floor Sky bar , free internet access in your room, free access to the Pool and gym but also access to a three hour complimentry bar each evening in the Executive lounge.The room was small by international standards but this is the norm in Tokyo and didnt detract from the experiance.The staff in the executive lounge spoke perfect English and where always keen to assist providing everything from Train times to rudimentry Japaneese lessonsSo if your heading for Tokyo I have no doubt you could do much worse than this hotel

<Content>Royal Park Hotel - upscale hotel - easy subway and bus access We stayed at the Royal Park Hotel in July 2007. I would recommend this hotel for anyone and I would stay here again anytime.We followed the advise of another TA member and joined their club (free of charge) and we decided to upgrade our room to the executive level. We received a great suprise when we arrived - as the room rate was dropped by 30%. The executive floor rooms offer free full breakfast (western and japanese style), free access to the in-house gym, executive lounge access with complimentary happy-hour nightly with a well stocked bar (I had champagne every night). I completed their club application, which they had to mail to me, and in order to cut-down on processing time I decided to scan the application and emailed it to them. They had our membership package, with club card, ready for us upon check-in. Check-in for the executive floors is handled at the executive floor lounge.It's a nice upscale hotel with over 1/2 doz restaurants. They have an in-house gym with good equipment and a yoga/stretching room as well. I don't remember seeing a pool. The provide in-house massages (my husband swears is the best massage he's ever had).The staff was wonderful - at every level (not just executive floors). They were caring and very helpful (suggesting nearby restaurants), providing customized maps for us.Rooms are well appointed with the usual amenities you expect in an upscale hotel (robes, slippers, minibar etc)Restaurants; they have several restaurants and lounges throughout the hotel. Some more upscale than others - all with different cuisines.There is a subway entrance attached to the hotel and across the street is the Tokyo Air Terminal Bus Station - which also has a corridor connecting it to this hotel)At our departure, we needed to get a bus to Narita Tokyo airport and they had 2 staff members assist us to the bus terminal (access directly from the hotel). Again, if you can upgrade to the executive floors - the perks are worth the price and may actually save you money if you add up all that you'd have to pay for if you stayed in the other floors. Make sure to join their club to get a room discount and perks.Enjoy.

<Content>Quality hotel We stayed in the RPH for five nights in July and found the overall hotel excellant.As we were travelling with our children I requetsed two non smoking rooms adjacent to each other - we got interconnecting rooms which was great. I requested an early check in - we did have to wait an hour for the room, but it gave us time to have something to eat before having a sleep after a long flight from Ireland.I joined the Summit club, of which the hotel is a member (I actually booked the stay with them, as their rates were a lot better than the hotel itself) and was happily surprised with a gift of a bottle of wine per room for being a I Prefer member. As a member one is also entitled to free use of the pool, sauna, gym. The link to the Summit Group is on the hotel web site.The buffet breakfast was very good and gave everyone an oppertunity to sample japanese breakfast food as well as the usual western food. The one issue I have is that I would have loved a large cup of coffee in the mornings....not small cups that have to be refilled over and over again.With all the choices in Tokyo, we didn't eat dinner in the hotel so I cannot comment on the restaurants.One of the main reasons for choosing the hotel was the swimming pool. We were staying duing the rain that accompanied the recent typhoon, so my daughter made great use of the pool in the evenings since we didn't fancy walking around in the rain after a day of doing just that.The hotel is connected directly to the metro, so accessing places is very easy. There were always taxi's outside also should one wish to use them. And of course the hotel is beside the airport express bus station (TCAT) so the trip from the airport was easy.I would recommend this hotel to both business and leisure travellers.

<Content>A great find. A perfect hotel for a good rate. My wife and I had an unexpected two day stay in Tokyo and were pressed to find a good, reasonably-priced hotel in a hurry. We found this place via Expedia and read a lot of good reviews at TripAdvisor and were convinced. We were happy to find that the praise was well deserved. The place was well located next to the downtown Air Terminal (which made it easy for us to get to and from Narita Airport via an express, direct bus). The room itself was very clean and comfortable. The staff were very professional and helpful. All-in-all, it was a great value, a great location, and a gem of a hotel. We highly recommend it.

<Content>value for money Stayed 5 nights at RPH at end July. I had 2 separate reservations due to different room rates - I called the hotel directly to book a single room for the first night and used the corporate deal for the rest. The rate showed on the website was cheaper than the one which the hotel offered. The reservation staff who could speak native English explained that they were under different reservation quotas (The hotel itself and Summit Hotel Group Reservation), and she could not give me the rate showed on the website. I expressed my disagreement and finally she offered me a rate which was lower than the one I found on the website and with BBF (I thought it's 21000 yen inclusive tax versus 22000 yen inclusive tax without BBF).I arrived at about 11pm in the evening. Check-in was smooth and fast (within 5 minutes). The single room was huge, clean and with a good quality of double bed (about 4 feet width). I also found a set of Shiseido facial product, a bag of Japanese hot spring powder and a set of toiletries for men at the bathroom. Every room had a Dell desktop with TV monitor for the guest use. I moved to the another room with twin beds next day. But the room size was slightly smaller than the single room I got last night, particularly it's with 2 standard single beds. There's only a set of men toiletries at the bathroom. Besides, set up was the same as single room. Internet access was fast and smooth. I used my own laptop and hotel's desktop somtimes if I just wanted to check something on the web and update news. Room service was fast (within 20 minutes) and the meal was not too bad. They also tried to fulfill our request of French Fries which they did not offer. I found they did not charge internet access on my bill, it's probably it's included on my corporate deal. But I am so happy to get a in-room computer so that I can access it whenever I wanted to. Concierge provided excellent service - wrapping service, helping us bring our luggages to the T-CAT Terminal. Overall, RPH is a standard business hotel with a touch of surprise. The only downside is it's not close to the shopping areas, such as Ginza, Shinjuka and Shibuya.

<Content>The best Real luxury. I cannot fault this hotel. My room was spotlessly clean and very confortable. The staff were great and my meal in the French Restaurant was exellent. I cannot really comment on the location as I was only on a stop over. The price seemed very reasonable.

<Content>great room, staff and location ! Me and my partner stayed for a week at the executive level. The included lounge and breakfast were well work the extra cost. The airport shuttle and metro entrance both situated directly under the hotel greatly Simplified our trips to all parts of the city.Wifi was free in the executive lounge but not available elsewhere. Executive rooms all have free broadband (network cable is in the room).

<Content>Highly recommended My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Royal Park Hotel in October 2006. We stayed on the executive floor, which I highly recommend. The front desk staff promptly guided us to another floor where we were smoothly and quickly checked in. The room was spacious by Tokyo standards. Our room had a seating area with a love seat and coffee table. The decor was modern and comfortable. There was also a well-lit vanity. The bathroom was a very decent size with a modern shower/bath. Breakfast for those staying on the executive floor was on one of the upper floors and had a very nice buffet and an omelet chef. Breakfastservice was prompt and friendly and the food was quite good. The location is also worth mentioning. It is in a very shitamachi type area--a pleasant, old Tokyo neighborhood. The Suitengumae metro stop on the Hanzomon Line is less than a five-minute walk. It is neither central like Tokyo Station or Ginza, but neither is it too far from the major sites. We found the location to be convenient and quiet at the same time.

<Content>Excellent Choice! My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights on our most recent trip to Tokyo. I am so glad we did! The hotel was attached to the TCAT (Tokyo City Air Terminal) which has direct limousine bus service from Narita airport (50 minutes). We upgraded to the Executive Floor which gave us a nice room on the 18th floor with sweeping views of the city skyline. The Executive Floor option, which was a few dollars more than a standard room, gave us access to the Executive Lounge on the 16th floor. They have a full-time concierge there who was very helpful and very friendly. We had access to a full American-style breakfast in the morning on the 20th floor (complimetary) which included a stunning view and cooked-to-order eggs and good coffee! In the evening, they had small appetizers and a nice selection of cocktails and wines available for you. The room was small, but the ammenities were nice, including an in-room personal computer with free internet access (wireless was available if you opt to use your own laptop -free too!). The service and staff was excellent. Always a smile and a bow. As a gay couple, I never once felt uncomfortable and the Japanese went out of their way to make certain we were comfortable as well. The hotel is on the Hanzomon line with easy connections to all the other lines and with the subway in the basement of the hotel, travel was very easy. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great hotel in a great location! Would definitely stay again.

<Content>Great Hotel My wife and myself have just spent six nights at The Royal Park Hotel. From start to finish we had superb service throughout the hotel. Admitted it's not the cheapest, but I think for Tokyo it represented good value. Very well positioned, with direct access to the metro system, and direct coach link to Narita airport.We had an exective double, (two flat screen tv's!!) 24hr free internet access. The only complaint I can think of is the small size of the bathroom, but the high standard of bathroom toiletries and towels more than made up for it's size. (and the loo seat!! OMG!) I would highly recommend this hotel.
