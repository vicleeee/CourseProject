<Content>Highly recommended We used primarily Starwood points to pay for our stay. We had two rooms just down the hall from each other, one overlooking the Arno. I think the river view would have been more enjoyable in the summertime, as it was too cold to stand out on the balcony and look around. The river side did have some noise from the street below. The room across the hall had no noise at at all.The hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk from the train station - but make sure to get directions. Lots of people wheeling luggage around Florence. The hotel rooms were very pretty, clean and comfortable. We liked the atmosphere of the hotel, a very old world feel to it. The concierge was helpful and made our dinner reservations that we requested via email before we arrived. Stay at the Westin if you can!

<Content>westin florence delivers in westin style ! we stayed at the westin florence for our first marriage anniversary.. loved the room.. we had a 4 poster bed with drapes all over.. perfect !! huge bathroom.. all in all 10 / 10 for the room.. only problem.. there is some modification work going on on the hotel so there are scaffoldings on the rear side and some hammering noises in the morning.. so people staying in during the afternoon be advised.. not the quitest experience to be had..in any case.. i am sure if i had requested the lovely staff they would have changed my room.but i did not bother as were out of the hotel first thing in the morning..which brings me to the breakfast.. as the previous reviewer pointed out.. disappointed with the breakfast.. room tariff's are high for this hotel even for off season like november and should ideally include breakfast.. however it doesnt.. my wife did decide to take the full blown buffet breakfast one morning and it was below our level of expectation (at 35 euro its overpriced for the selection it offered -- again no live counter for ANYTHING..not expected of a westin atleast)..location of hotel is good..duomo and the main areas are close by.. the uffizi is walking distance and so is the pontevecchio.. the train station is walking distance too..so i would beg to differ with previous reviewer.. i think location is excellent !! we took a day trip to leaning tower of pisa.. i would highly recommmend everyone to take it...excellent service by the trains (every half hour till business hours). the pisa complex is beautiful and i recommend coming back by afternoon as nothing much beyond the piazza..and oh!! the hotel staff was particularly nice to us on our anniversary night!! we got a complimentary magnum of reisling and they got it delivered to the room with some chocolate cake.. just goes to show that you cant really go wring with the westin for somethings that money cant buy !!!enjoy your stay!!

<Content>Hard to review First of all let me say that the staff at this hotel were extremely pleasant, friendly and helpful, they get 5 stars. Upon arrival the doorman took our luggage and escorted us to the reception, the reception staff were very friendly and later on the concierge (Nick) made a restaurant recommendation and booking for us and when he next saw us took the trouble to ask how it had been.We had booked a river view deluxe, on booking in we were told we had been upgraded, not sure what to but the room looked amazingly like what a river view deluxe was described as, maybe it was larger, I don't honestly know.First impressions of the room were positive, good size and with the wardrobes in a little alcove that led to the bathroom. The bed was comfortable and the little balcony gave delightful views of the river.Closer inspection of the room showed some black marks on the walls, probably from the air conditioning. The room could not however be described as unclean.There were some nice touches, little bedmats at the turn down service, two suitcase stands.As it was the end of October it got a little chilly, the heating was very poor, in fact all you could do was turn up the temperature of the air conditioning, it therefore took a long long time for the temperature to rise, I dread to think of what it is like in the depths of winter.The bathroom was a good size, but the shower was somewhat complicated, who wants three shower heads and the task of working out how to get water out of the desired one first thing in the morning?Location wise the hotel is not brilliant, there are very few places to eat in the vicinity, even though one of them was the excellent Il Profeta. There is one little gem on the doorstep of the hotel though, the Ognissanti church, it is beautiful inside and contains the last resting place of Botacelli.For the price you pay to stay here it is a bit much for breakfast not to be included, and at éˆ§?0 each for a coffee and a croissant we didn't feel tempted to pay the extra.We enjoyed our stay, and have no real quibbles with the hotel it is just that at the price they charge it does not really give value. It is a shame, as with breakfast included and a better heating system I would have given them a much better rating.

<Content>Perfect place in Florence The hotel is on the river and about 8 minute walk from the Duomo.The hotel is elegant, quiet and sophisticated. The check-in staff were excellent as were the chambermaids. The rooms were clean, large, smart and contain all you could ask for. We were in a river view room and if it is possible, always ask for one of these as the view is spectacular especially in the morning when you open the curtains and the sun is shining.The concierge ewas efficient albeit a little stuffy.There is a lack of facilities such as a swimming pool and sauna, but as we were there only for a weekend, we probably wouldn't have used it anyway.The only criticism is the lack of complimentary wi-fi which we were told was available in the lobby. It is unacceptable that a five-star hotel in today's age does not provide free wireless internet access.In short however, the hotel compliments the city wich is beautiful and well worth the visit.

<Content>Great Location The location of the hotel is great because it is right on the water and it is easy to find your way back. It is also close to most of the tourist sites. The room we had was great and it had amazing views of the city. The lobby area is nice and the hotel is very classy overall. Across the street at a sister hotel is a very good restaurant.

<Content>Wonderful hotel/stay Just returned from my second stay at the Westin and was every bit as impressed as I had been a few years back. This is a beautiful and beautifully run property, right on the Arno. Great high ceilings, very clean, comfortable beds -- all the luxuries you'd expect -- and a magnificent balcony view of the river, the Ponte Vecchio, the Pitti Palace and incredible sunsets.It's a few blocks further than some other fine properties on the river -- the Lungarno Suites come to mind, although I've not stayed there. But this hotel has the atmosphere that we wanted in Florence (vs newer but more sterile properties). Terrific service.For first time visitors, you have 3 real choices in terms of top tier hotel properties: 1) hotels in the old center of the city (eg Hellvetia  Bristol) where you stumble out of bed right into the midst of the incredible historic squares/sites, 2) hotels on the other side of the Arno where it's more peaceful but a bit further to walk and 3) the hotels on the Arno like the Excelsior. It's a personal preference, but I like #3 as a kind of best of all worlds option. (The Four Seasons just seems too far out of the way for our taste.)Can't think of a constructive criticism at this point. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great place to stay! Stayed at this hotel on the beautiful Arno with family, including 3 kids. The location is wonderful - just minutes from major sights. The concierge service was the best I have ever experienced, more than going the extra mile to ensure that our time in Florence was stress free. Rooms were large and clean. We had rooms overlooking the Arno with Juliet balconies so we could enjoy that magical light as the sun set. Would definitely stay here again. Only downside was parking....they do not have their own parking so for the 5 nights we were there, parking in a public lot would have cost ~$400 CND!!! Fortunately, the concierge staff allowed us to park in front of the hotel with just a token thank you.

<Content>Absolutely Perfect My wife and I were visiting Italy as part on my 40th birthday celebration (in mid August, 2008). As part of this celebration, we spent three nights at the Westin Excelsior (Room 446) in Florence. Our stay was absolutely perfect. From the time we checked in until the time we left, we just loved our stay (both in Florence  in this hotel). The hotel is within a 15 minute walk from the main train station (Santa Maria Novella) and an even shorter taxi ride! We arrived at the hotel around noon (we arrived in Florence via train from Rome). Checking in was pleasant  convenient. Because we arrived early, our room was not ready - so we took the opportunity to leave our bags and head for lunch. We found a nice (and reasonable) cafe on Piazza della Repubblica (a ten minute walk from the hotel). After lunch, we returned to the hotel and were assigned a room. I am not sure if they upgraded us (because our room was not ready when we arrived) or if we received the room we originally reserved - but either way it was fantastic. The room was very spacious, very clean, and had an elegant feel. The bathroom was huge with dual sink basins. There were two small balconies attached to the room - one in the bedroom area and one in the bathroom. The balconies were large enough for just one person - but they provided a wonderful view of the Arno river. The room was quiet and the bed was comfortable so we were able to sleep very well (the hotel itself was very calm and quiet). Our room rate did not include breakfast so we ate in the city center each morning (which we would recommend). Without a doubt, my wife and I would recommend the Westin Excelsior. Of the five hotels (all 5 star hotels) we stayed in during our trip to Italy, this was by far our favorite.

<Content>You will not be disappointed This hotel is just great and its location ideal. Right in the middle of the city and within walking distance of all major city attractions. Rooms are classy and decorated with taste in a fine Italian 19th century style. The hotel itself is luxurious and the staff really professional. Like I said, there is nothing to complain about. This hotel is really up to its 5* reputation.

<Content>Warm, wonderful experience My husand and I spent 4 wonderful days in Florence and stayed at the Westin Excelsior. From front-desk check in to being seated at dinner, the staff welcomed us with open arms. Having traveled quite extensively, I thought I'd seen hospitality, but what we experienced at the Westin was beyond our expectations. Our room was plentiful in both size and ambiance. Normally I don't sleep well when we travel, but the mattress/bed was perfect. The restaurant / bar had a wonderful broad menu. We happened to be visiting during Carnival (their halloween) and the entire hotel was completely transformed into a true carnival, streamers, the whole 9 yards. It made our trip all the more magical.We enjoyed our stay so much the day before we were to leave we approached the front desk and asked if we could extend our stay another day. She never flinched - clicked the computer a few times and said ok - you're in!I can't Wait to go back!

<Content>Disappointed, not the best Westin We used points to stay at the Westin and, for the points that we spent, we were disappointed. No amenities like free breakfast (which many hotels in Italy provide) and the conceirges were not very helpful. For example, we asked them to call a local number to confirm the pick up location of a wine tour we signed up for and, instead of assisting, they sent us over to the hotel across the street to use the business center which charged to use the phone - I believe it was 7 euro - for a 1 minute call. Bottomline, save your points and use them somewhere else where they go further.

<Content>Truly a 5-star My wife stayed at the Westin Excelsior in Florence in mid-May 2008 after 4 days in Rome and 3 days in Venice. The hotel sits on the banks of the Arno river, just down the road from the Ponte Vechio and an easy walk to all of the major sights in Florence. We were upgraded to a river-view room with high ceilings and a stunning view. The concierge and reception were professional but friendly and helpful. The concierge actually refused a trip after helping us with dinner and tour recommendations. Room service was excellent and punctual. Wake-up calls were made exactly on time. The hotel bar was filled every night and a live piano singer provided the entertainment. Don't be intimidated by the pricetag for this hotel...it's well worth the extra to stay in a place like this. Florence and the Westin were the highlights of our trip to Italy.

<Content>Nothing to Complain About I stayed here for two nights in May. This is a great Westin, one of the best I have stayed in. The hotel is located right on the river, within walking distance of all the sights in central Florence. The front desk and concierge were great. The room was very comfortable. Just note that room sizes vary. I was with a group and we had 3 rooms, all with different layouts and sizes. A great hotel, no complaints.

<Content>Wonderful time at the Excelsior! We had been referred to the Westin Excelsior, and we were not disappointed! We loved everything about it! close enough to walk to everything, but just a bit outside the noise and chaos! We overlooked the lovely River Arno, and the rooms and bathrooms are lovely! Staff is very helpful...top notch in every way! Would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Worth the extra... This was the last hotel of our Honeymoon trip. We had initially booked into the Davanzati after reading the great reviews here (Nice Hotel, Great Host but VERY VERY uncomfortable bed). From the minute we checked in to the Excelsior, it was glorious. Historic building, great foyer, we stayed in a junior suite - HUGE bathroom - all marble. Just felt so comfortable and luxurious. Bed was great. The only thing about Florence is that there is so much to do that you should not stay in your hotel room unless you're sleeping. get out and about.From that respect, some people may opt for cheaper places. Not me. I will return to this hotel if we go back to Florence again. It's worth it if you can afford it. I'm not really fussy but I like a good bed and good, quiet air conditioning. Restaurant was great too with the Sommelier so attentive. Order a good bottle of wine and you practically get a side-show as the Sommelier attends you and partakes in the tasting.As we were touring around Tuscany, we had a hire car but as most of Florence is Pedestrianised, you are much better off without a car. It is easy to get around by foot. Our Concierge arranged for the car to be taken to a garage for our stay and it was delivered back to us within 20 mins of requesting it.we initially booked in for one night but extended our stay to 3 nights (at the expense of Bologna - which we found to be a great decision) when we liked it so much.Highly recommended.

<Content>Absolutely Amazing Hotel  We have traveling extensively and this is definitely the most luxurious, beautiful hotel we have ever stayed in! From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty, which was a pleasant surprise as we were traveling as a family with teenagers and a grandfather. The staff was completely courteous and very knowledgeable. The hotel was elegance beyond belief. The rooms, the bathrooms, the lounge,everything! The website photos do not exaggerate a bit. The location also was perfect, Ponte Vecchio right outside the window, all types of shops,cafes, galleries and more!Bring plenty of Euro as this is definitely THE place to shop in Italy!We will be returning to the Excelsior simply to soak in the splendor of Firenze!

<Content>Fabulous! My husband and I celebrated our 5th wedding anniversary with a trip to Venice and Florence. We used cash  points to stay at the Westin's fabulous Europa  Regina in Venice, and the even more fabulous Excelsior in Florence. The hotel was stunning, and the staff was more than accomodating. Our first night, we were in a room just over the lobby. It had a huge balcony -- so that was nice. It was a bit noisy, however, so we asked to be moved the next day. They moved us to a fantastic room overlooking the Arno river. What a great hotel and location. It was definitely a highlight of our trip!

<Content>The Westin Excelsior Florence - lovely and romantic!! We arrived at the Westin after our long international flight and were greeted very warmly by the staff...and were upgraded to a lovely junior suite overlooking the Arno! I can't think of a bad thing to say about this hotel. Everything was lovely. We walked everywhere, including a (thankfully) brief walk to the train station with our bags. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a romantic and quiet spot in the heart of Florence!

<Content>Can't imagine staying anywhere else in Florence This hotel transports you to another era of true elegance, grandeur and beauty (like Florence itself) but all in an uderstated and classy way and with the luxury and comfort of a modern 5 star.What also sets this hotel apart from others is the staff- especially the concierge who will do almost anything for you (they searched every electronics store in florence for a nintendo wii for my kids) and are a wealth of local knowledge.I love the balcony views and the location and the room and the breakfast and even the cute gym. I love everything about this hotel and can recommend it without hesitation.

<Content>Old school glamour We have just returned from a week at the Excelsior in Florence and it was a fantastic experience. The hotel is not flashy or loud but true old style glamour. What made a real impression on us however was the staff, all of whom took pride in their jobs. The receptionists, the concierge, the bar staff were all charming and efficient. The rooms were large and the bathrooms beautiful. And the location is without question the best in Florence. A wonderful holiday.

<Content>Faultless In Florence I arrived 30 minutes before check in time but was warmly greeted at Reception. A first - the person who checked me in then took me to my room. I had been upgraded to a WorkOut Room. This is very modern with running machine (not used) and weights and a complimentary bottle of Chianti for me (used!) I was offered an alternative if I wished, but although different it was lovely -on a split level with 3 high level windows overlooking the rooftops of Florence. The Heavenly King Bed was just that - heavenly! It was very quiet and akin to having my own apartment in Florence (this room is not typical I would imagine - others appear more traditional though equally special).I had a two course meal on room service which at 45 Euros including all service charges I thought was reasonable (the quality was excellent).Breakfast isn't cheap (but I reserved in advance at 27 Euros). There is a huge choice though at the buffet. As I was returning to Pisa airport on the day of a train strike the person checking me in obtained all details of an alternative Terravision 'bus service which the conciege could sort out.I could continue but suffice to say I have never received such personal service from a large hotel. From check in to check out I felt I was in an oasis of calm and friendliness. The hotel is around a 5 minute walk to the train and 'bus station and around the same to the main sites (though longer if you stop for delicious ice cream en route!)

<Content>Gorgeous We used points to book this hotel, a lot of points, but it was worth it. Amazingly comfortable beds. A great staff. A FANTASTIC location. Gorgeous rooms. The concierge was even able to get us reservations for Uffizi and Accademia the day before - on a weekend! We were upgraded to an Arno view room and it was very nice. I used the bathtub more than once to help recover from days of heavy walking. Fantastic service overall.

<Content>Classy and Deserving of Awards The Westin Excelsior is everything you expect an urban luxury property to be and a bit more. My husband and I spent 4 nights of our honeymoon at the hotel (3 on SPG points, 1 paid) and we were impressed with everything from the room to the concierge. We booked a regular room through Starwood but told the operator it was our honeymoon. When we arrived at the property, we found out we had been upgraded to a riverfront suite with a balcony. We came back from dinner the first night to a red heart of rose petals on our bed and a bottle of champagne chilling with best wishes from the manager. The concierge staff deserves special mention. They were flawless with restaurant recommendations, getting museum tickets, and helping us ship wine back to the US. I spend alot of nights at Starwood properties because of work and this Westin is a step above any of the other Westins or W's I have visited. It's expensive but worth it. Give it a try!

<Content>As good as it gets We were given a beautiful room with a large balcony with a table and chairs overlooking the courtyard in the front of the hotel and the Arno. The rooms are huge and classy with top of the line furnishings and linens. Service at this hotel is fantastic, as was the food from room service (excellent fish that was reasonably priced). They also provided a complimentary bottle of wine (worth 37 euros on their menu).Highly recommended.

<Content>Great hotel My husband and I stayed here for 3 night during our honeymoon in September. I am a Starwood member so I received an upgrade upon my arrival. The room was huge - one of the biggest I have ever stayed in all of Europe. We were in room 430 and had a king sized bed, big bathroom and a balcony with views of the Arno and Ponte Vecchio. We got the honeymoon package which included breakfast in our room every day - a little annoying to have to schedule it every day so I would recommend going to the restuarant instead. The location was good - a little further away from the center of town which was good because it wasn't as loud and crowded. The staff was unbelievable - they shipped a bunch of our gifts we had purchase home (we received them all carefully wrapped and undamaged). They also arranged for an in-room massage in 40 minutes after the service wasn't offered anymore for the day. The hotel is wonderful but a little expensive considering some of the other values and great hotels in Italy.

<Content>Nice but expensive Stayed at the Westin Excelsior at the beginning of October. I am a Starwood member and they upgraded us to a large room overlooking the Arno and included a free bottle of wine. It was a wonderful room, very elegant. The concierge staff was very helpful with various questions prior to my arrival as well as restaurant reservations etc. Housekeeping was a bit sloppy considering it's a 5 star - left wet cleaning rags on the night stands, used floor mats on the chairs. Good location, a little bit of a walk to the center but not far. Fairly expensive - Should include breakfast at those prices. Overall a very nice hotel.

<Content>Amazing hotel This hotel was recommended from a travel agent and it was worth every penny. Although our room did not have a river view, it was still beautiful and large. We had a dressing area and a large marble bathroom. The best part though was probably the Westin bed, which unlike others we slept in during our trip, was fantastic for sleeping off all that red wine the night before. The staff was very helpful with restaurants and directions. The location is also great!

<Content>Elegance on the Arno! We had a great 3-night stay at the Westin Excelsior in mid-September. This is everything a deluxe hotel in a city should be. Although we were staying on a combination of free and discounted nights through the Starwood program, we were upgraded to a river-view room with two balconies overlooking the Arno. (I am a Starwood Gold member.) The view was particularly nice just before sunset, when the fading light turned the buildings across the river (as well as the Ponte de Vecchio) such warm Tuscan colors. The room was elegant, with very tall ceilings, Old World dèŒ…cor, and a lovely marble bath. Although our room was a bit smaller than others in the hotel, it was spacious enough for two. The hotel's lobby is very attractive, as is the newly-renovated restaurant and bar area. I was amazed at how well the more modern decor of the bar and restaurant blended with the grand, historical style of the existing building, but somehow it worked very well. Every evening, musicians played the piano and saxophone in the bar, and we enjoyed simply sitting in the lobby listening to the music and soaking up the elegant atmosphere before heading off to dinner.  Although the hotel offered a big breakfast (for 35 Euros each), we did breakfast the Italian way, with coffee and croissants at a small bar about a block down the street from the hotel. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the Piazza Signoria, slightly more to the Duomo or the Pitti Palace, and a bit less to the main shopping area. The concierge made Uffizzi and Accademia reservations for us (and sold us tickets for the Hop-on-Hop-off Bus), but be aware that you will pay more for these than if you booked them directly.  This was my second stay at the Excelsior, and it keeps getting even better. Truly a grand hotel!

<Content>Beautiful hotel on the Arno River... Had a 2 night stay at The Westin Excelsior Florence. Liked the location and able to walk to all. We are Gold Starwood members.Upgraded to a very large room with a large outdoor patio/deck overlooking the Arno. This was really a treat for us. Able to sit outide and enjoy the views and relax after a triring day of walking the city.Very nice, comfortable room.Breakfast was costly 40+ Euro so we did the a la carte menu. We were not too hungry after the traditional late dinners. We LOVE our dinner at Profeta(recommended by Concierge) short walk from hotel. Highly recommened it. Great food and very friendly service.Although you can walk to everything it is a long walk back when you are hot and tired. We were there only two days so we did not figure out how to use their buses. Told that the small bus that passes the hotel only runs along the river. May want to check with staff about how to use public transportation or use Hop on Hop off bus? Helpful staff/conceirge. Was upset though. Left my diary of Italy trip in room. Despite my repeated efforts to have them check with housekeeping and the room, was never found. I suspect housekeeping threw it away. Would recommend a stay here, especially if you are a Starwood member and can use your points. Can contact with any questions.

<Content>Nice property My wife and I stayed at the The Westin Excelsior, Florence for 3 nights in mid July, 2007. We booked a river view room with an additional room next door for our college aged daughter. Both rooms were clean and had comfortable beds and furniture. The river view was a bit disappointing. Small window, but OK as the river looked more like a sewage canal at that point in its travel.The property is a pretty, old structure that fronts a piazza and is across from the Grand Hotel. It was hot in Florence, but the a/c in the rooms kept up quite nicely. I found the front desk staff and the concierge to be friendly and helpful. We never ate at the restaurant, but the bar staff was nice and the service was prompt. We asked for and were provided recommendations for dinner all 3 nights. Each was excellent and within a few blocks of the hotel.The hotel is pricey, but generally worth it. I'd stay there again.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel We had a fantastic stay at the Excelsior!Expedia made a mess of our booking at the Grand Hotel (same chain, located across the square) which was to be closed - although they were informed in June, they didn't think to tell us until we were on the train to Florence from Pisa, having flown from the UK.We were moved to the Excelsior and it was just fabulous. The front desk staff went out of their way to make sure that we were happy (and calm, after trying to deal with Expedia). The rooms were stunning - we had a deluxe room with a balcony overlooking the River Arno. A beautiful view to wake up to on a warm summer morning. If we looked to the left we could see the Ponte Vecchio.All the staff on the Concierge desk were great - sorting out short notice bookings for us at the Uffizi and with a reservation for dinner at the Villa la Vedetta on our wedding anniversary which earned me brownie points / extra credit (we ate on the terrace overlooking the city at sunset).The restaurant staff at the Excelsior were great as well - very friendly and attentive and didn't even flinch when my wife wanted caffe latte after her evening meal! The food was really good too.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and look forward to going back again.

<Content>The Excelsior was truly wonderful! Everything about the Westin Excelsior was wonderful - the service people (the doorman, the front desk personnel and concierge, room service personnel) the delightful location, the beautiful and very comfortable room and bathroom. We had just come from an unhappy experience at another Starwood facility (the Gritti Palace in Venice) and the Excelsior was a reminder that, yes indeed, there are wonderful hotels in the world!

<Content>Not Worth the Money Positives: great location on the Arno, a short walk to most anything, a very helpful and knowledgeable concierge staff, nice furnishings in the common areas (Renaissance Florentine), a nice gym, a business center with free internet.Negatives: we expected more from the rooms themselves, the tub and walls had damaged spots, the A/C didn't work very well, we felt like we were nickel and dimed by the hotel. When we checked in, they charged me an extra 25 euro per night for having my wife in the room (they did the same to my parents for their room). They wouldn't bring an iron up to the room  said we had to use their pressing service for clothes to be ironed. Overall, not a bad experience with the hotel, we just expected a little more for what we paid.

<Content>Loved the Excelsior The rooms were fabulous!! The concierges were the best I have ever experienced. They booked side trips that were first class and the restaurants they recommeded were great. The location of the hotel was a few blocks from the heart of everything. We liked this because it was quiet and not many people around. The walk was a very easy walk to everything we wanted to see. It was very safe around our hotel for 2 women walking alone. Ate at the hotel for breakfast every morning and it was good. The service at the Excelsior was excellent!! Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who travels frequently and expects the best. Will stay there again when in Florence.

<Content>Great Location The Westin is right off of the Arno River and a short walk from the heart of Florence. The hotel itself is very nice and clean. The room was great, but a bit old style as opposed to modern. They had a complimentary computer room and a very helpful concierge and staff. The only negative is that the breakfast was a total ripoff (20 Euros for some croissants  juice). We ate at Acqua al 2 (a restauarant on Acqua street - +39 55 28 4170 make reservations  try the tasting menus) which was one of the best restaurants I ate at in Italy (also try Il cantinone in Florence). Back to the hotel. It's in a great location in a great city. The rooms are very nice  it was a very nice place to stay.

<Content>Great location! We don't usually stay at American chains overseas, but my Starpoints got the family(Mom, Dad and 17  20 year old sons) in here free. So, it was a no-brainer. Location is a couple blocks from the city center, maybe a 10 minute walk, not bad. It's right on the river, walk out the hotel across the street to the views. Rooms are nice, not huge, but for Europe very adequate. Staff was very attentive and curteous, especially the concierge desk. They had all the answers and recommendations for us regarding Florence and surrounding areas. I even contacted them in advance of our trip to obtain timed tickets to the Academie, Pitti, Boboli and Uffizi so we would not ahve to wait in line. Not only did they do this, but did so without charging me until I arrived. Only drawback was the cost of their restaurant. Unlike most European hotels where breakfast is included, it is not here. A bowl of cereal or a single pancake or a single slice of french toast was 7 Euros, nearly $10! Since we got the rooms free, I could not complain too loudly, but there is no reason to gouge the guests. There are a couple of wonderful little bakeries just up the road toward the train station, and for about 10 Euros, all 4 of us ate yummy croissants and cakes with juice. Ask the concierge, he'll direct you there. Ponte Vecchio is 10 minutes, Train Station, 10 minutes, Central Market(highly recommended) 15 minutes, Uffizi 15 minutes, tons of restaurants within 5-10 minutes.

<Content>Exceptional service!! We are currently staying at the Westin Excelsior in Florence in the middle of a three week holiday in Italy. The hotel is beautiful from the lobby to the room. Our room is one of the more standard rooms (I believe) but it is a very nice size with entry foyer for storage of luggage separate from the bedroom and nice size bathroom (room 150). Room is decorated in a style very appropriate for Florence, tasteful elegance. The staff are amazing, everyone gracious and professional. The concierge staff are amazing with their advice and cheerful attitude. We would definitely choose this hotel again!!!

<Content>Don't settle for less that you deserve The positive:This Westin really feels like a Westin. The hallways are large and the entryway is grand. The decorations are beautiful, and the staff professional.The negative:Several months ago, we reserved two rooms (we had the kids), and they were supposed to be adjoining. When we discovered that the rooms were on two separate hallways on the same floor, we contacted the front desk. We were told that the rooms were actually very close to each other, and that those rooms were the only two available. (the rooms were not in sight of each other) After I said that I was still uncomfortable with the distance, another room was found a few doors away from the first. The solution was acceptable, but I felt that I had to be aggressive, and that bothered me. It makes me wonder why the second room wasn't offered immediately. We didn't ask for upgrades or anything out of the ordinary. The hotel rep was pleasant, and so was I, yet it leaves me feeling a little uncomfortable.That being said, the location is excellent, and we loved Florence.

<Content>Decent centrally located hotel My wife and I spent the last three nights of our honeymoon at the Excelsior and found the hotel to be very agreeable. Obviously being a large hotel owned by a company like westin, you will not find so many personalised touches like you would in a top end independent establishment, but it did the job. Check in/out was efficient and the concierge was helpful (they organised guided visits of the Uffizi and Accademia galleries which are highly recommended). Views from the room over the Arno were very good too.Your are spoiled for choice for eating out in Florence, but be aware that during August a lot of places close for summer vacation. We stayed in Florence 6 years ago and decided to revisit the places we went to last time. The only one worth returning to was Da il Latini. Yes it can be touristy, but the visitors and locals go there in equal measure. The food is good and reasonably priced and the atmospher always lively.Just 2 complaints that keep the Westin from getting 5 stars:1) the decor in the room is a little dated and is in need of a refurb.2) the night before we arrived, there was heavy rain. We found that the french windows to the balcony had leaked leaving the carpet smelling slightly damp. We complained, but were not offered a room change or compensation. Slightly disappointed.(For comparison we also stayed at the Palazzo Sasso in Ravello and the Relais La Suvera nr Siena - reviews on TA).

<Content>Loved the Excelsior We booked the Excelsior through our travel agent, but when we arrived at the front desk after an all-night flight, we found out that the travel agent had booked the rooms for August instead of June. Even though the hotel was full, the front desk staff bent over backwards to help us out of our predicament. They were able to find us two rooms for the first two nights and promised to find us something comparable for our third night. While we waited for the rooms to be cleaned, they treated us to complimentary beverages at the bar and sent our bags up while we finished our drinks. Although we didn't get rooms with river views (as our travel agent had booked), the rooms we did get were spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated. I'm a big fan of Westin's heavenly beds and they did not disappoint, especially the first night after flying. By staying at the Excelsior, we got the best of both worlds--European charm and American amenities (large bathrooms with showers, etc.). The concierge staff was excellent and helped us get dinner reservations and tickets to the museums. Breakfast was included with our room and we enjoyed the wide variety of foods available. We would definitely recommend the Excelsior!

<Content>Wonderful hotel Westin Excelsior is wonderful traditional luxury hotel, only minutes from Ponte Vecchio, Duomo and beautiful shopping street Via de Tornabuoni. Rooms are big and beautiful, with all the amenities you can expect from 5 star property. Breakfast was excellent also.The best part of this hotel was their concierge. They were most helpful! Our airline lost our bags, so they called several times to the airport and when luggage finally arrived, the sent a car to pick it up. They also have shuttle bus to the outlet village called The Mall (shuttle twice a day, 25 eur pp), what was quite a relief to us, as our luggage was lost for 3 days and we got all the new stuff from there :) (Some samples of prices - Gucci bags starts from 200 eur, Yves Saint Laurent bags 150 eur, Tod`s shoes 130 eur and etc). Concierge also arranged us Uffizi reservation.I would definately stay in this wonderful hotel again!

<Content>Family in Florence When our family of five (kids aged 8, 13, 16) I decided to visit Florence for a couple of days in March, I wanted to stay at a top hotel in an excellent location. After hours of research I chose the Westin Excelsior due to excellent reviews and a reasonable (everything's relative) price for a luxury hotel. We were not disappointed.Upon arriving at the hotel much erlier than the check-in time we were greeted warmly at the Reception Desk and shown to two beautiful connecting rooms overlooking the Arno River, complete with balconies. These rooms had been upgraded for free and were so nice no-one wanted to leave them right away to see the sights of Florence.The rooms and bathrooms were the largest we have seen in Italy and they were beautifully furnished and maintained. The public spaces of the hotel are also attractive, although theyshould turn down the volume on the music in the lobby.The Hotel's restaurant overcharged our bill for breakfast one morning and room service was only average for breakfast the other morning - definitely room for improvement. The Front Desk also put a charge on our bill for Copy Services of over $100 that was a mistake. They took my word that it was incorrect and removed it promptly, but it was clearly a sloppy mistake.There are groups that stay at the Hotel which adds a bit to noise and commotion, but that is to be expected for large hotels such as this one.The location was very good - it was an easy stroll to the center of Florence and it was nice to be close to a bridge to the other side of the Arno which has some nice family (non-touristy) restaurants. The Concierge Desk was extremely helpful arranging train tickets back to Rome and recommending and reserving dinner locations. There English was good and they were very polite.If your family wants a quiet intimate hotel in Florence this is probably not your choice. If you want a beautiful big hotel with some great rooms, this could be the spot.

<Content>A fine stay Our large family spent four nights here in two rooms. The rooms contained two twin beds pushed together to make a king and were large enough for a rollaway bed, too. The beds all were dressed in the Westin Heavenly Bed manner. The bathrooms were large enough, the water pressure and temperature fine by European standards. The rooms had fine views over the Arno. The windows kept the street noise out satisfactorily. On Saturday night, though, the hotel noise did creep into the room.The concierge staff was ample around the clock and very helpful to us. They communicated by email with us daily before our arrival and made reservations for cars, restaurants and museums for us before we arrived and I strongly recommend contacting them in advance of a stay.The restaurant serves American breakfast but at a very expensive price and I would look for substitutes. At dinner, the food is OK but not on a par with the hotel's 5-star rating and the wine list was poor - a few generic selections and some very expensive local selections, many listed without vintage.The hotel is a few minutes walk from everything a tourist would want to see, good restaurants and gelateria within a few blocks or across the first bridge one comes to and a number of galleries and shops immediately around the hotel.

<Content>Enjoyable Stay The Westin Excelsior is a beautiful old hotel located just outside the center of Florence. The marble lobby is impressive, but dark. The staff were polite and helpful (the concierge booked our museum tickets before our arrival), and the concierge desk was well-staffed.Our room was very pretty, but it needed to be updated. The room was very small, and It felt slightly worn and dark. However, the furnishings were beautiful, and the bed was really comfy. We may have received a better room had we not been using Starwood points to pay for it.Our breakfast was overpriced and not very good (the bread tasted stale). You are much better off eating breakfast outside of the hotel -- there are lots of options nearby.Overall, the hotel is probably the best in Florence, however, it could be even better. Nevertheless, we would stay at the Westin Excelsior again.

<Content>The Place To Stay In Florence....... From Bali to Rome, Thailand to Sorrento - this is the best hotel we have stayed in. An atmospheric bar area with entertainment most evenings made for a relaxing end to a day of sightseeing. Breakfast set us up for the day, with a wide choice of foods from full english to a range of Italian specialities. The staff were excellent, and room cleanliness second to none, with traditional Flortentine decor and glorious river views who could ask for more. The hotels decor is traditional in style and takes you into a a bygone era of indulgence and extravagance on the doorstep of the fabulous city of Florence. Our personal thanks go to the reservations manager Luigi who organised our booking.CHRIS  CAROLYN

<Content>We Felt Lonely We just came back from a weekend in Florence.The Westin staff were all very friendly. Luckily we got upraded to a suite because I don't think they could have fit the extra bed for our daughter in a regular room.It's a beautiful hotel but we felt quite lonely as there were not many other guests and eventhough the location near the river is lovely it is a little off the spot.We are thinking to try the Savoy Hotel or the Bernini Palace hotel for our next trip.

<Content>Good, not great This is a grand old hotel. The rooms are large, bathrooms are modern but the communal area's are dated and staid. The staff uniforms are dated. The whole places lacks something ...those little touches that take an hotel from 4 stars to 5. Simply not chicc or polished. We (7 family members) stayed for 6 nights in a large suite with 2 additional rooms interleading rooms with views over the Arno. Found hotel to be just outside of where its all happening ...only a 5 minute walk away.

<Content>Splendid Experience! Itéˆ¥æªš really hard to put into words the experience this hotel offers. Situated on the banks of the Arno River and a ten minute walk from the train station, this hotel has it all. We greeted warmly by hotel staff and were given a lovely interior room with a very large bathroom. The room had two large French doors that opened into an interior courtyard which made the room bright and airy. Since the hotel bar was under renovation, we were not able to take full advantage of all the hotel amenities. There was a temporary bar setup in a room off the main lobby. There was nothing really special about it, not even the cheesy music the piano player played each night could help. Rest assured that the new bar will be amazing. If you have the money, this hotel is well worth the splurge!!

<Content>Excellent Excelsior! Just returned from three nights in this hotel and wish we had stayed a couple more! We used Starwood points and also used a Starwood AmEx, so they gave us an upgrade. Our friends used more points to get a very nice room overlooking the Arno (per TravelLeisure's advice), but our room was twice as large, overlooking the beautiful courtyard garden (through stained glass windows!) with a king-sized four poster, painted ceilings, and cavernous inlaid marble bath--we felt like Medicis! The staff was charming and efficient. If you rang for room service or housekeeping, they were there in minutes, literally. The location can't be beat, at the foot of the shopping district, merely a few blocks from everything you'd want to see. We'll definitely be back and stay longer next time!

<Content>Excellent hotel The hotel is in a very good location, close to centre (5 minutes by foot) but not in the noisy centre of Florence, and with a wonderful view. The room, we had, was spacious and with a beatiful view. Finally, the service was very good.

<Content>Haven of Luxury and attentive service In travelling for 2 weeks through Italy with my 25 year old son, this was always going to be a highlight, not only because we were in Flornce, but because this was going to be our one luxury hotel for the trip!We were not disappointed. Reception was professional, accomodating and welcoming. We were upgraded to a bigger room - always a nice touch in Italy! - the facilities were great, and the room large, well furnished and supremely comfortable. The bathroom was modern and functional.We ate breakfast in the hotel - good choice of food, unrushed and with good service, albeit expensive! We got laundry done - I think I could have replaced most of my travelling wardrobe for what that cost us....but, hey, we were in Florence, in a fantstic location close to everything, we had peace and quiet when we wanted it, and could walk anywhere we wanted to go. We also got a late checkout so we had somewhere to wait for our afternoon train.We both really enjoyed this stay and would certainly return.

<Content>It was just fine The exterior of the hotel was a little disappointing for what was billed as a 5-star, but the lobby and bar area were pretty nice. The room had a very nice bathroom with two sinks and was pretty spacious for Europe. All in all, I'd give it a solid 4 stars.

<Content>Great Hotel, Highly Recommend This is a beautiful hotel. My parents had a corner room on the 4th floor that was just slightly larger than my room. Their room had a balcony that overlooked the Arno and gave us many beautiful views of the Ponte Vecchio reflecting on the Arno. My room was also on the 4th floor but overlooked the Piazza and gave me a beautiful view of the city and the Arno. The staff was very friendly and attentive. It was close to so many restaurants and sights. Our only complaint was that the piano in the bar was too close to the lobby and, therefore, too loud to enjoy.

<Content>Loved It! We arrived in Florence via train from Rome. They told us the room wasn't quite ready, to give them about 45 minutes and then come back, so we went to a little cafe around the corner and had a snack. When we got back in about 1 hr., the room was ready and they took us up to it. Well, much to our surprise, they had upgraded us to a suite that was out of this world. I think because I was a starwood preferred member, not sure why we got upgraded. Anyway, the room was fantastic, with nice black-out shades, and a view of the city. The bed was in keeping with Westin's Heavenly Bed, which I love. The bathroom had robes, slippers and really nice bath products. The staff there was, by far, the best and most acomodating that we found on our entire trip to Italy. They helped us rent a car for the day, got us tickets to the Ufuzzi/Galleria and were always very friendly. There was a breakfast buffet each morning, which we didn't get because it was really expensive, but in the dining room they had american coffee in a pot with styrofoam cups sitting next to it so you could actually get a cup of coffee to go! Either my husband or myself would go each morning and get coffees and bring them back to the room. We did order breakfast off the menu there, but even that was expensive. The restaurant serves dinner, but we never ate there because there are so many restaurants in town that we wanted to try. The hotel itself is about 2 blocks from Ponte Vecchio, Ufuzzi and other major spots. We walked everywhere and really enjoyed the location. After a long day, we would come back to our suite, have some wine, cheese and whatever else to snack on and just enjoy the room and the view. I would go back in a minute and recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Very, very nice! I can't add much to what the reviewer from St. Paul wrote. It is a magnificent hotel with a gorgeous lobby, gorgeous rooms, huge, fantastic bathrooms, and very helpful and gracious staff. And ..the Heavenly Bed, which IS as good as is touted to be.It is indeed pricey, but we had a 3-for-2 rate from the Starwood website (prepaid), which amounted to about 1100 Euros for 3 nights. I didn't expect much as an SPG Gold, but we were upgraded to a very large room facing the Arno. While the view was sensational, you will hear some street noise from the rooms facing the Arno.The restaurant and bar prices are astronomical, as stated in other reviews here. True in most grand hotels, but there is no shortage of restaurants/cafes/bars in Florence. We have stayed at *wood properties in many of the European capitals, and this is among the best. We will definitely return.

<Content>Splendid Luxury My wife and I recently stayed in the Westin Excelsior for three nights at the end of August this year. The entire stay was wonderful. The staff members are extremely friendly, courteous, efficient, and very fluent in English. The concierge desk could not have been more accomodating, even when we needed use of an adaptor for our computer at midnight one night. The location next to the river could not have been better. It is less than a twenty minute walk to a number of sites, including the train station, Piazza Santa Maria Novella, Ponte Vecchio, and the Uffizi Gallery. There are also a number of fabulous nearby restaurants and a wine bar just around the corner that comes alive each night at 10:00 p.m. The rooms are plush with old world furniture, window treatments, and artwork. The bathroom was roomy and up to date. There was also a work desk to conduct a little business each day, and hi-speed internet access for a fee. This is a great place to stay if price is of little concern and you want a pampered experience from beginning to end. We would not hesitate to stay again if we are ever in the Tuscany area in the future.

<Content>prefer the Rome Westin location Just returned from a five night stay in Florence and Rome, at the Westin Excelssior in each city. The stay in Rome was fantastic. The stay in Florence was far less enjoyable. I realize that Florence does not have a lot of hotel options, but the room size (for a premium deluxe) was quite small. The room we were given (as starwood gold members) had a courtyard view - which was very unattractive. The front desk clerks were, at best, argumentative when we complained about the room we were given. Do not eat breakfast in the hotel - it's about $50 per person for the small buffet (you can have a full American breakfast in the beautiful cafe's nearby for $15 eu.

<Content>Great hotel in Florence Spent 3 nights at the Westin in Florence, and we loved our room (room 564) éˆ¥?which was different than most of the pictures. Looks like it was converted attic space. It was more modern too, had a great huge marble bathroom and even though at check-in they said this room had no view, it did indeed have a nice view of the Duomo although you had to climb five steps to the window --- it was an unusual room like I said. The Westin as always was comfortable, and this Westin was much nicer and better kept than the one in Rome. The location is a few blocks away from the main area of town, so be ready to walk a bit to the main sights. The room was expensive (just under 500 Euro per night) and the food in the hotel was expensive, although you could do well at breakfast ordering a-la-carte rather than the expensive buffet.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Just returned from 3 nights in Florence at the Westin Excelsior. My room was huge. The king bed was lost in the big room that was very nicely decorated. I loved it. Hotel was beautiful overall, service very good. It is expensive but the terrific hotel added to the pleasure of being in Florence.

<Content>An extremely nice hotel, but not for the budget minded Extraordinarily lovely building, very very attentive service, and a great location overlooking the Arno. Our room was extremely comfortable and well furnished. It's just a short walk to everything, but it's a bit removed from most of the noise and congestion of the touristy areas. Highly recommended. Just don't eat breakfast here, which is very very overpriced.

<Content>World class service You get what you pay for, at least in this case. World class service (made me forget i was in Italy :-) ). Great location and a very comfortable room (and then some). Unfortunatley we only stayed at this hotel one night. If you can afford it, there is no better choice in Florence.

<Content>5 Star Service - Great Location! We really enjoyed our stay at the Westin Excelsior. This was our first trip to Italy and we spent the first two weeks in a villa we rented in Tuscany. In planning our trip, we decided to stay in a hotel in Florence at the end of our trip to avoid having to make day trips into the city to see the museums and architecture. We chose the Excelsior because of the positive comments on TripAdvisor and its location within walking distance of all the places we wanted to visit in the city. It was a great experience staying there. Every person on the hotel staff we came into contact with was very professional. No exceptions. Our first encounter was with the hotel concierge who I had emailed from the States to ask if he/she could arrange tickets for us at certain museums so we would not have to stand in the long ticket lines when we got there. Within 2 days, I received a very professionally written email with our ticket reservation dates, times, and confirmation numbers. Consequently, when we got to Florence, we just bypassed the lines and were inside the museums right away. We arrived at the hotel on a Saturday afternoon and the room we had rented was ready and just as advertised,. However, the high speed internet connection to our room was down and could not be fixed until Monday because the company that provided the service was not open on the weekends (Italy, you know). The hotel manager sent us a great box of Godiva chocolates to apologize. The internet issue was the only problem we encountered and the hotel handled it very well. Plus we really didn't need it anyway and if we did, there was wireless high speed in the lobby and a business center with high speed. The hotel is right on the Arno River and is within walking distance of the Ponte Vecchio, Uffizi, Academia, Medici Chapels, and all the other great Florence historical sites. The concierge also made dinner reservations for us at San Michele in Fiesole on their terrace and the view overlooking Florence was amazing. The beds in the hotel were classic Heavenly Bed style for Westin and we had no complaints of any type. I highly recommend this hotel. Grazie mille, Excelsior!

<Content>Outstanding location Just got back from a week in Florence (Firenza), staying at Westin Excelsior, with my wife on a vacation. First of all, let me say that this is probably the BEST location in Florence, with the best views, right on the Arno river. We looked around alot for other hotels we might want to stay at for our next visit and came to the conclusion that this is the best place in town (our guides told us the same thing) Across the square is the sister hotel, the Grand Hotel, which is equally as nice. You can walk to virtually everything within 10-15 minutes, straight down the sidewalk by the river Arno. It is worth the money to get a room with a view of the Arno, and balcony (they are really tiny balconies, but at least you can open the doors and gaze out). If you stay at an in town hotel, be prepared for alot of noise on the streets.Rooms are small, but nicely decorated, and our bathroom was actually bigger than many American hotels, with double sinks, separate toilet area and excellent shower/tub-great shower water pressure! I might advise to avoid stepping up to the suites, since they are really not much larger than a regular river view room (the pictures are misleading). English television selections are BBC and CNBC or else movies, but you probably won't watch TV anyway. The hotel employees are really, really helpful, and very nice and speak English quite well, so that is not a problem. The prices of food and drinks are quite high, but there is never a need to eat at the hotel, because Florence has so many excellent Trattorias, Cafes and Restaurants, all within a couple of minutes of the hotel, that are 1/2 or even 1/3 the price.Our room was around $500 Euro per night and I think we would pay that again and stay here if we go back. Walking guides of the Duomo and Ufizzi are avaliable thru the concierge, and they can get you into these places without lines, but they are quite expensive if booked thru the condierge--$80 Euro per hour, plus the cost of the entry to the museums. A guide is worth it, but maybe they can be found at half the price by not going thru your concierge.

<Content>Fell in love with Florence My husband and I spent 5 of our 10 days in Italy at the Westin Florence. It was by far the most enjoyable and memorable stay. We were upgraded to a Junor Suite, where a bottle of champagne and an absolutely amazing view of the river awaited us. We found little lacking with the service. We didnt see much of anyone, save the concierge who 90% of the time was a lifesaver. He arranged a private car and driver for a drive through the Chianti region that included a private tour of a small local winery. Ironically, all the concierge staff we encountered were named like the Teenage Mutant Ninja turtles. The one without such a name was the only one to steer us wrong. On our last night, we wanted to have dinner in a high class, 5 star restaurant. He seemed incapable of naming such a place. So, tired and worn out, we gave in and followed his recommendation. Not surprisingly, we saw many other patrons of our hotel at dinner that evening and again at breakfast the next morning. The staircase was breathtaking, the food at Ristorante il costello was amazing, the live music in the bar could have been better but....it was our honeymoon so we enjoyed it all.

<Content>Fantastic Experience at Westin Excelsior Florence I'm shocked to hear the previous reviewer's awful experience at the Westin Excelsior Florence. We stayed there for 5 nights from April 2nd-6th and had a wonderful time. Our room was beautiful and the concierges were nothing but polite and helpful. Though we enjoy fine dining and hotels, we are very laidback, unpretentious travelers who enjoy eating at cheap trattorias as much as michelin star restaurants. When we needed directions to my boyfriend's favorite pizzeria from a previous visit to Rome years ago, the concierge immediately knew where it was and marked a route on the map. I found the service to be very unpretentious and helpful for all of my needs. We forgot our American power converter, and service express delivered one to our room within minutes. When we asked the concierge to schedule a last minute reservation at the Uffizi, he did so without hesitation. Every need we had was readily and politely met. Our standard room was spacious, and had a nice view of the piazza in front of the hotel and a partial view of the Arno. The antique furnishings are gorgeous!I'm unaware of the hotel's relationship with CAF Tours, as we did not arrange any guided tours. But I would stay at the Westin Excelsior again without hesitation, and I would recommend it to any of my friends and family. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there.

<Content>Don't Believe The Hype! Beware! Major Issues With Stay March '06, MUST READ My newlywed wife and I just arrived back to San Diego, California after traveling around Italy for several weeks for our Honeymoon. We confided heavily on trip advisor to help us with our hotel plans and were very satisfied, except for our stay at the Westin Excelsior located in Florence. Anyone traveling to Florence and planning to stay here please beware! My wife was treated so rudely by the concierge our first few hours at this hotel, she came to me crying. Later that evening a hotel guest from New York who had overheard the hotels rude manners towards my wife, came up to us and let us know that the issue was not us and that they too had experienced similar mistreatment by the hotel. All of us agreed that this is not something that should ever occur at any hotel, especially not a hotel that is supposed to be of this caliber. They have a high ranking on this site and on their website advertise that they are considered to be one of the top 75 hotels in Europe. Can you belive that the situation only got worse. During our preplanning of our trip to the Tuscany region, the hotel had referred us to a tour company called CAF Tours. Turns out that the Excelsior and their sister hotel across the street the Grand have contracts with CAF Tours. They will not recommend anyone else, even after CAF cancelled their tours. Several tour companys are located less than 100 meters away. After confronting them with their existance they let us know that they new of the other companies but are bound by a contract with CAF tours. CAF tour company cancelled all of our excursions around Florence. Even after cancelling the hotel concierge had no further recomendations to help us salvage our trip. In fact when it came to resturaunt recomendations if it wasn't $100+ per person they never had heard of it and could not tell us how to get there. We are not cheap, we just don't eat 5 star everynight for every meal. We were scheduled to spend 6 nights in Florence. In fact our treatment by the hotel staff who lied to us on more than one occasion in addition to treating us and others rudely was so bad that we checked out after one night and changed to another hotel with views of the river. The Excelsior Hotel in Florence is beautiful, the rooms are big, but if you are looking for a true five star, the service here is not even a 3 star. I do not wish the nightmare that this hotel created for us on anyone else. Good luck in your travels. For tour companys in Italy stay away from CAF Tours and anything from City-Discovery they both cancelled all of our tours. There is a great company in Florence Artviva who works with Florence Walking Tours (excellent), in Rome we really enjoyed services from (Vatican Tours).

<Content>Best in Florence In August of last year we stayed in the Westin Excelsior Florence. We reserved a Junior Suite and as a Starwood Platinum member they upgraded us to a the palatial and absolutely stunning Presidential Suite with a bottle of champagne and a welcome note from the GM waiting for us.The suite featured a large wrap around terrace with great views of the Arno River. Simply stunning suite with great furniture and beautifully decorated.The service was outstanding across the board. Room service was a bit mediocre and was overpriced but I find this to be true of most grand dame hotels in Europe.The morning buffet breakfast was ample and delicious. The dining room is beautiful and the food was exceptional.This is a great hotel with a terrific staff. We did not see the other categories of rooms so can not comment. As with all Starwood properties in Europe I would recommend booking a higher category room and requesting an upgrade upon check-in. They treat their Platinum SPG members well.

<Content>One of the best hotel experiences we have had Excellent in all ways, service and organisation was superb and all staff were so friendly and attentive. We stayed in a deluxe room on the fourth floor with a magnificent river view. The room had a luxurious bathroom and the bed was so comfy we didnt want get out of it. The breakfasts were superb, the public areas and restaurants luxurious. Location is wonderful.

<Content>Service above any other place I have stayed. From the moment I went in, I found that all of the hotel staff were very friendly and were always interested in how my stay was going. The room was very well-appointed and big with beautiful marble bathroom.Food from room service was very good and also the location was great. There was nothing to dislike about this place.

<Content>Supremely elegant, yet comfortable. This is just a beautiful hotel in a beautiful city. Spectacularly decorated, lots of beautiful marble and fabrics, but never looking chintzy. Lobby is fantastic, rooms were beautifully decorated with a lovely chandelier , a bed to die for, and with windows on two walls. The bathroom had a walkthrough to a balcony outside as well.Concierge and reception were immaculate, although there was no-one outside to help with baggage when we arrived. The bar is comfortable, but definitely 'no scene'. Go outside if you want to have fun. Fully recommend this place.

<Content>Magical stay My wife and I stayed for two nights in January and had an awesome experience. We were lucky to get an upgrade to a suite overlooking the Arno River - a benefit of being a Platinum member with Starwood and traveling in early January. The location of the hotel on the Arno River was perfect straddling the north side of the Arno with the bulk of the tourist activities and the less-touristy south side with one of the best dining experiences we've had in our lives. The Santo Bevitore on Via di Santo Spirito is a don't miss dining experience - try the beef carpacio. We had a huge meal with a bottle of wine and walked out the door for about 55 Euro - an awesome price for such a good meal.All in all, the Westin Excelsior exceeded our expectations even after reading all of the glowing reviews from other reviewers. If you've got Starwood points and find yourself in Florence do yourself a favor and book this hotel.

<Content>Solid - but not 5 star My wife and I enjoyed a 3 night stay in late December at the Westin. Like other loyal Starwood members, I was looking to frequent a Starwood property while in Italy. I did Rome and Florence and the top 2 properties seemed to be the Westin (Florence) and St. Regis (Rome). Both are nice but are not comparable. This site seems to indicate similar rankings/accommodations/etc. The St. Regis is at least 2 classes ahead of the Westin. And while this is a solid hotel- good rooms, nice bath, it is not exceptional (generic Westin bath products, slightly above average linens/robes, decent furnishings).The concierges at both properties were exquisite.

<Content>Exactly what we pictured Florence would be! What a beautifully appointed hotel; really a classic! We had an adjoining suite which was absolutely phenomenal, overlooking the Arno. The staff was perfect, the service topnotch, and the rooms were unbelievable. The one thing we regret - not getting a picture of all of us on the staircase; if you go, make sure to bring a camera!

<Content>Classic Hotel Situated on the bank of the Arno River and within easy strolling distance of the city centre. The Ponte Vecchio Bridge is about half mile along the river bank from the hotel.Impressive lobby area with lots of marble and period furniture. Concierge desk very helpful on anything you want to see and gives good supply of maps for free. Reception staff are also very helpful.Bedrooms have high ceilings and match the dèŒ…cor of the hotel lobby. Beds are very comfortable and have super soft pillows. Bathrooms are all marble with frosted glass door separating the toilet from the rest of the bathroom. Air conditioning is efficient in cooling the room (We went May 2005). Notice on window warning of opening of windows because of mosquitoes and midges. My wife was bitten.The Donatello bar has a full range of drinks and draught beers. Drinks are expensive but you get a full range of nuts and crisps plus small pizza squares in the evening. IL Cesptello restaurant is expensive but the food is very good. Wine list expensive but you can get wine of the region at 26 Euro per bottle and also wine by the glass.Lots of small restaurants nearby and cafèŒ…/bars serving sandwiches and pizza. Prices here are cheaper and you can sit outside on the pavement tables but watch the mozzies.

<Content>What a wonderul place! We booked our room using Starwood points. Upon arrival, we were informed that we had been upgraded to a penthouse room (ok, it was a top floor room, but penthouse sounds so exclusive!). We had a full patio, which saw little use as it rained the entire time we were there, but the room was spacious and very comfortable. The Heavenly Beds are different from those in the US - not quite as plush - but are still wonderful to sink into after a long day of sightseeing, shopping and eating.The service was just about perfect - the concierges were able to get us dinner reservations, tickets to the Uffizi Gallery and advise us about the best things to spend the day doing. Service in the cocktail lounge was warm and friendly.We peeked into the Grand, a sister hotel just across Piazza Ognissanti, and it looked similarly splendid. I'm sure you couldn't go wrong there, but the Excelsior is a very special place indeed.I can't wait to go back!

<Content>Great Hotel. Are heavenly beds the same? Beautiful hotel, great location. All reviews are correct. Stayed with starwood points for 2 nights, and was given an upgrade the second night. The first night the room was very small, but the second night I was upgraded to a bigger room with a balcony and a view to the Arno river. Very spacious. A personal comment: The heavenly beds in this hotel and in the Westin Excelsior in Rome (stayed there after Florence), are not that heavenly. I have stayed in many Westins before in the US, and these beds are simply not the same. The matress seems very hard, the sheets and pillows are not the same tha i other westins. I did not have that feelint to not want to leave the bed. Again, this is a personal comment and I might be wrong. I asked the front desk if somebody else had the same comment and she told me that the some people have commented on the same, but she assured me that the beds were heavenly beds built in Europe under the Westin standard. It did not feel the same.Tips in Florence:The restaurants across the river are less touristy. Went to an excellent one, great prices and superb food: forgot the name but I think was named Pandemonium

<Content>Far exceeded all our expectations!!  My husband and I (ages 33/29) just returned from our first trip to Italy. We are blessed to travel extensively for pleasure (no kids yet) and try to stay in the best 4.5 and 5 star hotels. I can honestly say this is now, MY FAVOURITE HOTEL in the world, along with the Beverly Hills Hotel. After extensive research I booked this hotel due to: old world charm/luxury, view over Arno, accessibility, and service. Also, due to great experiences in the past at other Starwood properties. We stayed 4 nights and found it easy to do day trips to Pisa and Tuscany, as well as walking to all the main sites in Florence. We had booked a Premium Deluxe w/arno view and balcony - 6 months in advance (special discounted price of 540E/night, included tax and daily buffet brk.) and had requested to be on a high floor (corresponded by e-mail directly with hotel reservations supervisor). We were kindly upgraded to a MAGNIFICENT junior suite on the 4th floor w/arno view and 2 balconies due to our Starwood loyalty. I cannot say enough about all the wonderful aspects of this hotel. The decor in the public areas and room are INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL, along with service in all areas that rivals any Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, etc. Despite it's size of 5 floors/161 rooms - it felt like a boutique hotel. We rarely saw many people at any given time (despite it being high season) and service was extremely individualized! The hotel actually was fairly full to capacity we found out but you would have never known. It was so incredibly peaceful, serence, and elegant. And despite it's amazing opulence, we felt very compfortable being a young couple staying there and being casually dressed daily (nice shorts/skirts). We were actually treated like royalty as was everyone else we saw was also being treated. This trip was not to celebrate anything imparticular but just a dream come true to finally visit Italy and this dreamlike hotel. I can't imagine they would treat anyone differently then they did us or how anyone could be dissappointed (if booking a high floor room/with view). Due to curiosity, we went inside the Grand Hotel across the square which was also elegant but in a more modern way in some areas. I'm glad we picked the Excelsior due to the more old world charm'' setting and beautiful Florentine style rooms of rose/cream decor. Our room even had electrically controlled black out shades on the outside of all our windows, though the room was still fairly quiet when we had the blinds up and doors open during the early morning and late evenings to enjoy the amazing views. Overall, this hotel was worth every penny and I would not hesitate highly recommending it to anyone. We actually never wanted to leave and will definately only stay at this hotel upon our future visits to Florence. I would give this hotel 6 STARS if I could!! Feel free to e-mail me about any further details of this hotel or Florence in general - wonderful city/area region!!

<Content>Wonderful We loved this hotel. We were only there a few nights but the room was beautiful. Not only was the bed supremely comfortable but the bathroom was huge and very nicely done. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The concierge was very helpful obtaining reservations for dinner. This is one of our favorite hotels anywhere in the world.

<Content>A Wonderful and Memorable Stay My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at the Westin Excelsior Florence and I can't say enough wonderful things about our stay there. We were given complimentary champagne and fruit upon our arrival which was great. We also received a beautiful (and spacious) corner room overlooking the square and a view of the Arno. The bathroom was large as well, with separate tub and shower and double sinks. We didn't have a problem with turndown service - received Godiva chocolates nightly. The service was excellent, especially with the concierge. I would stay in this hotel again without hesitation - I look forward to returning soon!

<Content>Loved the Excelsior This was a welcome break in our European travels. The staff was very helpful. The concierges were great. One day we wanted to just ride around and take an overview and asked the concierge for taxi driver who knew the city and spoke English. He called in a guy - Johnny - that was a multi-generation Florencian who became a great friend. Cost almost nothing compared to a guide.We enjoyed some of the American touches and they had the best beds in Europe including the other great 5 star hotels we stayed at.

<Content>Overpriced There was nothing actually wrong with this hotel as such, it just was not as good as I expected.I paid extra for a river view and a large marble bathroom, well if that was large I would hate to be stuck with the standard sized!!!!The river view was disappointing as the room we were given was on the first floor, there wasn't much of a view.We didn't try the hotel restaurant as both nights that we were there it was completely empty.The service in the bar was very slow and the food/drinks, v expensive.In summary, I would have been satisfied if I had paid 150 euro, but at 560 euro, I felt robbed.

<Content>Expected more I must admit that I expected more from this hotel, the hotel has wonderful furnishings and is in a beautiful square in a great location but unfortunately lacked that certain something. I think this hotel may be more suitable to families and an older generation. The reception staff were lovely but concierge were a bit abrupt.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Staff, Stay! My wife and I just returned from four days at the Westin as part of a two week trip through Italy. The hotel and rooms were lovely, clean, and very comfortable. All of the staff were very helpful and accommodating. Concierge staff was great. Food and drinks are expensive at the hotel, but no more so than any 4 or 5 star hotel here in the States or anywhere else for that matter. A great central location at the Piazza Ognissanti, perfect for exploring the city. Rarely took a taxi as a result. If you have the time, we also recommend getting out into Tuscany--spent a day touring the area with a private guide and it is truly beautiful. Planning our trip back already (for tour, try ------------). Would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Fabulous!!! My husband and I just stayed for three nights at the Westin in Florence, it was amazing! We loved it, the concierge and hotel staff are great. They were very helpful in making dinner and museum reservations for us. The restaurant and bar were somewhat pricey, but overall I don't think much more than any Westin anywhere else. (except the Danieli in Venice is about the MOST overpriced hotel for food/drinks I've ever experienced). We were on our honeymoon, and the hotel gave us a top floor room with a beautiful city view, we could see the Duomo while laying in bed!!! The terrace off our room was unbelievable, we had breakfast and dinner out there several times. Just had to take advantage of it!!! We stayed on Starwood points, so not sure if it is worth the Euros for you, but I swear you will not be disappointed. We loved it!!!

<Content>Great hotel and service My wife and I just returned from 6 days at the Westin. We upgraded to a room with a view of the Arno and Ponte Vecchio - expensive, but well worth it, as I spent hours watching the sun rise/set and the lights come up across the river; and you can't beat the Heavenly Bed. The hotel was very clean and beautifully furnished, and we're pretty picky. All of the staff was unbelievably helpful - especially the concierge staff, who always had recommendations for restaurants, events, directions, etc. In addition, the hotel is on the Piazza Ognissanti, across from a beautiful and important church that's worth the look. It is also a block from one of the downtown Avis rental car locations, which makes for easy exits from town into Tuscany. Try Trattoria Armando, a great little local place around the corner, for dinner! We can't wait to go back!

<Content>A fine stay at the Westin Excelsior We just returned from a 3 day stay at the Westin Excelsior. We enjoyed the hotel's lovely old world style on the River Arno. We received a Starwood upgrade to a room with a balcony overlooking the river. We had a panoramic view of the river that we thoroughly enjoyed.The bathrooms were plush and well appointed. The bed was extremely comfortable. The room was quiet when the exterior blinds were closed...made for a great night's sleep. We were welcomed with a chilled bottle of champagne. One night we received a whole box of Baci chocolates....much appreciated. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel....it was expensive and there were many fine restaurants in the area that we wanted to try instead.The concierge was helpful...had no problem with taxis...they called us metered ones...were not ripped off by the drivers. On the downside, the rooms have fabric wallpaper...they seemed to be a bit dusty. We will stay there again on our next visit to Florence.

<Content>Stay at this gem on the arno! Our family were fortunate to have found the historic and sophisticated Westin Excelsior and enjoyed our stay there immensely. Having heard of it's reputation first as the home of the Medici Family and then as hotel to literary, diplomatic and silver screen giants, we decided to give it a try and were glad that we did. Not the place for the bargain traveler, but for those with a taste for and the means to enjoy elegance and luxury, everything for us was just right. This hotel was the ideal base from which to explore the artistic wonders Florence and the surrounding Tuscan countryside. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable with wonderful beds and striking views of the Arno River and the Tuscan hillsides from our balconies. We had rooms on the fourth floor (#428 for my 17-year old neice who loved her room and #430 for us), above the noise of the frontage road that runs along the river and we do recommend that other travelers request rooms on the higher floors with river views. The service at the hotel was excellent and friendly. We were greeted with a lovely fruit basket on our arrival and the porter was quick to being us ice as requested (they understand how necessary it is for Americans to have lots of ice!). Restaurant recommendations were spot on and the inside tips from the friendly concierge was welcome and handy. The bar and restaurant are a bit dated, but the food and service was excellent and experiencing the old world charm was really fun - it added much to the charm of our stay and Florentine experience. Lots of Groups stay at this hotel and they have special events that locals frequent so it is a busy, vibrant place, but that's good because it only means that the hotel will be there when we return to our beautiful Florence!

<Content>somewhat overrated we had expected much more of this hotel given the hype around it. while it is well located within the city, the hotel is fairly old and out-moded. our room was relatively small and faced an interior courtyard with views of other rooms and not much light (and this was considered a Starwood preferred room). It was also very stuffy in the room and after trying valiantly to get some air moving, we were told that the central air system had not yet been turned on for the season. The only thing they could do for us was bring a fan to the room which helped a bit. The hotel restaurant was very expensive and the food fairly average. Overall - an ok experience but definitley not great...

<Content>Expected Better We just returned from Florence where my husband, myself and our young son stayed at the Westin Excelsior for two nights. On the positive side, the front desk and concierge were very gracious and helpful at all times. The rooms are large and clean and the bathroom was impressive. On the negative side, we found the breakast option to be quite poor for a five star hotel. First, it was outrageously expensive and the food options were quite limited. We ordered a la carte and was disappointed with the quality of the food. Second, when leaving the hotel to go to the train station we asked the hotel to hail us a taxi. Instead of calling a regular metered taxi, they put us into a private taxi that apparently did not have a meter. When we arrived at the train station which is literally a three to five minute ride from the hotel, we were told that we owed 27 euros for the ride. To put things into perspective, our train tickets from Florence to Siena (duration: 1.5 hours) cost us a third of the taxi ride. Third, we asked the hotel to arrange to have a baby sitter for our 15-month old son while we enjoyed a dinner in Florence. My husband and I have stayed at many fine hotels in Europe and used this service several times. While the babysitter was fine, again we found the hotel's attempt to charge excessive rates to be very disappointing. The hotel charged 20 euros per hour while other comparative hotels usually charge anywhere between 10-15 euros. Lastly, I was very disappointed when my earrings mysteriously disappeared from our room. We searched everywhere and could not find them in the place that I left them the night before. While I cannot direct blame to any individual, it certainly did not contribute to our experience at this hotel. In conclusion, the hotel's location and appearance is superb, but we were genuinely disappointed with the hotel's policy of offensive and excessive charges.

<Content>Excellent We just returned from a 10 night stay at this fabulous hotel. We stayed here with Starwood Points and we were given one of the largest rooms on the entire floor (saw the blueprint of the floor as we got off the elevator). We were right on the river and had a beautiful view all the way to the Ponte Vechio. We especially loved the sound of the church bells every morning. We had complimentary wine in our room upon arrival and about the 5th night, returned to our room to find a box of Godiva chocolates. Not to be confused with the Godiva chocolates that you will find on your pillow each night with turn down service! We also recieved a bottle of Italian Olive Oil on our last night!! Impeccable service from the front desk...everyone was so polite and gracious and gave us wonderful service. One of the most memorable hotel experiences we have ever had!!

<Content>Very Impressive  We walked to the hotel from the train station and the doorman literally ran into the street to help us with our bags. The room was surprisingly big (very high ceilings) and luxurious, overlooking the Arno River. The bathroom was very nice as well. The concierge could not have been more friendly and accomodating, made you feel very comfortable and welcome. The evening lounge included a wonderful piano player singing American songs...lots of fun. I would certainly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great stay in the best hotel in town! We had booked through the website of Westin and found a nice rate at this hotel (they say, you get the best rates guaranteed on their site). We arrived pretty late that January evening and there was slight rain. A porter came hasting towards our taxi to greet us with an umbrella and our luggage had already been brought into the lobby and then the room before we ourselves arrived there! Staff is so friendly! Having traveled a lot to other five star hotels, where you sometimes get a rather snobbish attitude, I must say that at the Westin Excelsior in Florence the experience was breathtaking. The concierge was very helpful and room service was fast and extraordinary friendly.The room we stayed in (unfortunately without a river view) was much larger than we had expected and had a beautiful terrace overlooking the city. They call these penthouse rooms and the rooms deserve their name. Overall the hotel is very luxurious and stands out very proudly on the banks of the Arno river. We had an unforgettable experience in a truely magnficent city!

<Content>FOR THE EUROS--WAY OVER-RATED We visited this hotel in late September on a business/vacation trip. I was to receive a fax from my office each day. It always arrived a day late. For the price of nearly $750/night I wouldn't recommend you spend the money. It is between two noisy streets.

<Content>Fantastic Stay This place was awesome. It is elegant in its decor but not stuffy. The staff was very helpful in all ways to include help with directions and suggestions for meals. The walk to the center of town is about 5-10 minutes. The beds are very typical Westin feather bed that let you sink into the bed. Make sure you take in a sunset along the river from your balcony. We have nothing bad to say about this place.

<Content>Tops in Tuscany (or anywhere else) In a city known for great art and architecture, the Excelsior fits right in. From the check in to our departure, we were pampered at every turn. Others on this site have praised the concierge service, and I have to agree. Massimo Parlantigot us in at Il Latini in the cantina downstairs, far from the crowd and noise upstairs. Six of us were treated to a multi-course Tuscan meal in the wine cellar, surrounded by what seemed to be a million Euros worth of Super Tuscans, first-growth Bordeaux, and magnums of Chateau d'Yquem. I don't know where he got the connection to pull that off, but if you want an excellent introduction to Tuscan cuisine, see if you can get your group in to the cantina at Il Latini.As a Starwood Platinum member we were upgraded to a penthouse suite overlooking the Arno, even though we were staying on points. There's nothing like sipping Chianti classico while watching the Tuscan sun set over the hills.Check it out!

<Content>Home from Home Having spent 15 years of traveling to Florence, primarily on business, it is always such a relief to arrive at the Excelsior Hotel to know that this is a home away from home. From the welcoming smile of the doorman, you know that you half won half the battle in finding somewhere in Florence that provides unrivalled 5 star service.There are many new boutique hotels in Florence now - i have tried these to, but who wants contemporary small rooms when in Italy? The Excelsior's rooms are however varied - i go for the penthouse suites on the top floor since most of these offer a terrace and some of these look directly onto the river ARNO where you can sit back and enjoy a glass of complimentary Vin Santo. These rooms have a lower ceiling height compared to the grander rooms on the lower floors - but the terrace makes up for the difference.Staff are always at your disposal, conceirge always provide the service you would expect from a 5 star hotel - the bar is great for a pre-dinner cocktail -to be enjoyed whilst the resident pianist plays in the early evening.Above all - this hotel - whilst big - feels homely and unique. Don't stay anywhere else - forget the SAVOY - its too noisy and the rooms are too small.SALUTE!

<Content>Sheer luxury and impeccable service Having stayed at dozens of fine Starwood hotels across the world, I have to say that the Westin Excelsior Florence should really be the gold standard that other hotels strive for. From the moment you arrive, the service is impeccable, the staff anticipates your needs and everyone seems generally happy to please you. The hotel itself is centrally located right on the Arno River. Most reviews would tell you to ask for a river view, which is beautiful. However, if you have the Starwood status to get upgraded, don't be afraid of the 5th floor on the city side. The first four floors on the city side look across the street to other buildings. The 5th floor rises above them all with a stunning view of central Florence, the Duomo, the cathedrals, the churches; it was literally breathtaking. However the 5th floor is mostly suites, so you'll probably need to be a Starwood platinum or pay for the upgrade to get it - it'd be worth the price! Heavenly baths and showers, attentive service, the best concierge staff I've ever experienced. Instead of pointing you to something in the hotel, they stop what they are doing and escort you there! When you tell them that's not necessary, they tell you it is their pleasure, and they sincerely mean it. Bring your own iron, no irons available here. And as with all Starwood Westins, the conditioner is watered down for some reason, bring your own. That's about the only negative I can think of. A short walk to the Duomo, the markets, the famous sights. Be sure to rent a car for the day and cruise the Chianti highway, Siena, etc. Great job Westin Florence!

<Content>La Dolce Vita at the Westin! From the moment you enter this hotel, you have entered in an old classic beauty- it has the cultural beauty of Tuscany, and yet it's very refined and polished. The concierge (Nico) is extremely friendly, and offers the best recommendations and service around! Our room (Room 150) was a standard room, but it was far from standard, it was quite a true delight! Very spacious room, HEAVENLY beds!, luxurious bathroom, and views of the river and piazza in front. The beds are so comfortable, you will NOT have a restless night here- and on top of that, they give you complimentary slippers (to keep) and robes. The hotel is in close proximity to everything - all you need are your walking shoes! The Westin truely exceeded our expectations and we will definetly stay here when we return to Florence!

<Content>A true delight I was there in March 2004 with 2 friends. From the pre-trip emails to the 5 a.m. taxi when departing this wondereful hotel, we were never disappointed. The rooms were comfortable  quiet (between the outside shades  heavy drapes, the traffic of the always busy street below was rarely heard). The staff were always friendly  helpful, from the bellmen, desk clerks, concierge, restaurant waiters, and maids. We had a gorgeous view of the Arno and Oltrano area from our balcony. I don't want to be too gushy about the hotel's perfection, so to be honest, I do have one complaint - the chandelier in our room was slightly crooked! Again, I can't say enough about the staff, they appeared to really enjoy their jobs. Or maybe they just enjoy people in general. Management should be commended for their excellent choice of staff. It made our first trip to Italy very memorable and eager to return.

<Content>excellent service and location the concierge service was amazing. they got us reserved entrance times to the museums on short notice, book rental cars and restaurants and gave great suggestions. the room was very good (great bed). the only flaw was that the bathroom was sub-par, and very dark. surprising given the cost.

<Content>The Westin Excelsior, Florence - Excellent Just want to endorse what everyone else says, this is a superb hotel. A big part of that is down to the wonderful, helpful and friendly staff. If breakfast is not included in your rate then the breakfast is extraordinarly expensive. Another option is go out of the hotel, turn right, right again and fifty metres along on the other side of the road is a small cafe where you can get a coffee and pastry for a couple of euros. Much more fun.

<Content>Pampered This is the second time I've stayed here and enjoyed it just as much as before. Our room over looked the Arno with 2 small stan-on balconies and double french doors. How delightful to watch the sun set from there and the night lights on the river. Our room was large and very comfortable. But the highlight of this hotel is the staff. This time the conceirge, Andrea, was so helpful, even arranging tickets to the next night's sold out soccer game...and excellent seats as that. When you want to feel pampered, respected, and charmed, this is your hotel. I like it just a bit off the main tourist area so it's quiet. The black out drapes allow you to sleep til noon while you sweep away the jet lag.
