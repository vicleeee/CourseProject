<Content>old room, small bed The hotel staff were kind enough to guarantee non smoking-connected room for us.. however the hotel was not what we really need. The 1 room was so big that it has a separate wardrobe room but it has a very small bed. The sofa was so old we even ask a bed sheet to cover it since we don't feel like sit on it. The connected room is quite small but okay, again the bed were small.The price was too expensive for the room quality. It's not convinience to go to MTR. The hotel was surrounded with branded shop but a little walk will lead you to smaller shop and small dining place. The hotel lobby were new but the hotel room just old... simply old... a 5 star hotel that still use a real key to open its door... and again the bed.... just so smalllll.... nice pillow menu ( free) but with so many pillow and so small bed??? it just not right. Another thing... the breakfast only good for 1 person, it's quite strange and unusual... not nice!!!

<Content>Par for the price Stayed at the Marco Polo hotel for 1 night from November 18 to 19 for the first time. Check in was quick and efficient however when I got to room no light was working and I called the reception. A person from housekeeping arrived 5 minutes later with some light bulbs and quickly realized that some more serious was wrong as it was all light which did not work. She mentioned the need to call an engineer after which I went down to the reception to change my room - not exactly what you want after a 16 hours trip from Europe!I got a new room quickly and everything worked fine. The room was very large with a separate pantry but with some old-fashioned and worn fixtures and furniture. The TV was so small that it was not possible to see it from the bed. The internet speed was fine (should be at HKD 120,- for 24 hours) and breakfast arrived in the morning exactly on time. Check-out was quick and efficient.In conclusion the stay was more or less what I expected. It is a middle class business hotel and I got what I paid for - the fact that I was checked into a room where nothing worked however pulls down on my evaluation.

<Content>Pretty Good I booked directly via the hotel website. They have some good deals over there so be sure to look before you book from any place else. The location of the hotel is absolutely fantastic. It is connected to Harbor City, which is one of the largest mall of HKG. I took the airport express from the airport to Kowloon station. From there I took the complimentary shuttle bus K2 which drops you outside the hotel. The lobby is nothing fantastic. They had a lot of people behind the check desk in but for some reason they took more than 5 minutes to check me in when there was just 1 person ahead of me. The lobby was teeming with people. Then I found out that the hotel was celebrating the Octoberfest on the 6th floor and the only access for people was thru the hotel elevators. They gave me a club floor room. I had to go to the 17th floor where there was another reception. There was a strange smell on the 17th floor, maybe because it was heavily wooded and it could be the wood smell. They gave me my room key. I had requested a non smoking room and as I opened there was a terrible stale smoke smell that was emanating from the room. The room in itself was very very average. I was shocked that this was the upgraded room. I went back to the reception and told that I could not take this room as it was smelling. So they gave me another room on the 8th floor. This room was great. A piece of advise. If they want to give you a club level room, dont take it. The room I had was on a regular floor but it was huge, with a seperate walk in closet and bath and shower area. There were also 2 basins. This room was substantially better than the so called club floor rooms. The hotel does not have a gym but they have tied up with another fitness center which is about a 5 minute walk called Fitness First. You will see flyers on the floor saying that you can ask to use the place for HKD 55, but just ask the concierge and he will give you a free VIP pass. The location is amazing. If you want to go to HKG Island just use the Star ferry. The pier is located opposite to the back entrance of the hotel. It costs HKD 2.2 to go to either Wanchai or Central. Subway costs 8.5 and the station is at 5-7 minute walk from the hotel. Breakfast was good, mine was included in the rate. Overall is a good hotel for the price. I paid an average of HKD 1550 per night for 2 nights, which considering Hong Kong is pretty good. On the way back I took the airport express back and so could check in my luggage and get my boarding pass etc at the station. No worry about lugging luggage to the airport.

<Content>You pay for the view.... We decided to upgrade to a harbour view suite which was a lovely large room on the 8th floor with a wonderful view of the harbour. However it was very expensive and you would have to sit in the room all day looking at the view to get your moneys worth (they know how to charge for the view!).We were on our way home after several weeks in cramped rooms in Europe so we really enjoyed the space and the view - but there are probably better value rooms and hotels in Hong Kong.However if money is not the issue you would find a harbour view suite in the MP hard to beat.

<Content>Quality Hotel in an amazing location We stayed at this hotel for 2 days on our way back from OZ. I can honestly say for price /location / quality this is by far the best hotel we have ever stayed in. We were met on arrival and taken up to our room. We checked in inside the room. Our bags were taken up for us. This was such a nice persinal touch. The rooms are v spacious (not what we expected) We had two adjoining rooms in the corner of the hotel with an internal door which was perfect for our family of five. The rooms were clean, comfortable and had cable tv. This hotel is part of a huge shopping complex called harbour city and has wonderful views of the bay. It is also next to star ferry terminal where we found the tourist info. It is served from the airport by the MTR then a free hotel bus K4 I think but it is all well advertised on arrival. I can heartily recommend this hotel to anyone going to Hong Kong, you wont be dissapointed. We paid 拢75 per room per night which considering it was in the middle of the olympics we were pleased with. The only minor negative is the bar is expensive but walk outside the hotel and you will find plenty of choice so not a problem.

<Content>Good location Stayed 4N in SeptBooked through travel agent, paid about 1700 HK for deluxe room including buffet breakfastStayed on 8th floor with 2 year old, no view, overlooked table tennis table and concrete courtyardCheck in was smooth and quick, lobby faces lane crawfordWere given some vouchers for free drinks in the lobby loungeRoom was spacious, clean but old. Definitely no luxurious feel, but above average.Breakfast also above average for hotel buffet but not spectacular.Location is great - right in middle of mall, next to star ferry, conv to get food etc. No need to walk out into the sweltering heat. Bit far from MTR but mainly we took cabs around as we had to lug stroller etc. Cabs are cheap and easily available.All in all - recommended for the location and especially if you can get a good rate like us, but not if you are looking for a real luxurious experience.

<Content>Do not forget to check your credit card statement for your stay My colleague and I stayed 2 seperate rooms at Marcopolo Hong Kong hotel on the night of 25 July 2008. This hotel was reserved by our supplier as we had an early meeting next morning and their company is on the same compund with walking distance of the hotel. My stay was fine. The room was clean and breakfast was great. I did pay for the 2 rooms with my credit card with the total charge of HKD 3,025. There should not be a problem but I found out on my statement that there was another transaction of HKD 35 charged on my credit card on that same day in which I already paid for them because of direct debit. The hotel charged this amount and got authorization without having a signature on any sales slip. I emailed to the hotel 2 times but yet receive no response. I know it's only HKD 35 but if it's not only I that have this problem or the amount could be more. This hotel is nice if you just wanna shop at Ocean Terminal but it is considerbly far from MRT and other malls. The experiences there were great but you could have better things with the same amount of money at another hotel.

<Content>Classy with large spacious rooms Stayed for 4 nights, July 2008 on a business trip. Was initially booked into a single room, however, upon check-in, the counter-staff very kindly upgraded me into a deluxe room. Counter-staff were polite and efficient and porters readily stored my luggage for a couple of hours as I arrived on an early flight. Hotel is centrally located on Kowloon side, right next to the Star Ferry terminal and directly above the monstrous Harbour City Shopping Centre. Harbour City has hundreds of shops and restaurants, very easy to get a meal. There's a Wellcome grocers in the mall if you need supplies. Only drawback is that the nearest MTR station, Tsim Tsa Tshui is about a 10min walk although riding the Star Ferry is probably more scenic and convenient. The deluxe room was on the 15th floor, and was brilliant. It was a corner room, hence very spacious unlike most HK hotels. Walk-in wardrobe provided. Bed consisted of two twins together, pillows were soft and comfy (pillow menu provided - cheers!) and sheets well-laundered. Toilet with attached bath was clean and did not smell. Rooms well-serviced, and a turn-down provided in the evening. Room seemed rather dim, possibly due to its large size! All rooms had fast broadband access, charges were high but noticed that there's a cheap internet cafe next to the McD's just round the back. Nice room furniture (2 sofas and armchairs), if not slightly old.Enjoyed my stay; liked the helpful staff and elegant room. Deserves it's 5 stars and will be back again.

<Content>Fantastic view of the Victoria Harbour There were some works going on in the street when we stayed there in May. But since we chose a habour view room, everything was great! The room is spacious and fantastic view of the Victoria Harbour, especially in the evening when all the building are lighten up on HK island. We were on 9th floor. I believe if we chose a higher floor, the view must be even better.We liked very much the walk-in closet and bathroom. The in room dining was also wonderful.The only thing we didn't like was the hotel entry. You have to take stairs in order to get to the reception and lift. WIth a young kid with us, it was not very convenient. But the staff was always ready to help!

<Content>My Best Bet in HK I stayed only one night June 24 en route from China to Los Angeles. I booked a superior room (215 USD on the hotel website and when I arrived I was upgraded to a deluxe room; huge room with substantial bathroom. Marco Polo HK is always clean and my best bet for staying where I feel safe and can shop and eat nearby at Ocean Center/Gateway shops and Canton Road. I've stayed here on all my trips to Asia and have not been disappointed. This time my room had a slight musty smell, but that seemed to go away when the air conditioner was turned off; surprisingly, the room stayed reasonably cool. My experience with the front desk was smooth as was the business office (use of internet).

<Content>Great Location Good Enough Hotel My husband are just back from a 10 night stay in Hong Kong and had a wonderful holiday. We found the Marco Polo to be very accommodating. We selected to stay in the Club floor level and paid extra for a room with a view over the harbour I have to say it was well worth the extra money. The breakfast, afternoon tea and evening buffet and drinks more than made up for the extra cost from the standard rooms and the standards maintained within the Club lounge were excellent. I have to say this level was used more by business people or travelling couples like ourselves, I'm not convinced it would have been a comfortable experience for children. The layout of the club level is very much old English with the oak panelled walls, china cups and saucers, silver cutlery and white gloved waiters etc, if this is not for you then I would select elsewhere. I would agree the rooms are somewhat dated but at the end of the day they had everything we could have wanted, were large by hong kong standards and more importantly the bed was very comfortable. I would definately return to this hotel. I would also point out the hotel is accessed via a shopping mall containing what would appear to be hundreds of shops to suit all purses so if you like shopping you can't go wrong here.

<Content>Very disappointed Having had the Marco Polo recommended by 2 people we had high expectations for our 2 night stop over. We were disappointed. Room was very dated, large room but no view. The bed was one of the worst beds that I have ever slept on. It was so hardThe location of the hotel is excellent, close to the star ferry (very cheap way to get to HK island) and great shops around the hotel. We ate the Cucina restaurant and that was great, would highly, recommend they have a western and Chinese menu, the staff were excellent there, extremely friendly and helpful.Had breakfast included in our package and that one of the highlights of our stay. Would recommend the buffet breakfast.The staff at check in/out were helpful but concierge was a different storey. Having booked the Discovery package, we had a limousine transfer included. With our flight leaving early in the morning we wanted to get the Limousine back to the airport early but we were told this would an extra charge (even thought flight details were provided at time of booking). They eventually agreed to not charge extra if we left 15 minutes later than we wanted to. But again on the morning when we left, they tried to get us to pay extra again.Be aware if you book the Discovery Package it is extremely frustrating as they staff don鈥檛鈥?look at your booking details and wanted to charge extra for everything that was included in the package, luckily we a good receptionist at check out who spent 5 minutes sorting out for us.We wouldn鈥檛 stay here again, would much rather stay on HK Island and eat in SOHO.

<Content>great location, ok hotel! Stayed here for work in early may - have stayed in various hotels around HK - thought this was ok / mid range - great handy location for star ferry / TST and kowloon, and very big rooms - felt the hotel could do with a bit of tarting up - I think some rooms are substantially better than others, but all clean and comfy - also Obliging / helpful staffFood quality was mixedVery confusing for taxi trivers as there are 3 marco polos on the same road - worth having it in chinese to make sure you get the right one - and equally if there are a few of you in a group then make sure you've all boked into the same one!!would stay again if a good rate was available - however paid less to stay in langham place 6 months ago, and whilst the location wasn't so central was a much nicer hotel for same rate

<Content>Hotel with Superb Shopping Location This hotel has a splendid location for shopaholics. The moment you step out from the hotel premise, rows and rows of retail outlets awaits you. Rooms are big by Hong Kong standard but lack of luxury  personal touch, and breakfast serves is above average.This is a recommended hotel for travellers coming to Hong Kong for shopping, eating, sightseeing or even for stopover etc.

<Content>Quite dated but OK The hotel is in a great location, less than 10 minutes to the ferry terminal, and two streets from Nathan Road. It is joined to a shopping centre with a real assortment of shops....Very expensive designer boutiques down to a supermarket and pharmacist! The room was a generous size, but rather dated. The bathroom was huge, with the shower over the bath, a toilet and sink set in a vanity unit. There was a safety deposit box in the wardrobe at no charge. Everthing was perfectly clean, and the maid replaced the towels daily. We were on the front of the hotel overlooking the street and I assume the room was triple glazed or soundproofed as it was silent. we were room only, so cannot comment on breakfats. The bar is very nice, on the ground floor with big windows looking onto the street.All in all a good hotel in a great location, but in need of a face lift.And if you get sick of Chinese food, the Hard Rock cafe is over the road!

<Content>Much better than expected Having booked the Hotel Marco Polo Hongkong mainly due to its location, we were slightly worried given some less than fabulous reviews on tripAdvisor.However, we were more than pleasantly surprised! The hotel is very chic, clean and of a high standard. The front desk staff were excellent and extremely helpful - esp. when our flight from Sydney was delayed on the outbound trip.Excellent location, very big rooms - ours overlooked the pool area - with plenty of storage space and a great bathroon with shower and full size bath!On our first night, we ate at the Cucina restaurant which is within the hotel complex and the food, wine and cocktails were fabulous! Our waiter was exceptional, knowledgeable and very friendly without being intrusive.We would most definitely stay here again.

<Content>Impressive and affordable The hotel is located at the bottom end of Canton Rd. It is convenienty located close to the Star Ferry and has a free shuttle bus pick up/drop off point next door which takes you to Cowloon MTR; Very useful if your planning to catch the express train to/from the airport, cos there is no need to push luggage around the street to get to the closest MTR station. I personally loved the convenience of the shuttle service particularly given we had to catch an early flight. First shutte service at 6:15am. The room we stayed in was spacious with a separate 'walk in robe' room where we hung our clothing, stored a suitcase and left all our shopping. The minbar and safe are also in that room.The business centre is open 24hours a day which was good when we wanted to get on the NET outside the peak usage times. Room service was not that impressive. The food was a bit bland.The new restaurant/bar (Cuccina) has a great view of the harbour. We were given two free cocktail vouchers to use on our next visit to the bar. The drinks were average in quality, and the bar staff offer a little dish containing caramelised nuts and rice crackers with the drinks.

<Content>Utterly fabulous harbour view room There may be a better location for a hotel room in Hong Kong, but I doubt it. After reading the TripAdvisor reviews I booked a harbour view room at the Marco Polo, and we were not disappointed. Our room was HUGE - enormous king sized bed, big bathroom, luggage / minibar in a separate little room, and more than enough room left over for my 4-year-old son to have a single bed in the main room. But most impressive was the view. We were on the 9th floor, looking out directly over the pier where the cruise ships dock on Kowloon. We could see the Star Ferry pier just a little way to the left, and we were looking out right across the harbour at Hong Kong. My husband and I spent a couple of hours watching the sun go down over the harbour and the lights come on, as my son slept in the room behind us. Magic.We didn't eat at the hotel at all. There are good and cheap restaurants and some convenience stores just a few blocks away. We wanted a nice stopover for a couple of nights, with a view that would be interesting no matter what time our jetlagged selves were awake, and the Marco Polo delivered brilliantly.

<Content>A great hotel in a great location We stayed for 3 nights having stayed at the Metropark Kowloon last time. The Metropark was too far out of the action so we opted for location this time.We weren't disappointed! You can cut through Ocean Plaza straight to the Star Ferry. We booked a Harbour View room and this was well worth the extra cost. The views at night are stunning.Our room was a corner one and it had a sitting area plus a dressing room! The staff were efficient and friendly.We opted for the buffet breakfast which was slightly on the expensive side but there was plenty of choice. The only drawback is that it took them ages to bring your tea or coffee!We didn't eat in the hotel in the evenings. One gem is Dan Ryan's in the Ocean Plaza (on the route from reception to the Star Ferry) It's a little difficult to locate as the entrance is tucked away but it is based on an American diner and the food is good and reasonably priced.We ould definitely book the Marco Polo again.

<Content>Location, Location, Location! We have just returned from a fantastic holiday which started with a 3 night stay at the fabulous Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel, on Kowloon.The hotel is ideally located right next to the Star Ferry terminal, which you will have to use to get over to Hong Kong Island. Other nearby points of interest include Nathan Road, the ladies and night markets and the promenade directly opposite offer a fantastic view point for the evening light show across the harbour.It is a typical 5* business style hotel but seemed to cater for both business, families and couples alike during our stay.At check-in, we were surprised with a room upgrade - a huge executive style suite.Breakfast was in the form of a buffet -serving international cuisine from a good old English fry-up, continental pastries and meats, etc...If you are wondering whether to stay on Hong kong island OR Kowloon my advice to you would be Kowloon. The tourist sights are split evently (easily reached by the Star ferry) but there is more to do in the evenings on Kowloon vs. the more expensive and business orientated Hong Kong Island.One negative however - which really disspaointed my hubby - was that the advertised gym/fitness centre is not located in this hotel but it the sister hotel 5 minutes away, with a daily fee. This is not made clear on the website. Even though they offer a free shuttle to the sister hotel, after a day of sightseeing hopping on a nother bus was the last thing he wanted to do.All in all though - a great hotel, the best location and fantastic service. Enjoy!

<Content>Great hotel - cannot fault it I simply cannot fault this hotel. A really great location, in Kowloon and adjacent to the huge Harbour City Shopping Centre. Very close to the Star Ferry which takes you across to Hong Kong Island . Also it is in the heart of the vibrant and incredibly busy shopping areas although I was there at the time of the Chinese New Year.I had a Harbour View room - 1057 and think it was worth the extra cost - great views across to Hong Kong Island. I didn't use the restaurant but had breakfast via room service- very efficient. I used the lobby lounge for a snack - very attentive service.I hadn't been to Hong Kong before but would certainly stay here again and for the tourrist would recommend they stay in Kowloon as opposed to Hong Kong Island.

<Content>Funny Smell at Marco Polo! We stayed here on a 2 night stoppover from Australia to London. The exec floor is decorated as an English Gentleman's Club - all leather and polished wood - and we think that must have been the source of the smell! Not exactly nasty, but not exactly pleasant - the entire 17th and 18th floords of this hotel have a distinctive niff! Other than that the rooms are large and well appointed with nice bathrooms that have plenty of towels. The exec lounge serves breakfast. light lunch, afternoon tea and cocktails and is a pleasant place to wait for your hotel transfer if you have a late night flight back to the UK. The most disappointing feature is the very limited harbour view (if you have made a point of booking a harbour view room or suite). You will have a good view into the cruise ship terminal with glimpses of the Hong Kong skyline from side windows - not exactly as advertised! A reasonable hotel - but I'd stay at the Langham for the same money.

<Content>Pure luxury Well, after staying in budget accommodation we splashed out and planned to spend NYE in luxury and let me tell you we were not disappointed.Our agent had stuffed up and instead of 3 beds we only had 1 huge bed (two singles pushed together) but this bed was soooo huge we were able to sleep 3 of us in the one bed. I have to say this was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.The room was large, bathroom was large and plenty of wardrobe space - oved the robes and slippers.The view was ok - we had harbour glimpses and a great view of the building work that was going on next door. Room service was great. The pool was rather special, plenty of room for sunbathing. Towels are provided and the attendants serve you a glass of water once you find your seat. There is a trick to entering through the waterfalls though. We had a great view of the NYE fireworks and all in all it was a great stay.

<Content>TAke your allergy pills if you stay here We stayed here while on a business trip. 2 days in Hon Kong on our way into the Mainland and 1 day on the way back to the States. The location of the Hotel is great. Easy access to shopping, business meetings and great areas for going out. The breakfast buffet was only o.k. The rooms were TERRIBLE---they smelled of mold. I changed rooms twice and all the rooms smelled the same. I checked with my colleagues and they had the same experience. The hotel was also packed with young people in town to have a party and the staff wasn't inclined to ask the drunkards running up and down the hall at 3am to be quiet. Spend $40 more per night and get a better hotel.

<Content>Great location Had high expectations of this hotel was slightly disappointed. It's not a deluxe hotel by any stretch of the imagination, it probably was in the 1980's. The hotel has been given a face lift with new soft furnishings, but the furniture and bathroom is still a little dated. Harbour view rooms are worth the upgrade, although you do have to crane your neck for the bright lights of Hong Kong island, I did have a good view of Kowloon harbour though. The hotel is located directly in the designer shopping district and just a 5 minute walk from the Star Ferry (which apparently runs every 30 minutes, it cost less than 20p to get across to the Island). Would I stay here again? Probably not, I would prefer to stay on the Island itself and come across on the ferry to then look back at the Island for the impressive skyline (most impressive at night).

<Content>It's a Great exxperience1 Basically, there's nothing really extraordinary about this hotel, and i do not mean that in a bad way. it's not a grand luxury hotel, but it's really great, comfy and worth the money you paid for.The rooms are big, we were a party of six but we only needed two rooms which were even beyond the space we needed. The beds were adequate for us; big, spacious and comfy. After a whole day of shopping till we dropped, three people could even curl up in just one bed. Since we're so tired we no longer moved while we slept. the beds were really comfy and catered to our tired bodies, like a reward after a whole day of walking and sightseeing. A cute thing i even noticed about Marco Polo's nocturnal services is that they even provided a pillow menu for the needs of different people. as i was reading through the menu I felt like sleeping. This pillow menu, I'm not sure if it has a charge for it, but i just found it to be really amusing.The bathroom is ok too, a bathtub, a big mirror and a toilet is already enough for me, especially that they're clean and tidy. There were no suspicious gunks or dust bunnies or dirt we saw in the bathroom, but the showers are mounted onto the wall. The showers were my biggest problem because i was used to using the movable type, and this 'new' habit seemed to disrupt my habits of bathing. There was free tea bags and a thermos for us to use. I have a tip though, they have complimentary water, but it is in the fridge, you've gotta be nosy to find it. I think they kept the free water in the fridge because hotel refrigerators connote expenses, and they were overcharging us to buy Evian water worth 68 HK$ before having the free water. I really liked the location of this hotel, just go down the elevator and get out of the lobby you're already in a mall. it's the Ocean Centre, but if you're looking for bargains this posh mall does not have those things for you. But, if you got out of the hotel there's a lot more stores and malls, this time not all of them are posh anymore. This hotel is not that close to the MTR station though, but a few minutes of walking will already do.I'd really like to stay here again, it was a great experience to stay in this marco Polo, just open the fridge for the free water!

<Content>Great location We stayed here on the first leg of our honeymoon in October. The room was nicely furnished and comfortable with a great view of the harbour, though there was a bit of a musty smell, but it wasn't too bad. The staff were friendly and helpful and there was a very good selection for breakfast. This is a good standard hotel, but the best thing about it is the location, which is perfect. You are on Kowloon, walkable to Nathan Road and the Peninsula, a short taxi to the Temple Street night market and right by the Star Ferry terminal to go and explore Hong Kong Island. This is the hotel's real plus point.

<Content>Needs a refit Have been staying here for a few years. Other then the excellent location this hotel has to offer, there is not much else. Rooms need to be redone, especially the bathrooms. Electrical plugs do not accommodate North American or European plugs, something that most modern hotels have now days. Staff is also not up to par to most so called 4 or 5 star hotels. The large insect I found in my room finally made me realize that this was my last stay at this establishment. There are so many other choices in Kowloon.

<Content>An terrific hotel in a fab position The Marco Polo is on Kowloon - the mainland - overlooking Hong Kong island and right on the waterfront. Make sure you ask for a harbour view room because the views are absolutely spectacular. It's also perfectly positioned right next to the Star Ferry terminal, so getting across to Hong Kong takes no time by ferry (the only way to do the crossing!) The hotel has all the amenities you'd expect and our room was a good size, with plenty of storage and a functional if somewhat uninspiring bathroom (the shower is over the bath) and generous sink area (which is outside the bathroom). But the bed was as hard as nails, so be warned! We ate in the buffet restaurant for breakfast and dinner one evening - lots of choice and all of it delicious. The hotel also links directly into a vast shopping centre, so it's dangerously easy to make and carry back your purchases!

<Content>Not Bad but Could be Better We stayed at the Marco Polo Hong Kong for a week from 10th Sept this year. The hotel was fine, nice  clean and the staff were OK. We'd read some reviews about the staff and to be honest things didn't sound good but we didn't experience anything like that. We found them all to be pleasant enough. My big problem with the hotel was the noise. We stayed a week and it felt like we had no sleep the whole time we were there. There was building work at the hotel, which we were warned about, but it did finish at 5pm every day so it wasn't a problem as we were never in the room during the day anyway but what our tour agent didn't tell us was they were doing building work next door (Marco Polo is part of a big complex called Harbour City and this is where the noise came from). They hammered, drilled and loaded skips and did what ever it is builders do, all night, every night apart from Sunday. We did complain on several occasions but the hotel staff said there was nothing they could about it. We thought we might get a chance to change to a quieter room but the only way they would move us was if we upgraded and paid extra so in that respect they were a bit unhelpful. All in all the hotel was OK and I would stay there again because the location really couldn't be any better but I would make sure that there is no building work going on first!

<Content>Excellent Restaurant We spent 2 nights at the Marco Polo Prince enroute from Ireland to Australia. Our room was a good size and comfortably accomodated 2 adults and 2 children.We had no complaints, and 2 points of commendation:(a) Location - within the Harbour City shopping centre - which not only meant good shopping (!) but also it was possible to walk indoors almost all the way to the Star Ferry - thereby avoiding the humidity and rain of Hong Kong.(b) The Spice Market Restaurant - within the Hotel - is excellent. We booked in advance (after breakfast that morning) for an evening meal. It was a superb oriental spice buffet meal. The variety of food was excellent, and there was plenty for the children and adults to enjoy! We really enjoyed it.

<Content>Unfriendly Staff / Services My husband and I stayed there for 3 nights. The location is great. Rooms are bigger than the other hotels we've stayed but the bathroom needs update. The services from the staffs were unacceptable for the name and reputation that the hotel carried. The staffs were racially discrimenated. They are actually nicer to foreigners (white people) than to their natives. When the staffs were spoken to Chinese they rather replied in English. So we were forced to speak English to them rather than in native tongues in order to get a better service. We find this pathetic. Marco Polo should train their staffs better. The staffs needs to learn how to greet their guests and to put a smile on their faces. Now is that very hard for a 5 stars hotel?

<Content>Pool shut in the very hot peak summer season !! Stayed here on 13th - 14th Aug 2007. The check in was a long drawn out annoying affair with a poor english speaking unwelcoming receptionist. One of the main reasons I booked this hotel was because of the outdoor pool in the very hot and humid heat of the Hong Kong summer. I was annoyed to find a discreet note in my room explaining that the pool was closed for renovations until 2/11/07. A poor decision by management - why not December, January etc? Rather annoying when you have 2 young kids keen to swim!! If I had known about this closure I would have cancelled. I was not notified unsurprisingly. When I asked the receptionist I was told that I had could use an indoor pool in a local YMCA!. Not what I expect for a supposed 4 star hotel. The room was not bad however the bathroom was tiny and in bad need of renovation. The only positive thing about this hotel was its superb location. I would not stay here again though, far better in Hong Kong.

<Content>Unfriendly  Unfriendly Front Desk Staff (Check-in Counter Personnel) Very Arrogant Front Liner. I only asked this guy named Nathan if our room has a nice view, the answer I got was  Don't expect a nice view for this rate, ( superior room booking) with matching very arrogant facial expression . He even started a confrontation when i reacted by the way she treated us ( my husband and i). I CAN'T recommend this hotel. They even have this pin with service with smile logo but they (the hotel staff) don't even practice it. Beware of that arrogant guy named NATHAN. He ruined our 4day trip to Hong Kong. Even though we reported him to the duty manager (Johnny Ng) the manager did not do anything to discipline his staff. Everytime we go out of the hotel during our stay in Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel this guy keeps on watching us with his provocative eyes. We will never ever stay in that Hotel again. VERY VERY POOR IN CUSTOMER SERVICE.

<Content>How can you miss? i always stay at the marco polo. How can you go wrong when it is beside Lane Crawford and cuts through Ocean Terminal and the Ferry boats. The rooms are clean and decent. They just refurbished but kept the height and spread of the rooms so you are not too claustrophobic . Service is good and the front desk is quite accomodating. i got an upgrade and did not even have to ask for one. I have been to this hotel as a single traveller , with friends, and once with two kids. Never had a problem with anything except for too much shopping.

<Content>Has it ups and downs Close to so many highlights in the city, but hotel is quite old. Needs a good renovation. I am picky when it comes to bathrooms and wasn't entirely happy with it. The bedrooms are ok. Good for a short stay. The best thing about it is its location, but the hotel needs a good make-over.

<Content>Loved Hong Kong not the Marco Polo The location is the only thing they have going for them. The rooms were outdated. The pool and fitness center were closed. I had trouble getting assistance at the concierge desk and the breakfast was horrible. It is only of the best locations. Walking distance to the Star Ferry, shopping and a short cab ride to the night markets. More expensive than the rest of china but affordable. Highly reccomend the city but not the hotel until it has been renovated.

<Content>Fantastic location - scruffy rooms The foyer of the hotel is luxurious but the rooms are tired and very dirty. Carpet was the sort your feet stick to!! We were offered an upgrade at a price but as we were only here for a few nights and were sightseeing all day we didn't bother. Location is however wonderful - walking distance of the Star ferry and on top of the shops. There was a free shuttle bus from the Kowloon station and on our journey to the airport we were able to check in our luggage at the station and then catch the train without lugging our cases. Hong Kong was just great - a good start to our 3 month round the world trip.

<Content>excellent location and great value for money I stayed at the Marco Polo Hongkong for 3 nights in late March. After reading some of the reviews on here after booking it I was a little apprehensive however our experience was excellent. The location is second to none and the staff were very helpful. The rum bar in the lobby is excellent. They are just completing re-furbishments of the pool area which means that there are no gym facilities but the pool is fine. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for comfortable, good value for money accomodation in a stunning location.

<Content>Great Stay This was our first trip to Hong Kong and we were staying at the Marco Polo Hong Kong because we had won three nights in an auction. We extended our stay to 6nights as I am sure you will agree it is a very long way to go just for 3 nights we also took along our 16 year old daughter who shared our room. I have nothing negative to say about this hotel. Our trip was 1st class from start to finish. Starting with our journey from the airport in the hotels chaffeur driven merc, the offer of bottled water when we got into the car at the airport was a well received gesture. The staff were waiting for the car to arrive and from that point our luggage was taken care of and was delivered to our room immediately . We were escorted to our room which over looked the harbour and as it was the chinese new year we had a fantastic view from our room of the fireworks. A nice touch was having the bed covers turned every evening, although a chocolate would have been nice. The tea, coffee and bottled water were replemished everyday,as was the tolietries. The location of this hotel sold it to us. I don't know if we had a lovely room with a view because of the auction win but it made our 1st trip to HK very enjoyable, if I had a complaint it would be the cost and standard of the breakfast, at approx 拢15 each I thought it was expensive for a full english and although 3 nights included the breakfast for the remaining nights we chose to have breakfast in the surrounding eaterys i.e mcdonalds starbucks and others in the mall. I would love to stay at this hotel again if we could guarantee the same standard of room as we have just had but I have an open mind reading some of the other reviews but I can only speak as I found and therefore I if only recommend this hotel for nothing else it's location location location it stands right next to the star ferries which go backwards and forwards to Hong Kong Island and I suggest that when travelling around HK you get yourselves a octpus card which you are charged a fee for and like the oyster cards in London you put money on these cards but unlike London when you have finished if you haven't used all the money on the cards you will get a refund on these cards and you also get the initial fee returned you can use the card on trains buses and ferries and all of the transport around HK is cheap including the taxis. Our trip ended with the limo taking us back to airport and has we had a very late flight back to London we able to stay in our room untill 9pm which was close to the time we were being collected for the airport.

<Content>okay but don't want to stay here again. At the first, I booked the standard room through the asiabesthotel.com but it was too small and has no space for the extra bed,so they said the extra bed is $ 350/night but if we upgrade to the deluxe room is $650 more /night and it was include a extra bed so we did. we stayed at a deluxe room 3-19-07 thru 3-22-07 with my parent and my 2 years old son. also on 3-25-07. the twin beds were not enough for 3 and half people. so we had to ask for the extra bed. the room definately need to be updated, smells of the room like humid mold...but the location was very convienient and service of the hotel was helpful. all the furnitures are very very old...(but it doen't means antique) everything we could bear but the smell of the room was quite bothering whenever we come in. next time we will try other hotel, I do not want to recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Excellent Location I've stayed here a few times, as this is where my parents stay when on business in HK. It's a great hotel, right next to the Star Ferry in Kowloon, and is hugely cheaper than its Island counterparts. On my first visit to HK in 2001 I stayed in a hotel in North Point, which was just too far away from Central.My only criticism on my last trip is that a school party totally took over the pool whilst I was swimming. I complained, but the staff weren't interested and didn't offer an apology - neither did the so-called responsible teachers.Other than that, the restaurants are nice, and you are close to the Penninsula Hotel if you want to have a drink at Bar Felix and see how the other half live ;-)

<Content>Great for a short stay This hotel is fine if you are just planning to spend little time in your room and head out to explore Hong Kong. Its decor is not much to write home about and it is a faceless hotel located in the middle of a shopping mall but very convenient for exploring Kowloon and the Star Ferry to hong Kong Island. The breakfasts were great and staff friendly enough and very accommodating.

<Content>Loved the Marco Polo HK My mum and I stayed at the Marco Polo HK for 7 nights and loved it. We booked through BA website for a good rate and were also upgraded to a Harbour View Deluxe room on check in, which was spacious with a pantry room to store luggage and clothes and to make drinks, a big bathroom and a study area. The room had a beautiful view of HK Island and was a really good spot for watching the 8:00pm laser shows and the Star Ferry coming and going.Housekeeping were excellent too, they would clean the room when they turned down the sheets at night and would always greet you. The Harbour City shopping Centre next door is very handy, as is the location of the hotel close to TST MTR and all the shops in Nathan Road, Peking Road etc. Contrary to other reviews I read, the beds were also really comfortable and we heard no noise either. Perfect after a day's shopping and sightseeing! Concierge also kindly stored our luggage for us whilst we went to China for a short trip. PS The Chinese Restaurant at the nearby Star House does really good dim sum.

<Content>Marco polo hotel hong kong We have just stayed at the Marco Polo Hotel Hong Kong (the biggest one of the three Marco polos in Hong Kong) and were very disappointed. Staff were rather cheeky with flippant comments, service very slow and we did not get the deluxe harbour view rooms we paid for and ordered (ours overlooked a noisy construction site!)Many people were complaining. We will not recommend this hotel or return.

<Content>Underwhelmed For a supposedly four-star hotel that charges that much, we were a little disappointed for what we paid for.We spent about 10 days at the hotel, with a break of 4 days in the middle of the stay for a sidetrip to mainland China. The first portion of our stay (3 days) we were upgraded to a so-called deluxe room, that is bigger than average size hotel room, but the room is sparsely furnished because of its size and the decor is a bit tired and needed some refresh, and it didn't have any view. When we returned from our mainland trip, we were given first a regular room (which is much smaller) and it was a smoking room! We had definitely requested a non-smoking room but we had to wait till the following day, and were then given an even smaller room with a very small bathroom. On top of that the bed in this room was extremely hard and we actually had to request extra bedding to make it bearable. Housekeeping came in and inserted a thin foam mattress (about an-inch thick) on top of the hard mattress that is supposed to provide a softer surface. It didn't and it made it worse because the thin foam mattress was smaller than the mattress, so the bed now was uneven around the edges!Since both the exercise room and the pool were closed for renovation,hotel guests had to pay out of their own pocket if they wanted to exercise in a gym near-by.When we checked out, there were daily charges of snacks and drinks from the in-room wet-bar and fridge that we never even touched. We disputed that and they took out the charges.The hotel location is great as mentioned in other reviews, but that is really what you pay for, the location. We have stayed in three different rooms and the rooms are average at best, service wasn't remarkable, and there is hardly any facilities provided by the hotel. I don't think it merits a four-star class rating.Overall, I think the hotel is overpriced for the quality of the room and services that it provides.

<Content>A Big Dissapointment! I was excited to go and stay at the Marco Polo HK Hotel bec it's supposedly better than Gateway. Whenever we go to HK, we stay at the Marco Polo Gateway. We were happy with the rooms/suite they gave us before. When my husband contacted the MPHK to book 2 rooms for Feb07, we were assured a free upgrade to a deluxe room. They gave us a confirmation number and all.Upon checking in, computer showed that they accidentally CANCELLED our booking and gave away our rooms to other guests. Then they had a hard time finding us 2 rooms! After 1.5 hours in the lobby, they finally found 2 rooms for us. If we paid extra, they will give us a suite. Thinking a suite would be nice splurge, we agreed to pay extra. We ended up getting a deluxe room connected to a suite.Having high expectations, I thought we would get nicer rooms. WE DIDN'T. Suite wasn't available till 7pm. So we got the Deluxe first. IT WAS TINY! Hardly any space to move around. around 40sqm only. They had the nerve to call it a deluxe. I wonder how the standard rooms looked. But we were still optimistic bec we would have a Suite. But when the Suite was finally available, we were so dissapointed! It was cramped. There were so many corners/walls. The layout was weird. The couch had so much stains on it and it was so gross! I didn't want my kids to sit on it. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls and had bubbles in them. It was very dirty. Bathroom was regular. Nothing special at all. it looked like an ordinary hotel bathroom. Hardly a Suite's bathroom. Bed was like a small queen or a double! There were so much stains on the carpet, and there were even potato chips bits on the floor left by the previous guest!!! GROSS.I really hated the room and dreaded spending time there. It was too bad that I was with a baby and toddler and we had to spend afternoons in the room for their naps. It was also very noisy bec there was construction across the street. On the other hand, the location is the only thing going for this hotel. It's very easy to access mall and good restos nearby. Very convenient that it's near Star Ferry to go to Central, 7-11, Starbucks, Grocery, etc. We had a semi Harbour View. Aside from James at the Front Desk, all the rest of the staff were very nice, helpful and pleasant. Mr. Raymond Lao, the manager, was also very nice and tried to remedy the situation.I'm NEVER staying in this hotel. Not worth the money. We should have stayed in Gateway or maybe in a hotel in Causeway Bay for lesser cost.

<Content>Beware Because of staying in the hotel for one week my travel agency had guaranteed an upgrade to a suite. At checkin they gave me a harbour room without any comment. Never stayed in a suite. So I realized the situation not till the last day. The management told me that my room had the same value than a suite - which is not true. At the end I didn't have to pay for 5 breakfasts. Not at all a real compensation.

<Content>Nice Hotel Stayed here 22nd - 25 Nov 2006. Nice, clean hotel. Spacious room with nice view but may need to get at least 15th floor and above and of course facing the harbour. Connected to a large shopping centre. Very convenient - near to MTR (subway), near the harbour to Hong Kong Island, Near to shopping area ie Nathan Road etc.

<Content>Very pleasently suprised On arrival at 1030 at night it was great to see how big the room was(regular harbour view) how clean it was and how efficiently it was designed. Our first view of out of the window was spectactular even late at night. As the harbour is one of the many interesting places of the city it was wonderful to be able to look at it on awakening and day and night whenever we were in our room. The staff were very pleasent and very helpful especially the housekeeping staff who responded to our requests almost instantly.The location of this hotel is fantastic. Go out the back door and you are at the star ferry terminal. Out the front and you are a short walk to the MTR, Ashley Rd.,Nathan Rd. and go out on the 2nd or 3rd floor and you are in Ocean Terminal and Harbour City.We had very enjoyable holiday ar this hotel.

<Content>Good Hotel Stayed here as part of honeymoon. Hotel is in a good location with a huge amount of shopping on your doorstep. Has the atmosphere of a busy inner city hotel, geared up for the business traveller. However, we found no problems with the hotel during our stay.All in all, a good hotel from where to explore and discover Hong Kong.

<Content>Don't stay here!! This is without doubt one of the worst experiences we have ever had at a supposed world class hotel On arrival we discovered they had somehow cancelled our booking in July although they had confirmed with travel agent in November. We were told to go awayas they were full and we didn't have a reservation. They then demanded that we pay for the night which of course we refused and after much discussion they allowed us to go to a room. 3 adults in a room not much bigger than a closet and only 2 single beds! After we made several phone calls back to Australia and 24 hours later eventually the hotel admitted we did in fact have a reservation and we could stay in the closet sized room for the 15 day stay we had paid for. We of course refused and demanded the room we had paid for and finally had a real sized room although not a harbour view as we were expecting. Their website states the have queen sized beds. They don't they have 2 single beds and if you have 3 people you get a roll out for the 3rd.. The rooms were tardy and dirty and the staff were all rude and grumpy. We had been advised we could move to a harbour view room for the last 5 days which we accepted. It was also dirty and dusty and the air con was broken. We had blasting freezing cold air and it took 2 days to get a heater in the room. The bathroom leaked so every shower flooded the bathroom the toilet leaked and the plugs didn't work in the sink or the bath. They didn't seem to be bothered and not willing to fix anything. We will not be staying here ever again and we would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Some good, Some bad Stayed at MPHK in Sep. 3 ladies on a week of shopping and having fun. Upgraded to a Suite (to give us more room) but should have got a Harbourview room. Suite had outdated furniture and no view. Great position - direct access from hotel into a great shopping centre. Housekeeping ladies were a lot of fun, helpful and very pleasant. Our biggest gripe was with the concierge/porter staff. Every day we came in with our shopping trolleys/carts full to the brim  quite heavy. The staff all stood around  watched us struggle to open the doors, struggle down the couple of steps, trundle thru the foyer  up the next couple fo steps. We only got service when we banged the carts down the steps and made that much noise that everyone, including the check-in guests, turned to see what all the noise was. I think our next trip to HK we will try another hotel - pity as MPHK was strongly recommended.

<Content>Great Hotel Welcome to the most over-airconditioned city in the world. The Marco Polo is no exception either. It's a very beautiful hotel with a great buffet breakfast - very classy. It's so close to the Avenue of Stars and the Ferry. You can access all the major attractions either by subway or by foot. Shopping is also very close to the hotel as the ladies market and the local market are nearby. I went to Bridal Alley and it was a zoo in there but lots of fun. Key points to note:* The rooms have 1 key vs a keycard.* Check in is long* A harbour view is nice but you can get the same view from the  ferry or from Victoria Peak. It's not worth the extra money,  especially since you won't be in your room.* Drop off to your hotel is in the alley beside the hotel. No need  to be alarmed... this is normal as the streets are very busy.* There are 3 Marco Polos so you have to remember to say  Marco Polo Hong Kong if you take a cab or need a pick up for  the airport shuttle.* It's not as hot in HK as the reports say... it was balmy when I  was there.Overall, a great hotel... too bad we didn't stay longer.

<Content>Not convinced about the Marco Polo We stayed at the Marco Polo from 12/9 to 17/9 2006. On check in we were extremely frustrated (especially after travelling such a long distance from the UK) that they had allocated us a twin smoking room. We then entered into a rather protracted and tired conversation to try and obtain a double room (as this is what had been booked and it was our honeymoon!) and a non-smoking room. At one point we were told we would have to wait a further 2-3 hours to check in to get such a room (we arrived at about 4.30pm which was not particularly early) but the reception desk then managed to find us a room. Unfortunately the whole experience tainted the start of our visit as we didn't really feel as if they were trying to help us - if we hadn't had pushed so hard for the room change i doubt we would have got anything out of them. The rooms were spacious (though we ended up with two single beds pushed together with two single duvets!) and well equipped but overall the hotel lacked an ambience. Ok it did everything it was supposed to do, the location is great for the harbour view (make sure you get one of these rooms as it is amazing) and it has great access to the star ferry which takes you into central hong kong. There are also some nice restaurants next door in the shopping centre which offer a great view over the harbour which is great at night. Overall a good hotel but it lacks ambience and character, and, the check in experience left a lot to be desired.

<Content>Perfect! My partner and I have just returned from an amazing 7 night stay at the Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel. What can I say? The hotel was wonderful, staff were helpful and accomodating but not in any way rude or intrusive. We were very aprehensive about staying at this hotel after reading a mixture of reviews on trip advisor but rest assured none of it was true! well not in our case anyway. We were upgraded to a suite on arrival copmplete with dressing room lounge and office, our entire room service bill for the week was under 拢200 which considering the amount of cocktails we drank at the bar and full english breakfasts delivered to our room every day, we felt was pretty reasonable! In fact we enjoyed the Marco Polo so much we have just booked another holiday there next March which we plan to combine with a week in Beijing. Chinas an amazing country and the Marco Polo hong kong hotel was the icing on the cake!

<Content>Great Hotel!Great Locatiion! Priot to travelling we had read a previous travellers review of the hotel and were really apprehensive about our stay. We arrived and were pleasantly surprised and impressed by the hotel and the amenities. We had an executive suite which was spacious with a livingroom ,kitchen, dressing room, large bedroom and spacious bathroom. The location of the hotel was exellent - close to the Star Ferry terminal - a walk through the Gateway Mall- a short distance from the MTR and if you take the elevator to the second floor and get off there for the mall - there is a great coffe shop for superb affordable breakfasts . The room were clean and the bedding and towels changed daily.The reception and concierge staff were friendly and helpful. We used the MTR to get around Hong Kong from visiting the Hong Kong Disney ,Po Lin Monastery , Causeway Bay, Temple Street, Ladies Market and Victoria Peak via the Star Ferry-you name it we did it!!There is a fabulous outdoor Chinese street outdoor eatery at Temple Street Market which is no frills but the food is absolutely magnificent!!!!!!!!!!!!Will we return to Hong Kong and stay at the Marco PoloGateway?The answer has to be yes!!!

<Content>Great location, great service, great experience Just came back after 10 days in Hong Kong - staying at MPHK. We were very nervous after reading some of the negative reviews but all I can think of is Where did these people stay?!! We'd been upgraded to a suite, breakfast included - fantastic because it was a good breakfast in a city where food is expensive! Hotel staff were great, our room was fabulous - we really appreciated the extra room! We had friends staying in a Harbour View room - great view!! Same experience as us - loved the hOtel.There was noise from the building site next door during the day but this didn't worry us - we were out and about. Lovely service, great room, comfortable bed - good value.Also - if you like good food go to the Quarterdeck in Harbour City - seriously yummy food and great service - make a reservation and get a window table. Great experience.Cheers

<Content>Could of been an Excellent Experience The last week of July 2006 we stayed for 6 nights at the Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel in Kowloon. Because I was traveling with my son I wanted to have a room, which was large enough for us to spread out but still reasonable in price. After reviewing several options we choose a one-bedroom suite at the Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel. Our check in was very smooth and upon arriving at our suite found the view of an apartment building and a little bit of the Pool Courtyard. We were warned in advance the suite's did not have much of a view so we new what to expect. What do they say in Real Estate, Location, Location, and Location? This hotel has one of the best locations in Hong Kong. It is located in the core hub of Kowloon right at the Star Ferry terminal. For those of you who need the western comforts don't worry there is a Starbucks, 7-Eleven and a McDonald's in the next building. The hotel is showing it's age but still the rooms were very well kept. Exceptionally clean and pleasantly decorated. The A/C worked very well almost two well. The only reason I did not give this visit an excellent rating occurred when a problem developed in the A/C and was not handled very well by the management. On our second morning when I awoke, I noticed the A/C had leaked overnight onto the desk in the Parlor of the suite. It had ruined a number of documents on the desk and got my digital camera wet. This was a steady drip not just a few drops. The Manager on duty was summoned along with the Chief Engineer and stated they will fix the leak while we were out and if the camera was ruined offered to buy me a new one. Thank goodness the camera was fine, so we went off on our venture and returned around 5:00 PM., to a cleaned up room and an A/C that was not leaking. The third morning I was up early out working on my computer in the parlor when it started to rain on my computer and me. I quickly summoned the Front Office Manager and he said they thought they had fixed the problem but when I started to rain in my room something was very wrong. The FOM stated for the inconvenience they would like to move us up the Club level this afternoon so when we returned from sightseeing please check in at the desk for your new key. He also said that they would move all or luggage and have it in the new suite. We quickly packed up and left our shower stall and went out sightseeing. When we returned around 5:00 PM, we were handed a key for a suite on the third floor. I explained to the Desk Manager that we were told by the FOM that we would be up graded to a suite on the Club Level. She said she did not know anything about that and we would have to take that option. I pressed her to contact the FOM and after 15 minutes of back and forth they finally stated that they did not have a suite on the Club Level but for one night we would have to sleep in a double double. The following day they would move us to a suite up on that floor. We agreed and were taken to a very nice room with a view on the Club Level. The thing that really set me off was after we got settled in, my son and I went down to the lounge for some snacks and a soda, only to be informed in front of everyone in the lounge, that because we were only upgraded to the Club Floor and that we did not pay for the Club Floor therefor, we did not have the privilege of using the Lounge and asked us to leave. I found the actions by Management after we had been inconvenienced and told that we were being upgraded to the Club Floor and then to be embarrassed and thrown out of the lounge like we were second class citizens, to be so out of character for a first class hotel like the Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel. The following afternoon were moved to the same suite we had on a lower floor but this was on the Club Floor without the Club Floor Amenities. That decision by the FOM left such a bad impression on us that the Marco Polo Management team might want to rethink in the future what impact, an egg role and a can of soda would mean to their bottom line. I travel all over the world and I have never been treated like that.

<Content>Great holiday We stopped at the Marco Polo Gateway Hong Kong it was an excellent hotel very good service. Everyone was very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. I would recommend the Marco Polo Gateway not just for the hotel itself but fot the location it was ideal. We were on kowloon side and just had a short walk around the corner to get to the ferry to take us to Hong Kong. We both loved this. Everything we saw and did in Honk Kong was really good. Temple Street market was my favourite for browsing and lots of bargains to be had. We caught the ferry to Lantau Island to see the huge Buddha the weather was awful but just as we were about to leave the skies cleared what a memorable sight. My husband does not eat chinese food but we found the resteraunts cheap and the people more than helpful in explaining the menus. Everywhere was easy to get too we went to Victoria Peak on the Tram this was another fabulous experience, we went late afternoon and then saw all the lights turn on in the harbour. We went for a week along way to go from the U.K but I would recommend it to anyone. A fabulous place.

<Content>Always reliable Just completed a 6 night stay...our 6th trip to Hong Kong in five years, all for leisure visits to our favorite city on the planet. This was our 4th stay at the Marco Polo Hong Kong. This time we booked through Pleasant Holidays and received a free suite upgrade plus daily breakfast for less than we would have paid for a standard room and no breakfast if we'd booked directly through the Marco Polo website.We're very low maintenance travellers and don't require much extra assistance from the staff, but all of our encounters with them were quite pleasant. We're always pleased with the upkeep and condition of the hotel...I've never noticed any of the mustiness that people describe, and the non-smoking floors have never had a hint of smokiness. Perhaps it's the relentless humidity of the city that makes people think the hotel is dank.The breakfast buffet was one of the best we've had. We aren't fancy-shmancy travellers and tend to stay in hotels that typically rate high 3- or 4-stars, and MPHK is one of the best in Asia in that range. And, as others have mentioned, the location is unbeatable!Had to wait a bit for our room to be ready which wasn't any fun after 28+ hours of travelling, but it was still ready well ahead of the official 3 p.m. check-in time. I think the wait was due to the fact that it was a suite and therefor fewer were available to begin with. Management was apologetic for making us wait and offered us a drink at Gripps while we waited.Until we strike it rich and can afford to stay at the Peninsula, MPHK will always be our choice.

<Content>Great Location in Kowloon We stayed 3 nights at the Marco Polo Hong Kong hotel. My first impression of the hotel was that it was a little bit dated and in need of a refurb and not quite as grand as it appeared in the travel brochure. However, our room was very large with a sitting room and a walk in wardrobe and was generally very comfortable. The staff were, for the most part, very accommodating. When I requested a hot water bottle to help relieve an injury, they were quick to bring one and showed genuine concern. The room service meal was delicious  served with great care  flourish. I can also recommend the cocktail bar and the japanese restaurant at the hotel. The only down side to the service was that we returned to our room one afternoon at 3pm to find that it hadn't been serviced yet. This in itself did not concern us overly, but the subsequent phone call from housekeeping insisting (repeatedly) that we vacate the room again to allow it to be cleaned was a little strange. In the end we stood our ground (we were tired and only wanted to relax) but we would have expected to be able to do this without the ensuing argument.But it is the location which makes this hotel special. From the airport we caught the Airport Express train to Kowloon station, and then a free shuttle bus directly to the hotel. The hotel is a short walk to the Star Ferry and to Nathan Road and the excellent MTR subway system. Close to shopping, restaurants and all that Hong Kong has to offer. All in all, I would recommend it.

<Content>Good for the price Stayed at the Marco Polo Hong Kong with my wife and daughter 13/14 June. Had read quite a few reviews on the hotel from trip advisor before asking travel agent to book us in. Never been to Hong Kong before and was using it as a stop over for trip to Australia. Hotel very clean and quite smart, set in the Harbour Plaza shopping mall which is enormous, staff were reasonably friendly and polite but a little bit rigid if you asked for anything outside the box. Had previously emailed them prior to arrival so that extra bed could be put in our room for our 8 year old daughter, this had not been done which was annoying but we decided to upgrade the room to a Harbour View... well worth it extra 800 hong kong dollars for the two nights ( about 拢60) but if you book for 3 nights now you automatically get upgraded. Room spacious bed very comfortable good bathroom and shower but aircon can get a little chilly at night. Overall very good reasonably priced great location and staff ameniable. Gripps american resturant in hotel is good value great for kids staff excellent also Dan Ryans Grill in Plaza Shopping Mall staff superb food very good and priced well. Would go again.

<Content>Disappointing Was in Hongkong last March and we stayed at the Marco Polo Gateway and enjoyed our stay there, there room and bathroom was big and spacious. As we planned our return and decided to stay at the Marcopolo Hongkong we thought it would be much better as we paid more than we did our last stay and those that have stayed there said that it is better. When we got there, the one checking us in wasnt as accomodating and was charging us more for a connecting room which we originally booked. The rooms were much smaller than the ones at Gateway, we got duvet sheets at gateway where as wool blankets and thin worn out sheets at the Hongkong hotel. I just expected that it would be nicer. Next time i would just stay at the Gateway.

<Content>Peculiar Smell.... Here on business + couple of days vacation tacked on, staff are really helpful and friendly and the location is fantastic for shopping and the ferry over to Hong Kong Island. I feel mean saying this but the top floor (17th floor business suites) sure smells peculiar, a musty dampness, maybe dry rot or something, that hits you the second you step out of the elevator. Our room is not too bad but we are as far away from the lobby as you can get. A colleague had to change rooms as they were concerned about getting lung infections, their room you just could not have slept in. Maybe it depends what side of the hotel you are on, when I asked the staff about the smell they said it was from high tea. Yeah, I dont think so! I would request a lower floor if travelling soon, or have it verified that the problem has been fixed.

<Content>i was disappointed! me and my family stayed at marco polo gateway because we were told that it's one of the best in hong kong and so we decided to give it a try. we booked 2 rooms and upon check-in, was given only one room. the reception staff explained that the 2nd room was being cleaned and would be available an hour later. it took them 3 hours to clean the room and they did not even make up for their inefficiency. on our second to the last day, we requested for late checkout and they gave us only until 1pm! we even had to point out that on our first day, we waited 3 hours for the second room, and so they extended until 2pm. the room was clean but it needed renovating. i think the marco polo prince is a newer hotel, and just 2 buildings away.the location was good, but if you're travelling around hong kong through mtr, the walk from the hotel to the station would be around 5-8 minutes and trust me, this is not a short distance especially during peak hours when there are a lot of people rushing off to work/home. this hotel is pretty expensive for the quality of service it provides. choose to stay in other hotels.

<Content>Best hotel i have ever been in - By far I stayed in the Marcopolo Hongkong hotel in October 2005 as part of a 2 week trip to Hong kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. I can honestly say that the marcopolo was one of the serious Highpoints of the trip. We stayed in a harbour view room, but not on the club floor. For the whole stay i couldnt get over the size of the room. It wasnt far off the size of my Apartment. I believe that this is very unusual in Hong kong which is renowned for small rooms. Both the room and the hotel were absolutly spotless and looked like they had been built yesterday. The view from the room is identical to any postcard of the sktline you care to look at and from the roof you can take your own skyline photos. The breakfast is expensive @ E25 for a buffet, but that beat the E17 i paid for a boiled egg in a 5* in paris hands down. The hotel is built over an enourmus shopping center where i spent many hours exploring and its right beside the star ferry terminal and the small shops (mostly mobile phones) of Kowloon.All in all the Hong kong Kowloon is the best hotel i have ever stayed in and im hoping that i Dosent ruin future experiences by comparison.

<Content>A location you can't beat This hotel is unbeatable when it comes to location. It's on the ground floor of a great mall and right in the middle of everything the minute you step out into the street. It's about a 5-10 minute walk to the star ferry (a great and inexpensive way to go to the other side of the harbor) and to the nearest MTR (subway station) on Nathan Road. Though it might not be as posh as the other newer hotels in the block, Marco Polo still have good rooms, clean, spacious, reasonably priced. The personal hotel safe is a big deal for me, it makes me feel secure leaving valuables in the room while I'm out shopping. Lots of good restaurants/holes-in-the-wall around the area.Good breakfast at Maxims across the street . If you take the airport express to Kowloon, a free shuttle will take you to the hotel and back.

<Content>needed an upgrade The good points -- In a very convenient location in Kowloon, very helpful staff. The bad points...The blurb said they had the biggest rooms in Honk Kong but we obviously missed that. Our room was small and smelt musty.I asked to see another romm..no better. In the end I upgraded, at considerable cost, to Continental Club. Apart from the bathroom extractor not working during our 5 day stay it was excellent. The Club has its own lounge ,complimentary breakfast/ afternoon tea (a bit of a bizarre offering but substantial) then Happy Hour and more food.Some guests managed to virtually eat and drink for free!!Plus there was free Internet access.It is possible to actually save on the upgrade if you use all the freebies, but for that money we could have stayed in a much better hotel. The Hotel is undergoing a refurb as it is very dated so I wouldn't recommend it at the moment as you have to use the nearby sister hotel for swimming pool etc.

<Content>Very disappointed We had been at this hotel before and we enjoyed our stay last time. So we booked again for 2 nights in March. However, we do not receive a better service this time. First of all, we were given the smallest size of deluxe room after the staff reported that the hotel were quite full. Eventually, they did change to another bigger room for us after we asked another receptionist who was more polite than the first one. When we asked for an extra blanket and pillows, I never see the housekeeper who was so miserable and rude. My husband actually prepared the tips for her if she would smile a little and friendly enough. What a pity!! The room had a very musty odour and the beds were hard like a rock. I would say this is our last time to stay when you received such a service at the hotel. We did stay other hotels in Hong Kong during our vacation and we did receive a better service.

<Author>Mr. MJB
<Content>Great position, in parts needs updating Viewed recent postings with interest and some trepidation before our trip to Hong Kong.It seems reviewers either hated The Marco Polo or loved it. Have visited HK many times and 4* hotels are generally excellent. Upon arrival at The Marco Polo reception stated we would like to upgrade you to Harbour view room resulting in Breakfast included, duvet instead of blankets and (obviously) a Harbour View. When we accepted gratefully we were told that this would cost HK$300 extra per night. I find this annoying. This is not upgrading, it is quite clearly salesmanship.We declined and were alloted two rooms ( we were a party of two married couples) on the 15th Floor. When asked if these were affected by noise of building works she feigned ignorance of any such noise.As previously reported the rooms did smell a little musty but we did not find it too offensive and the hotel was clearly aware as there was evidence every day of liberal use of room sprays being used. Yes such a smell could be avoided but it was the rainy season in a sub tropical location. The room was large, well furnished and comfortable. The bathroom was in need of refurbishment. Everything worked well in the bathroom with excellent shower not subject to varying temperatures that can be found and it was generally clean but grouting and silicone sealant was discoloured in wet areas, including the floor. Linen and towels were changed daily and were fresh and clean but showing signs of age. Location superb and staff, with only one or two exceptions, charming and helpful. The noise from the building site adjacent was evident throughout our stay. It was not however intrusive except on one occasion when it started at 5am. Residents allocated rooms on lower floors could have been disappointed with noise levels. Overall we were content, our friends had never been to the Far East and there was much for us to show them in Hong Kong. We did not therefore spend much time in the hotel and its location was a big bonus for us.A point of interest to tourists:- The Jumbo Restaurant is a delight for new visitors to Hong Kong. The food can be bettered in many other Chinese restaurants but the overall experience of The Jumbo must be enjoyed at least once. We did therefore ask the Concierge to book a table for us so that our friends could enjoy this treat. We were very disappointed. The Jumbo has changed so that it is now managed by more than one business. The one that we were booked with put us in a small side room with no atmosphere, no chinese decoration,freezing air conditioning and staff who couldn't care less.One appetizer did not appear until 20 mins after we had finished our main courses.When we had pointed out earlier that we had not had this one starter, they insisted that we had but later delivered it with no apology just  here is your missing appetizer which by that time was stone cold and congealed - it was pork! It was even included on the bill until we asked for it to be removed. When we wished to order desserts after waiting 30mins or so to do so, we were told that those that we had chosen which had a chinese flavour would take 30 to 50mins to prepare. We settled for such as creme brulee and mousse,which were pleasant but not a chinese experience. SO be advised if booking the Jumbo make certain that you are booking the upper floor restaurant which is run by the people who operate the excellent restaurant at The Peak This is atmospheric and efficient.

<Content>Spectacular view @ the Marco Polo Hong Kong Recently stayed at this hotel for a family vacation. The lobby was nice and was a great introduction to the hotel. Upon check-in we were offered a room upgrade which included 2 free adult breakfasts which we readily accepted. We were given a room on the 9th floor which provided a gorgeous view of the harbor as well as the skyline. The staff was very friendly and even turned down our bed while we were out. Overall a nice experience and would stay there again. On another note, this hotel was recommended to us as a family hotel, but we did not see anything that made this particular hotel geared toward families.The only downer of our stay was the pool area. It wasn't very large, so lounging by the pool did not seem practical. However, if you're in Hong Kong to lounge by a hotel pool, you are totally missing out on the beauty of Hong Kong.

<Content>Good Location, Good Prices Overall, I enjoyed my stay the Marco Polo. As many reviewers have already stated the location is terrific. It is central to all of Kowloons shopping and sights, with easy access to the star ferry, and a bus to Stanley that stops right outside. The lobby and common areas have been renovated and everything looks fresh and upbeat. I was given a room on the 14th floor. I believe it was one of the larger deluxe rooms, though I had booked a superior room. It certainly was large enough and didn't smell too musty (a common problem in Hong Kong). It was feeezing though, even after I turned off the A/C and turned up the room temp. Brrr. There is really no view from this property at all so don't expect much. The concierge and staff were polite and helpful; breakfast was decent. If you can get a good rate here, I would give it a try, it is tons less $$ than the Sheraton and other Tsim Sha Tsui hotels, and it is certainly a pleasant stay.

<Author>London-Phil
<Content>The Good, The Bad  I will try and be as constructive as possible regarding this review but obviously, these are my personal views and are therefore by nature, slightly biased...Slightly!The Good.The Location, as everyone else has mentioned, is excellent. Close to the Peninsular, Sheraton and minutes from the MTR  Star Ferry. The staff of the Hotel also deserve a mention. Timothy, the Duty Manager tried hard to accommodate my wishes and the Ladies who manned the Continental Club Reception all remembered my name from day one, a nice touch which was appreciated! The Pool was perfectly adequate as was the Gym, although it has to be said that the main centre piece of equiptmant was broken but it all looked new'ish, so we will gloss over that bit. The Club floors were very quiet and the supplied breakfast sufficient as was the Cocktail hour including buffet, from 18:00 to 20:30, pretty generous I thought. The Bad.The rooms. I saw four rooms and ended up in two. I started in a Deluxe room on the 12th floor which was freezing. In fact it was so cold, a brought in heater was needed just to be able to sleep the first night, I was not a happy bunny! I was informed the following morning that the Thermostatic control on the wall was for cosmetic purposes only, as the tempreture was controlled centrally and NO ROOM within the Hotel had any ability to change the tempreture as the Guest might wish...I was further told by Timothy, that he was unaware of any Hotel in Hong Kong having this basic facility. After a while, I stopped laughing and gathered myself up from the floor. Hmmm! First room we saw was a superior suite which had a damp musty smell, almost as if it had been flooded at some point and had not dried completely, needless to say, unacceptable! Next, a very large Deluxe Suite which had a nice view of the Harbour but also suffered from the same type of smell. Finally, room 1731 on the club floor which had no view but was quiet and smelt normal, like a hotel room should. No old musty twang, just normal! These are really quite serious claims to make but, in my view these rooms were simply uninhabitable regardless of price, full stop! I was happy with 1731 and so we move paying the increased nightly rate accordingly. Ah, you get nothing for nothing!The Business Centre. This oasis of resources resides on the 17th floor which serves only the Club Floor guests, about 100 room's I was told. We have; 1 internet terminal serving two floors, Huh? 1 hour's use allowed per day, Huh?? The door locked to the internet room so access denied anyway unless you ask a member of staff, Huh??? No drinks allowed in the room, not even a coffee...Huh???? I'm 42 and responsible (ish), honest! The Cocktail hour's. Why was the wine/Spirits not out, freely available as with the Shangri-La's Horizon Club? Why did I have to ask for EVERTHING? I was never refused but it did kinda make me feel slightly naughty for asking...The Ugly.The front. This has to be the most unattractive entrance I have ever seen! THe MPHG Hotel is supposed to be the flagship Hotel of the chain, Yeah right! The Gateway  The Prince both look like Hotels from the street, the MPHK looks like a Shopping Centre and a tacky one at that! And where is the Lobby? I searched high low for the missing Lobby, but no, gone, somewhere, someplace, sometime! This was not what I had expected. Overall. The MPHK Hotel is not a bad hotel but you can do a great deal better for the money. The Sheraton looked nice from the lobby, The Pen looked a bit like a convention centre and The Langham Hotel charged the same for the Club floor but managed to look like a fairly classy Hotel which is afterall, part of the package your buying into when you stay at such an establisment. It is unlikely I will revisit Hong Kong so the question of staying at the MPHG Hotel again does not really arise, but...If I did, then I would not. You can do better!Regards Phil.

<Content>Excellent hotel I stayed here in late February for four nights. I booked the least expensive room online, and at check-in asked if they could upgrade, and was given a harbor view room on a high floor. The room was very large, which is not too common in Hong Kong, with plenty of space for luggage and a good desk for working, with high-speed internet cable on the desk (costs about $15/24 hours). The room was very clean and quiet, even though I see construction below. Staff very responsive and professional. The location is excellent, with 3 shopping malls connected to the hotel, and a 5 minute walk to Nathan Road shopping. The subway is a 5 minute walk. The Star ferry to HK Island is next door. The gym is small but decent and there is a nice pool area. The breakfast buffet in the cafe is ok, but a bit pricey, but I actually prefer the Starbucks around the corner. There are literally hundreds of restaurants within a 5 minute walk.

<Content>A true bargain This was the most fantastic end to our Oceania cruise (Singapore to Hong Kong). We,re a party of 4 ladies celebrating 2 birthdays, we stayed 3 nights at the Continental floor of this hotel that I warmly reccommend. The Harbour view room was big and comfy (maybe the bathroom was a bit oldfashioned, but I adored the duck in the tub)and the view was unforgettable ; concierge and employees most attentives, and the Continental lounge (full breakfast, tea and soup, drinks and hors-d,oeuvres)was more than enough so we could spend all our time shopping in the mall just some floors below...the Star Ferry to the Island is 2 steps away and a lovely shop (Chinese Arts and Crafts) is round the corner. We got a fair rate for our fantastic room (1900HK$ plus tax) and they allowed a superlate checkout (19.00pm) which is a plus, as most planes back West leave at midnight.

<Content>Good location but beware building site right next door! Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in January, as previously stated in other reviews, the position is excellent. Right next door to the star ferry terminal. and fabulous shoppping centres and markets nearby. However at the back of the hotel is a huge building site which starts at 6am with diggers and other loud machinery. The site looks like it will be going on for some time, it appears to be another hotel being built. It may be that if you had a room facing the front of the hotel you wouldnt get the noise from the building site, but it is on a very busy main road. The rooms although spacious do smell fusty. Even though the location is good, personally I'd give this one a miss, there are plenty of hotels in Hong Kong!

<Content>Loved the position, but .. ... not the hotel. We stayed at the Marco Polo Hong Kong in a superior triple room share for 17 days in January 2006. On the positive side the position of the hotel is outstanding. It is right next to Star Ferry, surrounded by a huge range of designer shops and connected to Ocean Terminal (one of the largest shopping malls in Hong Kong). From the Ocean Terminal you have access to Gateway Arcade another amazing huge shopping complex. It is just a 5 minute walk to the MTR station (Tsim Sha Tsui) and Nathan Road. Unfortunately, I have to say that in all other respects it really wasn't that great. The rooms are tired and shabby looking and smelt like a mix of musty dankness and furniture polish. The lampshades, pictures, refreshment tray  mini bar place mats were very dusty and dirty and the overall room cleanliness was not good. I don't think the room was vacuumed properly once in 17 days. The room was cold and the air-conditioning ineffective taking hours to warm up slightly. The water-hammer was so loud we thought people were slamming or banging on doors until we worked out what it was. The supplies were stingy - one small soap for three people - we had to call housekeeping to supply more. The staff were polite but not friendly. The food was mostly ordinary, served luke warm and expensive although the lobby lounge set menu deal was good value and the staff there were noticeably more friendly and attentive. The wait for a lift can be quite long - bring a book. It is not a place I'd recommend to the fastidious - although if you get a really good rate (which we did) and don't plan to spend much time there the position alone might be worth the other problems. It has the potential to be a really good hotel - it just falls short on the details. I notice the people who have written good reviews were in harbour view rooms and suites so it sounds like it is worth paying more to upgrade if you do stay there.

<Content>Needs a Refurbishment I am a regular visitor to HK- approximately 3x per year - and on this trip I stayed at the Marco Polo Gateway. The Gateway is one of three Marco Polo Hotels located on Canton Road. The location is great but the hotel is desperately in need of a refurbishment. I stayed for 6 nights on business and had to ask for a room change as the one allocated 鈥?9th floor- had a bathroom too run down and old to be hygienic . I was moved to a 13th floor room which was slightly better. There is no Pool or Gym in this hotel so you have to walk to the Hong Kong Hotel if you want to use these facilities.Hotel staff are very obliging as in all the Marco Polo Hotels. I would normally stay at the Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel which has been under renovation for the last few years. Only marginally more expensive but much nicer rooms and right next to the Star Ferry.

<Content>Very Good Hotel I stayed at the Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel Jan 10-13.It was my fourth visit and the first time in a Deluxe Ocean View Continental Club room ( I have always stayed in a suite there on previous visits ). The room was large with a fantastic harbour view from the 18th floor. The service is very good on the club floors. The included breakfast and evening soup and snacks a real treat.Pricey, but not like the similar 4 stars on the HK side. Look for deals.

<Content>fantastic location We stayed in this hotel in December for three nights, as a stop off on our way to Australia. We loved the location of it, right bang in the centre of Kowloon, and a two minute walk to the Star ferry.Our room was fine, large enough with two double beds, and really clean. We were initially offered an upgrade, but when the girl on the desk checked it out it was unavailable for the three nights, which was very disapointing. I think it is time for the hotel to modernise the bedrooms as when you arrive the reception is very grand which leads you to expect more from the rooms, but all in all we enjoyed our stay here and would return.

<Content>Great at the Top Having stayed at the Marco Polo Gateway ( I am member of the Tai Pan Club) many times, it is evident that unless you book at the Continental Club on the very upper levels of the hotel you can end up with less than satisfactory service, as well as less than good value for money. Hong Kong is very price competitive, with some of the finest hotels in the world, so it is not difficult to ensure that you get a good deal through negotitation. On the Continental floor one gets all sort of extra priveleges, although it does cost considerably more. The FREE break fast ; drinks and snacks is well worth the extra cost.When booking by the internet one does not always get the best rate, last time I stayed at the Marco Polo Prince it was only aftter speaking to another guest, who had booked via an agent, that I found there were specials on. I asked for a refund  no such luck but I did get a reduced rate for the remainder of my stay.I have always found the staff friendly and efficient as well as prepared to go that  extra mileThere can be no doubt that the hotel is superbly positioned for both the seasoned business traveller as well as the holiday maker who wants to visit all of Hong Kongs excellent tourist attractions

<Content>Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel, Good Hotel We booked a room for 2 nights using the hotel's website. It was priced HKD1,400 per nite for a harbour view room. We stayed on the 14th Floor.The harbour view room turned out to be blocked by YMCA, the space theater and the Hong Kong cultural center with only a small opening to see the harbour. It was probably a harbour view when they first constructed the hotel, but now its been blocked by newer buildings. Not worth the extra.I went up to the 17th Floor Continental Club Floor to see if its any better (Harbour view cost HKD1900) and found out it faced simiar problems. So beware when booking the harbour view rooms. Don't get fooled to pay extra.There was construction next to the hotel and the piling works start around 8am, so if you are a light sleeper, ask for a room that does not face the construction site.The hotel room as big, clean and very comfortable. They had very very nice sheets and they gave down comforters and pillows. The room had its own walk in closert and a seperate wash basin area and bath/toilet.The internet was expensive, at HKD140 per day.The location is very good, very short walk to star ferry, MTR and also the ferries to macau.I also used the gym (very basic, 3 threadmills, 2 bikes, a stair climber, weights and a weights machine). They gave free green apples. The pool is heater and is not very big.All in all a very pleasant stay.

<Content>Not all we had hoped for We stayed here in December 05 at the end of a long holiday in NZ. This was a stopover on the way home and we had booked here on the recommendation in a holiday brochure that stated this was 4 star plus.Whislt the foyer is very nice and it is on the Canton Road which is a good location, the foyer had a terrible smell of bad drains, which was off putting. This is meant to be the flag ship hotel of the three Marco Polo Hotels on this road, but I was a bit disappointed.Whilst rooms are small in Hong Kong, the room did not smell very fresh, and the bathroom was tiny, which considering there was a walk in wardrobe next to it seemd to be a waste of useful space. The bathroom was a bit jaded and needed refurbishing. This was a disappointment as we had booked a deluxe room. They were offering upgrades for three nights for around 拢45.00 including breakfast and we should have taken this up, in hindsight.Threfore a word of caution, deluxe doesn't necessarily mean deluxe so check the room first.

<Content>Disappointed We stayed here early in December and I expected better than it was. The Hotel room was average with a pretty dull view at a building site across the road. The room was very cold even with the air conditioning turned to maximum. The heaters in the air conditioning unit did not appear to be working and after 2 days of being frozen I was given an oil filled radiator after complaining. The staff were pleasant enough, but not friendly. The room was very noisy due to the traffic in the busy street below and the building site across the road, but the windows are only single glazed- I think Double glazing would have kept the noise down. Service was not excellent we left our room one morning at 08:00 and left the tag asking for the room to be made up and it was still not done at 5pm. Housekeeping then phoned me to ask if they could service the room but could not tell me why it was not serviced during the day while we were out. I would definitely not stay here again in the future - for the prices the Hotel charge I expected much better.

<Content>Dated and in need of a refurb - but great location! I usually stay at the excellent Langham Place when I work in Hong Kong, but it was full and the only hotel I could find with availability was this one. The lobby area was fine, but the rooms were very shabby  dated and the hotel needs to be remodelled. Depite the dated styling, I did find the design of the room quite practical - I could store my travel bag at waist height (instead of having to bend to get into it) and there was plenty of cupboard space. Internet connection in the room was fine. Minibar was not very well stocked - but if you go into the adjacent shopping mall (the hotel is in the same building) and to the top floor there is an excellent supermarket (follow signs for CitySuper), with large choice of international food and snacks. Special mention goes to the 'institutional' bathroom, like something out of death row, but again if you look past the dated styling, everything worked ok. I know that some say the tiles were grotty - I'd say the grouting is just old as opposed to dirty! I travelled to this hotel with a Scottish Colleague who found it hilarious that the Scottish Themed Tartan Bar only had two choices of whisky - both of them very bog- standard! Gave us a laugh anyway!

<Content>Marco Polo Hong Kong --Fantastic We stayed at the Marco Polo for 7 nights We had two Harbour rooms on the 16th Floor. Just the best view of HK. The hotel is old but the rooms were in fantastic condition Our room was smallish but still comfortable Our Adult daughters did much better their room adjoining ours was huge even by Aussie standards complete with lounge area and huge walk in robeOur bed was great theirs hard. The breakfast is superb at HK$180 less a 20% in house discount which meant it was about A$22 Bargain!!!The location is great virtually on top of the Star Ferry and shoping centreThe staff were great and nothing was a problemWe paid about A$170 per room per night and this was a bargainOnly one complaint there always seem to be a lift not working which meant a wait but this is just minor compared to the total experienceIam really fussy and was very nervous about staying here but we loved it it. Cant wait to return

<Content>Drab, dreary and smelled of mildew Rooms were drab, dreary and constantly smelled of mildew. Location was ok but Central district may have been a better place to stay. Definetly would NOT stay there nor recommend anyone from staying there. For the money and the experience, ANYTHING else would have been better.

<Content>Great place to stay We stayed in the Marco Polo for just 2 nights, and couldn't really fault it.The Hotel is located right next to the Star Ferry, which is great for crossing over to Hong Kong Island, and very close to Nathan Road which is the main road through Kowloon.From the moment you walk in, you are hit by the style of the place - the entrance lobby is very minimalist with lots of glass and black marble(?). The Reception staff were very courteous, and I had heard that upgrading to a room on the Continental Floor would be worthwhile - so we asked about this and paid approx 拢100 extra for the 2 nights.This upgrade provided us with what I believe was a bigger room, but we were very disappointed that there was no view of the harbour (all we could see was a white-washed wall and a distant view of the pool) - I would definitely recommend that before agreeing to upgrade you check out the room on offer, and if able to pay the extra for a harbour view (the view is incredible). We called Reception to try to change rooms, and they tried really hard to help but there were no other rooms available. The room was large, very clean, had everything you could need (robes, safe, tea/coffee, DVD player)and was well serviced. Word of warning - the mattress is like lying on a block of bricks, but is surprisingly comfortable.The Upgrade also allowed use of the Guest Lounge, where depending upon the time of day has different things on offer free of charge. Buffet breakfast was very nice; between noon and 6pm ish there are snacks which would be ample for a lunch; there is an hour of free cocktails and then afternoon-tea served later on in the day. Tea and Coffee are available throughout the day.Would we go back there?? If our budget was limited, then definitely so - however, the Peninsula would be our first choice, as when we ate there at the Felix Restaurant, we were blown away by the hotel (check out the toilets on the top floor - they are the best in the world).

<Content>Great location, great hotel Set in the heart of bustling TST, right next to Star Ferry, this place is well located and well appointed.Rooms are pretty big, with separate pantry i.e. large closet with tea and coffee, fridge etc. Everything is spotlessly clean, albeit not particularly lavish.Service is impeccable and there is a nice gym and outdoor pool that seems remarkable under-used.Good choice.

<Content>Can't Fault this Hotel Great location with direct access to a fantastic shopping mall, easy walk to the Star Ferry and Nathan Rd in Kowloon, easy walk to both the metro and the KCR urban rail.Checked in by efficient friendly staff who upgraded me to an executive room, brilliant harbour view from an oversized room with a great bathroom; seperate bath and shower.Seems the coffee and tea supplies were replenished twice a day.Bed was very comfortable and linen was nice and crisp and clean.Overall you can't go wrong if you book the Marco Polo Hong Kong, pay a bit extra and get yourself a harbour view room, you can lay in bed of a night and watch the lights of Hong Kong Island, or sit by the window during the day and watch one of the worlds greatest harbours.Hong Kong is renowned for very small hotel rooms, the MP Hong Kong kills that myth.Highy Recommended. Will definatley return.

<Content>average hotel... but great location. Ive stayed at Marco Polo prince 2 years ago...and i can say that this hotel is better than the Prince. (but not really by much..) Very average rooms, and it is located between the other two marco polos. I assume Marco Polo Hong Kong is the best among the three. If you dont mind the average rooms, the location makes up for it...connected right smack in the middle of the largest shopping mall in kowloon...its very convenient to just stroll around...and also very close to the star ferry. Will try other hotels next time...

<Content>excellent hotel Really good value for HK. I have stayed in Metropark and New World renaissance hotel before. Of the three, Marco Polo HK is the best. Really big rooms, great location, convenient for food ( lots of good restaurants in the Mall as well as on Canton road right cross the street), shopping and traveling. We have a small baby, so convenience is a must. Service is nice. The only negative thing I have is the location of Airport Express bus stop not being right at the hotel.

<Content>Great Stay We had a fantastic stay at this hotel on our honeymoon. The staff were friendly, the rooms, were modern, clean and near luxurious. The view from our room was stunning 鈥?out over the busy harbour and over to HK island. The view alone really made our stay all the more special. We only stayed here for four nights but loved every minute of it. The hotel鈥檚 location is perfect 鈥?better than the Peninsula or any of the other major hotels in HK. The Marco Polo is literally on the doorstep of the Star Ferry terminal - giving quick and easy access to HK Island. The only thing we had to gripe about (and it is minor) was that when we arrived, we were told our room wasn鈥檛 ready and we鈥檇 have to wait an hour or so. But given the turnover of guests at the hotel (NB the average stay in HK is four days!), this was forgivable. The buffet breakfast was great too. All-in-all a superb experience.

<Content>Average Hotel, But Great Location The room was on a larger side by Hong Kong standard. However, most items are old - from the front door to the wardrobe and to the sink in the bathroom. I do not think the hotel had renovated or refurbished its rooms since the mid 80s. For the rate I paid, I expected something more modern. That said, the room was clean enough and could be a comfortable stay if one did not mind the 80s-style decor. Importantly, it is conveniently located within the largest shopping complex in Hong Kong - the Harbour City.

<Content>Best of The three I have stayed in the Marco Polo Prince, Gateway and Hong Kong and have to say that the Hong Kong is definitely the best. The bar/restaurant area is very pleasant, far more so than the pokey bar at the gateway and quieter than the prince. The rooms were much larger and better appointed than in the other two and the service from all was far better.To give them ratings, I would say the Prince 4/10, the Gateway 6/10 and the Hong Kong 8/10

<Content>Harbour-view room was superb We loved it, partly because we paid a little extra for a harbour-view room and got a superb suite. It was very spacious and had every amenity including slippers and a rubber-duck. No noise whatsoever from adjacent rooms or the corridor.Breakfast wasn't included, but was well worth paying for each day. Staff were very attentive at breakfast and the one one time we had dinner there was our best meal of the trip. Couldn't fault the staff either. Overall this felt like a 5-star hotel, the only exception being the entrance which is right on the permanently-jammed Canton Road. But the doorman was smart and helpful.Perfect location, just seconds away from the Star Ferry, on top of Harbour City shopping complex and 5 minutes from Tsim Sha Tsui MTR and Nathan Road shops.

<Content>Authentic Hong Kong hotel Really enjoyed this hotel. Fantastic location, extra large rooms, great buffet breakfast. The service was fantastic, real attention to detail. Sitting in the bar over a drink I bearly spilt a drop when the barman hurried over and refilled my glass for free. My husband was given his 2nd beer at no cost to boot!The hotel was recommended to us through Qantas Airlines who were running a airfare/accom deal that was brilliant (accomodation was basically at 1/3 of what one might expect to pay) and on top of that there was a 20% discount on all food and beverage consummed in the hotel. At no time did we have to remind the hotel that we had booked a non smoking room or that we were due a discount on food etc. Everything was done with a smile. I think this hotel has a lovely feel of 'real' Hong Kong and not that non descript international feel so common in many hotels today.

<Content>Great Gateway ! We stayed at the Marco Polo Gateway in September 2004 - and I've been dying to go back to Hong Kong ever since. There had been a mix up with our travel agent and the tour operator - they told us on arrival we had been moved to another hotel - we said we would prefer to stay at the Gateway if possible (we didn't realise that the alternative hotel was only about five doors away). Anyway - it took a good couple of hours to sort out - but we did get a room in the Gateway - and the lady on reception (Kimi) could not do enough to either help - or apologise. She was very good with us - when we finally got a room - we had an upgrade - very spacious - and they also left a bottle of wine in our rooms for us to make up for the confusion - even though it wasn't really the hotels fault. The location was excellent - first time in HK and had no idea as to where would be a good base - we really dropped on here. Just round the corner from the Star Ferry - close to Nathen Road for the shopping too. There was a public holiday - 1st Oct I think - firework display over the harbour - stunning. Enjoyed everything about Hong Kong - and hope that anyone else reading the review has as good a time as we did!

<Content>Excellent for a 4 star hotel This must be the best 4 star hotel we've ever stayed in. Stayed 4 nights on way back from Australia and when we checked in were offered a deal to upgrade to a Continental Club room for around 拢35.00 a night. This gave the two of us breakfast each day, afternoon tea, cocktails for 3 hours each evening and one hour's free internet access. We had our own floor where all this was situated. Food was great and you could make the afternoon tea into a late lunch as they had soup as well as cakes/scones etc. With evening drinks they provided hot nibbles and food and I'm sure some people were using this as their main meal. Fresh fruit and tea/coffee was available all day. Our suite was superb - very nice furnishings and excellent service. The only downside was if you wanted to use a pool you had to walk 5 minutes to their sister hotel. Location was good as shopping mall adjacent and only a few minutes walk to Star Ferry. Would recommend - especially if you get chance to upgrade.

<Content>It's OKAY This hotel was clean, service was OK, great location. Our included breakfast was less than great. If you've got a great deal, feel safe... it's clean, close, etc...

<Content>Great hotel, good location We stayed at this hotel Nov '04 as a stopover on route from Australia. On arrival we were upgraded to to the Continental Club free of charge. The room was wonderful and very spacious, the bathroom was large and luxurious. The furniture was very good quality and the beds were just heaven. The view from our room was amazing, we looked over Hong Kong harbour.The staff were extremely friendly and efficient. We were given a voucher when we arrived for a free cocktail in the bar (a very nice touch).Breakfast was really good. Excellent choice of chinese and continental food to choose from.I could not fault this hotel in anyway. Good location, good food, excellent service and fab rooms.

<Content>Overpriced but good location We were very disappointed when we first saw our room, as we were paying a lot of money to stay here. On arrival we were told we had been upgraded from our original Room. (hate to see what room we would have had!) everything looked worn out. and the room was the size of a postage stamp. The view was not very good either, looking onto a neighbouring dingy tower block. The room was not reminiscent of the website at all!A strong complaint to the Manager got us a room that had just been renovated and this was much better (view still quite bad though). Saying that we had a good time as the location was really good and once you could speak to the staff they were very helpful.
