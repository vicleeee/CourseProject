<Content>Avoid street-facing room (esp. Room #114) My husband and I stayed at this hotel in early January, and while I agree with other reviewers that the location is ideal and the accommodations are generally clean, if basic, street noise almost ruined our stay.Our first night, we were put in Room #114, which overlooks the street below. My husband and I are both heavy sleepers and did not think twice about street noise being an issue. That is, not until midnight when the crowds on the street started to get rowdy. Then, a septic truck parked right outside our window and proceeded to empty the septic/sewer, filling our room with an unpleasant stink. Then there were the garbage trucks. And the street sweepers. And then in the morning, a truck that I can only assume was a glass recycling truck emptying an unbelievable number of glass filled dumpsters. It was the worst night of sleep of my life.While the front desk staff did move us to a different room, further from the street, they did so without apology or any hint of regret for our long, sleepless night. It was far from the level of customer service I would have expected, and I don't know that I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great location, basic Location fantastic, could not be more central but as Florence has lots of churches with bells ringing at very early hours (ie, 6am), depending where in the hotel your room is, you may be awake very early! We had expected continental breakfast but to be honest, in my view it wasn't a continental breakfast, really just muesli, white bread rolls and juice from a machine. No cheeses, cold meats, fruit, pastries, etc. Actually, very nice coffee and hot chocolate though! Would stay here again as value for money, clean and location fab, and you may aswell go down for coffee at breakfast as the church bells have wakened you anyhow! :)

<Content>Place to go again We stayed in this hotel in august and were very satisfied. The quality of services was decent , breakfast good and staff polite. The absolutly best about the hotel is its location. Itéº“s in the very historic centre very close to every important place of interest. You can hit each direction and reach some notable monument. We can recommend it.

<Content>Nice Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Albergo Firenze for 2 nights in mid-June. We took the train up from Rome (about a 90-minute ride) at 6:30 a.m. because we had a Tuscan Cooking tour scheduled for 9:00a.m. We got to the train station and headed in the direction of the hotel. It was about a 15 minute walk, but the town was lovely, coblestone streets, little side roads, well-dressed people....great first impression. We walked right past Duomo, which is massive, then our hotel was right around the corner. We went inside and there was a group of about 15-20 just leaving. Obviously our room was not ready yet, but they had luggage storage and restrooms. Also, breakfast was being served, which is included (not for us since we hadn't officially checked in yet). They had water and soda for sale for a decent price in the lobby so we got a couple for the day.Our tour was with Verbena Blu Travel and it was a Cooking in Chianti tour. We had a van/guide that took us about an hour away to the Tuscan countryside. Then we went to a little restuarant for our cooking class. Usually there are groups of 6-8, but we were the only 2 on this day so it was quite ideal. We made traditional Tuscan food---tomato soup, druken pork, biscottini (once baked biscotti). Then we had a wine and olive oil lesson---fabulous! After we cooked, ate, and drank wine we went to the medival village of San Gimignano and walked around for a bit. Then we were so exhausted we headed back to the hotel.We got back to the hotel around 5:30, checked in, and found our room. It was fine for what we needed. There were tile floors, generic furniture, but a nice big bathroom. We slept great, breakfast the next day was included and we ate quick because we had reservations at Accademia to see David. The rest of the day was spent walking around and looking at the sights. We ended the day at Plaza Michaelangelo overlooking the city, it was quite lovely. And, everything was within walking distance from the hotel. We even squeezed in a train trip out to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa for a couple of hours. Overall, a great trip, a great city, and a great hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Location We stayed at this hotel in mid June with friends. The location was ideal for everything. Just opposite the hotel was a church which had three concerts in our nine night stay and was very enjoyable. The staff were very friendly and told us about different things that was happening in the city which we found very helpful. The room was very clean, and the beds were very comfortable, we were on the fourth floor and did not find it to be too noisy. I certainly would go back to this hotel if returning to Florence which we hope to do.

<Content>A great find in Flroence and a great location My husband and I loved the Albergo Firenze. The room was large and airy and very well kept. The staff was friendly and warm and very helpful. The location could not be beat and we found some incredible restaurants nearby (travellers looking for a great lunch deal: Trattoria Anita fixed lunch of 7 Euros for 2 courses could not be beat). The breakfast, while not a feast, was a welcome change to sit and enjoy morning coffee and brioche. A wonderful find in a beautiful and welcoming city!

<Content>Great location and reasonable rates We were well pleased with Albergo Firenze. The location was excellent, the rooms clean, and the staff courteous and helpful. The bathroom was quite large. The breakfast was fine. I would rate it the best bargain we found in Italy. My only complaint, and it happened elsewhere in Italy, was that the A/C cuts off in the middle of the night, no matter how warm.

<Content>Spartan/Drama The hotel is perfectly clean and is in a very, very convenient location. That said, it was also rather spartan. Linoleum everywhere -- not a rug in sight. The bathroom towels were thin and in short supply. There was a handwritten sign on a cabinet outside our room asking guests not to take extra towels from the cabinet.But the noise was unbelievable! Sharing a courtyard with other buildings, the hotel gets to also share the life-styles of the inhabitants of the other buildings. Ear-splitting rap music aside, we were also the unwilling witnesses to an unbelievably dramatic marital battle which took place in the courtyard, and went on for at least an hour. That was all during the day. At night, any noise made on your hotel floor was loud enough to wake you up. We would not stay there again, although, as I said, it was certainly clean (no rugs to vacuum!), and very conveniently located.

<Content>Overpriced, overrated All the travel advice you ever read warns you not to turn up in Florence without booking a hotel in advance. I should have listened. I've been there many times and remembered walking by Albergo Firenze and thinking that it looked like a rather nice little place, so when I changed my plans at the last minute I decided to turn up unannounced and see if they could fit me in.The problem is that it promises much but doesn't deliver. The lobby is lovely and the staff are friendly and helpful. They had one room left - a large triple, which they readily agreed to give me, a solo traveller, at what they called a reduced rate. Which seemed reasonable until I got upstairs. For 103 Euros I got a depressing room with broken youth hostel furniture, dirt around the edge of the bath, ludicrously soft foam mattresses and threadbare linens. There's little or no soundproofing so you hear everything from the hall, even late night arrivals who are clearly trying to tiptoe in.Florence is an outrageously expensive city and for your money you'll probably get less here than anywhere else in Italy. But even in overpriced Venice the same amount at Ca dei Dogi got me a gorgeous room. I don't mind simple budget hotels with plastic furniture and no frills, and I've stayed in many around Europe. But they tend to charge 60-70 Euros a night tops, even in the most expensive cities like Paris or Barcelona. This place certainly shouldn't be charging more than that. Next time I'm in Florence I'll go back to one of my old, cheaper favourites and save my money for the food and wine. And the shopping....

<Content>Worse Than Terrible! Do Not Stay Here! We were a family of 8 traveling together and spending a full week at this hotel. We reserved 4 rooms. Upon arrival only 3 available rooms. They refused to work with us or speak to travel agent. Even worse the air conditioning in the hotel did not work and the staff refused to provide fan's in any of the 3 rooms. Even after the air conditioning was fixed it still did not work in our room and the staff pretty much called us liar's before they would send someone up to look at the unit. The staff was not helpful and quite rude the entire time. Wait that is not the worst of it. Upon our return we noticed they charged us $1500 too much. The way the work the books! It is 4 months later and to date we have only been refunded $200 of the $1500 over charge. I am still working with my bank to get the remainder of the money. The staff is rude and not helpful. I would never recommend this hotel. Even though the location is good it is not worth 2 times what they claim they charge. Watch your credit card charges or better yet if you insist on staying there pay cash and don't give them a card. Otherwise you may be sorry!! I cannot recommend this hotel under any circumstances. DO NOT STAY at the ALBERGO FIRENZE FLORENCE it is the worst hotel experience I have ever had.

<Content>Location good - accomodation bad Just returned from a four night stay here. It was a last-minute decision to take the trip  so some preferred hotels were not available. I was travelling with my father who is 79  has bad knees so it was important to have a lift in the hotel  to be in a central location.First thing I noticed was that there is a smell to the hotel, particularly in the reception area. As they didn't have any double rooms left I booked a triple which was 138 euros per night. It was a large clean room but bleak, like a hostel dormitary. The strangest thing was the towels, they appeared to have been made from old sheets or tablecloths. They were clean  were changed every day but I've never been given towels like them anywhere else.I liked hearing the morning church bells (about 7.30am), other noises were not so welcome. The corridors do echo  room doors do get slammed as well as noise from other buildings round the courtyard. I took earplugs  was glad of them.The water from the bath  sink always started off bright orange which was not nice.Breakfast has been well described on this forum but beware if you are in a hurry. We couldn't get in for breakfast one morning due to a tour group leaving. Yes there is a cafe across the road but it has just two chairs  2 stools  these were taken. We were going on a coach tour to Siena so ended up getting breakfast at the train station where we could sit down in relative comfort.I made 3 telephone calls to the UK, the most expensive one was charged as 1.80 euros which I thought was very reasonable.Staff were helpful in getting taxis for us.Location is good for seeing the sights but not exactly bustling with restaurants. We ended up in the same place for 3 nights, the Bigello, as it was the nearest non-pizzeria to the hotel. It was ok - set meal 13 euro, house wine 13 euro. Food not bad but no atmosphere in the place at all, the owner seemed very morose.All in all there must be better places to stay for æ‹¢100 per night.

<Content>Convenient Albergo Firenze We were pleased to book a double room for 103E/night in early Sept and the location can't be beat. The (French) girl at the desk during the day was the most kind and helpful person we encountered in Italy over our 10 day vacation. And a kind maid even loaned us an umbrella on a rainy day. One problem was that our room phone was dead and no one would fix it, later learned that the hotel blocked all 800 number calls from rooms which negated our purchase of a phone card. But the girl at the desk let us use the lobby phone, and also loaned us an electrical converter for our US electronics.

<Content>Great hotel Had a bit of trouble finding hotel - make sure you have a map  good directions before you get to Firenze! Once we got to the hotel it was a great location, staff fairly friendly, room clean  comfortable. Breakfast maid very friendly  delicious breakfast that included fresh bread rolls, croissants, cereal, fruit and juice, tea, coffee or hot chocolate.

<Content>Great Location, Great Room I stayed here for one night earlier this month. I was very happy with my stay in this hotel. The location, off Via del Corso, between the Duomo and the Piazza della Signoria, was perfect for getting around the city center -- everything was a short walk away! My room was clean and simple. It was a single but had a queen sized bed and plenty of room -- I was there alone but I could have easily shared it with a significant other or close friend. Although I was only there for a one night stay, I could have comfortably stayed there for much longer. The breakfast was so much more than most Italian hotels offer. I could actually fill up for the morning there.The only bad things: 1) the internet connection was down and 2) during a thunderstorm, water streamed into my room from the closed window, which I believe gave onto the roof. This sounds much worse than it is, as the water didn't go anywhere when it hit the floor, I'm not sure why. If I had dropped my bags on the floor right under the window I would have been more upset, but since that wasn't the case, it didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the room.

<Content>inconsistent We just returned from a three night stay in Florence where we had two rooms at the Albergo Firenze. The one on the fourth floor was in the new section and large and modern and comfortable. The one on the second floor was not nearly as nice. Both rooms suffered from noise intrusion- sound bounces around the courtyards and closely spaced buildings and comes throught the poorly sealed windows, and lobby noise bounced up the stairs and down the hall and through thin doors on the second floor (that's third floor to us). Both rooms were spotlessly clean. One had a large shower with sliding glass doors, the other had the teeny shower base with curtains that stopped six inches off the floor- big flood- at least the floor has a drain. Knowing what to expect from a european breakfast, we were well pleased with the offerings and the staff couldn't have been nicer. Like everybody says, the location is great. We lucked out and got there during art week when everything was free admittance- the only down side was we pushed harder to see everything, so having a hotel so convenient to rest the dogs for a bit was the best. It was also quite warm during our stay (May 19-22) and there was no working air conditioning in either room . We could have opened a window, but the late night/early morning partyers were too noisy to sleep through. Some of the desk attendants must have come from hostels, they had such a relaxed attitude about things, but they were nice and fairly helpful. Note of interest: because of a strike our flight out of Florence was cancelled and we had to catch a train to Bologna and a flight the next day. Bologna was a wonderful and beautiful surprise, we were actually glad things turned out that way.

<Content>excelent place to stay....economical and a 5 star location My wife and I along with 2 other couples (all in our late 60's) just returned from a 2 week stay in Albergo Firenze on Via del Corso. Each day we felt blessed to have chosen this place....100 euros per day, a location between the Duomo and the Piazza Signoria, the Uffizi,..... within walking distance of every major sight.....we only took a taxi once...and a staff that was responsive to all our needs.....a good european breakfast...and clean simple rooms with lots of hot water....be sure to speak to the manager, Andrea Corrente, if you have any questions.Many nearby good restaurants and cafes (we liked Penello and Piola with an entertaining waiter Rolando, but check with the hotel on which ones to avoid...long live pasta, chianti and gelato....enjoy it all...!!!Be prepared for crowds everywhere....interesting people watching opportunities....Brewster and Cam WardAsheville, NC

<Content>Great Location Don't expect first class here but it is more of a really nice hostel setting. The veiw from the top rooms are great. I really enjoyed the stay here it was awesome. The walls of the rooms are thin, but overall it was a great location and great price for the hotel. Not recommended for honeymooners but great for students or young travellers.

<Content>Served its purpose I stayed here in November when running the marathon.The hotel is fine as a budget hotel for younger people or the young at heart. Facilities are basic but clean. Staff service is on the whole good and breakfast is filling if a touch unexciting.I'm not sure that it would be suitable for families though. There is noise from the street (via Corso), particularly on Friday and Saturday nights, as well as noise from the street cleaning machines in the early hours of the morning. But if you can't put up with that i suppose, you shouldn't choose a city centre hotel!The walls between rooms are rather thin too, so I wouldn't recomment it to light sleepers.Price and location are both excellent though (I paid 60Euro per night for a single). The hotel is 2 minutes from Piazza Della Republica and 5 minutes from the Duomo and Piazza Della Signoria. Virtually every other sight is within walking distance.

<Content>Adult hostel Basically an adult hostel with comforatable beds and very clean bathrooms. Unbeatable location--in the middle of everything--with an excellent price, about 90 Eurors. Breakfast very basic.Would recommend to anyone who wanted a budget hotel in Florence, and we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Amazing Lcoation This hotel is brilliant value for money. The location could literally not be better in between the Doumo and the Piazza della Signoria. The hotel itself is comfortable enough, with clean good sized rooms compete with telephone and hairdryer. Not luxurious but on balance what you save in room costs you will need to sample the many delights of the local restaurants. (Ask the front desk for recommendations.) Yes it is a city centre hotel and as such there is noise from outside. Take earplugs! Any negatives people find about this hotel could surely be offset by the amazing location in such a historical city. If I put my head out the window I could see the top of the Doumo itself.

<Content>Great budget hotel Albergo Firenze is a great little hotel for anyone on a budget, and makes an excellent base to explore Florence from. The location couldn't be better-literally steps away from the Duomo and only a few minutes walk from many of Florences other attractions. Along the street are several places to eat and shop including a very good ice cream parlour!The room was a good size, clean, with a haridryer and TV and balcony. The bathroom was also a good size and the shower was excellent. We also didn't have any problems with noise because our room was at the back of the hotel.The breakfast was fairly basic but was everything we needed-rolls, croissants, yogurts, cereal etc. The staff are helpful and attentive and we felt safe and secure in the hotel.Overall, a great little hotel, I would recommend it to anyone and we will definaltey be staying there again on our next visit to Florence!

<Content>Great location - great hotel! Albergo Firenze is a gem of a hotel tucked away off the Via Corso, it is within walking distance of all the major sights in Florence. The hotel is a 2 minute walk from the Duomo, Palazzo Vecchio, Bargello and Piazza della Republica, and a 10 minute walk from Santa Maria Novella train station.Our room was large, air conditioned and was cleaned every day. It also came with a safe, hairdryer and bathroom with shower and bath. The only things that prevent the hotel getting 5 stars are the fact that we did get quite a lot of street noise at night (tho this may just have been where our room was positioned) and that the breakfast was very basic (we ate at the cafèŒ… opposite the hotel, and would definitely recommend it).All in all for a budget hotel this is ideal - clean, with friendly staff and a better position than many more expensive hotels in the city!

<Content>Great location and value If you're talking value for money, this is the place. It's not at all fancy...more like a glorified dorm room with a private bath, but very clean. If you need luxury or pampering, this is not for you, but then again, you're probably willing to pay a lot more than the Albergo Firenze charges. Good shower/bathroom, so-so air conditioning (keep the AC going and the room darkened while you're out all day, and it will be cooler--the AC goes off at 10 each night to conform to noise laws (because they don't have a low-noise main unit on the roof, it was explained). It was HOT when we were there, and by doing the above, it was fine. But if you really need American-style arctic cool, stay away in the summer months. The location is GREAT, with the Duomo and Piazza delle Republicca steps away. Breakfast is only so-so, but there's a cafe right across the street with everything you need. Safe, cheap, clean...excellent budget lodgings!

<Content>Amazing location This was the most amazing hotel for our large group. I stayed in a triple with a good friend and someone I hardly knew. However, it wasn't at all uncomfortable as it would typically be. You are steps away from most of Florence's best and most known monuments. Also, it is close enough to all the shops that you can stop by the hotel in the middle of the day. The keys are heavy but the hotel staff kindly offers to hold them. In addition, I went running with a friend early in the morning and was able to get out of the hotel easily and painlessly. Finally, our hotel had one and a half bathrooms (a full bathroom and one with just a toilet and sink), which was extremely helpful. I would stay at the Albergo Firenze any time.

<Content>Very clean, but noisy We stayed here for 3 nights in January in a triple room at the front of the hotel. The room was very large, bathroom small but everything was very clean. Only drawback was the noise both inside and out. It was lovely hearing the church bells early in the morning but we could have done without the noisy passerbys from midnight to about 3 am. Also the cleaners would start mopping the corridor floors and steps about 5am every day. Dont know how people can be so chatty at that hour! Breakfast was so so-coffee, juice and a packet of dried toast and brioche in a packet each. That said, the location was fantastic... a few minutes walk to everything.
