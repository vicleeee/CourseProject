<Content>Not Up To Standard We were attracted to this hotel because of some earlier reviews. Yes, the location is good even it is not near a metro station. The local activity around the hotel is interesting and we had absolutely no problems with taxis finding the hotel or even getting a taxi. We did not book the cheaper room but rather a deluxe one hoping that this could add some value to our stay. On arrival, the checkin was efficient but on entering the room the air conditioning was not working. By 11.30pm it was sorted only to stop yet again the next day. Despite repeated requests, it was still not working when we left after five days - only the fan in the unit was working with us having no control over temperature. To counter the heat in the room, we slept with the window open even though it was -6C most nights. On one day the room was not made up and at 9pm they reluctantly gave us fresh towels etc. We made the beds. Toilet paper is treated like gold - half size rolls in all directions and only one in the bathroom at any one time! They don't seem to understand that with two people a second roll might be handy some times. The water in the bathroom was advised as not to be drunk directly. On checkout we were charged for drinking one of the small water bottles in the room which we thought petty given no access to drinking water. Also on checkout we had to unlock our suitcase to return to them a tourist brochure about Beijing. No, it was not a book but only a brochure. We had intended to give it to someone soon to visit Beijing. This hotel needs to understand the usefulness of this type of marketing - for the country and for the hotel and especially so with the current downturn in tourism worldwide. Finally, the walls between the rooms are very thin - noises of a personal nature from the next room could be easily heard in our room. This would definitely not be a hotel to recommend to honeymooners!! To conclude, it was not an intolerable experience but the lack of concern over the air con and the checkout nonsense left a very sour taste in our mouths. No we will definitiely not be back nor could we recommend the hotel to anyone we wanted to keep as a friend.

<Content>Started badly - Got worse. Stayed at the Shatan at the end of Nov for 4 nights.Although the location appears good as its only a short walk to the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Sq. it is also very far from almost anything else.As many have said before, it is on a very narrow Hutong full of local shops and although this can be seen as a good view of local Chinese life, for a first timer in the city it can initially be a bit daunting. (However, despite previous comments a taxi will be able to drive down the Hutong) The taxi (which you will need to get almost everywhere - the City is vast) situation is very strange. Whenever you try and take one from elsewhere in the city the driver invariably has no clue what or were you are talking about (just keep a map with you and point to JinShang Park). But - at various times throughout the day there is literally 8 or 9 waiting outside the hotel lobby, so obviously some of them know it!Lastly the staff are pretty poor, the staff wont let you leave the hotel after check-out until they have sent in a cleaner to check up on you, whilst you stand at the front desk. They then charge you if one of the hand-towels isn`t sparkling white still (which is fairly unlikely as the never changed them for 4 days!).Do not put yourself through this - it is a great city - but stay closer to the Sunlitun Embassy district for a better experience.

<Content>Was definately not as expected We were actually looking forward to our stay at this hotel after reading previous reviews however we were sadly disappointed. The hotel did not realise we were staying for 5 nights so had to find us an available room, after saying there were no double rooms left they magically managed to locate one for us. The room was small and cramped and the bathroom smelt of either sewage or damp which would not go away despite the hotel cleaning it after we had complained, and everytime we had a shower the bathroom floor would flood due to a gap in the shower door. The reception staff were not friendly and seemed at times reluctant to help. The only good thing about this hotel is it's location otherwise we were greatly disappointed and would not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel and Service Stayed at the Sha Tan Hotel for 7 nights in September 2008. The hotel is hard to beat for it's location, service and price. Stayed in a room with a double bed, which was very clean and modern, although very small but still comfortably cozy for 2 people. The lobby was well-maintained and the maid service was good. The room provided 2 bottles of complimentary water, and there was green tea available with no charge. The hotel has business cards with their address and a map on it to hand to taxi drivers. On one side of the car there is a list of popular tourist attractions that you can just check off and hand to the taxi drivers. The day shift staff spoke much better English than the overnight staff so if you require information or want to book a taxi to the airport of Great Wall (just under $100 Canadian to one of teh further sections of the Wall), be sure to ask during the day. The staff will gladly write down the addresses and names of places you want to go in Mandarin to hand to a taxi driver. The hotel's restaurant had a decent buffet breakfast of simple western and Chinese dishes- so don't go expecting pancakes and waffles and you'll be fine. Dinner however was lacklustre so don't bother as there are many delicious and cheap local restaurants on the same street as the hotel including a cafe in a traditional courtyard house which also serves a cheap breakfast and Western as well as Chinese food. The restaurants on the street are fantastic with either English menus or pictures on the menus.Be sure to have the hotel's phone number and a map if possible before you arrive in Beijing. Some taxi drivers had a difficult time finding the hotel, even with a map, but with the hotel's phoen number it was easy enough to ask for directions. The hotel is conveniently located a block from teh north entrance of the Forbidden City, a block from Jingshan Park, and about a 15 minute walk to the nearest subway entrance and main shopping street. The subway stops are not really convenient as they are not really near any major attractions. You are much better off taking a taxi which are inexpensive and charge a flat rate in the evening regardless of distance travelled. You can walk along the outside of the Forbidden City to Tianenmen Square in about 30 minutes, and it's about a 20 minute walk north to the back lakes area.The hotel is located on a hutong or back street. It is busy with locals and can be noisy, but with the hotel windows closed the noise is minimal and rooms are air conditioned anyway. Just be prepared that no one speaks English in Beijing, so ask any complicated questions at the hotel. I would absolutely stay here again for the price.

<Content>Fair Good The Hotel is as follows: Location: Its really hard to find it, almost all taxi drivers refuse to go as the address is not that descriptive, and the location is some how hidden, you need to tell them to drop you on the Shatan Street which is near to the Forbidden City Wall. then u can walk it from there. Location is inside a Local Street Poor alittle, with Some Fruit/Vegtable Markets and 2 small supermarket (incase you want to buy water ). you should consider always haveing the hotel card in ur pocket. Room: Fair Good as i advised, they have free internet but i just knew this when i was leaving as there is not sign saying free internet!!Bathroom is small but enough for a 3 Star hotel, and Beds were fair enough for havin a sleep , Street is quiet @ night. Breakfast: is the worst thing ....its from 7-9, and usually if you got there @ 8 , you will find everything is almost finished ...they dunt re-fill! Anyway, i just spend 3 days so i was not really suffering as most of the time i was out of the room. i just used it for sleeping.

<Content>Avoid if possible Were there in October 2008. The hotel rooms are extremely small and dirty. Upon check-out, bottles of water which were marked with complimentary were charged. Also the included breakfast was charged and discussions did not help as the lady's english was poor and we were in a rush to the airport.Also, at the second underground floor is a brothel marked with sauna.Other problems:- Taxi drivers don't know the hotel, so its difficult to get there- Environment very dirty- Absolutely no view

<Content>Don't pick this hotel unless you are familiar with the area The hotel is located at the center of Beijing city and in a residential area. Local residents live on the same narrow street and you will see their daily life, grocery shopping, meat markets, people riding bicyles or walking. One advantage of staying in this hotel is it is near the Forbidden City and Jingshan Park. There were some things we were unhappy with, such us, the room is small, the bed is hard, AC didn't work well, shower flooded the bathroom floow, breakfast is Chinese-style although they advertised western-style. It was impossible to change the room once we checked in even though we were not satisfied and complained to the management.

<Content>Excellent value This hotel is excellent value. it is very central (Forbidden City in easy walking distance). The room was large enough and clean. The breakfast was OK and when we once had dinner there we noticed that the other guests were Chinese, which we took to be a good sign - most of the hotel guests were back-packer types.The staff were very helpful. We would go there again.

<Content>great location located in the north side of the forbidden city- the street is congested during the day with tour groups but in the morning and at night, the local flavor definitely comes out. skip the hotel's restaurant in the morning for some fresh soymilk, fruits, and scallion pankcakes for breakfast- all available on that street. the hotel staff was ok. they spoke english but wasn't so accomodating. michele gave me bad directions but she also refused to help me beyond what she already did (which were giving me wrong directions) when i asked her if she could call the place- she just denied me. the hallway smells of smoke and sometimes in the morning, smoke lingers into your room- but its all ok for 44/night- without windows. honestly- met my expectations and more.

<Content>outstanding value Just returned from Beijing and staying at the Shatan. This hotel represents outstanding value. We booked a 2 room suite for $87 USD @ night. The room was fantastic. The location of the hotel is also perfect. It's right behind the Forbidden City and a huge park. It's located on a small typically Chinese back street with all the hustle and bustle associated with it. You certainly can stay at one of the chains on one of the main streets, but if your intention is to see and experience Beijing/China this would be the ideal place. I highly recommend this hotel. As a side note, we arranged at the front dest for a cab to take us to the Wall. It cost $500 RMB and the driver waited while we toured and then drove us back- 6 hours in total. I really don't think you need a special guide or pay more than I did.

<Content>Excellent location The location of his hotel is brilliant, within short walking distance to the Forbidden City and Wanfujing shopping street, and was a great price for the location.The counter staff all speak English well and although they aren't overly friendly, they are helpful.The breakfast was alright, I like to have a decent sized breakfast in the morning and there was plenty on offer. I can't say I was that impressed with the dinner menu though.For the traveller whose main concerns are cost and location, I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location, shame about the breakfast! As other reviewers have already stated, the location of this hotel is really fantastic. In fact, it's almost unbeatable... and that in a city, which is very spread out and also prone to traffic problems. It's situated just behind the back gate of the Forbidden City in a hutong area... which gives an extra dash of local colour. We visited right at the end of the Olympics and the service there was excellent and very helpful. The room was not huge, but it was both comfortable and clean. There was a nice bathroom and a pretty large TV with a wide selection of channels (mainly Chinese). The only two slight drawbacks was that the tap water was not suitable for drinking and also the fact that the room was a little smelly. There is a business centre on the ground floor and the speed of the computers is pretty good. Another nice touch is the fact that there are free bikes available... and cycling is a great way of exploring the city. You just need to leave a deposit and off you go! The only really big problem that we had was with the breakfast. The restaurant is in a rather dingy room in the basement and the food selection is definitely geared to Chinese tastes. If you don't want to eat pork and noodles before noon, then this may not be the place for you. The Western alternatives are pretty limited and not very appetising (supermarket-style sliced white bread, for instance) and every time I saw a palatable Chinese option, I lifted up the lid of the tureen in question only to find that it was empty. So, all in all, a very nice stay, but one which left us rather hungry!

<Content>Hilghly recommended I don't normally post reviews of hotels online, but felt compelled after the excellent service offered at Sha Tan during our week's stay. The staff were very kind and really are prepared to go the extra mile to make your stay happy. I agree with all the positive reviews about the location and staff, and also the negative ones about the carpet. This is a minor gripe however. We stayed in a 5-star hotel in the more modern Xidan area the week before whilst I was on business - we definitely did the right thing in moving to the Sha Tan, lest we would have missed out on seeing the local neighbourhood lifestyle. The street is great for people watching as this is an actual functioning neighbourhood. Great value food can be found in the restaurants here - don't be foolded, these are not ritzy restaurants but local diners, though they are used to seeing foregners and some have English menus. Varied fare available and you won't have a chance to get bored with the cuisine. So much so that we hardly used the hotel's restaurant, so I can only comment on the one occasion when we did use room service. The translated menu was hilariously unfathomable (Black pepper Italy Surface, anyone?) but the food was tasty. Services available within a minute's walk include laundry, a bank, greengrocers and a supermarket.

<Content>Great Little Hotel Close to The Forbidden City This is a great little hotel in an ideal location. It is within three minutes of walking to The Forbidden City. Also, it is located within a traditional Beijing hutong neighborhood, so I recommend going out early in the morning or late at night to walk around the neighborhood to get a sense of how locals live in their daily lives. When I was flying from Shanghai to Beijing, the Beijing airport got shut down because of very heavy rains, and my flight was canceled. I thought the hotel would have charged me for that first night, as I became a no show without a proper cancellation. When I arrived the next morning, they told me that they would not charge me for that missed night, as they knew it had been beyond my control.Sunny Yu speaks very good English, and can also help you with tours to The Great Wall, or other places, if you are interested.My room was a bit small, but was very clean. Overall, it's a great hotel, and I am grateful to them for the generously in not charging me for the missed night.

<Content>Good little hotel A decent location and a nice price. It's not extremely close to the metro, about a 20 min walk, but we walked there when we needed it. It''s also less than 5 minutes from the north entrance to the Forbidden City, and a 20 yuan taxi ride from the Beijing Railway Station. It was on a hutong, so hard for the taxi drivers to find, but the hotel e-mailed us a map a couple of days before our arrival and that was all we needed to give the taxi driver. Another benefit from the location was it was on a quiet street, so I slept like a baby. My only complains were that all the glasses and cups in the room were visibly dirty, as well as the white carpet was in need of a good cleaning, but that's China for you.

<Content>Overall good Stayed at the Shatan for 9 nights in June for about 430 euro. Its on a quiet street or hutong very close to the North gate of Forbidden City. Very quiet at night so easy to sleep. Room was large and looked it had been renovated. Carpet could do with a clean but apart from that, it was fine. Tea/coffee/water in room for extra charge but better off to go to shop - much cheaper. Subway is about 15 mins walk away. This wasn't a big deal until recently as there was only 1 subway line but there are 4 now with more to come soyou may want to be closer. Good to see how locals live but beware that if you buy dumlings, fruit etc from the stalls next to the hotel, you will be charged more than locals so only buy where prices are displayed. a couple of good restaurants on the street.overall good hotel on quiet street at good value.

<Content>Good hotel, great location Clean room, great location, service was good, and room was reasonably priced. We took a room without a window but with breakfast included. It was a good trade off as we spent little time in the room and their breakfast was a good start to the day. Room was quiet and only time we wouldn't have minded having a window available was after using the shower. I should mention, i've seen some previous posts concerning the height of the ceiling ... i'm 6'1' and had plenty of space between my head and the ceiling so perhaps this is a room specific issue.Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Amazing Price! We went to Beijing in April/May of 2008 and stayed at the ShaTan for a few nights. The service was excellent!!!! Sunny and Margaret were so accomodating we wanted to take them home! The room was nice considering the great price we got. The bed was firm but that seems to be the case in many Chinese hotels. The only con might have been the carpet but that does not compare to the nicely decorated room, the excellent service and amazing staff! I would definitly reccomend this hotel to somebody who has a budget but still wants to have a great stay in Beijing. TWO THUMBS UP!

<Content>Good hotel in excellent location The Sha Tan Hotel in Beijing was well worth the price paid -- the location was excellent, and the service was top-notch. The front desk spoke perfect English, and the rooms were comfortable.The hotel itself is a short-walk from the Forbidden City, and pretty close to Tiananmen Square as well, as well as several very nice restaurants (though I'd imagine it's pretty hard to get by in those without speaking Mandarin, which my girlfriend did).In short, I definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Wonderful location Loved this hotel, mainly for the location on an interesting Chinese street, very close to the Forbidden City and other tourist sites (although it is quite a walk to the nearest subway station). Reception staff are friendly and speak English fairly well. The rooms are of a good standard for the price. Breakfast hours are a bit restricted (7am - 9am), but have a wide range of Chinese foods to try with the option to create an equivalent of a full English.

<Content>A Hidden Gem in an Awesome Location! Our group of 15 students and teachers stayed at the Beijing Shatan from March 16 to March 21, 2008. I booked the Beijing Shatan because it was located on a hutong only a short walk from the back exit of the Forbidden City. The hotel turned out to be an excellent choice! The staff were friendly, efficient, spoke English and went out of their way to make sure our stay was comfortable. The rooms were modern, clean and each had a mini-bar-fridge and safe. A delicious Chinese/Western buffet breakfast was included in the price of the room. There was also another good restaurant in the hotel and a variety of small inexpensive restaurants, fruit stores, bakeries and a grocery store just a few steps up the hutong from our hotel. In the evening, our students enjoyed using the pool table and games tables located in the basement. I鈥檝e visited Beijing many times and this hotel was the best for it鈥檚 value and location. I will definitely stay at the Beijing Shatan the next time I visit Beijing.Gwena SchuckRichmond, B.C.Canada

<Content>Not so clean Stayed in the hotel for 2 nights. Didn't enjoy my stay here as the room reeked of cigarettes even though we had asked for a non-smoking room. The smell is extremely strong after the bathroom ventilator is turned on. No offence to smokers pls!We are not early wakers, as such, we couldn't make it for the breakfast as it ended at 9 in the morning. The corridor is noisy, especially in the morning.The carpet is very stained and the bathroom floor tiles were coming off. The towel looks unclean too. There were fruits in the room when we checked in, but a staff had come to collect it back and we had no idea why!Overall, it had been an unpleasant stay for us.

<Content>very good value for the price I am a 40 y.o. canadian traveller. Was my first time in China. Stayed in luxury 5 star China World before but that is not real China. Shatan hotel is located in a small street near Jinsang park ( spelling may be wrong)Location is excellent for someone who wants to feel real China. Lots of small and very good native restaurants, little shops, dry cleaner, general market within 5 minutes walking. There is a ATM machine next to corner but doesn not accept all foreign cards( not mine, PLUS network from Canada)There is a decent restaurant at the hotel but never tried. All other things that have been said on this hotel previously are acurate.Ask for a room at the back if you need to be quiet coz I had a room directly on front street ant it is very crowdy and noisy( not an issue for me) Taxis are easily available. Staff is quite fun to deal with and ready to help for anything. Enjoyed a lotYES I would go back( approx rate 500 rmb per night including breakfast)Mike from Montreal Canada

<Content>Not too bad - pleasant surprise Shatan hotel is located near the forbidden city, in a chinese back street. Taxi drivers english is non existant so it is important to get the hotel name in Chinese. From the airport you can catch a bus to the Forbidden city stop-extremely cheap, ask someone where the bus stop is. Then catch a taxi from the forbidden city stop to the hotel. The hotel tself is very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff speak some english, there is one lady there who speaks excellent english. Get them to book a taxi for you when you want to go out. Also ask the staff to write the location you want to go to in Chinese.We booked on Venere and a double was around A$75 to A$80 per night including breakfast - if you like Chinese for breakfast its great, if you want western, not much on offer, mainly cakes, coffee and juice.Dont be put off by the location of the hotel - it is on Shatan Houji (back street), walk down the street mix with the locals, they are harmless. Travel everywhere by taxi, the fares are ridiculously cheap. Make sure you get a card with the hotel address in chinese from reception, they also have cards with some of the tourist attractions in Chinese.We went on a day trip to the great wall of China, dont go on an organised tour, Beiling city offers tours to the great wall for 90RMB or 160RMB to see the Ming tombs as well-you get a guide and lunch is included. The bus stays with you the whole day and it drops you off at Ming Tombs for 70 minutes and then continues on to Great wall and you have 2 hours here. It is a good price and a good experience. Talk to the lady at Shatan Hotel reception, the one which speaks good english - you catch the bus near tianamin square. Overall good comfortable hotel with helpful staff

<Content>Great hotel A good quality three star hotel. Clean facilities and clean rooms. friendly front counter staff. The hotel is close to Forbidden City. Getting around is a little difficult as it is quite a walk to the subway.Hotel breakfast was included in our package. We really enjoyed the wide variety of Chinese style dishes for breakfast. Very little western style breakfast which didn't worry us as we were enjoying the variety. The hotel is located on an interesting hutong (backstreet) which by itself (the hutong) is worth the trip to Beijing.At the end of the street is a nice cafe selling real espresso coffee.There is a bank with ATM around the corner although the exchange rate at the hotel was just the same.I would stay at Shatan Hotel again.

<Content>unbeatable location and price, good enough comfort while in beijing i found (i was just passing by i walked in) this fantastic hotel right behind the forbidden city -what means that the location is truly unbeatable. it's website is [--], not a luxury hotel by any means but far above average, including air-con in all rooms, of course private bathroom, also flat-screen... no cnn however since this is basically a real chinese hotel, ideal for those looking for a genuine chinese experience without paying a price in comfort of going too far in terms of cultural immersion. breakfast is good enough -again, no luxury but you will not get hungry and they have both chinese and western food -and it's complimentary. staff are very attentive -there english is basic but good enough, if you run into any little problem the manager is a very young guy with a lot of enthusiasm...he's willing to help. they have a small travel agency that can help with flight reservations (i cant remember if they charge any fee but in any case it was nothing significant), the hotel also has a business center, in practice a small room with two computers and an internet conection which can keep you in touch with the rest of the world. if one can afford a super luxury hotel, this is not for you. if, however, you're looking for an affordable price with just decent comfort + and unbeatable location this is your place (by the way, taxi drivers may not know the place but as soon as you show them the map they will have no trouble finding it...even taxi drivers can believe this hotel is right behind the forbidden city).

<Content>great location ! the location of the hotel is just a short walk from the forbidden city and it's quite a central location. However, no taxi drivers have heard of the hotel and you have to be sure to tell the adjacent street.The breakfast is not too good but the room is nicely furnished and comfortable with a large LCD tv. bed is very comfy and although it's a 3 star, it's better than some of the 4 star i stayed in China. A hotel owned by the china petroleum group and the rooms looks to be quite newly renovated which is definitely a plus. The whole of beijing is quite newly touched up so it's a nice time to visit Beijing now and stay at this hotel. Oh, forget to mention there is a supermarket just beside the hotel which is excellent! there are fruit stalls down the street as well. Great! I enjoyed my stay at the Shatan to say the least..
