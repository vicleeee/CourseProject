<Content>Convenience! I had booked a cruise out of San Pedro and decided to head up from San Diego a day early so that it would be convenient to board our ship. The Vagabond offered 8 days of free parking for one night's lodging. The accommodations are average, but the staff took care to answer all questions and gave us a computer-generated map to a movie theatre to kill time the evening before our departure. After a complimentary continental breakfast the hotel took us in their van right to the berth, which saved dragging all of our bags across the terminal's parking lot. The best part of the stay was the convenience. The night's lodging was very inexpensive when you figure the cost of keeping your car at the terminal's parking lot for seven days. The taxi ride back from the terminal to the hotel to pick up our car was under $10.

<Content>Honest We stayed at the Vagabond Inn in San Pedro one night just prior to our cruise. We found the hotel clean and the staff was very friendly and honest. In a rush to meet up with our shuttle, my 24 year old daughter left her cell phone in her room and did not realize it until the ship departed. She called the hotel and spoke to Kumar who told her that they found it and would hold onto it for her. Upon our return, they had her phone and returned it. My daughter was very grateful. I would highly recommend this hotel. It is an older hotel but the rooms are comfortable and the staff is friendly.

<Content>Easy Pre Cruise Hotel Stayed here for one night before a cruise...Shuttle from airport dropped us at hotel...Room was all ready..No hassles...Old decorating but SUPER CLEAN..No smell, bathroom spotless, bedding excellent... No Noise that bothered us. Took a taxi to Port o Call for dinner and shopping and back, about $5 each way... Shuttle to the ship in the morning was ready to go when we were - around 10am...Definitely would stay there again before a cruise...Not a destination hotel but defintely a good inexpensive place to spend the night

<Content>Value for money We booked this Inn by mistake, actually we wanted to stay in another vagabond inn, but as we did not book it through vagabondinn.com but through hotels.com, the cutomer service of vagabondinn could not change the booking. Lesson learnt! But finally it was not a bad choice all in all. We arrived very late but the checkin went smoothly. The price was good compared for what you get. Room was clean, we had TV with HBO, wireless internet access for free. Only really downside was the noise. We got a room on the front side of the motel. Next time I would probably try the backside of the motel, because the noise from the traffic was disturbing during the night. Next to this motel there are several places to eat (McDonalds, TacoInn, Wienerschnitzel etc) There is a laundry just 300 m away. The Inn offers free parking as well, and it is easy to find and not so far from the LAX.

<Content>Very Nice, Clean Hotel for Budget Price... We stayed here for 1 night before our cruise. I knew from other folk's (online) reviews that this hotel would not be the 'Ritz' but a good, clean, basic, budget hotel. I totally agree...this hotel was a VERY good value for the money. Even though the room was small (no extra chairs or small table in a double room) it was very clean. In fact...the bathroom was the cleanest I have seen and used in a hotel for a very long time...and I can compare the cleaniness to many 5 star hotels I had been in. I know that is hard to believe, but I think since this hotel is older the staff really tries very hard to keep it as clean and nice as possible. They accomplished that as far as I was concerned. The pool was nice. They advertise a continental breakfast: it consists of donuts, coffee, tea and the best Guava juice I have had since I vacationed in Hawaii. There is is liquor store right across the street, McDonalds and KFC next to it..takes less than 1 min. to get to each. They also provide a FREE shuttle to the cruise port. I will most certainly stay again at this hotel if I ever cruise out of LA again. I gave this hotel an above average rating because of the Cleaniness, Free Shuttle to Cruise Port, Friendly/Helpful Staff, Great Vaule for the money--however it is an older hotel and that should be remembered and considered by anyone before staying here.MonaK

<Content>Ok for the night Inexpensive place to spend the night in LA. Paid about US$70+ for a weekend night. Rooms looked old. The carpet was a bit dirty. My feet were black walking on the carpet. Towels and bedsheets were clean though. I reached the place at about 11pm, so literally I just spent the night there. Ample free parking. Hotel was secured in that you needed a key to go into the hotel compound. Hotel had air con, free wifi. Overall ok for the night.

<Content>Convenient location but very noisy We stayed here 2 nights. The room was clean but very worn. The staff was very nice. Our problem with the hotel is its location on busy S. Gaffey Street. The traffic is 24/7 - we finally turned on the A/C unit to attempt to drown out the vehicle noise. I had read reviews on various web sites and knew it was on a busy street so asked for a room on the backside when we checked in. I was told the tenants in the apt. building behind the hotel sometimes played their music extremely loud so it probaby wouldn't be any better. I wish I would have tried it anyway - the music couldn't have been any worse. If you are used to a lot of road noise, this hotel would be adequate. We live at the end of a dead end road so are used to extreme quiet. Also very disappointing is a breakfast that consisted of donuts, coffee, and juice. It was convenient to the ferry terminal - only a 10 minute ride, perhaps less.

<Content>Perfect for Cruising out of the LA Port We read the reviews herein about the close proximity to the LA port and were able to book a 1 night stay before our cruise. The room was bare bones but clean i.e. bathroom and bed. There is a Sushi restaurant, a Starbucks and McDonald's a block away. 2 blocks down is a Rite Aid and a Big 5 sporting goods store if you forgot anything before your cruise. I travel a lot for work and fortunate enough to stay at 4 star hotels, nonetheless, for a 1 1/2 star rating the Vegabond exceeded my expectations. There is coffee and donuts in the a.m. We were able to park our car at the Motel for 1 week for the price of $50. This was $24 cheaper than at the port. There is a free shuttle that runs every 15 minutes from the Motel to the port that begins at 10 a.m. We took a cab back to the Motel after our cruise and it cost us $7 minus tip. The customer service at the Vegabond was good and professional. If you are not hung up on accomodations and need a clean place to stay before your cruise, I highly recommend this Motel.

<Content>You get what you pay for This hotel was inexpensive, so we didn't expect the Ritz Carlton.It was a pretty basic room, but the double beds were like bricks. The comforter was also worn. Plus, don't expect a wake-up call! We asked for one, it never came. Thank God I set our cell phones to go off.Also, we stayed there for three nights...Thursday-Sunday. On both Friday and Saturday night, our room cards didn't work. We had to go to the front desk and get new ones. That was a major inconveniece. We booked this room because we had to fly to CA for a funeral. We had already spent a ton on last minute flights, so we were looking to save money on a hotel room. The room did the job, but the next time we visit family in Southern CA, we will NOT be staying here.

<Content>Can't say enough good things about the Vagabond in San Pedro, CA I would like to tell people about this hotel.....it is a very reasonably priced option and sometimes reasonably priced means you suffer in other aspects of the room. NOT SO HERE!! I live on Catalina Island and this is my go to choice for when I need to come over to the mainland for business, Doctor's appts. or leisure.I have not only stayed here on this visit (Jan '08) but I have been coming here since 2004, when I moved to Catalina. I often stay either by myself or with my young daughter and I always feel safe and appreciated by the staff.Kazi Ahmed is the General Manager and he has been incredibly accommodating every time I have stayed.We were victim's of the fires on Catalina last May; I came over at the last minute  was able to get a room on short notice. One of Mr. Ahmed's desk clerks helped us get settled, finding us a refrigerator....we ended up having to stay for 5 nights, until we were able to come back to our home. Mr. Ahmed's hospitality went above and beyond, in our opinion. The rooms are always clean, comfy and if I've ever needed anything, any of the staff does their best to help! Our family definitely recommends the Vagabond Inn, San Pedro !T.MontagnaCatalina Island

<Content>Fair for the price... The motel is located on 2nd and Gaffey in San Pedro, CA. All of the hotels/motels in the area are super-costly in comparison to the Vagabond. The rooms are fairly nice for the price, however they have certain ammenities that I feel are lacking. They do not include a coffee maker (you have to go to the front office to get your coffee in the morning) and the fridges in the room do not work! Why would they place fridges in all of their units and then cut the power cords in the back? Is the extra electricity really killing them? Seems ridiculous to me... The best part of this motel is that they allow pets. It's a hard thing to find nowadays (at a reasonable price), especially in the San Pedro area...

<Content>Noisy We stayed here for one night. The price was good compared for what you get. Room could be cleaner. We did not get the TV functioning. Only really downside was the noise. We asked for a room on the backside of the motel, but we were told that those rooms were smoking rooms. Furthermore the guy behind the desk told us that there was a problem building behind the motel, which caused a lot of noise. So we got a room on the front side of the motel. Maybe try the backside of the motel if you stay there, because the noise from the traffic was very disturbing during the night. We did not sleap very well.

<Content>Be Aware... Good points - close to the cruise center and they did provide a shuttle there and back; price of room was cheapNot so good points - Bare bones accomodations; fairly clean; the carpet was nasty. It advertises a restaurant on site. There is no restaurant called Jodis and the clerk at the desk said there never has been. Continental breakfast consisted of a 3' X 4' area with a box of donuts and coffee makers. No seating and when we went down at 9AM, there was no sign of anything except coffee. Also, we were traveling with an adult who had difficulty manuvering luggage and steps. Even to get to rooms on the first floor you had to go up several steps. Restaurants nearby are mostly fast food. We did go to the Holiday Inn next door and their restaurant was very good. Would I stay at the Vagabond Inn again? Probably not.

<Content>very close to the world cruise center My wife and I went with my parents on a one day cruise on the norwegion pearl. We stayed at the vagabond inn in san pedro ca.The motel is less than a mile away from the world cruise center. We found the motel to be a very great deal. Well priced, less than a mile away comfortable and about 5 minutes from door to door.We will stay there again.We stayed there the day before and again the day after the cruise.

<Content>It served our purpose We used this particular hotel because it has a Cruise and Stay plan. It was very easy to get to and had no problems at all. The room was adequate in size for three people. It was clean and comfortable. The staff was accommodating and helpful. There is plenty of eating establishments close by. The Vagabond even bussed us over to the point of departure. I would definitely stay there again. We took a short drive down the street from the hotel and found an excellent Mexican restaurant for dinner on the evening we arrived. And on the same street we found a great caf茅 for breakfast the next morning. We even found a 99 cent store to look around in.

<Content>Bring flipflops and earplugs I needed a place for the night before a cruise on the S.S. Lane Victory at 7:30 a.m. the following morning.Strangely, although the room was very clean, the furniture in good shape, and the bed comfortable, the carpet of Room 215 was FILTHY. It made the soles of my feet black within five minutes of my stepping out of the shower. (If you take the trouble to scrupulously clean the rest of the room, why not shampoo the carpet once in a while?)Also, though the hotel appeared to be barely occupied, the desk clerk claimed it was full, and wouldn't give me a quieter room on the back side of the hotel. In the rooms facing Gaffey Street, the traffic sounds are LOUD (cars with thumping speakers at all hours; big rigs downshifting for the stoplight half a block away; police sirens). I had to leave the air on all night to try to muffle the noise. Also, as mentioned in other reviews, the neighborhood looks a bit iffy, and I wouldn't walk around there after dark. The 21 Sushi restaurant next door was good and reasonably priced; it was frequented by regular local customers, many of whom the owner greeted by name.If the carpet were cleaner, this would be a good hotel for the price.

<Content>Good Enough My fiance and I stayed at this hotel on 7/6-7/7. We chose this hotel because it was the best rated of the few hotels close to an event we were attending at Ft. MacArthur. The room and bathroom were both clean, although, the carpet felt sticky, so I don't recommend walking around the rooms barefoot. The two problems I have with the hotel were 1. it smelled like urine and cigarette smoke, and 2. it seems to be convenient for prostitutes, and in a not-so-great area. It was fine for us because it was better than camping on the hard ground and when I woke up in the middle of the night with a migrane it was much better to be in a bed than in a tent. We will probably stay there again, unless something better opens up in the area.

<Content>Good value for the money I was pleasantly surprised. The room was average, but clean and very quiet. I called the hotel a couple of times to get info and they were very helpful. We booked the car storage package and were very surprised how easy it was to check in, leave the car, and pick up the shuttle the next morning.I became ill while traveling and the front desk was very helpful with finding a pharmacy nearby (withing walking distance) and letting us check out late so I could get my prescription filled. I wasn't too comfortable walking around at night (to the McDonalds 1/2 block away for dinner) but was just fine during the day.Shuttle service to the pier was clean and effecient. Only drawback is that you have to take a cab back to the hotel when you return from the cruise and finding a cab for 4 adults and their luggage was a little hard, but only cost $8 plus tip.Overall, I would stay here again and would recommend it to a friend.

<Content>Jewel in the rough internet special rates made this a very affordable stay in an expensive area of the country, especially since i had pets with me. the staff was friendly and accommodating. the room was surprisingly clean, especially for an older facility. the hotel is convenient to area highways and very accessible to long beach.

<Content>good for overnight Good only for 1-2 night stay. Don't recommend for a week long stay unless you're looking for a cheap lodging. Hotel is pretty decent...clean room, bathroom, etc. It is located in a busy street. There are a few food places in the area. The sushi place next to it is good. There's also McDonalds and other fast food restaurants in the area. A few flaws we encountered: (1) toilet is not fastened properly on the floor so it wiggles a little bit when you sit on it; (2) TV remote not working and TV channel keeps going back to the initial channel (maybe program setting issue but we didn't bother troubleshooting); (3) toiletries are unscented so bring your own; (4) we stayed at a 2-double bed room so we expected 4 towel set but no they only had 2 sets for 2 people and we had to pick up extra ones from the front desk; (5) we stayed for 2 nights and after a daytrip to Santa Catalina Island we are looking forward to a good night sleep but when we got there our keys didn't work and we had to go back to front desk again to get new keys. The towel issue repeated again and we had to go to the front desk to get extra ones again. We were hoping if they saw 4 used towels that they'd replace 4 but no they only left 2 towels.

<Content>Great Pre-cruise Lodging Stayed here one night prior to our cruise. The rooms are well equipped and are larger than any cabin on the ship, unless you booked the suite of course. The hotel is clean and the staff, especially the Manager, (Kazi) are extremely helpful and friendly. Location couldn't be better with all the restaurants within walking distance. The hotel even has a pool. Breakfast consists of coffee or tea and the Manager brings in boxes of donuts.You could walk to the port if you had time to kill (about 20 minutes) but the hotel offers a complimentary shuttle van. From LAX ,you just have to hop on one of the shuttle vans (Super Shuttle or Primetime) and they'll drop you off at the door. It couldn't be easier.Let's face it, beside the time you're asleep, you probable spend less than 2 waking hours per day in your hotel room, so all I really look for is a place that's clean, safe and convenient.It may not be the Hilton, but the rates are very reasonable and I would recommend this place in a heartbeat.

<Content>Great Place Near the Bay This is the third time over the last 16 months that we have stayed at the Vagabond Inn. It is in a wonderful location on Gaffey Street which is the main street entering San Pedro from Route 110-S. It is just a few blocks from the bay and is quite convenient to all of San Pedro's attractions. The inn is clean and well maintained with very comfortable beds. We've found the staff to be consistently friendly and helpful. We'll always stay at the Vagabond when in the area and in fact we'll be there later this summer.

<Content>Great place to stay Nice room, and the best thing was that we were allowed to leave our car there for a small fee while we were on our cruise. Saved a bunch of bucks on parking. When we returned, the car was just fine. My only complaint was that they shuttled us to the terminal to catch the ship, but didn't bring us back to the motel when we returned, and we had to catch an $8.00 cab ride.

<Content>Did the job We only stayed the one night prior to sailing out of Los Angeles on a cruise. We picked this motel as it was handy to the terminal. We found the rates reasonable, the staff friendly, the rooms comfortable and clean and the shuttle to the ship reliable. There are some places to eat close by but we were warned not to walk alone at night so we picked to eat next door. It is a little far from any shopping precinct so be expected to spend the time in your room. There was fresh coffee in the lobby.

<Content>Great Service Date: 21 Feb 2007Reviewer: Casual GuestWe stayed at the Vagabond Inn, San Pedro, CA for one night on our way to take a Mexican Cruise. Not only was the hotel clean and well appointed, but the service was outstanding. The desk clerk was able to recommend an excellent restaurant within walking distance of the hotel. Also, we had planned to leave our car at the Port Of Los Angeles Terminal parking lot. However, the clerk pointed out their own long term parking at the hotel. We did leave our car there for 8 days and found it in fine condition when we returned. Not only did the hotel offer long term parking, but they shuttled us to the boat terminal. We did have to take a taxi back to the hotel after the cruise. The cost was only $8, so we saved a total of $52 by parking at the Vagabond Inn, instead of the Port parking area. Should we be in San Pedro again we will definitely stay here.

<Content>good park and sail value We had heard about this hotel from an aquantance. They have a rate that allows you to stay at the motel and leave your car there while you take a cruise. We are use to staying at 3 star or higher hotels and were alittle concerned by the rating. To our surprise the people were friendly the place seemed in good repair although alittle old. The parking lot was well lit and the area seemed safe. We walked down the street to a near by pizza parlor. I would do this again.

<Content>expect to get more than you pay for! We stayed here to take advantage of the park and cruise package. This is San Pedro CA, so you must know ahead of time that this is not a good part of town. Knowing this, we still like being 5 monutes from the cruise terminal, and having a place to park. The parking at the pier is 10 dollars a day, (70.00 for a 7 day cruise) and you still need a place to stay the night if you are comming from out of town. The price of the hotel room is very fair for the area and the parking is included. Now, they just purchased a brand new 10 passenger shuttle van, so you don't even have to pay for a taxi to the pier. The owner of this hotel could not be any more helpful! He is truly a customer service kind of guy. The rooms are a little old and tired, and this hotel sits on a busy street . The night time noise is a little loud....still ,I usually am so excited about getting on a cruise the next morning that I don't get much sleep anyway.There are plenty of places to eat within walking distance, there is a RiteAide next door so you can pick up any last miute items you need for your cruise.All in all, for the price, location, and convenience of the free pier shuttle; YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER DEAL!We have stayed here several times, and will stay again if we have a cruise leaving out of San Pedro.

<Content>What we expected, but a little worse We booked this because they offered a park and cruise package. We arrived Sat evening and could not find a parking space on the property. We were told to keep looking and something would open up. We finally found a place, but then couldn't go anywhere to eat dinner because we were afraid we wouldn't have a parking spot to come back to. Pretty scary neighborhood, I would not advise walking around after dark. Lots of fast food places. The hotel was not terrible, the shower was very clean! We were able to catch a shuttle to the dock, but were told that the shuttle doesn't pick up to return to the hotel at the end of the cruise. You get what you pay for. No extras, nothing fancy.

<Content>A nice place We stayed at the Vagabond in San Pedro before leaving for our cruise. The room was very nice and the gentlemen at the front desk was extremely helpful. I would definately stay here again when taking our next cruise.
