<Content>fantastic location and very nice and competent staff This august my husband and I stayed at this hotel and had a great experience. The hotel is located in the street that leads from ponte vecchio to a quiet part of the city where the shops of the artisan and antique are. It is only ten min on foot to the city centre. The room was very simple, but very bright and spacious. The breakfast was out of the normal, more like in a four star hotel: various yogurts, orange juice (real one, not the watery one we found in other hotels), croissants and delicious cappucinos...The stuff is very helpful. whatever information or help we needed, they were always there for us and never hesitated in giving us advice (like looking up train time tables and printing them, advice about where to find good restaurants, or where to go shopping...). If we ever come back to Florence we'll surely be staying at hotel Boboli.

<Content>Just so-so at best... The hotel is in a good locating but has no elevator. The 3rd floor really is the 4th floor. Hanging wallpaper; flat hard pillows; hard bed; dirty stairwell; No A/C  if you keep the window open you'll get bitten by lots of mosquitoes. You shower over the toilet and the towels are terrible. Nice staff. This is not a 3 star hotel as advertised. Pictures are very misleading.

<Content>Quiet in the heart of the city We stayed in the spring, so can't comment on heating or cooling, but we can applaud the location and the helpfulness of the staff. Also, since our room faced a green inner courtyard, we were impressed by the quiet. We heard no street noise and awoke to the songs of birds. We know from the experience of others that the streets in this part of Florence are very noisey at night.

<Content>A nice hotel directly in the city centre My friends who came to visit me in June 2008 stayed at the Hotel Boboli. They were very satisfied because the room was clean, the breakfast tasty and the staff very friendly and helpful. Moreover, the staff helped my friends to reserve tickets for the Uffizi and gave other information about the city. The best thing was that the hotel was situated directly in the centre and so they just had to walk some minutes to reach all important sights. At the end of their stay they told me when they come back they would like to stay again at the Hotel Boboli.

<Content>If you are smart donéº“t stay at the Boboli Dirty, clumsy and impolite personnel, no lift or air conditioning, no proper shower or towels, broken down furniture, mosquitoes in summer, no view...do I need to say more?You can get much better accomodations for the same price in Florence.It was our worst experience in Italy.

<Content>It's OK Just returned from a week stay in Florence, divided between two hotels, on of which was the Boboli. No, there's no elevator. Our room was fairly large, bed was a king, and comfortable. Bathroom was spotless, but needed tiles replaced and the door did not close due to warping. The breakfast was typical for the hotels we stayed in--hard rolls, croisants, juice, ham and cheese. Cappuchino, prepared to order. This hotel is close to the Pitti Palace, but is on the far side of the Arno-- so you can see that as a positive, if you like quiet, or as a negative--it's a hike to get to the center of things. Staff were pleasant. We most likely would not stay there again, due to the location and our desire to walk everywhere.

<Content>No rest for the weary Not a bad location - on V. Romana about mid-way between Ponte Vecchio and Piazze della Calza. Not a bad room - decent size, satisfactory bed, flat tired pillows. First strike was the bathroom - tiny, no shower stall or curtain, very low water pressure. Second strike was the thin walls - guest in next room sneezed, I said Gesundheit. Third strike was the street noise - room overlooked V. Romana, impossible to sleep with windows closed (and no A/C).Price was okay. Breakfast was okay. But probably won't stay again.

<Content>Moved our room without notification Stayed here in late June/early July because had read that they were under new management. Maybe so, but nothing has been improved. Experienced all the travails of previous reviewersNo elevators to haul up suitcases, no A/C, no screens so mosquitoes came in in swarms, tiny portable fan plugged into a dangling outlet plate with exposed wires. The first room we were in had a window opening onto a balcony whose door was from the common hallway. There was no lock on the window so anyone could have opened the shutters and come right in. Someone did go out there every evening to smoke so our room would stink of cigarette smoke unless we closed the window and stifled. Had to wrap the towel in a drycleaning bag so it wouldn't be soaked in the bathroom when showeringWe requested another room for security reasons and in writing were told that room would be ours for the remainder of our stay. What was our surprise to come back one evening to be told they had moved our things (which had been unpacked) back to the original room - nice to have hotel staff carrying your underwear, etc around. They neglected to check any drawers and told us unless we specifically told them what was in each drawer they wouldn't get it. So four phone calls later - my nightgown, my travel guides, my travel journal, my stamps I think we finally got it all. When we showed the manager the written note about that being our room for the remainder of our stay he told us the receptionist had 'made a mistake'. The man who manned the evening desk was the only polite, helpful individual. Everyone else we dealt with was rude and surly.

<Content>Mosquitos in June We would not stay at Boboli again:-- No A/C in June and it was hot-- Open windows let in many mosquitoes and we had terrible bites-- Bathroom has open shower (no curtain or doors), so whole bathroom gets wet-- Towels are smooth cotton/linen type (not terry cloth) and very stingy; no place to hang them, so we clipped them to hangers and hung them from the window shutters out of desperation-- Hotel is not clean-- Bathroom doors on one of our rooms were rotting away-- Far from town (we usually took the bus; it was a good 20 minute walk to the edge of town and our feet were killing us from so much walking in Rome before this part of our trip).-- No internet access-- Breakfast was very meagerGood points:--I nternet cafe and laundromat within walking distance.-- #11 and 36/37 bus route very close by and convenient-- Cold bottles of water in fridge in lobby for 1.5 Euro-- they gave everyone fans after the first miserable night-- staff service was mixed; some was so-so; others were very good

<Content>Satisfactory We stayed 4 nights at the Boboli and were very satisfied with our visit. Room was certainly functional rather than plush and breakfast rather basic, but value was outstanding, costing us around æ‹¢15 per person per night. The location is fine, 15 minute walk into the centre, and staff were helpful. It was very cold at night when we stayed, and a heater had been provided for us without us having to ask. This allowed us to control the room temperature ourselves. Plenty of good eating places around, in what initially seems a backwater street.

<Content>winter woolie hotel I would not consider this hotel unless you are on a very strict budget. Rooms are bare and heat is only turned on at very strict times. Only one thin blanket and sheet on the bed and the room so cold that there was condensation on the inside of the window. Bring your winter woolies with you as any request for more heating will be met with a direction to a note in reception with the prescribed times . You will not be allowed to be cold outside of these times even if you are. Do not consider if you want any degree of comfort

<Content>Hotel Boboli - Quaint hotel near Boboli Gardens I just returned from my visit to Italy where I stayed at Hotel Boboli in Florence. This hotel is just a short walk from the back entrance of the Boboli Gardens. The staff was so very courteous and complied with all requests. It was not fancy but very clean and safe. There was no air conditioning but the fan in our room along with the open window made sleeping very comfortable. Our room was in the back and quiet. I chose this hotel because it was near the apartment of my daughter, who studied in Florence this summer. I would definitely stay at Hotel Boboli on a return trip to Florence.

<Content>Not very nice Hotel Boboli was not a very nice place to stay. On the plus side, you get quite a large room and a reasonably good breakfast. It is also nice and close to the Ponte Vecchio, but a bit of a hike from the centre of town. However, the name 'Hotel Boboli' is quite deceiving; you are far more likely to have a view of an always busy (and very noisy) road than the nearby gardens. That said, the noise is not the main problem with this hotel. The main problem is the bathroom which, although only about 1.5 square metres, contains a toilet, bidet, shower and basin. This means you are essentially showering OVER the bidet and toilet; it smelt dreadful and everything gets wet while you shower. Also the towels were quite strange - more like tablecloths or hospital sheets than towels! We would not stay at this hotel again; it was noisy and smelly and not very good value at all.

<Content>Terrible time at the Boboli We arrived about 11.00 p.m,due to late flight,both tired,and thirsty.The night porter(?)greeted us with-'about time'. We asked to be shown the lift,to be told 'no lift',We are 2 middle aged ladies.We dragged out suitcases up 2 flights of stairs.The room was dreadful, ripped wallpaper and old lino on the floor,and the bathroom...... As it was late we had to stay.We then ventured down to the reception. The Porter was on his mobile phone,and he made sure that he finished his conversation before turning to us. We foolishly asked if we could have a hot drink. Why were we not suprised when the reply was'no hot drinks'? The breakfast was adequate, but by now we had decided we had had enough. I think the musty smell was the last straw. We promptly found a lovely hotel near the Ponte Vecchio,who made our holiday. The staff at the Boboli didn't seem the remotest bit concerned that we booked out,they didn't ask what was wrong. Never again.

<Content>Not recommended. What a horrible, over-priced hotel. We knew we shouldn't expect too much; it is only a 2-star hotel in Florence after all, but this was pretty bad, especially considering the prices they dare to ask. We are not the complaining type -in fact this was the first time we did.A room almost stripped bare, without curtains, the floors looked like they had not been cleaned in ages, a tiny shower room that had not been cleaned well, toilet without a toilet seat, and the waste paper basket had not been emptied. (On the positive side, the beds seemed clean.)You couldn't leave anything in the shower room, because the shower would spray over everything, including towels (which looked like they were made from old sheets). We complained on the night itself and the next day, and were offered a 20 euro discount. The man at the reception spoke to the manager on the phone and said we were only complaining because we wanted a discount (luckily my sister speaks Italian, or we wouldn't have known). But how else can you make them compensate for a room as dismal as this. They did not even apologise, just said other people were happy to pay.

<Content>keep distance from Hotel Boboli I stayed at Boboli last year, as per suggestion of a Brazilian travel magazine. Definetelly is the worse place to stay in Florence for 3 main reasons: 1) the location is not nice: is in the way-out of all touristic attractions. Even being walking distance from Vecchio Bridge (abt 800mts) is quite far from everywhere, there are hundred places better located.2) the rooms are not minimally gracious, and only a few have view for the Boboli Gardens which absolutelly would not justify the name. I stayed thee in summer (June) and our room didn't have air conditioning. Be advised that florence is like a sauna being almost impossible to sleep comfortably in a room with no air conditioning.3) finnaly, the hotel doesn't have elevator and they assigned us a room in the 5th fllor. Believe me, that hotel SHOULD have an elevator. It's terrible to carry your luggage thru the stairs.The staff is friendly and tried to solve the missing of air-conditing by offering us a fan, but refused to refund the deposit. We tried to sleep on night there - which was impossible - and in the following day we moved to a hotel near to the ceentral station with elevator/air conditioning in a better place paying the same price as in the Boboli.
