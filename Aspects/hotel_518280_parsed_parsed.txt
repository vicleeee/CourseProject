<Content>Room Mate Great! Highly recommend this hotel especially if you book on a special promotion rate as we did. Hotel staff are friendly and really helpful and made us feel very welcome in New York. Location is superb if you want to be near Time Square. Breakfast is fantastic! Take your bathers with you for a dip in the hotel pool.

<Content>Weekend in New York Great hotel. Very convenient location close to Times Square and Gray Line Bus tour and with several Irish pub/restaurants on the same street.We checked in about 10:30 am and were told we could take advantage of the breakfast which was great since we had left home very early and hadn't had a chance to eat. Our rooms were very clean and ready for us upon arrival. They were a little on the small side but this did not really matter since we were out sightseeing all day and only returned late at night to sleep. The decor is very modern and quite unique. Breakfast is excellent - lots of choice (fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, toast, bagels, croissants, juice, tea/coffee). The staff let us leave our bags for the day after we checked out and ordered a taxi for us. Customer service was excellent.

<Content>Fun Hotel in Great Location Just returned from a great stay at this hotel the weekend before Christmas. The location can't be beat, and the staff was very friendly. I got an excellent rate on Hotwire. I thought the room was larger than a couple of other rooms I've had in NYC. You actually have some closet space and storage room under the bed.I'm not a big fan of the bathroom layout - it really depends how close you like to be to your roommate.I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Amazing Hotel - Hidden Gem Stayed here over the Christmas holidays. I was a bit concerned when we arrived as the hotel from the street was nothing to rave about and the reception also serves as a concession stand however the hotel impressed me.We stayed in one of the petite rooms and it was just that. Small but it had an amazing bed and nice tv. There was no bath but one of those rain showerheads. This is what I expected when booking the hotel on hotwire.The service was amazing. Everyone was very helpful and polite. The exercise room was small with free weights, 2 bikes and not much else. Everything was working however.The pool and bar area was the best part. When you walk in you pass by the steam room, the sauna and go down several steps to the pool. They have fresh fruit and the pool is 80'+. Great music is playing (on the weekend they even had a DJ) and their is a window where you can swim up and order drinks! It was definitely a boutiqish hotel but I would recommend it to anyone under 40 looking to have a great time.The only issue was the floor lighting outside the sauna. It looks like they replaced the bulbs with ones a bit more powerful than designed as when I stepped on one it burnt my foot. They gave me a spray to use and said that they would look into it.

<Content>In one word: Excellent True: the rooms are tiny, but I think that is the case in every hotel in Manhattan. Every space is optimised. The personnel is very friendly, the breakfast is excellent, the hammam and swimmingpool a warm welcome after all those hours off visiting and walking, the dj is good, the ambiance is relaxed, the hotel kiosk very well equiped (from a dog leash to lubrifant gel!) but most of all, it is only a few feet from Times Square.We had a wonderful stay, and we will tell all our friends of this great hotel.

<Content>The basics with style If you are one of those people that whines about a small hotel room that is otherwise fine, this may not be your place. But if you want a hotel with that is clean, fresh and secure with rooms that include comfy beds, warm strong showers (without ridiculously low shower heads that make you contort just to wash your hair), nice televisions, clean toilets, oversized towells and a mini fridge in every room -- well, this might be your new favorite place since the location and price can't be beat.

<Content>A nightmare - had to flee this place after 6 hours An absolute nightmare. Rude, horrendous interaction - can't possibly call it service from the hotel staff. NO wi-fi was available during my abbreviated stay - had to find and check in to another hotel 6 hours after checking in here since no one knew or cared when wi-fi would be available to guests. Front desk suggested that I do my business work on a paid public kiosk in the checking-in area. While I was checking out - incredibly grateful that I was able to get another room at another hotel with one hour's notice in the middle of the holiday season, a 3-some was checking in for the evening , 2 young men and a young woman - one room. One of the young men went out to the street to attend to parking since as he noted we will only be here for 3 hours. I fled the hotel in relief. I will urge everyone I know to seek alternative accommodation. NOT for business travelers or families or anyone expecting value for their dollar or courteous helpful service.

<Content>Late Night Swimming? Bring your club clothes. We brought our two year old to the hotel without any issues. The room was very quiet (12th floor) and the hotel was great with the kid who definitely loved having a pool to play in during the day (it is usally empty). The breakfasts were great too and we could always find something for him to eat. On Thursday night I thought I might sneak downstairs for a swim after the baby went to bed. I had heard about the partying, but didn't think it was going to be a big deal. I walked out of the elevator with my bathing suit and t-shirt and felt a little out of place with everyone walking around in black suits and fancy dresses. The gym equipment gets moved out of the gym at night so people can party in the gym and sit in the steam room and saunas (turned off). I thought I might strip down to my bathing suit and belly flop into the pool, but I chickened out and went back up to the room.

<Content>Loved Room-Mate Grace! What a great experience we had in NYC! The hotel was hip, fun, funky, affordable and so convenient to Times Square! Our room was very clean, bright, and compact, but had enough room to store our stuff. Great big windows!! The breakfast was healthy and plentiful (more seating and perhaps a time limit is needed though). Pool looked great, as did the steam room.Most of the staff were so friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a no-nonsense, non-traditional stay in the centre of all the action.Thanks for a great visit!

<Content>Customer service brings this excellent hotel to the top The staff would butter your fresh croissants or feed you thefinest blueberries and raspberries while you reclined on one oftheir poolside chaises if you asked. Otherwise ask for an extraface cloth or fix the sound for the TCM channel and they are there before you put the phone back on the hook. Goingto an out of the way restaurant? Then someone at the front deskwill get exact directions for you. Mira checks you in like a firstcousin welcoming you to her house. Oh, and besides thatthe rooms have every amenity that a four or five star hotelwould offer except a towel warmer(can you manage withoutit?). Decor is West Elm or Bo Concepts, all easy on theeye and very functional.

<Content>Great funky hotel in Times Square great funky hotel. The location was great because we were going to the Thanksgiving Day Parade, so the location could not have been better. We always put off going because of the nightmare of geting there in enough time to get a viewing spot. This location was perfect. We awoke at a decent time and we secured a great spot. The property itself is definitely european modern-which may put off some seeking a truly American hotel. However for NYC properties-especially around Times Square- the room was ample size, clean enough and kind of fun. Plus the price was reasonabe-again in relativity. We would definitely stay here again. Mike in CT Air Hogs Zero Gravity Micro

<Content>Excellent! Excellent location, very close to Times Square. Really nice, modern, clean room (a bit on the small side by general american standards, but on the other hand I've sometimes stayed in much smaller rooms in New York City). Great service! Great deal, highly recommended!!

<Content>It was fun! We were in NY to see a show and stayed overnight at the Room Mate Grace on 45th Street. We loved the location so close to Times Square and the Theatre District. The room was nice and very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. We used the Myers parking garage around the block on 46th Street. The hotel will validate your parking receipt when you check out . This cuts the 24 hr parking rate from $50 to $25 dollars. This was our only problem with our stay as we were 15 minutes late getting to the garage for pick- up and were charged an extra $21 dollars. All things considered is was a real nice time had by all.

<Content>Great atmosphere small rooms We loved out stay at the grace, I went to The Grace Hotel with my daughter in search of a college for her and stayed in the Deluxe Bunk rooms (king size bed with a bunk over, it looks much better than it sounds). The location was right in the center of Times SQ very accessible to almost anywhere in Manhattan. The beds were incredibly confortable and clean. The staff was very helpful and always smiling. Bill at the front desk was especially helpful, not to mention had a great sense of humor (that's just hard to find nowadays)!!. Breakfast was delicious. I have already recomended friends to the Grace. Will definitely be coming back!

<Content>Surprisingly Wonderful Stayed here with a friend only one night and wished we could stay longer. I'm a flight attendant and know hotel rooms. This one was terrific. Small hotel rooms is a commonplace concern for New York City but Room Mate Grace utilizes space wonderfully. The bed is tucked into a corner, the bathroom and shower share a sliding door - very smart! Reception was warm and welcoming, our room on the third floor was very quiet - no street noise was discerned at all. The bed was beyond comfortable! Everything was immaculate. The staff treated us with courtesy offering to assist us with every whim and query. Loved the ambiance and setting! Not a bad vibe here at all.Will definately be calling this hotel on my next trip to NYC very soon!

<Content>Pretty great rooms but there could have been better service It was a great hotel as far as room comfort and amenities, but I felt the staff could have been more polite. The ladies at the front desk were short with their words and on the verge of rude. To me, service is what brings me back. I'm not sure I would stay here again. Comfy beds and cool rooms though.

<Content>Enjoyable work trip in the city I was really impressed with the Grace Hotel. Great location, friendly and prompt service, and just a sweet vibe. I enjoyed the continental breakfast and had a fun time hanging out poolside listening to the live DJ with a friend. The room was small, but had everything I wanted: wifi, a comfy bed, even the iHome clock came in very handy. I'd recommend this place to others for sure.

<Content>great service, small and bland rooms, nice breakfast Grace hotel is well located if you want be close to Times Square, Central Park...Service was really good, a lot better than I expected.Rooms are small (and I stayed in a deluxe room), and I thought they would have a nice decoration / feel, but they are really bland, bathroom is ok but ugly...Breakfast was nice, I didn't try the swimming pool, which looks inviting, albeit really small as well.

<Content>great location, our rooms were very small (saw much bigger and lighter rooms) the location was great and the rooms are clean. I didn't like the darkness everywhere. Maybe this is just american. the breakfast was great even fresh fruit. I guess europeans would prefer not to have plastic cups and plates. Our room service was definitely too late (4 pm). I also didn't like that people just came in with their street shoes and clothes, walked with their shoes in teh pool area and went in the pool without having to take the shower. This hotel is not recommendable for families with small children even though they offer rooms with bunk beds. In our room our son could not sit in a corner and play, it was just not one square foot left to play. (maybe we had just bad luck with the size and the darkness of our room) Ask for a bigger room and with more windows.

<Content>Great girlfriends getaway! We were able to get a good deal for this hotel and decided to give it a try. I was not very convinced about the choice, but being 1 out of 3 I agreed to it. Well, let me tell you that I was surprised on how much I liked this place, after all!!! This was the perfect pick for 3 friends going to NYC for four days. We stayed at the four bunk bedroom and it was excellent because each one of us got her own bed and we didn't have to share a bed. We arrived to the hotel around 10:30 and we were able to check in without a problem. The check in-desk is like a kiosk and everybody was extremely helpful. The hotel decor and style is very hip. This is NOT your ordinary chain hotel. The lighting was low and when we arrived to our room on the 4th floor, we found it to be spacious(but not huge) and very clean. The shower was open and the bathroom had a sliding door. Our safe was broken and they sent someone within minutes to fix it. We requested a folding bench for our luggage but we weren't able to get one. Each bed had its own tv, which we found to be very helpful and the bed was super comfortable. The breakfast is included and even thou is nothing extraordinary, it was very helpful to get us started and save us a few bucks. It offered cereal, bagels, croassaints, toasts, fruits, coffee/tea, oj and yougurt. We didn't get to use the pool, but it look very nice. The bar got busy at night and they were hosting martini night, offering $5 martinis. The location was perfect. Closed to Times Square and within walking distance to Central Park, 5th Ave, Empire State, Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick cthedral and subway. We saw lots of couples in their mid-thirties, girlfriends and young families. We really enjoyed staying at Room-mate Grace.

<Content>Nice stay in the heart of time square It's my second time here and I love the room with sofa bed and TV LCD on the bed with ipod connector and dvd players and open space in the bathroom. In this second time here but the staff during night hours are not more friendly like the first time and the employer of the Meyers Parking are not so friendly. Amazing the staff of breakfast time and really clean at all.

<Content>I liked this place - stellar NYC location I booked the Room Mate Grace hotel for one night, as we had a wedding in NYC. Booked through Hotwire for $249/night, when everything else was well over $300/night, so definitely a savings.Location, right off of Times Square on W 45th Street was great. Lobby is super-small and not impressive at all. We got there at 11 am and our room wasn't ready (check-in isn't until 3 pm), but they graciously held our bags so that we could explore the city. At the front desk they offer, for purchase, all sorts of things you can stock the mini-fridge in your room with - beer, soda, wine, snacks, etc...nice convenience.Our room was ready at 1 pm and sure, it was small, but very well designed for its size. We were in Room 509 and faced W 45th Street, but noise was not an issue at all - double insulated windows - so we thankfully didn't hear a thing as we slept. Bed was very comfortable, linens are of fairly high quality. There is a small plasma TV right in front of the bed which was perfectly adequate. The bathroom is a bit odd, with a sliding door between the shower and toilet area, so you can't have the shower door and the door to the toilet closed at the same time, because there's only one door, but it was clean and functional (and hey, this was only for one night.) Shower pressure was decent and liked the rain-forest shower head. Mini-fridge, iron and ironing board, as well as a hair dryer are all provided. The only thing I didn't like was a cheap set of plastic drawers for your clothes next to the sink/fridge set-up. I think they could do better than that, looks like something for about $10 from Wal-mart. There is no room service, but they do provide menus for ordering in from local restaurants.Breakfast in the am, which is included in the room price, was very decent, continental style, on the 2nd floor. Muffins, toast, crossiants, bagels, fresh fruit, cereal, hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, juice and coffee were offered. Great coffee, by the way. The staff was constantly replenshing, which was great. The indoor pool is something else. Located right in the lobby, and accessible by the 2nd floor, it is small, with a swim-up bar that opens at 5 pm. This is not a pool for small kids. There are a couple of steam rooms and a gym as well within close proximity of the pool. It turns into a club at night with young (think under 30's) splashing in their suits, drinking martinis and grooving to the DJ. Only in NYC! It seemed to be quite the scene. When we got back from our wedding at 1:30 am, it was still going strong. We were tired, but thankfully, we could not hear the downstairs noise at that time. I'd stay at the Room Mate Grace again without question. It is not a fancy hotel, so if you are looking for a grand hotel experience with a sprawling lobby and extra amenities, this isn't your place. But for a well-located, boutique-style, solid 3-star hotel with clean, quiet rooms and comfortable beds in NYC at a decent NYC price, you can't go wrong.

<Content>PERFECT for the SINGLE TRAVELER Hotel Grace exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend a stay if you are traveling alone. Being a single traveler, my Petite accommodations suited my needs perfectly. The bed was COMFY and COZY with ample storage space to stash my belongings. The bathroom was clean and provided the essentials. The shower and toilet shared a sliding door which I thought was clever, but unusual if I had a companion. The free wi-fi access made staying in touch EASY and CONVENIENT. The daily complimentary breakfast was absolutely wonderful--offering a good selection of items to get me filled up for the long walks in the city. The environment had a relaxed vibe--ambient lighting and smooth grooves. The night scene at the pool was ECSTATIC. Try GRACE--she's PERFECT.

<Content>Good Euro Vibe and Great Location Room Mate Grace has an awesome location in Times Square. The front desk crew is very helpful and really worked to get us an awesome place in the Village for dinner upon our late friday night arrival. The only bummer is that the owner held private parties both friday and saturday night so we could not use the bar and there was no DJ there either. Upon checkout they did apologize and say that this was unusual. The breakfast is quite tasty. Our room had lots of windows and good views. Loved the walk in shower too. The bed was comfy, however they need to put in a towel bar though in the bathroom. And, the plasma TV was nice but small. Loved the euro feel and vibe incl. the 'funky wall paper' on the 10th floor. Anyway, we will be back again! I like the newsstand at the checkin too. Oh, and the bag check on the last day was very helpful so we could completely enjoy the city for the day. Solid place to stay especially if you are a fan of modern living.

<Content>Loved Room Mate Grace Great style. Great customer service. Clean rooms with just enough ammenities. Very comfortable bed. Soft towels. Thanks for having a hair dryer since NYC was hit by a torrential downpour that I got stuck in! Cool bar area. Stayed here for a business trip. Excellent variety  freshness of continental breakfast. Would definitely consider staying at Room Mate Grace next time I am in NYC as well as other Room Mate properties around the world....for business as well as pleasure travel. Excellent discovery recommended to me by two coworkers (unbeknownst to each other) and glad I made the reservation. Thanks!

<Content>We loved Grace A great hotel, near the Times Square, and 5th avenue. Rooms are very nice and quiet, and all people are very relaxed and friendly. Our new favourite hotel in NY, for our next NY-trip.

<Content>Absolutely superb, a real find I cannot reccomend this hotel enough. We stayed 28 Aug - 2 Sept 2008.It is incredibly clean, our room was upgraded to the 15th floor as it was my daughters 16th birthday. Its location is excellent. The downstairs pool/bar is a cool vibe playing great chilled/funky music but not too much that it disturbs being a hotel guest if the music is not your thing. I have already reccommended this to 3 groups who are going to new york by the end of the year.Its appraisal of the rooms is 100% true. Small but so well designed it never occurs to you that they are slightly small. and to be honest they arent that small compared to other new york hotel rooms.As we checked out they were starting some building work in the lobby - not sure the extent but might be worth checking if you are staying in Sept 08.My only slight gripe is that when you ring the hotel to speak to guests or management the phone is not answered very quickly and there is a lot of waiting on hold which is expensive if its a transatlantic callNone the less, we cannot fault this hotel and will definately use the chain again,

<Content>Good experience Enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Upon checkin, we were upgraded to a bigger room - without asking, done by the front clerk simply because it was available. Front desk contains small bottles of various drinks - alcoholic and non-alcoholic and snacks for sale. Bed very comfortable, shower great - but could have used a bathroom door! Complimentary breakfast was very good. Great location if you are coming into town for a play, within walking distance.

<Content>Our stay was absolutely amazing! Our stay at Room-Mate Grace was incredible. The hotel itself was clean and modern, we very much enjoyed the unique room layouts - which were perfect for our needs. In New York city you are not spending very much time in your room other than to shower and sleep. The beds and linens were the most comfortable I have ever been in - and if the hotel could send us some for a wedding present, that would be great! Kidding. The whole experience was wonderful - the staff (in particular Nick the overnight guy) were exceptional and the atmosphere fun but invitiing. Wading into the pool after a very long day filled with a heck of a lot of walking was well deserved and needed. The only criticism we had was the pool should have been much warmer - it was really cold the last couple of nights there.Thanks so much for the unforgettable trip - We couldn't have asked for more!

<Content>Good Choice Room Mate Grace, despite the unusual name, is an excellent choice for a hotel in the Theatre District. Half a block from Times Square, it is nonetheless exceptionally quiet, at least on the upper floors. The lobby is unimpressive and the poorest part of the experience, but you don't book a hotel for its lobby. We were initially booked into a tiny room - you could not access the bed without hitting the TV. After a request, we were relocated to a terrific room, twice the size, at the same cost.The platform beds may be a bit difficult to access for older folks or those with some disabilities. Fabulously comfortable, though.Free WiFi. Excellent continental breakfast with REAL espresso. Friendly and helpful staff. Pool, exercise room, sauna and steam room for those so inclined. Can't ask for much more!

<Content>Nice but Understaffed This Times Square hotel staffs 2 receptionists for 139 highly priced rooms. One receptionist called out so we waited in line over 20 minutes for service. The pool area and lounge cater to a younger crowd, which was nice. The place was small but chic - the standard room beds were surrounded by an awkward bench-like border, which makes throwing someone on the bed more of a toss. No rooms have a view of anything but an ugly street and pipes.The complimentary breakfast was very nice 7-12. The shower's were excellent. Fantastic weekend.

<Content>Great value for Times Square I loved the modern look and feel of the room, with the white ostrich leather benches surrounding the beds. The bathroom had a neat design to it to.I also really appreciated the pool area, which was just fun. There was a DJ and a screen with lights projected onto it in the pool area. Lots of people having fun and partying. The bar area was just around the corner.The breakfast was good too. I totally want one of those granditalia x11 espresso makers, but they cost tons and tons. Anyways, I'm impressed that they had a high quality espresso maker in the breakfast bar -- that's highly unusual at any hotel.

<Content>LOVED IT!! This was our first time in New York and I don't think we could have picked a BETTER hotel! The service was amazing (Tim at reception was the BEST!!!), the rooms were great, breakfast was perfect....I have nothing bad to say about it :o) And being that this was our first time in New York it was all about location and the location was perfect! We'll definately be going back.

<Content>Funky hotel right in Times Square the Room Mate Grace is a pretty interesting little place just one half block from Times Square. Definitely good for first-time visitors because you are right in the heart of a lot of touristy things. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the room was quiet with a comfortable bed that was up on a platform of sorts. I'd never seen anything quite like that! They have a funky little pool that overlooks the bar. There are also a few rows of stadium style benches that overlook the pool and a giant TV screen. That was a little random and at 1am looked a bit like a scene from a reality TV show with lots of young hipsters.If you are a regular visitor to NYC or arriving by car you may want to stay a little farther away from Times Square :)

<Content>Great Location, Cool Hotel We've just got back from New York and enjoyed our 2nd stay at the Room Mate Grace (formerly the QT Hotel). It's still a great hotel in a perfect mid-town location next to Times Square.Two problems we did have - the online form we used did not transmit our booking to the hotel, which we later found out when email the hotel about our arrival - they had no record of our booking! The other slight down-side is the breakfast area is quite small and always busy, so it can be hard to find a table. Best to take a tray back up to your room we found!It was a good stay but it wasn't particulary cheep at $329 per night for a very 'cosy' room. Luckily the bed was great.

<Content>Awesome hotel I really love the hotel, ultra modern, clean, just great. The only things I can say about the room that could use improvement is the bathroom. It has a sliding door that closes off the toilet or the shower which is pretty cool but there is no door to the bathroom which is not cool. We had our 12 year old cousin with us and you cannot come out of the shower with being fully seen by everyone in the room. A little weird. We called the closet the changing room since it was the only private place in the room. The other glitch I felt was there wasn't anywhere to hang a towel near the shower or in it so we had to lay the towel on the floor. I can still say this is the coolest hotel I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in quite a few. Thanks for a great stay.

<Content>Loved it when it was Hotel QT and love it now that it's Room Mate Grace I know it may be silly to like a hotel based on the free breakfast but it's so convenient and delicious. There was even fresh berries for your yogurt! The pool, sauna and steam room are huge perks, but the fluffy bedding lulls me to sleep after a busy day.

<Content>We loved it! The hotel is cute and we loved our staying! The only however is that the room is small, so if you like big rooms, you won't like it at all. We booked a standard room and got an upgrade to a larger room, but still was small. As we do not care about big rooms, we loved it! It was perfec for us (a couple without children). The people at the desk was very helpul and friendly. They made lots of reservations for us and gave lots of recommendations, always in a very good mood. The breakfast was great too. We definitely recommend this hotel. The relation cost/benefit was the best we could get!!! A lot of very good things at a very low cost. The location was perfect too. A few steps from time square and from the store Toy r us. Just a block to the subway.

<Content>My Favorite Hotel The Hotel Grace is an oasis in the middle of Times Square. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms are attractive, comfortable, clean, and quiet. Plus, on a hot day, what can beat a refreshing dip in the pool?

<Content>An amazing hotel in NYC!!! We spent 4 nights at the Roommate Grace Hotel in New York and absolutely loved it! The hotel, located in the heart of Midtown, is well situated close to many attractions - Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, the Met, MoMA, among others. But its location is not its best feature. We loved the design of the hotel and our room. It is very modern and funky. While small, our room was so well designed that it functioned far better than a regular hotel room. We had ample room to unpack clothes in the closet and store our luggage under our platform bed. The bed itself was amazing; it was so comfortable and had great linens. The bathroom was spacious; the vanity opened into the bedroom but the shower and the toilet were self-contained. Everything was very modern in design. Breakfast was included with our room and served in the 2nd floor lounge. Cereals, fruit, yogurt, bagels, toast, eggs, croissants and muffins were offered daily along with juice, coffee, tea and hot chocolate. A small pool is located off the lobby and has a swim-up bar. The hotel staff are amazing. We always found everyone to be extremely helpful. We arrived in New York at 8:30 a.m. and were immediately given a room. Had a room not been available, they would have happily stored our luggage as they did the day we left but before we caught our flight out. The front desk staff upgraded our room as well! When asking for directions, subway help or restaurant recommendations, they were always ready and willing to help.Without hesitation, I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to New York and would most certainly stay there again.

<Content>Room Mate Grace Hotel - Best 'Room Mate' in NYC My boyfriend and I just returned from a 3 night stay at Hotel Grace. Both having traveled to NYC previously and stayed in various hotels spanning different price points (The Royalton, Doubletree Lexington and Hotel Solita) we are both very happy with Hotel Grace in virtually every aspect. Hotel location is prime - midtown location, steps from Times Square, Broadway, Park Ave, Madison Ave and subway stops. Rooms - if this is your first stay in NYC you may be shocked to find the rooms small in size but comparing to the other rooms we've stayed in the room size was pretty status quo. Comfortable beds, super clean (I am picky about cleanliness, let's just say obsessive compulsive) bed linens, floors, mirrors, sinks, all of it - SPOTLESS. Decor - modern, minimalist. Perfect for room size. Flat screen tv, IPOD dock/alarm radio; fridge where you can actually store your personal food and bevvies. Closet space sufficient with enough hangers and even a mini drawer for storing socks, belts and accessories. Staff - helpful, knowledgeable of the area. Some of the check-in staff could be a tad more friendly but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and chocking it up to the person having a bad day. The hotel caters, in my opinion, to a young adult crowd. In the evenings the hotel lobby bar and pool area are busy with patrons (aged 21-30), Top 40 music. Having said this there are plenty of restaurants, pubs and venues in the area so guests are not without options. Cab fare to most major boroughs approx $12. Continental breakfast - consists of variety of cereals, breads, fruits, coffee/tea, juices. Quality products. Value - as mentioned previously, having stayed at various hotels at different price points, this hotel is definitely the best value NYC hotel.  ** The smell that people have mentioned in other reviews - quite simply, the hotel has a pool, sauna and steam room, clearly there will be a chemical smell associated with these ammenities. Hardly disgusting and definitely does not permeate throughout the hotel. Moot point.Hope this review helps! Enjoy NYC.

<Content>Amazing Hotel! Room Mate Grace (previously Hotel QT) was excellent! It changed ownership to Room Mate on the day we arrived but everything went very smoothly at check in. The reception staff were all very friendly and very helpful.The hotel is seconds from Times Square and most attractions are in walking distance.The rooms were big with very comfortable beds and chic decor. The hotel bar and pool looked great but we didn't have the chance to use them!The breakfast was basic but good!Would definitely stay again!

<Content>Perfect Location, So Comfy! My husband and I were celebrating our one year anniversary in New York this July and decided we wanted to find a unique, modern hotel for our stay. Not only was the Grace hotel unique and modern but it was so accomodating! The beds were so comfortable unlike most hotels and the shower was divine! We had problems with our A/C and the maintenance was there within 2 minutes to repair it. He decided that it was not a quick fix so they moved us to the suite free of charge for the inconvenience! The location is incredible, right on the edge of times square. The free breakfast was perfect and we appreciated the free wifi to check our email and plot where we were going to visit in the city. We plan on staying at the Grace Hotel every time we visit New York.

<Content>Consistently friendly staff Hotel Grace Exceeded our expectations in so many ways.1. From the beginning the hotel was very accomodating with our early check-in. 2. Very quiet hallways and rooms.3. Loved the bathroom - a big shower, nice fridge to keep cold drinks and lots of counter space. We also really appreciated the fluffy towels and large mirrors too.4. The beds and pillows were super comfortable and the linens were nice.5. The continental breakfast was delicious. It was the perfect place to get some real food while on vacation (yogurt, great fruit, bagels, bread, croissants, real orange juice (not Sunny D), and a fantastic choice of coffee. The breakfast made our day and we really appreciated the long availability of it. 6. What we noticed and appreciated the most was the consistency of the competant staff working at the hotel. From the front desk (24 hours) to someone to hail a cab early one morning, to the guy serving breakfast and the cleaning staff. All were very personable, knowledgeable and professional.7. For the price, coupled with the location and quality of the hotel this hotel was the best of the three hotels we stayed in while on vacation in NYC.8. We liked the idea of staying at a hotel with a pool. Late at night the pool turns into a bit of a pick up place by the looks of it. We didn't use the pool for this reason, but again - really loved that it could be used 24 hours a day.9. We would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay steps from many NY attractions, with all the comforts of home.While the rooms were well sized the platform that the bed was on took up much of the space of the floor. This is not for someone who has any physical limitations - climbing up on and getting off the bed can be tricky - even for this fit twenty-something aged person.Definately, this hotel knows what it is doing. We happily recommend this to everyone.

<Content>Fun fun fun in the theater district I stayed at the Grace on business, checking in the Friday night before an early-morning seminar. Nonetheless, I wanted to get a little socializing in that night, and the hotel provided a great environment to do that in thanks to the pool and swim-up bar. It was lively but not crowded, and though somewhat small the adjoining steam room and sauna more than made up for it.The hotel as a whole is very modern and interestingly designed; only the hotel rooms show their age slightly in the drab, bare walls and exposed pipes, and even then the platform bed and the bathroom (fear not, it DOES have a door - a panel slides back and forth to cover the shower or toilet from view) made up for that. The whole hotel was VERY lively, and the rooms... less than soundproof. Still, despite the noise, I didn't have much of a problem dropping off to sleep on account of the comfy bed.The array of goodies for sale at the reception desk capped it off as a good, convenient place for a weary traveler to have a little fun. The Grace would be perfect for a leisure visit to NY, but even as a business stopover I very much recommend it.

<Content>Lived Up To Expectations I will be repeating 99% of the reviews of this Hotel. Staff, room, pool, bar, buffet breakfast, location were all fantastic. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The main clientele were aged between 20-40year olds, but I didn't feel out of place celebrating my 50th, (with a complimentary half bottle of champagne). Will most certainly return - the whole experience was memorable. Margaret-Scotland

<Content>Hotel QT We stayed at the Hotel QT whilst in NYC to get married (we eloped!). The first thing that strikes you is the very central location - a block away from Times Square. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful through out our stay, and we were given a complimentary bottle of champagne on our wedding day, which was a nice touch.We were first given a room on the 6th floor which was very oddly shaped and you walked through the door virtually into the bathroom. I returned to the reception/kiosk and asked for a second room. We were given a room on the 10th floor which was fine, except for the noise of construction work dircetly outside (stated at 6.30am!). We probably would have put up with this, but not for our wedding trip. I went to reception and was immediately upgraded to a suite on 15th floor. The suite was fantastic - one wall was entirely glass and you could see parts of Times Square through the buildings, it had a double shower and a huge bed on a platform. We would definately return to Hotel QT.

<Content>Loved it after starting out at 6th floor walkup! I was traveling to NYC with my 16yr old daughter, an aspiring model. Our arrangements were made by a top model agency and initially we were put up in a 6th floor walkup sublet for us. Aside from the lack of elevator, the sheets and towels were dirty and there was one double bed for the 2 of us. After complaining to the agency, we were moved to the Hotel QT. I have never been so happy to see clean sheets and towels in my life! Our first experience probably made the QT more enjoyable for us because some of the things others have complained about did not bother us. The bed was so comfortable and large enough for two - very soft sheets and great pillows. Lots of amenities in the room which although small was manageable. There was a lot of construction noise which would normally annoy the heck out of me but we had early starts every morning anyway. The continental breakfast was very convenient - my only complaint is that they ran out of bananas midweek and wouldn't get any more til Saturday - why??? I loved being able to get my own latte's from the espresso machine whenever I wanted.My daughter tried the fitness room and complained that there were only reclining bicycles which were extremely noisy. The location just half a block off Times Square was very convenient also. I

<Content>Fun Factor Fades Fast I've stayed here four times now, recently two weeks ago. The QT, with it's tiny rooms, is fun and charming when it's cheap ( $200/night) but the charm fades fast when it costs $100/night more than that. The 7am jackhammer next door didn't help (this empty lot may be an ongoing construction project, not sure).I still like the QT, but if it's going to stay competitive at it's current rates they need to upgrade a bit. Here are a few of the things my room needed: some kind (any kind!) of towel hook or rack; better place for your clothes than a few cheap plastic drawers, a thermometer control for the heating/AC that works, bathrobes, more staff at breakfast.

<Content>Not that great...actually not very good at all I think this hotel is over rated and my overall stay was unsatisfactory. Unfortunately there was construction happening next door to the hotel which meant we were woken each morning by a jack hammer at 6.30am on week days. This admittedly is out of the hotel's control and just bad luck but we also had the room next to us playing their techno music so loud we could hear it clearly through the walls (even WITH the jack hammer in the background).The pool in the lobby is a quirky (some might say 'cool') feature but the unglamourous reality of it is that you can smell the overpowering scent of chlorine through out the hotel: in the lobby, in the breakfast room while having breakfast etc. which is not pleasant.Perhaps most importantly is that the Hotel QT is not cheap. For a supposedly reasonably priced boutique hotel it cost us $340 a night ($388 inclusive of all the taxes) for a twin bed room per night. And we stayed for 9 nights! With all the problems we had I will go elsewhere next time I'm in New York. With the rate we were charged I really feel we could've got more for our money elsewhere.Lastly, I know that some people prefer to stay in midtown in the centre of things but Times Square is heaving with crowds of mostly tourists 24/7. After getting to know New York better during my vacation the areas of Soho, Greenich Village  the east side with their great shops, cool boutiques and restaurants are more appealing locales to stay in the city whilst still being central.

<Content>Perfect! We booked this hotel through Mr  Mrs Smith so we knew it would be good  we weren't disappointed.Location - The hotel is in a fab location just one street away from Times Square, so you're close to everything but it was also a lot quieter than we expected.Staff - ALL the staff were lovely, very friendly  helpful. They helped get us taxis when we were in a hurry  reserved a table for us at the Russian Tea Rooms (if you want to go to the Plaza, book in advance - we couldn't get in unfortunately!)Room - the room was great, bigger than we expected. The bed as a lot of people have said already was v. comfortable  had great sheets too, loads of wardrobe space, massive shower, v.well equipped - safe, TV, DVD player, iPod dock, fridge, hairdryer, iron  ironing board. It was v. cold when we were there so it was great we had control of the stat too.Facilities - the pool, gym, sauna  steam room all looked great but we were so busy sightseeing we never got chance to use them. The shop in the lobby was v. well stocked with drinks, snacks, magazines etc. The bar (open til 1) was great, we had some lovely  v.strong cocktails. The hotel transforms into a nightclub in the evening with DJs  people in the pool (using the swim-up bar) and this is our only criticism of the place - it had a strange mix of tourists (like us!) and wannabes posing in / around the pool, the latter made it feel a bit like a swingers convention some nights! Food - it was great staying in a NY hotel where breakfast is included, as it gives you a chance to wake up properly before joining the chaos outside. Lovely continental breakfast - croissants, muffins, bagels, yogurts, fruit, cereals, juice, tea  coffee. The take-away menus in our room looked v. appealing too, but we ate out all the time we were there.Value - we stayed over Easter when loads of other hotels were coming up at crazy prices, this was excellent value, especially considering the location.We loved NY and this hotel  will be recommending it to our friends  family and hope to return one day ourselves too.

<Content>Too hip for its own good They try. They really try. But the Hotel QT's insistence on being hip gets in its way.The good: Great location. Tiny room, but that's why they call it a boutique hotel. Clean. I hear that breakfast is included, but since it's served starting at 7am, I had to miss it to make an 8am train. The young woman at the front desk was friendly and helpful, although she sent me to a non-existent restaurant. Oh well. It happens. Nevertheless, these are true strong points.But, when the designers had to choose between being functional or hip, they went for hip every time. For example, the shower head in my room was stylish. About a foot across, it hung directly above me. Very pretty. But, a foot-wide shower head disperses whatever water pressure it gets. As a result, you can't really shampoo your hair in it (especially if you have more hair than I do, which let's hope you do). And because it's fixed above you, you can't rinse the downward-facing parts of your body. Ahem.Not to mention that the shower area (an open part of the open bathroom -- very hip, unless you're rooming with someone you don't want to strip in front of) has an outside window as one wall. The window is frosted ... but only halfway up. Why oh why do the QT's designers think we all want to show off our nakedness to the building across the street?Likewise, the bed is on a platform with a lip jutting out. Since the rooms are not all that well lei, and because I am a klutz (all part of not being hip), I kept barking my shins on it. Just another example of a design decision made with hipness rather than functionality in mind.if stark, clean lines matter to you more than being able to take a good shower in a private room, then you will genuinely enjoy this hotel. But, either it is too hip or I am not hip enough, so the bottom line is that next time I'm going to look elsewhere.

<Content>Great NY Hotel A stay at the QT Hotel in New York City is something else. You enter straight in to a front desk / convience store while youre eyes wander towards the pool that is located center lobby right next to the elevators. Innovation and the guts to do something totally different in a hotel are obvious and a wonderfull change for a frequent traveller. Located right off Times Square at a rate around 250 dollars it must be best deal in New York. The rooms are smaller than you average hotel room but the lay out is great and you miss nothing in your room. The bed, the ipod docking station and the bathrooom are all premiere quality. Stay at the QT next time in New York , buisness or leisure you wont be disappointet

<Content>LOVED IT My husband, myself and my daughter decided to take a day trip to NYC to see the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum in Times Square. We were having so much fun in NY that we decided to stay. At dinner we asked the bartender where we might find a room and he recommended the QT. From the moment we were greeted at the front door, until the time we checked out, the QT was quite an adventure.Walking into the lobby, we were greeted by 3 doormen and the reservation clerk. All extra friendly, good looking people. We were astonished that we could get a room with a King Size Bed and a single bed loft for under $300.00. We were checked in within 15 mins. On our way upstairs we passed the pool which was immaculate and noticed there was a bar there. Elevator was quick and clean and our room was beautiful! Clean, comfy and modern.After washing up we left and went to Little Italy and shopping and then returned. The Hotel was a party! People swimmng and laughing in the pool, music playing...it was alive! We loved it. My daughter who is a very impressionable 16 year old wanted to look around and we did. People were friendly, the door man knew and recognized us and we felt completely safe among the crowd. Security was excellent, the bed was comfortable and clean, huge shower, refrigerator, dvd player, just wonderful. Me and my daughter are returning next week to see a play and will be staying at the QT. I must say, that most important when travelling with my daughter is not walking into an empty lobby. I feel completely safe taking her there and staying a few days alone.Hats off to the QT. The atmosphere is just like the world outside its doors in Time Square. Alive, friendly, happy and comfortable. LOVED IT.

<Content>QT (Quite Terrific) The QT has all you need for a perfect stay in NY. Superb location, comfortable well equipped rooms, complimentary breakfast and great amenities. First off, location - right on the door step of Times Square and within easy walking distance of so many other landmarks too.We checked in about 3pm on a Saturday and found the service to be friendly and efficient. Same at checkout.Our room had a king sized bed with the most comfortable mattress I think I've ever slept on (well appreciated after a hard day/night pounding the pavements of NY). The room was well serviced every day with fresh towels and complementary toiletries.We only had time to make use of the pool/steam room once but it was blissfully rejuvenating, especially as the weather outside was pretty cold.Just one small negative - building work going on next door, which was quite noisy at times and looks like it is just starting out. Woke us Monday morning at 7am, however after that one day,it didn't start until 8.30ish by which time we were up anyway and by the time we'd returned the workers had gone home. Don't let it put you off - NY is a noisy place anyway!

<Content>Good value You can't beat the location of the QT. While the room was quite small, the bathroom was expansive (I had a corner room). No frills, but clean and modern. Continental breakfast is included and makes this midtown Manhattan hotel quite a good value.

<Content>QT? NT... QT? No Thanks.I feel very churlish with my one dot, but I'm left with little alternative. To me, the best thing about QT was the ease at which I could book it online and the friendliness of the emails that I recieved before arrival.The problems started on arrival. The staff I found (with the exception of one) extremely stand-offish (moreso than your average NYer who invariably warms up after thick-skinned persistent efforts to engage in friendly banter!) and entirely unhelpful. The attitude started when I arrived early and they kept (to the second) to a 2pm check-in. Tick: unflexible. The lobby reminded me of your local YMCA complete with chlorine stench that permeated throughout the bottom floors of the hotel. The concept of a pool is great, the practicalities less so. Tick: stinky and remniscent of embarrassing days pulling at your flowery swimsuit in front of class mates aged 5.Also on the ground floor lobby, the check-in desk was more like a small newsagent kiosk (which it basically was): concept, you do everything yourself (buy magazines, water, remote control batteries (more of that in a minute) there). Requests to recommend/book a restauraunt or indeed any other general asistance you may ask for were met with a look bordering on (in quick succession): shock, horror and resentment.The lift was an experience in itself. When the lift doors did open the dark corridor was bathed in a hazy red light, a sort of montage of such movie comforters as Psycho and Dressed to Kill (but set in a brothel). Scary stuff.The room was, I will say, great fun. Bunk beds! Freezing lower bed by window (issue with seals I think) and the top bed was like a night in the fiery pits of hell. It was so hot up there (she points fearfully) that the metal ladder getting up was scorching. Also, the remote didn't work (even after I went to the kiosk to collect batteries. Twice). Room service? What room service: you get a pile of take-out menus and order yourself. This means that you have a warm glow inside, safe in the knowledge that unchecked psychopaths from the local takeaway (or whereever) are traipsing about the corridors looking like extras in said Psycho or Dressed to Kill. So lock your doors. For drinks (including alcoholic): you head to your trusty kiosk and for a mere 10 dollars and a face that looks like a bulldog chewing a wasp, you get a tin of luke warm diet coke. I won't mention how much the fizz cost.  Finally, the in-room loo. Oh, the loo. And the shower. Our room had no separate loo: like a UK studio flat (except without the separate room for the loo). The actual loo is situated behind a wall to preserve the visual (but not audio) modesty. The shower is covered only by a curtain (not the area leading to it), so if you didn't live in a naked house and you are sharing with someone who does not regularly see you naked, you must dart (watching not to slip and crack head on the cute mosiac titles - what a way to go) furtively behind the shower curtain while your cohabitee is bashing the remote control on the table, ordering take out.Always one to accentuate the positive: it meant that we got the most of my favourite city and rarely spent more than 20 minutes a day there!Devasting review, but I hated the place. Cutie idea, but poorly executed. QT will remain just that for me...

<Content>Pretty much lives up to expectations Stayed for 8 days just before Christmas in a very nice corner room with a view of Times Square. Double bed up on a platform, so slightly awkward, but great to lounge and look at the lights.Room facilities excellent: comfortable bed, excellent linen, good functional bathroom although weak water pressure, iPod player/alarm, DVD, good TV, fridge that you can stock, good storage. Well above what you'd expect for the price in a city centre hotel (be it London, Paris etc) and very attractive style, if sepulchral corridors and common areas. Complimentary continental breakfast perfect. Pool a bit bizarre (particularly the pool smell that you greets you at breakfast) but I suppose I'm showing my age. Deli down the street for stocking up or coffee/snacks that you can bring to your room, although temporarily closed by NY Hygiene when we were there! Hotel also fine with take outs delivered to room. Excellent location for 5th Ave shopping, museums (MoMA, Int Centre of Photo), restaurants and especially plays Broadway or off Broadway. 42nd St/Time Sq subway adjacent but Times Sq insanely busy to fight your way through.Downtown locations (SoHo etc) might be cuter - Midtown all go.Nice staff, does exactly what you'd imagine as a hotel. Not an upmarket hostel, as some reviewers seem to imagine. Actually much better equipped and with more style than many so-called superior hotels.

<Content>The QT is Fantastic My boyfriend and I stayed at the QT between Dec 18th and Dec 23rd during our winter getaway to New York. Our taxi driver from JFK found our hotel very easily (the ride took about 40 mins ($53 inc. tip and toll)). We entered the hotel and approached the front desk/kiosk and were greeted by a kind lady who swiftly wished us a happy anniversary (my boyfriend and I also celebrating our 3rd year together). As we completed our check-in, I requested to buy a bottle of water and it was given to me for free(I love free stuff!) The receptionist also upgraded our room and stuck to all of the guidelines we provided on our booking (i.e. room on high floor to avoid street noise). When we went out for a few hours, on our return we found that the hotel staff were kind enough to leave in our a room an anniverary card, chocolate,and some alcohol to celebrate. We were pleasantly surprised by the design of our room (it was minimalist and cleverly desined).Becasue the QT does not have its own restaurant, in the room portfolio(provided in each room), we found menus for local restaurants which deliver (from Mexican to Italian to Chinese to Sushi). The tv had about 40 channels (although we were out most of the time), and the room was equipped with a dvd player, minifridge and ice box to stock up using the ice machine in each hallway.The breakfast was divine(!): Fresh bagels, eggs, muffins, yogurt orange juice, and array of teas, coffee etc. etc.Re location: couldnt be more perfect! We were literally steps from Times Square (exact location W 5th and Broadway)! Within 10 mins walk from the hotel is MTV Studios, all Broadway shows, 42nd Street Subway (one stop/4mins from 34th Street where you can find Macy's!), 5th Ave.(remember that Broadway is actually 7th Ave and so all the major shopsare just two Avenues down), Port Authority Bus Station (where you can get a bus directly to Woodbury Common Factory Shopping Outlet), and Restaurants such as Junior's for their legendary cheescake!Overall, this was a fantastic hotel. We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to any of our friends visiting the city in the future. The only thing that has stopped me from giving this hotel a full 5/5 is the fact that the indoor pool  pool bar (which looked so inviting) was unavailable to hotel guests for most of our visit due to parties being held by external business. This is the only thing that has stopped me from giving Hotel QT a full score of 5/5.Tips: To save money, buy a 7-day metro card which allow you anywhere on the Metro system. Also, there are plenty of delis between 5th Ave and Broadway, where you can get hot food as well as salads on the cheap for dinner.

<Content>Amazing Hotel QT is a very nice hotel in a very good place. Close to Time Square and Theatre District. The rooms are cleaness and cozy. The linen and the bed are very confortable. I recommend this place if you want to be near a Time Square.

<Content>NY's best kept secret This is a terrific hotel giving a very good value for the money. I wanted to show my sister NY, and had a heck of a time finding a room between Thanksgiving and Christmas that I didn't have to sell a kidney to pay for. People at my company told me that this hotel was a good one. They were right. Rooms are on the small side, but so well designed it's not really noticeable. The room my sister and I stayed in had big windows that filled it with light. Mattress was a Sealy, and very, very comfortable, with soft sheets and a down comforter. The biggest surprise was the continental breakfast, in an attractive dining room. Three different cereals, hard boiled eggs, lattes, expressos, or coffees, fresh squeezed orange juice and yougurt, fresh bagels -- what a great breakfast, thrown in for free with the room. c\Couple that with the location off Times Square, and honestly, it's NY's best kept secret. Only thing I really didn't like was the hallway to the room -- seriously dark and a little forboding. But, that's a small enough criticism.

<Content>Beware nighttime construction noise next door I just left after a week at the QT, where I've stayed many times. As others have commented, there is much to recommend it:O the location is wonderful (a half-block east of Times Square)O the staff are pleasant and helpfulO the beds are comfyO the free breakfast is excellent -- REAL croissants, bagels, muffins, along with hard-boiled eggs, cereals, yogurt, etc.O there is a hi-tech espresso machine, available 24 hrs a day, that makes reasonably good espresso, lattes, and cappucinos (decaf and regular)HOWEVER, there is construction under way next door to the hotel; it looks as though a building will soon be going up where there used to be a parking lot. But the noise is not during normal construction hours: It lasted from approximately midnight until dawn, apparently because trucks can't get through (or aren't permitted to) during the day. The noise wasn't constant, but I was awakened from time to time by clanking (steel beams being unloaded?), and didn't enjoy restful sleep all week.It's probably a good idea to ask about the construction when making a reservation.A few recommendations near the QT: O Orso Italian restaurant -- Like the QT, right in the heart of the theater district; excellent, reasonably-priced, charming placeO John's Pizzeria -- justifiably renowned pizza and FABULOUS baked ziti. Quite cheap, pleasant ambiance (it's a converted church), but noisy. A couple of blocks from the QT.O DB Bistro Moderne -- not cheap, but superb modern bistro food; owned by chef Daniel Boulud. A couple of blocks from the QT.O Tang Pavilion -- about a 20-minute walk from the QT, just off 5th Avenue near the Plaza Hotel, FAO Schwartz, etc. Amazingly cheap, excellent Chinese (esp. Shangai-style) food in a superb location.

<Content>Chic and central Great location if you're looking for somewhere central. The lobby, bar and pool are all very chic. Our room was a decent size (we went for a B room) with an incredibly comfortable bed. The decor was very boutique hotel and simple. My only complaint is the fact that the bathrooms are integrated into the rooms leaving little privacy for sharers. We were on the 6th floor and the background noise of Midtown Manhattan is very loud and constant.Generally the service was great though when I called to sak for replacement batteries for the tv remote (jet lag meant a night in was required) I didn't get a response all night. A note left for the cleaner the next day received an immediate response.All in all a great hotel, reasonably price in a very central location.

<Content>Cool QT This hotel was so fun and so cool. Of course I rated it based on what it is and aspires to be, not as compared to the Ritz Carlton or somewhere like that. The QT is a light, playful, somewhat edgy boutique hotel in the heart of Times Square that is an amazing value for the money. You could easily pay double what we did and get some gross, stuffy monstrosity, so I thought this was an amazing find. The rooms are small-ish, but not too horrible by New York standards. The downstairs pool-area is really hopping at night, but it is a very young-ish party scene to be sure. That isn't our scene at all and we still loved the hotel. And there were other fun loving people like us in their forties we saw at breakfast. Highly recommended.

<Content>Would be great with a little tweaking Location: Perfect. You are steps from the middle of Times Square.Personnel: very friendly, not snooty or affected at all, as some reviews have stated.Other Guests: A very european crowd. Room: Small, but it was fun to see how they utilized space. If you think something major is missing, make sure you search for it. Light switches have dimmers-little toggles on the side of switch. shower was not that great - NO water pressure. Some people mentioned there was no toilet area door - there was a pocket door tucked into the wall in our room. They had Kiss my Face shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. They have hairdryers. Our room had a little refrigerator which you could stock with things you buy down at the front desk. the bed was VERY comfortable. Don't expect a view.Problems: when we walked in our room, it was registering 85 degrees. Sweltering. we told the front desk when we left. when we returned it was registering below 70, which was fine with us. BUT, in the middle of the night, something happened and it was registering 85 again when we woke up. we called maintenance and something was done without entering our room, seems suspicious.Our alarm clock had been set by a previous guest and it went off at 4:00am with creepy music.Dining: Breakfast was great. Clean. Good coffee. Bagels. Yogurt. Fruit. Cereal. Really good croissants. The host was friendly.Pool and Bar area /Rest of Hotel: Looks like alot of fun, if you're in the young, stylish crowd! they also had a nice small gym. The halls are really dark and kind of creepy. There is furry, hairy wallpaper!Cost, Value: our room that slept 3 ended up being about $400/night with taxes. Since it's new york, i guess that's a good deal?

<Content>Knock-off is spot on In an area where you can buy knock-off designer purses at every corner, this W styled hotel is well situated. Although the hotel lacks some of the finer points offered by the W chain, it does offer a complimentary continental breakfast, reasonable parking rates (for self park) and an empty fridge to be stocked as you please. The only service that we missed was a decent concierge--most people came prepared with copies of the Lonely Planet NYC in tow. Still, a good concierge is invaluable in a city like New York. The bar in the hotel has a view into the 24/7 pool where 20 somethings reenact their high school pool party fantasies. Despite the well used bar service to the pool, few actually left the area during the couple of hours we were there. Bad news for the kiddies who go swimming in the tepid water the next day. The rooms are well designed for the limited space, clean and pretty cute. Excellent location for catching the subway but not so great for bars and night clubs which are filled to the brim with other annoying tourists. All in all, a good choice.

<Content>Small rooms but clean stylish and modern The QT is very well located just minutes away from Times Square. The main draw is the interior which is modern, minimalist and stylish. The trendy bar and pool are situated right beside eachother and there is a great steam room. The bar and pool were closed one evening though for a private party. The rooms are equipped with Ipod decks, flatscreen TV's and a great shower room. Space is at a premium however and the rooms do feel small. The other drawback about the room is that the toilet is separated from the bedroom by only a sliding door which doesn't lend much privacy. All in all this hotel is in a great location and is very stylish but quite small.

<Content>fine atmosphere, but room w hardly any daylight chose the hotel based on the little availability in town on the dates I stayed, and for the only available option at QT I paid 400$+ per night.Hotel was generally good but obviously no value for money.Very friendly and helpful personnel at check-in, large room on 3rd floor, with one very small window of say one yard by one yard. If you need to spend daytime inside your room = QT not to be recommended.Difficult also to get good cell phone contact from inside the room.Excellent bed, in typical design hotel layout, which was fine.Did not use the pool, but as a European, and given the location of the pool just at the bar and the mostly young guests, have no problem with topless swimming at all.And very convenient location close to Times Square. Excellent italian restaurant across the street.In summary, very good but too expensive

<Content>Ultra-modern scene The pool in the lobby is quite an unusual feature, particularly on evenings where there are pool parties. DJ spinning 70s brit-pop on the night I was there. Bikini-clad women (some drunk and removing their tops before being asked by staff to put them back on), steam rooms, saunas, showers. Never seen anything like it.Rooms are small but have a nice, modern Scandinavian design feel. Modern, upscale, well-designed bathrooms with good products and luxurious towels.For location, it's right in the middle of Times Square. Whether that's good or bad is for you to decide. Personally, I prefer other areas of the city.

<Content>cute and modern After a very long trip to get to New York City,my husband and I were looking forward to checking into our room.Upon arrival we were told that there was a problem at the hotel that day and our queen sized bed we had booked was not available that night and we would be staying in a room with four twin sized bunk beds.Not much of a romantic holiday!The next day we were upgraded to a king sized room which was great.The location of the hotel was excellent.There was some questionable activities going on in the pool at night(naked girl)so I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone over the age of 30.Breakfast as also very good.The hotel staff was not the greatest,they could use a few lessons in customer service,but overall it was a good hotel.

<Content>Cozy Paradise in Bustling NYC I've stayed in New York City several times, and this hotel is by far my favorite. The rooms are a little small, even for New York, but they were cozy all the same. We stayed in a Room C, with two bunk beds. The beds were extremely comfortable and equipped with Egyptian cotton. Each bed had its own personal TV that hooked up to a DVD/CD player mounted underneath the platform beds. However, when we got to our rooms we found that our room did not have a DVD/CD player. We called once down to the desk and the told us that it was indeed under the platform bed, which it wasn't. The second time we asked in person and they told us that our room never did have a DVD player, like promised.We stayed on the fourth floor and yet our room was very, very quiet and peaceful. The bathroom was a little less private than most because it had no door. It did have a sliding door between the shower and the toilet, enclosing the toilet in. It also, of course, had a shower curtain for the shower. The pool, sauna, and steam room were quite enjoyable. The pool was very warm- 92 degrees at one point- and very small. During the morning and afternoon there were few people there besides us. However, we went once at midnight to swim and found out that a private party was using it and that we couldn't swim until 1:30am. We were supposed to have recieved notice of this in our rooms, but we hadn't. The hotel was very cooperative with us when we informed them of this and we recieved $50 off of our room rate. Also, the continental breakfast was impressive. The service was also impressive as they gave us directions and held our bags for free the day we checked out. All in all, we had a very positive experience. If you are going to New York City, don't miss out on this rare gem. Stay at the Hotel QT!

<Content>The Fabulous Hotel QT This was my first trip to NYC and i had been planning it for about 4 months. My friend recommended this Hotel to me as a budget, basic, modern hotel, sounded perfect. I am a member of Mr and Mrs Smith and the hotel was on there so we booked it through them. When we arrived at aprox 2am we were greeted with a huge smile and and a warm welcome from the front of house staff. We where then given a free room upgrade and vouchers for our free drinks in the bar (the free drink was part of the deal through Mr and Mrs Smith but the upgrade was not). The room had a humongous king size bed and another small double bed suspended from the ceiling. sink in the living area near the closet and a big bathroom with huge shower. I have never slept in a more comfortable bed in my life, it made it very hard to get out of it each morning! There was no view to speak of but it really really didnt make a difference. the location of the hotel is just off Times Square and it takes no time at all to get anywhere in the city by Taxi. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone. The staff are really friendly, helpful and professional, the rooms are great and the location ideal for a first timer. Book it now!

<Content>Too "weird" if you consider yourself "normal" Our stay was an experience!UPs:- Location / Rates / Bed and pillows / TV, DVD and CD / free and good breakfast / free wireless internet conectionDOWNs- Embarassing bathroom / Tiny bedroom / StaffFirst it was something difficult to find out that the bookstand was the front desk. The staff had that kind of cool/superior look, like they'd preffer to be at a VIP party that we, guests were not invited. The room was VERY small, but we were able to hide our luggage under the bed, so we could walk around the bed. And bed was really comfortable, just as advertised. The room was very quiet too.The bathroom was not so small, with separate shower and toilet area. The only problem was a huge glass wall at this area with a complete view of a comercial building. Sometimes, when we were taking a shower we could look at people taking xerox copies at the next building. I am not sure if they could see us too...But it was VERY embarassing.The other guests were very young and very trendy. It was nice to watch them at breakfast.There were private parties, almost every night, at the pool and bar. When we arrived late at night we could watch the party guests enjoying themselves at the pool in many different ways. I was glad we didn't take the kids.It was not a completely bad experience because we had MANY stories to tell when we came back home.

<Content>Big mistake I arrived late on a Friday night. As soon as I stepped in the door, the odor of chlorine from the pool hit me, along with the blaring music. A lively party was going on in the pool, but no one seemed interested in helping arriving guests. I didn't see that the magazine kiosk/candy counter was also the front desk. I had to shout to make myself heard. In the room, the platform bed was comfortable, but it was at window height, with no space in between, so cold air blew across the bed. I finally had to stuff an extra blanket below the curtain. The lighting was so dim that it was hard to see things on the floor. The remote control for the TV didn't work. Breakfast was serve-yourself coffee, bagels, and cold cereal, and there are only a few places to sit, so you may have to wait a long time. The rooms come with no amenities, which in these days of no carry-on liquids or gels, is shocking considering the room rates. What I'd hoped would be a fun weekend turned out to be quite unpleasant. I wouldn't stay there again under any circumstances.

<Content>A Cut Above. The QT is probably one of the better small hotels for this part-time. Sure the rooms are small but the rates, breakfast included, location and the overall quality makes this a worthwhile place to stay. They were even repainting the main columns in the lobby when I was there. Unlike so many hotels this place shows an attention to details. The free breakfast, by US standards, was excellent.

<Content>Trendy Midtown Hotel If you want super trendy and cool then the QT is for you. The kiosk style reception and the swim up pool in the lobby were nice touches. The location if you want to be in Midtown is great, a minutes walk and you are in Times Square. The staff weren't over friendly but that wasn't a big deal. One warning! If you are choosing the cheapest of rooms then it will be very very small, ours was just about big enough to fit a double in, there was a lack of storage for cases but it was all well furnished and clean. The breaksfast was alright too, basic but enough to start your day!!

<Content>Fun and Different Wasn't sure what to expect but was very pleasantly surprised. All front desk staff except one or two people were super helpful and friendly. King bed was super comfortable. More counter space in the bathroom would have been nice but no biggie. Pool and lounge were super chique. Breakfast was just right. Front desk is a retro 50's style candy counter. Location is awesome near Time Square but a few steps out of the hub bub and centrally located in Midtown. Room was plenty spacious for two. Nothing was lacking. Would stay again if I could get another good deal. Was lucky enough to get an avg/night price of $179 CAN for five nights + taxes and fees. Friends from New York visited us at the hotel and they plan on recommending it to their visitors to the city. But ask for an upgrade to a King when you check in.

<Content>I recommend this hotel! I recently stayed in this hotel as a surprise trip for my boyfriends' 30th birthday - i had contacted the hotel in advance to tell them this  to ask for advice on places to go so was nicely surprised to find when we arrived that we had been upgraded which definitely made our jet lag feel better ( my wallet as i had already got a great deal on this place on the mr  mrs smith website!). The hotel was great, very modern and the staff were incredibly friendly  helpful. The location is great for tourists and for those who just want to enjoy the nightlife which is the category we fell into. The hotel bar is a great place to start or finish your night - the measures are very strong....take your swimming costume down if you're feeling brave!Overall i would recommend this hotel if you want a modern  funky place to stay, good location, don't mind having a medium sized room  want a great nights' sleep on the best bed i've ever laid on.

<Content>Good Value, Comfy Beds, Crazy Neighborhood This is the second time I've stayed at the Hotel QT. The rooms are quiet, calm, and clean. The free breakfast and free Wi-Fi make this a good value. I was in a room on the third floor, so I could hear the thumpa-thumpa-thumpa of the speakers from the bar downstairs at night. It didn't bother me, but I know that it would drive my husband bananas if he had been traveling with me. My big problem is that Times Square is getting so out-of-control crowded that I'm not sure I want to stay there anymore. I come to NYC primarily for business, and it gets tiring, pushing through the millions of people who have never seen a Toys-R-Us before just to get to the subway downtown. I'll probably be back, but not during high tourist season.

<Content>QT Multiple Stays My business has taken me to NYC twice in the past month and Hotel QT is on their preferred vendor list. I was so pleased with my stay the first time around I begged to have them book it the second time for my week stay. The location is stellar. Pubs for a night cap right next door, Duane Reade for essentials right up the block...and most importantly Times Square a stone's throw from the front door. The staff was freindly and helpful, the complimentary breakfast...while light...is still a good value and beats the egg wedge and crusty potato cake you get at most free breakfasts. The pool was the discussion of my trip the whole time. My business associates who stayed at other hotels did not believe I had a swim-up bar at the hotel and it took a google search to prove it. The best part of the pool area for me is that they had underwater speakers and they CARED about the music. Most places hit the radio and forget about it. You can tell that the music is suited for the arc of the day. Very quiet and calming early morning and gradually increasing in energy until nighttime when it is bumpin. Certainly not a place for the modest! All of the lobby and bar area can see you in pool (what polar bears must feel like at zoo) and my shower on the 11th floor had a HUGE bay window looking out to offices across...half was frosted...but anyone with binoculars and some time could get quite a show looking at that hotel. The bed was TOO comfortable...it was quite hard to get out of it each morning! Once I did however, had a swim, had a steam, had free breakfast, enjoyed my rain shower, got dressed and hit the city...I felt rested, relaxed, and rejuvinated...all signs of a good hotel. Love the QT....charming...inventive...quirky...fun!!! Try something new...you will love it.

<Content>Excellent stay at the QT Myself and my partner have just returned from a 6 night stay at the hotel Qt. Having read some of the reviews on the website we were slightly concerned about the size of room we were to have and the activities within the pool area!However this Hotel is excellent. We had room F (smallest style) and found it to be perfect for us - large, comfy double bed, LCD TV with DVD player, Ipod alarm clock, huge modern bathroom with rain effect walk-in shower (with Neutrogena products). Closet space is a little limited but there is plenty of space on the platform surrounding the bed. We were on the 11th floor at the back of the building and it was extremely quiet. They were actually fitting new windows in all rooms during our stay so all rooms should be very sound-proof!The location is very convenient for Times Square, Fifth Avenue, and Macy's. Choice of 2 subway stops in Times Square - one to the right and to the left. There are 3 good Irish bars within a couple of doors of the hotel and of course you have the bright lights of times square down the street - Virgil鈥檚 BBQ is a good place to head if you are hungry - think hand towels instead of napkins!The hotel lobby is cool with very helpful and friendly staff. The pool area is lovely ... especially after a hard day shopping. It is very quiet during the day and early evening, it did get busier after 8pm but was not too loud and we were not offended or uncomfortable - Don't be put off by some reviews stating wild parties throughout the night, we certainly did not see any.The hotel breakfast is served from 7-11am (mid-day on weekends) and is very enjoyable - especially the croissants and lattes (there is a free coffee machine available all day and night)There were a variety of people staying at the hotel - couples of all ages, families, small groups of friends and business people.Overall - excellent hotel, excellent staff and excellent location.

<Content>Sleek and Comfortable -Fabulous location. However, if you really want to see the real New York, get away from Times Square and visit TriBeca, Williamsburg, Soho, Greenwich or the East Village!-Rooms were small, minimalist and trendy. Made very good use of converted office building. Like everyone else, I agree that the bed was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. I usuallyhave a hard time sleeping in hotels but I was asleep within minutes.-Sauna, steam room, pool and bar area were amazing and very sleek. I only stayed here one night but used the facilities twice because it was so refreshing and relaxing. (Beware the creepy men if you're a girl though).-The hotel website offered an inflated rate of $270 in Feb for the cheapest room but if you shop around a bit online you can get a much better rate.-Staff were helpful and friendly. -The free breakfast was very adequate (cereals, hard-boiled eggs, muffins, bagels, OJ, oatmeal etc...) I enjoy how late they have the serving hours especially after a very late night of partying. Overall it was a very young, fun and hip hotel that I would stay at again. The rooms are adequate and nothing special, but the facilities are great.

<Content>Good, Unique, Low-Frills Option I stayed at the QT over a cold weekend in February and it was a great choice. I booked the cheapest available rate, $199/night, through the hotel website, and when checking in was given a complimentary upgrade. The room, on a high floor, had a bit of a view of the lights of Times Square. It was small but perfectly arranged, with a small table, a very small TV, and a large king size platform bed with one of the most comfortable mattresses I've ever had the pleasure of sleeping on. The bathroom was minimal with a rain-style showerhead, overall lighting could have been better, and in the extremely dry NY winter a small bottle of body lotion would have been appreciated. The pool/bar area was a bit overwhelming on check-in. It's right there by the elevators and was full of good-looking, cavorting youths when I stumbled through after my long flight. But the next afternoon, after a freezing walk around the city, I came back and sat in the steam room, took a swim in the little pool (actually more like the size of 4 hot tubs) which was all deserted, and felt like a new man. Who these people are jumping in the pool at 2am, though, I have no idea. The lobby bar is cute and a great place to arrange to meet friends. Just a half-block from Times Square, the location is almost too central, and the area is very touristy, thus it's a bit tough to find a cheap breakfast or whatever. But, that's New York. The subway isn't exactly right downstairs, but Times Square entrances are just a couple blocks away. It was a good compromise between downtown clubs, midtown art, and uptown friends. For 200/night, it's a great, hip place with a fun, unique style, and if you dont' care about people watching you, a jump in the pool can hit the spot.

<Content>Hotel QT Hotel QT is a centrally located Manhattan hotel that is pretty contemporary in set up. The rooms are a good size. We had a queen size bed on the bottom and a bunk size twin on the top of the queen. The bottom bed was great but my friend said her top one was rather stiff. The pillows were perfect and the flat screen TV was cool on the wall. There was room to sit and read at a table. The only complaint I had was the bathroom. The toilet area was next to the walk in shower area and there was a sliding door that you could either slide for the shower or the potty part. So unless you wanted to hang all out you had to make sure the showers/potties were being used at different times. Also there was not a door dividing the whole bathroom from the living area. I guess it wouldn't matter with most folks to step out of the shower and be standing in the area you would like to have privacy to do your out of the shower things, if you were together there as a couple. But this was just my friend, who happened to be very shy and had to hid in the closet to get dressed due to no door on the bathroom. Other than that and the fact that the pool was closed to hotel guest the whole 5 days we were there so they could have DVD parties at night and new magazine parties in the pool area. I would have enjoyed a dip during our 100 degree weather during the day. I also would have liked to have a coffee pot in the room instead if having to go upstairs for it each morning ......that was not convienent

<Content>Funky Kewl The location is great, just off Time Square. The bed is very comfortable. Good value for money - free local call, free breakfast. Except my wireless connection doesnt work in my room, a hassle to keep going down to the bar area to get online...the shower water pressure could be more powerful. On the whole, I love this hotel and will certainly come back again.

<Content>Swim up bar! We stayed at the QT based on the reviews of this very site. I was somewhat apprehensive as it was touted as a unique experience, but upon arrival I liked it. It's simple, the rooms are small and oddly designed. The staff was more like a convenience store staff than the typical hotel staff that will do anything to make you happy, yet I didn't have a major problem with it.The swim up bar is awesome, but also leads to the negative aspect of this review. After a night of drinking way too much, we went to our room where it all came back up. In the morning we cleaned up the mess the best we could and even left housekeeping a $20 tip with a request to mop or do something to get the smell out of the room. When we came back later that day NOTHING had been done about the smell and yet the tip was gone. The floor hadn't been cleaned at all, let alone mopped. I was shocked at the dishonesty. Then, before dinner I called the front desk and appraised them of my disdain and they promised to take care of it. I came back from dinner and still nothing.On the up side, it has the most comfortable bed I've probably ever slept in.Conclusion:For a hotel in this price range, you would expect far better housekeeping service. That aside, it was a fun place to stay right off of Times Square in the middle of Manhatten and who can beat a swim up bar.

<Content>Don't come if you're used to chain hotels I know this is a boutique hotel, but there are some things that you expect from a hotel. A lot of things are missing so brace yourself if you stay here.As a qualifier, I travel pretty frequently for business, but this trip is for leisure.THE GOOD: The hotel definitely has that cool trendy vibe and the bar / pool area is truly excellent. Also the rooms have a ipod speakers. Wireless internet is free.THE BAD:1. Room not well designed: About 3 feet above our King size bed was a twin size bunk bed that made sleeping very uncomfortable. There was also no desk or place to put your wallet, purse, etc. except on the bathroom counter.2. Rooms are way too dark: There is just one dimly lit light in the bathroom which makes it hard for girls to put on makeup.3. Missing some basic amenities: Lotion is not standard in the room.4. Poor operations / service: Wake up call didn't come as requested at 9:30am. I got a call at 10:10am asking if I got a wake up call but that wouldn't have helped if I had an important meeting. Also, housekeeping didn't reset the radio alarm so we had a nice wake-up at 4am (who wakes up at 4am in a hotel like this!)

<Content>Great place, location, service, price, etc. Stayed at the QT 5 nights in early December '06. This hotel should be ranked as a 5 star de luxe. It's location is just perfect right off Times Sq. The room was on the 15th floor (the hotel has 16 floors). It was clean, silent, ideal size and well distributed. The shower was fantastic. Bed was a little soft for my poor old back, but my partner found it perfect to get a good sleep. The service and staff was very good (the guy that runs breakfast requires a special mention and thanks for taking such good care of us and every morning). Breakfast, pretty complete and very good quality, is included in the room rates! I'd definitely recommend the QT and obsviously will return if I travel to NYC.

<Content>Great boutique in central Manhattan This hotel is perfect if you want a trendy, clean boutique hotel with no frilly nonsense, in a great location for the tourists sights of new york. The positives:The rooms are defiantly minimalist, but its a style i like, although i can see how some may find the room's plain. The size was great and we stayed for 6 days - the lack of room dressing helps maximise the space. And they were spotlessly clean. The bed was the comfiest thing I have ever slept on - so much so i'm looking into buying a mattress for my home. The sheets were crisp egyptian cotton adding to the comfort. The radio with ipod dock was a great touch for playing some music while getting ready to hit the town of an evening. And the dvd and flat screen great for chilling the morning after. Location is fab and very central - times square is under a mintue away.  Transport is great, with subway less than 5 mins away, but beware getting a cab to get downtown on a friday or saturday night can be tricky - we actually ended up jumping on the subway. The breakfast was simple but very nice and who cares if their cutlery is plastic? Its what goes in your mouth that counts and the fresh bagels and muffins rocked. Plus the coffee was great!The bar always had a lively atmosphere, the drinks were spot on and the party kept going late into the night without disturbing our stay. The front desk provided some good tips on trendy bars/restaurants and gave us some complimentary passes to certain clubs. The pool and sauna looked cool although we never found time to use them! The negatives:The front desk seemed to have an issue with taking a holding deposit on a UK chip and pin debit or credit card - between me and my partner we tried several cards unsuccessfully. In the end they kept locking us out of our room each day, which was a little rude when we kept trying to pay them! To be fair this is an issue we found in restaurants and shops across NY - so no real fault of QT - and if my business was owed over a 1000 $'s (we stayed for 6 nights) i'd get a bit twitchy! The shower in our room could have done with a little more water pressure!The gym is tiny to say the least, but hey there is enough equipment to work up a sweat. The location although great from the tourism side is a bit far from the happening night life of NYC - we struggled to find any cool bars or restaurants nearby.But overall this was a great hotel i'd have no problem with recommending to friends and returning to myself.

<Content>It depends what you're looking for It depends what you're looking for. If it's a large, standard room, hotel chain business style, plush carpets, chintz, renaissance or victorian ornaments... stay somewhere else. If on the other hand you want a well priced room, bare modern style, in a central NYC location, you may love the QT. My room was small and the decor so minimalist that it first felt like a cell. After a while, I got used to it though and started to enjoy all the amenities, some gimmicky but most are smart and well-thought in my opinion. Nice comfy bed, flat screen TV, radio with iPod station, free High-Speed Internet, large shower (no tub)... If you are not planning to spend the entire day in your room, everything is there and it's quite clean. The lobby is very small, the pool-bar area a little weird in my opinion, but the free breakfast is a nice plus in NYC and the croissants were really good. If you can get a room for less than $250, this is an excellent choice that it is likely to beat all basic budget NYC hotels easily. If the rates are above $250, think twice, there might be better options, more elegant and with more space.

<Content>Oh dear After researching hotels at which to stay in New York, I found that the British press seemed to have latched on to this place and given it some impressive reviews. I don't generally believe in conspiracy theories, but this place has got me thinking.Firstly, the good bits. The location is excellent. That's it. Having read all the previous reviews I don't know whether I'm missing something, but I just don't get this. I would liken the experience to staying in a stupifyingly overpriced youth hostel. View any of the promotional material, website, magazine articles, and you will see an idyllic shot of a swimming pool with a cocktail bar, effecively in it. This is the hotel's only good feature, and resultantly the whole place smells of swimming pools, whether you're in the reception, the lift, your room. We did try this pool out as I quite liked the idea of having a cocktail during swimming. Only problem was that there was never anyone serving. Talking of the reception, this is basically a sweet shop with someone serving, and miserably at that. On arrival, we were grunted at by a bloke who I assumed was in charge, but I got the distinct feeling I was interrupting his daydream. We were early, but the prospect of early check-in seemed to him preposterous, and our luggage was therefore stored by his colleague.The room to be fair was ok, but no better than ok. Again, it had a gimic feature, this time an elevated bed, but the room itself was poorly lit, depressingly decorated in grey, and had that open prison feel about it, which for an opening night tariff of $360 you don't really expect.Travel Inn experience for Marriott prices. The lesson is, I think, don't fall for the magazine reviews.

<Content>Great Value A great value for a place to sleep and shower. Modern and efficient design readapting an old office building along the lines of a European hostel (although in this case a luxury European hostel). Breakfast was nothing special, but the fact that one was offered in a New York budget hotel is exceptional.

<Content>Amazing hotel This Hotel us the best! Having visited New York a few times before, this was by far the best experience that I had as Hotel Qt is amazing!As if the location wasn't good enough (its on west 45th street between 6th and broadway) From the moment I stepped into the lobby I was imoressed. All the reviews that I had read prior to booking had stated that the hotel didn't have a proper lobby so I had no idea what to expect. I was however pleasantly surprised...the lobby is really nice and the vibrant atmosphere immediately made me feel at ease! The next pleasant surprise was the room. I had read reviews that the rooms werent very spacious - that is typical of many New York Hotels though so this room was no different...apart from the fact that my normal hotels are minimalist and simplistic. The room in hotel Qt however was spectacular. Both the room and adjoining bathroom were immaculate, and there was not a hint of dirt to be seen! As if I wasn't already impressed by my room I simply had to step out in2 the corridor to be greeted by a beautiful spa/sauna! This is a hotel I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a great stay in New York city!

<Content>Contemporary style in a budget Over recent years, New York hotels have gradually returned to their former price levels, making the task of finding a decent hotel ever harder. The QT hotel provides a great boutique style hotel for those who would like contemporary style hotel accomodation on a budget, without all the frills one would associate with the major hotels, such as the 'W'. At $275 per night for a single room in November, we are not talking cheap, but considering this hotel is situated in the heart of Manhattan in the Times Square area, this was acutally quite good value. The room I had was small, but the fixtures were all new and clean, plus the bed and bedding were extremely comfortable. It so frustrating to pay say 拢250 ($450) per night at a supposedly luxury hotel and find you have a cheap bed wth synthetic pillows. The owners of the QT have economised in a lot of areas by providing self-service breakfast (incuded) where you have plastic plates and cutlery. But when it comes to important things like a good bed to sleep on, they provide you with the best in comfort. I also like the fact that you get free broadband wireless included. All, in all very good value for this area of New York.

<Content>Too old for gimmicks We are 60ish and went to the QT after a recommendation in Diversion, a magazine for physicians. To say we were disappointed would be an understatement. We had a queen size bed on a platform, up against the wall. In order to get out of the bed you have crawl to the end and walk on a faux ostrich platform and then jump down onto the floor. What could they be thinking to not have towel bars or hooks. You could hang a towel on the room door hinge or over the toilet, but that is ridiculous. We couldn't have made it one more night. They do a nice job with the breakfast, however.

<Content>Best NYC location for the price This was our second, 4-day stay @ the QT!We arrived very early, and were able to check our bags, scope out the city, and returned in the afternoon to an upgraded room...still small, but the large bathroom made it seem bigger.the bed is extremely comfy, even though the flat screen tv seemed very close ( b/c it WAS!)i awoke about 6 AM to the baking aroma of the fresh muffins served at breakfast ..yummy..and they were! Clifton, the breakfast guy, couldn't be nicer...the coffee is a Starbucks equal!we didn't use the pool this year ( didn't have time!), but, i loved it just being there!the location was PERFECT for us, since we saw 4 broadway shows, and were able to return to the room and change for clubbing w/ little effort. All the subways were less than a 5 minute walk.I can't WAIT to return to the QT in '07!!!

<Content>Great choice We stayed 2 nights at this hotel. Our room was extremely small, this was not a surprise having read the reviews on this site. We had all that we needed for a hotel room in New York, A very comfortable bed and a clean room with a wonderful shower. If I had been staying longer the size of room may have been a problem, our friends had booked the same category and their room was bigger with more closet space. It may be worth asking for a room to the rear of the hotel as we were at the front and the room was very noisy through the night - it is New York after all!!Breakfast was a very chilled out experience with chill out music playing .A self service area with juice, bagels ,croissants, muffins and boiled eggs. Also there is cereal , fruit and yoghurt. All that we needed. We didn't get to use the pool area , it looked like great fun and was very clean.I would stay in this hotel again if I got a good rate, we paid $200 with travel intelligence, a great price I thought.Hope this has been helpful , if you go - enjoy your stay.

<Author>NYC30SomethingGirl
<Content>Best Deal For Budget Swank in NYC I am a New Yorker for seven years now (30-something female; musican, non-drinker). I'm constantly asked for hotel recommendations in the city - something clean, affordable, and ideally, stylish. QT is all three. That sounded like an ad but it's totally true. NOWHERE will you get an experience like this for under 200 bucks in NYC. Rooms are small like most NYC hotels. They are immaculately clean, modern. Excellent bathroom with a unique glass-paned shower wall (no tub) and stone floors. Hotel lobby is set up like a theatre concession stand, and adjacent to that, there's a small shallow pool for hanging out; one can wade over to a window in the bar and order a drink. I used it when no-one else was in it. Relaxing in conjunction with the steam room. Flat-panel TVs. Good magazines. Location is near Times Square which for many people is actually no-mans-land, but it's a quick cab to downtown restaurants or uptown museums. It's not a 'sunny' place, it's more of a velvety dark swanky clean sort of vibe. Modern. Go for it. Trust me.

<Content>Highly recommended! My husband and I spend Labor Day weekend in NYC. We found Hotel QT through tripadvisor and also various recent publications. Hotel QT was modern, fresh, the free breakfasts were AWESOME and the service was great too! Can't beat the location. We orig booked an E room for $220/night, but got ugraded to a B room. Although the room was still small, the furnishings maximized the space. The platform around the bed created seating space, and the deep window ledges allowed for some storage space. I loved the two huge windows in the room looking toward times square (we had a corner room). I was really impressed with the iHome unit they had, so we could play our iPod in the room. The shower was amazingly large, and I liked the separate shower/sink/toilet areas. I agree with the previous posts - a place to hang wet towels would've been nice, but we made do with what we had.My appreciation for Hotel QT grew even more when we moved to the Comfort Inn Midtown for our last night (we used a free nights' stay at Comfort Inn). Comfort Inn is noticeably older. The room was about the same size as Hotel QT's E room, but felt smaller b/c of the traditional furniture. The bathroom was TINY compared to Hotel QT. Perhaps, though, this isn't a fair comparison since Hotel QT's B room is considerably more expensive than Comfort Inn's.For our next trip to NYC, we will definitely look into staying at Hotel QT again. If you can afford it (ie, get hold of the lower rate rooms), go for it! Otherwise, Comfort Inn Midtown isn't *too* bad of a second choice.

<Content>We put Sweden on the map in best hotel in New York. We decide to visit New York and saw an article about Hotel QT in a swedish magazine. It sounds like a good choise. We made reservation on the hotels website. It did work very well. We printed out the reservation and took it with us in cause of any trouble. We alsow did a calculation on the tax, so we knew how much the final bill would end up. No surprices could destroy our trip. We came to the hotel friday afternoon and the check in was very easy, they were very friendly. We stayed there for six nights. We have heard that the rooms was small. We have been traveling in europe a lot and to us it was not a problem. We have been staying in smaller room than his. If your in New York, how much time are you gonna spend in the room? I think most of us are there for another reason than stay in a room.Our room was very nice, we hade choosen alternitve E. It had all we could ever ask for. Our small window was in the direction of roofs and another building. Breakfast was better then we expected. It was served bagels, yoghurt , jam, fruits, egg, juice, milk, coffee or tea.Our cleaning lady was very friendly. If she saw us on our way out in the mornings she asked if she could clean and always wished us a nice day.The bar downstairs was very crowed sometimes and loud but we on the eight floor didn't hear a thing. Downstair the also had an ATM machine and two computors with internet access.The location was the best. A few steps from Times Square. In the centre of all but at the same time not. When we came from the airport Newark. We ended up at the station at Port Authority with the airport bus. From their we had to walk five blocks to the hotel. It's not a problem not even when we on our way home had to walk to the bus with a lot more stuff we had bought.Summary. I can highly recomend this hotel to anyone on their way to New York. It is clean and freash.

<Content>Loved it! I spent ages looking for somewhere suitable for my first visit to New York - I listened to my friends horror stories, read the guide books and finally stumbled across the Hotel QT - it made my stay!The location is perfect, within walking distance of everything! And yet it didn't seem noisy at all. I had a small room - the lowest priced room - at the back of the hotel on the 11th Floor. Yes, the room was small but it had everything I needed - big comfy bed, flat screen TV, and a gorgeous bathroom! The shower was a treat! A DVD player was a nice bonus too!The breakfast was great, plenty of choice. The kiosk where you can buy snacks and stuff from was okay, although they didn't sell ice cream which was a little disappointing.The staff were really helpful and friendly - next time I'm in New York I'll be staying there!

<Content>Loved Hotel QT I am a bit late writing this review, but I loved this hotel so much that I thought it was better late than never! So, I stayed at Hotel QT for just over two weeks in June '06 with my boyfriend... There were a few things that didn't go as smoothly as hoped, such as the hotel not having our reservation when we arrived (this problem was quickly sorted by the lovely receptionist who upgraded our room and gave us some nicely chilled beers to take up with us!), and also the fact that there were so many chemicals in the pool (which, I have to admit, seemed to be closed almost every three or four days... only for an hour or two though!) that my boyfriends trunks changed from navy blue to a strange greeny colour! So, if you're going swimming wear old trunks/bikinis, and take off any jewellery too!However, despite these slight hitches we had an amazing stay! The pool/bar area is just too cool for words... there are pool parties every tuesday and thursday... and as for the weekend... all I'll say is simply, don't even think about staying here if you aren't up for a good party! (Oh, and if you are in the bar look out for Jeremy, he's the absolutely gorgeous one with the long-ish dark hair... tell him that his favourite Scottish customers are asking for him!) Lol! I really can't express in words just how cool the pool/bar is... whatever you do, don't forget your swimming gear... and it would be a crime to visit this hotel and not have a cosmo while lazing in the pool!The rooms are great... I've never stayed in a hotel in NY before, but I wouldn't say they are overly small... enough room in the handy storage space under the bed for our two large suitcases, and plenty of rail space for the clothes we wanted to hang up! The shower/toilet set-up may be a bit open plan for people that aren't that close... but for us it was fine! As people have said before the bed is amazingly comfy... and the actual lay-out of the room is very well planned with regards to space available!As it has been said in almost every review, the hotel's location is excellent... literally a 2 minute walk from Times Square (yet surprisingly quiet at the actual hotel despite this), and right next to a great Irish pub (there seemed to be lots of them close to the hotel!) called O'Lunneys (ask for Keith! and if you're looking for a 1am snack after a good night out drinking have a cheeseburger - they certainly do the trick!).... there is also a Starbucks close to the hotel which was handy for popping out for sandwiches in the morning (the hotels breakfast is great... just that we were never up in time to catch it!)! Overall (as you may have guessed!) we loved this hotel... it was built for the phrase TOO COOL FOR WORDS!!!!!!!

<Content>Overpriced We booked the QT through Tablet Hotels which we have used several times in the past  found some really amazing places with. After reading all of the reviews on here  looking at the pictures we felt convinced that we had made the right choice, splitting our trip into 2 half at Hotel QT, half at the Hudson.We chose QT specifically as my boyfriend likes to have a swimming pool whilst on holiday  there are obviously not that many choices in the middle of NYC.As you walk into the reception you think - hey this is pretty cool, then they tell us the pool is out of order - not a good start! We made our way up to our room  to be honest our corridor was pretty shabby with big scrapes  dents in the wall. Our room was average - the window was broken  jammed open  really it could have just done with a lick of paint. Excellent bathroom though  I like the fact you can buy food  drink from reception so you can make up your own minibar.Breakfast is very good - so many bagels - I love bagels  proper coffee.Location is excellent if you just wanna trapse around times square  broadway  as this is the first time we have been to NYC  we found the village was our favourite part it was a bit dissapointing as we were a long way away.Having said all of that it was very very expensive, felt more like we were staying in a youth hostel than a hotel - we booked ages in advance  it still cost us $220 a night which was more than the Hudson which was in a completely different league - so so so superior to the QT. I have also stayed in the Standard in LA which is designed by the same guy  my advice would be; if you have stayed in the Standard do not stay at QT as you will be dissapointed!I can't help thinking that when it opened it was probably really quite cool, but it needs to be better maintained as it just felt shabby. What a shame!!!

<Content>Returning... I stayed here August 2005 and loved it so this time, returning to NYC with a friend, I booked us at the QT June 8th to 14th. Our trip started out quite badly with the radar at the Stockholm Airport failing with several hours of delays to all flights. In the end, we were flown to Iceland only to find that our connecting flight had left. The Hotel has a 24 hour policy, i.e. all changes to the reservation has to be made 24 hours in advance so I figured I would be paying for a night I didn't use. I called the hotel, explained that we were stranded in Iceland and would be arriving 24 hours later and would it be at all possible to change the arrival date?. The very nice and attentive lady I spoke to (after she had returned my call to me in Iceland since I failed to reach her five minutes previously) observed that things like these happen and told me our reservation was changed as of that moment. This was approx three hours before our estimated late evening check-in time... We arrived to find that the improvements they were making to the hotel design and structure last year were indeed improvements. Everything was as good as last time or possibly better (barbells in the gym for example). This time around I ended up in a room on the eight floor with my friend three doors down the hall. Both our rooms were a bit smaller than the one I had the last time (on the 15th floor) and more elongated. The bathroom/bed solutions worked fine this way too though and while I prefered the more square room I had last time, this worked out excellent. The staff was very attentive and forthcoming. This included the front desk, the cleaning staff, security, breakfast lounge and bar, all of which we had reason to interact with and all of which displayed a high degree of flexibility and service-mindedness. Besides the interior design that I really enjoy and the setup regarding room-layout, breakfast lounge and the pool-area/bar, not to mention the location, the staff really makes this hotel worthwhile. This is my hotel in NYC. I will be returning yet again.

<Content>Positive Experience, Great Location I stayed here with my sister on August 2nd for one night. Front desk was always friendly and let us check in at 10:00 a.m. on the day of arrival which was very helpful. It was outrageously hot during our visit. Room air conditioning worked great. Street noise was minimal -- we were on the 6th floor facing the street (room 612). Room was adequately sized and very clean. Our bathroom did not have the open configuration as described in other reviews; it had a pocket door and a towel rack. The bathroom seemed to be a little dark at first, but there was a dimmer on the light switch that we did not see and that solved the problem. Bed was very comfortable and sheets were very nice (from Italy). Everything worked great (iron, TV, hair dryer) and I liked the decor. My only very minor complaint is that the bed is pushed up against the wall. I like to sleep with one of my feet hanging over the bed and I couldn't (weird, I know). Also, there is no footboard to the bed so it's easy to exit even if you're against the wall. Location is convenient to Times Square. One block from many theaters, one block from the TKTS booth, and a few block from Radio City where we were going to see Harry, Carrie  Garp. This would not be my first choice of a location for exploring New York but . . . like I said, it was so HOT that wandering around New York wasn't much of an option.

<Content>Finally a great place to stay in New York We booked this hotel through expedia and what a fabulous place. It was close to the theatre district and was very funky. The pool design was amazing. Breakfast was decent with friendly staff (a rarity in New York breakfast joints). The room had the most comfortable bed and LCD tv. I was most excited about the comfy window seat where I read some very hip magazines they left us. The overall room was small but fine for a couple. The bathroom setup was a little strange with a toilet/ shower combo but no worries the water doesn't reach there. Having stayed at some real dives (like the Choice hotels) this was definitely a treat. We were there for the Thanksgiving Day parade and was impressed to still find a great room of this caliber still available.

<Content>Form over Function I recently stayed at the Hotel QT in NYC. It is very fashionable, hip and trendy but they didn't get the basics right. I showed up and they could not find my reservation. They were accomodating and got me a room but it was on the third floor and dark as a dungeon and about the size of a closet at the 4 Seasons. Very fashionably decorated though. I got traded up to a room on the 10th floor that was brighter. Why didn't they give me that room in the first place? Once again, a stylish room but not functional. First of all, there were no towels in the bathroom. Dripping wet from my shower, i finally found them in the closet. I brushed my teeth and lo and behold there were no water glasses to rinse with. The shower was so narrow and the tap was located diredtly at the back so you got soaked with cold water when turing it on. Finally the showcase pool on the main floor was closed for repairs and the TV was terrible. It was a nice, but small, flat screen, but you had the press the channel button about 3 times and then wait about 3 seconds for the channel to change. Very frustrating for channel surfers!! Price was good I guess and they gave out free breakfast.

<Content>First time to NYC, loved Hotel QT We stayed in Hotel QT at the beginning of July on our first trip to NYC. As others have stated, Hotel QT is in a great location. 1 minute from Times Square, a few blocks from Rockefeller Center, and subway entrances. The hotel itself was very modern and well appointed. Our bed was very comfortable and while the room was small, we did not feel that we lacked any space. Storage was available under the raised bed which also helped. The hotel also provided free continental breakfast which was great to take advantage of. If you're looking for a more hearty breakfast, Cafe Europa is around the corner from the hotel and they have good breakfast items at cheap prices. The only complaint of the whole trip was that the pool was closed for maintenance. This didn't stop us from enjoying the rest of the hotel and our stay. We would definately stay here again.

<Content>Good location - minor quibbles I would definitely stay there again:- great location- nice decor- pricey but not bad by NYC standards- rooms are spartan but clean, great linens.2 minor quibbles:- Invest in some towel racks in the bathrooms. There's no place to hang wet bath towels.- Soft beds are comfy but lead to back pain after a couple of nights.

<Content>Simply the Best Cant' really fault this hotel. Just a bit funky in one room where the lavatory doesn't have a door on it. Make sure you're WELL acquainted (i.e. on pooing terms) with anyone you intend to share the room with.Location fantastic. Two minutes (literally) from Times Square. Avoid Tarzan the Musical though, unless you want to be played NINE new and completely forgettable songs penned by Phil Collins (The Lion King it ain't.)I simply refuse to stay anywhere else in New York. (OK, I've only been the once, but you get what I'm getting at.)

<Content>Very trendy hotel in a perfect location!!! Very nice hotel with a friendly staff. We had to move our room two times (first time our room was very small and the second time we had a room to the street - changed it after one night without much sleep). The third room was perfect.For New Yorker standards really big rooms and we did not hear anything from the sreetnoise. Very nice shower!!! The location for sightseeing is absolutely perfect. You are on times square in 2 minutes.Would definitly stay here again. The price is very good for this location and a very good hotel.

<Content>Hotel QT is Great! My wife and I booked our Hotel QT stay online from Sydney, months before, sight unseen. All we had to go was the reviews on Tripadvisor and the Hotel QT website. We were VERY impressed. 1 - it's VERY cool. All the rooms are different, but very trendy and yes, the beds are the most comfortable hotel bed ever. The shower/bathroom/toilet all in the same room didn't bother us, but it might if you're not intimate with the person you're sharing with. We stayed in 2 rooms over 6 nights as we had to change after the first night - we were on the 8th floor right over the street and the noise from the Garbage trucks drove me mad (my wife says she didnt' hear them but they drilled into my head). The great news was that when I went downstairs to tell reception at 3am, they were really nice about it and moved us to a (larger) room at the back of the building the very next morning. This new room, on the 10th floor, was so quiet we overslept everyday!!! The room was cleaned everyday, regardless of what time we left the hotel, and the staff were always friendly.BTW - we booked the Class B room, so I don't know what the cheaper ones are like.2 - it's 15 seconds to Times Square.There are also some great bars next door, and a deli 3 doors up. You have to buy your own mini bar supplies which you can do from reception. This is great if you feel like a beer at 3am, but it's very expensive. Go 3 doors up and grab a 6 pack for the same price as 2 beers at reception. 3 - Breakfast is great and you can eat enough to keep you going. Cereal, Bagels, Fruit, Juice, Coffee, Croissants, Yoghurt etc. You can eat it there, or the guy serving was kind enough to give us a tray to take it back to our room. There's heaps of seating too, just don't get there too late or there's no good pastries left! Remember to tip the nice man!!4 - The pool and bar look great, but with so much to do and see in Manhattan, we never got the chance to use it. Although on one night we were there I thought we had walked into a nightclub when we came back to the Hotel. All in all, we would reccomend this Hotel to anyone young, young at heart, or anyone that wants a grrovy stay in NYC.Basically, next time we're in NYC, we'll be staying back at the Hotel QT.

<Content>Not amazing, but ok So, when my boyfriend and I arrived at the Hotel Qt on Monday night we were suprised to find that there was a private party going on in the bar area and it was very crowded with some colorful characters. I was hoping to maybe get to use the steam room or sauna before bed but the whole pool area was like a scene out of a Roman bathhouse. Guys making out, girls swinging drinks around. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for having a good time but I was not expecting this type of scene at all when we arrived. It was very noisy but once we got to the room you couldn't hear anything. But when we did make it to the room we were a little dissapointed to say the least. My first impression of the room was that it was 1. quite small 2. there was no platform bed like in the pictures 3. the tv was not centered over the bed and did not move so it was hard to see 4. there was a HUGE stain on the carpet that was a bit gross 5. and the view from our hotel window was of a back alley and air conditioning vent. We called downstairs and the girl was very nice but there were no rooms to switch to that night so we had to wait to switch rooms the next day. The process of changing rooms was easy and they did it while we were out enjoying the sites the next day. Our second room was MUCH better but the noise from the street was a bit loud but it was worth it to have some sort of view. The shower was a great, rainfall fixture. The bed was super comfortable and the sheets were nice, not scratchy. When we came back the third night there was another big party going on or maybe it was just crowded with people from the public because the bar is open to the public. The bar tender wasn't too friendly and the drinks were way over-priced even for New York. My boyfriend had a crown on the rocks for $10!!!! He had had one earlier at Tavern on the Green for the same price and it was double the size! The whole scene was a bit over the top with people either all decked out in crazy trendy clothes or virtually naked running around the indoor pool area. I was a bit dissapointed that we couldn't enjoy these ammenities without all the chaos but if you like that sort of scene then this place is for you. It is very trendy and a bit overpriced for what it is but hey it is New York afterall. I wouldn't stay here again but I would recommend it to my single friends who are looking for a little nightlife (and over-priced cocktails) to go with their hotel stay.On a scale of one to ten I'd give it a five maybe a six at the most.

<Content>Absolutely fabulous dahling!!!!! Just back from NYC and stayed at the fabulous hotel QT. First visit to New York so didn't know what standard to expect from the hotel but I was not disappointed. We arrived and were welcomed to check in even though we were early, got an upgrade and settled in to our luxurious pad for the week (compared to any other hotel i've stayed in previously anyway!) Room was really spacious, extremely clean and the bed was so comfy after a long days travelling. Expected to hear a lot of noise going by some reviews but it was really quiet, our room was at the back and on the ninth floor so we had no problems sleeping. The continental breakfast was really good - only thing that was missing was bacon (one can dream!). Maid service every day - who changed sheets and towels and replenished any shower items we has used - the room was always spotless when we came back from a day sightseeing - a point was even folded in the toilet paper - so impressed! One regret is that we did not make more use of the pool, only managed one dip but it was great - sauna and steam room were off at the time which was a pity. NYC is great even if you stayed in a dumpster but the hotel qt made our stay complete and we will definitely be booking up there when we go return.

<Content>brilliant unique hotel! Was in New York for the first time, took my boyfriend as a surprise for his 30th birthday, as he always wanted to go to NYC. Wanted a unique hotel, that he would always remember!Staff were fabulous, really friendly, and the guy who was on mezzanine level at breakfast, always had a smile, and friendly tips about NYC. The breakfast was great, all you really needed, lasted us until lunchtime, and if you wanted something sweet you could always buy it at the kiosk (front desk).The empty fridge in the bedroom was a great idea, we always had ours fully stocked with water, which you need after a hectic day of trekking around the city!The bar was very relaxed, and was good to have tourists and locals mixing in the bar..Bedroom was big enough... come on you are in New York, how much time are you really going to be in your room??!!! The main point is the bed was really comfy!!Shower was fantastic... wet room effect... We stayed on the 3rd floor in a room nearest the street, yes there was noise, but not much as I expected for the city that doesn't sleep!! Plus we were so close to Times Square it was unbelievable!Checked out at 12, and the staff held our luggage until 6pm, when we got the town car to the airport (which the staff had kindly booked for us).Lets just say all in all, we had a fantastic time at QT and NYC in general, and my boyfriend hasn't stopped raving about the best birthday present ever, and this brilliant hotel we stayed in!

<Content>Amazing Hotel We stayed in Hotel QT for 3 nights at the start of June and it was a great hotel.. My boyfriend had booked our trip to New York as a surprise for my 30th birthday. I didn't know where we were staying and when we arrived we were not disappointed. We had a deluxe room so the size was good, probably about the same size as hotel rooms in the UK. I wouldn't have minded a smaller room though as it was the location that was the best thing about this hotel. It is so close to times square, turn right out of the hotel and it is a 30 second walk, amazing! As everyone says, the beds are very comfy and the continental breakfast was nice. ( there is also a very nice deli next door to the hotel)We were on the 7th floor so were not disturbed by any noise. We also had some drinks in the bar which was really nice.The only thing is we had to pay about another $30 a night, on top of the advertised room rates, in taxes etc. The small print on our booking said there may be some extras but we didn't expect it to be so much.Apart from that I would definately stay here again on our next trip to NYC

<Content>Fabulous-What a deal!! My husband and I stayed at Hotel QT last week. This was our first trip to NYC. We couldnt have been more pleased with our stay. First of all, we were told check-in was at 3:00pm and as soon as we arrived at 12:00pm we were given a room. I had seen pictures of the rooms on the internet so I knew they were on the smaller side, but I was impressed! It was just enough room for the two of us. Besides, we werent in the room but to sleep, rest for literally 30 mintutes at a time and take a shower in the morning! The beds are awesome! The beds made it very hard to get up in the morning because they are so comfortable with the down feather comforter, pillow top mattress and down feather pillows. They continental breakfast was great every morning. They had fresh crossiants and bagels, orange juice and the best coffee! What a deal! If you like to relax at the end of the day, the pool and the bar were always hopping around 6:00 pm- until. The staff at Hotel QT was excellent. Everytime we needed ANYTHING they were eager to help- from directions, extra cups in the hotel room and especially places to eat! The location couldnt be better! As soon as you walk out the door and turn right, you are IN Times Square!!! Location! Location! Location! On our last day at Hotel QT, we checked out first thing in the morning to have one last day of site seeing and the hotel staff happily held our luiggage for us and had a town car service waiting for us at the end of the day to take us to the airport. Awesome!! If you are looking for a bargain with a chic and modern atmosphere, this is the place! Hotel QT made our first trip to NYC very relaxing. We cant wait to visit again!!

<Content>Fabulous!!! My friend and I arrived at 6am and the staff gladly held our luggage for us and told us to call at noon to see if our room would be ready early and it was. The staff were so friendly and helpful. The room was very trendy and everything we expected! The bed was heaven as was the shower! We couldn't believe how close to Times Square we actually were. Night life at the hotel is great. Plan at least one night to enjoy the lounge and pool. There is a DJ on weekends and it is a real party without going anywhere. The continental breakfast was nice as well. Our room was on the 8th floor and was surprisingly quiet. We would stay at Hotel QT again in a New York minute!

<Content>Great for what you pay The hotel is in a great location right next to times square. It has a kind of budget-trendy and friendly vibe to it. The people at the front desk don't have the attitute you sometimes find at new york hotels. I paid for the lowest category room but somehow got upgraded to one of the penthouses. I guess it was big by new york standards, would be tiny in any other city, i couldn't imagine how big the other rooms are. I'm not really picky about room size though considering it was only $200/night. The bed makes up for most if not any minor problems the hotel has. Sooo comfortable with egyptian cotton sheets and the room temperature is always perfect. Everything in the room is minimal and clean which I appreciated. The pool and bar area was nice too. I'm trying to think of anything I didn't like about it but for the price it was almost perfect. Oh yeah the rain showers are also amazing. I recommend it if you're looking for an inexpensive hotel that is also clean and well located.

<Content>Third time Not a charm Visited the Hotel QT for the third time in early May. In the past, we have enjoyed this hotel. This time, our experience was not a pleasant one. Our first room was facing the street. Very noisey - at 3am we were awakened by the garbage trucks. The noise continued for at least a half hour. The next day, we moved to the back of the hotel. Unpacked again, only to find our tv didn't work! Our third room was very nice and much larger than the first two but again there were major problems so we moved to the Millenium accross the street. The hotel is in a great location but the security is very lax. Rarley is there any one watching the door when the guest come and go after 10pm. None of the staff wear any type of identification which can be a problem if somone knocks on your door saying they are with the hotel. The hallways are very dark and as a woman, I was not comfortable walking alone at night to my room. The elevators take forever so we often chose to use the stairs - at least we got our exercise.The front desk staff can be quite rude if questioned in any way, however, the manager was very professional when addressing our problems. The location is great, but if you are a woman alone, or with a friend, I would encourage you to stay at a more security conscious hotel.If you have any questions, feel free to email me.Enjoy New York!

<Content>What a QT Just returned from a fantastic 6 night break in New York - partly thanks to the Hotel QT. What a cool place. Having stayed in many boutique hotels I found most of them to be a disappointment. However, the QT was better than I expected. I had read a couple of negative reviews before I left so wasn't sure what I was going to get. I requested a room high up in the hotel and that's what I got. We were on the 12th floor in room 1205. Nicely layed out room. Bigger than I thought. Huge shower head which made you want to stay in there for hours. Big comfy bed, flatscreen TV, cool magazines and a nice little cushioned seating area by the window. Ok it could have done with a few little extra's such as somewhere to hang your towels, a proper wardrobe door rather than a curtain and some drawers but they aren't essentials. You can get by easily enough without them.The only thing I found slightly odd was the shower and the toilet being in the same little area. They were quite far apart but if you are in the shower and your partner needs the loo it could be a bit tricky. We did however have a sliding divider to close off the shower / toilet room but it might have been better to have the toilet separate. But then to be honest we actually never needed the shower and toilet at the same time so it was fine. Our shower / toilet area also had 2 massive windows which were frosted halfway up. My boyfriend was concerned that people from the neigbouring office blocks would see you showering etc. but I am pretty sure they would have to be at a very strange angle in their office to see you. Plus once the shower is going the glass would steam up anyway and when you were sat down on the loo there's no way anyone could see. And in the whole time I was there I never actually saw any people moving around in the offices anyway. So if I couldn't see them ! Personally I found it really cool to have a shower and be looking out the window with the sun shining through and the sounds of the streets of Manhattan outside. Some friends of ours were in the room opposite us 1206 and their room wasn't as well designed as ours / seemed slightly smaller (even though it was also an E sized room). So I think maybe some people strike more lucky with their room than others. They also seemed to have much more of a ledge around the bed than us as our bed ran width wise along the window and theirs was lengthwise with the headboard backing against the window. So it made it quite difficult to navigate getting out of bed. Lots of young media / fashion types stay here so the bar / pool / sauna area are all very cool in their design. The staff were all wonderful and helped you with anything you needed - restaurant recommendations / directions etc. None of the snobbery or attitude I've experienced with more expensive hotels. In fact on the day we arrived they were having some cake in the bar area for employee of the month and offered us all a slice which was a nice touch.Breakfast could be better given there's so much fantastic food in New York but it's fine for what you pay. And if you don't like breakfast at the hotel then there's always a couple of nice deli's just to the left of the hotel - Cranberries and Dunhills.You couldn't fault the hotel for location either. Literally a minutes walk from Times Square in one direction and a couple of minutes walk in the other direction to lots of the big stores on 5th Avenue. At the end of the day if you are worried about the size of your room when you are in a city like New York then all I can say is get a life!Ah - one final thing I would point out is that when checking out they take the money and then give you the itemised bill. So make sure you ask for a print out before you pay or at least make sure you double check because the room rate we had been quoted / booked wasn't what they charged us. They charged us 50 dollars per night more. Thankfully my boyfriend remembered I had mentioned it was 230 dollars per night not 280 and I had a print out of the reservation confirmation with me. You should remember to do this too. I spoke to them they refunded the difference immediately including the percentage of tax. Thing is when checking in they asked me to sign a slip agreeing the rate of 280. At the time I said it was wrong so I had it amended. However, this was obviously not put onto the computer system.

<Content>The best deal in Times Square Stayed at the hotel Qt for three nights end of April. Booked on Quikbook @ $ 200 per nite and received a catagory E room..(see descriptions on their website). This hotel is fantastic.The rooms were SO clean and well kept. The bed was the most comfotable we have slept in besides our own!!! Location can't be beat!! The staff was very friendly and helpful...even used the hotel computer to print my boarding pass!!!  There are just a couple of things worth noting...The bed is a tight fit in the room and could be a problem for an older couple to get in and out of. The walk-in shower..although fantastic has no door or curtain...might be an issue for some people....but for me personally it was kinda cool to lay in bed and watch my Love take a shower!!! :) You gotta check this place out!!!

<Content>I Now Have an Answer I go to New York once or twice a year, and am often asked where do you stay? At last I have an answer!I stayed in the smallest plan room they have (Option F), and it was the largest room I have had in New York (having stayed at Hotel 41 at twice the price, Hotel 17, Quality Inn, Larchmont, Portland Square, and also some nasty shared-bathroom places from back when I was poorer). The QT was also SO much better.It may not be nicer than some 400 or 500 a night rooms (I wouldn't know!) but it was the nicest room I've had yet. The staff were very very courteous and friendly; I felt very welcomed. The location, obviously, is brilliant. I stayed in room 607 and could hear street noise (hello, it's New York) but no bar noises, plumbing, neighbours, etc., and of course fell right to sleep on the wonderful bed.Obviously, depending on your needs, you may or may not like this hotel. For instance, I like very much that the room cost $175. That's a big deal for me, it means I can stay for a week instead of a couple of days. I like having my own bathroom, but don't care if it's huge (this one is, but it didn't matter to me). I love that there's a table with wheels instead of a desk--I was able to customize my space, move the cushions to a different part of the ledge, it felt very organic.I don't mind no bellman, but maybe you do. I don't mind no shower curtain, again, maybe that's important to you. No drawers? Fine, I put my socks and unmentionables in my suitcase and tucked it under the ledge around the bed.What else? You get a shampoo, conditioner, and rainbath, but no lotions and such. (Fine.) Free wireless internet (why don't more places do this? I hate getting nickled and dimed on this stuff!). A 24 hour kiosk so if you realise you're dead thirsty at 3:00 in the morning, but for some reason don't want to don a jacket and hit an exterior deli, you're fine. (This is obviously less necessary in New York, but I've been in many a hotel where I'd sorely wished for this, and always think it's a good addition.) Free magazines in your room (real magazines, not collections of ads for attractions and stores).I had a view across the street; it was fine. I read a lot of complaints about views in New York hotels, and I wonder at the mentality of the reviewer. Only one quarter of the walls are going to face forward, you know. Most of the windows are going to point at an adjacent wall of the neighbouring building, or perhaps an interior courtyard at the back. People will complain about anything!The only shabbiness was an unfortunate bit of wooden baseboard in the shower area, not a good idea, and it was starting to go. And I do think it would have been useful to have a towel rack near the toilet (I don't really like using one towel then dumping it on the floor, I'm a recycler!)But all in all, from a cost/benefit ratio, this is my new hotel from now on. I'm sold. Cheers to the QT!

<Content>Cracking Hotel Stayed 3 nights - 27th april to 29th 2006. Just got back. Hotel is simple, no frills but has everything you need. Helpful staff, a swimming pool thats 24 hour, with people having a few drinks later at night in it, nice bar (pricey drinks though - 2 GT and three bottles beer was $58!!!)( I suggest if you sleep earlier then ask for a room higher up as it could be noisy on the floor above the bar I think). If you request a room with a bathroom door on for those sharing with mates, they were accomodating - Fantastic shower room with 2 overhead showerheads and side jet attachment. Bed was seriously comfy the best mattress ever, (and I have a prolapsed disc!) nice feather duvets and pillows, none of that blanket palava!.smallish but I have been in smaller travelodge rooms in the UK! but who is doing anything but sleep! (and all NYC hotels are pretty small rooms, space is premium).Nice breakfast included - bagels, eggs, coffee, yoghurt and fruit, cereals, just right. Go out of the hotel - turn right and you are abut a 35 second walk from Times square! the hotel though was not noisy. Restaurant tip - if you have some cash - go over the Brooklyn Bridge and to the River Cafe ,what a restaurant !!( and one of the oldest and most famous in NYC)- will cost you about 拢100 each and you need to reserve, but we got a table at the window with view right over manhattan skyline and the food was exquisite and the service 11/10. However, a good diner for a late brekkie on sundays is a must!!! Dinking generally expensive, but you walk so much you are in bed ealry anyway - get to the Empire state on your first morning if from UK - you will wake so early that you may as well get up eat breakfast at 7 and then avoid all queues it opens about 8am- you should see the rope queues they have set up there - you would waste the whole day queueing and that is NO exageration. Also when downtown at Liberty - locate the Ritz Carlton and go the their Rise bar on the 16th ish floor - get a nice cocktail (about 12 dollars) and enjoy the free view of liberty, hudson and Brooklyn Bridge......a total must! ( go before about 6 to get a table) ...all in all Fab simple hotel.

<Content>A prison cell would have been an upgrade We were sent to this hotel when they had to close a portion of the hotel we were originally booked into (The Paramount). After arguing with the idiotic manager at the Paramount about how unfair this was as we had booked theater tickets and dinner reservations based on staying there, we were handed $10 and told to take a cab to the QT.Never in my life have I seen a hotel room this small. I have stayed in many Boutique hotels as well as hotels in Europe, and none were ever as small as this room. I had to go out into the hall just to change my mind. I have never seen a hotel room that had no chairs in it or where you could only watch the TV if you were lying in bed. The small ledge that runs around the bed (So the person on the window side can walk off the bed without having to step on or over the other person) was truly annoying as it is quite possible to slip on it while getting out of bed in the dark.The fact there were no drawers to put clothes in and only 6 hangers in the closet were a problem as well. The bathroom was tiny as well and the sliding door that either covered the toilet area or the shower depending on which one (Never both at the same time) you wanted covered was not a good idea.Fortunately for us, Priceline was able to refund us for one of our two nights as they agreed that the Paramount should not have moved us. Unfortunately, it was Easter weekend, and were unable to find another hotel in the Times Square area that had any rooms available for us to move to.One positive thing to say is that the staff were all very friendly and accomidating for anything you would ask of them.Not only would I never stay in at this hotel again, but we will never stay at the Paramount or any other property owned by the Sol Melia chain.

<Content>Good, but not that good Perhaps if I hadn't seen so many really good reviews for this hotel I wouldn't have felt slightly let down and would have given it 4/5. We paid $160 for the cheapest room type and I actually felt the room was a reasonable size, perhaps not by general USA standards, but I've had worse in London and I didn't feel claustrophobic at all. The bed was comfortable and I liked the platform which provided seating. The shower and toilet facilities were good and the neutrogena toiletries were pleasant. The main bugbear though was the noise, which was pretty much unbearable on most nights. We were on the 4th floor and faced on to the street (even though I'd asked for a quietish room when I booked 5 months ago) and there was a constant noise of car horns, rubbish collection, lorries reversing etc. A film crew were based outside which didn't help as all their lorries kept coming and going all night as well. There was little to no noise from inside the hotel or from neighbouring rooms though. I didn't get to use the pool as it was closed for much of my stay without explanation or apology and the pool had been one of the main reasons for choosing this place. The breakfast was average. We ate breakfast out on a couple of days and in retrospect would have preferred to do this more. The service was efficient and we had no problems with checking in or out, but was a bit abrupt occasionally. Yes, the place looked good, but I guess I never really felt at ease in this place and NY is not short on other cool bars to visit rather than using the one in the hotel. The location was very convenient for transport but not necessarily for music, clubs etc and really what I want most from a hotel is a good night's sleep and I didn't get this.

<Content>Great bed! Great Location! No privacy!! The location could not have been better! Still, I have to admit I was fairly disappointed with my stay at the Hotel QT. Although the bed was amazing, little room was unbelievably small. The bathroom was bare as well. I find it difficult to understand the logic of putting a shower curtain over the closet area, but not one around the shower. The shower was just an open area to get wet. And I do mean open area. There was a very large window that made up the wall of the shower and although the glass was frosted, it was only half way done. It was very easy to see into the building next door. And if I could see out, then I know people could see in. Explain to me how no one thought to put a curtain or some blinds up on a window people a standing naked next to?? (will post pics soon) The hallway was dark and fairly dirty, but the room looked well kept. Not extremely clean, but not dirty enough to really complain. My biggest complaint was that the reservation desk was a bout a foot from the front of the building. It made checking in very crowded. Fortunately the very friendly service made up for that. All in all, not a bad little hotel (got a good price from Quikbook) but don't think I'll be staying there again.

<Content>Disappointed with Hotel QT I just came back from New York where I stayed at Hotel QT for 4 days. I must say that after all the good reviews raving this hotel I was expecting a much better place, that is, a great place.Well, it's true that the location is fabulous and so are the beds, very confortable. But that's it! Like some other reviewer said before, the hotel had a very nauseating smell the minute you enter. I really don't know if it's bleach or bleach with some ambience perfume they put but the fact is that it isn't pleasant at all and it smelled everywhere inside it.The rooms are tiny and so are the bathrooms, though I already knew that when I booked the room. But they could at least put some hanger or chair. I had no place to put a coat. When I entered the room after the maids had cleaned it I found my pajama on the floor twice. I had the same small bottles of shampoo and bath gel during the 4 days I stayed there. No one supplied any more toiletries or replaced them.Breakfast was very bland. Boiled eggs, green apples, bananas, cereal, bagels and muffins. But if they finished at 9.30 ( breakfast was served until 10 am) they wouldn't put anymore. It happened to me , I had no bagels or bread once.At midnight the noise from the garbage collection was awful and lasted for almost one hour. I was in the 7th floor and the noise was unbarable.I really can't understand why so many people rave this hotel and call it a gem. Not for me though! And paying 205$ a night plus taxes for a single room in this hotel was very overrated. Disappointing to say the least!

<Content>A+++ Hotel QT The Hotel QT was an excellent choice of hotel for my partner  I, on our first trip to NYC. After arriving late 1am on a Thursday morning, we were promptly checked in  assisted to our room. The room was small, a fact that we already knew, as we had seen the floor plans when making our reservations. The bed like everyone has mentioned was really, really comfortable. The breakfast in the morning was a great way to kick start the day, self service, fresh bagels, juice, coffe  ceral. The breakfast area was kept clean by the staff. We did use the pool, which was heated,  made for a relaxing way to wind down the afternoon. Its location was a major bonus for us as well, only 100 mtrs away was Times Square,  two blocks in the other direction was 5th Ave. Great hotel, great location, Young  hip!!

<Content>A hidden gem I checked into the QT for a four-night business stay - managing to hit the February blizzard at the same time - and was pretty impressed with the QT's cool rooms and friendly atmosphere. Service and communication? Not so much. Having read the Tripadvisor reviews about the noise from the pool downstairs, I specifically asked when I made my booking that I be allocated a room high-up in the hotel, as I needed all the sleep I could get. On arriving, I found I had a 4th floor room (this is a TALL hotel), and immediately asked if it could be changed; I was told to return the next morning and ask again, but when I did, I was told, eye-rollingly, that I should have asked the previous evening, but drop by again later, which I did, only to be told I should have asked someone different, but let me check... etc, etc. I was eventually moved to a fabulously peaceful 16th floor room on my final night, and was offered a bottle of wine to make up for the bags under my eyes, but beware: street side rooms are VERY noisy, especially if you're staying on the weekend! When I checked out, I was also charged at a different room rate to the one I'd booked over the internet; it worked out slightly in my favour, but did give me a moment's panic.That said, the QT's charm made up for any shortcomings - the funky rooms have free wifi, the beds are super-comfy, the complimentary breakfast is particularly good, and there is a (smaller than it looks on the website!) poolside bar. It's very good value, and the midtown location makes it convenient for getting around. No restaurant, but plenty of nearby eating options, as well as a comprehensive takeaway delivery menu in each room - a clever touch. All in all, I'd definitely go back.

<Content>First visit to New York This was our first time in New York and we had a great time, made even more memorable by the QT which we booked after seeing it mentioned in one of the Sunday broadsheets.Everything we had read in the reviews was largely correct.The hotel is chic, very well placed about 100 yards from Times Square. The pool adds to the atmosphere and it clearly attracts the beautiful people.The beds as stated elsewhere are great but mind your head on the bunks.A great and friendly experience in the city that doesn't sleep

<Content>And very hush hush This is a late review but I thought I should get on here and write on! Stayed in the QT for a long weekend just before Christmas. Check in was fast, pleasant. Luckily we had a deluxe room (hear the standard is very small) the bed was just lush, you could sink into it when you slept. We didn't spend much time in the hotel (as you shouldn't in new york) but when we did it was relaxing, the pool is very cool, complimentary breakfast. lcd tv, plenty of room for all our shopping! and the best thing is, it is a stones throw from times square. only problem is there is no door for the bathroom, a bit unusual. this is the perfect hotel if you like boutiques, modern design, and can get on by yourself without needing any help from the front desk. would love to return.

<Content>Not what expected From what I heard, i expected a lot more. Immediately upon entering, it smelled like bleach. When approaching the front desk, the staff did not acknowledge me for about a whole minute. When I finally spoke up, they pretended they didn't know I was there. The rooms are also very small. The whole experience was not what I thought it would be.

<Content>New Year's Eve, Great Place to Stay! I stayed here on New Year's Eve, it was the best choice I could have made! My husband and I arrived early, 11am, and our room was ready, check-in a breeze. Had tickets to the Planet Hollywood party, 1/2 block away. Could not have asked for a better location and room. While the rooms are not Ritz Carlton caliber, they are great for the price-point.If you are incredibly picky about your surroundings, don't stay in NYC. It's not the cleanest place on the planet. However, if location to tourist attractions are on your list, the Hotel QT can accomodate very nicely for half the price of full service hotels. Who needs 4 restaurants and room service when you have Times Square right out the front door? The pool was very crowded and the bar jumping all night long, but then again, it was New Year's Eve. The room was quiet, considering... The bathroom facilities and bed were comfortable and clean. Next time I go to NYC I will not hesitate to book the Hotel QT again.

<Content>Cute hotel and great location I stayed at the QT during the Christmas - New years week of 2005 with my wife. We both really liked the design and coziness of the property. Also, it is located just a 30 second walk from Times Square. The staff is helpful and there are deli's a minute away. Overall, I had a great time here and would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Book It Stay Here Trust Me! Listen, this is the best value in the best location to see and do everything in NYC. The breakfast is an excellent bonus, the pool a nice day ending treat, the staff amazing, the rooms cosy -small but useful space with nice washrooms and a great comfy bed. I have stayed all over the world-in NYC rates are insane-HOTEL QT gives you value and thats tough to come by in NYC. Trust me, I am picky, believe me, Hotel QT---you're not sure-now you are BOOK IT !

<Content>QT is perfect I would recommend this hotel to anyone with a sense of adventure and sense of humor. This hotel is probably not for the stuffy business traveler used to a typical bedroom with awful bedspread and curtains. The rooms are small, but feel more spacious as the bed is on a raised platform and extremely comfortable. The flat screen TV works with the space constraints installed on the wall across from the bed. The bathroom is actually enormous with enough counter space for two. We had a room facing off the street and did not hear much street noise from the 11th floor. We arrived on a Friday and witnessed the pool party chaos on our way back in from our night out. Don't miss this party. We were too pooped to participate but it sure looked like fun. The breakfast was just enough to give you the fuel for the day. The kiosk is perfect for a late night snack or drink. Who needs a minibar anyway?I'd stay here again in a second. We got a $135 rate for a standard room.

<Content>Excellent modern contemporary hotel Loved staying at the QT! If your after somewhere with modern decoration, ultra stylish bar and pool area and superb location you can't go wrong! The location was fantastic, half a block from Times Square. The room was excellent, ours was bigger than some of the photos posted, i guess it's the luck of the draw on that. Although I did request a room on one of the higher floors before we arrived after reading some other reviews about travel noise. We were on the 10th floor so it was pretty quiet. As other reviews say the bed was mega-comfy.The pool and bar area's are the highlight of the hotel. Great to relax in the pool and sauna in the day, even better to enjoy the bar after a night out!Also loved the breakfast - but watch out for the swinging chairs!If you a young couple or group I would say you will love staying at the QT.

<Content>A Great Place to Sleep at a Great Price The Hotel QT is no frills, yet is very rewarding considering I expected nothing but a place to sleep at a great price while I worked at a tradeshow. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of staff and food and music for the complimentary breakfast. The receptionist was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was VERY quiet, and I got a great nights' sleep for each of the nights I was there, which says a lot since I am always anxious during tradeshows. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was spacious. I was pleased! I am very happy to have booked this through Tablet Hotels, a hotel booking website with a sophisticated layout and design.

<Content>What a great place to stay in NY I had just recently spent a weekend in New York to see some shows and get some of those after holiday bargains. I found QT via the internet and was impressed by the pictures, so I booked a room. To my surprise the pictures did not do the hotel justice. The lobby,pool and bar were amazing, what a great design. The pool was the best part, so relaxing and heated to 90 degrees I thought for a second I was at a day spa instead of a hotel in Times Square. I plan on staying at hotel QT whenever I visit New York.

<Content>QT was great The QT is a great unique hotel just close enough to everything to be convenient, yet just far off the beaten path that it seemed world's away from the hustle of Times Square. Only a 10 minute walk from Grand Central also. The room was very well laid out and clean, and they even upgraded me to a deluxe without even having to ask. The pool/bar area is a very special place to relax and unwind...a great idea that might very well, and should catch on elswhere. I will definitely be returning!

<Content>Modern budget minimalism that works This is what a hotel would look like if Ikea built one, inexpensive but modern minimalism design employed well. Do print out your reservation to get the rate you booked. Parking is $25 a day on the next street with a coupon from the hotel.When you walk in the check-in counter and gift shop are smartly condensed together on your left. The hotel lobby is a play on levels, the glass enclosed pool is a few feet above floor level and the bar is a few feet below. There's stadium seating next to the pool and on the Friday night we were there, it was spilling over with twenty-somethings bouyed on cocktails from the pass through window to the bar.Although the web site gives the impression that each bed has a flat panel, there is only one and it's could be bigger, keeping budgets in mind it's fine. The DVD player is underneath the bench seating. The closet has nice thick steel hangars, no drawers in the room but plenty of space to store stuff under the bed. The layout of the bathroom for the king w/bunk is spacious enough to move around easily.The bathroom has a long counter, more spacious than a many expensive hotels with an additional outlet. The lighting fixture is near the sink, moving it to the middle or adding another one would be a nice improvement. There is a sliding panel to cover the shower or the toilet. Didn't care for the above your head shower, yeah it looks cool but it isn't and it would be nice to have a towel hook nearby. The refrigerator with glass door is well chosen.We stayed in 1207. Though I could hear the garbage collection down below, I fell asleep within minutes and didn't wake until the alarm went off in the morning. Good bed and great bedding. Be a little careful with the bunk bed, it's big enough for adults but a little closer to the ceiling than an adult might be comfortable with.It could use a few tweaks, but is such an improvement over the traditional hotel that it will be on my short list again.

<Content>In the middle of everything!!!! Every once in a while you find a place not off the beaten path, but under the radar of everything around it. This is the case of the QT! This hotel is located less than one block from Times Square, and is substantially cheaper than the larger hotels that reside in Times Square, I paid $275.00 for for their premium (I think that they called it a B room) room, but they did have rooms starting at $175.But this hotel has style, and it is evident in it's design. When you look at the larger hotels in the area (Millenium, Hilton, Marriott Marquis) they now all loiok the same, and have become the standard. The Hotel Qt seems to be designed off a hostel but a chic neuvo hostel. The rooms are minimalist but cozy, and well thought out with space saving in mind. There are no mini-bars, but there is a fridge and the front desk sells everything you need to stock your own mini-bar that includes items such as Champagne, hard liquor, beer, and snacky food items as well.The best feature of this hotel is the bar and pool area. It fills up with uninhibited 20 somethings that end up in the pool. This was amazing to see, it quite literally started out as a flock of poeple that started out at the bar and then after a few drinks they bought bathing suits from the Front Desk area and were off to the pool. It was a real party and not at all rowdy as it may sound. Also apparently there were local celebrities there, actors from the local broadway shows.Keegan at the bar (one of the hotels greatest assests, by the way) told me that the bar itself every once in a while confirms that people have their birthday parties here, and what was going on in and around the bar/pool area. Apparently it was one of the actors from Rent. All in all, I do alot of business in the city and this place is right up the alley (litterally) when it comes to location price and atmosphere.

<Content>Great Experience We really enjoyed the QT. The rooms were large and the bed was really comfortable. Also, the rooms have wireless online access.The hotel is not Full Service so don't expect doormen, room service, etc. Nevertheless, I loved the hotel and the value.

<Content>A Chic  Now, I'm a savvy traveler, and a huge fan of the boutique hotels. I've stayed in many chic abodes across the world. But, I've never found something quite like the hotel QT. It does not carry your typical snobbish attitude, characteristic of most boutique style hotels, but at the same time it's cool enough to have an attitude with anyone who walks thru it's doors, if it so chooses. It chooses not to. You almost miss it's entrance as you walk down the busy and rather unspectacular Times Square street. It's truly a hidden gem. One immediately feels transformed as he/she walks inside. Front desk agents smile and greet you, hospitality often missed out on in the average hotel these days. Once checked in, one finds his/her way to the elevator, passing a unique view into what looks a sanctuary for pool goers. I learn later that this pool sanctuary is accompanied by a sultry steam room and sauna. There would be more to explore here, but to my room I go.Everything you need, but nothing more in the room. Simple, no frills. Very refreshing to have just the essentials. A practical design, but design there still is. Sleek bathroom counter, roomy shower (no bathtub), inviting bed. Perfect sleep.Cocktail hour. There is a note from the GM to join the poolside fun. More friendly employees greet me as I enter the bar. A Tuesday night and you can still find a charming crowd in the bar. First, I enjoy a glass of complimentary champagne, and then order what my own taste buds desire. A worthy excursion before I meet friends for dinner. I will definitely be suggesting this hotel to those I know and don't. It's quite a unique experience. Again, don't expect frills and royalty...it doesn't fit this humble abode. But expect fun, expect friendly, expect sensual, expect diversion from the norm, expect all that you need and want, but nothing excessively more.

<Content>Peaceful getaway from the hustle and bustle This was my first trip to NYC. I was a little timid about staying in Times Square but thought that this was a once in a lifetime oppurtunity so I wanted to make the most of it. hotel QT is the perfect Oasis from the crowds, and noise in Time Square. I found it peaceful. I sat by the pool all day on a rainy afternoon and read my book. The rooms were spotless, the staff accomadating, and the breakfast yummy. I did a lot of research prior to coming and QT offered the best rate. I am more than pleased with my stay. Ask for Gina in reservations, she was very helpful when I made my reservation.

<Content>Excellent Location, Good Value for Minimialist Accomodations Overall we were very satisfied with the QT. As others have mentioned, the mid-town location is just half a block from Times Square, and is ideal for most tourist activities. It is very convenient to Broadway, Rockefeller Center  Radio City, Fifth Ave, and St. Patrick's, and is a short cab or subway ride to downtown and uptown locations. The property itself does try to present itself as trendy in a minimalist sort of way. The bar is located beyond the lobby and half a floor below the adjacent swimming pool, which is seperated by large windows. While visually this makes for an interesting space, a strong chlorine odor was quite noticeable in both the lobby and the bar.The rooms are small as is typical for value oriented hotels in the city, but are very efficiently designed. We stayed in a corner room on the 8th floor with twin platform beds positioned perpendicular to each other along outer walls of the room, with a small flat screen TV that swiveled to kinda allow both occupants to view it. The only other furnishings were a small pedestal table, and a dorm style refrigerator. At the opposite end of the room was a large tiled shower with a great rain shower fixture, but modest travelers should be aware it is completely open to the room with no curtain or door. The toilet is in a separate enclosed space next to the shower with a closable door. There was also a good sized vanity/mirror and closet bar for hanging clothes that could be concealed behind a sliding curtain. The condition of the room was above average and clean. We found the beds to be very comfortable, but most surprising were how quiet the room was given the proximity to the hustle and bustle of Times Square. We seldom heard disruptive street noise, and never heard anything from adjacent rooms. Another big plus is free wireless Internet access from all the rooms. The design proved to be very comfortable despite the small footprint, although as others have noted expect to live out of your suitcase since the only storage space is for hanging clothes. However, for the busy tourist that is looking for a clean and comfortable place to stay with a great location and a competitive price, the QT is a great value.

<Content>Nice but pricey Our 5 1/2 yr old daughter had surgery at Roosevelt and after two nights in the apartment the hospital arranged for us we decided to try QT for our last night after seeing it on the Travel Channel. We called that morning and they said the room would be ready and we could check in early. By time we got there (30 minutes) that was not the case and they were going to put us in a smaller room. They kept our bags while we went for a doctor's appointment and while we were out they called to say we could have the original room, so it was a nice effort. We stayed in an A room and our daughter loved the bunk bed. Up and down, up and down the whole time. If she was any younger I would have been a bit leery about the height and ladder but we were glad she was having a good time. The pool looked great but we didn't have suits and our daughter had stitches. I didn't care for the dark hallways, it just made it feel dingy but the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. I did keep hearing trash trucks outside through the night. We stayed in 1207. It seems they are raising rates so make sure you have a printout of any online reservations. We paid $300 but they originally said it would be $340 but online it shows $295 which still seems pricey for not even getting a coffee maker in room. The gentleman handling the breakfast was very courteous and tentative and it was a nice relaxing way to start the day.

<Content>Bed Bugs and Dogs My fiancee and myself stayed at The Hotel QT on one of our many trips to New York. I was aware that this hotel was considered a budget hotel, however the level of cleanliness was shocking.When we arrived we were unhappy with the cleanliness of the room, we reported this to the front desk-shop. Who with another couple of chews of her gum, said well be right on it.We came back a few hours later , it had not been done. The toilet was dirty, the duvet cover was stained and there were crumbs on the floor.The next morning we woke up to find bites on our arms and legs. we went to a pharmacy and the pharmachist indeed say that they looked like bed bug bites.We returned to Hotel QT, contacted the duty managerShe said they would take care of it. we returned to the room and decided that we would like to move rooms as we did not feel that thay had really done anything.We were told that the Duty mnager in the morning shoould have moved us , but we now could not be moved as they were full.The next morning again we awoke with more bug bites.Again we spoke to the duty manager who again could not move us as they were full.The last night we returned to the hotel after dinner to be refused entry to the hotel bar as they were having a private party.The party consisted of about a hundred trendy new yorkers in there dirty outdoor shoes walking around the hotel pool, which has a sign no outdoor shoes, very hygienic.Lastly on departure we met the general manger and her Dog a lovely big pointer, he was running around the pool area licking the pool water, that i had been swimming in 24 hours before. The place would be closed down in Ireland. The have no notion on customer care,the staff appear lazy and untrained, with no hygiene skills.dont go as its not cheap, not worth it.

<Content>Not worth 1/2 what I paid I realized that they are trying to be artsy and hip - but they could have at least used quality materials. The overall shape of the place was average to poor: frayed carpet, dented and scuffed walls, etc. The room fixtures reminded me of the cheap junk you buy at Ikea, not to mention the size of the room meant that I had to crawl over my girlfriend to get out of the bed. I would not stay there again, and I would not recommend it to anyone. The staff was not helpfull and since they didn't ask if I enjoyed my stay - I can only assume that they did not care.

<Content>Cool! The hotel was in a great location. We could walk to all the plays and easy to get to MTA. The breakfast was so good! A great way to start the day. The room was small but since it was just my daughter and I it was fine. We did not stay in the room much. My only complaint is there is no where to put clothes but the closet and no hooks in the room. It was fine for what we needed. It had a safe and frig. which we used. My daughter loved the pool. Well worth the price. Would stay again!

<Content>Great, Great, Great! Hotel QT was GREAT! The location is central to both Times Square and Rockefeller Center. The room was wonderful. You don't even spend much time enjoying it in the busy city of NY. The breakfast was a great, easy start to a busy day. The rooms were clean, spacious, and provided everything that we hoped for. We stayed in room 1102. It was quiet, big, and plenty of room for two. NY is a great city!! Enjoyed our broadway show the best of anything. We stood in line at the TKTS booth for 2 hours...but it was well worth the wait. Great places to eat...Sweet and Tart (Chinatown), Joe Allens (Restaurant Row before a show), Lombardis (Little Italy). Reasonable places that provided great food. Wished we were still in NYC!!

<Content>Had a fantastic time at the trendy QT We could not believe the crowd outside the QT when we arrived late on a Friday night, but when we stepped in it was clear this was a happening place. They were partying in the pool, the music was thumping and the bar was calling us to join in, which of course we did. A great place to stay, the location is excellent just off Times Sq and a short stroll to 5th Avenue, the breakfast lounge is great (staff superb), our room was small but the bed one of the best we have slept in (albeit for about 3 hrs a night) but a delight none the less. We had a great time and much preferred the atmosphere at this small boutique hotel than the larger ones you find in NY. Not where I would stay with my daughter or parents, but with friends its a blast. Note: If with friends ask for a closed bathroom (basically a door on the loo).

<Content>Kicked Butt!!! I've traveled around the world alot and I've stayed in many cool, and hip places. My overall experience with the QT was OUTSTANDING!!!!! I am a very down to earth and not caught up in the trendy world but I do appreciate a great place to stay and hotel QT is exactly that  a Very Cool Place. Oh and by the way the bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on and try not to miss the complimentary breakfast it was fantastic.

<Content>Many problems We stayed in this Hotel last November for one night. We booked from France for one night as the hotel is very well located in Times square and has a indoor swimming pool cross the bar.When we check in the room was not ready but as it was a early check in no problem. You can leave your luggage and come back later.We got a room as mentionned on the websibe on the fith floor with a note on the bed mentionned that the pool and the bar were closed this evening for a private party.Disappointment....When we came back after the dinner , it was impossible to sleep in the room as it was very noisy. The lady in the reception was very unhepfull and just said that it was not her problem if the noise is coming from outside...In fact it is the aircondionning just up the room ...When we check out after a very bad night we paid cash and mentionned that they have our Visa credit card.  No problem the credit card was just as guarantee for answer..and no invoice in return. I requested it.When we came back in France , surprise.... our account was debited for the night in the QT hotel via our Visa credit card.I will never stayed in this hotel anymore.No service. Staff incompetent.Room just ok.

<Content>A mixed bag We stayed the week of Thanksgiving. Our reservation was made 8 months prior - in March 2005. 3 days before arrival, we called the hotel to confirm our reservation and room type: king bed with bunk for 2 adults and one teenager. All was well, or so we were told. Upon arrival (after a long day traveling from the west coast) we were told we had a room with 2 twin beds. When we expressed our surprise and dismay, we were told we had only made the reservation for 2 people. That statement in and of inself annoyed us no end, and we were then told there was nothing they could do, they had no other room for us. End of discussion (take it or leave it) as far as the clerk was concerned. Miraculously, after presenting a copy of our emailed room reservation confirmation, a different clerk helped us, and while we were crammed into a king room with cot for the first night (which they really should have given us a partial refund for), we were moved to a larger room (1207) king bed with twin bunk the following day. Luckily, the attitude we encountered that first evening did not extend to the rest of our stay. We found the staff to be satifactory, and the hotel manager (Tiffany) was more than helpful when my husband had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital one morning. Breakfast was provided, which made mornings easy to manage. The room was adequate, though already showing signs of wear, including an ample amount of mold on the tile grout in the shower (UGH).  We loved the layout, though there easily could have been some drawers added to the room without compromising the design. No, there is not one single drawer in the room. It was a pain to pull our suitcases out from under the bed whenever we wanted any of our folded clothing. Bathroom has a long counter (probably 7' or more long) which could have been a great feature. Unfortunately there is only one little light right over the sink, so that renders about 5' of the counter space completely and utterly useless. I am very grateful we had a room on an upper floor. I cannot imagine staying on the 3rd or 4th floors with the loud music from the lounge area. Even though we always went to bed later than 1, the bar was still loud most evenings after that. Location was terrific for us, as we has show tickets all but one night of our stay. So easy to walk back to the hotel late at night. Subway is just a couple of short blocks away. As is shopping on 5th Ave. Easy to walk to Central Park and other sights. All in all a good stay. However, I cannot express enough how much the attitude we encountered while checking in jaded our impression of this hotel. Would we stay here again? With reservation. Would we recommend it to others? Likely not.

<Content>Good location ... Great location - near Citibank and Starbucks, not far from subway.Front desk staff was very courteous. We checked in early but couldn't get our room until later in the afternoon. When we returned to get our keys, we found that we had been upgraded. On the day we left, we checked our bags at the front desk and returned several times to add items to our bags. The bags were brought out each time by a very pleasant employee and then returned to storage.Our room was clean but small and would be off-putting to some because of the lack of door to shower (you can see into shower from the room). Also, if there is a party in the pool area, the noise from the speakers reverberates in some rooms.All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would return.

<Content>Great value for money This is a cool little hotel with an exellent location just off times square. Rooms are not huge, but they've made good use of the space - once our cases were pushed under the bed there was plenty of room to move around - after all, you don't go to New York to stay in your hotel room! The breakfast was also great - the best free breakfast I've experienced in the US.We found the service very helpful an polite. We reported a broken lightbulb on the first morning and it was fixed by the time we got back later that day. The reception staff organised a car back to the airport for us. We also found the maids very friendly, and the bar staff. The bar wasn't cheap, but pretty much on a par with other local bars - the setting was much nicer than the local Irish pubs!One nice touch - we were there for Thanksgiving and came back that day to find free mineral water and alka seltzer in the room to help with the morning after!

<Content>Great stay at the QT Just returned from a 3 day weekend getaway at the QT. My husband and I (both in late 30s) were very happy with the hotel. Great modern design, very comfortable room, fantastic shower, surprisingly quiet even though our room was opposite the elevator (room 1002). Breakfast was very good. Location and value can't be beat! Front desk staff and housekeeping were so-so but you get what you pay for. All in all we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Different, Funky, Fun, Excellent Location First impressions, im in a newsagents not a hotel, but that is the attraction of the Hotel QT everything is a little different and quirky. The first night we stayed on the 3rd floor which was very noisy as it was so close to the street. We asked to be moved at 7am the next morning and immediately we were given a key to a room on the 6th floor to inspect it and see if it met our needs, any other hotel would not be impressed by negative feedback.The second room had two single deds and an open plan shower which was pretty daunting as I was sharing with my friend, however we laughed about it and agreed to sit on the bed that had no view of the shower when we had to use it.The breakfast was excellent and definately a very nice touch as we went to new york to do a lot of shopping and sightseeing it was great to leave the hotel with breakfast out of the way. We have been told of the location before but I never realised how brilliant it was. Come out of the hotel turn right go past O'Lunneys pub and a few steps later you are on time square, for parents out there at the corner is Swatch Watch and a couple of stores later is the amazing toysrus store. I will definately be back in new york next year and I will not hesitate in booking this amazing quirky hotel again.One tip, dont drink at the hotel bar, 2 glasses of wine set my friend and I back $20, it wasn't even good wine, but there is a nice Irish Bar next door called Connollys, which also does lovely food (but staff could use an injection of friendliness)Last but not least many hotels and restaurants could learn some lessons in genuine friendliness and good customer service from the staff at Hotel QT, I couldnt say enough good things about them 10 out of 10 to the great people working there.

<Content>A GREAT NYC Find What a find! Everything, from the courteous, friendly reception through the efficient check-out, was just terrific. We loved the spare---yet stylish--- look of the rooms. The bed, pillows, and linens were top notch. The room was very quiet; it was on the sixteenth floor. Six people could have partied in the very large shower. When I heard about an included continental breakfast, I imagined styrofoam cups, Lipton tea, and stale bagels. The reality was that there were multiple choices, including better-than-average muffins, several kinds of fresh fruit, actual croissants, cereals, Stonyfield Farm organic yogurt etc. One caveat is that in our friends' room the bed was oriented so that one would have to crawl over one's bed buddy if there was a need to arise during the night. I think this hotel is a great deal for the theater district, and the price ($165 through Quickbook) was good relative to other Times Square hotels. We would definitely make a return trip to the QT!

<Content>Rude people at the QT Bartender in the hotel was a jerk and used strong language towards my wife and I. After complaining to the manager, she made us feel like it was our fault for requesting a drink around midnight.Don't call the hotel for rates, shop through Hotels or something similar for best rates. Another couple traveling with us got a cheaper rate by doing so, and the manager would not match their rate.OK location, 1/2 a block from time squ.Not sure if I would ever stay there again. There are a ton of hotels and I say, look elsewhere

<Content>Great Place for Many Reasons Spent the weekend there with another couple and we all were pleasantly surprised. Everything about the place is great--the comfortable bed, the surprisingly well-stocked breakfast buffet, the rate, the location. Cannot beat it, and we have stayed many places (Novotel, Sheraton, Marriott Marquis)

<Content>Great, Great, Great Recenty spent four nights at QT with my daughter. Read all the reviews before booking but still went with heart in mouth as this was our first time in NY and booking on internet. Shouldn't have spent time worrying arrived tired from the flight to a warm friendly welcome. We stayed in room 710 and was impressed as soon as we walked through the door, clean, bright and the air conditioning was an added bonus to a travel weary 44 and 18 year old. The room size was more than adequate in actual fact I was quite impressed by the size we also had plenty of hanging space for clothes, storage for our cases and an adequate seating arrangment set up on the bed surround and talking of the bed if I could have packed it and brought it home I would have I've never slept in such a comfortable bed as this one. The only down side to the room from my point of view would be the climb up onto the platform that the bed is on. Although very modern looking it is a rather high step up to get onto the bed and although I'm not quite infirm yet after a days hard walking and weary muscles a small step up onto the platform would have been helpful so on that note only wouldn't recommend this hotel if you do have leg or back problems could prove a little uncomfortable getting on and off the platform. The walk in shower was a delight and although there was only the one sliding door which either closed in front of the shower or toilet this never posed a problem for us. The housekeeper came in every day to change the towels and bedding and breakfast was more than adequate. The added bonus of course to the hotel apart from price is that it is slap bang on top of Times Square and although near to two Irish pubs and the noise to Times Square being constant during the night it was never enough to stop a good nights sleep. If you're looking for an affordable near to everthing hotel then this will be the one for you I certainly would go back again (and take a little ladder with me).

<Content>One of the best deals in the City If like me, you are used to staying in pretty exepnsive hotels in NY when work is paying (Soho Grand, 60 Thompson, Morgans, The Royalton), but have to somewhat downgrade your options for personal travel, the QT is a perfect compromise. I stayed for 6 nights recently on vacation and was very impressed by the trade off between design/quality and price. The rooms are basic, but nicely done, the beds are extremely comfortable and the pool/bar area is a nice touch (despite the smell of chlorine!). More than anything else though, I thought the staff were amazingly friendly and helpful, so much more efficient and less surly than the rude wannabe models/actors/whatevers that get recruited to work in the more premium NY boutique hotels. The staff at Schrager Hotels in particular could take some much needed customer service tips from the staff at the QT.

<Content>QT - NYC's hidden gem! My boyfriend and I stayed at the QT from 1-6th November. We were allocated room 1401 which was a decent enough size, very clean with no frills. We had read previous reviews about the QT on Trip Advisor and being budget conscious, we decided this was the one for us. After almost a whole day of travelling, the huge rain-like shower and a very comfortable though unconventional bed, were just what we needed. The staff were very very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. We understood the pool was being renovated and due to this, the normal dining area was shut off and breakfast was served in room 604 which was quite cramped but adequate. The food was good and a there was a good variety to choose from.The very hip and trendy hotel could perhaps have changed the layout of the beds. In our room one of us had to literally climb over the other to get out to use the bathroom in the night. Not a very well thought out aspect of the room. Though the cubby holes under the bed were perfect to store our bags. The safe, though rather bizarrely located in the bathroom was very useful to store our valuables and we were very glad of the air-con system which was extremely efficient.The QT is in an excellent location, has very friendly staff and is priced well for those on a budget. I'd definitely come back to this hotel on my next trip to NYC!

<Content>Great use of space I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights last week. It's a very small hotel, but they did a great job at maximizing the space throughout. The lobby, the pool, the bar and the rooms all were very small, yet sleek. The little breakfasts were good with zen-style music playing as you ate (not too great to help you wake up, but a pleasant way to start your day). The prices at the front desk are very expensive (I paid $6 for a call of Rolling Rock to bring up to my room). That seems a little much...for a can of beer! Location wise, it's perfect if you want to do the Times Square thing...it's only a 1/2 block away from all of the action! It was nice to be able to walk around at midnight and feel completely absorbed in the city. The room was great...no towel rack though. I had to hang my towel in the closet on the rod. I think the bed was the most comfortable bed that I'd ever slept in! I actually spent a lot of time there...All in all, I think it was a great little hotel and for the price (I paid $165), you can't beat it! I would definitely stay there again and suggest to others.

<Content>A tragically hip hotel Being less than a block from Times Square, Hotel QT is unmatched in its location. The hip design (a swimming pool in the lobby and a check-in counter that doubled up as a grocery store of sorts) will certainly appeal to the young.The room we stayed in, 1407, was very spacious. The fixtures were really modern and hip in design, it had a rain shower, Neutrogena toiletries, see-through refrigerator, in-room safe, LCD TV, cordless phone and really luxurious sheets.The safe in our room was locked in 'close' despite the door being left opened. It was a full 45 minutes and two phone calls to the front desk before a technician came along to rectify it. The LCD TV, though beautiful to look at, had a constant reception problem on some channels and the remote control was almost totally non-responsive. Perhaps it needed a battery change, but we didn't bother.There were absolutely no hooks of any kind in the bathroom area. Nowhere whatsoever to hang your towel as you're taking a shower. Perhaps hooks didn't match their hip design concept.Despite the minor flaws, we'd still recommend Hotel QT highly, for which other hotel can afford you the chance to have your breakfast at the bar?

<Content>Our New Hotel In NY We love this hotel! I can't say enough about it. We have stayed at the everywhere in NYC. We travel alot. This hotel is fantastic. #1-You can't beat the price#2-The rooms are a good size... have you ever stayed at the Paramount or the Hudson. Go there and TRY and complain#3-Fantastic Breakfast. Continental. Fresh#4- The most comfortable bed. The W Hotels guarentee your sleep.. Hotel QT could do the same.#5- Plasma TV#6-Space. There is thoughtful room planning. We stored our luggage in the cubbys underneath the bed and we had a balcony bench. There was also a table where we can put our laptop. Our window opened even! (room 1301)(try the park central- nothing fits under the bed- they block it... so our luggage is just out)#7-Great In Room Safe. I know, every hotel has one, but can it fit your laptop? Nope. This does.#8-Refrigerator. Its small but so convienient. (The Parker Meridian charges you for a fridge...$50. They have a fridge in the room you don't have to rent, but you cant move anything in it or else they charge you for the item you moved)#9-Tiffany in reception. The staff was so accomidating (except for one front desk girl who shouldnt answer the phones, let her make card keys) The Breakfast Guy, The Maintenance Guys, Tiffany... great staff.#10-Did I mention the price? It was so inexpensive, that we could have a longer trip, and enjoy ourselves without worrying about an expensive room. We already booked for another trip.

<Content>Coolness Personified On first entry to the Hotel QT I had to do a double take to work out where the check in was as it looked like a newsagency counter, festooned with funky postcards, newspapers and packets of gum set in glass on the counter. The Hilton this hotel is not.As the other reviewers have said, this hotel definitely maximises the space of the rooms. My room had 2 single beds wedged into the sleeping part of the room with the main bathroom/kitchen in the other half. The beds are comfy, however I would warn people who are looking to share a room, make sure it is someone you know intimately.Free Wifi, a small LCD tv, funky glass bar fridge, iron, all the requirements for a seasoned traveller. And for a cost of USD145 and just off Times Square, almost impossible to go wrong.The only negatives, check in was strictly after 3pm due to their being full. Probably a common problem with their prices. This is offset by the midday checkout. Then lighting in the shower (a walk in wet room style) is almost non existant and the same in the toilet. Also no door on either, so once again, only share a room if you know the person *very* well.In summary - somewhere I would definitely, definitely say again.

<Content>Get as high up as you can! This is a really great hotel. It's clean, ideally located and great breakfast. We stayed on the third floor (rm 305) which is located directly above the disco. The disco operates until 2am each night at least and the noise is absolutely DEAFENING. We received a letter on our third night informing us that we were unable to use the bar and the pool facilities as a private party was being held there that night. We were assured it would finish by 1am. At a quarter to three we were begging the hotel to do something about the noise. They did nothing but apologise and claim they were powerless to stop it.! The party was being held by a popstar and they were too weak to take care of their paying guests. If you stay there, insist on a room high up away from the noise and you should have a great time, otherwise you might find yourself having to sleep through the day instead of exploring that great city. New York might not sleep, but people DO and the hotel would do well to show their guests a bit more respect. If you pay for a bed for the night, the very least you can expect is to be able to sleep in it.

<Content>Location, Location, Location I just spent 4 nights at the QT with my 18 year-old daughter, and while there are many good things about the QT, the location is exceptional. Just a short walk down 45th Street and you are right in the middle of Times Square, a short walk the other way and you are on 5th Avenue. Getting to the subway station was a 3 minute walk where you can catch the R train to get uptown and downtown in minutes. Our room was on the third floor right on 45th Street and the street noise was a little difficult to get used to but by the second night we slept fine. The breakfast is excellent - an incredible value! The breakfast was moved to the lounge when we were there because they were doing maintenance on the regular floor, and the pool was closed the entire time we were there-also for maintenance. The beds were as comfortable as every reviewer has pointed out and we did have a towel bar next to the shower unlike others. Our room was a nice size but I missed not having at least a chair in the room or a traditional lobby with places to relax and unwind after a long day. The place isn't fancy and amenties are few but for the price I would stay there again in a minute.

<Content>Great place for the money Hotel QT is a great place for the money. It is clean, situated in a great part of Manhattan, and the staff are very friendly. We especially enjoyed the little bar where we were treated very kindly and thoroughly enjoyed our bartender's suggestions. The rooms are small, but are very sleek and clean. The only complaint I have is that the bathroom tiles are showing signs of wear and could use a Bleach Pen treatment.

<Content>QT - good value A friend and I flew in for just one day to go to the Cream concert. We were looking for some reasonable rooms to keep ourselves on a New York for $1,000 a day budget. This hotel was selected primarily because of positive reviews and a realistic price. No disappointments. Clean rooms, larger than expected, great beds, casual but competent service, great location. We even received a call from the hotel warning that the pool would be closed for maintenance. Nothing worse than showing up at a hotel with closed ammenities or plastic sheeting and scaffolding.Maybe not the place to impress a date, but absolutely no reservations in offering a recommendation.

<Content>Great! I usually don't write reviews but after coming here, I just HAD to. It was perfect. Clean and had a cool chic feel to it. The hallways to the rooms seemed a little shady but never had a problem. Never took advantage of the pool but wish we had. Location is great. Half a block from Times Square and just a couple blocks from 5th ave and all other shopping. There's always things happening around the corner (we were there for the grand opening of the Hard Rock Cafe at Times Square and Broadway on Broadway). This was the best anniversary ever!

<Content>Great hip "budget" hotel Budget pricing in New York is different than other cities.The QT represents good value in this city - my room was spacious - the shower great - bed magnificent - and beigels at breakfast - great!Staff were very helpful.If you really want to pay $300 more per night for a few extra shelves in the room - go ahead - but the QT is fine for me.

<Content>Best anniversary ever!! My 40-something husband and I spent 3 nights at the Hotel QT for our 20th anniversary on Oct. 6-9. We had the time of our lives! I could not believe that this hotel was truly as close to Times Square as it is, and yet feels tucked away. Checking in was a breeze. Our room was on the 5th floor facing 45th street. There was some street noise, but not any louder than the 11th floor of the Hilton New York ($300+/night!) The rooms are definitely different, but in such a cool way. There was no furniture, but the padded platform built around the bed was more than adequate to sit on to tie your shoes. I slept by the window, so I had to climb onto the platform then crawl across the bed to get to my side. This was not a big deal to us - but I did say more than once that my 80-something parents would have hated this room. As others have noted, there was nowhere to hang a towel. If this will bug you then go to the dollar store and buy a suction cup hook to stick in your suitcase. There is also no clock or radio. The staff was very friendly and courteous, the bed was divine, and the whole atmosphere was so pleasant and positive. Another plus is that we figured we saved at least $30 on breakfast every day we were there, as we each had 2 espressos, bagels, an egg, the most incredible granola and a huge glass of FRESH juice every morning. The pool was 93 fabulous degrees, the sauna was wonderful....I am still on a high from that trip, can you tell?? Of course, U2 at Madison Square Garden and Spamalot might have contributed to that!

<Content>QT... so cool!! we recently stayed at the hotel qt in sept '05 and were delighted with the place!it's true that it's not for everyone ...but for us, a young married couple, it fit the bill. we lilked the uniqueness of it with funky decor and cool style. the bar/nightclub was a great lounging spot after a full day of sightseeing. the pool was refreshing especially after those hotter days we spent trekking around the great city. the rooms have all you need as far as we were concerned and the bed was indeed comfortable. i could see the bed being very awkward for elderly or less mobile people to get in and out of. when we arrived, the fellow at the door was very inviting and he was also doing double duty being a doorman for an exclusive party which we found out later was a party for gwen stefani! how cool! it's very close to times square and right in the heart of it all which was very convenient to see shows and search out great eats. the room was very quiet, we requested one on a higher floor in case there was street noise. from some of the other reviews we were unsure if there would be toiletries but there were plenty and refills too. the minifridge was a great plus to keep bevvies cool. i used the work out room a few days (there were tv's on the machines but you need to bring ear phones to plug in to hear), it was never busy either. the breakfast had good choice with coffee/tea/capuccino/espresso/muffins/croissants/bagels(toasted if you like)/hard boiled eggs/yogurt/cereal/granola/juice/and assorted fruits. the hotel is considered low service but all we wanted and needed was available. the boutique had lots of good stuff to buy but the items were pricey, of course. having the extras is what brings the price of the accomodation up in new york, and the qt is an affordable place especially considering the great location for tourists. all in all , a perfect choice for us!! NOTE: if you like mexican food be sure to head over to Viva Pancho on one street over!

<Content>Would stay again! My husband and I are in our 50's and stayed at Hotel QT for 2 nights. It was fine for us--but if you are one to act your age, you may find this hotel a tad too hip for you.I wondered how many people were able to see me as I showered, not that it mattered to me.This hotel is not for people that plan to do much other than sleep in their room, but it is great to be within close walking distance of the theatres we went to. If you are all about a good nights sleep and good location and good value--then Hotel QT is perfect. We would stay again.

<Content>Fabulous My boyfriend and I recently spent 3 nights at the QT for my birthday weekend. Having read the reviews I was expecting a very small dingy bedroom but was incredibly surprised when I opened the door to a large, bright, clean, modern room. Regarding the towels we had a rail in our room so this may be a new installment. We were on the 8th floor. There was space to hang our clothes and room under the bed to hide our suitcases. All in all extremely impressed and happy. I would recommend this to anyone. The comments about it being full of young, trendy model types should not put you off. When we went there was a range of people from late teens to early 60s. Something for everyone. One last thing - the breakfast! This was fantastic. You can eat as much or as little as you want. Fresh coffee, juice, bagels, muffins - wonderful. The hotel staff will also organise a car back to JFK at a fixed price which saves the hassle of a cab.

<Content>Excellent!!!! Have just returned from a 6 night stay at the Hotel QT after getting married in New York. I had read all the reviews before going out and all seemed to be quite positive, but you are always wary until you get there incase it turns out completely different. Hotel QT surpassed all my expectations and I will definitely be going back there when we go back to New York. Location wise for starters cant be beaten. 50 mtrs from the heart of Time Square, right next door to two excellent irish bars, and close by to metro stations, bus stop,etc.The Hotel itself is quite inconspicous from the outside, and probably just looks like a magazine shop to someone looking inside the front window, however you only get too appreciate how cool it is once you actually go inside. The check in desk was also where they sell magazines, drinks etc, however on arrival at about 1:30pm, we were given rooms straight away and found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful, something that we experienced all throughout our stay. From the front door staff to the porters, even the maids cleaning the rooms, everyone always took time to say hello or good morning.On arriving in our room, we were given one in the front of the hotel on the corner of the building(1210). All the rooms appear to be different sizes and ours was on the small size, however, perfectly adequate for the 6 day stay (including getting dressed on our wedding day). My parents room was (1008) and this was a lot bigger in size, however there wasnt as much natural light in their room and the toilet/shower faced right onto the room.We had a separate bathroom with a window. The only thing suggestion I would make is that they frost up the whole window as the top half isnt frosted and I had to wait til the windows steamed up before I had a shower, just incase someone had binoculars in one of the taller buildings opposite!!In addition to a smart flatscreen TV on the wall, the room also had a DVD player which we used to play CD's through the TV. All rooms have fridge, which although arent that big, they are enough to hold a couple of bottles or 6 or 7 cans of juice/lager,etc which you can buy at the front desk. There is also a cupboard with hangars, and so there was plenty of room to store clothes, despite there being no drawers. There is also a small safe in the room, which is free of charge and a phone.The beds deserve a separate mention, as they are without doubt THE most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. So much so that I even took a note of the make of mattress, as I want to buy one for myself. The pillows and quilt are a mix of down and feathers and you practically melt into the bed every night. They probably arent the easiest beds to get into if you arent too mobile, as they have a padded shelf round the side, but this isnt even a gripe, just something worth noting. I cant remember having a better nights sleep in my life.The hotel also has a steam room, sauna, small fitness room (two bikes, a rowing machine - both with TV's on the front and some free weights- barbells). The steam room was particularly good, and really helped relax you after a hard days shopping/walking. The pool is down a few steps, and on weekends a DJ plays in the pool area and there are comfy pillows on the steps looking onto the pool. The pool is very small, not for swimming, although you could get a few strokes of breast stroke in. Its also pretty cold. There is a window at one side of the pool so you can get drinks put on your tab, although as some people have commented, the prices are a bit more that the nearby irish bars, but hey, if you are only getting one or two!!The hotel also serves a continental breakfast every morning which is brilliant and you can eat as much as you like. If the breakfast rooms too crowded then you can just take it back up to your room.The staff we encountered, as mentioned before, were very helpful. On our wedding day they organised private hire limos, and couldnt have been more helpful. They do use google searches if you need to find somewhere, but they try there best to help you as much as possible.All in all we had a fantastic time and will definitely use this hotel again and again. My only concern is that it will get more popular and the prices will go up and it will be more difficult to get a room. However with this being New York, thats very unlikely. We'll definitely be back.

<Content>Hotel QT First let me preface this by saying that i am extremely, extremely neat! New York hotels usually make me quite ill due to their age, cleanliness (or lack there of), but i was pleasantly surprised with hotel QT.Pros* Very reasonably priced* Beds are extremely comfortable (down pillows, comforter etc)* Nice Towels* Location - half a block from Time Square* friendly and accomodating staff* Very Clean* Nice young crowd* Nice atmosphere- pool/bar was funCons * rooms were small ( what else is new in NYC?) * Bathroom tiles could have used some attention (not gross or anything, but for such a nice looking hotel, the tiles looked old)* Pricey drinks ( if you plan on drinking in their bar, be prepared to shell out 10 dollars for a rum and coke)All in all, a great experience. I plan to stay here everytime i come to NYC

<Content>Odd blend of chic and sparse When I first entered the hotel I couldn't find the front desk, because there isn't one. The registration area doubles as a sundry store. This is an indication of the unconventional nature of this hotel. I came to NYC on business and this hotel was reasonably priced for this time of year. When I entered my room on the 11th floor, I couldn't decide whether the sparseness was chic or prison-like. Ultimately, I decided that it had all the basic comforts and then some. My room was very large and a full third of it was my bed on a platform with a flat screen television on the wall at the foot of it. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in. The in-room fridge is a plus. The towels are plush (although all the other reviews are right about the lack of hanging pegs) and the unusual bathroom set up is a bit uncomfortable at first. In the end, I had one of my best stays ever in NYC. Another oddity -- the in-room DVD player was located under a bench next to the bed. I only noticed it after my third day!

<Content>Perfect hotel for romantic break My partner and I booked a 4 night stay for a romantic break. We had a fabulous time. The hotel was great. Amazing location, wonderful room (#411), cool bar and pool in the lobby, lesbian/gay friendly. No, the room wasn't massive but there was more than enough space and I have no complaints about that. It was clean , the bed was so comfy, the decor was contemporary and attractive,overall it was fab. Having looked at one of the floor plans I would advise that you don't get a corner room - they do look tiny compared to ours. The pool isn't the kind of place you are going to do laps in but it's great for lounging around in. The continental breakfast in the morning was great and the staff were friendly. I agree that when you asked for advice the staff had to 'google' but they were really nice. My only complaint was that they did not pass on a phone message for me from my partner to say that her plane had been delayed, fortunately this did not cause any problems. We had a wonderful time and I will return on my next trip to NYC.

<Content>Boutique hotel in NYC I have just returned from staying at Hotel QT on West 45th Street. The hotel itself is small and describes itself as no frills hence if you are looking for a mini bar in your room, look elsewhere. The rooms are very stylishly decorated. Beds are on platforms and furnishings are functional and minimalist. Like most hotels in NYC, the rooms are small but the designer has made great use of the space.A continental style breakfast is free and I found it to be more than adequate. There is a really cool swimming pool that opens up onto the bar so you can have a cosmopolitan in the evenings while swimming up to the bar!The one complaint I would have is over the reservations/reception desk. Staff are not very competent in this area and you get the feeling that they need training in room categories and how to check people in!Overall, great location, nice rooms and very reasonably priced. I would stay there again....

<Content>Excellent location and pool bar Hotel qt was in such a convieniant spot.It literally took 3 mins to walk to times square.The rooms were clean and well equipped (even having a mini fridge in your room)and the hotel staff were very helpful.The pool was so warm it was like a giant bath tub.You can swim and go to the bar at the same time!They do excellent manhattens!There was also a sauna and a wet room.The hotel was extremely cheap considering its facilities and location.I'd recommend it to anyone.

<Content>great value for midtown Just checked out of the QT and as everyone notes its a great value for midtown. I booked through the Avant Guide website and paid $135. Staff says that all the rooms are different, so its hard to tell if mine was representative - but the king bed was on a platform that seemed a little high (18 inches) with the mattress on top - so you couldn't walk around the bed... you kind of had to climb up and crawl over to the far side if you we 2 in the room... not a real problem for most... but if you have access concerns, something to consider - I tried walking on top of the 'wrap-around' platform but banged my head on a beam, so I went back to 'the crawl'... seems like a trimput of design over function... don't know if the designer has actually ever slept in one of the rooms....Other than that, its minimal but comfortable - great mattress, linens, pillows and the flat-panel TV... so if you're out enjoying NYC and just use your room to sleep - its great.... There is a 'dog bone' shaped light fixture over the bed that you have to squeeze your hand up inside to turn on or off - but the main purpose of this seems to be as a passive sound reflector which is pretty cool...No space for a computer except on the platform edge... There were several people being moved to larger rooms.... it looks like some of the rooms in the corners may be smaller.... one was a business type that needed to work, another a honeymoon couple - but the staff was very nice and accommodated them with no problems.... But plan in advance, once the hotel is finished it may be hard to upgrade if you find the room small.My room was in the center 803 and long with the entrance in the closet/bathroom area which was very well designed except for the lights which were too bright if you turned them on while someone was sleeping... Towels and 'Kiss my Face' amenities were nice - and the shower/toilet sliding door is unique. They need to add a hook by the shower to hang your towel while you're in the shower... now, you have to put it on the floor outside the shower... or walk across the bathroom to retrieve it from the shelf while you're dripping...Again - high design by a designer who ovbiously never slept/showered in their own rooms... The staff said that they were getting lots of complaint about this - so they were thinking about adding a hook somewhere...Staff is all very helpful but still learning... The breakfast in the morning is very, very nice for a NYC hotel - coffee, juice, cereal, muffins, fruit, danish, croissants at no extra charge...If you want an upscale business hotel don't stay here... but if you want upscale budget with style... give it a try...

<Content>Great location and bed The QT was a wonderful location. The room was very clean. The bed was WONDERFUL. The front desk was very professional and helpful. Bellboys were well dressed and extremely friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was very nice! The only poor I would give would be for the bathroom...very small, no place to put your tolietries in the shower. It was welllll worth the money we paid (got a great rate on Hotels).

<Content>what a great hotel - can't wait for the next trip! My boyfriend and I stayed for 5 nights in the qt at the end of august and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again! From the customer sevice right through the the location this hotel is perfect. If you love a contemporary feel with gadgets and technology galore you will love this hotel.Here are some of the highlights:- Large (for ny standards) open plan, room-not so good if room sharers are a little shy as there is not much privacy.- plasma tv, dvd player, fridge and safe in room.-lovely continental breakfast included FREE OF CHARGE!!!- polite and helpful staff who were willing to store luggage for us before and after checkin/out.- massive bed!!!! so comfy we could have slept all day and night!- not much outside noise and we were on the 4th floor!!!-spitting distance from times square!it was great, great, great - you must all go there now!

<Content>What Happen to quality control I arrived at the Qt on Saturday Sept 3, 2005 at about 1:00 AM notice the TV did not work, the A/C did not work. Reported to receptionist the next morning at 7:00 AM. Did not get the TV fitted until the 5th, but still no A/C. Every day at 7:00 AM I ask the receptionist about the repair but I got the answer (the engineer will fit it today). I left the hotel on Sept 7. and still the A/C was not working. As I approached the receptionist they show me a list of the time they try to contact me and was not successful. If they were really trying to get me they coud of left a note for the receptionist in the morning. I am a very calm person, I dont argue. But Ill wont come back to this hotel. I visit New York alot, but they lost a good customer. I bet if you go today the A/C is still not working. What happen to quality control? Is it the policy to hand over a defective room, and try to get away with it? My room number was 1307.

<Content>Perfect Small Boutique Hotel Near Times Square Awesome location, comforatable, contemporary, simple accomodations. If you like small boutique hotels for their cleanliness and chicness, this is the place for you....also Great price! The staff was friendly...all of them and very helpful from booking to departure. We were a party of six...2 parents, 2 16 year olds and 2 10 yr. olds...they loved it, though no other kids were around (there is a nice contemporary pool/sauna/steam room area) . The included continental breakfast was all you needed as well. Only down side of the whole experience was that there is no door between the bedroom and the sink area of the bathroom. Beds are ULTRA comfy (down comforters, duvets and king size down pillows)!ZZZZZZZZZ

<Content>Wanted to love it, but found it lacking customer service... I just returned from a business trip to NY, and a 3 night stay at the Hotel QT. The reviews of this hotel and the website had me intrigued and for the most part my overall impression is on the favorable side, with the exception of customer service - one place you shouldn't skimp even when offering budget accomodations. It began upon my arrival: The front desk was woefully understaffed, and my check in took 40 minutes, as reception also serves as a kind of newstand and snack shop for guests. Guests can purchase items there to fill the minibar, and with only one person there to help everybody I was in for a wait even though I was the only guest checking in at the time. The second major inconvenience came when they put a hold on my credit card for double 3 nights, plus $50 per day in incedentals. I wasn't aware of this until the next day and a phone call to the manager fixed the problem yet another day later, but the attitude I encountered when asking for $1200 to be take off my card until I checked out was frosty. I've never encountered anything like this in the past and I travel frequently. One other funky thing you may encounter is with the rooms themselves, which has been mentioned before, but you don't really believe it until you see it. I was travelling alone, so it wasn't an issue, but my room had two twin beds and an open shower which faced the rest of the room directly. If you're travelling with someone you don't know intimately, *ahem, it could be very akward. However, the hotel is decorated interestingly, in a great location, the bedding is VERY comfortable (really one of the best things about my stay was the comfy bed) and the complementary continental breakfast is quite nice. The bar was crowded and fun. I would stay there again only if budget was a real issue, because one can find much better service and a similar ambiance at the W.

<Content>Good Deal, Great Location This hotel was a great find in a city where you don't get much bang for your hotel dollar. First, the hotel is new. That means it's clean, the air conditioners are quiet, the rooms don't smell like mold, mildew, or the city, and the beds are comfy and the linens are really clean. Second, the hotel has great amenities. A free continental breakfast; a small pool with a swim up bar, a 24 hour fitness studio with great modern equiptment and steam room; and the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. Third, the location can't be beat for the price. The hotel may be too modern for some travelers. The bar itself is very stylish. The customers tend to be younger and hipper than say, the Marriott or the Hilton. I would stay here again any time.

<Content>Loved the Comfy Pillows and Sheets This is a great find. Room was decorated in a chic, modern style. Large king size bed with flat screen TV on the wall at the foot of the bed. Bed was on a platform, giving it a sleek look. No floral bedspreads here - all linens are ecru and crisp. The most comfortable hotel pillows we have ever had. Huge towels to wrap yourself in after the shower (shower head was one of those large circular rainshower types)The indoor pool in the lobby got quite a bit of use. By families during the day, and young adults in the evening.Breakfast was a treat- bagels, croissants, OJ, coffee, cereal, yogurt  fruit. The front desk staff could not have been nicer or more accomodating. Check-in was quick and efficient.And the location! Oh, the location! Just around the corner from Times Square. Only downsides: can't close off the bathroom area, no towel hooks in the room (my SIL's room had towel hooks, but mine didn't), dimly lit hallwaysDefinitely at the top of my list for a repeat visit.

<Content>QT quite the hotel We stayed in the QT hotel for three nights this august. It was very funky, clean and understated with friendly hotel staff and good sized bedrooms. We asked for the 10th floor following previous tripadvisor reviews. Good idea as it can be quite noisy outside. What a location, right in the heart of theatreland which suited us so well. It's a very modern hotel with a 24 hour gym, steam room and pool - in the BAR!! That may be asking for trouble - lucky there were no drunken frat parties around!! The rooms, with open access bathrooms, are good for couples or very friendly friends!! Breakfast is included which is a first for american hotels, in my experience.Friends of ours visited from princeton and they we so impressed that they are going to stay next time they are in the city.. Great value, great rooms, great location - great hotel

<Content>Details are great, could use some help on the big picture I am a New Yorker, but stayed here with my mom during her visit. We loved the location and the staff. The breakfast room and selection made me feel like I was in a European or S. American hotel and is also a great way to break the ice with other guests (you how everyone stares up or down in an elevator). The coffee is very good and I'm a maniac about coffee. Yummy bedding. Kiss My Face toiletries.However, too many creature comforts and neccessities are overlooked. Why the hell aren't there any towel hooks? There's wall space everywhere. One has to drop those lovely bathsheets and handtowels on the floor or draped over your stuff on the one bathroom counter. Ditto to the bathroom door and toilet lack of privacy problems mentioned in other reviews here.And drawers? Again, there's plenty of space. Next to the bed is a platform table. Drawers would work perfectly beneath that. Or the round table for keys, etc, could be a small bureau. Finally, the lighting is so dim that it reminded me of Italian pensions in the 1980s when you needed to travel with lightbulbs. Fishtank pools and cute names are fine, but I wish they'd deal with the fundamentals of hotelry first.

<Content>Great catch! Just came back from this hotel. We stayed from Sunday-Monday (July 24-25) I think the best deal ($150/nt) for this area. Hotel QT is one block east of Times Square without the Times Sqaure price. I had requested a room that was higher up so we stayed in room 2012 on the 12th floor. bed was super comfortable, great tv (flat screen) and most of all, clean. We had a view of a side street but that was ok since it was quieter. Only con was that we missed it the first time we drove by. The hotel sign is very small and hidden by a larger sign for O'Connelly's which is a bar/restaurant right next door. It is on the small side so if you are looking for a huge Westin type room, this is not it. It is more of a flat apartment type but not like a hostel either or a bed and breakfast of which I am not a fan.We did not use the pool and did not eat breakfast there. The pool looked awesome but we forgot our swimsuits. There are a ton of cheap 24HR breakfast places so we opted to go out.I would def recommend this hotel. If anyone has any more questions, please feel free to email me at neeke10@aol.com or leave a message on here.I would defintely recommend this

<Content>loved hotel QT I stayed at the Hotel QT for 4 nights with my 15 year old daughter. Asked for a king bed and closed bathroom which we got (room 1010). The bed was very comfortable. The refrigerator in the room was great for keeping soft drinks and leftovers from meals. The breakfast was very nice. The steam room was great. Loved the bathsheets and large shower. Although our room faced 45th street it was noisey but I always travel with earplugs. We brought our own alarm clock but a wake up call arrived on time. We had a large closet with hangers and an iron, ironing board and hairdryer in it. We had a small table and chair in our room.also. Also had a towel rack in our bathroom which some reviewers mentioned they didn't have. The staff was great. The location was great and we wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Hotel QT again. It may not be a place for everyone( I am 51 and enjoyed it) as it is not your typical  hotel room, platform bed, etc. but is is brand new, clean, reasonable(I paid $165 a night on Quickbook) with many amenities I have not had in any of the other places I have stayed in NYC (pool, steam, sauna, bathsheets, breakfast, etc).

<Content>fantastic getaway If you like the jetset high fashion lifestyle but have an average joe income, you'll love this hotel. From the bustle of tourists in Time Square, you enter into a lobby of calm and privacy.The staff were friendly and professional. Once I saw the modern hip room, I knew I had to stay another night. The staff accomodated the rate I booked at which was less than what the current rack rate. I loved the Kiss My Face products and the mini fridge that you could stock from the pantry behind the reception area. And the reception area was a sweet tooth and magazine reader's fantasy. QT is an ideal spot if you are just out to have fun in the city!

I had one bad experience with the guy who said he was hotel security it seemed as if he went out of his way to ask dum questions.

<Content>Andre Balazs does it once again! We are frequent guests to Mr. Balazs' west coast properties and were thrilled to learn of this new property in NYC. Although it took some searching to find info about it and even more to locate some photos (the hotel only opened in Feb and not everything was set for photos yet) we were very excited and sent a couple of emails to the hotel to gain information. They were responded to very promptly and answered all of our questions, so, without any idea of what the hotel actually looked like, we booked our stay for our June trip to the city. We constantly were looking for reviews and pictures and when we found them they were all pretty good so we were really ready for our stay. When we arrived it was still a few hours until check-in, but the bellman held our bags right away and was very helpful. After walking through what felt like all of Manhattan, we went back to check-in. The main thing that my boyfriend was concerned about (we had also mentioned it in our reservation requests) was to get a high floor to avoid the street noise. Not only was the high floor given to us, but it was already assigned and held for us! The clerk at the front desk was very nice and got us checked-in very quickly. The room was a little small, but it was very comfortable and unless you are planning on spending your entire trip in there, it really works out perfectly. There are more than 30 channels offered on the flat screen tv in each room, in addition to PPV movies. The housekeeping was done everyday and it was left immaculate. I even loaded all of my valuables in the safe and forgot to close it one morning and returned to find everything EXACTLY as I left it! The hotel staff was very willing to help, though they did not necessarily know what we were asking about all of the time. The ice machines were not working on any of the floors, which was one of the very few inconveniences, but the staff brought it up everytime it was requested. The continental breakfast was every morning, and although the options are somewhat basic, the gentleman that tends to you is very friendly and definitely ensures that your day is started off right! The bed was very comfortable and the down comforter was heavenly. The bathrooms are very unique. The toilet and the shower are the same room. I know it sounds odd, but it worked out okay. Although the space is small, the designer really used what they had very efficiently. Next time we are in New York City, the QT is definitely where we will be staying. The service and comfort, not to mention convenient locale, are worth every penny.

<Content>Hotel QT worked for us My husband and I visited NYC at the end of June with our 15 year old daughter. We stayed in a unique room that had a king size bed and a twin bunk above. It was absolutely perfect for our needs! Our daughter had her own space and we had ours. Like the other reviews here, I can testify that the beds were super comfortable and ideal for crashing after a long day. We were also pleased that the air conditioner worked very well, because it was hot and humid while we were there and it was nice to come back to a room where we could cool off quickly.The other wonderful thing about the hotel was the lovely continental breakfast. Beautiful pastries, muffins and croissants, fresh squeezed orange juice, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, cereal, coffee.......it was much more than I expected and a real perk to have it included in the price of the room. The staff was also very friendly and helpful.The downside of the hotel has been mentioned here often........the functionality of the rooms. We had requested a room with a door on the bathroom, but we did not get that. The bathroom opened to the bedroom, but there was a sliding door to the shower and toilet.......but the door covered only one at a time. Because we were concerned with privacy, since we had our daughter with us, we needed our towels near the shower so we could cover up when we were finished, but there was no hook for towels. We had to lay them on the floor next to the shower door. And then we had to get dressed in the toilet area if we wanted privacy.......a bit awkward. The other function issue was that there was not a dresser in the room. We put our clothes on the ledge that ran around the bed and along the wall. It served as a seat and a place to store things. It was fine, but the room had a cluttered, messy feel, because of all our stuff. There was a shelf in the closet, but it was too high for me to reach.We did not take advantage of the indoor pool....it did not seem like an appropriate place for us.........more of a bar scene.These were minor inconveniences for us though. We got a great price on the room.........although I have noticed that prices are creeping up. And the location is ideal. The room itself was comfortable, clean, cool with a great bed. I'd stay again.

<Content>Great hotel! My husband and I just recently spent two nights at the QT and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the location couldn't have been more convenient, the mattresses were perhaps the most comfortable I have ever slept on, the continental breakfast was great, and the price couldn't have been beaten. The room does lack hooks, but this was only a minor inconvenience. We ordered wake-up calls for both days we were there and not only were the calls exactly on-time, but the front desk placed follow-up calls on both days to confirm that automatic system was working properly. The QT is truly a great hotel.

<Content>A Really Cool Place Near Times Square I stayed here with my best friend from June 9 through 13. We both loved it! Front desk personnel were very accomodating. Check in was very fast and efficient as was checkout. Our room was clean. The beds are a little high off the floor but once you step up and into them you want to stay there because they are so comfortable. We had breakfast each morning. Breakfast there consisted of croissants, muffins, cold cereals, fresh fruit, coffee, tea and fresh squeezed orange juice, it was great. The hotel is centrally located near Times Square. Our room faced the street. Unlike what some people have reported our room had plenty of space in it for us and our luggage. There are some minor quirky designer touches that take some getting used to like the door numbers to the rooms. They are not easily seen from the main hallway because they are at an angle down smaller hallways off the main hallway. In the evenings the bar and pool area were very busy. Music was a little loud at times when you entered the lobby. But this hotel is geared for the younger crowd. I will definitely be staying at the Hotel Qt again. With a rate of $190.00 plus tax per night for a room in NYC you cannot beat it.

<Content>QT was great! But... In light of the rates, the QT is a rare find in Manhattan. For under 200 dollars a night you get a clean, cool hotel with an excellent location just seconds from Times Square. The room me and my girlfriend had was quite big - only two things though: telephone didn't work and there were no place to hang towels. The lobby pool and bar was great after a day of shopping. More of a spa feeling than an acutal pool - but who likes swimming anyway? The sauna and steam room looked beautiful, but I never tried them so who knows... During the weekend, the bar scene was really good - but a bit pricey considering you get served cocktails in plastic glasses. The front desk looked cool and was pretty well stacked - BUT, and this is my main problem with this hotel - the staff (except for one guy) knew less about New York than I do - and this was my first visit to the city! 1) The didn't know how far it was to Shea Stadium and they were not able to find out (which resulted in a 45 dollar cab ride, where a 2 dollar subway ride would have been easier and just as quick) 2) The wouldn't help me reserve a dinner table at a restaurant 3) When asked for a place to get a really good breakfast, they recommended Howard Johnson on Times Square, which is one of the most disgusting places I have ever been to. 4) When I asked for a nice sky bar, they directed me to Dream Hotel where the bar was on the 12th floor with NO sky bar feeling what so ever 5) They googled everything, since they acutally didn't know s**t about the city... So, all in all - a great place for a party/shopping vacation but be sure to get your inside information on whats going on in the city from other sources than the hotel...

<Content>Fun hotel with a couple of issues... I stayed here with my wife this past weekend and we had a great time (with some issues noted below). The little pool was a fun addition to the scene of the hotel. The midtown location was perfect for our weekend (museums uptown, shops and eating downtown). The staff was very friendly and helpful when asked. We stayed in two different rooms-- a room with two beds (one as a loft) and a room with a queen sized bed. The loft bed room was cool but I couldn't imagine sharing it with friends since the shower didn't have a curtain or a door. This room was on the back on the hotel and was dark but quiet. The queen bed room did have a door that slid in front of the shower or the toilet. This room was on the front and got more light but was noisy all night with construction vehicles. As mentioned, the showers need a hook for the towels (you have to put them on the floor to get them close to the shower). Some more of the negatives鈥?Both of our rooms had several burnt out light bulbs and the upholstery on the seating/bed frames was already looking ratty. I hope they work to keep the place up since it is pretty new. There were two tacks sticking out of the fabric next to our bed and my wife stepped on one (we told the front desk and they apologized but we didn鈥檛 even get a free vitamin water). There is no alarm clock provided in the room (and we overheard that the wake up call system didn鈥檛 work for several guests). There is no good working area if you stay there for business. Some of the positives: location, a good simple breakfast with great OJ and coffee, cool scene at night by the pool, comfy beds and pillows, HDTV/DVD in room, kiss my face products in the bathroom (although they were stingy with replacing these), good magazines in the room, 鈥渇ill your own鈥?mini-bar (an empty fridge with stuff for sale downstairs), and, as I said, a friendly staff.

<Content>Great place to stay for the price. If you want to stay in Manhattan for under 200$, you can stay in a run down dive, or stay at Hotel QT. The rooms are not luxurious or spacious, but they are nice! Bed was very comfortable. I would not recommend for a family, but for singles or couples who want an up-scale but no frills room, this is it.Staff was great.

<Content>needs less funk  Trendy. Great location. Great price. The beds have wonderful thick cotton sheets and blankets. Perhaps it is better now. For me -- the QT is the product of someone young, hip, imaginative with lots of money and no common sense. We stayed for three claustrophobic nights in a double room. The funky look for the room meant shower hooks but no shower curtains. Hint: a double room shared by close friends still needs a shower curtain. Workmen told me that the hotel opened early and there were a lot of things, like shower curtains, that weren't ready yet. The sauna, elevator, telephone system were all under repair. Construction was going on all the time. The hallways are too dark. Hint: guests need light to see the key. The lights inside the room are weak, bad wattage, in awkward places, and not meant for reading. The funky look meant no table nor chairs in our room. No real closet -- just hooks on the wall. Hint: hooks are not good for expensive clothes. The funky pool is clear and above the bar. However, it is about three ft deep and once again mainly for show. The concession stand check-in is cute but the area does not provide enough space for your luggage or for business transactions at the counter. Hint: move the candy; it's funky but not really a selling point.

<Content>Quality hotel Just came back from a Memorial Day weekendin NYC. QT is located between 6th avenue and Broadway, very conveniet to many theatres. The closest subway is on 42nd and Broadway, but it takes time to get there because of the constant crowd on Times Square.Would agree with previous reviews about its location and comfort bed. Linens and towels are new and clean, rooms small like in any NY hotel. The only drawback was the noise from the street that the hotel is on. I was on the third floor, and late at night and very early in the morning delivery trucks would wake me up. If you are a light sleeper ask for a high floor, the hotel has 16 floors. In general, it always nicer to stay in a new establishment even if it's not too fancy. One other thing that kind of annoyed me was the personnel at the cafe on the second floor that would start cleaning your table while you are still eating and vacuum cleaning while the guests are stiil there. Made me feel like finish the breakfast ASAP and leave.

<Content>Great Value, Room not for everyone Stayed 3 nights over Memorial Day Holiday. Great location, took Airport Shuttle Bus to Port Authority Terminal (42nd/8th) short walk to the hotel, also close to most subway lines. Rooms are adequate size. Bathrooms great with large counter, shower and toilet rooms, includes refrig. Small open closet had enought room for hanging, floor space used for shoes, purchases, etc. Platform bed has walls on 3 sides, this makes it extremely difficult for climbing in and out. Bed sits approx 36 from the floor, padded railing aids in access. Complimentary Cont. Breakfast was good, cold cereal, pastries, whole fruit, coffee, tea, juice, served on 2nd floor just above pool. Housekeeping did not replace glasses or toiletries each day. No accessible ice machine, had to have it delivered. Front desk staff, while very pleasant, had little knowledge. Thank goodness for google on their computer. Everything was clean and bright. Consider it a good value, but not right for everyone.

<Content>Hotel QT - be very careful Review of the Hotel QTI recently stayed 4 nights at the Hotel QT off of Times Square in New York City. It is a newly opened hotel. The design of the rooms and common areas is non traditional but fun. The hotel staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. However鈥︹€?I made my reservation through an internet site which handles only booking the reservation and suggests that you contact the hotel directly for rates etc. I did, twice, before our arrival.I contacted the Hotel QT about a month before my arrival and told them that this was a long anticipated dad/daughters trip. This would be my 17 and 19 year old daughters first trip to New York City. Obviously we would need a room with at least 2 beds. I confirmed this a second time a couple of weeks before our arrival.When we arrived we were assigned a micro sized room with one small bed. I had previously agreed to pay a premium rate for what was described as a roomy 鈥渄eluxe鈥?room. No one would consider this a deluxe room and certainly no one would consider it roomy. Apparently, this was the only room available and so one daughter slept on the floor and the other on a shelf under the TV. While the room was far from deluxe and the room rate was outrageous.The following night we moved to an entirely acceptable room, however, rather than apologizing for their obvious error the night before, we were treated to a room rate which skyrocketed. To add injury to insult, a friend of mine staying in the same hotel was given a room which was just a bit smaller than the one we had been moved to, but charged substantially less per night. He made his reservations several days after I had made mine.Perhaps most disturbing aspect is the lack of responsiveness from hotel management. I explained my situation to several hotel staff and left a written description of events for the manager. I was absolutely guaranteed that the manager would get back to me. While I left both cell phone and work numbers, to date, I have received no response.In fairness, a night manager did listen sympathetically and reduced our rate by a nominal amount; but in light of the amount we were being gouged, the reduction was, by her own admission, insignificant.Mistakes are going to happen from time to time, but the fact is, that as a result of their booking error, my daughters had to sleep on the floor and a shelf per our the first night in our 鈥渄eluxe鈥?micro room. The Hotel QT compounded its original mistake by gouging us on the room rates and then avoided and/or ignored their promise that a manager would 鈥済et back to us鈥?End of the world, no鈥︹€? but very disappointing, yes.

<Content>Enjoyably different Just returned from a 4 night stay and must comment on the accuracy of most all previous reviews. Great value, wonderful beds, small rooms, friendly-helpful staff, ideal location with an avante-garde atmosphere.My main complaint, again follows along the same lines- ante-up for a simple towel hook in the bathroom, add a stool or chair to the room, and now that summer's coming, get those ice machines hooked up. If you can literaly live out of your suitcase and don't mind crawling across your bedmate to get in and out of the bed, then this is the place for you.I found that most of the complaints were in direct proportion to the age of the individual, the older, the more complaints.I enjoyed my stay and learned to live with the minor problems several of which could be easily corrected. We will be back.

<Content>Nice, oriented towards the young/hip set I booked the Hotel QT for myself and a friend (two separate rooms) for the night of April 21, because we were going to see a play at the Imperial Theater and it was one block over from the QT. While the facts in the previous reviews are objectively right, I wouldn't give it quite the subjective raves. First, the reception staff were deeply dumb (though easy on the eyes). They had no idea what theaters were right down the street from them and when I checked out, the girl checking me out completely forgot to give me a copy of my bill even though I was standing right in front of her (what she thought I was doing there since I was looking hopefully/expectantly at her the whole time, I'm not sure). The pool scene was very loud and splashy and crazy on a Thursday night; if you are coming in late and trying to get to your room, there's no avoiding it because the pool is right by the elevators. The free internet access didn't work and when I asked about it upon checkout was told, Oh, didn't the person who checked you in tell you you needed a password? Next time, check with us. Finally, the hotel isn't well-known yet, so the cabs are unwilling to stop for the poor bellhop. We had to wait more than 45 minutes for a cab (during which time the bellhop, pulled between three tasks at once, deserted us to go pull someone else's bags from storage) and even then only got one because a cabbie taking someone else from the hotel to a rental car agency a few blocks away took pity on us and intervened to have the occupants of his cab share the cab with us (they turned out to be wonderful people, so there's a good ending to that story...)We had rooms 1303 and 1305. 1305 is a bit bigger with a hallway, but I was informed that they were both the same kind of room: deluxe. The cost was $190 and $225 respectively (I was told that the $190 room was upgraded), so not the bargain it was a few months ago, perhaps.To sum up, Hotel QT is fine for a fun casual stay in NY on your own time, but if you need to get business done or require concierge-type services, skip it.

<Content>mmmm. interesting!!!! interesting place the QT. I agree with most of the previous reviews ie, friendly staff, very clean,very comfortable beds proximity to Times square etc. But, I wouldnt recommend for couples or for a shopping trip as the rooms are much too small for two or at least mine was, also couldnt find a place close by to have a real american breakfast which I like when in the u.s. If there is a place I'd love to hear about it as I would return on a business trip as the price is good. All in all a good experience.

<Content>Room for improvement, but brilliant overall! Based on raves in TripAdvisor I booked here for myself and 2 colleagues. Central location very near Times Square and Rock Center, W 45th was no more noisy at 3AM than most urban streets elsewhere. Loved the movie-house concession look to the front desk and the stock-your-own-minibar concept. Check in was okay, I got one of the tiny corner rooms which was mostly bed. Room was sleekly, minimally yet funkily furnished. The bed was simply amazing---a high platform by the windows, around its periphery was a bench/banquette which served as desk chair, bedside table and step to the bed in one, and the bed itself with high thread count linens and perfect pillows was the dreamiest. WiFi worked well, glad it was free. The bath area with big vanity and wet room was really cool. Bar was busy in the early evening, pours were expensive (but in Midtown everything is). Continental brekkie in the AM was fresh pastries and fruit, yogurt, cereal, coffee and juice.But there were things that could use some attention. One nice benefit to the big fluffy bath sheets is that they cover your clothes on hooks in the wet room because the room otherwise has no closet (at least mine didn't). There is no in-room iron or board (but they are delivered to you immediately if you request them) and egads, no in-room coffee service (but there is an all-night McDonalds in Times Sq, lovely to trudge to for coffee at 5AM). No clock radio either, so bring your own if you need an alarm to wake up (calls, of course, are available).The promised lockers in the qym do not exist, so if you want to use the exercise room, pool, sauna or steamroom, change in your room first. I made a 6AM trip for an early steam, only got weak and cold humidity in the hamman. So I tried the sauna, which was cold when I entered and got hot enough in 15 minutes...just then the workmen came in to repair the floor and let all the hot air out. This is at 6:15AM! I was miffed.But these are quibbles, for the vibe is great, the staff actually pleasant and eager to please (this is NYC? wow!), the facility still very new and spotless, and the bed is absolute heaven. Even as room prices start to approach $200, you still get good value and a great experience.

<Content>Cheap and Chic If, like us, you wanted a funky hotel without paying chic prices, QT Hotel is perfect. Stylish, simple rooms, with flatscreen TV and wetroom / bathroom. Note: the rooms are very *small.* But couldn't grumble, given the price. Staff very helpful and a simple breakfast is included (buffet / continetntal style).Literally a street from Times Square - where all the subways connect. So convenient for everywhere.Oh and the pool is open now :)

<Content>Great Stay! Excellent location, service, amenities, pool in the lobby open 24 hrs. is very sexy cool..the rooms are spacious, with large bathrooms. There is no restaurant but they offer many menus of local restaurants that deliver to your room (after they pass hotel security, of course) I stayed here 3 nights and enjoyed EVERY MINUTE OF IT! Don't even think about it, JUST BOOK THAT ROOM..

<Content>Great hotel Hotel QT was a great hotel - good location, nice staff, clean and the most comfortable bed I think I have ever slept in!The swimming pool looked great - bring your best swimwear - the pool is part of reception! But plus points were the lovely ladies sipping champagne in the pool each evening!Two negatives were there is no where to put your clothes - no drawers or shelves and in some of the rooms there are no doors for the shower so could be embarrassing if you are with someone you are less intimate with.Great hotel though, highly recommended.
