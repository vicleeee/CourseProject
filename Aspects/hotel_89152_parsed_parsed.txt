<Content>Stay away This is the worst hotel I have ever been since I was in college. The pics look cute so I was fooled. The truth is that there was no shampoo the night we arrived, I asked for some but they were out!!!, the body lotion was used, the TV control was out of batteries, the next day no one cleaned our room or changed sheets and towels and after staying there for 2 days of course no one thought of apologizing or at least replacing the shampoo. I was there for a conference and thank God I was not paying for it, but If I had to pay $290/night from my own pocket I would have called the police, the fire dpt. or both. Not recommended.

<Content>Think about it. My boyfriend and I arrived planned on a romantic weekend in New Orleans. Once we arrived to the hotel it was frightening!! It was located in a alley, we were both scared to death to get out of the car. Not only were we scared but there was so parking in front of the hotel to even unload our car. Once that was over we had to pay $30 dollars to have the car valet park offsite. Took 45 min to have someone find our car the next morning so that we could checkout. The room and bathroom were so small that two people could not walk around at the same time. The shower head was broken, the toilet ran constantly, and no water pressure even in the broken shower head. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. The pictures on the website look nothing like it when you actually pull up to this dump!

<Content>Great Hotel with Charm As a frequent New Orleans visitor it is always nice to find a hidden gem and this hotel is just that. The location is great. I have always stayed in the French Quarter or on St. Charles St. Both had good and bad points, this hotel has both. It is one block from the French Quarter and the casino, it's close enough but not that noisy. I love the elegance of St. Charles and the streetcar, and it still not too far away from the action. The exterior could use a makeover, however, when you enter the lobbly it is a different world. The furnishings are period with marble floors and nice paintings. The rooms were nice and clean with lovely drapes. The remodeling on the restrurant was noisy but no problem. Very nice employees. This certainly has old world charm Will recommend to everyone!

<Content>Never again!!! I was VERY disappointed when my husband and I arrived at the hotel. We were celebrating our first honeymoon/vacation together! The pics on the website looked very nice and the room decor looked very clean and well set up. Where did they take those pictures? Although disappointed and almost in tears, my husband got me to agree to stay! The first room we checked into was room 103. OMG... the lamp wouldn't work and the safe was broken. The t.v. was too small to even watch and it was in the armoire' which was broken and would not close. The room was so small that you could barely turn around in. They offered to take off the charge of the safe or give us a different room. I wanted a different hotel, but settled for a different room(room 203) with double beds because I figured it had to be bigger. Indeed! The room had more space and for the most part was clean. The tub could've used some TLC! The safe WORKED! However, one lamp didn't so we had what felt like a candle on the wall for light the whole weekend. We didn't say anything because we didn't intend on spending much time there anyway. Some of the electrical outlets did not work. The safe was small but I didn't have alot to put in there! I donated to the Harrah's foundation while I was there! LOL... You are charged 4.95 for local/long distance calling, internet. The signal is TOO weak to use in your room so if you wanted to spend anytime online you must sit in the lobby. The phone in our room. DID NOT WORK.. By this time I was NOT surprised by anything!! I, however, never seen a bug in the place.I almost forgot...The ice machine didn't work either! I WOULD NEVER SUGGEST THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE!!!! Our first time in New Orleans was a GREAT, AMAZING, EXCITING,(etc) feeling. NO THANKS TO THIS PLACE.The location of the hotel is the only thing it has going for it! HOWEVER.. there are several in the same area so get a room there!

<Content>Decent value I booked this hotel through a website that specialized in New Orleans boutique hotels. Because we stayed for 3 days, we were able to get a deal ($62.50/nt before extras and tax). Parking was extra, but we self-parked and found some deals just a short walk away.PROS: location - 1 minute walk to Harrah's and Canal Street; 4 minutes to Bourbon Street; 10 minutes to Cafe du Monde. Value - most hotels in the area are much more expensive. Old hotel with lots of charm. Free wireless (though our room had a weak signal). The bed was ultra, ultra comfortable!CONS: the smell of SMOKE! The lobby, the room, everything had an old smoke smell. For this entire part of my trip I had a sinus infection. There was no breakfast, and parking through the hotel was very expensive. The bathroom light stopped working and the safe (mandatory fee) was too small to hold a laptop. Barely big enough to fit our Harrah's winnings! ;-)

<Content>Horrible!!! Disgusting!! I read the reviews and boy were they wrong!! This hotel is horrible! The only decent thing was Darlene, the front desk clerk. She was very helpful with all the problems we had. Very noisy, A/C wouldn't work half the time. The so called antique beds were just old and gross and the posts blocked the view of the tv. We had to turn the bed sideways to see, the 12 channels they offer. We called for our truck and waited an hour and a half. The next day they brought it to early and we got a ticket. Overall, the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Would only go by to say hi to Darlene, hopefully from outside. Don't stay here unless the streets are full!!

<Content>Good Value and Location The Pelham is a boutique hotel with lots of charm. It's a unique experience and makes you feel closer to the New Orleans culture.Harrah's casino can be seen from the front door, Canal is one street over with shops and restaurants. Location is good, parking is up to you. I actually parked on the street at night for free at a meter. There is a lot across the street for $10 a day or you could pay the valet $28 for in and out privledged parking at the hotel. Bourbon and French Quarter are also close. It felt safe, lots of tourists in the business district. Good value hotel, I think I paid $65 off of expedia.com. All I can say is do your research and see if its for you. I would recommend the hotel as it was quiet at night and the beds were comfortable. The room has high ceilings and French decor. It was a nice change from the big franchaised hotels.

<Content>Overall a good hotel! I picked this hotel up for 77.00 a night for the last weekend in March.It takes a bit of navigational luck to drive to this hotel by car as all of the nearby streets are one way. I would definitely advise not parking in the surface lot across the street from the Pelham unless you will be leaving you car there and not moving it and like to wake up in the morning. You must pay your $10.00 a night into a box by 7am and if you arrive in the evening, you must pay $10.00 overnight and another 10 for the next day, ends up being a bit of a ripoff. The Harrah's Casino is literally a block away and the parking garage is 2 blocks (but connected underground to the casino as well). If you gamble for 30 minutes they will validate your parking and it is free, I did this for the remainder of our trip.Onto the hotel itself: The outside is nice but nothing spectacular, most of the buildings immediately around it are for sale and abandoned but this is by no means a bad part of the CBD to stay in. You can walk across the surface lot and be immediately on Canal St. or you can walk one block to the Harrah's Casino right off Canal as well. I'd advise only taking those 2 routes to the hotel though as most of the streets in the CBD are empty at night, but those two have high traffic all night long.The staff was relatively unfriendly but it did not bother me too much. They check you in/out and got me towels once, but did not seem particuarly interested at all. The room was actually pretty nice. Although the only light sources are the lamps and the windows. It is pretty dark inside the rooms even with the light on. But overall was comfortable and a nice place to stay. We stayed in 410 which has 2 double beds.This hotel does charge 2.95 for an in-room safe and 4.95 for wireless internet. I find these charges to be a bit ridiculous but since I got the room so cheap I didn't really mind, plus I used the wi-fi. I enjoyed my stay here. It is more convenient to Jackson Sq. and Cafe Du Monde, Decateur Street than a hotel I previously stayed on Conti St. above Bourbon.I'd recommend this hotel if you plan to visit Harrah's or need easy highway access on I-10 or 90. Overall it was a good stay and will stay here again if the price is right. Its certainly not a luxury hotel, nor does it have the charm of some of the FQ hotels, but it worked for us this time.

<Content>It's a New Orleans hotel... Now let me explain what that means. It means, there is no such thing as a value when dealing with hotels. You get what you pay for, and unless you drop a lot of cash, you're not getting a lot. Rooms will be small or seem that way since they're oddly shaped (unless you're staying somewhere on Canal or anywhere not the French Quarter). Hotels will have hidden fees. All hotels in New Orleans charge those weird phone and safe fees, even if you didn't use them. And you will pay a lot for parking, but you won't use your car the whole time you're there anywhere. So why not pay whatever they want to make sure your car is safe? And, the staff will be friendly. Now the Pelham is on the nicer end of a New Orleans hotel for what you pay. (You'll end up paying twice what you thought. See: hidden fees.) The room is a place to sleep and shower (both bed and bathroom were very nice). Big gorgeous windows, very clean, and nice housekeeping staff that won't just walk in when you don't answer in one knock! The convenience of the location, though, well it depends. For what we needed it was convenient. The hotel is a short walk from the casino and some shops and restaurants. The French Quarter is a little farther away, but FEELS much farther away in the heat.

<Content>Bearable, but barely. The main issues were cleanliness and functionality on top of the quaint hotel experience. I can take two average beds with a busted vanity chair, tight space, little storage, basic television service, and limited amenities - if everything's clean and on the up and up. When we arrived we got a very pleasant desk clerk working by her lonesome. We got in the room and were satisfied we paid a generally bargain price for what wouldn't be extra service but would do.My friend pulled out the vanity chair and discovered all the framework to support the legs were broken and hanging off of the chair. I opened the closet to discover the iron holder on the closet wall was broken and hanging off. The safe won't hold anything bigger than wallet/purse/passport/jewelry, and there was a really gross stain high on the wall above the closet. There were few plugs for charging cell phones, etc. We turned on all the lights and felt like we were in candlelight. Nice but hard to see.But the windows are very tall, there's crown molding, the decor was battered 18th century elegance and was cute enough. The bathroom looked great ... until further inspection.The floors had been cleaned but not as thoroughly as they could have been - like they'd been mopped but passed over so that soap residue still remained. There was some liquid at the foot of the toilet my friend covered with a towel before she'd use the toilet. I asked and received a shower chair from our very pleasant desk clerk - I had broken my foot - and was thrilled that she brought it up right away. However, the chair was disgusting and nothing you'd ever dare put your tush on. We pulled back the shower curtain and discovered a stained, soiled, battered, unpleasant, scary tub we would never dream of standing barefoot in.I went to wash my hands at the sink and discovered the two pulls worked in opposite nonstandard directions. This sounds weird, but test it on your hotel and home sinks - all pulls work a certain standard way. This one had one pull inverted. Doesn't prevent you from getting water but if you don't test it the opposite way you'd think it was broken.The pedestal base of the sink was grimy and the caulking was peeling away, so it was looking grody. Bearable - until, on turning the water faucet, the entire right side of the sink pulled away from the wall. The sink was basically not sturdily/permanently fixed in place and using the right-hand faucet displaced the whole thing from the wall. Not a huge amount, no, but come on. At this point, all your quaint details like tall french windows and a romantic pedestal sink are lost on me with the nasty tub and gimpy sink.It was late night and we realized there were not enough towels for 2 people. We called down and got a guy, who didn't seem particularly thrilled to get my call and might have been entirely sarcastic when he said Sure, when I asked for extra towels.Two hours later, no towels. I didn't bother calling down again.While we sat enjoying ourselves with some snacks watching the dark, old, small, non hotel-system tv (ie it's basic cable with nothing fancy like movies, etc.) a bug of some sort - we told ourselves it was NOT a roach, we just said it was a bug so we could sleep - crawled around on the nightstand and conquered our little bag of chips.We thought everything would look better in the morning and we'd persevere, since honestly the room just reminded us of San Francisco - a little grimy, but well meaning and well priced.But by the clear, unforgiving light of day that bathroom was just not looking doable. Add to that the required internet and service fees people mention and ... just too much going on to make it worthwhile.Next day, we checked out and headed for a chain hotel. Yes, sacrilege in a place like NOLA, but at this point reliable. Clean, sturdy, good repair rooms are a requirement, not a bonus, for ANY hotel.

<Content>a decent hotel for a great price The Pelham was a great bargain. We paid a total of $386 for three nights which was significantly less expensive than the other hotels in the area. The Pelham is located just off of Canal street in the Central Business District, an easy and safe walk into the French Quarter. The hotel was clean and the hotel staff was courteous. We did have a slight heating issue when we first arrived, the room temperature would no go above 64 degrees, but it was quickly fixed and the staff followed up to ensure we were no longer having a problem. The view is nothing to look at and there were no extra perks such as a newspaper or morning buffet. However, we were provided with a very generous 4:00 pm late check out upon request. There were a couple of convenience stores, as well as ATM machines, within a block's distance. The hotel did not have an ATM. Overall it was a perfectly pleasant stay for a very reasonable price. I would certainly visit the Pelham again.

<Content>it could have been better I was a recent guest at the hotel(8/17-8/18/07). I am originally from Louisiana and sometimes we go to the City and hang out for the night.I was disappointed in my stay--the air conditioner never got cold in the room(it remained stuffy and slightly cool),the water pressure was very low in the shower,but I'm thankful we had hot water.I really didn't like the charge of $2.95 for the room safe--even if you don't use it.I was able to get the telephone/internet charge removed from the bill before i checked out($4.95).The hotel should be more specific if they are going to charge for services you don't use or don't ask for!The young ladies that helped on friday night and saturday morning were delightful,very polite.Overall,there's still some work that needs to be done,but for a $77.00 a night,around the corner from the casino and across the street from canal place and the canal street--it's O.K.

<Content>A Nice place to stay July 27-29, 2007My hubby and I stayed at the Pelham for a weekend getaway. It was very nice, cozy and close to everything that we needed access to. The Riverwalk, Harrahs, Trolley stops, restaurants, The French Quarters are all within close walking distance.The hotel is very clean and our room , though small, met our needs quite well. We stayed in 401 and the WI-FI connection was very weak. But I enjoyed taking my laptop down to the table in the Lobby and 'people watched' while surfing the net. There is a lot of construction and rebuilding going on in that area so the outside view from the window was not good. A couple of small but noticable/correctable issues-The desk chair in the room was extremely shaky and we could not sit in it because of the danger of it breaking completely. Also, the bathroom mirror was super clean but had a terrible crack in the left hand corner, which kind of took away from the overall appeal of the room. But the counter top and sink were beautiful and the cracked mirror gave it a haunting effect.Darlene, Denise and Ms. Winnie were the staff that we had the pleasure of interacting with while there. Their hospitality was exceptional and their friendliness was genuine. If we needed it, they had it, or could tell us where to get it.Valet parking was worth every dime!We loved it and look forward to staying there again or visiting one of their other properties. One last Tip-Avoid the restaurant next door.

<Content>Like family... My first trip to New Orleans, first JazzFest, first trip all by myself (single female). This trip was a last minute adventure I took off on. I left full of moxie, and arrived at The Pelham full of apprehension. While I arrived way too early for check in (10:00am) Stephanie behind the counter and the Guest Service Manager (didn't catch her name) welcomed me like family. Calmed me down, reccomended items I needed for the festival, took my bags, and let me rest in the lobby (more like a parlor) until I acclimated to the humidity. When I was able to get into my room (about 2pm) I was surprised that I was in a room with no windows. But the A/C was about 50 degrees, and the antiques were charming. I realized after enjoying the evening that a room with no windows in New Orleans makes sense, the entire 4 days I was there I'm not sure I was ever aware of the time. The housekeepers were stellar in keeping up with cranky folks who just got in, and even skipped me and came back to clean one day at 5pm. I felt very safe in the location and honestly couldn't have asked for one better. A straight shot to Cafe Du Monde, Bourbon, The Casino, and almost on top of the shuttle stop for the JazzFest. All in all I can't wait to get back to Nawlins, stay at The Pelham, and get my groove on...

<Content>an average hotel...thats it... Check in = 4 PM (that is late, and they could not check us in at 1:30 PM)Check out = 11 AM (that is early)The mandatory fees for the safe ($2.99) and the wireless internet / unlimited local phone calls ($4.50) were annoying...We had a room on the first floor with no windows, which is strange but was fine (makes sleeping in very easy). The shower had no water pressure. The bed was fine, but nothing amazing. Overall, I would equate this hotel to a Holiday Inn. The hotel was in a very convenient location, 1 block from Harrah's, 3 blocks from Bourbon, and about a 10 minute walk to the Riverwalk. The price on the hotel was not bad (approximately $90 after taxes and the mandatory fees). The staff wasn't too friendly when we checked in, but they were very friendly when we checked out. I would stay here again if I was looking for a basic, clean hotel for a decent price.

<Content>Not a cookie cutter "express" hotel I read through the reviews after I had booked my room and was concerned by the negative ones until I arrived at the hotel.This hotel provided a more authentic feel to our new orleans visit and we wouldn't have traded our room for one at the Mariott or Doubletree down the street.There were some drawbacks to staying at an older hotel. This is a very unique experience based on what room you get. Our room the air conditioner never shut-off and our shower water pressure was low, but we enjoyed our crisp cool room, and I suspect not much can be done about water pressure in an old fourth floor hotel room.The Diner that is attached to the hotel fits perfectly with the hotel. It wears its age well. It has some great food, and a staff that is working hard, but dont expect linen and ice sculptures...its a diner.I would not recommend this hotel to someone expecting the cookie cutter, or the upscale. But for anyone wanting a well-priced authentic hotel stay this is the place.

<Content>Melvina made it wonderful! I really enjoyed this hotel and found it very high quality for the price. The staff is very warm and welcoming. The rooms and lobby have a charming decor. I stayed twice and was very happy both times. Nice central local but just off the main drag so it is not too noisy and you can sleep in.Melvina the receptionist was wonderful and so kind and helpful.

<Content>Grrrreat!!!! Check in was a breeze with Ms. Melvina Eddington! She made my husband and I feel welcomed in New Orleans and your hotel. She gave us information of places we could visit and different eateries locations and also asked us did we need a cab rather than use our van because of the parking. She was so sweet. I appreciate people like that! She was looking out for our well-being. The room attendentthat cleaned our room was very efficient. And your car attendents worked in record time.My stay at The Pelham was grrrrreat!!!! Lovely employees(Ms. Eddington, room attendent and car attendent), and beautiful look and at home feelings.Please inform Ms. Eddington that she made our time in New Orleans a very memorable one and thank her so much for her kind assistance and southern charm!!!!!!

<Content>The Pelham The Pelham Hotel is what you think of when you think New Orleans Style. It's probably the place where Maverick stayed, when he arrived on a riverboat, after a long gambling river cruise, a century ago.The Pelham relaxes in a refurbished, yet old-fashioned New Orleans charm. And, the staff know what Southern Hospitality really means.The location couldn't be better. The Pelham is two blocks from the casino, a block off Canal Street, and a comfortable two blocks from the hystirical French Quarter.Darlene, behind the front desk, as well as all the staff, are very attentive and knowledgeable. The manager, Ronnell Williams, is always there if you need him.There's a restaurant downstairs that serves breakfast all day (something that you'll find to be very important in New Orleans). And, there's vallet parking, although I strongly recommend NOT bringing or renting a car while you're in the Crecent City, as the Po Po (police) work overtime giving tickets to foreigners.I stayed at one of the big, expensive hotels my first few nights in New Orleans, and I honestly found the room at The Pelham to be better (and QUIETER).Why am I telling you all this? I've found a real treasure in the heart of New Orleans, and I should keep it to myself. But, what does it matter? You'll probably just stay at one of the big chain hotels, anyway. And then, you'll always wonder why everybody raves about the charm and warmth of New Orleans.Try the Pelham.

<Content>A mostly good experience... My wife and I ventured back to New Orleans last week for the French Quarter Festival, our first visit since the hurricane. As usual, I agree with most of the findings I read on Tripadvisor prior to our trip. The Pelham is a nice, clean, historic hotel definitely worthy of consideration, but it is obviously in a struggle against the rest of the city, pertaining to construction sounds, night police sirens, etc. The staff was very helpful, right from the beginning - to include switching us to a room with a window after we had viewed our first room. The parking situation is not good - avoid the thug in the outdoor lot across the street (the rate went from $20 daily to $40, once he thought I was committed. I fortunately found free curbside parking nearby). I witnessed a terrible situation with The Pelham's valet parking. Three young people dressed for a wedding attendance had waited the better part of an hour to still not have their car delivered - and claimed they had missed the wedding. Bottom line - their valet parking is probably not really valet parking, but rather the car being sent to a long term garage elsewhere. And don't venture out late at night (a true statement nowadays for that city in general). The hotel itself was wonderful, but the sounds and loud voices from midnight crime in the street made us happy to be sleeping on the third floor ,and was a reminder that we were again in New Orleans.

<Content>First timer in New Orlenes We stayed at the Pelham on our first trip to New Orlenes and it was a very good experience. The Hotel was Beautiful and the Staff was so courtious and helpful.. Melvina was our guest services agent and she helped us beyond what was required. One of our fellow travellers was ill and Melvina was just GREAT she got us in the room way before check -in was normally allowed and our friend was able to rest and recover. We will definately return to the Pelham for any future visits . The Hotel is right off Canal Street and close to all of the activities in the city. Walking to the French Quarter and Bourbon St. was a breeze. Harah's Casino is a mere block away. Valet parking made parking your vehicle and feeling that your car is safe a comfort.The HudspethsWashington Tx

<Content>Great location and service! A wonderful little boutique hotel in a great location that's very close to the French Quarter and to the Riverfront. The rooms are clean and classically decorated. Ronnell and Darlene in the front desk were especially helpful and very accomodating. Highly recommended and for only $46/night through Hotwire, you can't beat this!

<Content>A little Gem! Our family of five, including three teenagers was looking for a smaller, quiet hotel just off of the tourist track. Since we needed two rooms, we wanted something nice, but afforable. The Pelham is a gem! Just off mainstream Canal Street and a short walk to the French Quarter and the river front, it is a European type, upscale hotel with excellent service. The rooms are gorgeous, with high ceilings, large white moldings, floor to ceiling windows, luxurous drapes, and a large bathroom. Recently rennovated and redocorated, the rooms, lobby, and halls are classically tasteful and elegant. This is not a standardized concrete box hotel -- the rooms are all different shapes and sizes. Rosies Diner next door had great specials and generous servings -- the meat loaf was terrific. Ronnel Williams, Guest Sevices Manager at the Pelham, was exteremely helpful, outgoing, and friendly, as were all of the staff. He loves his hotel and treats you as his very own guest. All of this for only $85 bucks a room! Don't be fooled by some of the buildings near the Pelham. A few are still being repaired and some are just old, but the location is excellent. A Marriott, other large hotels, the museum, casino, and fine shopping are also just a block two away. Don't miss this one.

<Content>I needed to be moved I arrived early on Nov 2nd for a business meeting and asked if I could check in (super) early to get a shower in and leave my bag. The staff was very accommodating as it was 6:30 am. I was given a room on the 3rd floor. I never had a hotel room with no window before, but it wasn't that big of a deal. I took a shower and tried to get a 30 minute nap in. I was made aware of the thermostat issue (goes off if you leave the room) but had no success with any buttons. I could not get the room over 59 degrees. No nap for me...not a big deal, I would get it going when I got back in the evening.When I returned, I went to my room...same thing. I spoke to the gentleman at the front desk who's shift was ending. He contacted maintenance and told me they would be here later tonight but that it would be a few hours. I had been up for 27 hours now and needed some sleep. I asked for another room, but the property was sold out. He said the best he could do is give me an extra blanket.I tried sleeping in the 59 degree room with the extra blanket...not even close. I went back to the desk, and he was already gone. Jose was working and I advised him that I wanted to cancel my reservation, check out and go find a hotel elsewhere. He made a phone call and had me transferred to the St. James Hotel at no extra cost. I went from a box room with no window to a huge king room with a big LCD tv on the wall. I appreciated the effort the staff gave, and liked the lobby, location, and attached 24 diner, but unfortunately, the room I was given was a lemon.

<Content>Loved the Pelham! My husband, seven year old, and I went on vacation to New Orleans in early October. The Pelham was a beautiful establishment with a lot of historical character. We especially liked the location. It was close enough for walking distance to the Children's Museum, Riverwalk, and Aquarium. The manager was most hospitable. He continuously strived to make our hotel stay the best. He gave us many restaurant recommendations, etc. The entire staff was always very helpful in getting towels, a new remote control, etc. We definitely plan on staying in this establishment again.

<Content>Make your room request specific at the Pelham. Okay Hotel. Read this... Okay folks. I used Tripadvisor to check my travel arrangements. I looked at all the feedback for the Pelham; and, I called the hotel in advance to see if specific problems had been solved/repaired. Here's the skinny...The hotel is a pretty hotel in the lobby, no doubt. Saddly, the building across the street isn't; and, that's not the Pelham's fault. Be aware, if you are on the front side of the building, You will be woken by the city garbage trucks at or about 3:30 a.m. on or about Wednesday, for exactly or about 20 minutes. We booked a non-smoking, king room. At check-in, we were given room 408 (The clerk was aces all the way around...she was the best).Well here's the problem with room 408: the room had been smoked heavily in; the glass covering the furniture, end tables and such, was dirty; the carpet in the doorways had been torn and the sub floor was exposed; there was a silver dollar size spot of bubble gum (black in color) ground-into the carpet; the bed frame rails are held together by screws, of which the sharp ends are sticking out of the wood (cut my leg sitting on the bed for the first time but it's ok my partner is a doctor); there was a 3 foot grounding wire hanging out of the light fixture in the middle of the room; the bathroom sink was burned all round from cigarettes; the toilet seat was burned with a cigarette (I'm not sure how this happens???What are they smoking with?). Anywho, we made a complaint and we were quickly moved to room 217. Room 217 is the room you see on the internet photo, granted some time ago. It has a nosmoking sign on the door, something 408 does not. The room was okay, it didn't smell of cigarettes; however, there were some cigarette butts on the floor between the headboard and the wall. The decorative pillows on the bed had a variety of stains of which I didn't desire to know more. Someone's feet had been made to rest on the walls around the bed at matress level leaving an unmistakable stripe around the room. The bathroom was marble; however, there was an issue with the cigarette burns in the sink as well and dirt and mold were along the corners of the tub/shower, floor and grout lines. The floor was not mopped, nor was the mirror cleaned for two days.All in all not a bad room for New Orleans. Here's where their customer satisfaction policy kicked in full force!!! Fortunately, the corporate offices for the Pellam, St James, Le Cirque, Astor Crowne Plaza, Parc St. Charles, Lafayette, Chateau Dupre, Holiday Inn Express, Cotton Exchange, and Historic French Market Inn (all the same company) is located 1/2 block away at 517 Magazine. So I walked over, went to the 4th floor and explained to the CEO's office that I would like to clean my own room and meet the houskeeping lady so as to do. I told him that I didn't want my money back. We were not really upset and that we just wanted to stay as long as we could make the room cleaner. They were ever so wonderful. They offered to move us again, to the St. James, and give us another 2 day vacation to the city at their cost, in any deluxe accommodation of our choosing. So, all in all not a bad deal. Now, you want to see a GREAT review, see what I write at the St. James.As for the Pelham, it's an okay hotel. If you're not like me just this side shy of O.C.D. and you don't mind a little wear and tear, the Pelham is the one for you. Perfect for a prom party I'm sure! Oh yea, the parking is 20 dollars a day.

<Content>Get to The Big Easy It was our first visit to New Orleans and The Pelham was recommended to us by friends.We were not disappointed.The Pelham's attraction is instant the moment you walk through the hotel door.The staff are very welcoming and there's a personal touch which doesnt come with the big hotels.Some rooms are being refurbished at the moment so ask for a room on the top floor (refurbishment completed).The rooms are of a good size and cleaned to a high standard.The hotel is ideally placed being one minute from Canal Street and a 7 minute walk to Burbon Street.City Tour a must as is the Swamp Tour. These can be booked in the hotel.Finally, we would like to thank all the staff at The Pelham for helping to make our stay in their fantastic city a real pleasure.Get to New Orleans folks, The Big Easy needs you!!

<Content>Very Enjoyable Experience My wife  I booked our stay at the Pelham through Southwest Airlines and I must say, it was a very enjoyable experience...We've been to New Orleans many times in our 3 years together, but this was the first post Katrina trip...the hotel is in a great location, just a half-block from Canal...wonderful rooms with an unique floorplan to be sure...our room (#306) had 13 to 14 foot ceilings, huge windows, a nice size entryway and a rather wide  long hallway that led to the bedroom...the kingsize bed filled much of the room, leaving the chair and TV at an odd angle, but that's a very minor nitpick...bathroom was a nice size...front desk staff were very nice  very helpful...they were glad to give us a late checkout, extending our stay from 11am to 2pm and making that 4pm flight out, much easier...all in all, a very positive experience...the only thing missing would be a workout facility or at least an arrangement with a sister property to use theirs....and I very much agree with a pervious review...the food  service at the 24 hour diner next door, (used to be Huey's....now I believe Rosies) was HORRIBLE...in fact, that was our only bad experience of the entire weekend....dining tip...walk a couple of blocks down Decatur to Star Steak  Lobster House...been there every trip and Joey and staff never let us down !

<Content>Wonderful! Cozy! Clean! Great Service I visited The Pelham over the weekend which my husband and I were so glad I chose this hotel. We felt safe in this location. Although the street to unload, in which you have to do yourself,,,is a tad small when driving a SUV. They do offer valet parking for around $20.00.The hotel wasn't vast but served its purpose w/ a beautiful flare, and personality of the statues, long windows in the rooms w/ beautiful artwork, and decor. ( the view was of a run down building and lots of trash cans filled w/ garbage///maybe someone will buy it and fix- er' up so we can have a better view the next time )The staff: Ronnell, Jose Sanchez, and Stephanie (whom I spoke w/ days prior) were so helpful, accomadating, and fun. We stayed in a room that was a tad warm, and when we reported the problems we were moved to a much bigger, and cooler room! Several guest did have too much fun in the halls, and too much to drink by the odor the next morning! (which the staff worked to clean up)We ate at the restaurant off the lobby and the 1st night the food was wonderful. The frozen hurricane had a great kick, but the service was unknowlegible, and lacking personality. The next morning we decided to eat there again, but this time...the service was slow, the personality of the staff was still lacking, and after an hour or so wait,,,the food was cold, and horrible. ( it is opened 24 hrs... so this is a wonderful thing for thta late night snack or drink!)We will return to The Pelham the next trip we make to the Big Easy,,,and maybe the eating establishment will fix the service, so I can rave about them too. ( I think they mentioned about a cook not showing up,,and that was where the problems began!)Thanks to the wonderful staff for the great service, and fun time in the Big Easy . Texan traveler

<Content>Very Disappointing I chose this hotel because the web site made it seem attractive and service oriented and the person I spoke with when making my reservation assured me that that hotel was fully operational. I also wanted to support a locally run hotel rather than a big chain. I was very disappointed. Every day there seemed to be a new problem with my room and the staff on site were unable to handle it. In my six day stay I experienced no television service, no wireless internet connections, no replacement of towels and bugs on my curtains and on the bed. Additionally the quality of the housekeeping was sporadic. I was told by a staff member that the manager agreed to reduce the cost of the room, but at checkout I discovered that did not happen and the desk clerk was unable to correct the charges. Once again, there was no manager on site to speak with or to address my complaints. I would not recommend this hotel for tourists and I'll be rethinking my choice to stay at boutique hotels in the future.

<Content>The best place to stay when in the New Orleans area The Pelham is so beautiful, ambient and peaceful. The staff is the best that I have ever came across in my travels. If you are ever in the New Orleans area the Pelham is the place to stay. It is conveniently located near the French Quarter, Harrah's Casino, The Shops at Canal Place, the Riverwalk, the zoo, Imax Theatre and many other attractions.

<Content>Smiling faces at The Pelham We really enjoyed our stay at The Pelham and especially enjoyed talking with one of the young ladies who worked at the front desk, Lakeisha. She is an amazing person and a great asset to the hotel. We were in New Orleans just a week before Hurricane Katrina hit and we hope that the employees/friends we made at The Pelham are okay. Lakeisha, if you read this review, we want you to know that you will remain our favorite one! Doc and Tori O'Neil

<Content>Misleading Website I was very disappointed with this hotel. They actuallytried to put me into a room that had no window! The staff was not helpful... and would oftenannouce my room number in a loud voice (nota good thing when you are trying to stay safe).I would avoid this hotel.

<Content>A Jewel of New Orleans My wife and I travel to many locales when we get the chance. We recently stayed in the Pelham Hotel from the 7th of August until the 11th of August. First and foremost, the hotel has extremely nice decor. My wife and I both liked the antique furnishings and paintings. The rooms were a tad bit small, but very comfortable. The King sized bed was amazingly comfortable. We reserved a room with a Queen sized bed, but were given a King sized bed at check-in. I thought that to be indicative of a great first impression by the staff of the Pelham.Second, the staff was amazing. Lakeisha and Chris stand out amongst a star staff. The bellhops had an amazing knowledge of the area and were most helpful. The cleaning staff always welcomed us back with a kind greeting. Our bed was made perfectly and the room was cleaned each day. The majority of the staff would have an elevator waiting just seconds after you entered the hotel. Third, the price for one night is cheap! This is especially true in the off-season months of August and September. The hotel will give a 20 percent discount if you stay three nights or more. Our total bill was less than 500 dollars for 4 nights of stay. This included valet parking, safe fee, unlimited long distance and wireless connection. Having stayed at more expensive hotels, I would have to say that the Pelham ranks within a 4 to 5 star class of hotels. The Pelham is a true jewel of New Orleans. I would HIGHLY recommend the Pelham Hotel for all of your travel needs. I couldn't have been happier with my stay.

<Content>Great Hotel, Good Location We stayed at The Pelham August 19 and 20th. The staff was incredibly nice and very helpful. The location was fantastic, walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go and close to the trolley. The parking cost is reasonable. There are extra fees added on every night for the telephone and the room safe plus an added parking tax if you use the parking service. The room was clean and very nice. I thought the bed was fine but my boyfriend thought it was terrible and is still griping about his back hurting. My only real complaint is that it was impossible to get the temperature in our room below 75 degrees due to their energy saving system. If you are hot-natured, not the place for you in the summertime. We could hear all of the hall noise and door slamming but our room was next to the elevators. I think a room at the end of the hall would have been better. The temperature was the thing that kept me from giving it five stars.

<Content>A wonderful place to stay We had a marvelous trip, going to Japan and the United States. For two nights, the 12th and 13th of August, we stayed at the Pelham Hotel in New Orleans. The rooms were of old world charm, with high ceilings and a wonderful feel. As this place is close to both the French Quarter and Bourbon Street, it was very well located as well. The staff were outstanding in their service and manner.We would like to mention Lakeisha, Jamal, Doris, Denise and Chris H. who work there at the Pelham. They went out of their way to ensure that our stay was all that it could be. As we had not been to New Orleans before, and had booked this online, we were not entirely certain how good or not good it would be. However, it was not only good, and the price was right as well, but if we ever go to New Orleans again, we will stay at the Pelham. For anyone who reads this wanting to know where to stay, I am sure that there are many wonderful places in New Orleans that you can stay. But for us, the Pelham was the best place in New Orleans and we cannot recommend it high enough.

<Content>Good Place for a Great Price I recently got back from a weekend convention in New Orleans. I stayed at the Pelham Hotel and had a great experienced. It was in a good location and the price was almost half of all the other hotels around.

<Content>Absolutely Perfect It is hard for me to write this review because I was so pleased with every aspect of my stay that it is difficult to pinpoint just a few perks. First of all, Chris the desk clerk was extremely helpful and a sweet guy. Whatever we needed, the staff was always very prompt about seeing to our needs. I'm 20, and I'm an extremely fussy girl. But to my surprise i found our hotel room to be clean, spacious, and beautiful. The bathrooms had great lighting and extra towels were never a problem, we just had everything we could have wanted. Alright, now aside from the fact that our hotel was simply fabulous...we had the most incredible location! We were just off canal street, maybe 5 blocks from bourbon, 2 blocks from the riverwalk, 1 block from harrahs. I felt extremely safe and there really wasn't ever a need for a cab. For the price that we paid for the Pelham, we never expected such a luxurious hotel. It made our trip to New Orleans wonderful. Needless to say, I will always book the Pelham when i return to N'awlins.

<Content>Great Location/Staff I am writing about the wonderful experience my friends and I had staying at the Pelham in New Orleans. We were helped immediately upon arrival by Jamal. He was wonderful for anything and everything we required. When visiting the Pelham ask for Jamal....he is the best! Also a great help was Chris at the desk. He was very patient and kind to all of us Ladies. You know how things get turned around sometimes! We had lots of questions about tours, food, and entertainment. The Morton has great steaks and don't forget Bourbon Street! Take all the tours.. they are wonderful! And go out and have your Tarot cards read. Last but not least go by the flea market and Jimmy Buffets for a margarita. But stay at the Pelham. It has the best location and the best staff of anywhere in the world! My friends and I have stayed all over the world but this place was very special.Brenda BarrettLafayette, LA

<Content>Bump on the Head I started out very pleased with the hotel, small, but pleased as I only needed a place to fall asleep at night. Great location for what I was wanting to do; only a block from the Casino and 4 from Bourbon. There was an incident when a metal cover in the bathroom (roughly weighing 50 lbs.) fell on my head. Not all that bad b/c it only fell a foot before it hit me, but if it had been a small child or if I would have been sitting, the incident could have been a lot worse. The hotel staff did not seem at all concerned, took 30 min. to send someone up and when the manager was supposed to meet with me the next morning, she was not there and I had to talk to her on the phone while on my way home. She didn't even know the whole story once she did call, and even herself was not concerned until she found that it wasn't just a cover to a vent that had hit me but a 50 lb metal slab. It took a while to finally get things right with the corporate office and even then I wasn't totally satified with the results. Long story short, if not for the whole incident I would probably always use this hotel for my New Orleans travels but I think I might have to look elsewhere.

<Content>Excellent Reservations were made for us at this hotel. I had no idea what it would be like. We were extremely pleased with everything. The hotel staff was so helpful and friendly. I had some questions before we arrived and each call was handled in a very friendly manner and everyone was so helpful. It was spotless everywhere. The hotel had been refirbished nicely and a fairly small hotel in terms of number of rooms, but big on style and so friendly. We would stay there again without question.

I look forward to staying at your fine hotel again hopefully soon. Thanks Michelle Holmes Monroe,Louisiana

<Content>Great experience We were pleasantly surprised by the Pelham Hotel. Everything was beyond our expectations.......it is furnished beautifully with historical accuracy and good taste. The room was quiet with heavy drapes that kept out the light. The staff is very helpful, friendly, and efficient. The bed is comfortable, the sheets lovely, everything more than adequate. The only correction we would make is to put more towel racks in the bathroom.

<Content>Great, but not perfect So, I really did like this hotel. We went down on a bachelor party and stayed in three rooms. ROOMS: One room was big, airy, and beautiful (though they said it had queen beds and only had doubles). The second had no windows, which I actually liked because it was easy to sleep. The third, was supposed to have twin beds and did and was very nice. The rooms were not small but not big. In the rooms likes the biggest PROBLEM of them all. New Orleans is HOT and the rooms AC only pumps cold air when people are inside them thanks to a motion sensor. Our rooms were thus always hot when we got back and I had to BRIBE the maintenance guy to help us out. He put in a fan, which helped, but here's a big tip. Bring a balloon with helium that can bounce around and keep the AC going.SERIVCE: Everyone was friendly, especially Denise Austin, the desk clerk. The only problem was that I called to confirm three queen sized rooms on the same floor on the day we arrived, did so, and then found out that the confirmation had never been entered into the computerOTHER: Wireless internet is nice, but it doesn't work everywhere and their is a $6 a day charge whether you use it or not (though they are very nice and remove it if it doesn't reach your room). There is also a pay-for-internet computer in the lobby. Finally, there is $3 per night safe charge.LOCATION: PERFECT!!! Quiet area in a little side alley right off Canal Street, a 30 second walk to the Casino and a 2 minute walk to the French Quarter.OVERALL: Not bad, thought lots of little annoyances. Worth, I would said, about $75-$100 a night.

<Content>Great Place My mom and I recently had the chance to stay at the Pelham Hotel in New Orleans and the trip and stay was wonderful. The hotel was not the hotel we expected to stay in but it was where we were meant to be. The hotel was nice and clean and the staff was really nice. I had the pleasure to meet people who did everything to make our trip as memorable as possible. Denise, Tim and Jamal were available to answer any questions we had about the city. Questions like where to eat, shop or sites to see. Elizabeth never wasted a minute to get me extra towels when I needed them or to reassure me that she was available for whatever I needed. She would even push the elevator button for me if she saw me coming. Chis who I met on the last day before checkout was also very pleasant and helpful.Everyone had such a wonderful spirit from the time we arrived until we left. I would recommend the Pelham Hotel and their staff to all of my friends who visit New Orleans.

<Content>Great Place to Stay! I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. Tim, Jamal, Denise, and Lakeisha were all very helpful. They knew our names and were very friendly and helpful. The room was nice, clean, and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is considering visiting New Orleans.

<Content>Fantastic Staff and Stay at the Pelham My husband and I had a fantastic stay at the Pelham! The staff, especially Lakeisha, Denise, Chris and Tim were very professional and helpful. The room was very comfortable, and we slept soundly on the queen sized bed. We travel a lot, and if back in New Orleans, will try to stay here. Highly reccommended!

<Content>very nice... We just got back from New Orleans - this was our third trip to the city. We had no idea about this place... the Pelham is centrally located to everything! We had some of the best restaurants right in our neighborhood (Restaurant August, Cuvee, Palace Cafe), we never walked more than 2 blocks to eat - and I mean, we ate good. The hotel was our biggest surprise... the room was spacious, super clean, and tastefully decorated. We really felt right at home. My husband was surprised one day when the manager, who was passing through the lobby, asked us if we were enjoying our stay! We are use to desk clerks, bellman, etc asking us how things are going. But, at this hotel, you could see that everyone truly cared about your stay.

<Content>Personal Touch at the Pelham We had a very comfortable stay at the Pelham Hotel. What really stood out was the friendliness of the staff. They all took the time to learn our names and greeted us each time we entered the lobby! We want to thank Denise, Austin, Lakeisha, Jamal and Timothy for a wonderful stay. Thank you for making us feel so at home. Mr. and Mrs. Chase

<Content>Mixed Message Loved our room. It was a charming room on the end of the hall, very cozy, with a brick wall. The accommodations were quite good. Lekeisha, the front desk clerk was outstanding, very patient and accommodating. Tim, the bell hop was helpful as well. Both were extremely pleasant people. That said, we had a couple of issues: The STRONG smell of marijuana coming through our bathroom vent was a little much, to say the least. Can't imagine how the room smelled where the smoke was coming from. It took an one hour and forty-five minutes to have our car delivered to the door. We eventually found out our car had been delivered to the wrong hotel around the corner. The parking charge was removed. It was Essence weekend in New Orleans and we were not prepared for the crowds. I believe if it had been a non-event weekend, the Pelham would have been an excellent choice. Great location, two blocks from the Quarter.

<Content>Lakeisha, Chris H., and Tim were awesome! We had a most enjoyable stay at The Pelham. We were only there overnight, but three of the outstanding employees made a lasting impression on us. Tim, Lakeisha and Chris H. They were congenial, courteous and very professional. The next time we are in New Orleans, you can be sure that we will stay in The Pelham.

<Content>Hotel is nice but the staff is the best The Pelham is in a good location, rooms are clean and hotel is quiet.The front desk staff sets this hotel apart from all others. I cannot say enough great things about Tim, Allen, Lakeisha and Denis Austin. They are young upbeat individuals that have infectious personalities.I do plan on returning to New Orleans this fall and I can guarantee you that I will be returning my business to the Pelham due to the great service I received. Cannot say enough good about these people. Thanks again for everything.

<Content>Beautiful room, friendly service. I loved my room. It was beautiful. Antique furnishings, great ambience... The people there were so nice, they even booked a last minute lunch cruise for us for the next day, (it was 3 oclock in the morning when we got around to booking and they were just as friendly at that time as they were at check in). My friend's flight was at 4 o'clock and we were allowed to leave our luggage there after checkout. It was a fabulous experience, so much so that I wouldnt stay anyplace else. Thank you to Denise Austin, Lakeisha Wilson and Tim Walker for making my stay at the Pelham so agreeable!

<Content>Prefect Hotel Stay We have a core group of 6 girls that get together once a year for a long weekend away from husbands and kids. This year was our first trip to New Orleans. The Pelham was the perfect Hotel for us. The staff was GREAT. Everyone was so friendly. We even enjoyed the coffee shop next door. The Pelham was centraly located to all we did. When we go back to New Orleans we will stay at the Pelham.

<Content>Wonderful Staff Two of my girlfriends and I spent a long weekend in New Orleans, and our stay at the Pelham was great. We're all in our early 20s, so we didn't expect to be taken seriously by anyone at such a nice establishment. What a pleasant surprise to find everyone from the managers (like Denise) to desk clerks (especially Denise A. and Lakeisha) to the bell hops (Marvin) not only helpful but wonderfully friendly! A quiet atmosphere, just steps from the hustle of Canal and Bourbon Sts.

<Content>The staff is great! The Pelham is in the heart of downtown New Orleans, but you will never find a staff better than what Pelham has to offer. Lakeisha and Denise were so wonderful. They made our visit to New Orleans fantastic.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay The hotel was clean and quiet. However, the best feature was the people working there. Everyone was polite and eager to help. Itzel, at the front desk, was everything a vacationer could ask for. We enjoyed our stay

<Content>Excellent Choice The location of this Hotel was excellent. Walking distance to everything from the Convention Center to the Casino to the Quarter to excellent eating places. And to have one of the best 24/7 diners around in the Lobby was a huge plus for the those early morning needs. The staff is excellent! From the doorman to the front desk to the GM Denise, all where they to help in anyway possible. For the price and location, this was an excellent choice of hotels for our group!

<Content>Great Small Hotel I am on the road all the time and I was delighted to find this gem of a hotel in New Orleans. The beautiful Itzel greeted me at the front desk with a smile and made sure that my stay was a pleasant one. The friendly 鈥淐oach鈥?Ralph helped me up to my room with my luggage and was on the job all week to solve any problems that I was having. I had a minute with the manager and she impressed me with her dedication to excellence. There is no honor bar in the room and it may not have all the bells and whistles of every hotel but if you are looking for Southern Elegance with antique furniture, eighteen foot ceilings, a marble bath with a pedestal sink and a room that would inspire you to write 鈥淎 Street Car Named Desire鈥? then this is the place for you. It is a half block to the casino, or one block to the French Quarter, and on the corner of Magazine, which takes you to the Garden District with all its antique stores. It is one block from the Bon Ton Restaurant, which is a must for lunch. Order a cup of gumbo, crawfish etoufee, and their killer bread pudding with bourbon sauce and it will be on your schedule for every New Orleans visit in the future.

<Content>Fantastic Staff, Great Location! The staff at the Pelham was superb, especially: Denise, Lakeisha, Pamelea, Marvin, Itzel, Ralph, and Tim. The hotel was quaint and very conveniently located to everything - you don't need to rent a car if you stay here. Huey's Diner, which is attached, is a wonderful and tasty treat. Our room was a little worn, but very clean. I would stay there again.

<Content>Great Staff, Clean Room, Great Location The staff was great - we had to wait for our room as there was a heating issue but were treated like gold as we waited. The room was clean, plush robes, nice four poster bed. The staff remembered our name and talked to us as we went in and out. They gave excellent suggestions for restaurants and were more than willing to assist with tour information and location/map questions. Lakeisha and Denise at the front desk went out of their way to make sure we were well taken care of. Upon leaving we had them store our bags and I needed to change - they insisted on letting me go into an empty room to change instead of the hotel restroom. Called for our taxi and had it there when we were ready to go.The restaurant (Huey's) is only so-so. Not sure if it is part of the hotel or just located beside the hotel. Not bad food - just not wow! We would definitely go back to the Pelham - great location! to everything!!

<Content>Perfectly nice hotel I read all these reviews AFTER I booked the hotel and became VERY nervous! Unfounded. My husband arrived first for his conference; I met him a few days later. He said the room was VERY small, but clean and comfortable. It didn't have a window, but that's not a big deal. However, he asked to change rooms after his 2nd night because there was some air conditioning thing outside his room that clicked on before 6 every morning and made noise. The folks at the Pelham were very nice and had no problems doing that. When I arrived, it was to the new room. It was still small, but lovely. Everything was very clean and remained so throughout our stay. The only thing someone might be upset about is the fact that they were doing construction on the building across the street from our room (we had a window this time) and they started around 6:30am! However, we were already up but someone recovering from the previous night may not appreciate it. But that's not the fault of the hotel - just make sure you ask for a room not overlooking that side. And in regards to the neighborhood, I was a female alone while my husband was in meetings, and I felt perfectly fine going back and forth. There is a homeless shelter across the street on one side of the building (not the entrance) but it's not unsafe - I walked by alone several times and no one even looked at me, much less harassed me. And it is literally a block from the Quarter - totally within walking distance. For us, the stay at the Pelham turned out fine.

<Content>great staff. While in New Orleans two of my friends and myself stayed at the Pelham. The staff there was excellent, especially Lakesiha (sorry if the spelling is wrong). She was bright, helpful, positive and professional. The room wasn't the best but I'd seen alot worse. One of my friends is a clean freak and she wouldn't drink out of the cups provided. Overall my stay was pleasent and the location was great, being on the outskirts of the French quarter helped me and my friends walk off all the food we had eaten.

<Content>DO NOT stay here if you have been spoiled by other hotels! We recently experienced the Pelham. We had wanted to try a hotel in New Orleans with a rich history, and originality. Well, it was historic and original, but not what we expected. First of all, it is on a terrible street. Dirty and inconvenient. No real entrance, and we never saw any kind of valet as I have read. There is no room service, no in-room movies, no bellman, no ice or pop machines, and a very limited choice of rooms. The rooms are very, very old and the bedding is old as well. The rooms are adequatly clean, but the hotel is on a very loud, industrial corner, so don't expect to be able to sleep in after a night of paryting!! There is a 24 hour restaurant in the same building but like I said, no room service!! (I hated that!!!). The staff was friendly enough but we did not receive the room we reserved, so the first night my husband and I had double beds. We had a room with no windows, NONE!! Weird!! With so many hotels, and so many other choices in New Orleans, there is no reasons whatsoever why anyone would choose to stay at the Pelham. We moved into another hotel after 2 nights, (of a 4 night stay). No bellman to help with luggage. I had to bring the luggage cart upstairs, by myself, and load and unload my luggage. The cab wait was very long...(I don't think most of the cabbies even know where this hotel is!)  I need modern conveniences, others may not mind. But for the price, which we thought was extrememly pricy for what they offer, you can get much better hotels for a much better price. The Pelham is a major rip-off!!

<Content>Will never stay here again! My husband  I stayed here two years ago, but I just learned about TripAdvisor and wanted to let everyone know what a terrible experience we had staying at The Pelham.Overall, we were fairly pleased with our room, pretty roomy and decently decorated, though we had a terrible view. But in NOLA, we don't spend much time in the room anyway, so that was fine. The worst part of our experience was upon checkout. We waited and waited (and waited!) for the valet to bring our car. We must have waited almost an hour in the lobby. When our car finally did arrive, our ignition key was completely chewed up. The valet handed us our key like nothing had happened, and when we demanded to know what had happened, they said that they'd used our key to put into another car and it had gotten stuck. So, they had to cut it out of the other car's ignition. While this was completely crazy, what was crazier was that they acted like there was no problem with handing us back a gnarled ignition key. Completely oblivious. Because the staff at the desk was so unprofessional and unhelpful, we asked to speak to the manager. Here's were the story gets even crazier, the manager would not even come down to see us, he wanted to speak to us over the hotel phone. He offered to reimbuse the cost to have a new key made, but sounded like he could really care less. What kind of manager does not want to speak to a customer face to face?We will never stay at this hotel again, nor would I ever recommend this hotel to anyone. PLEASE, go elsewhere.

<Content>Feel Welcome in New Orleans I would definitely stay here again. I came to New Orleans for a conference that was at the Marriott Hotel (too expensive for me) so I looked on hotels.com and found the Pelham, close by, much cheaper. I arrived on a Saturday night. Just a point...I am not a night person, I like mornings, I am pretty quiet (although I like talking) and I was on my own. So, when I showed up, I was hungry, tired, and lonely. PLUS, I was given what is called an interior room which is a room with no windows...great for college students on a bender who don't want to see the sun all day, but not so great for myself. So, this, coupled with the fact that the wireless internet in my room did not work, (low signal), started to depress me and I really thought I was going to move. HOWEVER, on the advice of the front desk worker at the time, I came down to the lobby and used the internet there...that turned out to be a REALLY REALLY good idea.Let's be fair. This is New Orleans...what are you really coming for? And what was the original purpose of the 'hotel' concept throughout history? HOSPITALITY. And that is PRECISELY what I got when I came down that night. I can use names, because I think the staff will be there for a while. There is a woman who works front desk named Ixtel who absolutely charming and takes a personal satisfaction in the well-being and happiness of all her guests, and a genuine regret when things don't exactly go right. I actually got to observe this firsthand, as I was on the internet a lot and thus sat in the lobby for hours on end, working. ....so I got to see her warm and professional interaction with everyone that came through here. She is the reason that I did not change my reservation to another place that first night. This is what a small hotel should be...a warm, caring staff who want to take care of you! There are others as well: Lakeisha works front desk, and changed my room Sunday morning to a better one, after all the benders checked out. She was extremely welcoming, professional, and gave me pizza. Tim (bellhop) is a very calm and mature young man, and always willing to help, but never pushy. Everyone is willing to offer recommendations of places to go, or perhaps just sit and chat and ask you where you are from.Who would not want to stay here?I suppose if you want an ultra-clean hotel, or you simply are looking for a place to crash, or like hi-rises or whatever, then sure go check somewhere else out. But I have to say I'll stay there again. I don't care that it's next to a soup kitchen. Plus, I think it's getting better.

<Content>Don't stay at the Pelham June 2004 We were very disappointed in the hotel. The pictures and description looked great. The staff was very unpleasant. They charge you for a safe and unlimited phone usage upon your check in even if you do not want it. They valet parked our car and lost it. They brought us someone else car. We had to go to the parking lot and identify our keys. After losing over an hour with this , we were to be credited for parking on our charge card. This was never done. They refused to our credit card company 's remove the charge. Our room was right behind the front desk and on the sidewalk. It was very noisy. We never saw any of the plush robes or nice touchs mentioned in their amenities. I would never send anyone to this hotel.

<Content>Great location,great staff, but....... My sister, son and made a last minute trip to New Orleans, we confirmed reservations twice at another hotel, but once we arrived, we were told to go to the Pelham. The staff was GREAT!, the lobbby was nice. Our room was much smaller that what we were promised at the other hotel, with a 2 year old you need room. The shower had no pressure and was filled with black hairs. The robes were dirty, the comforters were dirty, there were also black hairs in my bed and my sister found old toenail clippings in hers, along with a booger on her pillow. The last straw was when I went to make coffee, the maker was dirty, and the cups were so dirty they still had lipstick on them. That was when I called the front desk. They changed us to a better room without arguement, but we noticed cleanliness was not a high priority. We also noticed the aweful smell in the hallways. But like I said, the staff was great!

<Content>disappointment at the Pelham I was disappointed in the cleanness of the room, It was terrible, the hotel also had a bad smell especially the loby and the elevator (like Raid roach spray) the staff was good for the most part. The location was good and bad at the same time if that possible. It was a good overall location to get to all the hot spots but the streets around it was bad with a homeless shelter across the street, I didn't have a prblem with the homeless shelter but I did have a problem with all the homeless people outside the shelter and not inside late at night. Finally I don't know if the extra $8.00 + taxes per night is a hotel rule or a state law but I didn't know I had to pay it until I checked in.

<Content>It was the bomb My friend and I really enjoyed our stay in New Orleans. We booked our Hotel through Orbitz and it was ready when we arrived. We were greeted at the front desk and told about all charges that was not collected online. The front desk was also helpful with food and entertainment recommendation. The room was very nice and clean with plenty of towels. When we visit New Orleans again we will stay at the Pelham.

<Content>The Heart of New Orleans Great service, the staff is very friendly and helpful. Located near all you can do. Try the restaurant, the french toast is great. Beautiful antique rooms. It's what New Orleans is all about.

<Content>Be Very Careful THE BAD:My room had no window, a crusty blanket and a couch that was even dirtier. There was no hot water in the sink. The amenities are standard at best. The front desk clerk didn't care (possibly stoned?). The wireless internet that you must pay for did not work. If you stay, plan on another $ 8.00 plus tax a day for the safe and long distance. NO EXCEPTIONS. There appears to be a homless soup kitchen accross the street but I only stayed 1 night, so I did not confirm this. This was my worst New Orleans hotel experience in 10 years.DISCLAIMER:I spend 100+ nights a year in hotels, about 1/2 in New Orleans, usually mid to upper quality. In fairness to the hotel, I recieved a good review from a friend who also recently stayed at the Pelham. All hotels owned by the Decatur group charge the $ 8.00 per day extra (Cotton Exchange, St James, LeCirque, Lafayette, Holiday Inn Express on Corondelette, and the Historic French Quarter Inn and others)

You know the same line hotel gives you,,especially with the good price we found online... well for once someone told the truth. we were very happy with the whole experience. the crew there was great... from Ms. Lakeisa at the front desk to Timothy to Darvelle.. i would recommend the Pelham to anyone who wanted a nice quiet, clean place to stay!!!!

<Content>I paid less and got more My friends and I recently stay at The Pelham Hotel, in New Orleans, and I ENJOYED myself. The staff was wonderful they made sure we had the time of our life. They give us directions on where to go and where not to go. They sent me and my friends on a great tour around the city. The room we stayed in was nice and cozy and made me feel like I was at home. We had a really cheap rate, which was great, this is the first situation I paid less and actually got more. We plan to travel back to New Orleans in the future and we have already decided to make reservations with The Pelham. Thanks Pelham.

<Content>SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR A PLEASANT STAY The Pelham isn't nearly as horrific as the reviews here; however, there are some things to be aware of:1) Location: This hotel is located near most every attraction one can visit and is perfect for a long weekend stay. Harrah's is two blocks, Canal Street is one block (thus very near the French Quarter) and the Riverwalk and Canal Shops are about 3 blocks. It's a hotel perfect without a car (I rented a vehcile and used it once in three days to drive out to the Garden District). Be wary though as it is located two doors from a Soup Kitch (as is the much more expensive Best Western across the street). New Orleans has a large homeless population, so you probably won't get away from it at any downtown hotel.2) Hotel Staff: I had a very pleasant experience with the front desk staff at the hotel. Not only were they professional when necessary but they new we came for a good time and offered suggestions on food and things to see we wouldn't have ventured to without the suggestions. HOWEVER - in the three nights I was at the hotel, housekeeping never cleaned the room. They came by Saturday morning at about 8AM and I requested they return in shortly as I was still dressing. No return. Sunday, no housekeeping.3) Cautionary advise: The Pelham is currently available for $69.00 per night on the internet. This excludes approximately $7.00USD in vault and long distance charges but they advised me at check in to make sure I was aware of the additional fee. This also excludes parking. Valet parking is available at the hotel for $17.95 per day with in and out priveleges. This isn't a bad price for valet service as many other places charge $25.00 for 24 hours no in and out. Also, the internet specials available, such as the Vodoo Bonus Package and the $20.00 per day voucher require you to print the page or request same when making your reservation. I lucked out and had my laptop to get online and get the page with the specials on it. Use the $20.00 voucher at several restaurants. I recommend The Lafayette Sports Bar as they had good burgers ranginging from $6.00 - 8.00 (nearly enough in the voucher to feed 3 people a day and plenty for 2. Huey's 24/7 next door has a few very rude members of staff and only so so food. The prices are weighted.4) Rooms: The rooms of the hotel are spaces and mostly comfortable but not four star quality. The glass in one panel of our bathrrom window was taped in precariously and the chair at the desk was splitting a bit and probably soon to fall. Also be advised that the bathrooms have only light curtains in them and a large window that can (depending on your room number) face another hotel. People can see in your room easily at night and you can see out (could be good, could be bad depending on your likes). Hang a couple of towels over the bathroom window for more privacy.Overall we had a most pleasant stay at the Pelham (the time we were actually in the room).

<Content>Great, intimate hotel This hotel was great! Each year me and a group of college friends meet here in the summer. We have stayed at several other hotels in the city. The staff was wonderful. The hotel manager and her staff did an impeccable job making us feel welcomed. I can't say enough about how this year was the best because of their hospitality and wonderful accomodations.

<Content>Terrible Hotel, Rude, uncaring employees Service was terrible from check in. The person checking us in was on the phone with a personal call. He never got off the phone the entire time he was checking us in and provided us no information. When we arrived in the room the water in the bathroom sink was a muddy orange color and the air conditioner never would cool below 74 degrees. Since it was the end of June that we were there needless to say it was HOT!! We will NEVER stay at this hotel again, and we visit New Orleans at least 2 - 4 times per year.

<Content>Organization  The Pelham Hotel, May 9-13, 2004You have heard, if you can not say something nice then do not say anything at all! Okay, the Pelham staff is very friendly and courteous! With that said now we can continue with the other items of our review during our stay for which we were the administrators of three meetings with 35 people arriving from all over the United States.Meetings must be organized and are planned per contract with the hotel months in advance. You would not expect,1.The meeting room to be musty and moldy when entering the room, we were expected, Yes!2.The furniture to have an eighth of an inch of dust on the chairs and the table cloths soiled.3.For the meeting room not be prepared until the last minute.4.For refreshments not to be ready as contracted. You should not have to ask for plates and silver ware. Desert dishes not available and neither was the desert until we asked. 5.The meeting room for our events not to be published in the lobby and our agenda鈥檚 were incorrect from information given to us by the hotel. Cleanliness of the rooms and unexpected functionality was an understatement as follows:1.The third floor was in the process of being painted, therefore you had to tolerate the unhealthy smell of paint fumes, paint buckets, and drop cloths in the hallways.2.For fun in the mornings, see how many aunts you can count on the bathroom floor. What an unexpected recreational event, but not as good as games on your laptop however the Internet connection was not working!3.How about a reality show instead? Walk into the room and have the air conditioning until fall from the ceiling and miss your body by inches.4.Wade the water saturated carpet from the bed to the bathroom in several rooms. Now this is taking cleanliness seriously!5.Sure we all have had to request additional towels and/or coffee from housekeeping, but we did not expect to wait two days nor be told by the staff they would check for availability.6.Normally a hotel room is cleaned on a daily basis unless you leave your privacy indicator on the door, not the case at this hotel. Even if the room was cleaned, the same removable soil on the carpet remained for the entire stay. Wonder what kind of vacuum cleaner they use?7.Television does not work! Well, what did you expect? One ice machine which works some of the time and the vending machine was out of order.8.Toilet clogged and the maintenance staff needs assistance. How difficult can it be to use a plunger? Once unclogged, towels are used to clean up the spills in the floor.9.Blankets are obviously soiled and housekeeping does not replace.Suggestion: Do not wear white gloves to this hotel!

<Content>Wouldn't want to stay there After reading the reviews, we decided to stay at the Holiday Inn on Royal St. We walked to the Pelham one day, and weren't impressed with the location. In fact, we would not want to walk there after dark. From Canal St., you walk down Magazine St. one block to Common. It is on the corner of Common and Magazine. The block was deserted. There were homeless looking people sitting on the street. The hotel looked nice. We went in and saw the lobby. It was nice. I would not want to stay there.

<Content>Most UNpleasant!!! We live close by and stay in New Orleans often. We have stayed at nearly 20 hotels in New Orleans and this was by far the worst! We checked in early and the room was not ready, so we pre-registered, then they gave the room we asked for to someone else. We got a SMOKING room with a BROKEN A/C, it took two hours to move us to a different room. The new room was still smoking and the water barely tricked out of the bath tub. And our view was a homeless shelter just across the street. We were not offered any compensation by the management, only apologies by the very nice and helpful bell boy, who then told us the original room we were put in was a $65 room, when we paid $95 a night!!!
