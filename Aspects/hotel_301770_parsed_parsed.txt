<Content>not the best location Nice hotel, classic room decor, similar to other St Regis hotels. Big objection was to location, in embassy district, no good local restaurants. Yes, it is close to the silk market, but the pearl market offers better goods at cheaper prices and the sellers don't hound you nearly as bad. It is a 2-3$ taxi ride away.We stayed at Raffles on the second trip, they included breakfast, and are one block from Tianamen and the forbidden city.

<Content>Terrible St Regis Beijing i have stayed 2 nights at the st regis beijing from 25th to 27th dec in room 1522. I wished to describe my experience.It was one of the worst hotel that i have ever stayed: reason being the attitude of the staff(some.. not all)i was going back to my room one day from shopping at the silk market. I asked one of the staff near the lift, the location of the health club. The staff scanned me and the cheap looking plastic bag of clothes i was holding and rudely asked me where did i came from. I politely told him i was a hotel guest but he gave me a despised look.thereafter, he rudely told me the way to the health club.i know i went shopping for clothes at a cheap place but i think i did not warrant the kind of despised looks that the staff had given us. My friend who was with me felt exactly the same way too.That day, i almost wanted to leave the hotel but after paying a bomb for the room, i stayed on.there seems to be a differentiation of treatment for foreign western guests as compared to local chinese( i am from singapore). they were all smiles and everybody seems to be extra helpful to them. Nobody was at the door to hail us a cab when we wanted to go somewhere.there were missed reservations at the restaurants that we had asked the conierge to book.The bed i had was also creaky and was not balanced. when u lie on one side of the bed, the other side would move. just like a seesaw. When your partner moves, you will greatly feel the movements.However, the service for some of the staff are quite good. For example, the doormen who not only spoke excellent english, but was very helpful. We only see him in the day.The butler and telephone operators were very friendly too.But if given a choice, would i go to st regis beijing again? I dont think so. The hotel should learn from regent beijing( the beds are nice and not creaky and service is excellent) The aman @summer palace service is out of the world and is one of the best i had ever experienced.for the value of money for this hotel... please stay elsewhere. the regent beijing is excellent in every ways.

<Content>Wonderful St Regis My husband and I recently stayed at the beautiful St. Regis, Beijing.We did not see this hotel before the renovation but loved what we did see.We stayed in a beautiful suite, well furnished, impeccably clean with all available amenities. We were greeted with graciousness as we stepped out of the taxi by the concierge who spoke excellent English and handled luggage,check-in etc with professionalism.We did not encounter any language issue and in fact found the front desk staff so willing to help us book tours, navigate the city on our own as well as translate many English directions into Chinese so that we would be spared any difficulties explaining ourselves in a foreign taxi.We dined in the hotel, had a spectacular buffet one evening for dinner (do not read American style buffet) this was a classy meal, enjoyed a wonderful Italian meal in Danieli's and found breakfast and other light meals ordered from room service to be on time, well presented, correct and hot !!We slept well in the beautiful bed, appreciated the clean lovely linen, found the bathroom clean and well stocked with fluffy towels and other essentials and were delighted by the butler.( Is this a treat ??)This was a very special experience. The staff were well trained, discreet and so very helpful to English-speaking westerners.This was our first trip to China and we were so delighted by the amazing sights, the delicious food, the helpful people and of course our stay at the St. Regis. Thank you for wonderful hospitality.

<Content>Pretty good hotel but not quite there yet Stayed for three nights in September 2008 in a Premier Room. The hotel has recently been renovated and the rooms are indeed pretty nice. The lobby is impressive and the hotel has a nice swimming pool. Yet there are serious language problems. I know this is China and that I cannot expect all staff to be fluent in English but if they advertise that your personal butler can take care of anything, you would expect that the Butlers would at least have a basic grasp of the English language. I had serious problems making myself understood; for instance I asked the Butler to get me the telephone number for the Cathay Pacific airline office in China; this turned out to be a major problem as they had never heard of Cathay Pacific and could not understand what it I needed; after a long time, the Concierge finally managed to get me a telephone number, which turned out to be the number for the Central Reservation office of Starwood Hotels in Asia. The St.Regis could be a great hotel if the staff was properly trained.

It is in a great part of Beijing and easy walk to Silk Alley (best market in town). Lots of nice restaurants. I have spent alot of time in China and highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location though rooms need renovating Great location and excellent service. However if you are particular about the rooms, this may be disappointing. The insides and furniture (decor) were old for a 5star hotel as was the bathroom.

<Content>Great hotel This was an expenses paid business trip, and it was a delight to stay at this wonderful hotel. The butler brought fruit daily, changed towels and made the room several times throughout the day, and the location is convenient for one of the Embassy districts. Subway is walkable down the street.

<Content>both the location and the service can't be beat After traveling throughout China for some time we wanted a comfortable, tranquil place for our final six days in Beijing -- and the St. Regis was perfect! The location is wonderful, close to Tien'anmen, but not smothered by the institutional dullness that surrounds the Square, central to other sites, and directly on the subway line. I understand the hotel is closing soon for renovations prior to next summer's Olympics and it can only get better. Service, staff, etc. were all first class -- eg. the excellent doorman saved us more than $50 by renegotiating the rate we'd arranged for a car and driver for a day. The only minor drawback was the absurd cost of laundry, the mini bar, and in-hotel dining (not unlike five-star hotels everywhere). Fortunately there are better options just outside the door. The hotel is located very close to many embassies and directly across the street is a small street filled with restaurants that cater to diplomats and ex-pats: an American diner, and Italian restaurant, etc. A number of these are surprisingly good. There's also a 7-11 and a Starbucks across the street, and an excellent massage parlour just a block south -- real massage, no funny business. I went the day after our five-hour trek along the Great Wall at Simatai/Badaling, and it completely rejuvenated me! The only hotel restaurant we ate in was the Celestial Court (the Chinese Restaurant) and the Peking Duck was wonderful, although the restaurant was surprisingly empty and quiet. The Silk Market is a five minute walk, and if you're looking for quiet respite step into Ritan Park just a block from the hotel's front door. It's like stepping into a 15th century Chinese watercolour! I cannot imagine a better location in Beijing. Unless the Starwood folks raise the rates to absurd levels after the Olympics I will definitely stay there again when in Beijing.

<Content>great rest after a long flight,this is THE hotel Travel agent got a great deal, included airport pick up, a massage, massive buffet breakfast. After the long flight from the US it was great to have someone meet you at the airport. Love the hotel atmosphere, not stuffy, looks very galmourous website. Jeans were o.k.! Most people were touring like us, dressed casually. Hotel desk arranged for day trips, reasonable and good guides. Plenty to see and do in the area. Don't think its too far out. Spa and pool are worth the trip down the hallway, hotel staff very nice at 3:am when I was hungry. Would go there again and highly recommend this hotel. No faults.

<Content>You know what you get I stayed there for 4 days and i would say that the staff are very friendly and that the service is as good as it can get in China today. The bar at the entrance is lovely and so is the live asian music they play. Although its a really classic hotel and with mainly older guests i really had a good experience but next time in Beijing i will try something more fresh with younger people.

<Content>Lovely hotel We stayed in a suite (check the special offers they may have on their website) with breakfast buffet included. The room was lovely and well equipped. The fitness center is state of the art. The butler service sounds more impressive than it is -- do I really need someone to draw my bath? But service with or without butler is excellent.There is absolutely nothing within walking distance of the hotel except the Friendship Store and the obligatory Starbucks and Haagen Dazs (two within walking distance of every five-star hotel we stayed in in China), but that is typical of most hotels in Beijing, which is spread out and not much of a walking city. (The Pennisula is one exception.) The Beijing St. Regis is not a memorable hotel, but it is a lovely place to stay in Beijing.

<Content>Beijing or bust Just returned from 4 night stay at the St RegisOverall, I would give the hotel a 3.5 star rating, out of 5. I thought our room was great as far as size goes, and the bathroom had large shower and soaker tub. Moreover, we always felt we were in a luxurious surroundings while at the hotelAs for the butler service, we called the night we arrived to have some ironing done but had to call repeatedly before someone came to our room. I suspect that this service is shared with other rooms. The downside of the hotel is the food - one restaurant, Danieli, is voted one of the best Italian restaurants in Beijing and I thought the food was not bad, for Beijing but pricey. The other food that was served, either at the buffet or in room service was pretty lousy -The gym is quite large but feels very retro, with 70s style cycles and elliptical machines.

<Content>Great service, less value Service was superb during our 6-day stay at the St. Regis, the concierge even offering to send a bellman to an all-night pharmacy to get some medication for one of us with the Beijing cough. The spread for our included breakfast was magnificent, and included surely more than 100 items (although this is mainly for the eyes of those of us who limit breakfast food to the mundane). The rooms were large and well furnished, as befits a hotel in this price range, but the overall value causes us to lower our rating a bit. Internet access was way overpriced, but we would consider any significant charge for such service excessive at $400 a night for the room. The dining on the main floor was likewise exorbitant in relation to prices outside. Dinner for $30-40 seems reasonable in the States, but when you can have a magnificent 8-dish meal for $2 or $3 in a local restaurant, the ambiance at St. Regis is costly. Having said that, this is a great hotel to which we would probably return.A warning to first time visitors to China: you will not believe the amount of pollution in the eastern third of the country. During our 22-day stay, visibility of one mile was unusual through the smog, and on 5 separate flights, we could never see the ground from the air after leaving the airports. On most days you could look directly at the sun at 10 in the morning, and you can forget seeing the stars at night. We suggest a trip in 2008 during the Olympic Games, during which we suspect the government will shut down all the polluting factories and power plants to impress the rest of the world.

<Content>A "happy" island Nice place where to stay: quiet, helpful staff, very comfortable rooms. Didn't like the food. Internet in the business center is far too expensive.

<Content>Outstanding. My wife and I travelled to Beijing for four nights in Feb 07. We had so far had an awful trip, I had forgotten some of my camera equipment at home, and our connecting flight from London out of Helsinki was delayed 4 hours, making our journey to Beijing 20 hours. There was an epic queue at immigration in Beijing airport, needless to say I was not in the mood, and at this point it would have taken a lot to impress me.Nevertheless I was impressed.The whole horror of the trip so far melted away when I saw the St Regis Hotel Representative (we had pre-arranged to be picked up by the hotel, the price was 500RMB (about 拢33), and was well worth it, might I add that even pre-booking via email was easy, the emails were quickly returned, and Michelle who was answering them was courteous, professional and wrote perfect English). Even though the flight had come in 4 hours late they had monitored the flight and were there to meet us.He was smartly dressed and carried a huge green and gold sign with the St Regis crest on it. He introduced himself and took our bags. We went out to the parking lot, where the driver had already brought the car to the elevators, and was waiting beside a spotless black Audi A6, trunk open to receive our luggage.The doors were opened either side for us, the representative said goodbye, and the driver took us back to the hotel. As we cruised down the highway, in piece and quiet, I thought to myself even if this had cost double it would have been worth it.We arrived and walked into the spacious white marble lobby, the decor was grand but very tasteful, the Interior designer must have been superb. Every piece of furniture was beautiful and expertly placed. Everything about the space oozed calmness and tranquillity, it was impeccable.Our room key was all prepared and we headed up to the 11th floor. Incidentally when you stay in a lot of quality hotels you notice the little things, for example at the St Regis, there was always an elevator waiting, doors open on the ground floor. And it is the elevator car that you would see first as you walked away from the front desk. Its a small thing, but the attention to detail while missed by most was not wasted on me, it show that someone really put thought into everything.Even the elevator was remarkable, decked out in dark hard-wood, and warmly lit.The room may have been small, but it was easily big enough. How big do you want it?, it wasn't at all cramped and had a king sized bed. The mattress was of extremely high quality, down filled duvet and pillows, and cotton linen of the highest quality. I would say Egyptian cotton of a 300 thread count. Obviously it was pristine.The bathroom was small but, again big enough, and a work of art, not a single place you looked was untouched by some detail. The toiletries were premium, and everything was covered, down to cotton buds, disposable razors, toothbrushes. The soap was excellent quality. Again even if you have all that stuff with you, you have to admire the attention to detail. There were more towels then 2 people could possibly feasibly use in one night, they again were excellent quality.The butler came to introduce himself after a few minutes, he would have unpacked our clothes and pressed up to 5 garments complementary, but we had already unpacked. The butler service was efficient, fast, and a nice touch, but we didn't have much need for him. He would do everything from shine your shoes to make the tea, if you wanted, but we only used him a couple of times for wake up calls and to bring fresh coffee (which was complementary).The front desk then called us to say that as we booked through expedia and there was some special going on, we could either have a 15 minute massage for each of us, everyday, or breakfast everyday free of charge. I instantly took the breakfast, and was glad of it.I was quite possibly the best hotel breakfast buffet ever, and I have stayed in some top, top hotels all over the world. There was everything you could possibly want to eat for breakfast. Everything from muesli to freshly cooked on demand lamb chops. I had lamb chops, steak and eggs everyday, and didn't need another meal till supper. The quality of the meat incidentally was superb (Australian I think). The bread and pastries were freshly baked and wonderful (even on Chinese new years day, again details), the coffee excellent, and the juices were freshly squeezed.The garden lounge was also a superb space, adorned with huge indoor palms. We had coffee there twice in the afternoon, which was served in bone china, with a solid silver coffee set. With this we had freshly baked cheesecake, which was served with warm with Coffee ice-cream (kept separately as not to melt), it was delightful.We ate only one supper in the hotel, in the main restaurant (there are 5), I had a rib-eye steak, and my wife had blackened sea bass. Both dishes were excellent.We went to the press bar one evening. The barman was very good. I always like to try the classic cocktails in order to gauge a barman, mixology is one of my hobbies and I know exactly what should go into the classics. The Pina Colada, Dry Martini and Capririnia were excellent, well presented and made with fresh high quality ingredients. The Singapore sling was not very good, sorry guys, visit raffles in Singapore and get the recipe, I know what the recipe is, and it does not contain sprite :(. Anyway on the whole the bar was good. An excellent selection of fine single malt scotches, and the finest cognacs, they even had a bottle of 'The Richard Hennessey', which retails at 拢1100 a bottle, god only knows what a glass of it costs, I knew not to ask. But I had a Maccallan 18yo which is one of my favourite single malts. On the whole the bar prices were very reasonable, especially on the cocktails, very reasonable compared to other 5 star hotels anyway, I didn't feel for a moment like I was being ripped off, which is usually path of the course in most top hotels, so full marks to St Regis, for keeping the bar bills down.I used the gym and pool once, and the facilities were excellent, probably the best I've used in a hotel, fully featured. The showers were great, with good pressure like in the rooms.My wife had a massage in the spa on the last day, she said the treatments were excellent. And compared well with other top spas we have been to.While she was in the spa, I was in the bowling alley, yes the bowling alley.It was empty, 8 beautifully maintained lanes, and I was the only bowler, HEAVEN!!I am no pro bowler by any stretch, but the house balls of which there was a wide range looked brand new,The lanes were the best I've bowled on, much better then the battered ones I use in London now and again.The Location of the hotel was excellent, walking distance to the subway, many restaurants and the silk market (in which you can buy anything). The overall location was very quiet, Its in Jianguomen near the US, UK, Thai and several other embassies. The subway (Jianguomen, which is an interchange for 2 lines), was about 3 short stops from the Forbidden City and Tiananmen square, about 1 stop from Beijing Rail Station (intercity), 2 from the temple of heaven (plus a walk), and I think 4 from the Lama temple. I liked the quiet and clean location, would suit the business traveller, the older traveller, and well basically the location is perfect for the sort of clientele the hotel would attract.When we left the hotel, I had booked another car to the airport for 500RMB, I had an early flight, so we had breakfast at about 6:30, left breakfast at 7:15 and was in the airport by 8:30. The check-out was the most expedient ever, all the bill was accurate, the car was ready outside, our bags from the room were in it. Job Done.All in all the St Regis hotel made the trip for me, I would recommend it to anyone. It was outstanding, as good as any hotel I've stayed in, and definitely the best city-based hotel I've stayed in. I will be looking out for St Regis on my other travels.

<Content>Great hotel, great location Was here for a couple of days in December. The hotel decor is... understated (by PRC standards anyway)! The staff are helpful, and the level of competence in English is about as much as I would expect in China - most of the staff can speak basic English and understand requests. I can understand why some of the other reviewers here might have issues with the general level of English of the staff here - do bear in mind that if they could speak English any more fluently, they would probably be working somewhere else!Rooms were spacious, clean, and decorated in a reasonably understated way. Spa is fantastic. Location is wonderful if you want peace and quiet - it's set back from a main road, in a quieter part of Beijing with no skyscrapers. I suppose I got lucky, because there wasn't any haze or visible air pollution in Beijing when I was there. Blue skies and sun make everything a little better!

<Content>Beware of "Deluxe" Room The St. Regis Hotel in Beijing is a beautiful property with an incredible gym and swimming pool. The service was friendly and efficient. The breakfast buffet was excellent, including cooked to order steaks and lamb chops.The butler service was excellent. However, just to clarify, there appears to be one butler per floor. The service was excellent, but somehow I had been under the mistaken impression (based upon wording in a review and the web site) that each room was serviced by an individual butler.My only complaint, but a fairly significant one, is that the deluxe rooms are tiny. It amazed me that a hotel of this caliber would even have rooms this small. To make matters worse, there was absolutely no drawer space for clothes and only enough closet space to hang two or three items. A better use of the limited available space could have provided both drawer space and addtional clothes hanging room.After one night in the small room, I asked to transfer to a larger room. This took a little effort (I was initially told no larger rooms were available). Once I moved to a larger room, my stay was a very positive experience.

<Content>Lovely hotel, lived up to its Brand name I stayed at the St Regis in Beijing for 4 nights and enjoyed it very much. The interior of the hotel was lovely and the rooms very stately and pretty. Having stayed at a St Regis hotel previously, I had expectations, and the one in Beijing did not disappoint. The check-in was a breeze which is always good after a long flight. The butler service is excellent, though sometimes I would prefer to make my own coffee in the room (not available) than to have to call on these guys each time. I drink a lot of coffee! The staff were always polite and helpful, from those at the front desk, the lobby lounge to the doormen; they were most friendly.Unfortunately I did not have time to check out the spa at the hotel but I was told it's one of the best in Beijing, so I'll definitely do that when I visit next time.

<Content>Nice Choice This was my last hotel after 3 weeks in China and I found it to be very comfortable. My room was nicely appointed and a good size. I especially liked the bathroom with separate tub and shower--and very clean. The valet concept is OK, but I always had to leave a message and wait for a call back. I needed some pressing done quickly before going out to dinner and although they said it was no problem (they had one hour) it took longer than promised and I had to call to get my clothes returned. The facilities are amazing as the hotel shares with the condominiums that are on the same property. They even have a handball court and bowling alley. But it is rather a hike to get there. Also the business center is in the condo area and inconvenient to use if you are trying to stop by on your way out. Basically a nicely appointed hotel that offers deluxe western amenities, but I do not know if it is the best hotel in Beijing.

<Content>Great time at St. Regis, We visited China for 1 month and stayed at St. Regis for 12 days for two visits in August  Sept/06, the rest of time we travelled to other part of China and we stayed at 5* hotels as well but there are nothing comparable to St. R. Overall we loved to stay at St. Regis, it is very clean, quiet, relaxful, fresh fruit every day, most of the staffs are polite and the suite is roomy. We stayed on 8th floor  12th flr second time. Their deluxe suite is lovely w/setting of sofa and office, etc..... Their bed is extremely comfortable. We would definately come back if their rate is a little bit higher than other hotel in the same class. We didn't get a chance to visit their gym since we were too busy. Their butler service is very fast. We travelled twice a year and I never wrote a review but I saw some negative experience so I thought I would shared mine (I was lucky, I guess!!). We had awfull experiences during the trips with other hotels, some of the front desk staff at other hotels had bad attitute, they giggled and no eyes contact when we talked to them.

<Content>Satisfactory stay in a lovely hotel Our stay was excellent because we were upgraded to a suite. The suite was one of the best-designed I have experienced and I would highly recommend one. Wonderful bath; huge walk-in closet with room for two large suitcases. There was good soundproofing so the soccer guy could watch World Cup while I slept. The beds were also heavenly.The comments in the other reviews about the staff ring true. We did have some very favorable contacts, but it was uneven. For example, when we called one of the restaurants to ask when they closed we were told to call the front desk. When we called the front desk we were told to call our butler. When we called our butler he said he was too busy to answer questions and we should call the restaurant. The food was excellent and provided a good mix of choices. They wil also put ice in drinks with no argument. The St. Regis was lovely but completely unChinese in decor. I have mixed feelings but really, really liked the suite.

<Content>not bad but not in love with this hotel this was my second time at this hotel, both times the rooms are ok, service is not badfor this time around, came in the hotel and realized there were yellow stains/streaks on the toilet seat, they were easily wiped off using a wet towel but really not expected at a St. Regis hotelnot in love with the butler concept either, would really prefer having a regular mini bar (there's nothing except peanuts, potato chips, and water, and 1 1/2 bottle of wine in the room), guess the idea is that you're suppose to call the butler, which I did, and to give the butler credit, have to say my glass of wine came very quicklyfood here both in terms of room service and in the hotel are not bad, last time I tried their Chinese restaurant and this time tried their Japanese restaurant, both were quite goodhave to really check out some other hotels in Beijing to say whether this place is nice or not, stayed at the Intercontinental in Beijing before and had to move rooms coz the first room had an odor issue, hate to say that PRC hotel rooms are just lower standard coz places like the Grand Hyatt in Shanghai are just fine.

<Content>Top Class I read some previous reviews with trepidation before traveling to China to stay at the St Regis. I have stayed at St Regis, Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental hotels as well as the usual Starwood and Marriott on many occasions so I have an idea of the standard expected.I stayed 2 nights, departing December 15th, and I must say I did not recognise the reviews of a tired hotel in need of refurbishment and suffering from poor service. I was in a Deluxe Diplomat room on the 8th floor, which has the butler service. The room had a very comfortable bed, a useful work area with broadband access, a nice sitting area and a comfortable bathroom with separate shower and plentiful towels and amenities. The butler service is a nice touch although I did not use it at all after the initial introduction. The public areas in the hotel were well presented, clean, bright and pleasant. The informal restaurant used for breakfast offered a pretty impressive choice of western and Asian food and the service I received on several trips was very professional and helpful. Danieli's, the more formal Italian restaurant upstairs was also great for dinner one evening. I was also pleasantly surprised with the good provision of non-smoking areas in the restaurants and lounge bar, which I did not expect. In addition, almost all of the staff speak good English and were helpful and polite. Reviewers who complained of poor service and unfriendliness must have had an unusual experience or set an exceptional standard for these qualities.I would not hesitate to recommend the St Regis for a business or personal trip.
