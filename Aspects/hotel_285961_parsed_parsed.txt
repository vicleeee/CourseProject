<Content>Highly highly recommended!! What a fantastic little place, really unique and stands out from the crowd. I stayed for three nights this past week and have only positive comments about the Weber.The room was very spacious and everything was in perfect condition. The flat screen TV and free wireless internet access were a real bonus.The small fridge was stocked with prepackaged ham, turkey, and cheese, as well as butter, jam, and nutela. In the morning they would leave fresh-baked breads and croissants at around 9AM. Since I had to depart at 8AM for my meeting, they left bread at night, but did not include croissants. While they forgot to leave the bread one night, it was no big deal as there was plenty of left-over bread from the morning before.The bathroom amenities were from Rituals (shampoo, moisturizing cream, body wash/gel) and the towels were thick enough and new looking. There was no convenient place to leave the soap or shampoo at arm level, so had to leave both on the floor; obviously just a slight inconvenience.Along that line, the stairs are very steep and I was in room 5, on the 3rd floor. If I had a really large or heavy suitcase, it would not have been fun to head up or down with the suitcase. Certainly if you are a wheelchair user or have trouble walking this is the last place for you.Room 5 was on the opposite side of the Weber bar which is open to 4AM. I could very faintly hear the music on Wednesday (I stayed Monday and Tuesday as well) and it did not bother me at all; I'm a light sleeper.Highly recommend it; I paid EUR95 the first night, E80 the following two nights (plus 5% tax). A real bargain price and surely they could charge double during summer.The location by the Leidesplein was perfect since several tram lines stop there.

<Content>All positive but at a price Stayed 3 nights for my husbands birthday. We've been to Amsterdam on several occasions and have yet to find a hotel that we would want to return to. The city is wonderful, romantic and fun. The Weber is located on a busy road but we requested a high room at the back side which we got and so we had no problem with noise, I wouldn't like to stay at the front.The room was large (unusually so for the dam) clean, modern (really nice lights), nice bathroom and toiletries and had a fridge stocked each day, breakfast was ideal for us. I guess my only negative is the price as it's more a serviced apartment block than a hotel and you are completely left on your own. This suits us fine, but we weren't even told how to operate the coffee machine so service wasn't great. 150 euros a night is expensive (especially with the strength of the pound at the moment), so I guess a few extra touches would have been nice. The towels aren't great, and perhaps a beer in the fridge would have been a nice touch as no hotel bar or mini bar.I would have no hesitation at staying here again, but feel the price should be nearer the 100 euro mark.Plus if stairs are a problem, stay elsewhere!My hunt for the perfect hotel in the perfect city continues, does that mean I have to go again.... gutted!

<Content>Amazing Place! Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on holiday and I am extremely fussy! Amazing value for money, amazing and chic location, friendly service and you cant hear the noise at all (and we were on the 2nd floor just above the bar). Only regret I have is that I didnt extend my stay! We will be back for sure.

<Content>perfect Bolthole I stayed here with a friend of mine for a short weekend away. The reviews on Tripadvisor were favorable and bang on the mark. It's location is right around the corner from the Leidsplein and just a short 10 min tram ride from Central Station (Tram 1,3 or 5 - Pay on the tram).To get in you have to ring the buzzer on arrival and climb the stairs (How Steep!!) to reception. We were a little put out that the girl on the desk had just given our room away but another was arranged without fuss. Maybe worth an e-mail the day before to confirm your arrival time!!The room was a good size - large by Amsterdam standards and although we booked a twin room, we got a double - I guess because we had the wrong room. However the beds were parted and made up to a twin without fuss. We were at the back of the hotel on the 3rd floor - less noisy and with views over a canal and other peoples apartments. Earplugs were provided as others have complained about the noise but being at the back we bearly heard a thing. The two huge windows and high ceiling lent the room an airy feel and coupled with the wooden flooring and cool prints made you feel like you were indeed in a quality, boutique establishment. The huge LCD TV had BBC1/CNN  Discovery along with the usual EuroSat stuff and the fridge and coffee machine were as mentioned in other reviews. Loved it. Coffee was good and fridge filled daily with Ham, salami, cheese, pate, yoghurt and OJ. Fresh bread arrived each morning and was more than ample for the two of us. The bathroom was very nice too with wetroom shower and large vanity.The next time I come I'll be staying here again - it's popular for a good reason so be sure to book early. If bar noise bothers you ask for a room on the 3rd + floor at the back. Lots of people outside at the front chatting till all hours.. One other note - I left my iPOD lead in the room which was posted back to me without fuss - Many Thanks Hotel Weber !!

<Content>Loved this hotel We loved this hotel - don't go there if you like a corporate, modern place. it is very quirky - steep steps not for the infirm.We were in Room 2 which was directly above the bar and yes I used the earplugs! The room was spacious with a great wet room. The bed was huge and very comfortable. I really appreciated the chance to make a cup of tea or coffee. The fresh bread, croissants etc were delivered about 8 I think. You could not pick a better area to stay in - Van Gogh museum was about a 5 minute walk.The Manager was very helpful - booked us tables etc.Would definitely stay there again when we return to Amsterdam.

<Content>Who plays basketball at 4am! I stayed here with my boyfriend for 1 night. When we arrived at 2pm the room was not ready so we went for a quick walk. The stairs where amazingly steep, you literally had to walk with you feet sideways up them. We stayed in room 2, the room was modern and clean, the animal skull above the bed was a bit scary, I was a bit worried that there were no ear plugs next to the bed as mentioned in previous reviews, but as it was Wednesday thought nothing of it, how noisy could it be?We went out around 8pm and the bar below the hotel was dead so we thought we were safe. Arrived back at half 11 to very crowded street, bikes everywhere. My boyfriend passed out so was unable to hear the noise of the music and drone of bass, by 2 am it was unbearable and I was unable to sleep, longing for 4am when it would stop. Come 4am someone decided that this was a good time to play basketball in a small courtyard just behind the hotel, the noise was worse them the music from the bar. Although the hotel was nice and the rate reasonable, I would not stay here again because of the noise levels.

<Content>nice but noisy this is a very nice small hotel with friendly staff,but be warned that is on a main road and there are 2 bars nearby(1 is directly underneath the hotel) and they dont shut till 4am!! so if you want a good nights sleep DO NOT stay here.i realized something must be wrong when i went in and found ear plugs next to my bed. On the plus size the rooms are clean and spacous by amsterdam standards and your in the heart of the city with museums and awesome shopping streets nearby.overall well worth a stay if you sleep well,if your a light sleeper DO NOT STAY HERE.

<Content>Location..Quality..Perfect really Excellent hotel.. Stayed in Room 4 - spacious, cute little balcony, spotless clean, comfortable beds and cosily decorated. Location is fantastic.. at a beautiful square, a side-canal view, walking distance to van gogh museum and shopping district.. flower market etc etc.. tram stop around the corner. Just a perfect little hotel.. There is a gret bar downstairs but the windows have double glass so you dont hear much once you close the windows. Breakfast is a different concept.. There are cold meats, cheese, milk, yogurt, butter, jam,orange juice etc etc in the fridge cornflakes, and you get a basket with fresh bread delivered every morning. and you can enjoy your breakfast in the balcony.. Room also has a tea kettle and a nespresso coffee maker. The best part was it was all spotlessly clean! You cannot go wrong with this one.

<Content>Weber is were the heart is I have just arrived from a 3 night stay in Amsterdam were I was accommodated in Hotel Weber. It was an extremely pleasant experience and I definitely became a fan of the interesting accommodation concept of this hotel: make yourself at home. FROM AND TO SCHIPOL: From Schipol the cheapest and very easy way is just catch the train to central station (tickets are in the luggage rooms, you may do it while you wait for your luggage) and from Central Station the Tram 1-2-5 go to the corner of Marnikstraat at Leidsplein and from there is a 1 minute walk to the door of the hotel. LOCATION: The location is excellent, within the cool night district of Leidsplein were small trendy design bars are populated mostly with 20+ (year old) customers; the hotel itself sits above the Weber bar were the decoration concept one can find in the rooms is extended to the next level. In spite the location within this known night-life district the neighbourhood is very quiet and depending on your room, if you open the windows in the most busy nights you may perhaps hear some noise but that really didn鈥檛 disturbed us; they have disposable ear-plugs on the night-stand in case it gets to bother you. For who wants to visit the city the location is no less then excellent since it is within the Southern Canal Belt, from where you do your errands around the city heart by foot (or bike or boat if you will) and get everywhere in a 10 minute walking distance. STAFF: People are not always in the reception but from your room you can dial and the calls are redirected to the staff mobile phone which is usually 5 minute away and happy to help you. Cards for the rooms and main door are given and because breakfast are eaten in our room you likely go by days without seeing no other guests or staff. It is basically like being in an apartment but rooms are daily cleaned and refreshed and always spotless.THE HOTEL AND ROOMS: As I read in Lonely Planet, once you accepted you are going to stay in a small room for a lot of money you are ready to stay in Amsterdam, rooms are small and often even cramped. These were very spacious for what I could understand. Each room is different! They are plain but stylishly decorated in a minimal style with some oriental / ethnic and baroque notes. Loved it! The bathroom has a curtain shower and no stand, is just the plain floor. Hygiene products are, as advertised in hotel website from Rituals Home; they have hairdryer. At least our room had a small balcony with 2 chairs where after firmly closing the door to avoid the smoke to enter the room (this is a smoke-fee hotel!) we鈥檇 sometimes enjoy a cigarette; otherwise there is a retractable wooden bench in the street at the window of the bar were you can have your morning coffee (see ahead for the coffee item) and smoke. The bed is very comfortable and rooms have security safes. In each room, a small sink with and an electric cup where you can make tea available also from Home Rituals. The best to me was the BREAKFAST concept. Under the sink there is a fridge where breakfast items are available in a tray and replenished each morning: milk, yoghurt, orange juice, cheese, sausage or nutella spread, confiture and honey, a few slices of cheese and ham. Additionally there is cereal and some waffle small cookies to go with the coffee I guess, they offer it everywhere in the city. A delicious fresh bread assortment is put at a stand in a basket outside your door each morning! I think the whole ideia is is great because at night I am always hungry and usually have to buy something to keep in my hotel room. In this case, because except for bread, breakfast is already there, I feasted myself and more than enough (+ bread) was still available for a copious breakfast in the morning. The COFEE: In Portugal, my home country, coffee means expresso and nothing else. It is good (as in strong, flavoured and well extracted from well calibrated machines in the great majority of places), cheap (0.40 鈥?1鈧? and available everywhere. Ducth espresso was available everywhere and was very good but most definitely not cheap (2.25 2-75鈧? even if within European standards. There is a Nespresso machine in each room with 4 daily doses available which for me was the final magic touch which lead me to fall in love with this charming little hotel. I could enjoy my espresso right after breakfast before beginning the day program, on the room, balcony or on the bench in the street looking at bikers passing by.Above all in this hotel you see in practice that stars mean little but that some standard facilities are available: concept and detail here is everything and less means more. Loved it.

<Content>Big rooms, near the night-life attractions Weber Hotel is a good surprise. Very well-located for those looking for fun - the best bars in town are alligned just on the side - rooms are big for European standards and well-decorated. Service is good-enough and the stairs (there's no elevator) can be scary if you have big suitcases. Very good deal, specially for young couples. It can be a little noisy at night due the bars around, but nothing that bothers too much.

Great clean-cut d茅cor, very very clean specious rooms, decent kitchenette. The manager is a nicest sweetest chap, very accommodating and helpful 鈥?what else can one wish for? Mmm鈥n elevator, perhaps. The stairs are seriously steep and narrow, but then again, it is rather a feature. Well and鈥he hot water is boiling hot, so make sure you turn the cold water on first.

<Content>good value for money Great value for money. Remember this is a 2 star hotel. Spacious rooms, light and clean. Nicely designed with ample bathrooms. There is a kitchenette with a small fridge, allowing you to stock some groceries and wine. In the morning the staff drops off fresh bread (the fridge was pre-stocked). There is a nespresso machine as well. All in all very good, the small staircase might be an issue when carrying a lot of luggage.

<Content>Poor value for money Booked this hotel after reading the reviews on this site. Have to say I was disappointed overall. This hotel is no longer a budget option, we stayed for three nights at 拢80 a night, but there is much better service to be had in amsterdam for that price. The room itself was quite nice, comfy bed,the location excellent and breakfast was ok. However the noise from the hotel bar (which is actually a nice spot) was awful and I resented the fact the hotel owners felt they could get around this by giving out ear plugs. Also woken up at eight o;clock by drilling in the room next door, whilst the servicing of the room each day was not what I would have expected, particularly the bathroom. Wouldn't chose this hotel again

<Content>Just Perfect fantastic little hotel, just round the corner from Leidseplein.For a small hotel in the centre of Amsterdam this is very reasonably priced, clean, welcoming and spacious.the bathroom is actually a wash room but it is so tastefully done. The bedroom was large for Amsterdam and the bed was very comfy.The breakfast is typically European, but with the firdge in your room you can buy and eat what you like in the morning. The espresso maker is a nice touch and the fresh bread in the morning is the icing on the cake.Would definately stay again if i go back to Amsterdam

<Content>A great hotel! We found this hotel on trip adviser, and what a find it was. We only stayed 2 nights in Amsterdam but had such a relaxing break we aim to go back next year and would definately stay at this hotel again. Located around the corner from the Leidesplein where you have plenty of bars and restaurants and only 2 minutes walk from the tram stop ( travelling from central Station take a left off the tram at leidesplein and the hotel is on the first street on the right). The only downside was the stairs, I know most of the reviews has a comment about the stairs but you do not realise how steep they are until you get there and even more so if your room is on the top floor like ours was. Once we had climbed the 50+ stairs our room had everything we needed, lovely bathroom/wetroom, excellent idea of breakfast in your room so you can get out of bed whenever you feel like and the most comfortable bed. I was a bit worried as this hotel was only 2 star, please do not let this put you off. We have stayed in lots of 4*  5* hotels but this has got to be one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in.

<Content>Great place to stay! A great base for a stay in Amsterdam. Definitely feels like having your own place to stay with the advantages of both a hotel (they come clean and make the bed etc, yay) with self catering. Location is good, just far enough away from the centre. It's a pleasant 15 minutes walk into De Dam, either along the canals or down a great shopping street. And round the corner from Leidesplein. I stayed in the first floor front room (with the balcony, which was great) and didn't have any problems with the noise from the bar others have mentioned after I used the earplugs. The only thing that I felt let the place down was, as someone else mentioned, the towels. I know it sounds petty but this place has been extensively refurbished, and is not a budget option anymore with the average price being around 100 euros a night but the towels are straight out of a hostel. Thin, cheap things that turn into rags as soon as they're damp. A shame.

<Content>My Favourite Hotel ever! What can I say, we loved everything about the Weber.The Weber is a small boutique hotel in the heart of Amsterdam and if you don't like climbing steep stairs then forget it. However, I thought this added to the charm of the place. We had the front room with the balcony (from which you could just see the canal) and it was lush! The room is so well decorated and very spacious. The bed was the comfiest hotel bed I've ever slept in and huge too! I loved the fact that breakfast was supplied everyday (fresh bread outside your door in the morning) so you could get up and eat at whatever time took your fancy. This was the most relaxing city break I've ever had - we stayed 4 nights so that's probably why! It was home from home.....The hotel manager was brilliant and very welcoming - don't be alarmed if you can't get into the hotel when you first arrive. Just pop into the bar next door and one of the bar persons will help you contact the manager. I definitely want to go back...soon!
