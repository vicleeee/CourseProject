<Content>Convenient location in Phoenix This was our first time at a Hilton Garden Inn and we stayed two nights and enjoyed the experience. All the staff were friendly and professional and the front desk people had good knowledge about places to eat nearby. We booked a king room which was quiet, and the d茅cor was nice, everything was clean and the Internet access was good. The made-to-order omelets at breakfast were great. The guest laundry was clean and well maintained.We鈥檇 been told these hotels are aimed at business travelers and we found this to be true. There were function rooms with company meetings taking place, but the guest rooms were at the back and we weren鈥檛 disturbed at all.We found it tricky to get to the hotel. The Phoenix light rail construction is not yet finished and some intersections are still closed. The building is part of a corporate square on Central Avenue and we drove by it, thinking we had the wrong street number because you can鈥檛 see the hotel from the main road. Guest parking was free, but in the central square carpark next door. This is OK as long as you unload and load your bags at the hotel entrance instead of parking first.We ate across the road at Fez 鈥?great food and atmosphere and reasonable prices. Some people said it was a bit noisy, but this is a popular Phoenix after-work meeting spot and we found the music and general liveliness OK. It was worth it for the food.

<Content>Glad I Only Stayed One Night My husband (Hilton Gold) and I stayed for one night in early September. This hotel was selected for the price ($55) and its proximity to the airport (NOTE: it is not that close--it is almost 7 miles and a 20 minute trip, and their shuttle will not take you to the airport). The hotel public areas are fine, though a little odd and chopped up. Our concern was with the room and the bed. We received an upgraded room, which was quite large, but we had to lug our cumbersome luggage through two sets of non-automatic double doors, past the swimming pool, in 100 degree heat, to a separate building. The room was on the second floor and had absolutely no view except for the roof, which raised some security issues, as someone could have entered our room through the window. A bigger problem was the bed--it was so soft, with no support, that any movement made by one person could be felt by the other. I complained to the desk clerk about it the next morning (having gotten no sleep) and all she could say was that the beds were new. A car is an absolutely necessity here. There is a parking lot across the street, and the hotel will give out parking passes to present to the attendant. Otherwise, there is not much to do here. We had breakfast in the buffet, which was of good quality, with the usual fare of fruit, hot foods, and cereals. Cost is $10.95, but it is free to Hilton Golds and Diamonds. They will do omelets.

<Content>Make sure you rent a car. Shuttle service not dependable I attended a convention in Phoenix and since I could not get hotel reservations downtown near the convention center, I contacted this hotel because it was recommended on the convention website. The description included the information that the hotel had a shuttle to the convention center. I contacted the hotel and before I made my reservation, I asked if their shuttlel ran regulaly to and from the convention center. They said yes so I booked a room.When I arrived, I inquired as to the shuttle schedule and they told me I had to make a reservation to get a ride. I needed to get to the site by 7:30 but the shuttle that held 6 people was completely booked by other 'conventioneers' and I couldn't get a reservation to leave the hotel unti 8:30! The shuttle service is not adequate nor is it flexible. One afternoon, the shuttle was not scheduled to operate because the driver had to unload a tourist bus.There's also not much shopping around the hotel so you need a car if you're going to stay here.The room was clean and had a microwave and small refrigerator and people who work here are generally helpful.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Great Value, Good Location This was my second stay at this particular HIlton GI, and I would say it is one of the nicest ones I have been in..... and I have been in a lot! Staff - Above and Beyond friendly, courteous, and helpfulRoom - Upgraded to a 2 room suite in second tower past pool. Room was nice and spacious. Small wetbar area. Couch and club chair. Nice king bed, very comfortable mattresses, nice linens, great pillows. Bathroom was nice, clean, well equipped and with above par soaps and shampoos. Pool Area - Very Nice in the center of the hotels towers, and looked to be clean and well maintained. A lot of people gathered there in the evenings. Restaurant - Nice, a little bit expensive, but not out of the ordinary for a hotel restaurant. Room service was offered. Parking - Yeah, as you have read by other reviews, its not the best. You basically park in a lot shared by a high rise office next to the hotel. plenty of spaces, so that is not an issue. It is not a long walk, but it is a walk, across a small access road in front of the office. BUT IT IS FREE, and for any hotel in any major downtown area, that is a rarity. I just paid 30.00 to park at the Hilton GI in New Orleans this week !! So its free, its ample, but its just a short walk away. Get over it. :-)Note - Lots of road construction going on in front of the hotel for the new trolley system phoenix is putting in, but it does not in any way effect the noise or the access to the hotel. just a small annoyance when driving to the hotel Will I stay here again. Absolutely! I believe I paid 90.00 or so, and it was well worth it.

<Content>quite nice I was attracted by the price which was $62. The fella on reception was so pleasant, As it was late when we arrived from the airport we purchased some convenience food from the parlour pantry in the lobby and heated it up in our microwave in the room. The beds were very comfortable and the room was lovely and quiet. Neutrogena products in the bathroom. You would definately need a car to stay here as a tourist.

<Content>Great Room - Great Price Stayed for one night - arrived late, left early.Had few expectations, as we'd booked an internet rate of $59.95 online several weeks ago. As a Hilton Gold, we were upgraded to one of the 'Cabana' rooms - very spacious, nice layout - located in the low-rise wing overlooking the pool (just above the water feature.)Our stay was on a Saturday night, the waitress told us the next morning at breakfast that only 20 guests were registered in the hotel that night (may be why it was so quiet there). We had the breakfast room to ourselves, not another person was there, or arrived during our meal. Breakfast buffet was typical hotel style, but the chef makes a great homemade (or so we were told) garlic salsa.The location is good, about 10 minutes from PHX, and 10 minutes from Hwy 17.For the rate we paid and the room we received, I really can't find a complaint about the place. Like most HGI's, the compact business centre had free internet and business equipment - very handy when you've forgotten to print something out (as I had).Would recommend the place, and would stay again.

<Content>Good and questionable Upon check in I was given a Double room. I reserved a King room but was told only a double was available ( Same price). That was ok since I assumed a double' meant two beds ( as indicated on their website) Well, My room was located behind the elevators with a double bed. That is one double size bed just larger than a twin. the bed was against the wall of the SMALLEST room I have ever stayed in other than a hostel in my college days. I admit the room was clean and nice. But, SMALL.After checking in I looked at the hotels website and they still listed King, and King Deluxe room available for the same night. I travel every week and try new hotels in the areas I travel, To find a nice hotel with a good work environment.As you can imagine I was not happy with the SMALL room but accepted it. I needed to get work done and on to my Clients. When I checked out I talked to the Manager Christine. She told me it was up to the the front desk clerk to assign me a room at THEIR discrestion. Since I was traveling alone they needed to give me a double to have a king available for other guests.The Manager said this is their policy and did not feel they need to reduce my rates for my (small) room.The Pro's: Great workout facility and snack pantry.MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT ROOM YOU ARE GIVEN PRIOR TO LEAVING THE FRONT DESK.This hotel is in a great location for driving to most areas of Phoenix.There is not very much in walking distance.

<Content>Great Big Room The property is wonderful for an extended stay. The room was large, comfortable and clean and the area is safe.I enjoyed my 5th floor room and view of the pool, and the staff was very friendly during my 10 night stay.I recommend this property for any business traveler who needs to save a few pennies and has a car. This property is not a resort; it is however a clean, comfortable and safe property that offers a great staff.

<Content>Single women travelers should avoid I stayed here for two nights on business recently. My biggest complaint as a single woman traveler is that there is no valet parking you have to park in a lot shared with the nearby offices--quite a ways away and kind of a scary walk at night.The rest is unimpressive as well. The hotel is of '60s vintage and though it has been redone, it feels tired and old. The linens are not great (they still have those terrible polyester floral bed spreads and synthetic blankets; sheets were see-through thin). Service also lackluster. Checking in, the front desk attendant was writing a note and left me standing there for several minutes while he finished. The maid service hadn't come around the next day by the time I got back from meetings at 3:00 p.m.I wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>Staff was the most accommodating I have ever come accross! I have so many good things to say about this hotel that I will just start at the beginning! My husband and I traveled from Nassau, Bahamas for a computer training course that was being held at the Hilton Garden Inn Midtown, Phoenix, Arizona in January 2007. We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel on Sunday afternoon. The check in was very pleasant and easy. We went to our room and unpacked and unwound after our long day of traveling. The room was very clean and had all the amenities we needed for our 4 night stay (which they replenished everyday). We had a very pleasant night sleep that night. The next morning we went to the gym that the hotel has access to. It was very nice because instead of it being a small 鈥渞oom鈥?with only a few pieces of equipment they have an arrangement with a local full service gym that is attached to the hotel. The people there were very pleasant and the facility was very clean (note: you have to present your ID as well as your room key and you have to have a room key for each person wishing to use the ). After our work out we went back to the room and got ready for the day. The bathroom amenities they give you are Neutrogena and are very nice. Shampoo, conditioner, lotion, mouthwash, sewing kit, soap and a shower cap. It is very nice quality stuff. My husband went to class and I went to the breakfast buffet there in the hotel. The food was very good and they had pretty much anything you could want for breakfast. I was very impressed. Over the course of the next few days we went to several of the area restaurants with in walking distance and one night we used the hotel鈥檚 shuttle service to take us to The Biltmore shopping area where we walked around a bit and then went to dinner. The shuttle service was very convenient and the driver was very friendly. He was a little late picking us up, but it was not that long. During our stay at the HGI we did not encounter one single rude or unfriendly person. My husband made a comment to one of the ladies who were setting out the refreshments for his computer course that he liked the tomato juice they had given them on the first day but he did not see it on the 2nd day. She informed him that it was put out on the first day by mistake, that they did not normally serve that. The next day when he went down to class there was tomato juice there again. Only this time it was not put out by mistake! The lady he had spoken to put it out there because he had stated that he liked it. To me, that is great customer service. On our last day my husband had his last day of class which was to last until 6:00pm. Our flight was not until midnight that night so I had a lot of time to kill. We asked at the front desk what time checkout was and they told us noon. Before we even had a chance to ask for a late check out she asked us what time our flight was and when we told her she arranged for us to have the room until 1:00. At 1:00 we had them hold our luggage for us. I parked myself in their very cozy lounge and plugged in my computer where I occupied myself for the rest of the day. There is a TV there in the lounge so I was able to keep myself entertained. Oh, and the free wireless internet access through out the hotel comes in very handy!Even though we had already checked out the hotel made reservations for us at the Ruth鈥檚 Chris Steakhouse for 7:15 that evening and also arranged for their free shuttle to drop us to dinner and pick us up again at 8:30 that night to bring us back to the hotel. They then made arrangements for a shuttle service to pick us up from the hotel and take us to the airport to catch our flight. Considering we had already checked out, this was way above and beyond our expectations. Just when we thought they could not get any nicer one of the front desk employees had overheard that our flight was not until midnight that night and offered for us to hang out in one of their rooms until we were ready to go the airport. WOW!! We declined the offer since we really only had a couple of hours before we were going to dinner and I was very comfortable in their lounge watching TV and writing this review on my computer. (yes, I鈥檓 still here in the lounge while I am writing this, I did not want to take any chances on forgetting anything when I went home!).Overall I have to say this is one of the best hotel stays I have ever experienced. I don鈥檛 know if or when we will ever be back in this area but if we ever are we will definitely stay here. There are a lot of hotels in the world who could learn quite a few things from the staff here. The things they did for us might have seemed like little things to them but they were huge to us. If you are considering staying here I highly recommend it. The only downside is that there is not very much to do or see with in walking distance. So if you do come and you want to explore Phoenix then I do recommend renting a car. But if you only want to go a few places then I recommend the shuttle service they offer (it will take you with in 5 miles of the hotel).

<Content>Attractive Rooms, Great Downtown Location, Very Friendly Staff Stayed at this hotel about one month ago. A very friendly check in by a congenial front desk person. Free cookies at check in. The room was very nicely furnished, very clean, very attractive. A/C a bit loud however. My only complaint about this place was that teenagers with their parent's keys were allowed to access the business center and caused a lot of disruption. This is the responsibility of the parents of course, however since the business center is directly across from the front desk the clerks might want to keep their eye on this situation. There are only a few restaurants adjacent to the area ( one block walk ) so either plan on driving elsewhere for dinner or eating at one of the few restaurants in the immediate area. Dining room in the hotel was open only for breakfast while I was there. All in all a clean, comfortable hotel, well located, with a very friendly staff.

<Content>Good value for the high season I stayed here primarilty for the $ 116 rate and to collect Honors points. The location is great for Phoenix and if you are familiar with the area, February is the highest of the high season so even the budget motels of the world are over $ 100 here. All I was looking for was a clean , quiet room in this area and the HGI turned out to be the right choice. This is a converted mid-rise hotel which for me offers what I like. Old fashioned quality construction, central HVAC and standard rooms that are somewhat larger than the newer designed ones. I had a cabana room, versus the tower, and I assume this was an upgrade for Diamond level Honors. At least I didnt have to take the elevator. The lobby was clean, modern and spacious. The room was very clean, had a microwave and fridge, and everything worked. Reading light was great and the web connect was wired in, which I need. Free too, as was the parking. Speaking of parking, this was a drawback for me. The lot is across a side street, so its quite a journey from it to the room. For someone in and out of the car all day, its a pain. Also for Sr Citizens who are possibly less mobile. And in summer it would be a dealbreaker for me in business attire. Of course in the summer you can stay anywhere in PHX just about for $ 116 !The Breakfast buffet was way above average and free for Honors members. All in all, a real value for the time of the year. Note: Its not in or near Scottsdale so this is not the place if your activities are centered there. Not a bad drive but still about 4-5 miles away by car.
