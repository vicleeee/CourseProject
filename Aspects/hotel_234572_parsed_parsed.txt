<Content>Great place, unflexible staff Lovely rooms, great location but the staff was a bit unflexible as we had to check out at 12.00h not even 3 minutes later (the hotel hall was empty so no big group waiting for rooms to be cleaned). I wasn't asking for an hour extra but a few minutes to finish packing.

<Content>highly recommended My husband and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary wkend. We were upgraded to a massive queen size bed, our room had a balcony looking out into a courtyard, and huge french doors. The window through to the bathroom that so many people have mentioned was quite unique!! we decided it was like a one way mirror you see in cop shows in an interrogation room. There is a venetian blind on it so it can be closed completely for privacy, or opened for questioning!!! The hotel is very comfortable, with lovely seating areas. The staff are superb, loads better than the staff all around the city, who we found a bit reluctant and surly. The hotel staff couldn't do enough for us. Breakfast, at 13 euro, is good but pricey. There's a small bakery, Dino Pan, two doors down. You can get gorgeous coffee and croissants there for about 2 euro, or there are other cafes within five mins walk as well. The hotel is in a lovely area, just ten mins walk through the Modernista district (Eixample) with the lovely architecture will take you to some great shopping areas. Or the metro stop Hospital Clinic is two blocks away (incidentally, the only bad food we had all wkend was in a restaurant at this metro stop called TAPASBAR, a glass fronted place - avoid at all costs). This hotel made a great base for our stay. Taxis are cheap, public transport is easy to access, and it's a quiet, relaxing home base. Can't recommend it enough.

<Content>Perfect Loved the decoration, room size even on basic rate is ok, really like the window between the room and bathroom. Perfect location. 1 min to Tube Line 5. Though it is still at a reasonable walking distance to the city center (Ramblas/Plaza Catalunya).I would book again in this hotel. Definitely.

<Content>Amazing value, fantastic room! Just stayed here with my husband for two nights and were so glad we chose the U232. We went for the top room which cost half as much as a standard room in many hotels off La Rambla. Location turned out to be good, actually, if you don't mind hopping on the Metro--only a block from the Hospital-Clinic Metro stop, which is just a few stops from the train station and also the Segrada Familia. The room (908) was absolutely fantastic. We loved the huge private balcony on a corner, with 180 degree views over the city. The bathroom was very spacious with a shower I would love to have in my house--two shower extensions, plus a rain shower. The hotel was stylish and very clean, with helpful staff, a business center with free internet access and a printer. Oh--and breakfast was really good as well...great coffee.

<Content>Excellent value, fantastic service Fantastic amenities and service at this place - easy access to the computers in the business lounge, we used the bar a few times and the service was great, the front desk staff were super helpful and helped out with maps and suggestions. The lobby is great for meeting people - a well-serviced bar and comfortable seats to wait for a friend.The rooms were excellent - very clean and comfortable - included a safe and robes, and even slippers, and the bathroom was nice and big and clean with plenty of space for a couple trying to get ready at the same time for a day's walking or a night out on the town! It was more luxurious than we expected and worth every penny.I left an item of clothing by accident in the room and didn't notice for a few days after I got home. I emailed the hotel, worried that i had seen the last of my favourite (and not cheap) piece of clothing and they followed up promptly, without drama, and they sent it to me safe and sound without issue, even though I was in a different country by then.They went the extra mile when they didn't have to and it pretty much summed up our experience when we stayed there. We found it easy to get around even though the hotel is not super central - the underground is only a few moments walk from the hotel and we used it every day to get to the sites we were visiting. So in effect, the location was really convenient as we would've had to pay a lot more for this standard of hotel if we wanted to stay in the centre of Barcelona. This was a real treat for tired travellers and well worth the stay.There's a great little tapas place not far from the hotel - gorgeous food but we recommend booking ahead if you want a table guaranteed. It's across from one of the train/undergound exits and had a few outdoor tables and small plants outside.. can't remember the name though unfortunately!

<Content>First rate accommodation Had a great stay in this hotel. It was a smart place to stay for my Dads 65th birthday. It was great value for a 3 star hotel...the rooms were very nicely furnished, the staff were courteous, the breakfast was good if you like a huge buffet and whilst it wasn't the most centrally located hotel, the nearby metro station meant it was easy to get around if you were prepared to use public transport. For an alternate breakfast, try out the bakery next to the garage (across the street). I would go back here on business but would try one of the sister hotels on my next tourist visit as i was impressed by the quality of the place.

<Content>Great Location - Awesome Value We booked 4 days at the U232 to watch Andorra Vs England in Barcelona.The hotel was absolutely superb! The staff were friendly and the rooms were fantastic. We didn't eat there so can't comment on the food - also the bar closed early.The TV didn't have any English speaking channels but that was a good thing!!I was happy to walk more or less everywhere. Most my friend preferred taxi's though. The tube was close by but you had to change at Diagonal for the main line and there was another short walk involved (I think the station was under renovation).The shower was excellent and it was nice to have a balcony as I smoke and my roommate didn't!Would recommend this to anyone - book early though!

<Content>Excellent hotel. Just returned from a 3 night stay at the U232 and it was wonderful, nothing to fault at all.The hotel is exactly as the website photos show. The lobby area is lovely and relaxing, especially with the ambient music playing. The decor is very clean cut and contemporary and the hotel was only refurbished last year so still has that new smell about it! The staff are very helpful and friendly. The rooms are spacious, spotless and you're guaranteed a good nights sleep in the huge comfy beds.Great location and close to the metro station. Check out an amazing tapas bar in walking distance called Cerveseria Catalonia for the best tapas in town. We had 3 glasses of red wine, 5 beers and all the tapas we could fit into 2.5 hours which cost around 50 euros, a bargain for the quality of the food.An excellent hotel, I would definitley go back.

<Author>DivedivaSwitzerland
<Content>Situation OK, inflexible staff for a four-star, our room was a bunker We were three women and stayed one night. The hotel is spotless and tastefully decorated. It's exactly as you can see on the website, so generally quite dark. The standard rooms are just big enough to walk through and only one person at a time can enter the bathroom. We booked (and paid!) for a 3-person bedroom but all that actually exists is a two bed room with a soft couch, thus not a proper third bed. We were told the three bed rooms only faced the back of the builiding, which was about a meter away from the adjacent builiding, therefore letting absolutely no light in. Almost made claustrophobics of us; we ended up nicknaming our room the Bunker. There was no discussing for a change of type room without charge, and after about 10 minutes of exchanges, no solution was offered nor any compensation. Still, having booked 5 months ahead, we got a rate of EUR 158, so a four star at that price is still a good deal. I would return but not for a triple room, so just make sure you don't get a rear-facing room!

<Content>Really excellent! I stayed at the U232 for 4 nights and we loved everything about it. The only thing we missed were English tv-channels, everything else is excellent. Our room was big and beautyifully furnished, and the staff was always very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is not included in the price but it was worth every penny of the 13 euros. The hotel is about 20 minutes from the Rambla on foot and there are loads of nice bars and restaurants in the area. We are definetely coming back!

<Content>Highly Recommended We have just returned from a wonderful three night stay in this hotel and would certainly return. There were four of us, three adults and one teenager. We found the staff very friendly and helpful. The breakfasts were lovely and plenty of choice. We had a late return flight home, but the hotel staff were very helpful and stored our suitcases away safe for us for the day after we had checked out, free of charge. There was toilet and washroom facilities for us to use before our flight home. They ordered us a taxi to the airport whilst we had a drink in the bar. The rooms were brilliant, we had two double, one at the front of the hotel overlooking comte d'urgell and one at the rear with a lovely balcony. Not as good a view at the back, but we were happy. Beds were large and very comfortable. Air conditioning was brilliant and we needed it because the temperature at night was 26 degrees. Bathrooms were very good one had a bath and shower and the other a shower which were lovely. All four of us remarked how nice the hotel was and we would recommend to friends and family.

<Content>Very nice, clean hotel with good price We stayed 3 days in in Barcelona U232 hotel with my wife between 3-6 August 2008. Hotel has very futuristic interior design. Rooms were clean, staff is friendly. There are many items with quality in the room like (shaving kit, liquid bath soap, shampoo etc.) Free wireless internet connection was enough fast. It's not in the heart of the city but hotel has a close underground station, it's not a big problem.

<Content>Very confortable and a good value The U232 is very well located, close to Avigunda Diagonal, one of the most important avenues in Barcelona.I have stayed many times there for business and personal trips.The rooms are very confortable, good beds (even if they are not the best) and very clean bathrooms.My only negative comment is the quality of the food in the room service, I asked for a club sandwich and it was not very good, compared with the club sandwich that you can get in any international chain hotel. I can not say anything regarding breakfast or dinner since I have not eaten there.Overall very good experience !!I will recommend the U232 for its quality and very good price.

<Content>Great service This was my first stay in Europe, but I was prepared with how small the hotel rooms would be as well as the potential issues with the bathroom (half glass shower door). The front desk staff were extremely amicable and helpful, especially when inquiring about toursites and the best ways to get there. Though we had some issues functioning the shower (though there was a full shower door, using the shower full blast caused the bathroom to flood - using the portable shower head fixed the issue), the staff responded to this repair right away. The complimentary internet service and relaxing library were unexpected, yet very appreciated amenities. The room was very modern looking and clean, though I would have appreciated some English channels on the TV. I would definitely stay at this location again, though note that it is located just north of the Eixample district, which is a little ways away from the downtown of Barcelona (near Las Ramblas).

<Content>Jolly good choice An excellent choice for a few days in Barcelona. What's with the picture on the tripadvisor webpage, though ? I don't know what it is, but this red thing is not the hotel. U232 is smart without being silly, efficient without being slick, friendly without being creepy, and good to retreat to when you need a break from the sightseeing. Gratifyingly huge bath; chilling air-con. Did not take breakfast there, but the bakery two blocks down the street was marvellous. Only hiccup is the ongoing work on the metro interchange between L3 and L5 at Diagonal station, which makes the journey to and from the town centre a little longer and more awkward than it will be when the work is done.

<Content>surprisingly good a girlfriend and i stayed 3 nights at the U232. we loved it. we got to our room and to our surprise, there were two bathrooms. that made our trip. we spent very little time in the room, but when we came back late at night, we retreated into our bathrooms, and then into our single beds. we thought this a very novel idea. there should be more of it! of course there is always a trade off, but as we were only sleeping in the room, we didn't mind that the window had no view, only into a inner space/courtyard. the air conditioning on the last night was warmish, but other nights it coped well. no complaints. the staff were friendly and very helpful. we didn't much like the 50 euro charge to extend to a late check out, so forwent that. the breakfasts were sensational - you could have almost anything, hot, cold, fruit, cereals, pastries, cheeses, meats, eggs. even peppermint tea. towels were good, sheets clean, decor very trendy and comfortable. this was exceptionally good value for money.

<Content>Very comfortable Smart, modern, stylish hotel with a very comfortable feel. Rooms are a good size and well appointed. bathroom / shower very good. Only complaints are that the wi-fi does not extend throughout the property. I had to go to the lobby to connect. Also, they do not have irons / ironing boards, which is a pain.. Otherwise, I would reccomend this hotel and this hotel chain.

<Content>Quiet relaxing hotel We stayed in a double room, at the back of the hotel, on the third floor. The room was kept clean and tidy, even folding our pyjamas up for us! The shower was fab, just wish I had one at home. The double bed was huge and very comfortable, there were plenty of pillows. There was a wide screen tele, fixed opposite the bed although of course it was nearly all in Spanish. My husband was happy though as there was loads of football on.Not a fantastic view but interesting to see how the Spanish live in appartments. Also very quiet, we rarely heard anyone. The hotel is located on a main street, near an up-market shopping area, there are plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. It's a short walk to the nearest metro station which is very easy to use and also cheap.It's about 30 minutes stiff walk to La Ramblas. We suggest you go on one of the open top touristic buses first as you then get discount vouchers for most of the tourist sights, also it gives you a good idea of the layout of the city and helps you decide what you want to see. Our favourites were Sagrada Familia and Park Guell.Only downsides of hotel were hair dryer not wired in properly and the room difficult to keep cool (it was only April).We would definitely think of using this hotel again.

<Content>Highly recommended Travel group was 3 instead of an intended 4. Had been avoiding booking a triple room due to an anticipated lack of space but having seen this hotel, the rates and the photos we took a chance. Really glad we did as the triple room was superb value and the photos were a true representation of the hotel. Hotel very conveniently placed, central location but slightly set back from the main shops, etc. which means you get a lot more for your money but still benefit from the convenient location. We had a large room with 2 bathrooms, plasma tv, free toiletries, etc. The staff were very friendly and efficient, although breakfast would have cost about 拢13 each. However, couple of local coffee shops where you can grab breakfast for a fraction of the price. Would definitely recommend and stay at this hotel again. I often take Spanish city breaks and this hotel was of an excellent standard.

<Content>5 Day Get Away we have just had a five day stay in this hotel u232 hotel barcelona, we have had an experience and wouldnt stay here again, i would rate this hotel as a *** three star, The check in was pleasant and we was sent to room 203 on the second floor, when we first arrived in the room we thought it was great we had 2 bathrooms and twin beds just what we expected apart from the 2 bathrooms, we later realised the 2nd bathroom was a disabled bathrooom and was much larger with enough space for a wheel chair. The bath has a large shower head for a full shower (minus a shower screen) and a hose also connected to taps for washing your hair in the bath, the only problem with this was, that we then relised both baths and sinks in both bathrooms have no plugs?? Where have they gone???The 1st bathroom was tiny, with not enough space to swing a cat, but had a large hairdryer built in and a shower with a glass shower screen. The only problem with this was the shower was either too hot or freezing cold to use. whats happened to temperature controll?? (ever heard of a thermostat)The air conditioning didint go down to any temperature below 19 degrees and the room was constantly hot the small window in the disabled bathroom opened into what is thought to be a boiler cupboard with no boiler just a big brick wall with an empty space.!.also one of the blinds was broken and wouldn麓t open up so we could open the window to let air into the room. also the radio sound system which plays music in the bathrooms and main room didnt work.The swimming pool is 50 metres away in which direction? anybodys guess???The sauna gym and steam room are all non existant! The staff were pleasant but didnt understand english too wellOverall we liked barcelona but wouldnt stay in this hotel again...

<Content>Great value for money I stayed in the U232 this week for 2 days with friends. The hotel is lovely. very trendy, we loved the library sitting room on the first floor. We were on the Arts Package and Shopping Package which were very reasonable and from when we arrived and had our complimentary Cava and drinks we loved our stay. Breakfast was included in the rate and was great - large choice of items and the staff were lovely and kept replenishing the buffet for us even after 11am when breakfast is supposed to finish. I have already recommended this hotel to friends and would be interested in trying the other NN hotels in Barcelona if they are as nice as U232.

<Content>nothing wrong with our breakfast We have just arrived back after an enjoyable three night stay at U232 booked through Easyjet. Can only say that it was an excellent stay in room 305. There are mixed reports on this website and I do wonder if it depends on your room number. Room - clean, large, Queen size bed, quiet and away from noise of Comte D'Urgell.Breakfast - good choice, plenty of it (better choice if you eat in dining area as opposed to room service)Staff - better English than my Spanish, helpful and knowledgeable and smart.Journey to hotel - A bit unfortunate that the only rude person during our three night stay was the Aerobus driver who made us leave the bus at Catalunya Placa when we should have insisted we stay on to Avenida Roma stop (another reviewer writes of this!)Metro - make use of it, cheap and easy to use!Theft - outside of hotel, keep a close eye on personal belongings.Would definitely return to this or one U232's sister hotels.

<Content>Avoid the breakfasts We have just returned from a 4 night break at this hotel in Barcelona and although we have no complaint about the quality of the room we would definately suggest avoiding the over priced breakfasts. Self service and the cooked never changes and is always luke warm. A suggestion to anyone using this as a tourist base do not travel into Catalunya Square to catch the tourist bus, if you head up the road towards Ave Diagonal (300 metres) there is a crossing point for the red and blue routes and tickets can be purchased on board and you can get off the bus at this point to return to the hotel at the end of the day.

<Content>Great if someone else is paying the bill! First of all, the hotel does not look like the photo advertised! It is very modern and the decor is first rate sleek.On the positive side, it is clean, modern and upscale. It has a lovely bar, sitting area, and it is in a fairly good location. Wireless internet worked fine for us in the lobby and our room. The staff spoke good English and were moderately helpful (We got better maps, directions and information elsewhere). The room was quiet and the breakfast was included and excellent! There's a very nice indoor/outdoor patisserie on the corner.On the negative side the motif of the hotel and rooms is dark which did not bother me too much, and we had an inner room with no view (in fact the shades did not open), which did bother me. The price was $210 Euros per night (plus taxes), and in my opinion overpriced and not a good value. I can say this as for the next two nights we moved to their sister hotel, Hotel Jazz, which I found a much better value, more conveniently located, and the staff more consistently helpful and speaking better English.

<Content>We like it very much! My husband  I stayed this hotel on 25-30 Dec 2007, in room 411. We like this hotel very much, very new furbished and clean. It is spacious with a very nice bath room as the photos shown. The decoration is home-feel and contemporary, not like the traditional hotel. We have a sweet stay there. The only dissatisfaction is the housekeeping forget to place back the towel on 26 Dec, we thought may be it is a parttime worker for Christmas Holiday. Transportation is easy in Barcelona and this hotel just at the station of Hospital Clicnic, a more residental area and less busy. The only drawback is when we asked the Aerobus driver (BUS from Barcelona Airport) where we get off for the hotel, he told us the wrong stop, the 2nd stop from airoprt - Catalanes across Urgell which made us walked 6 blocks more with the heavy luggages; the correct stop should be Roma across Urgell which only 4 blocks from the hotel. Be careful!cn112

<Content>Modern but dark A really modern hotel about 30 minutes walk to Ramblas, metro at the bottom of the street. Airport bus drops of at the corner of Ave Roma 5 minutes walk to hotel. We found the decor dark and the room next door was still to be fitted out , only noise came from the busy road Ave. Urgell, try to get a room away from it or you will not get any sleep. Have stayed in much better 4 star hotels

<Content>Cheap and Cheerful We stayed here during peak season, and at under 200 quid for 4 nights the price is fantastic for central Barcelona. Anywhere nearer to La Ramblas at that time of year costs an arm and a leg! It's a short walk to the tube station, a couple of stops and you are at La Ramblas. Tubes run til quite late, but after that taxis back to the hotel are reasonable.The room was nice - nice bed, good size bathroom and mini bar restocked every day (drinks not included) . Would definately stay here again next time.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the U232 for 4 nights in October on vacation. We had an early arrival but our room was ready. Upon request we were given a quiet room not facing Urgel road on a high floor. The room was indeed quiet and clean. It was well lit and of a good size. The bath was great with nice ammenities. the only small remark we had regarding the room was that the maid forgot to replenish the bath gel on some of the days but that was quickly fixed with one phone call. The hotel was recently renovated and the spa is not ready yet but we managed without it just fine. Breakfast was very good with a good selection of cold cuts and cheese, juices omlets, breads and pasteries. The location is central and very close to the Diagonal with ample shopping around. You'd have to take the metro to get to the Ramblas and the the Place Catalunia but the metro station is only 2 blocks away so its not bad at all. The staff were very receptive and attentive and responded to all our requests and queries. They all spoke very good English so we had no problems in communicating with them. Overall, we had a very good experience and would definitley return.

<Content>Clean and comfortable We stayed here for two days immedately following a Celebrity Cruise. The cruise line required us to leave the ship by 7:15 AM so we arrived by 7:30. Some hotels would be upset by an early arrival, but there was no problem checking in.One note, apprently the hotel recently changed names from Hotel Nunes (not sure of the old name) and two cab drivers did not know it by name.The Room was clean and spacious. The hotel had two computers with a printer in the lobby area, but also provided free Wi-Fi in the rooms.The property is 5 minutes walk to the double decker tourist bus that feeds the red and blue lines. So, although it is a way from the far more expensive la ramblas (sp), it is close to all public transportation that gets you there..I would recommend this hotel to someone who doesn't mind 30 minutes of public transport/ walking to get to the busy port areas where hotel rooms are 120.00 per night more for not as nice room.

<Content>Loved it! Loved it! Just a block or so from the Metro, which will quickly take you to the beach, sites or shopping. Great modern rooms. The best shower I've ever had in Europe! We liked the free internet and printing downstairs since we didn't bring a travel guide. Hotel staff were helpful when we asked for maps or where to get things. Supermarket right around the corner  restaurants nearby. Barcelona Turistic bus jump on point less than 5min walk away up by the Citibank. We booked for 1 night initially and stayed for 10 days instead of switching hotels. I just couldn't leave. About a 10 -15min walk home for us from the gay bars on Balmes. The only bad points was the card said they had a gym, but I guess they don't yet. I think room service was limited, but we didn't use their room service as we preferred to be outside of the hotel eating and drinking.WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!

<Content>Good location Booked the hotel at the last minute, as the apartment I had originally was crap!!, very nice hotel, rooms are clean, and everything is new as you would expect from a 4 star hotel, also its been recently been done up. I booked two rooms, 1 double and 1 triple. I was annoyed that double was two single beds, but it had a balcony and the view was good, so i kept it. The triple room had no view, and the air con was not powerful enough to cool the room down to the min of 19 celsius.(i like the cold!). the other rooms air con was excellent. Only issue I have with the hotel is being a 4 star, they had no tea making facility in the room, no iron and the bedside lamps did not work, some of the wall plugs in one room were exposed (i.e. no face plates), wired internet did not work, wireless internet was intermittent on the 7 and 8th floors.. for a 4 star hotel and the price, I did not expect these problems. Location wise its an excellent base to see barcelona, taxis a are cheap and you can get to any tourist site within 10 euros.. also, the metro was only one block away!! I would have given it a better rating if it was cheaper or if the facilities were a little bit better..

<Content>Great hotel Modern and Comfortable After checking into the Hotel the rooms are comfortable and good sized although i asked fo ra double bed they gave me a twin with a nice balcony. i kept it as it was noce having a view. They have good amenities and are currently building the Tenth floor to accomodate 4 more rooms and Gym sauna etc. Although there is a gym about 400metres up the road which you can use for 4 Euros i used it twice very good. Staff were friendly apart from one. The Showers are great beds comfortable. It is located 5 mins walk from the station which takes you straight into the main shopping areas and sights. Overall would stay there again had a great time recommended if you want to stay somewhere a bit more quiet. Also forgot to mention they have very high speed internet in the lobby and prices for drinks at the bar are quite good.

<Content>Average Nice room, possibly the best shower in Spain, but Hotel too far away from the centre to use as a base for a weekend away - 10 minute walk to any half decent tourist area. The hotel double booked our room and there was too much building work going on (dusty carpets, noise in the morning etc). Also, the view from the back is terrible.

<Content>Nice room - no restaurant or room service for food in the evening In my view - if you book a 4 star (4 star on Easy Jet, Expedia and google - 3 star on Trip advisor) with a picture of a restaurant on the website, you expect there to be a place to eat or at least room service if you arrive late in the evening. The hotel rooms are fine, but the no restaurant bit really annoyed me.

<Content>OK, Maybe more Suitable for Business Travellers Barcelona is a wonderful city, and this hotel is not in a perfect location to visit it. OK , it's not bad as a distance but there is a EMS station nearby and some other buildings that makes you feel outside of the beatiful city. Some Gaudi attractions are close (I can say very close for the a city the size of Barcelona) and also there is a subway station nearby - from this point of view it's very convenient. We walked to the old city - it's not very bad. There are coffee shops in the area and restaurants - I didn't try those. The hotel has just been renovated so it's very clean and so on (air cond. very good). The choice of colors and furniture make it look kind of cold - a lot of dark colors, black marble and so on. The people from the reception didn't look too friendly or ready to help.

<Content>Excellent value, well located and clean (loved the Beetlejiuce decor...) We got a very good rate on the Navarro hotels chain site for an extended 7-day stay at the U232. We were apprehensive that we might get a windowless room, but we were fortunate to get a room with a view to the park in the front. The room was an excellent value, clean, modern and in a very good neighborhood (central but not noisy). Highly recommended. ...as to the decor, it was a little eclectic (unusual color combinations seem common in Barcelona).Gianni C

<Content>Extremely Good Hotel Having read a number of opinions, which were mostly positive i decided on booking this hotel based on some good feedback, and i was also swayed by a combination of a good price and location in the classy district of L鈥檈xiample (the extension) and during my one week stay i was delighted with my choice.I guess you never really know what to expect from a hotel but im pretty relaxed and open minded and i found the staff and employees of the hotel very pleasant, helpful and polite. Rooms were fairly spacious and comfortable, shower and bathroom was of a high standard and there was plenty of storage room with a wardrobe and drawers to use.Unfortunately i cant comment on food and drinks as i didnt take the option of eating at the hotel but the minibar had a good choice of drinks and the prices were quite reasonable.Upon checking out of the hotel, the staff were happy to store my cases in a secure area in lobby as my flight was late in the day and overall i was impressed and would definitely stay there in future.

<Content>Nice hotel but out of the centre of Barcelona We have just returned from a 4 night trip to Barcelona. We had booked the petit grand palace gardens ramblas (just off Ramblas) but due to the hotel being delayed with its opening we were moved to Nunez Urgell. It's a nice clean hotel but quite noisy. Our stay was for 4 nights, on the third and fourth morning of our stay we could hear really loud noise from building work going on next door!! It started at about 9am in the morning (!!!) and probably continued all day whilst we were out! Hotel is not within walking distance of Ramblas area but just a few blocks away from Diagonal area.Good points - Friendly, helpful staff, good breakfast and complimentary internet access in public bar lounge.Bad points - Very noisy in the morning, no restaurant (besides breakfast room), Quite far from Ramblas area.

<Content>Wonderful four days I was taken on a surprise birthday short break to Barcelona on the 19/01/2006. This is a little extra birthday present we give each other. Italia, my girlfriend had organised the trip back in September and got a very good deal with Expeadia.We flew into Barcelona in the early afternoon and caught the airport bus into the city centre. The Information Desk at the airport was very helpful with advice and maps etc. The Hotel Nunez Urgell was towards the Diagonal. It was 100% full but our reservation was secure. Although we had asked for a double bedded room we had a Twin room for the first night. The following day we were moved to the requested room. Our booking was room only basis so we eat outside the hotel for every meal. The reception was very helpful in suggesting where to go for dinner and local sights etc. The room was large with all the normal facilites, except for tea making equipment. We have had past experience of this so always carry our travel kettle with us. I must just mention an excellent restaurant we found, Trobador, on Enric Granados and Carrer de Paris. Very reasonably priced. We would stay at the Hotel Nunez Urgell again with no problems.........

<Content>good price but noisy rooms We got a great price on the room for a long weekend and the rooms are spacious and well furnished. But there was very poor noise insulation between the rooms - perhaps the wooden (instead of carpeted) floors made it worse but this is not a place for light sleepers. Breakfast was not included and was rather expensive (13euro each extra) so we made our own.For the price the hotel was ok, the location was quite good too and less than 1min walk to the nearest metro station.

<Content>definitely a business hotel Stayed in this hotel on 12th october 2004 for 4 nights. Definitely a business hotel for the spanish I think!! No effort made to speak english or even spanish, just no effort made towards tourists. All newspapers spanish. Very noisy at night with traffic. Too far from place de catyluna or rambles, you need to take a taxi and their are plenty off them. Again a word of warning taxis did not understand our pronunciation of this hotel and had to write it down, average taxi cost 4.5 euros to rambles. Wouldn't stay here again. would look for hotel in passeig de gracia nice area.

<Content>Nice place to stay A very good hotel, subway station at walking distance. The people at the reception were friendly and gave some good advices. The breakfast was simply excellent, although a little expensive. The rooms were quite small, but clean. Our balcony was bigger than the room itself with a nice view. We reccomend it.

<Content>Nice hotel, BUT ..... Breakfast is NOT included and costs Euro12. The Reception Staff vary GREATLY in their attitude to clients, some are wonderful, some are very offhand and unhelpful - shifts change and the best ones will appear sometime during your stay - stick with it. Mainly business clients, so some staff may not be so used to helping tourists? From Francisca Macia Square close to hotel you can get to Placa Catalunya and Bus Touristic or other open top bus will deliver you safely to all the top attractions. No balcony and windows opened onto enclosed and roofed in space (so no view and IMPOSSIBLE to get fresh air) where all downpipes unloaded, so if you open the windows each time toilets are flushed or showers in other rooms, used water pours down outside the windows of ALL rooms facing onto this area, not too bad, but sounds like heavy rain, so keep windows shut! Air con. good.
