<Content>Good for the Price! The personnel was very friendly and accommodating. We forgot to ask for a roll-away bed at check-in, but they sent one up to us in short order. It was probably ten minutes from the time we called to the time they brought it up, and a manager stopped by later to make sure it had been delivered.This was a good hotel for our purposes (my friends and I made the trip down to Miami to go to the Orange Bowl), and considering we were four college students on a budget, we felt like we got a good hotel for the price we paid.The bathroom had no fan, so it was very humid if someone took a shower, and our TV started to go on the fritz the second of the two nights we were there, but other than that, we had no major issues.

<Content>Loved the Hotel The room was very nice and clean...we were in front of the pool, so that was an extra good thing for us...we throughly enjoyed the hotel, the staff was nice and polite and checked us in with no problem. They also have security and cameras on site, so made us feel a little better, knowing that someone was there to watch over everyone. It is in a great location, because you have fast food restaruants, 3 to chose from so that was great within walking distance..I would definetly stay there again, very pleased with my whole experience...great job to the staff....a plus to the convience of the airport.....

<Content>No major problems Didn't find this motel too bad at all. We sort of stumbled upon this motel as we were looking for airport and getting hopelessly lost. Got a great walk in rate - eventually. I say eventually as the most unhelpful receptionist - Leida?? - could not say at 2.30 pm if she had any rooms available. Told us to come back at 3.00pm. Surely she would have an idea, and there was no need to be so abrupt and cold.The room was fine, clean, newly refurbished but unfortunately lacked a fridge, which is something we had come to expect on our trip. We ended up staying a second night, but our room was not serviced the second day. Not a major problem, but again unnecessary.There is WiFi, but would only work in lobby - maybe our block was too far to pick up signal.If this property could sort out their staff, it would greatly improve the guest experience here.

<Content>Not recommended This is a older hotel located in a unsafe area in Miami. The shuttle took over an hour to pick us up from airport. We were given a room near the back of the property, and noticed people just hanging around the rear of the property. The room smelled of mildew and the elevator barely worked.

<Content>not the best MIA LaQuinta I stayed here in February overnighting between flights. I wanted to try it because it was a little cheaper than the other two LaQuintas. There was one employee there, trying to check in a vanful of people, and it took over a half hour to check in. The room was clean enough, but didn't have the amenity basket that I have seen at the newer MIA LaQuintas. There are a couple restaurants next door in the shopping plaza that are safe to walk to. Otherwise, yes you are getting an older motel for the lower price. You do get what you pay for.

<Content>old and horrible I stayed at the La Quinta Inn Miami Airport because it was one of the cheapest hotels in the Miami Area ($85)! The lobby looked OK but was aging. When she gave me the room key, it was one of the old fashioned ones with holes in them. So me and my grandmother walked to our room, when we got in it looked ok but had a bad moldy smell and the bathroom was the oldest part, the tub had 3 power things and the thing where you put the toilet paper was missing and the toilet paper was on the floor, the mirror had rust stains on the edges, the carpet looked old and filthy, and the beds and pillows were rock hard. This motel is also in a very HIGH CRIME AREA and all we heard in the middle of the night were car alarms because people were breaking into cars at night. The pool is squared and was definitely built in the 50's!! I'm sorry but this hotel is a dump. DO NOT GO, TRUST ME

<Content>Scary This is an aging hotel, with years of wear and tear evident in everything from the bathroom floor to the carpet.I was staying at the La Quinta on business, having flown into MIA and working nearby. The location was convenient for me as I had stayed at a nearby hotel a few weeks prior.On checking in I was surprised to note that all rooms open to the outside. Not a major issue for me, but maybe a little unnerving to someone with security issues.The choices on cable were limited at best (no FNC...I hate it when Fox News Channel is censored). Bed sheets were well worn.I went to bed early and was awakened at 9:45 p.m. by someone opening my door with a key. This is one of those places where you have an actual key, not a key card. I yelled and the person went away very quickly. When I told the front desk what had happened, they said, Oh, I'm sorry. I'll check with housekeeping and see what is going on. I'm not the kind of person that needs groveling, but the apology was on the order of what I would expect if they had been a little late with an extra set of towels. I never did hear what happened, and I won't be returning.

<Content>Great Customer Service  This is a great hotel. The service was wonderful. I am from Miami and went for a friends wedding. The customer service we received was great, I can't say enough about how nice everyone was. The room was very clean and the area is a nice area for the price. It is pretty centrally located right off of the Palmetto Expressway. I would def. stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Nasty,Rude ,Dirty. I own a cruise agency in Pennsylvania. I had problems with this hotel from the begining. When I did arrive at this hotel with my passengers 65 of them we tried to check in. The front desk gave my guest keys to rooms where people were living or the keys would not work or the rooms were dirty, dirty beds trash on the floors when I went to the front desk about this I was told that house keeping left already they gave us sheets told us to make our own beds. This went on for 3 to 4 hrs back  forth. I went back to the front desk to complaine again because my clients were still coming to me that there keys wouldnt work they would get locked out of there rooms.The lady just looked like she didn't understand my concerns or even cared. I had a honeymoon couple standing there with me and she gave them sheets told them to make up there own room I am not kidden .Then she called the hotel manager on the phone who was at home who in return starting yelling at me on the phone telling me he was calling the police because the lady behind the counter said I had an open beer (wish he would of I would of taken a breathalizer then sued),the beer was given to me by on of my guest on my way down to the lobby for the 10th time. I took it in with me I was told no open beer in the lobby. I threw it in the lobby trash right away as soon as she said no open beers in lobby . Now I was being told I was drunk because I was upset. I was so upset I called the main number for La Quinta the lady on the phone was very nice was suprised how my group was being treated she called the hotel told them they can't threaten me and treat me that way. She would file a complaint She never did.When I did return home I called the hotel to talk about this and the manager started again on me having an open beer in the lobby. I will never use La Quinta again. They don't care they never contacted me to talk about it and I have called them dozens of times. that is why this review is late. BEWARE !! I have many wittness to this situation and letters to prove it.

<Content>A Good Stay We stayed at this hotel on the day before our cruise and on the day we returned. The rooms were clean and the staff was helpful. Some of the other reviews I have read about this place made it sound like a horror show. It is far from that! It isn't the Ritz Carlton but you aren't paying for the Ritz. The hotel has been recently renovated and you could tell the upgrades that have been made. The only real beef I have about the hotel is the location. You have to take a taxi everywhere; if you want to shop, a decent place to eat, sites to visit, but that wasn't why I choose this hotel. It is close to the airport and they pick you up and drop you off at Miami International. They have a courtesy phone at the airport and it was easy to get into contact once we arrived. The traffic in Miami is horrible, but they picked us up in a fairly timely fashion. The breakfast is a bit on the Spartan side, but enough to get you through 'til lunch. All in all, a very good experience.

<Content>this place is the pits First night, Saturday was okay......Sunday night we found that the bed was miserably uncomfortable. Come to find out that when they cleaned our room they had removed the mattress cover. Just a bare sheet between us and a very used mattress. They say the renovated. A paint job doesn't constitute renovations in my mind. My husband could not sit on the edge of the bed to put on clothes because of the obvious hole or low spot in the cheap mattress. Also, our bathroom stunk of mold and mildew. Our phone had a message light illuminated and although we had no messages, two calls to the front desk went without resolution. Apparently no one knew how to fix it so we had to put the phone on the floor and cover it with clothes for two nights to keep it from shining in our face.Returned late on Monday and found at 4 pm our room had not yet been cleaned. Filthy from being out in the everglades we were furious that we had to track someone down to get clean towels so we could take a shower and leave for dinner. While bathing we heard them come to clean the room but they were locked out for obvious reasons. We called the hotel mgmt and told them we'd be gone an hour for dinner and we expected someone to get up there and demanded our room be cleaned.Came back to find the bed made, no vacumming whatsoever, and 2 towels. No hand towels no wash clothes. and still no mattress cover. At this point we were furious and called the front desk demanding a mattress cover and wash clothes. We were called back a couple of minutes later by a woman who said that they didn't have any wash clothes, all of them had been stolen and they were on order. At this point I lost it......stealing towels I've heard of but not the washclothes. Within 10 minutes another employee showed up with towels, hand towels, and wash clothes. She also put a mattress pad on the bed.The next morning as we got up to leave we realized that our pocket size Nikon Digital camera was gone. We tore the room apart looking for it. In our furor I had mistakenly left it on the dresser when we left for dinner the previous night and called thenm for cleaning service. All of our Miami pictures were now gone. Fortunately I had been downloading all of our other 3 weeks of vacation onto my laptap which was hidden in the room.The front desk clerk reversed one night stay for our trouble. As I pointed out that doesn't do me any good regarding my camera.Only after I filed a complaint online with LA Quinta corp. (who never did respond) did I hear from the actual manager. He reversed the rest of the charges and when he heard I was seeking to find out if my travelers insurance would cover the loss of the camera he offered to pay any difference. Needless to say it didn't meet my homeowners deductible and travelers wouldn't cover it. I notified the manager via fax that I was going to have to bear the full cost of the camera and haven't heard a word since.The place is despicable and having been a long time fan of La Quinta I can say this one 3 day stay has soured me from ever staying at a LA Quinta Inn again.I wish I had known about Trip Advisor before this trip. Had I read the reviews I would have never stayed there in the first place.

<Content>Lots of service problems The problems started when I waited 35 minutes for a van from the airport. I told the receptionist I was waiting at Terminal E. Four phone calls later, I still hadn't found the van, even though it had allegedly been there for 10 minutes. I finally located him in front of Terminal D! It took him 14 min. to drive to the hotel, a rather long time for an airport hotel.Then, when I got to the hotel and asked about a ride back to the airport the next morning, I was told that the first van left at 6 AM. This could have been fairly tight for my 7:35 AM flight, and it would have been downright dangerous for any flight leaving before 7 AM. Seems that a property that bills itself as an airport hotel should have transportation to meet flights that leave as early as 6 AM.After leaving for my connecting flight, I soon realized that I had left a jacket and a belt in my room. I phoned the hotel and asked them to be on the lookout for them, and said that I would stop by on my return four days later to pick them up.Well, when I arrived four days later, the personnel at the desk had no knowledge of these items. I eventually got them to contact a supervisor, but this took 20 minutes! (Part of the delay was caused by a walkie-talkie whose battery was dead.) Meanwhile, people were waiting to be checked in. Some of them waited almost the whole 20 minutes. And one other guest was complaining about the lack of airport transportation before 6 AM. After all of this, they told me that they could not find my jacket, could not help me at all.Oh, with regard to the room, I have no major complaints. The floor of the bathtub was spongy, like there was an air pocket beneath it. Otherwise, the room was fine. But the service was not.

<Content>Love the clean and newly renovated place to stay! Using our AAA we got an excellent value and also the weekend specials offered by the La Quinta's website! This hotel should now be 3 stars as it is newly renovated- no more hairs in the bed or mildewy shower areas! New carpets, new everything so go enjoy this convienient airport location! Nice people at the front desk too! Only complaint walls can be a little thin at times as well as the bath towels, but it's that way in most all budget chain hotels...

<Content>Cannot understand all of the bad reviews I really don't understand the bad reviews of this hotel. Perhaps the hotel hadn't yet recovered from hurricane damage at the time the others stayed (one of the reviews alluded to something of the sort).We (me, wife and two toddler sons) stayed here for one night after a cross-country flight before heading to my parents' place on the Gulf Coast the next day. We had no problems at all with our room. It was nothing fancy (as you'd expect in this price range), but it was clean and at least as nice as I'd expect for the price, if not more so. We missed out on the continental breakfast, having slept in after being exhausted from the trip the day before (and, in my case, more particularly, from not having slept the night before). I was a little bummed because the lobby/dining area looked quite charming; I had been hoping to hang there for a while before we got on with our day (took in a Marlins game before driving across the state).We also had no problem with the front desk staff. In fact, far from being difficult or surly, I actually thought the front desk staff was noticeably more friendly and helpful than typical hotel front desk staff.The hotel is along a main thoroughfare and there are a number of fast food and low budget restaurants nearby. It's also, obviously, close to the airport, making it a convenient place to stay for purposes such as ours.I don't know if I'd want to spend a week here, but for a night or two, we found this hotel to be an above-average value.

<Content>A total dump... Shouldn't have a La Quinta sign outside I have been a loyal La Quinta patron because of its value for money. I always know that for $100 per night I will get a clean, decent room. NOT the case at Airport North. This place is a total dump. The dilapidaded building hasn't had any maintenance or upkeep in years. As soon as I checked into the room, I immediately called La Quinta's 1-800 number to complain and ask them to move me. They said that even if they could move me to another La Quinta (which they couldn't even look up, I'd have to drive over and see if I could get a room) I would pay for my room at both hotels since I had already checked in. The entire hotel reeks of old mildew. The bathroom in my room actually had two brown stains on the toilet seat, which I had to disgustingly wipe off (not saying it was poop, but it might have been). The neighborhood is dreadful and I generally felt unsafe even walking around there.Not only will I never stay at this hotel again, I will never stay at La Quinta again because of this awful experience. I can't believe they even dare put the La Quinta stamp on this place because it doesn't even beat your average run-down $49 motel. Absolutely awful.

<Content>disgusting This hotel was unbearable. Our first room was not clean - the bed had lots of hairs in it and a table was covered in spills. Clearly, it had not been cleaned. When we requested another room, we were moved to a room that had a large window that would not close or lock - meaning someone could easily get into our room at any time. Since we felt unsafe, we asked for another room. The third room was still not clean. The water from the tap was brown. The floor was not vacuumed. We stayed but I could not wait to leave. I will never stay at La Quinta again.

<Content>Filthy We booked this room because it was close to the airport  has wireless internet in all the rooms. The wireless internet worked well, but that's the only nice thing I can say about this place. The room was disgusting. There were used Q-tips behind the bed  under the table. The bathroom had someone else's hair all over the sink. I picked up the alarm clock to set it and a mysterious liquid that was underneath it dripped all over my hand  arm. The pillows reeked of cheap perfume, which made it difficult to sleep. The coffee maker was missing the coffee pot. There were people going in and out of rooms all night  making a lot of noise. The sheets had old stains on them  the room smelled like cat urine. We didn't get a do not disturb sign and the maid woke us up at 9am. Plus the area is not nice - there is a gun store rght next door. There are plenty of other places to stay near the MIA airport - don't stay here!!!

<Content>Good Value Hotel I stayed for two nights: with fees paid $62.00 on Hotwire per night. Very nice reception. Room was large and well laid out. Big breakfast included. Location is excellent. I lived very nearby in Miami Springs for sixteen years, so while the neighborhood doesn't look like much I know it is just airport industrial, and safe. On the same street two or three miles past nice office parks to the west are all sorts of great restaurants. Will return, in all likellihood.

<Content>Do NOT Recommend Got this room for $52 through Priceline. I am originally from Miami and my company is based in the direct area, so staying at this hotel was great as far as location is concerned...next to all the major expressways, close to food, entertainment, etc. Unfortunately, this is the best comment I can make about this hotel. They are still recovering (a yr later?) from hurricane Wilma and more than half the rooms are not in service. The rooms themselves were fine, standard rooms. We did detect a slight mildew smell due to the water leakage but could not see any signs of water damage. We could not get extra pillows the first night of our stay and had to beg the housekeeper for them the next day. Our room was not made up the next day, although we left the room before 1pm. When we complained, we were given extra towls. Next day I called the front desk AGAIN to make sure our room was made. When we came home that night, only the bed and the towels had been touched, nothing else. The garbage was piled up, the carpet had not been vacuumed, the mirror in the bathroom was gross, no toilet paper; in other words, only the bare minimum had been done. We complained again. The GM gave us a refund of two nights, which we are still waiting for from Priceline. Another problem was check in. The young lady assured us that there were no pay per view movies and would not need to swipe our credit card. When we got to the room and saw that there WERE movies, we tried to order and had to go to the front desk at 12 midnight to have our card swiped then. Last warning: there is a night club in the strip mall next door that provides a hangout for a lot of younger adults. I saw a lot of those patrons renting rooms as soon as they left the nightclub, if you know what I mean. They were using it as a motel; I saw most of these rooms being dis-occupied within a few hours after they had checked in. Not a great place to have your kids. Be warned.

<Content>Worst Hotel Experience I've Had All of the reviews posted so far give an accurate description of the less than impressive property (the pool / hot tub is the best part), and the indifferent, defensive staff that we were forced to deal with when, after returning from dinner, we discovered that our room had been broken into and many of our things stolen. The front desk staff was so unaccommodating and unresponsive that they made us feel as if the theft were our fault. Despite the fact that we filed an official report with the police, contacted La Quinta coprorate headquarters, and followed up with legal filings, we were not compensated for anything. I was surprised to learn that one of the previous customers receieved a voucher for a free night due to service complaints -- not only did we have to pay for our stay that night, we were not offered any alternative compensation. Not that a free night would have made any difference - we will never stay at a La Quinta property again.

<Content>If you enjoy the smell of Mildew...this is the place for you Well we got there pretty late at night after a flight from Toronto Canada. We took their shuttle from the airport to the hotel and I would say DO NOT EVER take their shuttle. The male driver flew down the roads hitting the gas and brake simultaneously and was cutting in and out of traffic. I thought I was going to die.So once we get to the place the front desk agent was very nice and informative. We walk to our room passing the pool and seeing leaves and other floating stuff in it. Honestly who knows when the last time it was cleaned?!? So we now enter the room and a strong musty mildewy smell hits us and almost makes us pass out. The room was very plain and had nothing special to it. The bathroom was great...clean to the eye and very spacious...just what four girlz need.So it's been 10 months since I'd seen my sister and mom and we wanted to go out and have some drinks as this trip was for my 21st birthday. Yeah it is the sketchiest neighbour hood EVER!!! We were told to go next door to this apparent club. If you're into clubs that have metal doors with no windows to see in then that is the place for you. There is nothing around this hotel.. no good food places..no pubs to relax in...NOTHING!!! So we ask the front desk agent where a nice pub is and she tells us about one and it was great but a ways away. The next morning my mother and I went to see what was for breakfast and it was nothing fancy by any means. Individually wrapped bagels and danishes with yogurt and milk. It was nice but definetly not worth what the room cost.If you are looking for a budget place and enjoy being scared to walk down the street late at night this is the place for you if not go elsewhere!!

<Content>Creepy - Last Resort Only We were trapped at the Miami airport and had to find a room late at night (11pm) to overnight in. We called the motel from the reservation board located in the baggage claim. The rate was outrageous at $125 a night but still much cheaper than several other hotels so I knew I might be in for a rough night. Though the motel claims to be only 1 mile from the airport what they really mean is they are 1 mile from the edge of airport property, being about as far away from the main terminal as possible while still able to make this claim. The cab ride is $14. When we pulled up the entryway light was flickering on and off revealing a passed out security guard laying on a baggage cart in front of a well-worn motel. The night clerk checked us in quickly and sent us to our room, which had a mildewy stench. The kind of smell that says you will wake up with a sore throat just from breathing the air. On the plus side, though I was expecting a nasty, dirty room the sheets were clean and the bathroom was fairly clean as well. The room is about as basic as they come. Nonetheless, this motel is located in an area that does not make one feel safe.I would not recommend staying at this motel unless you have no other option and want to be close to the airport.

<Content>Not as bad as these reviews say I read these reviews before we went and was ready for the worst. When I got there I wondered if I'd read the reviews for the right hotel. Sure enough I had! I found it very pleasant. Clean, well equipped, really nice breakfast. My only issues were that it was hard to find and the airplane noise (LaQuinta can't control that!!) We had a nice 5 day stay. No complaints.
