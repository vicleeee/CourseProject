<Content>A nice hotel in New Orleans The New Orleans tourism site offered 'Papa Noel' rates for many hotels over Christmas. We selected the Hampton Inn hotel as it was closest to our family and out of the crowded touristy French Quarter.It was a great choice! Lovely lobby area. An outdoor lap pool (too cold to use in Dec.) and open cocktail type area to congregate for breakfast or anytime. Free breakfast daily, and it was a full meal, not just bagels and coffee, and the menu changed daily. Great afternoon tea as well. Room was very new looking, and nice and clean. Hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. We appreciated the full time night watchman in the lobby at night, too, which made us feel very safe. The St Charles trolley car was just outside our door.The hotel is located halfway between touristy French Quarter and Tulane/Audobon Zoo area. We enjoyed our visit to New Orleans very much and the Hampton Inn made it a very comfortable and pleasant stay.

<Content>A good hotel in a good location I travel to New Orleans on business once a month or so. I like the personal feel of this hotel. The staff is very friendly and the lobby is a nice size...you don't feel overwhelmed. The lobby has a computer for surfing the web or you can do WiFi in your room which I connected to with no problems. The breakfast is decent and the afternoon cheese and crackers make a great pre dinner snack. My room is always clean. Great bed and pillows, Quiet, Fridge, microwave. My only complaint is the secure card swipe slot in the elevator is touchy.I won't comment on the price as I am not paying....but my rate was $131 per night. For food try the mexican place next door, Fat Harry's or Cannon's....all are good. Try the Bull Dog if you want an adventure or more local flavor.KS

<Content>Convenient and comfortable I stayed at the Hampton Inn Garden District for a week with my 86 year old mother and 3 daughters while we were visiting my sister. The rooms were a nice size, with a refrigerator and microwave. The beds are very comfortable. The cheese, fruit and tea reception in the late afternoon is a nice way to relax after a day of siteseeing, and if you'd like a drink to go with your cheese the Superior Grill 2 doors away makes a mean margarita to go. Parking is free, and the hotel is conveniently located. You can also jump on the streetcar (which stops across the street from the hotel) to get to the French Quarter or to Riverbend, where there are some great restaurants. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Rather Impressed! Stayed at this hotel for the BCS Championship Game weekend and enjoyed it! Staff was friendly, and the price was not bad for a busy weekend. Bed was comfortable and room was decent size. Bathroom was clean and always had plenty of hot water. However, the pipes are a bit noisy so if you are a light sleeper ask for an end room. Was a great hotel for a busy weekend!

<Content>Overpriced My daughter lives in New Orleans and I travel there frequently. This hotel is clean and in a quiet area. It is however, overpriced. You can find great hotels in the quarter for under $100 bucks. We paid $180.00 a night. The room had a very stale smell to it and only a shower no tub.

<Content>Excellent Choice for Business Traveler, Tourists A very nice hotel. Good amenities (ice tea and snacks in the afternoon, free breakfast in the morning, coffemaker, microwave, fridge in room). If you are a jogger, this is an excellent location - run down St. Charles for a few miles in the former trolley tracks or drive a few blocks to Audubon Park and run the loop there. Close to nice restaurants and a large Whole Foods on Magazine Street. A great value too. I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>A Great Choice! We've just returned from a delightful visit to New Orleans for my son's wedding. Staying at the Hampton Inn on St. Charles Avenue helped make it a pleasure from start to finish. The hotel itself is very attractive and clean with a charming outdoor pool and seating area. The staff were kind, helpful and very friendly. Our group, which included a child, enjoyed the many selections offered at breakfast and the afternoon tea. The parking area is free, safe, and just a few steps from the entrance. It was so convenient to many of this wonderful city's attractions, we very much hope to stay there again.

<Content>Great Experience...Could not be better. I stayed there for a week. The room was large and clean; it had a refrigerator; lots of TV channels, and free wireless connection. The breakfast was pretty good, and the cheese and crackers with tea in the afternoon was nice. My 4 year old grandaughter loved the pool, which was kept very clean. One of the best features is a free parking lot right behind the main back entrance to the hotel. It is safe and easy to use. The staff is really friendly. It is also convenient to getting to almost all of New Orleans by car...every thing is about 15 minutes away. I would stay there again and again. I was in NOLA for pleasure visiting my daughter and her family, but I travel in my work as a lawyer and spend many nights each year in hotels around the world. And this is one terrific hotel in a great, great city.

<Content>Highly recommend This hotel was simply wonderful. Designed to look old, but only about10 years old, the hotel was beautifully decorated and set a veryNew Orleans mood. The location is terrific. It does not have a Fitness Center or laundry, but we didn't care. Their breakfast servedthe best fruit we had at a Hampton, on a long trip. We had great service from two employees in particular: Manager Charlene Martinez was extremely helpful, and Rose, who was serving breakfast, was a joy! (Hi to you both!)New Orleans is still a great city, yet it's one in extreme pain. We were so glad to visit there, to spend our money in a place that desperately needs support from business and individuals. The French Quarter was great, as always. But we drove all around the surroundingareas, and the tragic effects of Katrina are evident everywhere. The devastation was so extensive it will take years to come back. Here's a place where we can really make a difference.

<Content>perfect for us!!! I rely heavily on reviews within this forum..so I thought I would add mine on the Hampton Inn in the Garden District. It was perfect for us...my daughter and I were traveling to Tulane and I was looking for accomadations between downtown and the school. Service and Hotel: The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. We arrived at about 10:30 for check in and they were not ready for us...but quickly found us a room. The room was clean enought...but the really great thing was how comfortable the bed was. It had 6 comfy useable pillows and a down comforter covered with a duvet...as most of us do not spend a lot of time in the room ..this great bed and hot shower were just perfect.It is about a 2 mile distance to Tulane which was perfect for a walk....Within the area is a Rite Aid to pick up incidentals , The Superior Grill which has great tex mex and huge magaritas, Columns is 2 blocks away with a great bar and really nice Sunday Brunch, Cannon's is just up the street...The Hampton Inn worked really well for mom and daughter wanting to see a little more than the french quarter...although we have done that too.T

<Content>OK only for quietness and location Generally clean though housekeeping was not thorough. Breakfast mediocre at best. Front desk gives incorrect advice/travel directions. Good aspects were the quiet area and the free internet access in the lobby. The quiet area part is important because much of the city is still in bad shape, and only 1 streetcar (trolley) line is up, and that's the one that goes along St Charles (line 12.) There is limited public transportation; you will wait quite a while for a bus. The hotel is in the Garden District, which is 2+ miles from the French Quarter and has the look and feel of a suburb with is mansions (these as far as I know are not open for public visits.) The area is very good though for mid-priced hip restaurants (Magazine Street, about 5 or so bad blocks away) and mid-priced shopping (antiques and boutique clothing stores.) The area between St Charles and Magazine is not good at all. Note: The French Quarter businesses (what is left of them) charge too much for their products, and the downtown are is largely rundown and tacky. So the Garden District is a good base, maybe another hotel should be chosen though.

<Content>Reliable, safe mid-$$$ option for Garden District I stayed here for a Tulane event (they generously paid for it, at $119 per night. That was probably a special/bulk rate so I don't know how that compares to rack rates.) It is a nice, consistent hotel, with great rooms and wonderful breakfast included, and free parking. The location would be great for Mardi Gras (right on the beginning of the parade route) or for anyone who wanted to stay in the Garden District/closer to Tulane than the Quarter. This place is definitely nicer than what you'll get for the same price downtown. The staff was very friendly and the entire stay was just pleasant; you got the feeling things were run very smoothly and efficiently. The room was very large and I would say this would be a good choice for those with children, or a car. There is a bus line currently running down St Charles Av to replace the streetcar (to which they are still repairing the damage from Katrina at least through this fall,) so you wouldn't NEED a car to get to the Quarter, but if you do have one, you'll get free, secure parking here which is hard to come by. I'm surprised it's only rated 2 stars. The only drawback, if any... it IS a chain hotel, so you won't get any quirky, historic New Orleans charm. on the flipside, I've stayed at plenty of hotels that DO offer that and I have found it to be more of a 'gamble.' Things were consistent and safe and pleasant here. Overall highly recommended, if it's in your price range.

<Content>Nice, relaxing visit We were in New Orleans for a wedding and enjoyed our stay at the Hampton Inn. The Garden District is a beautiful area, and the hotel is surrounded by tree-lined streets so you almost forget you are in a city! It is only a short cab ride to the French Quarter (street car was still not running) . The breakfast was plentiful and our room was clean and comfortable.

<Content>Accommodated Four Families with Eleven Children Graciously We were in New Orleans for a family reunion and wanted a place to stay not far from my Grandmother's house near Tulane. This hotel is on St. Charles Avenue, and suited our purposes well (to visit the French Quarter, or Tulane, however, you will need to drive or take a cab). Among our group we had rooms with King beds and a pullout sofa (feels more spacious during the day, but the pullout sofa is best for two small children or one larger person) as well as rooms with two doubles. The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. Continental breakfast (with a daily hot choice, such as the fixings for a breakfast sandwich) is included. In the late afternoon cheese and fruit are served, and coffee is available 24 hours. There is a small pool (we called it a half pool because it was only 6 or 8 feet wide, like a lap pool for one swimmer). It worked for our young swimmers, however, as it ranged from 3 to 4 feet deep. (As of August 21st, the pool was closed for resurfacing). There is no air conditioning in the halls on the room floors (not a big problem - just strange). The air conditioning in the rooms worked well. We had a great stay and felt welcomed, even though we were accompanied by lots of children. There seemed to be a number of people staying semi long-term (working for a while, or coming down every weekend to work on their houses).

<Content>Very nice This was the third time I've stayed at the hotel. It's a very convenient location for those with Tulane students plus there's ample free parking. I feel safe here when I travel by myself. They weren't busy so the rate for the whirlpool street view room was the same as the rate for the regular room. The room was huge for this type of hotel. King bed, walking space, console with tv on top, then spacious area with microwave/refrigerator, table with 4 chairs and sofa bed. The rooms have been upgraded. The new beds are great. Good pillows too. Bathroom was large enough for double sink and garden sized whirlpool tub. Room was clean but not spotless. Housekeeping needs to do a better job preventing the mold in the tub corners (a Tilex should have been used two days ago to prevent the mold as opposed to this is gross and needs a major bleach job). Breakfast is typical for this chain. Public areas are very nice.

<Content>Hampton Inn in Garden District very nice The Garden District is a bit ravaged by Katrina, but our stay was quite comfortable. The staff was quite helpful. Security was excellent. The breakfast was adequate and plentiful. It is a big plus that parking is included in the room rate. This hotel was very accommodating about our need for a late check-out. I appreciated the free computer and Internet access in the lobby.

<Content>Excellent Service and Friendly Staff We stayed at the Hampton Inn on Wednesday, July 6, 2005. We had to stay in New Orleans because my son had a doctor's appointment at the Children's Hospital the next morning. The manager gave us a discount on the room because we were going to the hospital. When we arrived they notified our parents (who were staying at the hotel also) that we had gotten there safe. They held the reservation for the next day because we did not know if he would need to go back on Friday. The entire staff was excellent, the evening crew as well as the morning crew, as well as the server for breakfast were all very nice. They wished us luck before we left that morning! (I thought that was a nice touch) The breakfast choices were excellent, there really was something for everyone. The rooms were very clean and well equipped, there was no cable but the hotel could not help that because of the tropical storm that was there earlier in the week. The shower was excellent, never ran out of hot water. Though we didn't get to enjoy the pool, the pool area looked very nice and were supplied with tables under a roof and towels for drying off. The whole stay at the Hampton was excellent and we will definitely return (hopefully this time for fun). Thanks for all the consideration!

<Content>Great Deal With the outrageous valet parking prices throughout NO, having free parking saves you an average of $20-25 a night. No parking fees here. The hotel is in a great location in front of the street car line, adubon park is down the road, Tulane U., etc.. The St. Charles location is one of the safest in the city compared to the quarter and CBD. There are more police uptown due to the large houses, street cars, private schools, and universities. You won't find the amenities at a marriot, but this is a Hampton inn, if you want to save money, this is a great deal in a great city.

<Content>One of the best in the Garden District This hotel is excellent because it actually has its own free, non-valet parking lot. You will be hard-pressed to find this feature in other hotels in the Garden District/French Quarter. It is also right next to the streetcar line which is very convenient for going to the Quarter. The building is clean and not old. There are higher-rated hotels which are far behind this one in modern conveniences. You also get a great breakfast and a decent evening snack. We have stayed here several times. We also have experienced several other New Orleans hotels and have not found any that are better than this one in terms of quality and convenience. It is worth the money.

<Content>Decent but nothing great I had read a lot of reviews about the Hampton Inn on St Charles Ave on this website and I think they overrate the place. The lobby was very nice, most of the staff were courteous and the breakfast was standard hampton inn breakfast - but why eat at the hotel when you are in NO? The rooms were average - bed was comfortable with nice linens and paing color was nice but couch was stained, saw some paint chips on the wall, bathroom need some repairs and towels were flimsy. The room also reeked of cleaning solution. The hotel is just outside the Garden Dist and close to a questionable neighborhood but conveniently located off the St Charles street car which is great. I never felt unsafe but noticed police around the hotel a bit - not sure if this is good or bad. Overall, I thought the property was fine, although not worth what they charge and not as good as other posts have suggested.

<Content>Great flexibility We stayed here in March 2004 and I would highly recommend the hotel for the rooms, staff, breakfast, free parking and location. As others have pointed out, this is a great place if you have your own car because you have the option of the St. Charles streetcar, using your own car, or walking in the Garden District.I suppose it is a matter of perspective, but I found driving and parking in New Orleans easy and cheap compared to downtown Toronto and we actually found it easier to take the car rather than wait for the streetcar if we were out late at night.

<Content>What a great place to stay, I booked this hotel based on the reviews that I had read.Never having been to N.O. before I wasn't familiar with the different areas. Now that I've been I am so glad we stayed in a hotel away from downtown. The trolley stops in front of the hotel  for $5.00 you can get a pass for the whole day that allows you on all Metro transportation. It's about a 5 minute ride from the Garden District to the downtown.I would say that this is the nicest Hampton Inn that I have stayed in.The room was clean, comfortable beds, friendly service staff, and a better than usual breakfast. There is also a good mexican restaurant two doors away. I would definately stay there again.

<Content>Great base for business or pleasure in New Orleans I have stayed here several times. With the exception of one rude front desk girl, the staff has always been helpful. It is too far away from the French Quarter to walk, but it is directly on the Street Car line. The street car ride is an experience in itself.The hotel is in a fantastic neighborhood, the Garden District, which is full of multi-million dollar houses. There is also a fairly good Mexican restaurant right next door once you get tired of Cajun seafood every night!

<Content>Nice Hotel. This hotel is very good value for money. The rooms are clean and well appointed. The breakfast is included in the price which is particularly good. The trolley stop is two steps from the hotel, which takes you to the French Quarter and Bourbon Street. There was building work going on next door, but this did not impact our enjoyment. There is a great Mexican restaurant next door. I recommend there Burgers!!! Yummy!!! While we were in New Orleans we took the boat from the French Quarter to the Zoo. There is very little to see on the river mostly industrial cargo bays. If you plan on visiting the Zoo I recommend taking the trolley from the hotel to the park and then get the free shuttle bus to the Zoo. The Zoo is Ok but I found it unsettling to see animals in captivation for our entertainment and enjoyment.Although this hotel is in the Garden district don鈥檛 be put off. The trolley service runs all night and is regular.

<Content>So Pleased We couldn't have been happier with this hotel. Room was clean and very nice, continental breakfast was fantastic (eggs, sausage, BG, toast, donuts, bagels, fruit, cereal, juice, coffee), front desk people were very pleasant. We stayed three nights and had a wonderful time in New Orleans and intend on going back in the spring. We will be staying at this hotel again as it is above the norm and worth the money.
