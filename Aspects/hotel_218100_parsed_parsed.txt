<Content>Very nice resort, especially the price I stayed at the Four Points for 4 nights and really enjoyed my stay. I room was not that big, but the service was great, and the hotel room was clean. I had a room on the 4th floor and had a pool-side view. The hotel staff were very accomodating and helpful. The location to the hotel was nice, a Barnes  Noble and Olive Garden are across the street. A mall with a movie theater is less than a mile away, (although I thought the mall was a bit of a dud). The one thing I wish the hotel had was a continental breakfast. There was a room-service breakfast option, but I never tried it. I did order their room-service burger and fries one evening, and I thought it was quite good. And the staff that brought it up to my room were very friendly and personable. Overall, I thought this was a lovely hotel.

<Content>Greatest staff anywhere We first stayed here by accident in May, '08--the Sheraton across the street was full. What we found was the most attentive and gracious staff of any hotel we've ever stayed at. Now when we have to go to Phoenix we always stay here. Everyone--from Sam behind the desk, to Amparo in Housekeeping to Jose on the grounds to Carol in the gift shop and Sandy and Andy in the restaurant, treats us like family. The attached restaurant --Copper Creek--is a true find--with a fantastic hot breakfast that is free if you're a Starwoods member but still a great value if not. It's also open for lunch and dinner, and the food is simply delicious and reasonable too--also never busy. Last time we were here in August, they let us sit outside by ourselves and turned the mister on just for us. We like to get a room on the ground floor facing the pool. The grounds and the flowers are beautiful. Rooms are nice with those great Sheraton beds and plenty of pillows. When we stayed a week ago, we got a special $60 deal, but even normally the prices are very reasonable. The pool is big enough and always clean, the jacuzzi always works, the work-out room has a TV and when there's any kind of problem, the staff comes running. We love it so much, we're thinking of spending our 15th anniversary here instead of some overpriced resort that turns out to be disappointing.

<Content>There Aren't That Many Starwood Dumps Around, But This Is One This Four Points property is a dump. It's old, the non smoking rooms smell like smoke (or it could be mildew). I checked in at 9pm and asked for a non-connecting room and when I opened my door, it was a connecting room. At 9pm on a Monday night, the bar was closed, the restaurant was closed and the little store was closed, so if you want anything to eat/drink, you need to leave the hotel. Oh yeah, the front desk guy told me there are vending machines next to the ice machines (I checked two floors and there are NO vending machines next to the ice machines.)The hallways are dingy and smell of mildew. The carpet is, well, let's just say that you should keep your shoes on. The shower is in a half-tub. I've never seen one before, but it's literally a half a tub. There is FREE water in your room...one bottle that is. And, as a Starwood Preferred Guest Gold member, you get upgraded' to a dumpy room on the ground floor facing the parking lot (room #150). There are no SPG perks at this hotel, so stay elsewhere.

<Content>cool hotel in a hot city Our traveling party only stayed one night in this chain hotel located in Phoenix across the street (within walking distance) from alarge shopping area full of eateries, a Barnes  Noble and even a grocery store. The staff were friendly, helpful. They provide 2 free internet access computers in the lobby with free printing. The buffet breakfast (included) provided a wide selection including make-it-yourself waffles. Fresh fruit, egss, meat, yopgurts and cereals/breads. Lots of light. Clean. Rooms included ipod ports. Separate toilet from sink area allowing more than 1 person to get ready in the morning. Enough room to walk around.I would recommend this hotel which is fairly close to the airport.

<Content>Very Nice Palce I had to travel to Phoenix on business for 8 days and chose the Sheraton Four Points Metro Center. It is surrounded by many restaurants (Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Chili's, El Torrito) and next to the Metro Center mall. The location is great for a business travel, because when you get back to the hotel, you don't have to drive far to get dinner.The room I stayed in (#148) was nice. A little older, but quiet and comfortable. It had BLAZING wireless internet, that never failed and connected instantly. A big plus for business. There was a small fridge and coffee in the room. I liked the to-go cups for the coffee and used them as I rushed out the door to my appointments. I stored all my water bottles and leftovers in the fridge, so it was very much appreciated.There is a restaurant and bar / lounge on the premises. I ate dessert (pecan pie that was to die for!) and had drinks there. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. It seemed everyone I spoke with there, was really enjoying their stay.One great amenity that I wasn't expecting was poolside food and drink service. After 5pm you can order food and drinks from the pool area (burger and a beer!) and charge it to your room. Such a great plus if you're weary from your day and just want to relax and not have to go anywhere.I had a chance to speak with one of the owners of the hotel who seemed very interested in the guest's viewpoint. He mentioned that they would be renovating the rooms and some of the common areas before the busy fall / winter season. All in all, I really like the hotel and would gladly recommend it to others. I will definitely be back!

<Content>Oldie but Not So Goodie Great Staff, but old hotel that needs updating.In our three day stay we changed (moved) suites twice. The suite we checked into had no towels and an inoperative phone so the staff suggested we move to a Casita suite by the pool. It was nice but noisey, every fan in the suite either rattled, whistled or buzzed. We worked with it, but on night two we discovered we were sharing our room with multi-legged crawley creatures. Naturally, we moved again. The price was right and the location was OK, but we're NOT going back.

<Content>Very nice hotel The Four Points is a nice upscale hotel at a very reasonable price. Rooms are clean and bright and the walls are acceptably thick; I could hear my neighbors but only during one of their several climaxes. Most of the hotels are on the dingier westside of town, but don't let that stop you---it's not a bad neighborhood, and there are several national restaurant chains closeby, but the trendy part of town is a few miles away. No free breakfast, but for $8.95 there's an all you can eat breakfast buffet.

<Content>Big, Clean, Great!!! I wasn't expecting anything great from this hotel, but boy was I pleasantly surprised! The room was really large, extremely clean, and very comfortable. Everything was very cute (pillows labeled with soft, firm, cute amenities in the bathroom, etc) and just so nice! I wasn't expecting to love it so much. The hotel isn't in the most exciting area, but I was looking for somewhere to stay and didn't mind driving to places.

<Content>Lovely We loved it here! Very impressed.The hotel was modern, the rooms and bathroom were clean, and the beds had lovely bedding on them.It had all the amenities including an empty fridge which was great for storing some snacks in. We loved the coffee machine too.The pool looked very inviting even though it was a little too cold for us!The location was great... not in the downtown area (obviously) but in amongst several shopping centres within walking distance.We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!

<Content>Clean, Comfortable,Convenient Loved the convenience of this simple, but nice hotel, priced for the average folks. Hotel has bar, and resturant with deluxe continental buffet. cereal, breads, fruits, eggs, sausage etc. it was about $10/person, but you can get 2 for 1 coupon online. Nice large pool with towels, computers at lobby . 12 to Peoria, 10 minutes to Heard Musuem. From Hotel you can walk across the street to the Barnes and Noble, Black angue, Coaster and Castle Theme Park$27/perpson and the Mall. You can walk 5 minutes to many more food, drug stores and more shopping. As others have already state the in room conveniences it was a nice newly remodeled room, very comfy would tell everyone. We paid $120/with AAA discount.

<Content>Nice Stay This stay at the Four Points was great!Check in was fast and easy. The staff was pleasent and explained the hours of the resteraunt, the free use of the computer to check in for flight, the pool, etc.The room was clean and a nice size. I had a room overlooking the pool on the third floor. The room comes with in room coffee maker, bottled water at no charge. The hotel is about 20 minutes from where we were going out for the evenings and is near a mall. We did not eat at the mall or off property resteraunts. Had breakfast at the hotel, very simple buffett and not the best but not the worst I have had. There is a Denny's right down the road which would be less expensive. We ate there each of the three mornings for the convience of it all.The bar is small but nice. The bartender was very friendly and they even had a happy hour with $3 drinks! The maid service was good, the room was always spotless and clean.The pool is simple and has a spa. Overall I would stay here on my next visit to Phoenix. The price is great, good staff and easy to get where you need to go.Only drawback it is about 30-45min from the Airport.

<Content>Good location, awful breakfast We were visiting Phoenix for a vacation weekend and I've stayed at other Four Points in LA so I thought this would be a good mid range place to stay. The location around the Metro Center mall in the northern part of town is very good. It's easy on/off the freeway and about 1/2 hour to either downtown or Scottsdale. There are plenty of chain restaurants like Red Lobster, Olive Garden, etc. for decent dinners, and shopping for those who are into that. I found the hotel was not up to the level of the two Four Points I've stayed in elsewhere. The room looked tired and the bathroom was smaller than their other locations.By the way, I'm a Starwood Gold member, so I assume my room was one of the better ones. Our price included full buffet breakfast, and I have to say it was one of the worst I've had anywhere. The first day they ran out of coffee before we arrived in the restaurant and it only was replenished after I had eaten. The cereal (raisin bran) was definitely generic, and also stale. There was only whole milk (so much for healthy eating), and the bread and pastries were pretty awful as well. Fruit was your typical cut cantaloupe and honeydew, both of which were tasteless. There were supposed to be vending machines on each floor, but the one on my floor was missing, and my search only turned up a soda machine on the floor below.I was scheduled to stay at another Four Points in another city this week, and when I got home I canceled and booked a different chain. Two days at this one was quite enough for one month.

<Content>Much better then last visit We stayed here two years ago while it was under remodeling, now it's much better. Room was clean and bed was comfy.They have one of the best fitness rooms that we have ever seen in a hotel this size, very new equipment and free weights.We ordered room service many times and they did a great job and the food was yummy! Did the breakfast buffet on Sunday morning and it was a mess, must have been short staffed. They comped us a free breakfast for the trouble and that was fair.Free internet and a comp/printer in the lobby..nice!We will be back!

<Content>A Wonderful Experience We got a king non-smoking room with a AAA rate of $89/night and stayed for 3 nights. Upon our arrival, we were greated by very friendly staff. They let us check in 3 hours early and upgraded us to a garden view room for free. The outside garden area was beautifully maintained and decorated with lights for the holiday season. Though we didn't take advantage of the pool, I scoped it out. It appeared heated and had food/drink service available. The hotel was in a convenient location within walking distance to restaurants and close to I17 for easy travel. The staff was awesome. Our room was very clean and they gave us plenty of the amenities offered (coffee, creamer, etc). Good quality stuff too. No complaints at all!!!!!

<Content>Nice Hotel Nice, reasonably priced hotel.. staff was very polite and super helpful. Every week the hotel has a specially themed poolside party, serving food, drinks, and showing movies. Had a very relaxing time at the Metrocenter. However, be prepared to pay about $40 for the super lloonnnggg cab ride from the airport.

<Content>Pleasant surprize for the price! We needed a hotel fairly close to The Glendale arena to attend a concert. But, we also wanted to be able to enjoy a resort type setting with a great pool and nice rrom at a very affordable rate. We got just what we asked for. I used the hotel website and got a $65 summer rate with 2 double beds. We were upgraded upon arrival (ask and you shall receieve) to a ground floor room with a walk out to the pool view. It was very convenient and what a view. The room was very nice and seemed to be updated nicely. The bathroom was exceptionally large with a large sink area seperate from a vanity area and an interesting but nice shower/tub combo. Lots of water pressure and heat from the bath. There was a pocket door in the toilet shower area and a swivel type shuuter style door that closed off the bath from the bedroom area if you wanted too. I liked that since I had an 8 year old son with me. As a Starwood Preferred Guest, along with my email confirmation, I was sent a B1,G1,Free breakfast buffet coupon which was really nice and above average. Lots of fresh food to choose from.Can't say enough about the pool. Maybe I just needed the break, but it was large, clean and sparsely occupied. There were lots of pool toys, floats, noodles and the like provided by Four Points.Lastly, staff was very friendly and accomodating. We were able to recieve a later check out so that we could enjoy the pool just a bit longer. We would go back again.

<Content>Good jumping off point Okay hotel. Near mall and other stores, but not near downtown or Scottsdale.Our room was nice as the bed was comfortable and spacious. The problem with the hotel is more on the inside. The hallway was a bit dated and had a musty smell. There was also a McDonald's bag on the floor the evening we checked in and it was still there the morning we checked out.The buffet was good, but there were no pancakes and waffles available. The pool looked nice. We did not use it however.All in all, it is a good hotel, with some shortcomings. We used it as a jumping off point after landing in Phoenix and heading to points north.

<Content>Great vacation hotel with great location This is one of the best hotels for the price. At $69 a night over the memorial day weekend, this hotel is a great deal. My gf and I stayed at a regular room with a King size bed. There was a small refrigerator where we stocked our bottled water for the hot summer weather in Phoenix. There was a large CRT TV (probably about 27). The mattress had a padded top so it was very soft and comfortable.The bathroom had a shower and a small tub. It wasn't not a jacuzzi tub so no jet streams. I imagine for a jacuzzi tub, guests would have to shell out extra for a suites. Worry not, there's a public jacuzzi right by the public swimming pool. The swimming pool was big with heated and salted water (not chlorinated).A couple of days before my arrival at the hotel, the hotel sent out an email to give me a coupon for 1-for-2 breakfast. Otherwise, the breakfast costs $8.95 per person. Breakfast buffet was consisted of standard fares of scrambled eggs, French toast, sausage, oatmeal, cereals, yogurt, bread and bagel, and some other stuff. Nothing fancy. A la carte is also available at additional cost.

<Content>Really friendly staff! The hotel is located in a shopping and busienss district and perfectly fitted my needs. I went there on business just for one night, value for money was reasonable and the hotel was conveniently located for my needs. Internet is uncomplicated and free, they have a pool and a nice gym. Best thing was the staff. I needed to change money from Euro to Dollars and unfortunately no american does without you being a client of them. The front desk supervisor solved this very well, took me with him to his bank and changed the money for me. I will always come back to the hotel when coming to Phoenix!

<Content>Lovely! Perfect Business Hotel The Sheraton Four Points Metrocenter is a perfect place to stay on business. It has a nice restaurant (I ate there for breakfast and dinner), pool, outdoor jacuzzi, FREE wireless Internet access, Wednesday evening reception for corporate guests, and the rooms are modern and cheerful. The staff is definitely friendly and are very cheerful with guests. I definitely plan to return.

<Content>Not Up to Scratch Let鈥檚 face it this hotel has problems. The room I had was not that great for a deluxe room. The bathroom was small with no tubs and just a shower. The air conditioning unit was very noisy. The carpet was not clean. There was a mini refrigerator out in the open of the room. The overall appearance of the lobby and elevators is tacky. The pool is not inviting. The gym was not good due to equipment not being maintained properly. The staff were somewhat friendly and do try to provide some customer service. Overall, I would not stay at this Four Points Hotel again. My experience and impression of the Hotel was one of a rundown Hotel on the verger of trying to meet the Starwood/Sheraton standards. The Hotel falls short.

<Content>Very nice, and at a good price! We have stayed here twice. The remodeling is completed, so previous reviews about older furnishings and debris are no longer applicable. Everything has been attractively redone except for the shower stalls (if you're looking for a soaking tub, this isn't the place.)At the AAA rate of $59 (summer season) the Sheraton Four Points is a bargain. The king beds are extremely comfortable, with feather sleeping pillows and large feather throw pillows for resting in bed or watching TV. The TVs are large, with Showtime and around 23 channels -- adequate. The rooms have a desk and an easy chair, decent lighting, granite counter in the bathroom, fluffy towels, and individually-controlled air. The staff is very helpful. The first time we stayed, as Starwod Preferred Guests, we were given a free upgrade.The second time we stayed the hotel was rather full and there were a few people smoking on our nonsmoking floor, giving the hall a bit of a smoky odor. We got a towel from the front desk to put under the door. Overall, for the comfort and the price, this hotel can't be beat. We have become loyal customers.

<Content>Loved the Four Points Phx Metrocenter I stayed here for four nights and enjoyed it very much. The room was comfortable, the area was quiet (despite being so close to the freeway),  the staff were friendly and helpful. The restaurant was excellent and good value for money, with no waiting! Metrocenter has lots of nice restaurants to choose from, but my friends and I were very happy to eat at the restaurant because the food was just as good and the same price as the external restaurants - and there was no waiting! Dan, the bartender, was good fun and very entertaining. The pool area was a great spot for relaxing and chatting. I loved the fact that I could walk to the shopping mall and some other big local stores, and the library next door would be a great place to take bored children as they had lots of things to do to keep kids occupied. I will definitely stay there again and would happily recommend it to family  friends.

<Content>One of the nicer Four Points in the system With the exception of a 'needs help' floor of the shower, my wife and I were pleased with this property. It's about 25 minutes north and west from the airport (PHX).We booked a $59 AAA rate that included breakfast certs. The breakfast was a self-serve hot/cold buffet. Nothing fancy. Plenty to get you started. I thought the room was over-sized for a Four Points vs previous 4 Pts that I've stayed at.There is a biz center to the right of the front desk; with free computer access.We'd go back.

<Content>better than expected After reading the reviews I thought Oh my God where am I going to be staying, but to my surprise the hotel is really clean. Everything smells well, breakfast is great, the hotel room and bed is very comfortable with a huge tv and you can hardly hear the neighbours.Fantastic,Victor

<Content>Not what I was expecting from Four Points The room was large, but not as nice as I expected. The view behind my room was consturction of some kind. The tub was tiny. They had to reset the wireless router several times so I could use the wireless network. They sent the mechanical engineer to my room when I asked for assistance with the network. He was nice but not helpful.  I was told by several not to park on the side of the hotel and not to leave after dark because it was not a safe area. Because I was a person traveling alone, I was a little scared. It put a damper on my stay. Breakfast was a nightmare. If you stay here, go with plenty of time to spare. All four days when I went to the breakfast buffet (7:30 - 8:00 am), I had to wait for a table and wait for the food to be replaced.. Now for something nice. The pool and hot tub were great. Housekeeping did a good job.I wish I had checked the reviews here first!

<Content>great service great parking, good service, great air conditioning and for the price the rooms were more than acceptable. Really good breakfast too. This isn't the Ritz but it beats a Holiday Inn or travelodge.

<Content>at first I thought it was Faulty Towers on checking in we were allocated a king room for 4 adults despite booking a double double room. hotel was full so had to make do for one night! too tired to care. Breakfast was a disaster zone, I understand the hotel was full but no clean tables, nobody organising guests, food depleted, no menus ofered, cold coffee, no milk on tables etc etcafter a full dy out and requiring a quick change for dinner we were told our new room was not ready nor were any other rooms, we had to use the old room to shower, run down corridors with wet hair, half unpacked bags to get dressed for our dinner date. all in all a very negative experience.The breakfast the next day was marginally better but what hotel/restaurant or even BB has crushed table cloths on the table ? Picky ? well just very basic standards.The rooms were good, good size, good facilites, great shower although I agree some of the refurb was dodgy- half painted bathroom door ???The hotel ground floor looks refurbished and the general areas too but had a sad feeling of no atmospehere overall. not sure why, a feeling of uncared for neglect ? didn't have any other food as found Mimi's across the lot and Starbucks inside Barnes and Noble.the hotel served a purpose for us as we were visiting family nearby and as it was Spring Training our options were limited. just surprised the Sheraton name was over the door, felt more like a Travelodge

<Content>Great staff! Hotel so-so, steadily improving under renovation The Four Points by Sheraton Phoenix Metrocenter really needed professional attention sooner, but the patient shows promising signs of recovery. I stayed here as part of a group trip, assigned to the hotel by chance, not choice. After reading reviews here on TripAdvisor, my concern levels elevated, but it proved a pleasant stay.First impressions from the lot and outside help the hotel. The hotel keeps the lot clean, the landscaping looks nice, and the outside of the hotel looks clean. The parking lots provide ample space and the decent lighting helps you feel safer walking up to the lobby. The hotel sits within the Metrocenter shopping area--good chain restaurants such as Olive Garden and Bennigan's abound within easy walking distance, as does shopping obviously.The lobby and registration desk dress to impress--soaring open space with plant draped peek-throughs from upper floors, a large sunken pit area with lots of nice comfortable heavy leather furniture and tables, a raised area with large bookshelf spaces, tables with nice chairs, and some other furniture in small groups. Look closer, though, and you see a few problems. Two bench style seats along the railing surrounding the sunken pit area looked quite sorry--one showed multiple pulls in the fabric and both carried the crud of many years' use--large darkish areas on the arms and seats, nicks in the wood finish. They should hide these two seat benches from guests' view for now until they refurbish them. In the raised area with the bookcases, you see that the books remain only for show--mostly multivolume sets of huge outdated legal code books, with just a few novels tucked in several hundred pounds of books. Two cream-colored upholstered armchairs in the corner near the walkway to the restaurant really detracted from this area, too. They showed the grunge of several years of use, too--I wouldn't sit in one in all honesty. These two chairs should disappear from guests' view, too, until more presentable. The carpet shows a few dark stains here and there, too. The courtyard looks really nice--healthy trees illuminated at night by mini white light wrapped trunks, tile walkways--very pleasant. The pool and hot tub looked very clean. I did not partake, but I saw others enjoying these facilities. The staff at the desk proved very nice and knowledgeable. They must be under some stress with the corporate Sheraton folks constantly in and out during the refurbishment. We saw the desk staff talking with departing corporate personnel late one night while we loitered in the lobby. Maybe the staff are more relieved to finally see renovations under way, then they are stressed to have corporate in and out all of the time : )The gift shop off the lobby proved a pleasant surprise. Tidy, neat and clean, with a nice selection of, I can't hardly believe it, reasonably priced almost to the point of saying bargain priced items. $3 dolphin figurines, $3 attractive margarita candles, floating rose candles, AZ t-shirts starting at 2/$10, and other nice items. Definitely better than many of the mall and airport souvenir shops encountered on this trip.Some of the hallways do stink. I thought it smelled like a bathroom not really clean lurking behind a door--okay, I'll say it--old urine. I am more sensitive to smells than others--many of my companions noticed nothing, but a few others thought it smelled, too. Some of the hallways show a lot of beating--big bangs out of the corners in many spots, jagged uneven ceiling cracks running the length of some hallways near one wall, a huge wooden armchair with nice upholstery but badly nicked wood sitting out of place outside the elevator, a new threshold cut and ready to install leaning against the wall, a smoke detector and trim pieces left outside a room door, plaster or some other building material marks in the carpet outside many room doors, and so on. It definitely shows evidence of serious renovations in progress, but undertaken long after needed. The hallways proved a little toasty, but the guest rooms and public rooms all remained pleasant.The room itself smelled clean and appeared clean, other than another one of those cream colored upholstered chairs identical to the two dirty ones in the lobby making its appearance in the corner of the room like a fungus growing up in a flower garden. It took a few tries to find a working light, though. Flipping the switch in the hall just inside the door produced no light. Turning on one of the lamps above the nightstands produced no light. Only after walking to the other end of the room and trying the floor lamp did a working light turn up. Good thing the hall remains well lit and that the curtains remain open to let in some of the nighttime lighting, or you might bump into several things trying to ever find a light when you first check in to your room.The comfortable king-size bed faces the large window, but remains out of view from the hall door, something I appreciate. The desk near the window has ample lighting and space to work. Two compact elegant wood nightstands flank the headboard. The sconce lamps above each nightstand beam with nice clean white fabric shades, well, that is once you call the front desk and get lightbulbs for the lamps. During the renovation, someone took them out of the lamps or never put them in there in the first place. The lady from the front desk came up herself with the bulbs promptly, put them in, and apologized. She conducted herself in a professional but friendly manner.The bathroom floor shines with great looking new marble tile. When you open the closet, however, you see bare concrete with old dried mastic compound--no tiles or covering at all. Renovation looking good here, but obviously not finished yet in this room. The strange angled low tub (or extra deep shower basin?) in a square unit looks older--the porcelain not so glossy any more, but clean. No black stuff appeared during showers as other folks reported from their stays. Water pressure and temperature ranked as good, and the toilet flushed well.The safety latch that you flip over to keep folks from entering from the hall showed signs of hasty or at least uncoordinated replacement. The flip over portion mounted on the frame hit the door about two inches above the ball portion mounted on the door, rendering it utterly useless. A renovation of this size will obviously require a lot of follow up on issues like this one.An ice run took longer than anticipated. A taped handwritten note on the fourth floor ice machine informed you it was out of order. The third floor proved interesting--obviously under serious renovation here. Buckets in the hall, plastic Big Gulp cups from workmen, the smell of adhesive compounds in the air, and an ice machine that was also out of order, but not marked. The second floor ice machine was working well and obviously new.A group dinner at the hotel for a conference turned out a mixed bag, but by far positive. The main course consisted of a fresh, tasty grilled chicken salad served in a fried tortilla bowl. The German chocolate cake for dessert, however, while it tasted okay, contained no coconut, substituted peanuts for the pecans, and other deviations--not at all what most would consider German chocolate cake. The main dish salad proved more than ample to satiate your appetite, so you didn't really need the cake anyway.In summary, would I stay here again? Yes. The staff proved excellent. The hotel facility itself was let go too long, but they are pouring a lot of money and effort into refurbishment to bring it back. I think it will be a comlpete jewel again given a few months more renovation. The rooms are clean and quiet at a decent rate.

<Content>Needs Work I have to agree with others. If I hadn't been locked into the reservation I would've gone to the other hotels in the area. The only good thing I heard was that staff from corporate was there looking to remodel the place. I hope they do. The biggest concern I had was that during the night and early mornings our shower would back up with black stuff. It really concerned me when I heard the same complaint from others staying there but nothing was ever done by the staff there.The good note that the staff was pleasant and nice considering what they had to deal with.But be warned, find someplace else to stay!

<Content>Yikes! Try to stay elsewhere! This place is a sorry excuse for a Four Points by Sheraton. It is run-down, really showing its age, and seems like a hotel that would only be popular with the high school prom night crowd or the one-night-in-Phoenix-tourbus group. Our room was dirty, dark, and dated. The tile in the bathroom was dirty, the upholstered chairs in the living area were too scary to sit on, the bed linens were too thin, and the bed was extremely lumpy. Ugh! Even the mere memories of thiis room send shivers up my spine. One of the worst I've ever stayed in.We did try to enjoy the hotel's free continental breakfast that they provided (not sure if this is free for all guests or if it was part of my Starwood Preferred Gold status). At any rate, we would have done well to avoid it entirely. We both got violently ill after eating here and it took a whole day out of our vacation in Sedona to recover. There are plenty of fine hotels in Phoenix ... and even the Metrocenter area. Try those instead.

<Content>The reviews don't lie -- don't stay here My family had two stays at this hotel for a total of 4 nights in late April 2005. I had already prepaid for everything through Priceline so I couldn't get my money back or change hotels. We were sceptical because of what I had read on tripadvisor but we tried to keep an open mind. When we first arrived we were impressed with the lobby. It stops there. The restaurant was desserted. The pool was disgusting and smelled nasty. It looked clean but the grime on the water line all the way around the pool was black, no kidding. The second time we stayed it was worse.The carpets in the room were really dirty. The beds were very uncomfortable. The tv did not work properly and it only had 5 available channels. They have shutter doors that cover the windows and on our second stay as soon as we arrived we opened the doors to open the window and the door fell off. We told the front desk and someone was supposed to fix it and they never did. The wallpaper wasn't peeling off in either of the rooms we had and the bathrooms were fairly clean. We paid a good amount of money to stay here and I wish there was a way for me to get a refund. There is also a very large sports bar across the street next to Olive Garden and both times we stayed here the noise kept us up. In fact one night there were two men beating up another man in the parking lot right next to our car. This is NOT a good place for kids or families. If you only end up paying $40 a night it might be tolerable but otherwise blow past this place and find something else!I even considered taking photos to show what this place REALLY looks like but it wasn't worth my time or the digital space on my camera. It does not look like the photos that you'll see on the web -- not even what the Starwood hotels website show.

<Content>Rundown and ratty I stayed at this hotel for three nights. The staff was very nice, but the hotel was falling apart. The carpet was threadbare, the shower was not working very well, and the palce smelled. To make things worse, even the amenities were bad: the hottub was not working while I was there and the exercize room was falling apart. The treadmill has to be about 20 years old, and even the vinyl on the weight set was cracking. I asked them to move me to an upgraded business room after two nights, but that was exactly the same! The only difference was free internet access. I told the staff how run down the room was and they obviously had heard it many times before - they just apologized.This place is close to another new Sheraton that would be much better if you need to be in this part of Phoenix. The only thing this hotel has going for it is the proximity to the Metocenter Mall, but the mall has seen better days too. . .

<Content>Great Hotel! The Four Points was great hotel for the price. Great courtyard with a clean impressive pool area. The staff was the best I have ever encountered, and all employees said hello or How is everything. I do not think you would experience a hotel staff this great unless your dropped over $200. Great Hotel!

<Content>shabby and run down Threadbare carpeting, dingy walls (stained paint and tattered wall paper), dilapadated furniture (cigarette burned ragged arm chair, broken-down armoire etc.), these rooms did not come close to what I expected from a Four-points Sheraton accomadation.
