<Content>A very nice hotel We stayed here two nights after Christmas. The front desk was outstanding. We arrived very early in the morning, and they held our bags until about noon and then checked us in while we were out sightseeing. They had reserved two museums for us (Uffizi and Accademia) and knew the times of the reservations before I even introduced myself. The best two restaurants we ate at in Florence (Brincello and Nerone) were a block in either direction. The hotel is about 2 blocks from the train station, although the road wasn't well marked and we missed it the first time by, but it was very convenient for that as well.

<Content>Great hotel - great location We had a great stay at this hotel! Our room was spacious, with a big bed, nice bathroom, working AC and sound proofed windows. We were on the second floor and the traffic on Via Nazionale did not bother us, at all. The hotel is well located, two blocks from the train station, very close to San Lorenzo church, and at walking distance from the Duomo. During our stay in Florence we walked everywhere - no need for public transportation. The breakfast was good - it offered a selection of pastries, ham, toasts, cereal, yogurt; but the filtered coffee was terrible. However, as we learnt, you can ask for espresso, latte or capuccino at no charge, just tell the server. We saw an Italian couple doing that, and we didn't hesitate to leave our filtered coffee aside and get the good one. The front desk staff was ok, no problems there.

<Content>Liked the Corona Spouse and I visited Florence and stayed here during the first week of May. We had a nice stay overall. The hotel is very easy walking distance from the train station. We had no problems getting there. The staff was always pleasant and approachable. Gave us a tip to try a restaurant around the corner when asked. It was Trattoria Za Za. Excellent recommendation. We loved the food there. Room was spacious and pretty clean. The bed was quite hard, however. Bedding was decent. There is an interesting control panel on the wall that works the TV, radio and room temp - takes a second or two to figure out (some of the labeling on the buttons worn away). Our room was facing the inner courtyard - which was definitely not noisy. You could hear a little bit of traffic from time to time, but it quieted down nicely at night. Bathroom was clean - but the bidet was directly across from the toilet (and not much room in between). Had to step between them to get in and out of the shower. But not an inconvenience unless you're tall and need legroom for the toilet. (But upon looking at some of the pics on TA, not all of the bathrooms are set up this way). Breakfast was okay. Our favorite part: The hotel is very convenient to the open air markets. In fact, take a left out the door, and you're there. So many things to see in the market. Very nice leather goods available. There are two market buildings which house the food portion of the market. Highly recommend that if anyone wants a quick lunch, to go on in. It is open from 8am to 2pm.Upstairs there is a little lunch bar (we didn't try it). But we did go back a few times to a lady with a deli counter (she made the most delicious panini ever). Just wish I could remember exactly where she is. It's amazing to see all of the wonderful food stuffs there.If needed, there is a decent laundromat just down the same street (going away from the train station, and across the streeet). Can't remember the name, but it has very quick machines - the wash in 25 minutes and dried in 25 more minutes. We got there at 8am and had the place to ourselves.Overall, a decent stay.

<Content>Fine hotel in a great location with friendly staff I stayed here as part of a conference, and found it to be a fine, pleasant property with a good mix of local character and modern amenities. The staff were all helpful, friendly, proficient in English, and efficient. I found the rooms to be spacious and quiet, and the morning breakfast was very good. Although it didn't vary much from day to day, there was enough to choose from to make each morning different.My room on floor 3 ended up being too warm for my taste, but the windows didn't have screens, so I didn't feel comfortable leaving the windows open for better ventilation (plus the windows shut out street noise, which can be quite noticeable in the city). It would have helped to have a TV remote, a clock in the room, and a bit more explanation in the room (how to dial using the telephone, how to use the room control system, internet connectivity). But what the room lacked in explanation, the staff made up for in helpfulness (happy to give directions, provide wake-up call).I'm not sure if internet works this way in all the other hotels, but internet service was purchased in advance by the hour, and could be spread out over several days. So, your time on and off the internet was measured (be sure to disconnect when you're not using it), and I ended up spreading 10 hours of purchased internet over 5 days (but I didn't figure out if there was a way to monitor how much time you had left).The hotel was a great location for my conference in the Fortessa di Basso, and is very close to the train station. It was right next to a street market, which was interesting to browse through, and close enough for a nice walking tour of all the sights of Firenze. Overall, a very pleasant stay and I would recommend it for visitors to Florence.

<Content>Minutes from the Markets! The hotel is well placed a few minutes from the centre of Florence (Firenze).The rooms and services were good and clean. Breakfast included was extensive and well served. It could be served in the room for a small charge.The staff were extremely helpful and provided assistance in obtaining reserved gallery tickets, e.g. Uffici.Garage facilities across the road made it ideal for anybody driving themselves. 25 Euro per day.Many delightful resteraunts within a few minutes walk from the hotel, including a delightful/cheap one in the square behind the hotel.

<Content>Good value This is a conveniently situated hotel - very close to the station  the markets, and within easy walking distance to the Duomo  other attractions. Whilst the rooms are not big, and the bathroom is cramped, they are clean and appear to have been reburbished fairly recently. There is a safe  a reasonably priced mini bar, but it would be quicker to stick your head out of the windown than use the hairdryer provided! Breakfast is varied with fruit, cheese, bread  cakes but you can order fried eggs, omlettes etc if you want to pay extra. We didn't need to use the heating or the air conditioning so not sure what it would be like in the bedrooms in the height of summer or if it was really cold. The staff were very friendly  helpful. As we only paid 拢40 per night including breakfast for a double room I think that this was excellent value for money  would stay there again.

<Content>Pleasant Room, Central Location, Nice Price Price: Single room in mid-December 2007 for just under 100 USD per night.Location: The hotel is located a short (several block) walk from the Florence Santa Maria Novella train station. Il Duomo, Piazza della Signoria, Ponte Vecchio and the Uffizi Gallery are all within walking distance.Exterior Appearance: The hotel maintains a very nice exterior appearance which, in fact, appears to be a step above many of the other 3 star hotels in the immediate vicinity.Public Areas: All of the hotel public areas are tastefully appointed and of sufficient size (including the spacious breakfast room, bar and front-desk area). There are at least two small lifts available for use by hotel guests.Rooms: The single room in which I stayed appeared to be average size for a 3 star hotel in Florence (meaning it was on the small side). However, the room was fitted-out in such a way that it did not feel cramped. My room opened to a side street which, with the windows closed, presented no noise troubles. The bathroom came with quality soaps and gels. The single bed was comfortable. I would recommend asking for a room with a similar view, as it is possible the rooms that open to the main street are noisy.Staff: The staff was always very helpful and provided excellent and friendly tourist advice and service. I would especially note Daniel, although all of the staff members were, in fact, fantastic.All in all, this was a great hotel, especially for the price and I look forward to returning.

<Content>Nice enough, Simple, Plain.... Hotel Corona D鈥橧talia was fine. Not sure why TA writers love it, but it was adequate (maybe we were SO spoiled by our mini-suite at the Hotel Alexandra in Rome). We were there at the end of November, 2007.There were three efficient, not-too-small elevators, although we were on the 3rd floor and used the stairways. Good.Our room was simple at the Hotel D'Italia, plenty large, with modern bathroom. We couldn鈥檛 figure out how to keep the shower curtain from letting the shower flood the floor 鈥?but it was a regular tub with a regular shower curtain; no complaints. Good.The beds were slightly soft; bedding slightly old. The breakfast was abundant looking, but really not very good quality (bland breads and cakes; canned fruit, warmed quiche; cereals; not great, not hot coffee. Not Good, although the service was very attentive and hospitable. The Hotel Corona D'Italia staff at the desk was very, very helpful with Uffizi reservations, bus and train information, restaurant suggestions. Great. The hotel location was very convenient to the train station, the SITA bus station for a day-trip to Siena, and one block from the leather market, and there was a wonderful Osteria on the same street. There was also an adult shop across the street, and the street was a tad..... lower class (translated: seedy). Not great.PS - we booked the hotel through the hotel's website via email; no problems.

<Content>Best Hotel Stay We stayed in many hotels in Italy and this one was the best. Over and above sparkling service with a smile, great staff, fantastic breakfast, outstandingly tasteful and surprisingly roomy bedroom. Excellent location near train station and within walking distance of most downtown Florence sights and great restaurants. Simply a superb stay, really can't say enough to recommend. Having the lounge area and bar on the main floor was also a great bonus, most hotels are very cramped for additional space other than your room. We loved our stay here and would highly highly recommend it to anyone! STAY HERE, you will not regret it!

<Content>Great hotel My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Corona d'Italia in October 2007 and were very happy with the property. It was only an approx 7 minute walk from the train station. The markets (which I believe are the cheapest in Italy) are right next door.The breakfast room and breakfast were excellent.Beds need replacing, but room quiet and dark so you get a good sleep. Staff very helpful - nothing too much trouble.Across the road is a fantastic bar called Bar Small which is run by a lovely man Roberto and sells glasses of wine for 1.5 Euro.Certainly worth a visit.Would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel on future visits or recommending it to friends etc.KatePerth

<Content>Great Find! We spent 3 nights at Hotel Corona and had a lovely stay. Big bedroom and large enough bathroom, the room was quiet and dark - first place on our trip we got a decent night's sleep. Beds could be replaced with new ones, but it wasn't too bad. Breakfast was sufficient. Great location for the markets, duomo, train station. We would definitely stay there again. The only thing we had a problem with was the internet access. We had to pay for it and it wouldn't open half the sites we wanted to go to. But there are plenty of internet points nearby.

<Content>Value for Money Value for money, we chose this hotel because of the great reviews on Trip Adviser and we are pleased we did. Excellent Hotel, from the front of Railway Station walk straight across the road to i tourist information who were friendly and helpful,. 4 -5 minute walk starting with McDonalds on your left, then walk up the street keeping to the right. Friendly helpful Staff, Yes contrary to another review there is an elevator beside the stairs, excellent breakfast selection and breakfast MaitreD, Large breakfast room. Hotel reception booked a timeslot for the Last Supper in Milan at no extra charge, (5 day witing list) telephone # Lonely Planet)copious amounts of ice at no extra charge when I sprained my ankle, launderette and small supermarket within 20 mtrs of the hotel, if you open the double glazed window it will be noisy, as it overlooks the market and Duomo,ask for a room that overlooks the inner courtyard if noise is a problem, bathroom modern and clean, bedroom funiture a bit dated, cleanliness very good tho. If you have 1 day free, Venice is within easy reach, we took 730am Eurorail which arrives right in Venice beside the Canal, catch a river taxi to St Marks and its all there... Magic ..come back in the evening. We picked up a rental car on our last day, they all seem to be in the same part of town, quite walkable if ur a map reader, taxi 15 Euro aprox (sprained ankle). Enjoyable stay

<Content>Great Hotel near Most Visited Sites The Corona was recommended by our AAA advisor, and we were generally pleased with the hotel. Mostly modern facilities, however the elevators were small and cramped and were very noisey. Mattress was hard, and somewhat uncomfortable. Very good location, with a short walk to the train station. Most other sites in the old city were less than 45 minutes away. Close to the Duomo, and next to the Central Market. Many small stall shops near the hotel.Breakfasts were included in the room rate, and were very good, served in a nicely decorated dining room, on china, as opposed to the paper plates and cups found in a lot of American hotels.

<Content>An absolute gem We highly recommend the Hotel Corona d'Italia for its excellent location within Florence, being easy walking distance to... well, just about everything! It's 5 mins walk at most from the main train station, there are plentiful restaurants nearby (particularly recommend a small square at the back of the main market building for excellent choices), and it is slap back next to a wonderful street market.It's also on ly 5-10 mins, depending on your pace, to all the main sites such as the Duomo, Uffizi, etc and another 5 mins to the Ponte Vecchio.Standard throughout was superb in terms of cleanliness (the maids turned our jumble of a room every day into its original pristine sparkling state), hospitality and friendliness. We were running late on arrival at Pisa (overbooking of shuttle bus to Florence, make sure you get your purchased ticket checked to guarantee a seat!) and phoned ahead to ensure our room was safe (it was!), and by the time we walked into reception at 10pm were greated by name before we even opened our mouths! ALL staff were extremely friendly, from reception, to breakfast room to bar. They were so helpful, booking trips, offering maps, advising on restaurants and bars etc.The free breakfast was from 7-10am daily - very civilised, catering for those on business or holiday - and was plentiful, and frequently restocked. As mentioned by other reviewers, the coffee oddly left a lot to be desired, leaving a rather unpleasant after-taste - a once-tried, never again experience!The room was a good size (smallish, but definitely not cramped like we are used to!), well equipped (other than the appalling hairdrier - take your own!) and so spoltlessly clean. Bed was very firm, it has to be said, but we'd had that much Chianti each night we hardly noticed! Our room was at the back on the top floor and so we heard absolutely no sound at all, only birdsong and chuch bells chiming to wake us! Not sure it would be quite so quiet on the front, but the windows are doubled glazed and shuttered, both of which seemed very effective on light and noise.Florence was a lovely surprise in terms of its abundant pedestrianisation and the prices being far better than expected (though that may be because we're from the UK. In general, food and drink was cheaper than the equivalent at home.)The hotel was located next to a superb daily market mainly of leather goods, silks, and gorgeous bags, including the odd traditional gaudy souvenir stall. There was also a large indoor market selling the most amazing fresh food. Had we not stayed here, we might not have explored the market fully and would have missed some great bargains. Would happily stay here again and highly recommend it.

<Content>Walking distance from Train Station Clean, friendly and professional hotel about 10 min walk from the train station. Located at the start of San Lorenzo market. Many restaurants nearby as well as laundrymat if you need to clean a load. Breakfast was pretty good and I would recommend asking for the complementary cappuccino instead of the American coffee that they provide. Near Duomo and walking distance to everything. Ask for a map when you arrive, get your bearings and be prepared to do a lot of walking. They will also do reservations for the Academia and Uffizzi. For the Uffizzi, you should make your reservations at least a month before your visit. I booked the hotel reservations online. After I made my reservation, they sent me a confirmation with an email. For the museums I sent a copy of my reservations as proof that I was staying at their hotel and they made all my museum reservations for me,

<Content>Great Location! My husband and I just returned from Hotel Corona. This was our first trip to Florence. We had just arrived from the Rome airport and took the Eurostar train straight to Florence. Hotel Corona's location was PERFECT!!! We were tired from traveling and having a simple direct walk to the hotel while pulling our luggage was great.The Hotel staff were welcoming, the room was ample, the bathroom beautiful, the breakfast OUTSTANDING and the location . . .absolutely perfect. You literally walk out your hotel door to street after street of beautiful shops and quaint cafes. I WOULD HIGHLY recommend Hotel Corona. David is only two blocks away.

<Content>Fabulous hotel and location Perfect location and friendly staff. Clean and cool throughout, with helpful reception staff! As part of a large group, we had our own room for breakfast which was great, with one inexplicable exception - the coffee! The rolls one morning were still warm when I managed to be first down to breakfast, the fruit was ice-cold as were the juices and milk and the staff very helpful. It was all fantastic apart from the luke-warm grey coffee. Yes, grey!! Still, if that was the only complaint in a hotel then perhaps it wasn't such a bad show after all!The hotel promotes a restaurant on the back of the room cards when you book in, which is literally 2 mins walk away. Cannot recommend it highly enough for quality of food, wine, and service at very reasonable prices! We even went back for lunch 2 days later in a group of about 10 (and others scattered around the restaurant too). Fish a speciality on Fri and Sat and one guy travelling with us literally glazed over when she read the fish specials to him!But the absolute star of the show was David on the bar. Ever pleasant with great English and a ready smile, his good looks and excellent service made returning to the hotel bar after an evening out a pleasure. A delightfully old-fashioned guy ( I must be getting old as he appeared to me to be very young) David was the epitome of bar work at it's best, remembering drinks, preferences, entire rounds, and usually (when it was busy as he seemed to mostly work alone) receptive to the international nod of the head for another round when he was free. Having worked in the bar industry for many years, it was lovely to watch him work.I just hope that his gin stocks have recovered by now!Oh, and take an old adaptor with you as there seemed to be troubles with the new style ones not plugging in properly - You'll need one for a hairdryer as the ones in the bathroom are dreadful!

<Content>great hotel We stayed here as part of a large group and had a great time. Our room was very small but was fine, the air conditioning was very efficient and the bathroom was modern and clean.Staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast (apart from the dire coffee) is good.Location is superb. I would stay here again.

<Content>Loved this hotel My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel while on holiday in Italy. The hotel is very well located close to the main railway station. It is also around the corner from the markets and very near all the tourist sights.Hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and fully air-conditioned. Breakfast was continental with plenty to eat.The hotel also recommended a beautiful Trattoria within walking distance called 'Trattoria Piero y Enzo', which served the most beautiful and reasonably priced food I have ever tasted in Italy. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Florence.

<Content>Cant say I loved it The location, as mentioned already, is the best thing about this hotel. It is literally within walking distance of the train so it saves the hassel of taxi rides, transfers, etc.Its on a very dirty, busy road. The hotel lobby is not very nice. The staff are helpful. Breakfast selection is the worst we had over our two month trip. Once you get into the rooms theyre not too bad. Tiled floors and quite clean. Air conditioning works great. There is a market and shopping very close to this hotel.If you want to eat at a fantastic restaurant close by you must visit 'Cafe Za Za' in the market square. One of the best meals we had in Italy.

<Content>Great for the price My boyfriend and I recently stayed here on a four day trip to Florence, and it was fantastic. Location is perfect, it's just steps from the train station and some of the best sites in town, as well as the market where we did all of our shopping. The room was a decent size and clean. Our window did not face the market, so it was very quiet, which was nice. Only negatives were the bed was not the most comfortable and the air conditioning didn't get it as cool as we would have liked - but neither was a big problem. The staff was extremely helpful, they made museum reservations for us, which is a huge time saver. The breakfast was good and filling and the dining room was nice. I'd recommend based on location alone.

<Content>Location of Hotel Corona D'Italia, Florence The hotel is close to the train station. It was harder to find beacuse the street Via Nazionale is not visable from around the train station. When you walk out of the train station, look for the i Information center. (They are not helpful with directions. They don't speak very good English and they seemed to be in a hurry to get rid of me even though they were not busy).Anyway, walk out of the i center and take a right and cross the double street. Then go to the left and turn right at the big shoe store. Walk about a block and you will see the hotel.I was very happy with the hotel staff and the room. The breakfast is ok, not the best. The bed is hard as usual. The room was clean. The only problem I had is that I get hot easily and the room was hot and I could not get the air to work so I opened the window. That was a big mistake because it is so noisy, it was horrible. It sounded like there was a mental hospital on the street (loud screaming all night). I finally closed the windown and was able to get some sleep.

<Content>Great for a 2-Star I stayed here along with 42 other students and 4 teachers for four nights. I have to say, having stayed in a 2-star the year before on a large group trip, I wasn't expecting much. However the quality of this hotel was remarkable. The rooms were spacious and quiet and the staff were very patient with the noise and commotion naturally created by such a large group of people. Everyone was greatly impressed and I am sure that the teachers will turn to this hotel as a choice again in years to come.

<Content>Loved it! Can't wait to come back! Wonderful stay! Super friendly folks in a beautiful room and extremely convenient location. Their breakfast was filling in the American sense, not super fancy but it was free and filling if you are used to eating a hearty breakfast in the morning. They were super sweet and allowed us to keep our bags there past outr stay and it was only a hop, skip and a jump to the train station. My bofriend just recently went back to do some business there and was upgraded for free into a larger bed! The Maitre 'D was a gem and I truly felt I was staying at a grand place. I also recommend a wonder restaurant near by called Palo de Oro (literally golden balls), good wonderful food!

<Content>Super What a super hotel, lovely convenient position, with friendly staff. We have just spent a super weekend in Florence, my husband, son 11 and myself, and chose this hotel on the internet because of its location being close to all places of interest and such a short distance from the railway, considering the carrying of bags on arrival and at the end of our stay. This hotel added to our overall enjoyment of Florence. It is very clean, pleasant on the eye and just what you would want.

<Content>Super hotel in a great location. Warm  spotlessly clean, freindly and helpful staff. The rooms were excellent with a little noise but after all you must expect some in a city. Despite earlier reviewers comments, the breakfast was absolutley first class. A definite stay again hotel for any future trip to Florence

<Content>You get what you pay for The sheets were stiff and rough, the staff not very helpful or courteous, and the room very noisy. It is worth it to speak up, though, because at first they gave us a room with 2 single beds on the first floor, even though we reserved a double room. We said something, and they moved us to a bigger room with a King bed and bigger bathroom on the 3rd floor. We still heard noise from the maids pushing their carts around on the tile floors in the hallway early in the morning (the hallways and rooms were not carpeted). The breakfast was mediocre, called a 鈥渂uffet breakfast鈥?with no hot food, some weird-looking cold cuts, cheeses, pastries, yogurt and some fruit. We found no hot water if we tried to shower around 8:30 in the morning, but it was fine if we showered later in the day. The best thing about our hotel was the location, which was a five-minute walk from the train station, right near the Mercato Centrale (central marketplace, like a flea-market with indoor food vendors), and 10 minutes from the Duomo.

<Content>Never Again! We stayed in this hotel for two nights. Note to all travelers: Do NOT stay in this hotel if you plan to drive yourselves to Florence! We called the hotel THREE times on our cell phone for directions to the hotel from major landmarks within Florence. Each time, we were told that the directions were too confusing to explain. We spent FOUR hours driving around Florence and asking strangers for help before finding the hotel. If we had not had pre-paid reservations, we would have given up! Once we arrived at the hotel, we were told we had to pay 23 euro per day to park in a garage (or have our car towed from the street) even though we were told there was free parking when we made our reservation. The front desk staff was most unhelpful, slightly rude, and uninterested in helping tourists (we were not the only people, nor the only nationality, having trouble). Upon arrival, we were told we had to wait for the bellhop to escort us to our room (we had one suitcase, our room was on the second floor, and there was an elevator). We waited almost 10 minutes for the bellhop to come and though we tried to say several times during those 10 minutes that we could find our room ourselves, we were always told that we must wait. The room was of a good size but sparsely decorated. One of the larger bathrooms we had on our trip. The room was very clean and despite being located on a very busy street, little noise could be heard in the room. Location was fair, a fifteen or twenty minute walk to the Duomo. We would not recommend this hotel to car travelers or to travelers who are looking to stay in upscale hotels. The more modest price of this hotel is not worth the problems we had with it. Take our advice, spend a little more, and stay in a nicer hotel!

<Content>Excellent ! Do not let the anonymous outside appearance deceive you ! I stayed here recently for 6 days and I was very not disappointed. The room and bathroom were big and immaculately clean. The staff were very kind and helpful. Also, the hotel is close to the railway station which was very useful and also within walking distance to all the major sights. I would definitely recommend this hotel, you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Loved the corona d'italia Stayed here recentley with my best friend and it was great. The room and bathroom was spacious and luxurious. The windows had modern double glazing so had no noise at all. On our trip we also stayed in Rome and Venice and it was the best hotel out of all 3. It was bigger then most italian rooms and instead of a small cubicle that you usually get, it was a bath and shower. Everything was clean and they even folded my clothes for me!!! The staff were very curtious and helpful. They recommended a great restaurant, which was the greatest food I have ever tasted, called Za Za. It is close to the station which was very useful and also walking distance to all the major sights. I would deffinatley recommend this hotel, you will not be disappointed.
