<Content>City perfection Been to HK a number of times and stayed over at the Peninsula, original Mandarin Oriental and LKF. Have to say that the Landmark Mandarin Oriental beats them all. Location is second to none...right in the heart of Central, so perfect for shops, restaurants and bars.The service was exceptional and the staff went to extremes to ensure that all of my requests were fulfilled. Needless to say the concierge arranged tables at the last minute at all of HK's best restaurants, without any problem.I booked and L600, which whilst I didn't actually use it, had the largest bathtub I've seen in a hotel. The room was a really good size (for Hong Kong) and the spa, without question one of the best urban spas in the world!Superb stay....will definitely return!

<Content>A great contemporary hotel We stayed 3 nights at this hotel in a L450 room. It has a very contemporary design and is in a great location. The hotel is in Central and the main bar and restaurant precinct and also as mentioned previously attached to an exclusive shopping mall. We had breakfast one morning next door in the Landmark Cafe and it was really good. We did not go to any of the hotels bar or cafes but the bar in the lobby was very popular.The room itself was well designed, with a separate walk in robe/luggage area. A big king size bed and plasma/lcd tv with about 50 stations. One nice feature was it had double blinds which made the room very dark when sleeping and quiet. The L450 was not overly huge but so well designed with a little loveseat that it felt spacious. The bathroom had 2 basins and a separate shower and toilet (behind frosted glass doors) and a huge bath. Again it was very slick.We did not try the spa or indoor pool but were shown around and it did look very nice. Another nice touch was we had complimentary airport conceirge. We were met off the plane, had a cart take us to immigration and then were dropped off at our preferred transport option of a taxi. With an 11pm arrival time this was great.I really found this to be a great hotel and would go back if in Hong Kong. It had nice modern crisp lines but with a warmness that was lovely after busy days shopping.

<Content>Divine Stay Amazing hotel in an amazing city. Stayed there for a week while visiting family in Hong Kong. Enjoyed so very much the fantastic service in this hotel with particular mention of the incredible spa. Divine experience! Hong Kong is such a vibrant city and this hotel captures the essence of this amazing city and yet is an oasis in its own right. The suite, services, spa and MO Bar all contributed to a lovely experience and for those of you who are fans of Zuma in London, Zuma Hong Kong is right there in the Landmark. Oh... last but not least, what great shopping. We loved it, but be ready to spend some money and have fun.....

<Content>Wonderful hotel but no harbour views Stayed for 2 nights at the Landmark MO on business last week. Booked an L450 room but was upgraded to an L600 room upon arrival. The spacious, well equipped and beautiful room is one of the best (if not the best) contemporary hotel rooms that I have recently stayed in. Took a lot of photos as the design gave me a lot of ideas for my own apartment. The bathroom is huge (with a circular bath tub) and is well equipped with LCD TV and boutique aromatheraphy toiletries. 2 more LCD TVs - one in the bedroom the other in the living room. There is also a separate dressing room which can be closed off from the bedroom. Staff service is definitely 5 star - friendly and efficient. Managed to get a 4.00 pm late check-out which was great as my flight left in the evening. The hotel itself is above a luxurious shopping centre and is only about 5 to 10 minutes walk to the Airport Express station, business offices and other shopping centres!. I would suggest walking to/from the Airport Express station via the elevated walkways rather than underground through Central MTR. Taking a cab is also an option although, due to the short trip, some tax drivers may become a bit rude. Still, if you have a lot of luggage just persevere.Breakfast at the MO Bar is fine but not great (not on par with the breakfast spread at the MO in Singapore). However, had lunch at Amber which was truly wonderful (great service, interesting, beautifully presented and delicious food). Best Western meal in HK on this trip (also went to Spoon at the Intercon for dinner - beautiful setting and views but food not as good as Amber). Had a great cantonese meal at Lung King Heen - must be one of the best in town: great food  service + harbour views.Would certainly recommend the Landmark MO to friends especially those on business. For leisure trips though one ingredient is missing - harbour view rooms! And the view from Kowloon looking towards the Island is definitely better and more interesting than the reverse; so might choose a Kowloon hotel whenever in HK on vacation. But will definitely come back to Landmark MO on business (although itching to try the Four Seasons).

<Content>Truely amazing As soon as we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the super friendly hotel staff and immediately made us feel special. The reception staff made a huge fuss that our room wasn't ready and treated us to complimentary cocktails. When we were shown to our room we found complimentary chocolates and a letter which turned out to be a hand written apology from the manager for our room not being ready on time! The room itself was an L600 Deluxe, easily the nicest hotel room i've ever stayed in. The Spa and gym facilities were also amazing and the elevator also led down to the Landmark Shopping Centre where you can find top labels such as:- Jimmy Choo, Gucci, Prada.......more than worthy of a splurge!We absolutely adored our stay and have booked in again in October....we can hardly wait.

<Content>Simply excellent Spectacular room and bathroom - mind you you pay for it but the rooms are really excellent in every regard. Particularly liked the attention to detail at breakfast on the 7th floor and staff were simply attentive in every way. So you definitely get what you pay for here.

<Content>TWO THUMBS UP! If you are looking for a grand lobby with chandeliers and huge floral arrangements to greet you when you enter.. then this is not the hotel for you. The hotels lobby designed to be minimal and discreet. The times that i have stayed in this hotel i have never seen more than 3 people in the lobby ( except for the staff). The first time i stayed at the property i booked a L450 room. View was the building beside the hotel. The room was comfortable... bed was great. The bathroom took at least a third of the whole room. Very modern .. all mod cons .. flat screen one in the bedroom the other one in the bathroom. The second time i returned i was traveling with my S.O. and we decided to splurge a bit. Booked the L600 corner room. If your budget allows you to take this option please do... Its worth every dollar. When in Hong Kong location is the key...The property is perfect! beside Landmark (shopping ) LKF ( restaurants/bars) IFC (more shopping)

<Content>Wonderful Hotel I loved this hotel! The service from start to finish was impeccable, very frendly yet professional at all times. The room itself was a good size and well laid out, I particularly like the fact that there was a day bed next to the full size window, as was the desk. My view was of the ferry terminus and across the bay. It in fact looks exactly like the picture on the webpage - which isn't always the case!.The bed was huge and very comfortable. I thought the layout of the bathroom was quite unique - but I liked this. There are all the accessories you need, including Hermes toiletries - and a TV in the mirror if you wanted to lay in the bath and watch!Things that made this hotel better than others I have stayed in were the small touches in the room - binoculars by the window, lots of free bottles of water by the bed and in the bathroom, fresh fruit, and tea making things - with a relaxing tea bag left when your room was turned down for the night. The Captain's bar was comfy and a pleasant lounge bar, but I found it mainly populated by men, I was travelling with a male colleague so this wasn't a problem but would have probably been a little uncomfortable on my own. The M bar was lively and has great views being on the 20 something floor.This was my first stay (and it was for business) in Hong Kong, I managed to do a little sightseeing and the Mandarin was a good location from which to do this and some shopping.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We stayed in the 600 series of room. The room layout and amenities were were excellent and with thought to smallest detail.What someone may want and was not already there , was produced immediately and with a smile.the staff were warm , efficient and courteous. The automation in the room was sophisticated, yet easy to use, the bathroom was exemplary in style and function.overall a great experience, their spa facilities are worth a visit.If one had to grasp for a fault....it could only be the lack of a view !

<Content>I did not want to leave. The Landmark and its staff are absolute perfection. They have a complementary service where they greet you as soon as you get off the plane and zoom you through the airport. It is very useful if you arrive at 11pm like I did.I stayed at the L600 Superior room and I think it is the best sleep I had in my entire life. The bathroom was like an additional room.Order wonton noodle soup ... I highly recommend it.

<Content>Deserves reputation as one of the best boutique business hotels in the world After staying at a number of good business hotels in Hong Kong I have recently returned to the Landmark Mandarin Oriental. I arrived very early on a Friday and knew that my room wasn't ready. The very professional and friendly receptionist recognized me from a previous visit, offered me the use of the spa facilities to get changed and freshen up. She also arranged for a complimentary breakfast at the exquisite hotel bar restaurant on ground level. I used and enjoyed both, then went to work and returned later in the day.I was given a beautifully appointed room, the luggage was already there and everything else worked to perfection.I highly recommend the hotel and commend its staff to the highest level of service I have seen at any business destination (I travel frequently).

<Content>Pretty good hotel with one major mistake The hotel was pretty commendable in terms of its service, cleanliness, facilities and bedding. The only problem that I had, and a major one at that too, was the layut of the bathroom.When you enter into the room, the bathtub and shower area would be on your right. The sink would be outside the bathtub and shower area, and after the sink, you'd have another room to do your number one and number two. That for me didn't make a lot of sense, I would rather them having it as one big bathroom instead of 3 separate areas. Especially if you are staying with a friend and would like to do all your bathroom business in one place without having to go out.If you don't mind this layout, then this hotel is for you.Btw, love the slippers that they give you. Black for guys and red for girls.

<Content>stunning This is by far one of the best places to stay on Hong Kong Island.We prefer this location to Kowloon which is much more touristy and where soliciting tourists for watches etc is prevalent.The rooms are ultra-modern and the 7 foot tubs are amazing. Glad there's no water shortage in Hong Kong-yet.We arranged for airport pick up-A MUST. It was the best $100 usd we've ever spent.They pick you up at the gate and whisk you through immigration to your waiting luxury car to take you to the hotel.You are then greeted at the front door and taken directly to your room.We were upgraded to a L600 corner room.Service was fantastic. Room was of good size and the lobby bar was modern/hip with great choice of drinks. Hotel was well connected to great shopping, public transportation, eateries, bar scene, and various tourist attractions. You could walk from the hotel all the way to the Star Ferries without venturing outside.Very clean and safe around the hotel. Walked everywhere in Hong Kong.People are polite. Nobody will bother you. We found this Mandarin much nicer than the other and quieter. Would stay here again. Would consider the Four Season's as well.

<Content>Urban Hotel Excellence This is the model of what a luxury urban hotel should be. From the rooms, replete with sophisticated technology, marble-clad bathrooms and sleek furnishings, to the spa, which was large, comprehensive and soothing, this hotel offers its guests nearly every service imaginable. And they do it well, and in great style at that.The Landmark is located, as the name suggests, in the Landmark shopping mall, which is smack dab in the center of Central. You can walk everywhere from this hotel--Soho, the Western District, Victoria Peak, the Airport Express and the Star Ferry are all basically a 10 minute walk. The hotel is located atop the Central MTR station and taxis, if you desire, are outside the front door.The rooms provide a true sanctuary from Hong Kong--they are extremely quiet, spacious and attractive. The bathroom in our L450 Superior room had an hourglass soaking tub, a large rainfall walk-in shower, two sinks and a separate toilet area. Unlike many hotels, the housekeeping is seamless and very generous with the Aromatherapy Associates toiletries. We used the spa, and our services were top notch, though some of the heat experience stations were a bit gimmicky. All in all, though, the spa is a great experience, and compared to US prices, a great deal.We ate breakfast in Amber, and it was well presented and delicious--the same goes for room service.Perhaps the only flaw in this hotel is the concierge, which in general, directed us only on well trodden paths rather than to more local haunts. The pool, though beautiful, lacks sufficient seating/lounging areas.All in all, this is what every urban luxury hotel should strive to emulate.

<Content>Mixed Feelings..... A mixed bag of feelings after staying at this hotel.....pro- nice rooms and bathrooms as mentioned, though for that price, they could have installed jacuzzi baths- superb martinis at MO Bar- beautiful (but very pricy) spa, we had the 4 hours couples treatment- great locationcon- they accidentally rang the fire alarm , jolting us out of bed at 6 am and into the hallway, where some staff then came runnnig false alarm ... something that should not happen at a 5 star property such like this, and the morning / night were ruined- needed to ask for compensation for the above, i.o. the hotel offering it itself- at breakast at Amber on the first day, we were told our room rate only included the continental breakfast, anything else we  would have to pay extra (when paying 5000 HKD for a room, I would usually think it does not matter if I chose the 200, 250 or 280 HKD Breakfast). The 2nd day, we were told everything was included ... confusingAnyway, that fire alarm thingy really set me and my wife off, so we probably wont be staying at MO again.............

<Content>A wonderful mistake I thought I had booked myself into the old Mandarin. Instead, I found myself at the Landmark Mandarin Oriental Hotel (what a mouthful!)The room was huge, high-tech, and immaculate. The only thing missing was a view.But the piece de la resistance was the service: swift and consummately professional, whether it was checking up on a bag that Cathay had temporarily lost, or buying and sending to my room a copy of the Lonely Planet Guide to Bhutan that I had forgot to pack.And I liked the fact that I could walk from my room to the Star ferry without ever having to cross a street in crowded Central.I would definitely stay at the Landmark again!

<Content>Perfect conclusion for Asia journey That was the last hotel on our visit in China and it couldn't be better. The hotel is small, which was a merit for me, after travelling for more than a month and staying in huge crowded hotels . The rooms are big however and very clean. The bathroom was a bliss. OK, you don't really have a view, since the hotel is on the busy street crossing, but that didn't bother me. I have stayed in Hongkong often enough before, also in the hotels with the view. The service was spotless, actually, that was the best service we have ever had in Hongkong, and we have stayed inShangri-La, Hyatt, Interconti, Jia etc.Breakfast served in Mo Bar is very plentiful, the cocktails they serve there in the evening are a must. I usually never drink cocktails, but I became addict to the cocktails at Mo's.The spa is very nice.The location couldn't be better, if you want to do some shopping.I'll definitely stay at landmark next time in Hongkong.

<Content>Good choice for the Shopaholic. The Landmark, in Central, is good hotel if you like to shop or be in the thick of boutique belt. The rooms are large, and have very funky bathrooms -- rainshowers, large circular tubs, and interesting amenities. But there is no view. Tucked on Queens Road Central, beside Harvey Nichols, the hotel is very accesible. The pricing is steep, but service quite good.The few dining outlets -- MO Bar (which becomes the cafe cum breakfast room) and the Amber is made up by the fact that there are dining options a quick walk from the property. The breakfast room at the MO Bar is fine, but its really hard to eat on low tables and chairs. I did not have breakfast at Amber, but had dinner there once and it is excellent.The gym is up to date with the latest Lifefitness equipment, and the Heat Experience -- or their multiple saunas is worth a try.Overall service is good. The concierge was good at getting dinner reservations, and helping pack some things I had bought.Would I recommend this property -- yes, if you like the shopping and access to a great spa.

<Content>Doesn't feel right This is an excellent hotel. Location is good (in the middle of Central), the service is outstanding, the room is very spacious and has a huge bath, it is very clean. I would have given it the highest score if it wasn't for the overall layout/design of the room itself.The overall room feels like a converted office where a prefab bathrromhas been shoehorned.to fit into the space and this took away from the overall experience. The bathroom really dominates the room and the hotel room is more of a bathroom with a hotel room attached to it rather than the other way around.Apart from this it is an excellent hotel. I'm sure many people would not even care/notice, but for me this was sufficient to not book the hotel again.

<Content>What amazing rooms What was good: -The spa!- The room service food.- The location for shopping/eating/drinking.- The bedrooms: large, fantastically appointed and the best bathrooms of any city hotel I've seen.- The service was faultless. We even recieved a call in our room one morning to let us know that someone had noticed our door was slightly ajar and was this intentional...WOW!What wasn't:-The view.- The hotel was small.- The lobby was small and the hotel although the rooms were amazing lacked the grandeur and sense of occasion of larger hotels.- You can't help wondering that if the Landmark is so fantastic, just quite how great the larger Mandarin Oriental in the city would be!

<Content>Fabulous Hotel Stayed here for 3 nights in September, and having travelled a lot and stayed in a lot of 5* hotels, can honestly say this is one of the best!Rooms are simply huge! stayed in a deluxe room, which is worth every penny! Living area is great with plasma tv, and beds are so comfortable. Bathrooms are really specail with a 7ft bath and huge shower, with an overhead rain shower and normal shower function.Staff are extemely friendly and cannot do enough for you.The MO bar is great if a little pricey and one of the best bars i have ever been in.Spa and swimming pool great too.One of the most luxurious hotels i have ever stayed in, and can't wait to go back!

<Content>Best Hotel in Hong Kong We booked a standard room in the Landmark and arrived around 10 a.m., well before the usual check-in time. The polite front desk staff apologized for not having the room ready for us but asked if we would like to upgrade to a suite at no extra cost for the inconvenience!! Now that's what I call service!! The hotel is beautiful--modern, sleek, refined, but much more intimate than many other chain hotels. Our suite was huge, with a king bedroom area, separate living room/business desk area, and a great, circular spa tub and shower bathroom bigger than most people's master bedrooms. All the modern amenities--free internet, TWO plasma screens televisions, flat screen TV in the bathroom, music system sound everywhere, DVD player, etc.--are available. The entire hotel embraces the spa concept, from the rooms to the in-house spa, and I've never stayed in a place that is more peaceful and quiet in a major city--they must have spent quite a bit on soundproofing. The location can't be beat--you're in the Landmark building, which is probably the most expensive shopping mall in Hong Kong. The hotel is just two blocks away from the subway system, and is very convenient for any business traveler. Our package included breakfast, which is pretty good, and located in the chic bar area at the entrance. We've stayed at the Hyatt and the Four Seasons in Hong Kong, but we think the Landmark, with it's tranquil setting and perfect service, is the best.

<Content>Great but not the best First, to make it clear, Landmark MO is a great hotel. However, when compared to the Four Seasons, I think it's just not as good. Stayed at both hotels on recent business trips and here is my take comparing the two1) Location - probably the best part about the landmark MO. A few blocks from LKF makes it convenient for late night partying. Four Seasons is not horrible but it is just a bit more walk to LKF (I usually take a cab in summer given how hot it is)2) Room - the L450 room at MO, despite being quoted just a little smaller than the standard room at the Four Seasons, feels a lot smaller. I think the layout of the room probably is the reason it feels smaller. Not a lot of space next to the two sinks due to having the bathroom door between them. Meanwhile, the Four Seasons room and the bathroom feel a lot more spacious. MO has speakers wired into the ceilings so it's pretty cool for TV/ DVD/ Music. I think FS has slightly nicer furnitures (we are talking about both being high end so it's not like MO's furnitures are crappy)3) View - no comparison. Four Seasons has stunning view while MO's view is really not good at all (maybe w/ the exception of a few very highend rooms)4) Rest of hotel facilities. The outdoor swimming pool at FS overlooks the harbor....simply outstanding. The outdoor space around the pool is also great. MO has none of that. The view of FS also allows it to have restaurants with cooler views.5) Services. Both top notch

<Content>Outstanding stay! The hotel is actually outstanding. Location in HK is the possible best, facilities and services really impeccable, it's considered the coolest in HG. Connection with Landmark Mall is direct. Not to expect huge hall, show-off entrances. Everything perfectly tailored for what's needed for a a perfect stay, both for business and leisure. Also pricing, though high, is well balanced by services and facilities. Strongly recommended!

<Content>flawless stayed here for a weekend getaway, yes, it's possible to have the experience a getaway in the heart of town! once i checked into the hotel, it was as if i entered into another part of town, serene n relaxing with discreet being the key. as with any other stays in any mandarins, the service was excellent. i personally prefer contemporary deco so the room was stunning (n the L450 is what it says it is, around 450 sq ft, bigger any standard size hotel rooms) still trying to figure out how they managed to install a shower n hide all the piping in the middle of the room, with the surrounding walls made mostly of glass. anyway, i definitely wouldn't mind staying there more often!

<Content>Stunning modern hotel with excellent service The hotel is very accessible, excellent downtown location. We stayed in an L600 corner suite- spacious room with an excellent layout. All mod cons- 3 tvs, huge circular bath, aromatherapy associates toiletries- in fact, you can actually trust the pictures on the MO website- what you see is really what you get in this case! My husband and I booked facials in the spa- well worth it as it was the best facial either of us has ever had! The sap itself is stunning- there's free internet access there also. Breakfast was best in the Amber restaurant. It's buffet style in the MO bar but you're perched on bar stools and it was quite crowded the day we ate there. The MO Bar is very chic, the bar area is incredible though service can be slow. Great music with free vodka for girls on thursdays when we were there. Service was consistently excellent elsewhere in the hotel. We checked out the original MO while in town and were glad we choose the more modern Landmark. Shoppers beware- the Landmark is part of a high-end shopping centre of the same name- Gucci is right beside reception...... Bargain wise, the markets are super cheap but the quality matched the price. Any cosmetics but especially SK II which is much cheaper compared to UK/ Ireland prices.

<Content>Modern chic Stayed a couple of nights in early May. It is definitely worth pre-booking the hotel limo and greeting service. Our bags were ready to go whilst we waited in the immigration line, and we were then escorted to the limo suite at the airport to pick up our car. The room was extremely well equipped, and whilst the view wasn't great (other large buildings), the location was perfect for shopping at the Landmark Centre, and access to the MRT and Star Ferry was easy. The MO Bar is a cool place to hang out, and the snacks and cocktails were spot on. Overall the service was very good indeed. Try dinner at Man Wah (upscale Chinese) in the sister Oriental hotel - it was great. Will definitely stay here again...as soon as possible please.

<Content>Best hotel in Hong Kong I travel to HKG monthly. I use to do all my stays at the COnrad, but now stay at the landmark mandarin.Why I think this is the best hotel in HKG?1. First class service - if you take the hotel car from the airport, they have someone meet you at your gate (which is great if you are in gates 40-70). The HKIA staff will drive you to immigration, saves a lot of time.2. They only have brand new S350 or S500 cars which are extremely comfortable.3. The rooms are very spacious, all have new flat panels and the bathrooms are very cool with a nice bathtub to soak in. I love the flat screen tv in the bathroom!Yes, the Four Seasons is great, but location wise, LM is much better. I still find the IFC II/FS area to be a bit inconvenient. Vs. Conrad and Island Shang, LM is in the majors while the others are still in the minor leagues.

<Content>Small and Gorgeous: HK's New Hotel Standard I've stayed at the LMO twice -- once in late 2006, and most recently at the end of January 2007 -- and may I just saw, Wow! The LMO is in a three-way tie with the Peninsula and Four Seasons as my favorite HK hotel. For my first stay, I booked a suite deal package for the L900 suite, the hotel's largest (and worth the extra HK$), for me and a friend. The package included round-trip airport transfers in the hotel's Mercedes S-Class, breakfast, and other amenities, all for about HK$3000 less per day than the regular, non-package suite-only rate. The airport pickup service is perfect: as others have described, you're met at your gate, seated in an electric cart, and whisked past all the other deplaning passengers to immigration. HK's airport is already the world's best airport, and the LMO meet-and-greet service makes a pleasant airport experience all the more so. Arrival: The LMO is completely hidden in a tasteful but otherwise anonymous high-rise building that forms part of the new Landmark Centre complex. Upon pulling into the hotel's short drive, however, the MO's service and unique touches begin. Glass doors are opened by very smart-looking attendants, and the already-famous golden staircase greets you. Upstairs, the reception area is small and beautiful, and given that the hotel only has 113 rooms, I don't think there's ever more than a one-person wait. I was, of course, greeted by name as soon as I approached the receptionist, and she quickly escorted me to my suite, which was on the the top (15th) floor. L900 Suite: And what a suite -- the entry foyer is a black-marble catwalk flanked by smooth white and grey stones. The bedroom areas is to the left, the huge bathroom in the center, and the living/dining room and office to the right. Everything in the suite bespoke careful attention to the principles of fung shui, first-rate acoustics, and the best possible materials (dark woods, marble, glass, stone, fabrick) everywhere. As others have noted, the views from whichever room or suite you take are of other office building; after all the LMO is in perhaps the busiest section of Central. The in-room technology is of the highest standard and excels that found in the Pen or FS. The bathroom alone is sufficient reason to book the L900 or one of the L600 rooms: 7-foot round marble tub, with large, separate glass booths for both the toilet and rainforest shower. Fabulous. The A/V system in the suite (and all of the rooms, I suppose) caters to every need or desire; my friend and I particularly enjoyed the FTV and Amsterdam HD fashion channel (free; other HD channels offered for pay-per-view). Dining: My friend and I only had breakfast in the Amber restaurant (included in our suite package), and it was excellent. The food was copious and uniformly fresh and delicious, and Amber's atmosphere at one invigorating and relaxing. We loved the thousands of soft-gold metal reds suspended from the ceiling.Spa and pool: The LMO's Spa is the best I've seen thus far in a hotel: all manner of hot-and-cold water treatments, from a large-yet-intimate hammam to scented arctic showers to a tropical rainforest (which, oddly, features only a short trickle of water once every 5 minutes, preceded by a soft red glow from a sculpture that looks as though it were purloined from a old Trader Vic's restaurant). As with everything in the LMO, the materials of which the Spa is fashioned are all of the highest quality and maximum aesthetic appeal. During my first stay, there was no swimming pool, but the LMO had put one in before my second stay. The pool is the only feature of the hotel that is not superb: It appears to have been hastily installed and looks like what one would expect to see in the basement of a 3- or 4-star hotel. The pool is a decent size (though not 25 metres), but it's just a plain cement bowl with minimal decoration. No matter; it serves to make one's return to the rest of the LMO all that much more welcome.L450 room: Just a few words on the basic LMO room, in which I stayed last time, the L450 Superior: in any other hotel, this would be a top-of-the-line room; in the LMO, however, it's a wonderful bargain. It wasn't even a let-down after the L900 suite, as I was by myself this time and found the L450 more than adequate for all of my needs. Rather than providing a full seperate living/dining room, the L450 includes a mini-seating area next to the bed and in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows (which extend into the bathroom area). The bathroom was still very luxurious, with a lovely hourglass-shaped tub replacing the round version found in the larger room and suites. Otherwise, the smaller room was delightful, with lighter woods and the full range of audio-video options (including a small, perfectly placed for tub viewing LCD TV in the bathroom) I'd encountered in the suite.Bottom line: Hotels in Hong Kong are expensive, even by large Asian city standards, so why not spend your money on something really special? The LMO is a rare find: a small luxury hotel that offers everything its much larger high-end competitors have and then some. The LMO is very modern, so if you want more traditional European or Chinese decor and ambience, you'll probably not like the LMO as much as the Pen or Ritz-Carlton. But if you like ultramodern aesthetics combined with timeless Asian service standards and attention to detail, check out the LMO first. Enjoy.

<Content>An Amazing New Year's Eve at the LMO! So many others before me have attested in great detail to the beautiful atmosphere and extraordinary service at the Landmark Mandarin Oriental that I cannot do much more than add my wholehearted accord to the deservedly glowing reviews. Our very first moments promised an incredible week-long stay. Eva, the kind and ultra-professional front desk agent, efficiently checked us in and then showed us to our room, going through the many amenities with us 鈥?a delightful arrangement I had never experienced before. My room, the smaller of the two types available, was large, comfortable and amazingly outfitted with the latest in technology. I was happy to find a leather box with all the cables I would need to connect my laptop to the internet and my ipod to the fully-integrated entertainment system. The large, wall-mounted flat screen-tv served as the interface for all the entertainment components and was a delight to watch. The bathroom was sleek, modern and stocked with every amenity available, from toothbrushes and toothpaste to deodorant and q-tips; perfect for forgetful packers like myself. The staff was some of the best I鈥檝e experienced anywhere. Each was welcoming, friendly, and managed to be casual in conversation while at all times respectful and service-oriented. We dined at Amber on New Year鈥檚 Eve and could not have been more pleased with the experience. A James Bond/Casino Royale theme was well played out and everyone had a fantastic time. In a room full of revelers, we received remarkably individualized service throughout our delicious nine-course meal and rang-in 2007 in an unforgettable celebration with guests and staff. The next morning, Amber had been completely restored to a calming environment where we enjoyed a wonderful breakfast. The Landmark Mandarin Oriental brings the legendary level of comfort set by her older sister to a new generation of travelers, and played an integral part in making our New Year鈥檚 trip to Hong Kong one of the best in recent memory. We enthusiastically recommend it to all within earshot, and cannot wait to go back. Enjoy your high tea at the Peninsula, but stay at the LMO!

<Content>Heaven on earth with style. From the moment i steped out of the plane from Paris to the day i left the hotel, the Landmark experience was the most extraordinary one i ever had in a 5 stars hotel. The escort from the desembarking jetway, the staff (including the room amanager) waiting for me at the hotel entrance, the light breakfast displayed in the room before my arrival, the in room check in, the concierge efficiency...all was perfect. All seemed easy. The L600 room was spotless, the SPA was amazing of tranquility, simplicity. Breakfast at Amber restaurant was fantastic.Everyday a new goody was placed in the room, from chocolate box, to cherries. Personal touches with style all the time.That was perfection. Leaving the Landmark was my only disapointement.

<Content>A perfect 10 How could I describe paradise found? The hotel was exquisite. We opted to utilize their airport transport service, and we were met right by the gate by a staff member, and whisked through the airport on a golf cart through customs. Our luggage was the first one out and we were escorted to a luxurious Mercedes. A hotel staff member was waiting for us at the curb of the hotel, and we were immediately led to our beautiful corner room on the top floor. It was almost like a dream.The room itself was beautiful. The d茅cor was clean, modern and elegant, and the bathroom was positively sumptuous with a huge round bathtub. And everything was spotlessly clean. The hotel is also ideally located right in the middle of Central. We were within easy walking distance to the Star Ferry, the MTR station was right next door and there is a maze of beautiful malls with high end stores attached to the hotel.The service was exemplary and highly professional throughout our stay. The staff was always friendly and courteous and they often greeted us by name. We also had the opportunity to use their spa, which was stunning. There are separate areas for men and women, and there are several different sauna rooms, rain and mist showers, jet pools and a beautiful relaxation room.Breakfast was included in our room price, and it was a buffet extravaganza. First of all, the room itself on the ground floor is gorgeous, and there were all kinds of hot and cold delights awaiting us. We could have a typical 鈥淏ritish鈥?breakfast with baked beans, scrambled eggs, sausage and hash, or a more Chinese breakfast with various dim sum items and congee. Lots of different breads, pastries as well as fruits, smoked fish and veggies were available as well.In all my travels, I have never given a perfect 10 to a hotel, but the Landmark Mandarin surely deserves it.

<Content>It doesn't get better than this. From the moment you arrive in Hong Kong the exceptional service begins. Even without a hotel transfer the staff meet you at the gate and ensure you breeze through the airport. Check-in is swift and courteous. The deluxe rooms are superbly appointed with exceptional attention to detail. Make sure you check out the spa, one of the best I have ever encountered. This is the ideal hotel for business and well located in Central Hong Kong. Unbeatable!

<Content>Excellent modern, funky hotel for young people! The spa rooms are bathrooms with a room! Room d茅cor was very modern and stylish. The perfume scents in the corridors and in the rooms are delicious. The technology gadgets on the rooms are super and the rooms are very well appointed. Service is outstanding. If you like stylish modern rooms this an excellent option with outstanding service. The location is great from the night scene, waking distance from the best clubs and bars in Hong Kong.

<Content>Traumatic The trauma involved was having to leave. This hotel is the best I have stayed in, anywhere in the world. It's even better than the original Mandarin Oriental a couple of blocks away. The service is different - it's not as olde-worlde as the original MO, but still light years ahead of most other places. We had a Landmark Suite - which was not cheap at 鈧?00 a night, but - honestly - it was the best money I've ever spent on a hotel room. The room was sumptuous - enormous; flat screen TVs; rainfall showers; Aromatherapy Associates toiletries; 3 different kinds of robe; gorgeous bed; fruit; the works. There is no Harbour or City view at the hotel, but that's more than made up for by the rooms, spa, bar, service and location. Book it.

<Content>Wow I stayed here back in January and am still smiling. The staff were incredibly efficient and very accomodating. Check-in was a breeze, the whole thing completed in our room in minutes. The hotel was very responsive to email enquiries and requests from the UK. I can't fault it. It would always be nicer if you could get a bargain but you pay for what you get. It's a great Central location. Efficient, Clean, Competent, Comfortable and to cap it all I proposed to my girlfriend in their fantastic Mo Bar and she said yes. I will deifnitely go back if ever in that part of the world again.

<Content>brilliant hotel There has been a lot of hype about this hotel and that has largely been warranted. from this entrance to the rooms this hotel simply works. The rooms are huge: mine contained a bed area, a sitting area and a massive bathroom, all of which contained plasma televisions. There is also an abundance of useful technology including power operated blinds and an intelligent lighting system. At the time there was no swimming pool, something that will change in September, but I did make use of the free areas of the spa, containg steam room, sauna, hydrotheraphy pool and scented showers. i never use spas but this was absolutely wonderful and very relaxing after a busy day in Hong Kong. The restaurant was impressive but it must be said very expensive. Another nice touch that the hotel included was being transported from the plane to the passport check on a bugy. This just highlights the attention to detail that the hotel pays and it is really the superb service that makes this hotel. If you don't mind the lack of views I highly recomend this hotel.
