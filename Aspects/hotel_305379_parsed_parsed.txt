<Content>Pleasant experience 2nd time around I reviewed this Hotel from my stay in Oct 2005. We visited HK again 3 years later, this time in Nov 2008. My wife and I (both in our 30s) stayed here from Nov 5-Nov 13. We picked it again since we liked the location of the place.We booked directly from the Hotel website and we got a decent deal since were were staying for 7 consecutive nights. We let them know in advance that we would be arriving rather late..around 10 pm or so.There is a paid private shuttle bus you can take from the airport to several hotels (this one included). It runs every 45 mins up until 10 pm. The price for the ticket was about $20 per person USD and the ride would take an hour since we would stop at other hotels first to drop people off. Instead you can take a cab from HKG to this Hotel. At around 10 pm on a weeknight, there is no traffic so it takes about 35-40 mins to get here and costs about $30-$35 for the trip.The hotel front lobby is kind of small and this hotel is quite popular, so at times it can get crowded with groups of people arriving and departing. They checked us in quickly into a non smoking floor. We intentionally chose 2 twin beds since this will give you a better night sleep than trying to sleep in a tiny double bed. The room is small, but this is typical in HK since there is no space anyway. Clean room, clean bathroom, good service. They participate in a 'Green Program' where you they do not change the sheets unless you specify by leaving a card on the bed.Since the hotel is next to the 'Temple Street Market', you may hear droning noises outside the window till late at night...until 1 am perhaps. If you're tired, you'll sleep thru this...it's like a constant din in the background.The location is excellent in that you are right next to the Temple street market, 2 blocks from Nathan Road, 3 blocks from the start of the Jade market, 3 blocks from the MTR station.We did not eat or drink at this hotel since it is pricier than going down the street to grab a meal. If you get out the front door and start going Right (away from Nathan Road), you will find a 'Wellcome' grocery store where you can buy fresh fruit, produce, larger bottles of water for cheap, sandwiches etc. The hotel itself does NOT have free internet at all. But if you bring your own laptop, then you can use the HK Government free hotspots close by. It's not as convenient as your room, but still pretty good. Actually, right down the street, you will find the Kowloon Public Library. Simply take your laptop, walk in and park your butt in the kids section (first floor). No one minds and it's fun checking email while little Chinese kids around you are messing around with their story books. It's also surprisingly quiet.The Hotel staff speaks good English, is responsive and helpful. You can exchange money at the front desk and make change to get smaller bills too. Cabs are easily available. The nearest Metro station is the Yau Ma Tei which is about 3 blocks away and is easy to get to. So you can access the entire city from here. If you have big bags with you, it may be hassle to take the Metro from the airport to the Yau Ma Tei station...lots of line changes in the middle...stairs etc.The only thing I wish was better was the elevators. They are quite small so you can only fit so many people in there. Sometimes when large groups of guests arrive, you may have to wait a while to get into the elevator to get to your room.Do not expect a large room in HK. I took a look at apartments when I was there, and they have 500 sq ft apartments going for $2K US per month.For this hotel, you're getting a deal....paying under $100 US per night, getting to stay in the center of town.

<Content>Punishing claustrophobia We were told by brochures etc and in photos that this was a great hotel..the first thing is we booked a non smoking double and got a smoking twin..ok so we stayed the first night as they did not understand much english at the front desk. Second day we were given a non smoking room double..it was smaller than my bathroom and we could not move in the room without one person sitting the bed..the television was so high up and close to the head of the bed as the room was small could not see it without tilting head back. Toilet did not work and bathroom was old and grotty.No open window just air con that worked so well you were like a raisin by the morning..the claustrophobic had to stand by the open door of the room all night it was very very small room. Flight got held over so had to stay two more nights..same room order, but it cost us more and we actually got a much bigger room..so don't complain or you will be put in the punishment corner rooms..on the very last day we got a english speaking paper delivered under the door. Staff here either don;t speak english or are very limited...they don; understand that the toilet does not work (flush)I thought it was just me, a huge Aussie (size 8) until two other ladies without prompting or comment from me, both Asian and very small commented how tiny the rooms were and that they had looked bigger in the brochure..also the lack of fresh air..would consider paying for a better hotel..these small rooms cost us 1200 HK dollars each..and we really felt unwanted.

<Content>Did not like it I stayed for 4 nights and seriously did not enjoy it. Room is just too minuscule and service is not very kind. Don't know what kind of person would design a hotel room like that and think that a guess would feel good. I need at least room to place my bags, and there was not any. Basically you need to sleep hugging your luggage. It is well located though. But the vecinity is not the best.

<Content>Budget hotel I had booked 3 nights stay in this hotel via a travel agency in Singapore. The price is ok for a tourist 3 star hotel. I had requested via my agent for a triple bed room. However, upon arrival, it was actually a double single bed with a foldable bed. And the room is superbly tiny. There's no walking space once you had brought your luggage into the room. Thanks goodness, we didn't bring a lot of luggages. The ensuite toilet with shower facility is small too. Wash basin is tiny. Expect splash of water on the floor when you wash your face. Shower curtain has the old fungi stain. Not a pleasant sight if you're the fussy type. Thankfully, the room is clean. It has a small tv, mounted on the wall, an electric water pitcher and the necessary toiletries. Location wise is good. Within walking distance are the Temple Street night market and the Jade Market. The MTR Yau Ma Tei is also nearby. I wouldn't recommend for family with children. Room is too small. Couple should be ok.

<Content>Very convenient hotel... Before we booked for the hotel, read many negative reviews on the size of the hotel. However, we chose this hotel due to the feedback on the location of the hotel.Indeed, the location is really convenient. Minutes to the Yau Ma Tei MTR. And there are many food/ cafe nearby the hotel. Temple Street Market is minutes away too.Yes, the rooms are small, however, since there are so many things to see and do in Hong Kong, you will hardly be in the hotel room, so the small size of the room is not a problem for us.

<Content>No frills and just chill 'Just came home from a business trip in Hongkong. We stayed here at the Dorsett Seaview fo the reason that it is one of the in demand hotel from my clients. Though i'm a travel agent/tour organizer in the Philippines, i never got the chance in staying here. The rooms were small but one thing i was impresses is the cleanliness and affordable price of this hotel. Considering that i have a business meeting and did not stay too much with the hotel, I could say Dorsett Seaview is a pretty much a good option. Also, flight schedule monitor is very recognizable at the lobby, in which case making it a hassle free one for its patron. The location is also an asset. (situated near the night market and MTR station). Friendly tip: bring your own umbrella! My dad borrowed umbrella and the front desk officer were very rude and told us you buy!. We were thankful he's (front desk officer) not in the Philippines. Otherwise, he'll expect some trouble and body aches. Kudos to the management of Dorsett Seaview for a job well done (except to that guy... here's my message: please do not come to the Philippines and something bad will hapen to you).

<Content>Pretty good Hotel Like many reviewers have posted before the rooms are extremely small so therefore if you're looking for a regular to big size hotel room it is not ideal. Then again when you go to Hong Kong you are not going to be staying at the Hotel, so you basically just need a place to sleep which is excellent. The room was always clean and the service from the front desk was excellent. Literally 5 minutes away from Yau Ma Tei MTR station, and really close to the police station, mcdonalds, many amazing restaurants, footsteps away from Temple Street and Nathan Road. This was the best place in regards to location (which is excellent), cost, and quality. For those travellers who are taller, it may be difficult to stay here because Im 5'9 and I just fit on the bed length wise, so if you are over 5'9 be prepared to have your feet hang over the bed. Other then the size of the room I have no other complaints. I will defintely go back to this hotel due to its location and price.

<Content>Tiny Rooms, Great Location The night market is right outside the hotel. The surrounding area is great, a short walk to the MTR and great location. The rooms are SMALL. I read reviews of the hotel before we booked it since we needed a place to stay when we came back from Thailand and noticed many reviews indicating the small rooms but I thought it couldn't be THAT small and this had the cheapest rate available. I booked a room with two beds. The room was SO small...there was absolutely no room to put both of our luggages. We had to put it in the entryway (which was very small to begin with) to open it up, my friend and I each taking turns. There was no walking room thereafter. We eventually realized there was a funky stench underlying a bleach smell and asked to be moved to be another room. The front desk was really helpful in moving us, but they were only able to move us to one double bed. This room doesn't get bigger. This is a cheap hotel but there's really NO space and it's confining. You may find other hotels at around the same rate and same area as we stayed in another hotel before Thailand.

<Content>Good food around If you are on budget this is the place; although I must admit the hotel rooms are pretty small- no way a couple can walk without brushing shoulders. As mentioned by other reviewers you might find the tv is oddly positioned (if you need to watch due to jetlag, etc or you are trapped in the hotel like me due to the monsoon). It is possible to suffer backaches from sleeping in the soft bed. However generally the room is considered clean. Another plus point, the staff are patient and helpful. Due to its great location, it is easy to find great food along the Temple street located behind the hotel; check out local stir-fried seafood and hotpots @ Shang Kei and fishball noodle stall opposite Shang Kei (order the side dish- fried fish skin along with the noodle soup). A few more steps, you will reach the Nathan road which stretches from mong kok to tsim sha tsui; together with yaumatei (where Dorsett seaview is) forms the happening Yau Tsim Mong.

<Content>Reasonable for Hong Kong Overall - average missing out on above average. Ideal for short stays - maximum 10 days. Ideal for independent tourists who are not bothered about mini bars or perks. 6 out of 10. I have been to Hong Kong 15 times and with the right changes - asthetically inside and outside (uninviting) this hotel has great potential for any owner AND for visitors. THE POSITIVEDorsett Seaview was reasonable in cost terms insofar as Hong Kong hotels are concerned. Working out at around 42 GBP, 96 AUD, 56 EUR or 85 USD per night. Only five minutes walk from the Yau Ma Tei MTR station which has links into the centre. Ideal for exploring Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. Ideal for taxis if you really need them. Nathan Road has excellent bus routes. Shuttle bus service to Kowloon Airport Express Railway Station downtown. Friendly staff and room cleaned/stocked daily. Busy area seemed safe most of the time. CCTV system, calendar of events and weather report on all floors.I would recommend this hotel. THE NEGATIVEHotel could do with a major investment to do it up particularly as hotels in Hong Kong are few in number in this particular market. I agree that the decor needs to be overhauled - if only to make it update. Drab bedsheets replaced by funky ones would make the hotel more fun - particularly after a 12 hour flight. Facilities were clean however shower curtains need to be replaced. Bedroom area was sufficient however the shower/bathroom areas needs to be updated and regularly deep cleaned. Internet available however uncompetitive. Cheaper to travel down to Kowloon by MTR and have a full hour on the internet. Prices advertises should also include tax. Not that I watch much television but the set was poorly located. The information guide in the room for the hotel amenities needs overhauling.

<Content>Awful Rooms From the outside, you can sense that this hotel is pretty grim on the inside. The ground floor reception looks reasonable enough but the rooms are dreadful. Not only are they small with beds pushed alongside the walls, the wallpaper was peeling off , stained and gone off colour. A 14colour TV positioned in one corner, very little space to move around. The room rates advertised on the website is a rip off and I would not advise anyone to stay here. There are better hotels for the same amount of money. The only plus point about this hotel is that the tourist attractions are close by such as Temple Street and Jade Markets along with the MTR tube station a short 5-10 miunte walk away.

<Content>if you like the night market... you can stay in this hotel, but.. if you like night markets, and buying in bargains.. you may consider dorset, but... with your bags plus additional items to be placed inside your dorsett room(i don't think it will fit in)....the room is very small... if its your first time in hongkong, just try other hotel like bp intl or stanford hillview but not dorsett... or else you will be disappointed.

<Content>Terribly Small Hongkong hotels are all basically pretty expensive and small but Dorsett Seaview was really extreme! There was no space to walk and there is only a small bed and tv. But at least you can sleep in it and bathe in it, but there are definitely much better deals out there! If you do not intend to spend much time in the hotel then maybe you wouldn't mind its minute size but its still not worth it! And of course there is no sea view, just some roads maybe.

<Content>Don't Stay There I want to report that this hotel was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I paid $US180 for a room which should have cost no more than $US80 at the most. On arrival at the hotel, there was a sign out the front offering rooms for $HK398!!! There was no one to help with the bags. I complained about the room, but all rooms are the same.The hotel is old, there is paint and wall paper coming off the walls. The carpets are stained. However, the worst thing is the size of the rooms. It is almost impossible to turn around in these rooms, unless you are a very small person, say under 5 feet tall and very narrow. There was one very dark window, a roller blind which did not keep out the light, no tissues, nothing in the mini bar. Bed linen was of a poor quality as was the mattress on the bed. In the room there was no space for the case.I felt that the hotel also posed a fire risk, being so poky and tight.The breakfast was NOT included in $US180!!! The breakfast was absolutely terrible too. It cost $HK55 for a buffet, I asked to have Continental, because all I could eat was toast and tea. That was not possible. There was no yoghurt, virtually no fruit compote, only one jam.In every aspect this hotel is CHEAP AND NASTY. It must be classified as a TWO STAR property.I had booked the hotel on the internet and was required to pay BEFORE getting there. Hong Kong was very crowded at this time. Therefore, I had no way to get my money back and the hotel is just laughing about the money they are making. I hope to spread the word on other web sites about this hotel. It is a disgrace.

<Content>Best place on a budget My friend and I stayed at the Dorsett Seaview Hotel for 3 nights. It was a comfortable stay because the hotel was conveniently located near a MTR station. It was right in the middle of everywhere and if you're not too scared of walking, you can go through the whole Nathan road and enjoy the shops that line the road.There's no sea side view in the Dorsett Seaview Hotel, but it's right in front of a small park and the area is pretty much safe. There is a night market nearby and the sounds from the streets were muted and didn't keep us up all night. We didn't get to eat at the hotel and the arrangement was to have breakfast outside the hotel, so we had Mc Donald's every morning. There are a lot of Chinese restaurants in the area that are reasonably priced so it's easy to get a bite.

<Content>Satisfied with it The Hotel was indeed small, as I expected it to be. But luckily, our rooms were ok...clean, no foul smell, cold (thermostat is adjustable anyway). There were bathrooms with showers, there are those with tubs. Avoid the tubs if you are tall coz the attached shower is quite low. There were only two elevators and I found no stairs except for the emergency probably. Since my family were placed in the 2nd and 3rd floors only, it would have been better to take the stairs sometimes if they were available to avoid the wait. Considering the affordable price, it was really worth it and the location is good, too.

<Content>Cr*p place...waste money in a hostel - it would be a better stay ok. where do i start, maybe the tiny room where you cant even leave your bag outside the tiny wardrobe? or shoudl i start with teh stained bathroom/toilet? how about the bedroom itself...with the peeling off wallpaper and the stained, i mean really dirty stained curtains that you would not want to touch without gloves or disinfectant? maybe i wont even bother with the carpet!i read about this place on here before i booked it and paid for it, and either the people stayed in a palacial rooms better then mine or they are really really really not fussy abotu where they stayed. i hd to bare the place since i was in a rush to book somewhere 'cheap'. you can get better places off the people you meet in hong kong liek for half the price.i dotn write reviews, but i feel it is a benefit to others to warn about this place. seriously it was that much of a disgusting room. yes, so the satff was nice and the location was ok, but who goes to hotel to chat with teh staff and in hong kong, taxi is cheap so why bother with a slum to spend your night in. they say, hotel is just to sleep, but hotel also sets your mood for a nice holiday, like they say, a happy day starts with a smile. a happy holiday starts with a nice hotel!you might read, as i have, how chinese peopel being little so you can understand the small room - well if you aint a chinese or a tiny person, why you want to stay in such a small room? seriously, dont waste your money on this place! yes i agree, some people are givign glowing review, but think about it - do you want to take a chance with your holiday hotel where it could be a room bit more decent then the one i stayed in...or JUST LIKE MINE!??? you been warned, but love to hear if i was wrong, then maybe if i am soooo desperate i can book next time your room, so give me teh room number you stayed in!

<Content>comfortable coffin this is the letter i wrote to the manager:To manager:PLEASE DO NOT RATE YOUR HOTEL (3) STARS! it will NEVER be three stars. i stay in your hotel for 5 nights. i will NEVER consider your hotel again. your hotel not only sucks and expensive, it is also extremely overrated overseas. if you want to consider what a three star hotel is please go to macau's Presidential hotel. that is genuinely a three star hotel... i do not think your hotel should get even a single star, maybe a 1/2 star.Bads things:(1) your reception people need to be retrain. they are not qualified, especially the lady with the glasses.(2) tiny rooms(3) your fees are extremely exorbitant! internet access fee was a rip off. you also charge 10 HKD for having luggage held per day. i have never seen or heard hotels charging this fee.(4) you don't provide adequate toilet tissue.(5) you charge $5 HKD per call. please, you need to stop abusing your customers.sincerely,fou foucc: Hong Kong Business Bureau

<Content>Cheap (and small), but cheerful! Ok so we were prepared for a small room having read the reviews, but as the man said this is Hong Kong... Although the room is small, and i mean tiny, it was on the whole clean and functional. Basic amenities included, i.e tea./coffee maker, tv etc. Even smaller en suite attached. Reception staff could perhaps be a little more jolly but were at least attentive during check out. Although not as central as we would have liked, the hotel was within 3 minute walk from nearest MTR station (Yau ma tei). If you have the legs for it ,you can walk to harbourfront at Tsim tsa tsui in 25 minutes and gasp in amazement at the glorious skyline that is central Hong Kong. Get there for 8pm and witness an extravaganza of neon lights and lasers being cast from above the skyscrapers.Hong Kong is an astonishing place ,and if low on budget would consider staying at the Dorsett seaview again.

<Content>Comfortable Value An excellent little hotel - part of Hong Kong's Dorsett Group and better than its sister hotel (Dorsett Olympic) that I have previously stayed in.It is in a busy, crowded, colorful part of Kowloon - very close to the MTR and many bus routes including the Airport bus route A21. There is a big street market all around the hotel.The room - while very small - was very comfortable with everything in it. I highly recommend this hotel for a couple of nights.

<Content>A Shocker! Smallest place I have ever seen. So small two people and two bags didnt fit. The restaurant which looks good in their pictures is nothing like it with food not only horrible but strange. The bed which felt like an ironing board gave me back problems for the 10 day stay. The service overall was average. Location is good but thats about it.

<Content>Small Room It was one of the smallest rooms I have ever stayed in! There was hardly enough space for two people to walk without having to rub elbows. The bed seemed to be a enlarged super single although it was specified as a queen-size. The corridor was cramped, as well as the lift and the lobby. The only consolation was that the staff were friendly and helpful, and that the location was great; with Temple Street directly next to the hotel and night markets galore opp the road. It was located in the heartlands of HongKong; good if you like cheap shopping and just mingling in the HongKong lifestyle and food. Recommended if you are on a tight budget or don't mind the room size.

<Content>Warning! There is NO SEAVIEW. Don't Stay. After viewing the hotel's website (but not reading Tripadvisor at the same time for past guest's views) and noting the good location, we decided to stay at The Dorsett Seaview Hotel as part of the last leg of our journey.Firstly, the deluxe room was exceptionally small (nothing like the photos on their website), smoke filled and unclean and there was no SEAVIEW as we expected. When I enquired of the reception staff as to an alternative room with a seaview I was told nothing available and the reception staff were unhelpful.I agree with the negative comments provided by other guests and I would not go back let alone recommend (for any price) the hotel to any of our friends.

<Content>Nothing Special I was there along with my fiancee in the month of October. The room was so small that we felt suffocated. It was cramped up with the twin bed, side table, main table with a small TV on it. Dont think of spending 90HKD and watching one of the movies. Its not worth it. Did i say carry your laptop? Oh, incase if you are running short on your digital camera space and want to download the pictures onto your flashdrive, dont try the business center. A very small room, with one PC (Running Windows 98). Was a nightmare. Happened to go to their Karaoke? The place is reserved after 9pm for their gambling stuff. No tables can be occupied after 9pm. Location is good, but if you want to try chinese food, please stay away from those restaurants. McDonalds is walkable distance, with tasteless food. Gosh, terrible stay altogether. Only best part was when we were out of the hotel, moving in city.Receptionist at the hotel cant speak in proper english. You cannot change the rooms. Elevators (2 in no.) are small. By the way, i could not have any view of the sea from any of their floors. Why is it called Seaview??Yau Ma Tei is flooded with lot of hotels, and with our experience, no more Dorsett. My fiancee almost broke up with me, coz of the hotel. We would not want to go back to Hong Kong just coz of this living experience. All the best to folks who wud want to spend and live in Dorsett.

<Content>Good Location, good price, hotel - o.k. Hotel rooms very small, but hey you're only sleeping there. Great location near to Temple Street Markets. Staff were helpful, no complaints. The bar on the top floor was enlightening and hence we drank out most evenings. We only stayed for 2 nights and felt the hotel met our requirements as a cheap hotel in a good location.

<Content>Waste of your money It is very hard to think anything good about this hotel. Rooms are so small that you can barely open your luggage there. If you are smoker you will love the place since you can enjoy the smoke of your neighbours, but maybe that is just how the air conditioning is supposed to work. Seaview Lounge, which is the hotel's notorious restaurant, only sells some greasy substance which they call food. But if you want to see as much Hong Kong as possible during your vacation maybe this hotel is then good choice since you won't spend your valuable holiday laying in the hotel room.Stay away. You can find a lot of better places for same price.

<Content>Worth the price. I stayed at Dorsett Seaview along with a group of three other friends from the 11th-13th July and from 14th-18th July. (The night of the 13th, we spent in China.) (:Location (5/5)The location was excellent. There was a night market (Temple Street Night Market) practically at our doorstep, plus several other eateries such as Hui Lau Shan, Mc'Donalds and other smaller outlets around the hotel. Yau Ma Tei MRT Station was only two streets away, hence making travelling around Hong Kong a breeze. Mongkok (Ladies Street Night Market) was also within 10-15 minutes walking distance.Cleanliness (4/5)The carpets were mostly clean, the sheets were white, and the blankets were stain-less. The bathroom was dry and clean when we first entered the room as well.A heating flask and a metallic flask for storing hot water that was provided in each room wasn't that clean, though. My friend had to scrub the heating flask a few times before it was reasonably clean enough for storing water. Whereas the metallic flask was rusty, hence we avoided using it.Room Amenities (3/5)There was a small television set in the corner, but it didn't work. (Either that, or we didn't know how to operate it.) The room we (my friend and I) stayed in for the initial half of our trip had wooden blinds that were rather difficult to use. Just shutting the blinds at night took us almost ten minutes because it was constantly getting jammed. Likewise, it was tough to raise the blinds in the morning because the whole thing just kept falling back down. Thankfully, the room we stayed in for the second half of the trip had curtains instead of blinds.The bathroom was tiny, but I didn't really mind since I don't take up much space anyway. Although it was hard to enter the bathroom and shut the door without getting my toe caught in between the bathroom floor and the base of the door.Room itself was small as well. However, it wasn't small to the extent of inducing claustrophobia because there was somehow a rather cosy feeling about it. Nicely furnished. Quite 'zen-like', in my frank opinion.Cups and free sachet drinks were provided in the rooms - but no teaspoons. So we had to swirl the cup like a conical flask in a chemistry lab just to ensure that the powdered drinks dissolved properly in the hot water.Free Breakfast (3.5/5)Food was so-so, I guess. Perhaps it is because I am easily satisfied. At least it is edible, not like some flea-infested cafeterias we can find on the streets.However, there wasn't much variety in the food. The same old pancakes, bacon, ham, sausages, porridge and cornflakes every single day - for six days we stayed there. The pancakes had a rather rubbery texture, so at times I was unsure whether I was biting into a deflated tyre or a pancake. Otherwise, the rest of the food was average.Reception (5/5)VERY friendly. Always ready to serve with a smile, and a tone that puts you at ease almost immediately. They were well versed in English as well, so I didn't really have any trouble communicating with them while checking-in and checking out. The process of checking in and out was also a relatively fast procedure, seeing how efficient most of the staff was.IN A NUTSHELLFor the price, and considering that this is merely a 2-3 star hotel, I was pleasantly surprised for the most part. I've refered to some of the reviews regarding this hotel on this site prior to my departure and was bracing myself for the worst upon checking in, but the worst never came. Perhaps I was just lucky.Either way, I'll definitely stay at this hotel again - should I return to Hong Kong in the near future. (:

<Content>verrry small rooms, near night markets My husband, mom and sister stayed at this hotel for three nights. If it were not inconvenient for my mom to transfer to another hotel, I would have transferred right away! The rooms were very small. There was no closet to hang our clothes. There was a tiny desk but the telephone took up most of its space! When we were in the toilet, we had to make sure that the door was locked otherwise we we would have been injured if someone opened it. On the other hand, the rooms were clean. The staff was courteous. The location is ok if you are into night markets. Its near the mtr stations too.

<Content>Look Elsewhere We chose the Dorsett Seaview because the price was right and our last minute trip to Hong Kong during October's Canton Trade Show left few options. I liked the fact that it was a distance from the craziness of Tsim Sha Tsui but, being only two subway stops away, was close enough to the Star Ferry and other services. Its proximity to the Jade Market and Temple Street Night Market interested me. But the hotel is really very bad. Rooms are extremely small, and I'm used to small European hotel rooms. Carpeting and drapes should have been replaced years ago. There is no closet, just a bar on the wall to hang your clothes. We paid an extra (100 HKD/night) for a deluxe room which based on the photos from their website has a small desk/sitting area. The room we got had nothing of the sort, and when we asked at the desk we were told that the rooms were all the same and that deluxe meant you were on a higher floor than the standard rooms. So either their website misrepresents the rooms or the staff was not honest. On the plus side, the top (19th) floor has an inexpensive breakfast buffet (55 HKD) with a good view of the area, Yau Ma Tei subway stop is two blocks away, and one gets a local perspective of Hong Kong while being only two stops from Tsim Sha Tsui chaos.

<Content>Smoker's Haven This hotel is only a few blocks from the subway  night market. The room itself is clean but small with outdated furnishings, especially the bathroom. Housekeeper is quite stingy with toilet paper as sometimes we'd only get half a roll. We requested for a Non-Smoking room, but all room reeks of smoke. In terms of the hotel's breakfast buffet, the food is not impressive. What's worse, the coffee shop is small  it allows smoking, so every morning while eating breakfast, we'd have to deal with smokers right on the next table. Most of the clients of this hotel are people from mainland China who smokes like chimney, so I'd suggest to get your breakfast elsewhere.
