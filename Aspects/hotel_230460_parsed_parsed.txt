<Content>Fantastic Stay Hotel Cecilia is excellently located - within sight of the Arc de Triomphe and within walking distance of Eiffel Tower. The room was clean, warm and of average size for a European hotel. The bath room was more than adequate. We had a room on the front and could hear the traffic noise but it was not bothersome. Breakfast provided a very good start to the day - and was always fresh and the staff were very attentative to the needs of the diners - never letting anything even get near to empty.We enjoyed walking down Mac Mahon Avenue in the opposite direction of the Arc and finding eating places as well as shopping all within a few minutes.

<Content>Location, Location, Location If location and ease is important to you, Hotel Cecilia is definitely right for you...buses from CDG Airport stop literally steps from the hotel, the Arc de Triomphe can be photographed from the room balconies and the Metro is at the end of the road. Our room was a good size and well equipped and the hotel interior is very Parisian. Breakfast was included in the room price and certainly set us up for the day - think unlimited supplies of croissants and pain au chocolats!Although there isn't an in-house restaurant for evening meals there are lots of high quality restaurants nearby which are fun discovering.Couldn't recommend this hotel anymore highly!!!

<Content>Great Location A friend recommended this hotel, I was really glad she did. The hotel is in an excellent location and feels really safe. 100m from the Arc De Triumph. The lift is really small and as there were 5 of us the kids usually ran up the stairs. We had two rooms the front room had a balcony over looking the Arc. The other room looked onto a court yard. Spotless bathrooms. Really warm and cosy in winter. We all had breakfast each morning which was ample at the hotel. Worked out at 拢50 each per night, really reasonable

<Content>Exceeded all expectations! Amazing location! I have never felt inclined to write, or had any desire to write, a review in my life but my experience of this hotel has compelled me to do so.I have never been to Paris before and thought I would take my girlfriend there for her birthday for the weekend. After scanning the internet for a while I came across this hotel and found a great deal. It looked like an amazing location and near the coach stop to our airport (Beauvais). I wanted everything to be perfect for the weekend so put alot of time and thought into finding the right place to stay.Upon arrival we were mazed by the location, right next to the Arc which meant, apart from anything else, it was very quick and easy to find in a huge city that was new to us. The hotel was welcoming, very smart and had a very unique (beautique as my girlfriend described it) vibe to it which made it all the more romantic. Our room overlooked the Arc, was spacious, clean and the bathroom was also spacious and very clean. The staff could not have been more helpful and the breakfast (which was inclusive) was simple yet very filling. I cannot recommend this hotel enough, especially if you are looking for a romantic weekend as we were. I have no criticisms and the location and staff make this the perfect hotel for tourists.

<Content>Perfect choice for us!! I'm not one to write reviews, but I thought the Hotel Cecilia was worth recommending! It was an easy trip from the train station to the hotel by Metro, and never having been to Paris, coming out of the Metro at night to see the Arc and Champs Elys茅es all it up and our hotel right there was amazing. Between the great location, welcoming lobby, clean twin room and a large modern bath , it was much more than I expected for the price (106e/night), especially since this included breakfast. Our 4th floor room faced the back, rather than the Arc, but with huge pull in windows overlooking the little courtyard, balconies and colored glass windows it was perfect and peaceful! We really only used the hotel to clean up and relax between sightseeing during our weekend, so I can't comment on ammenities such as the bar, internet access etc., but it was great for our needs.

<Content>Great experience The Hotel Cecilia was recommended to us by a friend of one of our 4 group members. We had no idea even with her positive recommendation that we would be as pleased with the hotel as we were. The location was perfect. The rooms were great and the bathrooms very large and modern. The staff could not have been more helpful with their restaurant recommendations and general info about transportation and the things that first-time travelers to an area needed. The first 3 of our 4 to arrive did not speak French but it was not a problem. We checked out of the Cecilia on Sunday morning after 2 nights to travel to southern France but had made reservations for the night before we were to leave as we were flying out of Charles de Gaulle airport. They allowed us to leave luggage that we did not need in their storage area while we were gone. When we returned on Wednesday afternoon, they handed us our keys, asked about our trip and immediately told us where to find our rooms - no signatures required. We opted for the breakfast buffet which was really great: coffee, assortment of juices, croissants, yogurts, fruit, cheese, jellies and jams, toast... We could not have asked for more.

<Content>Laundry room? My husband and I have just returned from a three night stay in Hotel Cecilia , Paris for my 40th birthday. When greeted at reception, we were immediately advised that our room was exactly the same as other rooms except that it was on the ground floor - which we thought was very strange at the time - not so. Our room was accessed through the reception area and we felt like we were second class citizens staying in the laundry room/broom cupboard. The room was small and tired. The toilet had been pushed into a corner behind the door which was difficult to access. Couldnt even sit down properly. We were very disappointed in the standard of the room - we paid dear for this accommodation and it certainly was not worth it! We will be passing this information on to our travel agent. However, the location of the hotel was excellent. If we had been presented with a room which was not through the reception area I have no doubt the whole experience would have been more pleasant.

<Content>Had a great time at this hotel I spent my honeymoon at this hotel and we had a wonderful stay. The hotel was smaller than I had expected, but the service was great, our room was very nice and comfortable and the location was excellent - it was so easy to get around Paris by using the metro station nearby, and it was very convenient to be so close to the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysees. The reception area is nicely decorated and the buffet breakfast was tasty. The Cecilia has everything you need.

<Content>An ideal hotel for a short break on a budget..... This small hotel is a real gem and ideally placed for a short trip to Paris. Our room overlooked the Arc De Triomphe - everywhere was within walking distance. The hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful. Fabulous value for money - highly recommended!

<Content>pleasant stay at the Cecilia Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Cecilia, Paris. Party of four which included my two daughters 16 and 21 years old, we had 1 double and 1 twin room. The hotel is brilliantly situated for the Air France Bus Shutle from the airport, RER train and Metro. Rooms are simple but have all you need hor a short visit in Paris. Breakfast is basic but good, all staff are very friendly and helpfull.

<Content>Great location, clean  We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Our room was on the small side, but very clean,  we didn't plan to go to Paris  spend a lot of time in our room. Breakfast was good. The reception staff were excellent, very helpful  pleasant. We tried to speak some french, but most staff had a good command of english. As for location, this hotel is brilliant. We took the Air France bus from Charles de Galle airport straight to the hotel. The nearest Metro is just a few minutes walk away  you can access most of Paris from here without too much difficulty. We would definately stay at this hotel again if we get the chance to re-visit Paris.

<Content>Very nice hotel and great location Had a great weekend break in paris staying at Hotel Cecilia, location was fantastic and is right next to Arc de Triomphe, the CDG airport bus drops you on the next street to hotel which is very convenient. Could not fault any aspect of hotel and the room we stayed was very clean and modern with everythng looking new, staff were friendly too, and the breakfast was also good. I highly recommend this hotel if you require a good central location and a modern, clean hotel room at a fair price.

<Content>Great place to stay Having read the reviews, I think Dave was very unlucky (strangely we did get room 44 - maybe the staff have been reading the website). I too have stayed in hotels, hostels  campsites of all star ratings. Hotel Cecilia is lovely - very clean, great location, breakfast was fine (esp the pain au chocolat!). We got great restaurant recomendations from the staff. I can happily recommend it.

<Content>Loved the Cecilia We stayed at the Cecilia from 12 to 16 May 2008. The staff at the hotel were really helpful and friendly. Breakfast is ample and is gives you are pretty good start to the day. The rooms are immaculately clean. Our room overlooked the front of the hotel and the view of the Arc de Triomphe from the room is breathtaking especially at night. My husband and I have visited Paris for the past few years during April and May and have previously stayed in the Opera district but the Cecilia is in a much nicer area and is within very easy reach of all the attractions. There are some really nice bars and restaurants within walking distance. The only downside to our holiday though was the prices. Even though the british pound is pretty weak at the moment against the Euro, Parisian prices seem to have been hiked up since last year. We paid 13鈧?0 for 2 glasses of cola (not pepsi or coca cola just the rubbishy stuff from a pump) at a cafe at Place de Clichy which was not a very nice place, so be careful. I doubt we will visit Paris next year if the prices remain so high but whenever we do decide to go back will definitely stay at the Cecilia.

<Content>Fantastic friendly hotel!!! This is a 1st class hotel, the staff are really nice  helpful. It's not so big - which means the staff get to remember you, ask you if you have had a nice time etc. The rooms have been recently re-decorated. The room was very clean, nice bathroom etc. It's location is suberb, we could see the Arc De Triomphe from our room - it's only about 2 minutes on foot.The breakfast room is a little small - only 9 tables, so on a weekend it was a little bit busy, but's that's only a minor gripe. Overall I would reccomend this to anybody. Our price for 2 people BB for 4 nights was 拢430.00 - which we thought was very good.Whilst going around on bus trips we thought the Montparnasse region had a better choice of cafe's  places to eat - but it's too far to walk from the hotel.Overall a very pleasant stay

<Content>Perfect Location Just back today after spending 4 days, 3 nights on our first trip to Paris. Stayed in Avenue MacMahon in a really nice 3* hotel - Cecilia. Our room was on the fifth floor with a tiny balcony that had a great side view of the L'Arc de Triomph. The room was a decent size with nice bathroom, spotlessly clean and LCD tv (which we never watched!). Continental breakfast was adequate, with the usual choice of juice, ham, cheese, rolls, cerial, toast etc. Fresh fruit would have been nice instead of tinned fruit cocktail but there was enough to keep you going until lunch time. Staff were friendly and helpful and recommended a couple of really good restaurants - Le Hide being one of them. We thought it a perfect location. We took the Air France bus from the airport which stopped in the next street, about 4 minutes walk from the hotel. Couldn't have been easier. Within walking distance of the Eifel Tower and Champs Eleysees. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would not stay anywhere else if we return to Paris.

<Content>Hotel Cecilia: the perfect place to stay in Paris! This 3 star hotel is the perfect place to stay in Paris, wether you are on holidays or for business, (wireless available, and printer)the team is really friendly and always here to make you enjoy your stay. The atmosphere is cosy, and i appreciated the wooden style decoration. There is also a piano if you appreciate music. My room had a nice bathroom, a LCD TV screen, and offered a wonderful view on the Arc de Triomphe! In the area of the hotel, there are plenty of things to do: restaurant, cinema, Champs Elysees, Lido...I recommand you this hotel very much for the kindness of the team, and the perfect location...What can I add?If you come, say hello from me to Viviane and Nadege!

<Content>Lovely little Hotel The Hotel Cecilia Arc De Triomphe says it all. It is about 500 metres from the Arc. The directions given by some tour companies may be a bit confusing. Metro to Charles De Gaul Etoille then take the exit for Avenue Wagram and turn left. What's not said is that you have to turn left again, immediately, the next street is the Avenue Macmahon, turn right and the hotel is down on the left.Once at the hotel the interior is quite something. The staff can't be more pleasant and helpful.When we stayed the hotel was being renovated so some noise was present but not intrusive and never early in the morning or late in the afternoon.Some of the facilities were not available and some as stated on some respected sites (Not this one) clealy were never available. Trouser press and in room safety deposit box, and I did not find any sign of a mini bar. Reception has a system for valuables in the hotel safe.The breakfast room is ornate, the breakfast itself isn't that comprehensive. Toast, yogourt, rolls, cheese etc, enough, but we would have liked a bit more, fruit perhaps.Outside the hotel there is a very good little supermarket which sells almost everything and should the unfortunate need arise a pharmacy is close by.Eating and drinking out is a bit of a challenge, not for the availability but the cost. Nearer to the Arc the prices do rise. A drink in sight if the Arc is about 4-5 euro, further away its about 2.5-4 euros. Turn left out of the hotel then at the crossroads turn right the Bistros are reasonable 16-23 euros for a set meal and very good.A nice, comfortable, friendly hotel, We would (Will) be going back.

<Content>Great hotel! Just returned from 6 nights at the Hotel Cecilia and enjoyed the stay very much. The hotel is a real gem - quiet with a friendly staff. The breakfast is great.The location of the hotel could not be better. It is very close to the metro which gives you access to the entire city. Public transport in Paris is great.Took the RER to Versaille one day which was very enjoyable. Bought our tickets in advance to avoid the lineup at Versaille but ended up in the line for people with tickets! The wait was long. Visitor reception at Versaille leaves a lot to be desired.Would definitely return to the Hotel Cecilia!

<Content>Perfect for your stay in Paris Myself and my partner stayed at Hotel Cecilia for 4 nights in September 2006. We enjoyed an excellent stay here! The Metro stations are v.close by, with lots of restaurants, shops a couple of minutes walk away! The red tour buses are just beside the Arc de Triomphe which you can see from the hotel. Breakfast is good, with a choice of cereals, fruit, breads and meats. The staff are v.helpfull and friendly and the chap that serves you tea is v.efficient! I would highly recommend this hotel for your stay, i will most certainly be recommending it to everyone!

<Content>Fantastic Just returned from a 3 night stay at this Hotel, brilliant location enjoyed every minute of it. Hotel well situated near to a main Metro station. Our room was on top floor and had a view over the Arcde Triomphe...fantastic. Room quite small however very clean and our room was cleaned every day we were there. Breakfast simple but enough and although dining room quite small never had to wait long for a table. Would definately recommend it.

<Content>Great Hotel We have just returned from a 4 night stay in this lovely little hotel. The staff were pleasant and helpful, our room faced the front, was light and airy with a super bathroom. Breakfast with English newspapers - what a good way to start the day! Just round the corner from the Arc, couldnt be better, but be careful when you exit the nearby Metro as all the roads look alike!. Watch the traffic on the Arc - its great fun - crazy but amazing! Have found a new respect for French drivers. L'Essentiale Restaurant nearby a great find. Also restaurant opposite L'Essentiale serves wonderful fish and chips (English style) and you will also be entertained by a magician during your meal. Used our museum and metro passes to visit Versailles which was helpful. A great few days.

<Content>Everything you could ask for from a 3 star. Everything you could ask for from a 3 star hotel, the staff were fantastically friendly and helpful especially the receptionist. The rooms were clean and tidy, outdated floral wallpaper but to be honest this just added to the character of the hotel. Lovely powerful shower...contintental breakfast incl choice of croissants, bread rolls, ham, cereal, selection of jams and juices. Fantastic location, arc de triomphe was a spectacular sight. Only down point was the size of the lift. All in all a lovely little hotel.

<Content>Great Location-Friendly Staff I recently spent two nights at Cecila for a b-trip and enjoyed the stay there. I would consider Cecilia to be a good hotel, but nothing special if you want a unique overnight experience in Paris. The staff was friendly and the location is great. Walking out of the hotel the Arc is only a two minute walk and impressive. The area nearby is great for eating and shopping.

<Content>Excellent choice You can't beat the location, especially when arriving by Air France bus which stops at the top of Avenue Carnot. Its close to the M1 Metro ligne at the Etoile. There are many places close by to eat lunch or dinner. The rooms include A/C, nicely bath and shower, great choice for breakfast (which is included). The staff is first rate. There are Taxi stands are located at the top of Avenue Wagram and Carnot. I have stayed at this hotel on multiple occasions and the quality is consistent.

<Content>Great Paris Hotel We stayed at this hotel to catch the end of the 2006 Tour de France, which finishes under the Arc de Triomphe. The hotel is a block from the Arc, a short walking distance from the Air France bus stop and has a very convenient public underground parking deck just in front of the hotel on the same side of the street. It was very easy for us driving in and out. The hotel room was nicer than expected and actually had A.C., which was great during the heatwave, and the staff were welcoming. Everything was organized and professional, and breakfast was sufficient and included. For the price, this is the best hotel we've stayed at in Paris. It's location is convenient to the RER and metro, and you can see the Arc from the front door.

<Content>Nice but thefts in hotel The hotel was nice and pleasant, with a good buffet breakfast as advertised. Unfortunately on our first morning we went out leaving some personal items in the room, but fortunately not our money or passports. On our return we found our Opera tickets had been taken along with some jewellery we had brought with us from the UK. We were most disappointed that the hotel staff were so unhelpful. They initially said this had never happened before and that they had confidence in their staff. However later it was mentioned that only recently a guest had had a laptop stolen. A further interview with the hotel owner, who was not there on the day of the theft, was equally unsympathetic and unhelpful, again the owner said it was not anything to do with her staff, and if we had receipts for the jewellery there was nothing to worry about. We complained to Cresta, who we had booked through, and they were so nice and understanding. Cresta also contacted the hotel on our behalf, but seemed to have little clout, as the attitude of the hotel never changed during the five days we stayed there.We had to go to the police station ourselves and report the theft as the hotel did not and would not do so saying there was no point. A little understanding from the hotel staff would have made all the difference. Unfortunately it is not a hotel I could now recommend or return to, which is a pity as its location is excellent.

<Content>Gem of a Hotel A lovely small hotel situated a minutes walk away from the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs Elysee and Charles de Gaulle station.A group of us stayed here and although some rooms were definately prettier and more spacious than others, all were well appointed and very clean.The staff were very helpful and friendly.We all agreed we would stay there when we returned to Paris.The only down point was the hotels web site stated an iron was in each bedroom. It isn't so take a travel iron.

<Content>Well situated We stayed at the Cecilia in May 2004 and the previous reviews are all pretty accurate, the rooms are compact and a little tired, but it's in a great location for the metro and the Champs Elysse. One word of warning; don't ask for a 'large beer' at the Beer Station just up the road - it's the only place in town which serves litres! Not exactly a rip-off but you could be faced with more than you expected.

<Content>Location, But Location, Location, Location! Less than 5 minute walk to the Arc De Triumph, main subway station and Champs. But, this hotel needs an update, the rooms are clean but the carpeting and furniture have seen better days. If you get a good deal on the room rate stay here, otherwise you might want to look elsewhere.
