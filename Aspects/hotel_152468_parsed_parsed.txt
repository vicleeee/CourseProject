<Content>Excellent location. Very good stay. The best thing about this hotel is its location, across the street from the Zona Rosa. You get exactly what you expect from a good Sheraton: nice clean rooms, very comfortable beds (no small feat in Mexico), and a luxury environment. Yes, it's a Starwood hotel, so they'll nickle and dime you for everything ($5 for a bottle of water, $15 for internet, etc).

<Content>Nice Hotel, Excellent Service This hotel is in Reforma in a safe and fairly quiet area. We received exceptional service from the hotel and in particular from the exceptionally helpful and friendly concierges. The hotel has 2 towers. The rooms in the older tower are adequate, the rooms in the newer tower are really nice. Definitely try to stay in the newer tower. The hotel was quite active with conferences and airline employees. The bar has live music, free snacks, and good drinks. The hotel also provides free internet service on several computers located in the lobby bar. Over all, this is an excellent place to stay - especially if you can get it on Priceline for cheap.

<Content>Need More Bilingual Personnel I stayed at this hotel during a Business trip. The hotel could you use a few renovations and the front/side of the building was currently under repair during my visit. I had the pleasure of staying on the 15th floor in what is considered the Business Suite. The sewer cover in my bathroom was not secured and could easily be kicked away. This is when I noticed the water sitting in the pipes. This is not a good thing for families with little kids. The closets are too small. I took a piece of soap and rubbed in the bottom of one of the glasses and put water in it to see if the maid would change the glass. The maid must of rinsed it quickly with water and tried to wipe it out. I later looked and could see where she didn't get all the soap out of the glass. There was no ice bucket in the room. The one plus for this hotel was the Business Suite had Butler Service 24/7. I had to call and request the Butler bring a bucket of ice to my room. I also had access to the Lounge on the 18th Floor whice provides Free Breakfast and a Evening Social Reception every night with a complimentary glass of wine or beer. This was pretty good since it's buffet style with a limited selection of refreshments and they cater to your need for drinks. I visited the Manhattan Deli twice during my 5 day stay and had the buffet meal which is not much to brag about. First you have to swat the nets and flies away from the food/deserts. By the time you get the courage to pursue a sweet treat your appetite is gone after seeing all the bugs flying around. The hotel seriour needs more bilingual staff. The Maid  Security staff I spoke to could not speak English. The staff was very helpful in any way possible with the exception of the language barrier. I speak English with a limited Spanish vocale. Even at the Mexican Airport it was hard finding employees who spoke English. This doesn't say much for a country when it comes to Tourist visiting your area. The stores in the hotel close early. For anyone from the States going for a first time visit, you definitely have to get used to the altitude change. It literally feels like your breath is being absorded from your body as you walk down the streets in Mexico City or go up and down on the elevator at times.

<Content>Disappointing Thankfully I only had a shirt stay in the hotel. The hotel is in dire need of a refurbishment. It has a tired look compared to other similarly priced and 'starred' hotels in the DF. The rooms look worn and the towels feel the same. Long queues for breakfast in the New York Deli, which also caters for non-guests, are not the best way to start the day. I resorted to the branch of Sanborns next door.

<Content>Rooms need refurbishing - 4 night stay on a business trip to Mexico City- Room was run down with chipped furniture, dated decor... I know the hotel has 2 wings so maybe I was unlucky- Amici restaurant overpriced breakfast, $19 for a buffet with only 4 hot dishes and a poor selection of fruit- The coffee in your room has to be paid for, when in other hotels I have stayed is always complimentary!!??- Very good location and all the staff I spoke to were always very friendly and polite...the saving grace!

<Content>Great Location, Love the D.F.! This property has a great location. There are tons of restaurants, bars and shops of all kinds within a 10 minute walk. The rooms are typical Sheraton fare. I had a corner combined suite which had a great view of the Angel of Independence monument. The staff were all great, taking care of any issues in a timely manor and quick with advice when asked. The one thing I did notice is the lobby is quite dated. It could definitely use a refurbishment.

<Content>An excellent choice in Mexico City The Sheraton Maria Isabel provided a flawless experience. It is conveniently located in Mexico City. Prices are very reasonable for a major chain hotel in Mexico City, and the restaurant is an exceptional value, offering extremely fine quality Mediterranean cuisine at reasonable prices.

<Content>The worst lodging ever. I stayed in this hotel for 31-days, and this was the worst I had in my 20-years plus of world traveling, considering is a Sheraton. The service is well below 3rd class quality, the personnel were a little inept, and the security and safety were below the standards. This review is based on the fact that this is a Sheraton, an US hospitality enterprise, and the return in satisfaction compared to price/ rate. The rooms are small, not that comfortable, with not enough closet space and not well lit. The sound proofing and sealing was very bad. Noise travels easily from room-to-room, room-to-hallways, and the doors-to-frame do not seal well. The negative results were expected. Room service was friendly but above all not very customer service oriented. The hotel restaurant, Manhattan Deli, had the worst customer service I ever experienced. They did not like to take phone orders, hung on calls, had the orders wrong, were never timely, etc, etc. In terms of security, I had the terrible of experience of people attempting to gain access to my room in 5-times while I was in it. In 1-ocassion the security guards did not even bothered to investigate, in another incident took them 20-25 to respond to my room. Bear in mind, the security guards (5+) are always hovering on the lobby. Twice, room service walked on me without knocking the door or ringing the bell while checking for room availability. The evacuation charts are very confusing since they display several dots showing where you are standing. It seems that a template was prepared and used for different locations. I contacted the management in several occasions to point out my terrible experience, and they did not show much concern. Two individuals from my party abandoned the hotel before the end of our stay in disappointment. Make no mistake, I am Hispanic and fully-bilingual, and this is very professional, objective observation. Overall, I will not recommend the place to a family or friend. You will not get your money鈥檚 worth for a Sheraton.

<Content>Nice Stay - Would Select This Hotel Again I was working at the U.S. Embassy for the week and this hotel was right next door.Since I booked at last minute, I had to get a Smoking Room; however, I could not smell any hint of smoke, so that was good. In the hallway I could, but the smell did not permiate into the room.I had free access to the Executive Lounge on the18th floor and it was nice. For those wanting Starbucks, there is one on the first floor of hotel.I enjoyed my stay and will be going back in August for another week.

<Content>Decent Stay at the Sheraton My sister and I stayed at Sheraton Maria Isabel for the first time. This was a nice upgrade from the Calinda Hotel in the Zona Rosa, but that's another review. The rooms were clean and quiet, and I smelled no smoke whatsover in our smoke-free room. My only complaint was the bedspread was unusally thick and heavy. It was a balmy 65-70 degrees so the thick covers were unnecessary. It would have been okay to kick those off, but then the blanket was very coarse and itchy. Other than that, we had a great stay. The staff was very helpful and solicitous, and we will return.

<Content>Nice Hotel. We stayed at the Sheraton Maria Isabel in the Plaza De Reforma over Thanksgiving. The location is about 3 miles from the downtown sites. I would have preferred to stay at the downtown Sheraton, simply for the location. However this hotel was very nice and comfortable rooms.

<Content>Unhappy with the service Well it was during the World Dog Show that I stayed. There were hundreds of howling urinating dogs in the place. When I complained, the manager told me it was my tough luck.The food they served was cold. The bar is dated. The barman had never heard of a cappaccino. We switched to the other Sheraton in town after much negotiations. The other one is a much nicer building and the restaurants are nicer but the staff are equally inept.I have stayed in maybe 20 different Sheratons - these ones are very poor and it is mostly down to the staff.

<Content>Nice!!! I got a great deal from Hotwire (100 USD). This hotel is very nice really, fully renovated, centrally located, friendly staff, nice rooms with modern furniture (bathroom a little dated though), cable TV, etc. People in other reviews complain about pricey food and services. They complain for things like a 270 (25 USD) steak in the hotel restaurant. GOD!!! Those are international prices. Every Sheraton in the world is going to charge you 25 USD for a steak (or maybe more). This people think that because they are in Mexico they should pay 2 USD for a steak. If they want cheap food, just walk a little bit. The hotel is walking distance to a lot of restaurants and clubs in the Zona Rosa.

<Content>Charges for everything! Generally speaking, the Maria Isabel is a perfectly acceptable choice, and manages to maintain a standard which one would expect from a Sheraton property, with one or two exceptions. The location is very handy for those staying in Mexico City on business, or wishing to experience the dlights of Zona Rosa, which is just across the road. It's also a good base for tourists wishing to explore more of the City and surrounding areas.I wasn't lucky enough to get a room/suite/mini-city in the 'Towers' of the hotel, so my 'regular' room in the main building overlooked the eternal queues which snake to the visa and consular section of the US embassy next door. The room was a little tired; not exactly in desperate need of renovation, but a bit of a refresh. Standard Sheraton fayre, really! Furnished with two queen beds, had four people occupied the room it would have definitely been a tight squeeze. There was an adequate wardrobe which houses an ironing board and iron plus the safe, which fitted my laptop perfectly. The bathroom was fine, with the toilet tucked away and the bath/shower partially concealed. Sufficient space for all your toiletries and plenty of towels provided, plus hairdryer.My big bugbear with this place is that they charge for ameneties/facilities which properties of this standard should not be doing. There is a coffee maker provided close to the minibar/mini-fridge, but the two coffee bags provided are charged for as part of the minibar list! Not acceptable. I'm not a gym-buny unfortunately, but access to the gym is also chargeable unless you are paying certain rates, (I'd enquire and get something confirmed - in writing - if this is appliccable to you). The rates quoted to colleagues varied a lot, too, so find this a little hard to trust. I also don't think its unreasonable to provide at least one bottle of water free of charge; tap water is apparently drinkable but not recommended. Three bottles are provided, but yep, you guessed it, at a fee.Staff are friendly enough but it all feels a little perfunctory, as if they are just going through the motions.Lower your expectations a little and you won't be disappointed. If you know this kind of place from experience, you'll get exactly what you expect.

<Content>Not what we expected My wife and I have just returned from a week in Mexico city where we stayed at the Maria Isabel. The location of the hotel is great and the lobby is very elegant. However we found our room to be very ordinary and the desk does have a metal bar to remind you that your shins hurt from the last time you banged them. The pool is on the ninteenth floor, which is impressive, but to get there you have to go through the business section of the hotel and all of the very busy conference rooms. the gym and sauna are located in the lobby, again making you pass through the entire lobby! neither my wife or I felt comfortable to use either of these facilities. We found the Manhatttan cafe to be one of the most expensive restaurants in Mexico city serving a t-bone steak at 270 pesos- about double the price of other places. A gin and tonic cost 115 pesos ( that s about ten us dollars!!!!!) - a bottle of gin can be bought at a local store for almost the same price. The staff were generally nice and helpful but beware of extended hands at every opportunity. The starbucks is a great asset in the hotel and there is a Sanburns directly to the right as you exit the hotel. We will not go back there.

<Content>Not What I Expected Unfortunately Despite the wonderful concierges and the very friendly people, unfortunately, I will never stay at this hotel ever again. Here鈥檚 why:1) Terrible sound-proofing. The walls are UNBELIEVBABLY THIN: This is worse than a college dormitory. For 2 nights I was awaken by some moron in the other room blasting his TV at 3 am and 7 am. 2) Cigarette smoke. There is the smell of cigarette smoke on my non-smoking floor. For some reason, foreigners here love to smoke and can鈥檛 stop. So I ended up with a very bad sore throat because they couldn鈥檛 stop the cigarette smokers on a NON-SMOKING FLOOR.3) Horrible desks. Some idiot, who made the desk table, put a METAL BAR right near your shin (I kid you not!). So I would constantly hit my shin on the metal bar! It was unbelievable. Why would you construct a desk with a metal bar across the legs? If you want black and blue marks, stay at this hotel.4) Bad beds for tall people. The sheets are NOT FITTED. This is an ongoing problem with a lot of hotels today. These idiots think most people are 5鈥? and under.5) Window wouldn't close. My window couldn't close all the way, so I had the monsterous machine noise sounding outside my window all night. I already changed rooms, so I couldn't bother them again.Again, the people at the Sheraton, with the exception of one manager, are extremely polite and efficient. However, I warn you that you may not have an enjoyable stay.Imagine trying to enjoy beautifu Mexico City on 4 hours of sleep - it's not fun. When you're in a foreign city, you want to be able to REST, RELAX, and SLEEP.This hotel is really worth: $50 a night. I paid $80 which was too much.The reason it鈥檚 currently selling at $175 or more is because of the oil companies causing world-wide inflation and havoc.Something has to be done about gasoline cars or everything will be overpriced. We must pass laws for electric cars soon or the world ends.But I digress. Staying at this hotel is a risk if you are use to true 4-star hotels. It has a 4-star lobby, but the rest of my experience is anything but that.

<Content>Reassuringly as expected Nice for a change to stay somewhere that is predictable, reliable, and comfortable! This Sheraton in downtown Mexico City were ready fro me, had an excellent kingsize room ready and took care of my (admittedly basic and dull!) needs with the minimum of fuss. Room service was rapid, wake up calls were on time, taxis were available (even at 4 am on the morning I left!).Of course, it's downtown ... they do say it's not the best part of the city if an earthquake strikes, but if you're going to worry about that, stay away from Mexico City. Otherwise, stay at the Sheraton, drink the free bottled water, avoid Montezuma's revenge and have a dull but comfortable time!The hotel does have a lively bar (Mariachi Band!), a decent restaurant (if breakfast is a good guide) and Starbucks attached -- but I can only vouch for the good breakfast.

<Content>Home away from Home This hotel is amazing, a jewel in Mexito City.LOCATION: The most central location while still in a safe neighborhood, most rooms overlook El Angel, which is Mexico City's main monument, in the heart of the city. Easy access to anywhere you want to go in the city, which is amazing given that Mexico City is the largest city in the world!!!SAFETY: THe hotel is very safe and they have their own taxis waiting outside, that you can take resting assured that they are monitored and safe. Also, the front door and on the inside has great security. Felt very safe ,which is very needed these days in Mexico City. SERVICE: Amongst the best i have ever experienced. From the moment you step out of your cab at the curb, expect worldclass service. They know your name, they anticipate your every need. As part of the Starwood Preferred Program, we were upgraded to the Towers for 2 nights. We had butler service, welcome champagne and fresh fruit in our room, plasma TV, free pressing of our clothes and shoe shining, they woke us up with cofee and orange juice at the time we asked...it was absolutely amazing!!! The other night we stayed at the regular tower, and still had amazing service and a super nice room.ROOMS: Expect spotless rooms, as clean as can be. Marble floors and counter tops int he bathroom, shower, etc. Safety box, coffee machine, spacious and modern rooms. Do not stay at the old tower, the one without the view, because those rooms are old and not very well taken care of (they are chepaer, but not by much). ON SITE ATTRACTIONS AND SERVICES: excellent on site restaurants and next door to Sanborn's, a great local place for magainzes, pharmacy, and a wonderful restaurant that offers traditional mexican food. Back to the hotel, their bar is awesome, with live music and shows alomost every night. the lobby at this hotel is splendid, all marble and beautiful. Great on site shops, althgough very pricey. Did not get to see the pool. Free showe shining service for guests in lobby. Overall, i feel at home in this place...and for someone who grew up in Mexico City and has been away for nine years, i think it says a lot. GREAT hotel! i will always stay at this hotel when i go back to mexico city.

<Content>Great Place I recently stayed at this hotel June 10-14, 2007. The location of the hotel on the Reforma is great and is right across fromt he US Embassy. The room was well lit, bed was extremely comfortable, room service was fast, the bathroom larger than expected and very nice. Check in was quick and easy. Eventhough my reservation was lost somewhere in limbo, the General Manager was quick to get me a room and at a reduced rate then originally booked and was very apologetic for the mixup. I was traveling by myself and always felt very safe. Throughout the hotel, everywhere you go, you can see security guards. I used the Business Center and found their rates to be cheap, $7 for the first 30 minutes, which was all I needed and cheaper than calling back to the US. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Safe, Large Hotel - Starbucks a nice treat The Hotel was located right next to the Angel on La Reforma. It is across the street from the Zona Rosa and right next door to the USA Embasy. (So security is pretty high and safe in the area with the SWAT team personel posted up next door).Yes the gym cost 10$ I believe to use along with the other services. At night, they had a small lounge area where mariachi played at the bar. It did cost to 10$ I believe to enter however to watch the show they put on.Starbucks is connected to the Hotel...was nice to go to in the morning before my meetings. Very clean and much like in the US. There were lots of buisness people there from the US it seemed to me and lots of people in and out... It is about 10 large blocks to the Zocalo but a taxi for 3$ can take you out to there in 5-10 mintue drive.There was a pool upstairs on the roof which I do believe was free for guests.Also, beware with the Irons...they are very HOT and little did i know can burn through a good pair of dockers....High on an iron at the sharaton in DF means VERY HIGH... :(

<Content>Time for an update and to stop nickel and diming you to death I booked the hotel because it is the only Western hotel chain next to the Zona Rosa. The Zona Rosa is the gay section of Mexico City and has bars, rest., clubs, etc. The hotel is typical of a 3 star Shearton. If you book a room with a king bed expect a very small room. I moved into a double bed room which was huge compared to the king bed room. The carpet and furniture are dated and worn. As a Platinum member I was upgraded to a Platinum floor which means I麓m able to eat in the club on the 18th floor which saves money for breakfast and dinner. (You cannot wear shorts in the club room they will send you back to change) The club is very nice and so is the staff. There are a few drawbacks to the hotel. FIrst there is no sound proofing between the walls or the outside. Therefor if you are visiting over a weekend you will hear disco music if your room faces the Zona Rosa so avoid these rooms. Unfortunately these rooms have the best veiw of the Angel. You will also hear the other adjoining guests in their room and especially out in the hall. I麓ve been awoken daily by doors slamming from other guests. The Air Conditioner does not cool very well, especially late night so you will awake feeling wet/clamy. If you are a person who likes it cold avoid this hotel. I also do not appreciate the cost for the gym, coffee, etc. Unless you are a platinum starwood member I would sooner spend the money at the Marco Polo hotel. It has a better location and appears nicer. Have fun.

<Content>Disappointed I have just returned from my first business trip to Mexico City and I had a really great visit but was really disappointed in the hotel. I booked my reservation through my company's travel agent thus receiving the corporate rate for an executive suite room. When I checked in I was told that my corporate rate only guaranteed me a standard room, when I asked why, I was told that this was what my corporate rate allowed. I didn't argue too much because a) I had arrived late and b) I was really tired after having worked all day since 6 am and had just flown in from Monterrey from an event, all I wanted was a hot shower and a warm bed.I got to my room and to be honest, the Holiday Inn in Montreal, where I stayed at during my last vacation was better than the shabby room I got.When the bell hop showed me around the room, he turned on the lights from a faux drawer in the night table--it promptly fell down when he moved away. I looked up the hotel and the amenities that a standard room is supposed to have and I have yet to find the bathrobe, or VCR in the room. I got a blowdryer but only after I asked for it at the front desk and whad to blowdry my hair next to the coffee maker as ALL THREE outlets in the bathroom did not work. The one thing not listed in the amenites section was a weight from Weight Watchers which was broken.And to make things even more interesting, the floor I was staying on was in the process of renovating at least 3 or 4 rooms, so in the mornings I was greeted with the pleasant smell of paint and/or other smells. Also, the walls were so thin, I could hear what my neighbor in the next room was watching and I believe this was in part due to the fact that the control remotes are programmed not to go below a certain sound level. The front desk staff was helpful depending on who I spoke with. When I wanted to change my room I called ahead from my room and was told I could change to a higher floor at no extra charge but when I went to the actual front desk I was told that I would have to pay $150 IN ADDITION to my corporate rate which did not make sense at all since I wasn't going to be in the tower that looked out onto the avenue and where the rooms were more expensive. I later found out that they had a number of conferences and groups showing up the day after I checked in thus the shortage of rooms.I agree with the person who posted that they felt nickel and dimed during their stay: $14 per day for internet use?! $10 to use the gym?! $5 for using the coffee pot in the room?! why not just add these fees to the room rate?On an up note, a Starbucks in-house and really, really nice, professional, trustworthy and efficient taxi drivers were at my disposal and let me in on a few of the things the city had to offer. Also, after this visit, I will qualify to move to Elite status in the Starwood Preferred Guest program--the group that Sheraton Hotels is part of, so perhaps on my next visit to Mexico City I will receive the executive suite I was originally supposed to get....

<Content>Nice Location. Good Service. The hotel is located in the very nice Paseo de la Reforma, close to the downtown area El Zocalo and also close to the Museums and Shopping Centers in the Residential Area. The hotel is next to the American Embassy and across the street is the Zona Rosa. The Service is very good. Rooms are large and the decor is pleasant. We had a large window with a nice view of the city. The bathrooms are large and well designed. Our only complaint is the extra charges made for additional expenses. A three minutes call to the US was US$35 and a bottle of water in the room was US$12. The laundry charges were also exaggerated with a shirt costing US$12.

<Content>A good option outside the main tourist area This hotel is well appointed with good size rooms and are in good general condition, clean and well maintained. The rooms in the fron ttower are better in my opinion, seemed more modern and spacious (we stayed in both). We didn't make much use of the facilities, you don't need to as there are plenty of good restarants nearby in the Zona Rosa. We found it perfectly safe to walk around, including walking homee after eating out in the evening. The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful. Although not in the Historic Zone this is well away from the dense traffic and crowds in that area - and the better for it. You are roughly midway bewteen the Centro Historico and the Park and can walk to either (its about 40 minute walk to the Zocalo. It's also only about 20 minutes (depending on traffic) from the airport - so is good for shorter stays.

<Content>Stay at the Sheraton Maria Isabel, Mexico City I travel to Mexico twice a year and, once in a while, I have stayed at a different property but almost always I return to the Sheraton Maria Isabel on the Reforma. The staff at the Sheraton is incredible. They are extremely attentive to details and even remember you, your name, your favorite drinks, the last time you were there, and are always ready and eager to offer suggestions to make the stay more pleasant and enjoyable. This past May I was there again and after a long day of business meetings, I returned home to the Sheraton to find a birthday cake in my room with a nice birthday card from the Manager of Guest Relations. I honestly do not even know how they knew it was my birthday. But it did prove my point that no one welcomes you home like the Maria Isabel, my favorite hotel!

<Content>I hate being nickel and dimed Lat week I stayed in this hotel to attend a meeting in Mexico City. Adjacent to the U.S. Embassy, and across the street from the Zona Roas, the loaction is pretty good. However, the attitude one is immersed in, one of let me take advantage of the international traveller, is just plain annoying. While the in-room safe is free, thats about it - no free breakfast, or water. I considered myself lucky the room rate inclluded the hotel gym, I spoke with another guest and she had to pay for it. The in-room coffee pot - $4.50...Of course, one expects to pay more the mini-bar - but $5.50 for a national beer? Please. Now the only good thing is that there are a number of 7-11 stores close by - so I walked up a block and paid $5.00 for a 6 pack of beer. I ended up eating all my meals in the Zona Rosa as the hotel prices were just too high. I the htoel complex there is a Starbucks - I don't normally frequent them here in the U.S. but you could get a large cup of the dailly joe at $2.20. The hotel does offer a small rooftop pool, although I did not get a chance to use it as my free time was so limited and the one time I could have used it - the hotel announced it was closed due to work being done on the conference floor it is on.TV has very limited international channels and had no free movie channels a la HBO or Cinemax.Internet access in the business center was $7.00 for 30 minutes - but you could walk a few blocks away and find Internet Cafes for $1.00 for an hour.That said, the bed was comfortable, bathroom and closets were spacious. However, just could not overcome the feeling they were trying to get every possible nickle out of me so I think I will stay at other hotels in the nearby Zona Rosa next time I go to Mexico City on business.

<Content>Excellent hotel, great service, pet friendly I ended up in this hotel for a one-night stopover in Mexico City on a rather unusual journey... although we would normally have stayed in an airport hotel, I was travelling with my parents and their two dogs and this was the only hotel we could find in the whole of Mexico City which welcomes pets!The price was a little beyond my normal budget, and although I qualified for a negotiated rate I could not get it because the hotel was completely full (and that says something, since it is a huge hotel, around 750 rooms I think) But the service was first class and justified the money spent.Sheraton offer special Sweet Sleeper Dog Beds but none were available that day, so at check-in I was upgraded by the very courteous and friendly receptionist to a suite on the 14th floor (Towers section, like executive floors) with a beautiful view of Reforma and the Angel of Independence.I was there a few days after the Cubans were expelled. Whilst I strongly disapprove of the USA trying to apply its laws extra-territorially, I can't really blame the Sheraton management and staff for taking the decision to expel Cuban trade representatives on the orders of the US Treasury Dept. The management are just trying to run a good hotel and look after their guests, and happened to get caught up in a political row. It's not the hotel management's business to fight the US government, and the Cubans were no doubt well aware they were inviting controversy by choosing an American-owned hotel right next door to the US embassy for their business trip.Fortunately, there's a lovely piece of well kept lawn just in front of the US embassy and both dogs were able to do their business there after their 14 hour flight from Europe, in full view of the US guards and Mexican police.We ate dinner in one of the hotel's restaurants. Dinner was average and I would say overpriced. I would say there are much better dining options in Mexico City, but we were only there one night so of course it was convenient. Breakfast, on the other hand, was excellent, a real buffet feast of every type of breakfast you could imagine.The location is very central, but Mexico City is so big and spread out that you really need to choose a hotel near whatever you want to visit. If you are going there as a tourist, the location is great, near the Zona Rosa and historic centre.This is something of a classic hotel. At the time it was built, it was the largest hotel in Latin America. It has quite a history, being named after (if I've got my history right) Maria Isabel, wife of Sir James Goldsmith, and the daughter of Antenor Pati帽o, who built the hotel. Pati帽o was famous for, amongst many other things, the Las Hadas Hotel on the beach in Manzanillo. But there are no doubt more modern hotels which would be much more convenient for the newer business districts like Santa Fe.Still, this was one of the best city hotels I have stayed in in a long time, if not the best. I will certainly return.

<Content>Overall a nice experience I thought the rooms were large, well-decorated, with ample closet space. I found the mini-bar to be convenient but intimidating due to the prices. I enjoyed the use of the spa, which was clean, modern, and well-maintained. Staff was courteous, and I left one day before the diplomatic incident. I got a good rate at the hotel, but if they lowered their prices, it would probably invite more guests to spend money and dine at the hotel. I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Guest misunderstood 'racist manager' At Sheraton Maria Isabel The guest complaining about the racist manager and staff at the Maria Isabel in early February happened to witness an international controversy prompted by the United States demanding that the hotel management order a delegation of Cubans to leave the hotel. I'm sure they were all under a lot of pressure to carry out the request from the U.S. government since Starwood Resorts, which operates Sheraton and Westin and other hotels, is headquartered in the United States. I'm sure it was an ugly confrontation, but guests must realize this was an unusual event that was still making headlines almost a month after it happened, with Mexico ordering the hotel closed, and hotel officials refusing the do so, etc.Anyway, my many stays, dinners, lunches, etc. at this hotel have always been first class. It was a favorite drinking and eating place when I lived in Mexico City. DAVID ANTHONY RICHELIEU San Antonio Texas

<Content>Loved Sheraton Maria Isabell Hotel!!! The hotel offers the best service I've ever experienced. The waiters remember your name and what you ordered for breakfast. The bed was sooo comfortable, we almost did not want to wake up in the morning. Also beautiful area and views of the Angel of the Independence!! The Concierge is very knowledgeable and gave us tips for sightseeing. Everyone was just great. Strongly recommend it -- We will certainly go back!!

<Content>Very racist manager When I stayed in the hotel in the lovely city of Mexico, at February 3, I had to see the manager of the hotel and his security personal, how they acted in a racist manner against other tourists in the hotel, getting them out of the hotel, even without giving them back the money they have paid before for their journey.The only reason they gave, why the tourists had to leave the hotel, was their national origin.I was afraid that they could do the same thing to me and leaved the hotel the same day. When I asked for the manager for to give him my reasons for to change the hotel, the personnel denied me to see him.I have travelled a lot in my live, but I never saw such a racist hotel manager as the one of the Sheraton Maria Isabel in Mexico City.

<Content>Home Sweet Sheraton Maria Isabel I have been staying at this hotel since 1999 and find it one of the most accomodating hotels in Latin America. The staff is almost like family and the rooms always comfortable. Staying in the Tower portion of the hotel that faces the Reforma and El Angel is the best way to orient yourself to the Zona Rosa and the attractions there. The authorized taxis at the hotel are the best way to travel about the City. Courtesy and attention is the hallmark of the hotel staff

<Content>A Sheraton you get what you pay for a 60's four star business hotel. Good modern gym, small rooftop pool and sundeck. Near to bars/restaurants/centre/chapultipec park/museums etc. Lacking in character, but a reliable bet if you can't be bothered taking the risk on somewhere with character!!

<Content>Pleasant and comfortable I was on business in Mexico City and stayed three nights at the Maria Isabel. The service is very good, the restaurant is adequate and the rooms are comfortable enough. The bed is very comfortable, one of Sheraton's new marketing angles. I would have liked more water pressure, but it got the job done. I would recommend this hotel to a business traveler or to vacationers. The location is excellent. The staff was most curteous and helpful. Call a Sitio taxi in lieu of using a hotel taxi if you'd like to save about 30% on fares.

<Content>very average Location is good - but there are plenty of decent hotels in the Zona Rosa that don't require crossing the Reforma to get to.Rooms are on the small side, especially in the older building. Concierge wasn't as helpful as could have been. Swimming pool is tiny; workout room costs 10$ a visit. Typical boring business hotel. Their taxi service is way overpriced compared to the sitio in the block behind the hotel.

<Content>Loved Sheraton Maria Isabella Rooms were a little small but the hotel staff was very helpful. They have all the ameneties needed. They have a travel agency in the hotel which we used . We booked a tour to the pyramids and a driver/guide,Eduardo, who was excellent! Spoke english took us to Coyacan, San angel, Xochimilco, University to see some Frida and Diego Rivera works. The hotel's Jorongo bar has great atmosphere whith live music you can sing along and request songs a veryintimate setting.The hotel is in between champultepec park and historic center great location. The area is very safe lots of armed police presence. The Hotel has an ATM inside, whcih is safe and comes in handy. The resturants are okay but we found better dining at the resturants Eduardo recommended. The Hotel is right accross the street from thr Turibus (double decker red bus you pay $15 and get on and off all day). The Hotel was a great palce stay I would definately stay there again!
