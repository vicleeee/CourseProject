<Content>Nice clean hotel and with sunny rooms Clean hotel and very close to central station if you want to use the trains or buses. I got the train from the airport to the hotel and it took less than 5 minutes to walk from the train station to the hotel.Check in was easy and friendly.Rooms were a good size and there was plenty of natural light coming in and they had good quality black out blinds for the morning sun.The bed was comfortable.Pro's:Check in was friendly and fastClose to the train stationLots of natural light in the roomGreat views from the upper floors when you get out the elevatorCon's:Although the room was clean, the bathroom had lots of mold in itNot close to all the action ie. Opera house, the rocks etc (30 minute walk away)Have to lift the luggage up about 12 stairs as there is no ramp and no bell boyI would stay here again - it was clean, tidy and quiet.

<Content>Terrible service, room smelt of smoke I would never go back to this hotel. After 3 weeks of excellent hotels and service on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland we were dropped back down to earth when checking in. First of all, we booked 2 rooms as there were 4 of us, when checking in they had us down for 1 room, 2 double beds (1 being a settee). We argued and argued with different people until they agreed to put us in two separate rooms (no apology or anything). Then one of the 2 no smoking rooms we were given smelt of smoke. Not just smoke but fresh smoke. The carpets in both rooms were also stained and needed a good clean and the shower in 1 room was not working properly. It seems that with this hotel if you a business prerson they accomodate you, if you are on holiday you are just an inconvenience. To top it off, we wanted a taxi and when we asked it was as if it was a hassle to ring. The location is not too good either, right in the middle of chinatown. $8 for 1 hour of internet access is extortionate and everything that is in your room you have to pay for.I would never go back to this hotel.

<Content>Charged additional money afterwards - without reason! Our stay itself wasn't terrible, but what happened afterwards was more than that!When paying the bill with my european credit card an AUD and a Euro ammount was shown. I asked twice, whether I will be charged in AUD, being aware the the exchange rate wasn't good. I was twice told that I will be charged in AUD.Checking my account later, I saw that they charged for the bad Euro rate - that cost me about 10 Euro (approx. 20 AUD).OK, I checked the receipt again and saw that I signed to accept this - my fault but however a really bad behaviour of the receptionist I think.But it came better - some days later I realized that they charged additional 3 Euro from my credit card. I tried to contact the hotel twice per mail, without any reaction. That's a really presuming behaviour! I know that it's not really a big amount of money, but it's the principle.Besides that trouble the standard of the hotel is not 4.5 stars. Huge stains on the carpet and a perhaps 2 star bathroom. Small and old.After this experience, I will avoid to book a room in any of the hotels of this group.

<Content>3 star room, 2 star service! I am normally willing to overlook small issues with customer service, however this place was no where near what a 4.5 star hotel should be like. I think because it is a very big conference centre, the individual customer does not matter. On five of the six occasions we had to deal with reception they were bordering between indifferent to very rude. We had booked a deluxe double room (king size bed) and were put in a twin room, this was not fixed. The room itself, looked like and old 3 star hotel with some new furniture. The carpet was badly stained all over, the desk was unclean, but the biggest issue was the bathroom. In all the 4 star hotels I have stayed at, none have come close to the one in the city gate central. It was OLD, small, and downright dingy. Hopefully the photos will do it justice, no wonder they don鈥檛 show photos of it on the website The only positives were the soft beds with nice linen and large TV and location wise it is very close to central station and china town.Overall there are better places to stay in Sydney for better customer service and rooms, at similar rates.

<Content>Reasonable hotel in Sydney Needed a reasonable priced 3-star hotel in central Sydney. Hotel wasn't right next to the Circular Quay but that wasn't our main priority and we just wanted to stay in a good hotel (not spectacular) in the middle of the city.Hotel provided everything we needed and there was a bus stop right nearby which we took to get to the city center and a train station which we could walk to in less than 5 minutes.

<Content>Loved the views from upper floors Stayed at the Citgate Central for 4 nights in October- perfectly situated and quiet. Close to Central Station for all tourist stops and within walking distance of Darling Harbour. Very modern, clean and spacious, big rooms , well equipped. We had a couple of restaurant meals too which were excellent.Staff friendly and efficient. Views from the upper floors were good too!Would definitely stay again and recommend to others

<Content>Relaxing stay in the end! Just returned from a 4 night stay stay at the Citigate. Arriving at around 2pm on our internal flight from Sunshine Coast. Check in and out was a breeze and the room was light and spacious and very clean with a super city view on the 16th floor. We had paid 拢70 per night to include an executive room with breakfast for ease, although we need not have had breakfast included as there is an array of restuarants on the doorstep. The location of the hotel is superb for cheap eats in Chinatown and Paddys markets for cheap souveniers and the buses run from the end of the road to Circular Quay etc every few minutes. Unfortunately after we returned to our room from walking around the city the peace was broken by screaming children in the room next door (the only ones in the whole hotel I think!), the walls of the hotel must be very thin as it sounded like they were in the room with us. Breakfast was great, wonderfully presented and friendly Asian staff always smiling and nothing too much trouble as always. After our experiences the previous evening we asked at reception when our neighbours were checking out and unfortunately it was the same day we were so I asked if they wouldn't mind moving us. They completely understood, as I think there had been some noise at breakfast also. We were moved directly above to the 18th floor, but it seemed we had jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire as the fridge did not work and there was a strange buzzing noise which we established was coming from the airconditioning units on a wall adjacent to our window. So I asked if we could move again, I think patience was wearing a bit thin with the woman on reception but I thought why should we have our trip marred by this, it is four star otherwise we'd have booked in to the Wake Up across the road and paid half the price. The manager came out to speak to me and said it was not a problem at all and he personally checked the new room they were giving us which was across the landing, fair enough we did not have the city view we had before but we had a wonderful sunset view instead. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel for location/service/staff and cleanliness and on reflection perhaps the family with noisy children should have been the ones that were moved away from disturbing the other guests in the first place.

<Content>Clean Convenient  I stay here a fair bit for work. I return here every 2 or 3 weeks as I believe it is good value for money, especially as the hotels in Sydney can be quite pricey. As previously stated it is right next to Chinatown so there are heaps of chinese restaurants along Dixon St. Also close to the Capitol Theatre  Central Station. Easy walk to Darling Harbour, Entertainment Centre  surrounds.Check in  out are always quick  efficient. Beds reasonably comfy. No real view to speak of. Internet in the rooms is expensive. Could do with a few more Foxtel channels. Carparking is an extra $20/day.

<Content>Not a problem. First, I would normally give this kind of hotel 3 stars. However, most hotels in Sydney seem over-priced these days and it was delightful to find a good place, in a good location at a good price.I stayed here when was the Carlton Crest and, besides the new (simplified) lobby, not a lot has changed. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable of the local area and the rooms are comfortable.I have read a lot of negative comments about this end of town, but I much prefer it to the northern end of the city. There are plenty of great restaurants (especially Chinese) and Paddy's market is only a 2-minute walk.As one of the other posters mentioned, stay there if you can get a good package/rate.

<Content>Good clean business hotel I stayed here late 2007 for a couple of nights in Sydney on business. I was weary about a) being dumped into a hotel in Chinatown near the Uni of Technology and b) staying at a hotel formerly known as the Carlton Crest ...When a hotel uses the 'formerly known' angle - things must be bad.They weren't.I was pleasantly suprised by the Citigate and would happily stay there again - as a business traveller. Nestled in the heart of Chinatown - Broadway and Ultimo are a stonesthrow - and it is a short walk into town. There is no 'budget' or 'uni student' feel to the establishment. The best thing about the Citigate is that you walk out the door and have wonderful restaurants (i.e. Chinatown) at your doorstep.The foyer seems quite grand - though figuring out how to get to the lifts or carpark entrance is quite a struggle. The lifts are probably the worst part of the hotel and I am sure there are two child labourers under the shatfs raising and lowering the lifts with a systems of ropes and pullies. Apart from that it was great. Business services were adequate (car park a bit far from Hotel - but included in price), the rooms had gorgeous views of Sydney and I mentioned the proximity to great Asian restaurants. For international travellers - Central Station is just down the road. I would visit again - though (as I have said) probably only on business.

<Content>great location We booked this hotel as it suited our needs as we required a place to stay near to Central Railway Station. On arrival the staff were friendly and prompt in serving us. There were steps up to the main foyer which wouldn't have been suitable for people with mobility problems and the car needed to be parked in the parking station nearby. The room was generous in size with plenty of light, desk space and a new bathroom. We had 2 comfortable, clean queen size beds, in a quiet room.2 problems, the first was the room key did not work and secondly the lifts were slow, it took 20 minutes to go from floor 9 to the lobby for checkout, so we were glad we weren't in a hurry. There were long waits for checkout, so perhaps extra need to be put on in peak times. Overall we enjoyed our stay and felt it was good value for the money.

<Content>Very nice- affordable weekend away! We stayed for the long weekend - special occassion. I booked on wotif.com and requested a non smoking room with a nice view. We got a room on the 12th floor. The staff were friendly and the room was nice and clean. The furniture was nice- recently refubished. The hotel is located on a quiet street in china town. There are plenty of cheap places to eat near by and Darling Habour and city central are walking distance (don't where heels =o). I reccommend the Dela France on George st for brekkie or naughty snack. Yummy quiches, french pastries and beautiful coffee - open 24/7. mini bar is overpriced but there is a conveniance store accross the road. Over all I really enjoyed my stay at the citigate central. I liked that it wasnt in the heart of the city - it was a bit more relaxed and there wasn't swarms of people everywhere.

<Content>Prime Location, Excellent for Families I have recently returned from the Citigate Central with my partner and also met up with my family over there. Check in was very easy and they gave us rooms next door to each other. The rooms were very clean and comfortable for what we paid and I find any one travelling with a family will not be disappointed with this hotel. The hotel is situated right by the Paddy's Markets (within 2 minutes walk) and two blocks away is the monorail which will take you to the heart of Darling Harbour as well as around the city centre so you can hop off and on where ever you like (AUD9.00 for an all day pass and family passes are cheaper). From Darling Harbour you can catch a ferry around to the rocks (still very cheap about AUD5.00) and have a look around the rocks markets which are fantastic as well as go under the Sydney Harbour bridge and beside the Sydney Opera House. Also from where you catch the monorail you can catch the tram and go to the fish markets for all you seafood lovers. I believe it is definately a great hotel in a prime location without paying the costs of staying in Darling Harbour itself!!!

<Content>Location good, if you can get it cheap I think the moral to the story is that if you can get a good cheap rate and just want somewhere that is reasonable and is close to darling harbour/china town- then this is a good option. If you are looking for romantic/ relaxing / atmosphere- not the place for you.It is certainly adequate and comnvenient but that is about as far as it goes.Staff were very niceNote to smokers- hotel is non smoking now - except for rooms with a balcony- so ask for one of those if you are a smoker

<Content>Great location, but very old hotel I stayed at this hotel in March for 7 days.The hotel is in a great location, been minutes from Central station and the numerous buses down to Circular Quay.The hotel room was very large but also very outdated especially the bathroom which could do with a good clean as well!Considering what we paid for 7 nights, I would not recommend this hotel - however I would recommend this area.

<Content>Bed Bugs Stayed at this hotel for a conference with 8 colleagues. First night noticed bites but thought they were from mosquitoes. Big ones. Then the second night I felt a bite in bed, checked, and bed bug was walking on sheet. Moved bed away from wall and saw 3 more large ones living there. There were also dead ones on the ground. They had been living there for some time. This was about midnight. When I rang downstairs and asked to change rooms, they said none were available. I then asked for spray for the room. 1.5hrs later (nearly 2am!) after I made several more calls to the desk and even went downstairs I got some fly spray. The next morning they apologised and paid for antihistamines, because I was very swollen - I had about 10 bites and I am obviously allergic - very bad reaction. they changed my room that evening but did not offer to spray my belongings.I was not offered a refund for the two nights I slept in a bug room, and found out that they had spare rooms on the second night I was bitten but I was not offered one.

<Content>Functional Clean, good service, well suited for business travelers. Breakfast/Restaurant is average. Wired broadband in the rooms, wireless in the lobby, expensive all round. 5 minute walk to Central Station and Market City. Worth the stay if you are working in this area - otherwise just head further into the city.

<Content>Great Location, Nice Hotel This hotel is a little hard to find, being tucked away at the end of Thomas Street. Once you do find it however, you realise the perfect location !! Its right near Chinatown, Paddy's Market and an easy stroll to the harbour. The hotel has had a renovation and the foyer, restaurant and rooms are fantastic. The only thing lacking in the room we had was the bathroom. I really despise paying good money for a room only to find it has a shower curtain instead of a glass shower housing (just a little quirk of mine). The hotel itself was quite nice, however, the service was not ideal. The concierge was a little snooty and cleary thought that the cut to my friends leg and buttock sustained from the rough edges of the soap holder where of no great concern. Apart from this, our experience at this hotel was quite good. Ask for a harbour view room if possible!!

<Content>Very dsappointing We stayed at the Citigate last week-end and were very disappointed with the customer service and blandness of the hotel rooms and reception area. There was no storage space for clothing other than hanging space, and the only light in the very small bathroom was over the vanity mirror. After returning from the Mardi Gras Parade at 10.30pm we discovered the hotel bar was closed, and we were told rather curtly we could drink in our room. While the location was good, it does look out onto what looked like a bomb site. The service lift was out of order so the hotel staff had to travel in the guest lifts with trollies etc, and on more than one occasion when the lift arrived it was not possible to get in because of staff transporting dirty crockery linen etc. We stayed with a couple visiting us from the UK and were embarressed at the choice we had made having stayed in much better Sydney hotels in the past for less than we paid at the Citigate.

<Content>Good location, decent hotel, horrible service Citigate Central is in a very good location, less than a minute walk to Chinatown, and 10 minutes to Darling Harbour and Queen Victoria Building. The surrounding area is also very quiet and relatively safe at night. Stayed in an executive room on the 16th floor and the room was very big. The huge bed and sofa were not too comfortable. There were a few stains on the carpet. Room seemed kind of bland and boring. Bathroom was small and cramped. Basically, we felt it was a decent hotel in Sydney for the price we paid.The customer service was very terrible. After arriving early (9AM) from a 14 hr flight from S.F., I was told by a lady in reception my room would not be ready until 2PM, but she would call me first thing if it was ready earlier. After waiting over 4 hours in the lobby and seeing others check into their rooms, I walked up to the reception and asked the same lady if my room was ready. It was. I was sitting 20 feet away from the reception desk and not even a word or a phone call that my room was ready for me. The lady said she would have someone bring my bags up to my room for me. I went up to my room, and waited over 45 minutes for my bags which never came. Went back downstairs and told the lady about my bags. She just replied for me to go see the concierge myself about the bags. I ended up bringing up my bags myself. This lady was one of the rudest, most unwelcoming receptionists I've ever encountered and will be the reason why I never stay at the Citigate Central again.

<Content>Excellent value Our stay at the Citigate Central Hotel was great - the location is fantastic, the staff were always extremely friendly and helpful, the room was very clean and spacious - absolutely no complaints. We got great rates and realised when we got there that it was probably because the hotel is undergoing renovations at the moment, but it didn't affect us in the slightest. (We were up on the 10th floor so lower floors might be affected..not sure though...). We had a room with 2 queen beds and there were 4 of us girls but still more than enough space for all of our suitcases etc. The only thing that went wrong was the hairdryer in the bathroom stopped working on the 2nd day, but a replacement arrived about 5 minutes after we called reception. The little rooftop pool is great, too! Underground parking is also considerably cheaper than other city hotels, so a great deal all round! Will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Stellar Experience Stayed here only one night and was pleasantly surprised by appearance of Citigate and professionalism of front desk staff upon arrival. Was upgraded to one of only four suites on the 18th floor without even asking-the suite was larger than some apartments I've lived in. Travelling with a 2 year old and 3 month old I was impressed they took the time to bump us up and it was greatly appreciated as they could have kept us in a standard room (which I'm sure would have been adequate). Ordered a baby cot which arrived within minutes of checking in and then room service. Food was adequate-soup was excellent. Location was perfect-a 5 minute walk to Central Station so you could stay here and go anywhere easily within city or outer burbs-was a $33 cab ride from the airport. The hotel seems to spring out of nowhere-area is obviously getting developed but if you're not fussy about a harbour view I would forgo all that for pleasant, professional staff and clean, comfortable, reasonably priced room. Would stay here again anytime in Sydney.

<Content>One of the best I've stayed at in Sydney I booked this on a discount website at a very good price and thus didn't know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised by how wonderful the Citigate Central was. It is tucked away on an obscure street but just off a main street (George), and is very conveniently located...a 5 minute walk to Central Railway Station. The front desk staff were VERY helpful and accomodating and gave me my room prior to check-in time. The room was very bright, airy, clean, and modern. Comfortable bed. Great views. Again, very clean. Everything has been recently remodeled and there is still some renovation going on. Nice rooftop pool. One of the best hotels I've stayed at in Sydney.

<Content>OK for the price We got a cheap rate on Secret Hotel deals on lastminute.com, but if we had paid any more, I would have felt ripped off. ROOMS: The rooms were OK- enough for 2 people, but we wanted a triple share, so things were very crowded. Also, no extra linen or cups etc were brought up for the third person, even after the second day. We had to ask every day for the extra's. The bathrooms have not been done up, so are very old and needing a renovation. The rooms are not very quiet- we could here EVERYTHING that went on in the room next door, to the point where we nearly left. As for the room cleaning, where do I start???? It was truly terrible. One day (as a joke between ourselves to see if it would be cleaned) we deliberately left a used coffee cup on the floor and some screwed up paper nearby- it was all still there in the afternoon and the cups were not replaced with clean ones.LOCATION: The location is just on the outskirts of Chinatown, so pretty close to everything. No complaints re the location for the price- there are hotels that are in much better areas, but they are also much more expensive.PARKING: Parking is about the cheapest in Sydney at about $12 a night. It is usually about $25 a night elsewhere.OVERALL:I would stay here again if the price was right, but wouldn't spend over $150 a night for it. Just not worth more. The downstairs service was good and the desk staff were really lovely, but room service and cleaning was TERRIBLE!!

<Content>Not bad and reasonable value for Sydney Stayed at the Citgate for two nights at the end of November. I found the overall experience satisfactory and felt with the deal I had got which included breakfeast at $AUD189 per night was reasonable value for Sydney.The hotel is really a typical four star property (even though they give themselves 4 1/2) and I found it to be clean, and reasonably maintained with large rooms and relatively comfortable beds. The reason I say it is 4 star is it just lacks some of the trappings of luxury required to be at that next level.My overall experience with the staff was generally positive although the desk staff need a little more training as a few of my simple requests confused them pretty quickly but they were at least polite.My only minor negatives are the lifts which are inadequate and at peak times are painfully slow, and the location. It is not a particularly pretty part of Sydney but luckily the nicer surrounds of Darling Harbour  Cockle Bay are only a 10 min stroll away. Overall if you are in town and only require somewhere to lay your head that a) isn't a dump but b) isn't going to break your budget, then the Citigate fits the bill nicely.

<Content>Friendly welcoming service. Check the various 'last minute' type websites for great value packages for this hotel. Had the best time on a dinner bed and breakfast 'Spring Package'. The location was perfect for what we wanted - access to Darling Harbour and the Capitol Theatre. The executive king room offered on this deal was very spacious and clean and on the top floor with city views.Service throughout was helpful and professional. We especially enjoyed the taste and presentation of the meals at dinner in the restaurant. This was a great hotel and represented exceptional value comparatively for Sydney accommodation.

<Content>$29/day for internet access? Outrageous Citigate charges 55 cents a minute for broadband internet access, to a maximum of $29/day. I found this shocking. Why would a business traveller want to stay here? I certainly won't stay there again.Other than the unreasonable internet use charge, the hotel was your basic business-chain-buys-an-older-hotel-and-rebrands-it. A few rough edges, but overall a reasonable place to stay. Somewhat characterless, in the way that most business-style hotels are.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! Booked this place on wotif.com and got a great deal. Included Queen bed, Parking and Breakfast.Staff were fantastic and happy to help with anything, even the house keepers were very happy and chirpy in the mornings. The room must have been renovated within the last 12 months because it was fantastic, new looking paint, bathroom looked modern, no leaky taps! Fridge is tiny, can only fit one 2L bottle in there. The bed was fantastic, big queen bed with fantastic quilt.plenty of carparking, so this is not an issue.Will be staying here again for sure!

<Content>Great hotel Stayed in the Citigate Central for 3 nights initially and for a further 2 on our return to Sydney. The first room we had was fabulous, obviously recently decorated and huge. Very large bed and a full size desk and sofa. The staff were extremely helpful even allowing us to leave some items which we would collect on our return. The hotel is in China town behind Darling harbour and within easy walking distance to the major sights. Taxis and public transport are cheap and plentiful. The hotel is very close to the Central Railway station, be careful if arriving very late at night, there are a lot of homeless and drunk people lying around, although they did not harrass us in any way just a bit nerve racking in a strange city. Also note that if you are arriving at the airport late at night and intend to use the train, the cashier desks close and you need the correct money for the ticket machines. On our return the room was not quite as good but still spacious and comfortable. The hotel is undergoing renovation according to the reception staff. All in all a good, comfortable hotel that is value for money. I would stay again if I return to Sydney

<Content>Good Service, room ok We stayed her for two nights over Easter (2A 2C). The hotel has just been taken over by the Citigate Group and is in the process of being rebranded. We have stayed here several times( as Carlton Crest Hotel) as it is close to Darling Harbour, Paddys Market, Syd Entertainment Centre and China Town. The hotel has its own car park which offers a discount rate, and due to the design of the hotel (seven floors of parking, then about eight floors of Hotel) you get virtually no street noise, a real bonus. Try to book a balcony room on floor eight, some of which have a garden/pool view.Check in staff excellent, pleasant and helpful. Rooms are on the smaller side, but clean and adequate. Room service meals were quick and the quality good, however the choice is a little limited. Great shower (heaps of pressure and no lack of hot water). We had breakfast in the Bezzara Cafe which was very good, plenty of choice and a buffet that was being constantly serviced.Now Negatives, only a couple. The bed was very 'firm' and resulted in a sore back for both myself and my wife. The Bathrooms need renovation (generally tired with taps hard to turn off (people without a firm grip would have trouble turning the taps), cracked tile etc, but still clean). Although we booked for 2A  2C when we arrived we did not have sufficient towels, this was fixed in less than 3 minutes after a call to reception, fastest houskeeping service I have encountered!Overall we had a good stay and would stay again. Room Rates are excellent for the area.

<Content>Good Value Nice rooms. close to monorail, Chinatown. 15 minute walk to Darling Harbor. Helpful staff. In-hotel restaurant was mediocre. Good wired in-room broadband internet access but expensive at $Au 0.55/min, max $Au 29 /day. All-in-all a pleasant stay at a resonable price.Note: While we were there, this hotel was in the process of being re-named as Citygate Central, but as of 3/29/07 it is still listed as Carlton Crest on their website. This may change in the near future.
