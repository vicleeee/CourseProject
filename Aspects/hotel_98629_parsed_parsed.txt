<Content>Beautiful hotel, but customer service needs improvement The Rosewood Crescent is an impressive sight... The building is huge, and has a secluded plaza on Cresecent Court that is both cozy and elegant. When arriving, the place is clearly top notch. The lobby is beautiful, and nicely adorned with Christmas decorations (including a big tree, and a huge gingerbread house that was nothing if not impressive). It is clean, updated, and comfortable. Our room was big, the bed comfortable, and all of the details taken care of to a T. We had a nice flat screen TV, full wet bar, and other amenities expected of such a high end hoteI. THe gym and spa are also ample and pristine, and the pool looked nice, but we did not use it as it is outdoors. The only thing we weren't keen on was the elevator bank, which only had 2 elevators that didn't work too quickly... but not a huge deal.The high caliber physical attributes of this hotel made us all the more surprised at the subpar customer service and general friendliness. Our first impression was not a good one. Although we arrived on schedule at about 2:30pm, we were told (rather bluntly, and in an unfriendly manner) that our room was not ready due to cleaning, and to check back in 25 minutes. To make up for it, the check-in guy phoned in a comp for some free Starbuck's coffee next door - which we appreciated. We were less comforted by the coffee, however, when two HOURS later, we still did not have our room. This was not amusing. If it had been an isolated incident I would let it go, but as this was a family wedding, we had the chance to hear the stories from numerous other guests. Shockingly, most of us had surprising wait times to get checked into our rooms (ranging from half an hour to more than 2 hours). The reason was always cleaning. Not acceptable for such a place.The valet service was quick, but the staff also generally unfriendly. No service with a smile there. We also had a lost item in the banquet hall where the reception had been held. We called to see if the staff could retrieve it, and they said it was gone... Of course, no one had actually looked, because we later found it just where she had left it. F for effort.Lastly, the maid service was overdone. It seemed like every time we got back to our room, someone had rearranged everything... including all of our clothes and personal belongings. This was unnecessary, and a burden, as we kept needing to sort through it all to our clothes. Unnecessary, and perhaps if they spent less time mettling with our stuff and instead focused on preparing rooms for guests, people could get checked in faster. Just a thought. In summary, the place was great, but for the price and for an individual, find another nice hotel in Dallas that has friendlier more helpful staff. For large events, this might be the place to go regardless, as it's quite elegant and impressive, and HUGE!

<Content>A perfect weekend!! We had a wonderfully perfect weekend! It was our anniversary and we wanted to get away without going to far. The service was so friendly and accommodating. The Spa was an escape and getaway. The rooms were nice and well appointed. So much to do right there in the area! Can't wait to go back!

<Content>Great hotel, great location! This was our first stay at the Crescent Hotel. The hotel is lovely and the location is fabulous. The lobby is beautiful, very clean outdoor pool area, and nice grounds overall. Check in was quick and smooth and our deluxe room was large and very clean. Very comfy beds and nice quiet rooms. We had the continental breakfast delivered to our room and it was fine. Great shopping right outside the hotel and neighboring hotels are within walking distance for those in need of a night cap and change of scenery!

<Content>Elegant Hotel This was my second stay at the Crescent Court in Dallas. It is a bit pricey for Dallas ($350 the night I stayed), but worth it. It is located on the edge of the central business district and adjacent to an entertainment and restaurant corridor. Despite being so close to several busy streets, there is absolutely no street noise whatsoever. The interior is understated but decidedly upscale and elegant. Not flashy, but more old money, like many of its clientele. Service is personal and first rate, as would be expected of a property of this caliber. Upon entering my room, I found a hand written note from the manager, plus a chocolate cowboy boot filled with candied pecans from the hotel kitchens. Nice touch.

<Content>excellent and convenient I stayed here for 2 nights during a business trip.This hotel is very comfortable-the rooms are spacious, the pool area is serene and the complex that the hotel is great- with great shops, Nobu and starbucks. I also loved the gym and spa. My one complaint is that I didn't think the staff , especially the concierge, was very helpful or friendly..

<Content>Really very good indeed Stayed here for two nights in February 2008 as had meetings in the Crescent Court office complex. Started well by having my car whisked away without fuss as I pulled up, and then being upgraded to a suite. The rooms are very well finished, and the everything was very comfortable. My only gripes are the lack of wireless internet in rooms and the fact that my early morning breakfast went AWOL (they rushed up a fresh order, but still charged for it despite being an hour late). Nevertheless, everything else was very good. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Very Good hotel Wonderful staff, great rooms and OK location make this hotel a very good place to stay. However, the poor restaurant staff, arctic air conditioning temperatures and hectic party scene detract from the hotel. In all, this reviewer mildly recommends staying at the Rosewood Crescent Court.First the problems:- the restaurant was beautiful, yet the staff seemed so distressed I actually was worried about one waiter's health. He was sweating all over the place (including in the food), clearly was on the verge of a nervous break down and was literally so ill that he poured coffee all over my mother-in-law and hardly could muster an apology.- for some reason, the hotel management decided high fifties is a reasonable temperature to set the A/C on. Bring a sweater, this place is freezing!- we had to contend with two booze powered reception/weddings with just hundreds of people wandering and stumbling around. All over the place, the hotel lost control of the party goers and it really detracted from the quality of the stay for the guests.The positives:- the staff was very cordial and nice throughout our stay.- the rooms were beautiful, well maintained and clean.- the location of the hotel was OK, but having seen Dallas now I know that a great location doesn't really exist.Despite the challenges we had during our stay, the positives outweighed the negatives, therefore this reviewer mildly recommends staying at the Rosewood Crescent Court.

<Content>Great place in Dallas I've never been to Dallas, so I didn't know what to expect. I joined a friend of mine on this trip to visit her relatives, and we were pleasantly surprised. We stayed at Hotel Crescent Court which is a beautiful hotel with an equally fabulous spa. The hotel is located in what they call Uptown, a bit different from NY's version of Uptown, but it was nice nonetheless. My girlfriend and I ate at Nobu, which was relatively easy to get into, considering the NY Nobu's are much harder. Some great shopping at a store called The Shak, though crazy expensive. The spa was great....staff were sooooo nice and the massage I got was awesome. Our room was spacious and comfortable....cool dual head showerhead!

<Content>Fantastic stay - are the other posters staying in a different place? I stayed here recently to go to a game at American Airlines Center. I booked the basic level room which was lovely. Looked pretty new to me with flat screen TV and everything I could want. The staff were all so friendly and helpful, the breakfast was fantastic and the restaurant is so nice and relaxing looking out over a pretty courtyard. We walked to and from the game which was only about 10 minutes away. After the game we came back and went to Nobu where there was a real party atmosphere.Didn't get to use the spa, but worked out in the fitness center and it was huge for a hotel. I would defnitely stay here again.

<Content>This Hotel Has Gone Downhill My one night stay in a suite summarized as follows:PROS: 1) staff very helpful as they have been during every stay I can remember. 2) front-desk manager did deduct $200 from my room charge because of problems I encountered the first night. CONS: 1) room temp 65 degrees when I arrived. 2) living room phone had so much static that it was unusable. 3) complained to front desk about problems 12 after I arrived, and then was unhappy to find that when I returned 7 hours later, neither had been fixed. 4) service crew returned and finally fixed the thermostat issue. 5) the phone problem was not corrected during my stay. 6) next morning tried to use the coffee maker and found previous user's coffee grounds pouch still it it, and the beaker had not been washed - YUK!!!. 7) the room has large door windows that let in significant noise from the motorcourt below. 8) I called Rosewood Hotels office to complain about this problems, but the manager never returned my call. CONCLUSIONS: Have stayed here many times since the hotel was first built. This was my worst visit so far and the hotel appears to be in decline. I do not plan to return, especially since the Mansion and the Four Seasons Las Colinas provide outstanding alternatives.

<Content>DIsmal Hoitel Hotel is managed by Rosewood which does a good job at its Cabo property but this one needs serious improvement.Where do I begin?1/ Service, average to poor with a significant snobbish character.2/ Rooms, borderline dirty and smelled of mold3/ Common grounds appear nice but don't look to close.I would only stay at this hotel if the much better Hotel Zaza accross the street is sold out.

<Content>Great place, but could use updating! We went back to the Crescent for our 5th anniversary. I was excited because I couldn't remember even what the room looked like from the first time. At the time, this was the first luxury hotel I had stayed in and I have been spoiled ever since. Now seeing it again, it's beautiful and classic, but it needs some updating. We wanted our original suite (458), but a party had booked it. OK, my husband got us in for the suite next door. So we arrive and whoever this party was had taken that one too! They had us in another suite on the second floor, except it wasn't going to be ready for 45 minutes! And this was at 3:30 pm which is well into check in time. Don at the desk was cool though and got us into yet another suite immediately. He said something at the time that it was going to be on the outside instead of facing the interior courtyard and asked if that would be a problem. I understand now why this was a concern. It was a great corner suite, but the insulation is so bad and we had so many French doors, we heard every single car, truck, motorcycle and plane that went by! One set of doors banged every time the wind blew. Room 400 was quite noisy.Also, the bathrooms need bigger tubs and the beds could be more comfortable. The linens and duvets were nice, but the mattress was too hard for my taste. The management very kindly sent us a dessert for our anniversary which was very cool! The staff were all very friendly giving greetings and asking if we needed assistance.I'll write another review for our dinner in the Crescent Club (fabulous!), but for this forum...it was a great experience and we enjoyed ourselves a lot! All in all, we loved our stay here.

<Content>Flawless Hotel! My husband and I got married June 10th, 2006 and we initially spent our honeymoon at Aventura Spa Palace. BUT our first night before we left that monday we spent in Dallas at the Hotel Crescent Court. Oh my gosh! This hotel is number one in everything; style, class, elegance, service, ambiance! We were greeted among arrival and our cute little Ford Ranger felt out of place amongst the Mercedes, BMWs, Hummers, Bentley's and Porsche's. Anyway, my husband had kept this night a surprise for me. He booked a honeymoon package and when we checked in, we were congratulated and immediately upgraded over $200 to the Metropolitan Suite. When we got to our room with the bellman he opened the door and we were standing in a 2 story suite with a spiral staircase a bathroom downstairs and a full bathroom and loft-style bedroom upstairs. We also had a french door balcony that looked over the pool and courtyard. A few minutes later we recieved a cart with freshly chilled champagne, a mini wedding cake with white fondant icing and gooey chocolate inside, fresh flower, and a note from our GM that night. Also in our package was a 3 course meal to be either served at the restaurant or in our room, and breakfast. It was incredible! One of the events that made the night complete was seeing Shaquille O'Neal and the rest of the Miami Heat walk through our lobby! YES, the Miami Heat was staying in our hotel and about to leave for the second game in the NBA finals!! That was awesome! Please stay in this hotel and enjoy it like we did. We actually could have stayed here for our whole honeymoon and that would have been fine!

<Content>Good for business - Look out for Celebs! The Crescent Court is a luxury hotel close to the Amercian Airlines arena in Dallas. I've stayed here many times for business and seen a lot of famous people. Most recently saw the Miami Heat basketball team including Shaq! The hotel is very nice, rooms are not very large, but are very comfortable. The bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever stayed in. I highly recommend the Crescent. If you are looking for something a little more trendy I also recommend Hotel ZaZa (across the street).

<Content>Romantic and beautiful I have to disagree with the response below - there are additional dining options. Palomino, Capital Grille, and Bice are all connected to the hotel. A great variety.The spa is amazing! As is the workout facility. The pool is great as well.The rooms may not be the most modern, but they are very nice. And the hotel itself can't be beat for beauty in Dallas. Another treat is the location - right on the trolly line for McKinney Ave - a street lined with shopping, restaurants, bars  art galleries.Highly reccommended!

<Content>A 4, not 5 star hotel The Crescent Court is a simple 4 star hotel with pretensions greater than it ability. The location is good -- for Dallas. The public areas are beautiful, but the rooms are absolutely no different, in ANY way, than what you would find at any chain business hotel like Marriott or Hilton. In fact, the rooms may be a bit worse. The rooms are already looking a bit dated, they do not have webtv, and the bathrooms are certainly not larger or more nicely finished than you would find in any hotel -- no separate shower stalls here. Another peculiarity is the fitness area and the restaurant. You either have room service or Nobu -- which although tasty is a bit odd for a large business hotel. The fitness center is part of the basement spa, and is only open during the spa's somewhat limited hours, until 7:00 p.m. or so, which is simply not late enough for business travellers. Bottom line -- you undoubtedly could be just as happy, if not happier, at any number of hotels in Dallas for less cost.

<Content>Disappointed with Service I wanted to do something special for our wedding anniversary so I booked a room at the Crescent. The price was steeper than I would normally pay, but being a special occasion, I thought it would be worth it. Unfortunately, that was not the case.I requested that flowers, a fruit basket, and a bottle of champagne be in our room at check in. I was assured that this was not an unusual request (all at my expense), and would be taken care of. When we arrived at the hotel, I asked the front desk if my special requests had been noted in the reservation and was told that nothing special had been noted. Told not to worry, that fresh flowers were placed in every room every day, and that the fruit basket and champagne would be on the way shortly.Needless to say, none of the above materialized. We never did get flowers, not even the ones that are supposedly placed in every room every day. After about two hours I called room service and asked where were the fruit basket and champagne. They delivered a bowl of bananas and apples (yawn), and a bottle of domestic California champagne for over $100 per bottle. I would have happily paid for the items that I requested given the chance.My money and business will go elsewhere when I decide to celebrate a special occasion.

<Content>Lovely Hotel  Stayed for 2 nights during late August. The temperature was 102 both days. Our room was ready early, and we were able to check in by 11:00 AM. Nice  comfortable, with a nice spacious bathroom. The in-room safe did not work and we called down to notify guest services. By the time we returned to the room, after going exploring, the safe had been removed. We went out to dinner and a new safe was in place. Quick and efficient!!Be aware, breakfast is expensive, but very good. If you go at the end of the posted signs, you could get a very overwhelmed server. However, if you arrive when breakfast is just beginning, service is excellent. Valet parking is quick and efficient. Also, if you are staying over a Friday or Saturday night, you will find a lot of traffic coming to the hotel. It looked like NYC gridlock at the valet station, with everyone coming in for their reservations at Nobu, as well as the several private functions going on at the hotel. Although a little out of the way, the hotel does have a dedicated hotel car, which will take you anywhere within a 5 mile radius. We visited the Dallas Art Museum and Nasher Sculpture Garden. Very easy, and when we wanted to return, we just called the driver's cellphone. The spa is great, and very comfortable. Nice massage and a very large exercise area. The lockerooms were not crowded and very clean. All in all, a very romantic location and hotel.

<Content>Sometimes Great, Sometimes Just OK I have stayed at the Crescent Court on numerous occasions and your trip can vary greatly depending on which room you stay in. I have stayed on the upper floor reached by a separate elevator (beautiful!), a huge one bedroom corner suite (also spectacular, even with burn holes in the carpet) and then several regular rooms. The time I paid the most money (for an 8 night stay) per night, I had the worst room for the first five nights, then they switched me to the top floor room. Some of the rooms are very small for what you are paying.Beds are always comfortable and linens are always good quality no matter which room you're in. Maid service is also exemplary. Front desk staff was overall very high quality.BUT, if you are in one of the smaller rooms (say on the second level over the courtyard where the taxis wait for pickups), your room will be small and very noisy, not what you would expect from Dallas' finest hotel.The lobby is well appointed and very comfortable, have actually spent quite a bit of time there. Spa is outstanding, but pricey.Don't understand all the hoopla about the room service carts - that seems to be an industry standard at almost every hotel I stay in. Admittedly, I am in business class hotels alot, but still......All in all, it's a very nice hotel, but you may or may not get a nice room!

<Content>Bad First Impression I stayed at the highly touted Hotel Crescent Court for the first time. Even with a corporate rate it was no bargain so I had high expectations. I was disappointed and will not stay there again. Our room smelled musty / smoky and the decor was no better than the Westin I usually stay in. I asked our bellman for ice which never came. I had problems with the DSL and phones - I was not able to get an outside line therefore not able to access the internet. A desperate situation for a business traveler like me. Next time I'll try Hotel Zaza or Hotel St. Germain BB.
