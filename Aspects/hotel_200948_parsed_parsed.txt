<Content>an uncommonly good value - well done! I just spent a night here passing through Frankfurt - and found this hotel probably the best value for money that I've encountered in some time. Roomy (ok I arrived later in the evening, so I probably got a larger double), interesting room concept, nice extras such as free wifi, teakettle in room, breakfast buffet included in price - with salmon and roe (!!), pleasant staff and a short block away from the train station. The cost was 72 Euros on a last-minute booking through the hotel website.I stayed at the Parkhotel Meridien the week before at more than double the price, which is a hotel with very high comfort and service standards and it was certainly a pleasure to stay there. But for the value-sensitive traveller, one starts wondering why am I paying 21 Euros for internet access? Why when I ask for a late check-out of just one hour, is there a charge of 10 euros (!!). Of course, the bottom line is who is paying the bill, so if cost is a factor for you and you are looking for an uncommonly good standard at a great price, I would recommend the Concorde.

<Content>Great Hotel, Excellent Location, Wonderful Service... Stayed here last year. A wonderful hotel with excellent location, bang opp. the Central Station, very helpful if you want to use frankfurt as a base to visit the nearby areas. The hotel was spotless, had a great breakfast, helpful staff who think of everything. They even have a pool of umbrellas one can borrow on a rainy day, very helpful for travelers. Stayed at the single room, which a bit small but has all you amenities you can think of, including a nice shower.This place gets full fast esp. during Fair shows, so book early. Could not get a room there when I went in Oct last year. Will surely be on my list for my future trips.

<Content>An excellent small hotel My wife and I stayed at the Concorde for 2 nights in early September. We concur heartily with other recent reviews. Kind,friendly and helpful staff. Impeccably clean.Small rooms but very comfortable bed. Breakfast was plentiful,varied and very good.Value for moneyA+. Very close to escalator down to the main rail station. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>What a great find A recent stay at the Concorde Hotel in Frankfurt means I had an opportunity to be welcomed by the friendliest, most helpful and courteous staff of any hotel, big or small, I have ever stayed at. None of the comments have been exaggerated; the Concorde Hotel staff knows how to make you feel at home from the moment you walk through the door. The location is very central with easy access to all kinds of transportation links and just 1 block from the central train station of Hauptbahnhof. The single rooms are small but very well equipped and spotlessly clean. The bonus of a buffet breakfast was a nice extra given what some hotel charge; the food was good with lots of variety. I give the Concorde Hotel 6 out of 5 stars and recommend it to anyone that needs a home away from home while staying in Frankfurt. Thanks again Concorde!

<Content>Clean and convenient location Hotel is super close to the main train station and about 20 min away from the airport by train. Area at night is sketchy with druggies and hookers a few streets over. Wi-fi was free which was a big bonus. If you like to walk, the main sites, the Main river, and the big shopping route are not more than a 20-30 min stroll. You can pretty much cover it all in a couple hours. I was able to get a decent price on it too.The room I had was super small but that doesn't bother me. The furnishings were very modern with an interesting lighting scheme: blue light, orange, white, or all three. It certainly set the mood for a good night sleep. Bathroom was quite clean as well.

<Content>Small Room but Good Service and Very Clean We arrived in Frankfurt on an early morning flight and made our way to the Hotel Concorde. I had researched this hotel on TripAdvisor prior to booking and in the main, most of the reviews of this hotel are an accurate reflection of what to expect. We were only transiting through Frankfurt for one night before travelling via train to Aachen so proximity to the rail station was important. We thought we may have to wait until the checkin time of 1400 hours but thankfully the very polite staff member on reception gladly checked us in and gave us the keys to our room. She was very polite and spoke very good english.Our room was on the 6th floor (and the tiny lift only goes to the 5th floor) so had to carry our heavy bags up one short flight of stairs. Was not too much of a problem though and afterall, we had access to our room much earlier than we thought we would so was appreciative. They did offer to take our luggage up for us but they did not have another staff member on till 0830 and we just wanted to shower and rest so we willingly did it ourselves.The room was tiny and by looking at other photos on this site is it obvious some rooms are larger than others. Only a half window with a view out to the street. For one night it was OK. But the room was very, very clean and well kept. The quirky coloured lighting was obviously a novel idea at the time!As other reviews have noted the area is a little seedy but if you are looking for something close to the rail station, intend to spend one to two nights only, want extremely clean rooms and friendly staff with an OK breakfast, then this hotel will suit you fine. We would definately stay here again if our requirements were the same - transiting for one night only and close to the main train station.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights (June 21-23, 2008). The staff were really friendly throughout our stay. The check in was fast and quick. The lifts and toilets were small but we have enountered this in other hotels in Germany so it wasn't a surprise. We liked our room on the 6th floor - highest level (the lifts only go all the way to the 5th floor, so you have to carry your bags up to the 6th). It was quiet, clean and comfortable. We liked our bed and that they have all the basic amenities - hair dryers, kettle, cups, fridge, tv. One thing I did note was that they did not provide tissue. The breakfasts were reasonable - not great but still did the job of filling us up. On our last day, we moved to a single room for half day due to our last minute late checkout request. (We willingly paid extra for it as we had a very late flight.) The single room was very small. But we felt for one person, it was really okay. Overall, for the price, I would say this hotel is really value for money given its location, cleanliness, staff service.

<Content>Lousy bed, great staff I stayed at the Concorde for 3 nights during a business trip, since the other hotels I normally stay at were booked due to an exhibition at the Messe. I based my stay on the ratings on TripAdvisor.My room was teeny teeny tiny. However, the hotel is recently remodeled and relatively modern. The bed is simply awful. I don't even think it's a twin size, and a very cheap mattress. It felt like I was in College Dorm. Breakfast was included and ok.I've stayed in the Main Train Station (Hauptbanhof) area before, and I do not like this area. It is full of drug addicts and other recalcitrants who frequent major train station areas. The place I do business with is not far away, but this is the last time I will stay in this area. Despite everything, what they say about the staff in these ratings is absolutely 100% true - they are exceptional. However, I also had questions about hotel security. For being so close to the main train station, there were times I would walk in the hotel in the evening after dinner and no one would be at the front desk.If you're on a budget and want a place to stay, I guess it is ok. But I won't be going back.

<Content>Very nice hotel and location So there are few things people complain about here - like small elevator. Well, it is small, but we had smaller on this same trip. You can fit 4 (friendly) people in this or two with a bag each. Worked well for us. Now the shower is a bit small for someone large. Need to be careful how you move around in there.The desk and breakfast staff were very friendly and helpful. We came early and they stored our bags as usual. When we came back, they'd taken them all up to the room for us.Decor is very modern. Wireless internet is fantastic - best I've seen in a hotel anywhere. I had it up with my VPN up for 4 days straight with no drops.Breakfast was very good - buffet with a few hot items and a lot of other things including really fresh fruit and breads.Location? Well, it's great for getting to the station. It's a bit close to the sex club area so don't take a wrong turn at night. Room was very quiet and beds comfortable. All in all, very happy with the place.

<Content>A nice, neat, modern hotel The Concorde is a small, neat, modern hotel that's one notch above average. It is handy to the main railway station. My single room was small but functional -- smaller than all the other rooms on the same floor, according to the fireplan, but I can accept that when I paid only 60 euros through an Internet booking. The room included coffee maker, free wifi (a bit slow), and multi-coloured lighting (!). The design was clean and modern. Breakfast was good. The staff were friendly and helpful.Fire safety: There is an emergency exit in addition to the main stairs. Security: No safe in room. The immediate area of the hotel is okay, but the adjacent block of Moselstr is perhaps the roughest block of a rough area of town; turn right when leaving the hotel and all is fine.

<Content>High Design and Value, Convenient to Train Station Hotel Concorde is located across the street from Frankfurt Hbf train station. From Frankfurt Main airport, it's only 15 minutes to Frankfurt Hbf and back. And there's a station at the airport so it's as convenient as the higher priced airport hotels. The hotel is High Design with mood lighting in the small but well-furnished rooms and baths. Wi-fi is free, as is a continental breakfast. The front desk was helpful in guiding me to a local German restaurant that gave me a wonderful dining experience, only a 15 minute walk away. I didn't think I could get that as easily at an airport hotel. Also, it was fun (and safe) to take an after-dinner stroll along the river front. However, Frankfurt's train station area, like other cities, is where the adult entertainment industry is centralized. You can avoid this district by walking a route recommended by the hotel. Not for travelers with children but perfectly fine for others for a one or 2 night stay in this surprisingly cosmopolitan German city.

<Content>Great Value Wonderful hotel for the price. Short walk from main train station (which is only a 10 minute ride on the S-Bahn regional train from the airport). Rooms are very stylish and clean and the breakfast was terrific. Room size was comparable to other European hotels I've been at (smaller than North American). We had a flight layover and found this hotel location allowed us to arrive quickly from the airport and to spend a few hours the next morning walking around the old city centre and shopping district of Frankfurt before catching the train back to the airport. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you have to overnight between connecting flights.

<Content>Clean and Cool My 16-year old daughter and I met a friend in Germany and stayed at the Concorde in Frankfurt. The hotel was clean and the breakfast was good. There were mood lights (blue, orange of white) over the bed and my daughter thought they were cool. Hotel is near the train station but it's a bit of a walk to other attractions. My daughter didn't like that the shower was kind of in the open with a drape around it (she's quite private) but this didn't bother me at all. The hotel staff was generally friendly and apologized profusely for forgetting my wake-up call (luckily I didn't have a meeting to attend). Only real complaint is that when we asked for directions to an area with a variety of restaurants that we could check out, the staff insisted in recommending a specific restaurant even after we said we didn't want that type of food. I would stay here again.

<Content>Pleasant stay My husband and I spent 1 night here before our flight out of Frankfurt and found it to be one of the better hotels we stayed in in Germany.Location was very handy to the main train station (around 5-10 minutes walk). Christmas markets and the old part of town were about a 20 minute walk away which was fine. Also lots of shops nearby however we arrived on a Sunday so they were closed. Room was a good size and there was free wifi internet access in our room. The mood lighting in the room was quite amusing - you can change it to white light, orange lights or blue. There was also tea/coffee making facilities which were unexpected so a great bonus!

<Content>Small Room, but Big Service. We stayed here for two nights in Dec 2007. If you are planning a short break in Frankfurt, and you do not plan spending much time at the hotel, the Concorde is a good choice. Great location, near to the station and tram lines, it's easy to make your way around Frankfurt from here. The room we had was small but spotless. There are slightly larger rooms on the lower floors so if you are concerned do not accept a room on the 6th floor.Breakfast was a good continental spread with cheeses, hams, sausages, cereals, scrambled eggs, juices, toast, cakes, etc etc. Staff were excellent throughout our stay and we enjoyed returning to the hotel in the evenings for a drink. Prices were reasonable.There is limited parking available nearby in a secure underground car park. Definitely enjoyed our stay and we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. You can expect that the rooms will be small but in excellent condition, and clean. The service is excellent and the breakfast is a very good continental. If you need lavish however, try elsewhere.

<Content>wundebar! Stayed in a junior suite at the Concorde and loved it. The room was spotlessly clean, very spacious, brilliantly designed to maximise the space, lovely high ceilings, huge curtains covering a fairly small window (and naff view but that wasn't an issue at all) and mood lights! The bathroom was part of the room with a shower that is on show (luckily you can pull a curtain around it for privacy if you so wish!!), it was fantastic, wouldn't have changed a thing. Didn't get up for breakfast so can't comment but would definitely stay again.It's situated by the red light district which we didn't find to be a problem. We chose to take cabs at night time, day time was not an issue.Got an excellent rate booking directly. Reception staff extremely friendly and helpful.

<Content>Great ambience but horribly small room. Stayed here for one night for the convenience to the Central Train Station and airport connection. I liked everything about the hotel except the room size. For a single room it was horribly small. It was about the size of an office cubicle! Nicely furnished, wifi, very clean, but all that was meaningless with such an uncomfortably small room. I should have asked for something larger but didn't want to pay extra. I would only stay here again if I could be placed in a larger room that did not face the wall of another building.

<Content>Loved this hotel First time in Germany and used Tripadvisor to the 'max'. This hotel is fantastic, very clean, in a great location and the reception staff were very helpful (especially the Canadian guy). The room was great, the 'lighting' effects and the size of shower, room, breakfast choice, etc made my one night in Frankfurt memorable. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel!The hotel kindly let us leave our luggage there after we checked out, enabling us to see Frankfurt on the tram, underground, river cruise and on foot until our late flight home.
