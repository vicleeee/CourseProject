<Content>Excellent hotel -- wonderful staff! We chose this hotel because of the great reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The hotel is in a great location. If you like to walk, just about everything is within a 10-minute, easy walk in any direction. We were there in the winter and despite the cold it was still very easy to walk. (We also took the metro from the airport and that was very easy.) A great advantage is that in between sites the property is so well-situated you can stop by the room to drop things off or take a quick break. The room we had was nice; not huge but very clean and stylish. We faced right onto the Santa Ana Plaza and based on some other reviews we were worried about the noise, but there are two thick windows and noise wasn't a problem. The hotel lobby is very cool and modern and there was a laptop with free internet access. Breakfast in the restaurant that is connected was very good. Most of all, the front desk staff was exceptionally helpful. Our baggage was lost on our trip over -- in fact it took five days for the bags to be delivered to the hotel. But the Alicia staff was wonderful in calling the airlines and helping us navigate both the lost baggage computer system and the dreadful airline customer service department. A special kudos to Kevin and Allejandro for their persistence on our behalf!

<Content>Alicia - An Excellent Choice I stayed at the Alicia last weekend with my wife for a pre Christmas short notice getaway. I reviewed the Madrid hotel options through Tripadvisor as usual and from the information posted the Alicia seemed to offer the best blend of location, facilities and value for money.We were not disappointed. After an easy Metro ride from Madrid airport, (the Metro departs from the 1st floor of Terminal 2), we took the pink line to Colombia stop, purple line to Principe de Vergara stop, then red line to the Sevilla Metro station stop and walked the short distance to Plaza Santa Ana. I had booked our stay via the hotels web site as I wanted a Junior Suite and had pre-paid for the room so checki-in was fast, efficient and friendly.We were very pleased with the size of the room and its facilities and I'm happy we opted for the higher grade. Our view across the square was excellent - (we were in room 303 on the 3rd floor). Our room was very clean though we noted a slight waft of drains from time to time, (be interesting to know what it was like in the height of summer), but it didn't impact our stay.Facilities were comprehensive - flat screen tv, stereo, room safe, sensibly priced mini bar, plenty of storage and lots of clean fluffy towels. The free standing bath was also a pleasant addition.I have read some comments about neighbourhood noise, but as we visited in December and the weather wasn't great the local square was fairly devoid of people so this wasn't an issue for us.I would also comment that if you want somewhere totally quiet you probably shouldn't stay in the centre of any major city.Breakfast was included and hosted from the tapas bar which is situated in the same block as the hotel. Self service was fine and the breakfast choice was adequate.The location of the hotel is excellent and we covered a vast array of sites within a 20 minute walking radius of our base location.As an aside I would recommend the tapas, wine and general atmosphere in the Vinoteca bar directly across the road from the Alicia as well as a restaurant called Club 31 which is about 10 minutes walk away but very pleasant for a special dinner occasion.Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our trip and would recommend the Alicia to anyone who wants a sensibly priced, very modern and clean hotel in the centre of Madrid.

<Content>Lovely hotel in downtown Madrid We had a one day layover in Madrid and wanted to find a quiet hotel in downtown Madrid close to the subway. Room Mate Alicia was all of the above and more. We were given an upgraded room with a beautiful view of Plaza Santa Ana. The hotel includes free wi-fi which was much appreciated. The room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was nice. Staff were helpful.The location is ideal for tapas restaurants and sightseeing - close to the major museums. It is also a short (5-10 minute) walk from the Metro, which we took to/from the airport. We had been most concerned about noise from the busy street, but the sound insulation was excellent.In the Spanish style, the breakfast doesn't begin until 8 am. Because of our flight time, we missed the breakfast.

<Content>Perfect Alicia Stayed at the Alicia for 4 nights at end of October. Booked shuttle with Aerocity to get to hotel from airport (instructions to check in at airport were not clear) but after the delay the service was excellent.Check in at hotel was swift and staff very friendly and spoke perfect english. Free internet in lobby and when I needed boarding cards printed for return flight the staff were again very helpfull.Booked executive room which had a terrace. Room great with nice firm bed, bathroom also good with nice toiletries.Breakfast was superb with plenty of choice. Free newspapers.Location of hotel on corner of Plaza Santa Ana could not be better,within 10-15 minutes walk of all the major attractions.Plenty of bars and restauants in the vicinity (Ginger restaurant was superb and great value).

<Content>Brill Hotel  Had lovely stay at your hotel, got lucky ..sunshine in November.Hotel staff were all very helpful and gave us some restaurant suggestions when we were looking for something specific.Our room had a view of the square but we noted room 203 was on the corner and probably a better option.House keeping was superb and the decor of room modern  fresh, we didn't mind the open plan shower ......quite fun !! Shutters and double glazing made up for potential noise which comes from street . Not party goers but cars and their peeping horns !! This hotel is on one of the lovliest squares in Madrid ...visit and enjoy the people watching. XX

<Content>great hotel, great value, great location ... to bad for the A/C My wife and I stayed ther this past October. Its a marvelous hotel, quite chic, and nice cozy rooms. The buffet breakfast is outstanding, and not only for european standards.The location, though a 5min walk to the nearest metro station (Anton Martin), its very convenient. Right infront of Plaza de Santa Ana, and a 10min walk to Sol, Gran Via, Atocha Station, etc....The only incovenience we found was that the AC system wasnt working, due to the fact that its centralized and switched to heat for the cold season. But it was raining outside, so having the windows opened was not an option, nor turning on the AC (or heat). So we had to manage ourselves to cool down a bit. That aside, I would definetely recommend the hotel, and for sure, make sure the next time, either the AC works properly, or rain/snow is not forecasted !

<Content>Good location, nice staff, but area is full of thieves Stayed here on Nov 15 on a layover through Madrid. The hotel is sufficient, and the staff is nice, but please be aware when you check in to this hotel. The area the hotel is located in is on a busy square in downtown Madrid. The area is full of bars and restaurants, which are extremely busy at night. The one-way street in front of the hotel gets backed up with cars due to the congestion of people in the area, so cars are honking all night long. I could not get to sleep until after 2am, as every minute or two I could hear the loud honking of horns from the street below.Additionally, be VERY CAREFUL with your belongings when checking in to this hotel. I was robbed while checking in. I had 4 pieces of luggage. The taxi guy dropped me off immediately in front of the main door (4 feet away). I drug all my bags into the lobby, and went to the desk 15 feet away. The check in was quick, and when I turned around to get my bags, one was missing. The front desk clerk said this is a common problem in the area. The staff were friendly and helpful after my loss, but please be VERY careful, as the area this hotel is in has a very high rate of crime - verified to me by the local police when I filed a report.

<Content>loved the Alicia The hotel was wonderful. Perfect location with easy walking or metro to anywhere. Very close to all the Art Museums and other sites. The breakfast was fresh and varied and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The room itself was terrific with comfortable beds, modern, funky decor and nice toiletries and a full wall of window. The bathroom is open concept, which was new for us, but it was all quite cleverly designed and worked well. I would not hesitate to recommend it.

<Content>Who needs a Spa? We stayed in the Room Mate Alicia on Plaza Santa Ana. The location was fantastic, right on the corner of one of the liveliest squares in Madrid. The corner room (a Junior Suite) was comfortable and airy. The large double bed was a real double, rather than two singles pushed together with a gap to fall through. This was the most comfortable hotel bed I have slept in for a long time. The decor was more Habitat than hotel chain.Ok, so the Alicia does not have a health spa, wireless internet, 24 hour room service or any of the other services that a hotel seems to need to improve its star rating at the expense of the comfort of its rooms. What it does have is a left luggage service on check out day so you don't need to cart your stuff around until the late afternoon EasyJet flight to Gatwick, giving you a whole extra morning to enjoy Madrid. It also has friendly, helpful staff, comfortable rooms, a fabulous location, and electric roller blinds to play with when bored. All in all, thoroughly recommended.

<Content>Great position This hotel has a great position -- near to all the major sites and to lots of good restaurants. Our initial room was an internal one - it was dark and too hot (though the outside temperature was cool) - the air conditioning was turned off; we got moved to a room with an external window, which was much pleasanter - the double glazing is good, so we weren't bothered by noise from outside. The 'open plan' shower/toilet arrangements are fine - except if one person needs to get up at night and turn the lights on! The hotel staff were all very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable.

<Content>An Excellent Choice Room Mate Alicia is a very modern smaller hotel in a nicely renovated 100 year old bulding. Ceilings are high and rooms are well equpped and larger than European norm. The location is superb, in the old historical centre, on a plaza with a selection of about 10 restaurants and bars that serve tapas. The Prado and Thyseen Museums are a short walk. Front desk staff are multilingual, including excellent English and are very helpful. Parking is available in a municipal lot under the plaza but is expensive at about 27 euros per day.

<Content>Very nice terrace! We stayed in one of the 2-floor suites at Room Mate Alicia in Madrid for 4 nights. The room was great, comfortable even for 3 people with the third downstairs on the pull-out sofa (extra 50 euros or so charge for another person). The wifi worked well, the staff were very nice, and the location was perfect. The best part of the room was that it had its own terrace/patio outside with several chairs, a sunbathing-type couch/lounge for two, and a fountain/small unheated pool. The only negative is the parking garage entrance in the plaza next to the hotel, because many cars honk repeatedly.

<Content>Fantastic hotel in a Great lodation. We stayed at this hotel in March 08 and was booked as a long week-end for 2 couples who enjoy city breaks.We arrived before the check-in time and were able to leave our bags at the hotel, so we could have a coffee, we asked the reception staff if we could have 2 outside facing rooms as we had heard the inside ones were dark.On returning to check in we had been moved and given 2 outside facing rooms as we had requested, the rooms are very modern and perfect for a short stay, our only dislike was the open plan style bathroom, and that we due to the fact if you got up in the night to use the toilet you had to put a light on as the rooms are pitch black and therefore you end up disturbing you partner with the bright lights, also the room walls are not very thick.The breakfast was fine, the staff in the resturant a bit on the slow side.The hotel is self is in a fantastic location overlooking Plaza Santa Ana......A great location far better than many other hotels we saw during our stay....The reception staff were extreamly helpfull with all our questions and went out of their way to be of assistance.All in all a great value hotel in a perfect location, and a hotel i would recomend and use agian.

<Content>Excellent experience Great location of Madrid. We walked everywhere and got it all in. Recent renovation with new and modern features. Staff was the best. Monce' could be a travel agent with her knowledge of restaurants and clubs. She and Jorge were very helpful in helping us secure additional nights during a busy Masters Tennis weekend after we decided last minute to stay the weekend instead of travel to Malaga. Breakfast was excellent too.The only complaint was the sound proofing between the door and hallway. Between the room and outside is excellent, no street noise at all, but the doors seem to need some insulation... minor complaint.

<Content>A wonderful place! I found the Room Mate Alicia to be almost perfect -- the best (and liveliest) location in Madrid, yet, with double-glazed windows, restful and quiet when that's what you want. The design concept is clever and fun without getting in the way, the breakfast in the adjacent restaurant is fine, and the staff are always helpful. I can't think of anything to complain about, except that I couldn't stay in Madrid longer...

<Content>Cool tourist hotel Interesting hotel in excellent location. While we stayed at Room Mate Alicia, we did check out a couple of other Room Mate locations not far away and thought they were a little more interesting as far as concept and design were concerned. The lobby is small, chic... laptop computer on counter for anyone to use. Small elevator; small-ish, but comfortable room; no iron/board in room, no coffeemaker or hot-pot; decor minimalist and modern, bed fairly comfortable. Had inside room so noise not an issue, but only had natural light through breezeway. When blinds open, you could see directly into the opposing room (good for some, I suppose). TV only seemed to get Spanish and German channels--on and off we did get CNN international. No clock in room. The carpet was a new, but thin and unpadded, berber.Shower (no bathtub in our room) is en-suite  the floor-to-ceiling glass door was annoyingly difficult to open. No light in the shower area  the shower enclosure itself was black... some of the glass door was frosted, so little light projected into the shower space. Though I do not require a spotlight to cleanse myself, I found the experience to be something like showering in a vertical sarcophagus. The door to the W/C  basin was a large (floor-to-ceiling) sliding mirror-covered apparatus that did not close sufficiently for my discretion.There was no room service, but breakfast at the adjoining tapas bar (converted to a breakfast room for hotel guests in AM) was ample in quantity and fairly good--it was included in my Expedia rate, too.I would stay here again if I got a good rate. We had stayed at Hotel 1898 at the beginning of our trip in Barcelona and thought that place was marvelous. Unfortunately, the price differential was not as great as the difference in quality and service, though I do not think Hotel RM Alicia is bad at all.

<Content>Trendy, friendly  I stayed in one of the three Junior Suites on the building's corner, with views on the Plaza Sta Ana. So this review does not concern the other types of accommodations. The room was spotlessly clean with nice design furniture, comfy firm bed, the internet connection (once you got the password from the reception) worked flawlessly. Great walk-in shower. the best though was the deep-soak bathtub in the corner of the actual bedroom... pure heaven after a day walking around.Reception hall is small but functional, staff was efficient, I didn't try the Tapas Bar / breakfast.Slight minus: all stores and curtains were electric and there were no less than 20 switches on the walls to open, rotate or close them, it took quite a while to work out which was which. And some didn't work, meaning that I could not fully dim the light. So I took another bath instead...

<Content>Love Madrid, love Alicia! As most other reviewers have commented, the Alicia is in a superb location overlooking Plaza Santa Ana. Close to the Metro and hundred of places to eat and drink close by.We treated ourselves to Suite Duplex (Room 401/501) and it was superb. So much space and a delightful terrace overlooking Santa Ana. We spent much more time at the hotel than we normally would because of this so felt we got good value for money. We were even able to have a late night hail throwing party on our terrace after an absolutely incredible hailstorm. A bizarre experience! If you don't like street noise then this may not be the hotel for you - that is the price to pay for the excellent location. Madrilenos really know how to party - every night of the week! For us it wasn't a problem and really added to our experience of this vibrant city.Staff at the hotel were excellent and very friendly. The room had everything we needed and more. The maid could have been a bit more thorough at times (used glasses not changed) but this was not a problem.Breakfast was included in the price and there's a decent selection of fresh fruit, cold meats and cheeses etc. Being a coffee snob I found the filter coffee undrinkable but the staff will rustle up a cortado for you (although they may not smile whilst doing it!).All in all, a fantastic trip and great second stay in Madrid. I would highly recommend the Alicia and in particular the Duplex - if you can afford it then it really is worth it.

<Content>Great hotel in a fab location A great value, modern hotel in an excellent location. Right on the Plaza Santa Ana with it's numerous bars and restaurants. Good central location within walking distance of most tourist areas within the city. Hotel staff couldn't be more helpful - very pleasant. And yes the shower / sink in the bedroom could be difficult for 'non-couples'. Breakfast was perfectly adequate (cold cuts, cheese, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, pastries etc. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it!

<Content>Coolest Hotel on the Planet A fantastic hotel. Perfect location near all the great bars and restaurants, and yet superbly soundproofed so no noise to disturb you if you ever decide to go to bed!Room layout good - but would recommend some barrier to stop water from the shower getting the carpet wet!Receptionist superb and really helpful.One of, if not the best place I've ever stayed at

<Content>Mixed bag...not for us.... Booked hotel after reading excellent reviews on this site. Definately a mixed bag experience.We found the complaints about noise worrisome so we took along earplugs. Booked a 5 night stay in a Junior Suite (Room 303). Our 5 night stay was 1000 Euros. It included breakfast in the Tapas Restaurant next door.The desk is very helpful. Nice young people working it. I asked for extra hangers (no drawers in the room though an ample closet) and they beat me back up to the room with them. I asked for directions several times and they were very pleasant with assistance and recommendations. I was warned not to wear my tiny daypack on my back but rather to carry it in front of me. Wise advise as we witnessed one successful pick pocket incident and saw and thwarted a second during our stay. The desk helped me confirm our international flight, checked the weather report, made restaurant recommendations, etc. All cheerfully. The facilities are modern. I understand the hotel was rennovated about 2 years ago. Mod looking white lobby with a circular stair case up to the rooms (also an elevator). The junior suite was great. Quite large. A king size bed with side reading lamps and end table space for both of us. The room had a large sitting area with a circular coach, chair, lamps, end tables. It overlooked the Plaza de Santa Ana. We had an awesome view. Some nites we would come back and have a glass of wine in the room while people watching from above. The room is a corner room (this particular junior suite) and essentially 2 of four walls were glass. The hotel sits on a corner of the square (Southeast?) So our Corner looked directly out on the Plaza.As others have noted in reviews the bathroom situation is a bit different. The tub sits in it's own little nook off to the side of the sitting area. Full window in front of it. Obviously you can pull the blinds. It is a nice deep tub. The bathroom is open except for a sliding door for the toilet and a glass door for the shower. I would complain a little about the shower. The hand held shower head is way too high unless you are an Amazon. I am 5'4 and couldn't reach it. I had to have my husband pull it down for me. You had to hold the shower head to take a shower or it sprayed all over the place and out of the containment area. Nice smelling toiletries and they were generous with them.The street noise was non existent. We expected this to be a problem. It was not. Not only do they have thick glass windows but they have two sets of them! There were controls that allowed you to either lower blackout blinds or pull veritical blinds across all windows (although one of our vertical blinds was faulty). It took our full 5 days to figure the 21+ electric controls/switches in the room!The breakfast was ample and nice. It included hot and cold items.The room had a desk, TV, mini bar and CD/Radio. Also a safe in the closet. As previously noted no chest of drawers but it had a large closet with some shelving.Three nights were wonderful. The last two were hell. There appears to have been so much attention to detail with regard to street noise but none to internal noise. We had quiet neighbors 3 nights. Nights 4 and 5 showed that if you don't have the right neighbors you will not have a restful stay. Not only can you hear everything that goes on in the next room , you can FEEL IT! The vibrations were as annoying as the thumping and banging. So the Good:Nice location; helpful staff; nice breakfast; and well appointed room.The Bad:Poorly insulated walls between rooms....noisy!; Poor shower design.For us the noise is the deal breaker. Our fourth visit to Spain (first at this hotel). We won't stay here again.

<Content>A great value in a superb location This is a modern, sleek, well appointed and designed hotel located at Plaza Santa Ana, an active area for night life, restaurants and touring. The desk staff were very helpful. Our outside room was designed in such a way that we had a large queen bed, a separate sitting area with a small couch and table along with a great view of the Plaza. The glass shower stall is built right into the main living area of the room which is a little unusual, but it works. The room does not have a tremendous amount of space, but it feels like it does because of the way it's designed. The room was very quiet. The breakfast, included in the room price, had a very nice selection of toasts, pastries, meats, cereals and fresh fruit compotes and coffee and teas. We were particularly impressed when on our last day there was no hot water in the morning, the hotel assured us that the hot water lapse was a fluke and discounted our entire stay by 10%. This hotel is a very good value for the money and we would recommend this property highly to anyone who did not need a very large size room.

<Content>Great location Just got back from a 4 day stay in Madrid. The hotel was excellent. The staff were very helpful and our room was great although a bit noisy as it is right on the square but you're in Spain where no one goes to bed until 5:00 a.m.! The breakfast was super. The hotel is located in a great location and close to everything including a few minutes walk to a Metro station. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>a very good first experience! A very friendly atmosphere and a very good accomodation at all, in an excellent location.Just a note to say that breakfast time needs to be improved, sometimes 7:30 AM is late to start, trains or flights can be early (as during my stay) and I was forced to take a coffee just in the railway station.

<Content>A bit too much noise The hotel is situated on the edge of Plaza Santa Ana which is very lively. Even pulling down the shutter does not take away all the noise so be prepared to be woken in the early hours. There is also a problem with internal noise due to the thin walls between rooms and noise in the corridors. The shower is situated in the room (as mentioned by other reviewers). That was not really a problem to us but the leaking water is a real nuisance as the doors are not completely sealed. Part of the problem is the direction of the shower head which does not move and wastes half the space in the shower. The loo is behind a sliding door, I would definitely have preferred a proper door. Breakfast was included and not bad. Service could have been with more of a smile.All this said, the reception staff are really helpful and friendly. The room is a decent size and looks modern/contemporary. The situation of the hotel is good for lots of restaurants and an easy walk to lots of places. The stay was okay, just not as good as other reviewers had led me to believe it would be.

<Content>Great Location  - Great central location, easy to find- Very friendly service, helpful and informative front desk- Free internet and laptop in lobby- Breakfast included with a good selection- Very clean rooms, clean furniture, clean bedding- Rooms 201-203, 301-303, 401-403, etc are best and most spacious, ask for a room with a view- Thin walls, noisy outside on weekends, and our shower leaked out of the shower onto the carpet forcing us to change rooms, the hotel was efficient in handling the problem

<Content>Superb Location!!! I stayed in Room Mate Alicia for 3 nights at the end of August with a friend on a girls break. Just reinforcing everbodys review the location is fabulous for all the sights, bars, restaurants etc. but on saying this you do not hear any noise as the windows are all really well double glazed. We had a junior suite which had stunning views over the square with floor to ceiling windows and electric blinds. The decor is very modern and clean, probably more pleasing to younger people, they also serve breakfast till 11.30 for the party people, but on saying that it would suit and age group. The staff were very helpful and advised us on a theatre visit to a flamenco ballet and also tour guides. The breakfast is not the best but coffee, juice, toast, pastries, fruit all the usual but basic on the cooked selection.My top tip for a visit to madrid is to catch the sightseeing open top bus on the first day,this is a great way to get your bearings and work out what you want to see,it also helps on the sore feet. Ask on hotel reception they sell tickets and will direct you to the nearest stop. I though Madrid was great and would definately recommend room mate alicia.If you are a party person, go to Penthouse bar on the opposite side of the square. You go up in a lift to a rooftop which is amazing and has great views of the square. There is no charge so go and check it out.

<Content>Great Place in Great Location! My husband and I stayed here for three nights at the end of our honeymoon. Hotel Alicia is located in a wonderful spot, in between the Plaza Mayor and the Prado Museum. There's a cute little plaza just outside the front door with various outdoor eating/drinking options.The staff at Alicia were all helpful and efficient. They assisted us with picking out great restaurants, directions, etc. The hotel had a free breakfast at the next door tapas bar. It included a nice spread of cheese, fruit, bread, and also eggs, bacon, and sausage.We loved our room. We had an executive room which included a private balcony. The room was kept very clean and used the space appropriately. There was plenty of shelf/storage space and a nice-sized bathroom. We couldn't say enough nice things about the room. (We also peeked into some of the suites as they were being cleaned and they looked great.) The whole style of Alicia is very modern.

<Content>Wonderful Stay at Alicia We hada great time at the Alicia. The hotel is excellently located and is withiin a short walk to the Plaza Mayor, Plaza Del Sol, Atocha rail station, the Prado, the Thyssen museum, The Reina Sofia and so much more. The rooms are on the small size with shower only (no bath) but are functional and clean and have modern decor and amenities (plasma TV, safe etc). The staff are very helpful and fluent in English, The guy who was on eve shifts was especially helpfull in recommending restaurants etc. Thanks. (you should go to the La Vaca Argentina which is a few blocks away and has very good steak for a decent price).Breakfast is very good with okmletes, cold cuts and juice and fruit. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay and will recommend the hotel to all.

<Content>great location The Alicia has a great location right on the Plaza Santa Ana in the middle of Madrid. All the main sights are walking distance from here and the Plaza itself has numerous bars, restaurants etc (Our favourite was called Lateral for great tapas).The hotel itself is modern and clean and there is a complimentary buffet breakfast at the adjoining restaurant.

<Content>Perfect location, great hotel This is a great boutique hotel in the centre of Madrid, within walking distance of almost everything you will want to see. Breakfast is included and is served until the leisurely time of 12 noon. The staff are really friendly and helpful and the place is spotlessly clean.You may not want to stay here if you are planning on sharing a room with anyone other than your partner, as the bathroom arrangements are very in your face - the shower is in a glass cabinet in the middle of the bedroom! It looks stunning, but I can see that it may put some people off.My first visit to Madrid and I can highly recommend both the city and this hotel.

<Content>Stylish hotel in great location Perfect location in Madrid with a stylish and cool reception area and a great room. Well worth paying the extra for a terrace as this effectively doubles the size of the room in the summer - you get a big double sun lounger and an outside shower. Only complaint would be that there was too much furniture in the room! It meant that there was less space than would have been ideal. But very much recommended.

<Content>Fantastic choice for a family stay We loved everything about the Room Mate Alicia. It's hard to know what to add to the positive reviews everyone else has written -- fantastic location, quiet, great breakfasts. We stayed there as a family of four, with our 13 and 10 year old daughters. The duplex suite is a great option for families. It gave everyone the privacy they needed, with the private terrace and plunge pool being a perfect way to get together. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Room Mate Alicia to anyone!

<Content>Loved Room Mate Alicia Location, location, location!This hotel is perfectly located for those that are traveling for pleasure or business in Madrid. Our stay was for pleasure and it was a family trip.The staff was very helpful and allowed us an early check-in. They were eager to help with recommendations and making reservations at local restaurants, theaters and other places of interest.Both the rooms and the decor of the hotel were above average and the value for the rate was excellent. Similar hotels in this area charged up to two times the rates. You have to be comfortable not having the amenities of four/five star hotels (like room service, a hotel spa or meeting rooms). However, this hotel chain makes up for it in its service, staff and value.Myself and my whole family will stay in this hotel in future travel to Madrid and I would recommend it to anyone traveling to Madrid in the future. Also, based on my experience with Room Mate Alicia I will consider using any Room Mate hotel in other cities.

<Content>Enjoyed very much our stay and appreciate very much help from the staff we have a family of 4 and need 2 double rooms. By mistake on the internet booking, we only have 2 single rooms available during check-in. The receptionist, Antonio was so professional and he handle well for our booking and we really appreciate very much for his service. Not only that, Antonio also helped me to coordinate with the car rental booking and so helpful to us. What a nice hotel, the room was clean and quiet. We also enjoyed very much the buffet breakfast.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel in madrid We arrived in Madrid late Friday evening for a weekend stay and the Room Mate Alicia represents one of the best 'value' stays I have had in recent years.Whilst this is not a 'spa' hotel where you come to relax, it is however an extremely well designed and well decorated hotel that is a very comfortable place to rest your head for a few days.The modern room decor and lay out may not be everyone's cup of tea but I thought is was both pretty cool and functional. Other comments about the open plan bathroom are a little OTT as while the shower and basin are open, the toilet is behind a closing door.The central location is excellent with a huge variety of bars and restaurants in the area. Speaking of food, the European breakfast was more than adequate albeit with a lesser variety than either English or US breakfast selections.The service was also more helpful than most 5 star establishments I have been to in recent years.At the end of the weekend I could not fault this hotel and I can't remember a hotel where I have had better service, a better room and breakfast for the very reasonable price I paid. It is fantastic value and I would recommend this hotel and now look forward to trying other hotels in the chain.

<Content>Excellent Value, Good location I reserved two rooms at the hotel in August for myself and daughter and friend and daughter. Our room (503) was facing into a central 'well' in the middle of the hotel, so although quite large was also quite dark. Big bonus though was that it was very quiet so we had an excellent night's sleep. Our friends faced out onto the square (405), smaller room though light and lively, but they were disturbed a little by lots of noise overnight (nothing that earplugs won't sort out though). If your rest is important to you, go for one of the inner facing rooms. Hotel is very well appointed for the price range and rooms well equipped (nice ornage smelling toiletries), though being two short people the shower head was fixed way too high for us to maneouvre it. We just took it down and used it as a hose. Sink a little too high too. Big walk in shower was good, mirrored door on the toilet was strange and we kept walking into it! Comfy beds and generally good quality facilities including reasonable mini-bar. Breakfast is in tapas bar right next door. No issues - just walk in and go and get your breakfast. A slip asking for your room / name etc is handed to you to fill in. My daughter loved the eggs and bacon. Bill was all correct and check in and out were very quick. Pretty good quality in all. Good looking boys on reception were a pleasant bonus! Santa Ana square is lively with good pavement cafes and it is close to the art museums and Sevilla metro. Easyjet flight (delayed - a total shambles) got us in very late so we had to get a taxi from the airport. I speak good Spanish so asked for a quote (30 euros). 30 euros it was but driver drove off with the 40 euros proffered despite me asking for change and even telling him we were prepared to tip. He just wanted us out of the cab so he could drive off. Could have been worse and it didn't spoil the trip but don't trust them. I've always used the metro before - only extreme lateness ruled it out this time. Also be aware that since my last visit they have introduced an extra euro charge to get to the airport over and above your metro ticket. You have to buy the supplementary ticket when your journey ends at the airport (do you have to do it going out? Assume so though we only travelled one way). We had extra journeys left on our ten trip tickets but they don't count for the supplement. Would recommend the hotel and look forward to trying another Room Mate on next trip to Madrid.

<Content>Really cool hotel with a fantastic location The Alicia is a very cool, boutique type hotel. We stayed in a standard room, which was small, but perfectly adequate for a short 3 night stay. The hotel is situated on the corner of Plaza Santa Ana, a very lively square with lots of bars and restaurants, which is only a ten minute stroll to the Sol metro for easy access around the city. Rooms are clean and comfortable - only warning I would give is that the shower cubicle is actually in the bedroom (no separate bathroom, only WC), so only use this hotel if you are very familiar and comfortable with your room mate!Breakfast is included in the room price, and is served in the tapas restaurant on the ground floor. Is very good too; usual croissants and pastries, yogurts, toast, fruit and some hot food to get you started for the day.Would recommend taking the Madrid Vision tourist bus round the city to get your bearings - 16 euros/day. Essential to visit both Prado and Reina Sofia art galleries - the latter housing Picasso's Guernica - and the Royal Palace. Would recommend this hotel for its great location and friendly staff.

<Content>A GEM! GREAT location! What a little gem of a hotel. Did not know what to expect when I first checked in as the building is a bit non-descript on the outside. The Plaza Santa Ana is a trendy, 'happening' location. Rooms are on the small side but well appointed furnishings, compact bathroom. One shower wall is glass and opens out into the actual room which may not offer privacy if sharing....interesting design feature. Small staff- very nice, helpful, young. Breakfast included with rate. Outside rooms which look onto the Plaza may be a bit noisy so if you are sensitive, bring earplugs. Although the site notes that it is close to the Seville Metro stop, Anton Martin was just as close and is very convenient. Other amenities include free internet which is convenient. Would definitely stay here again!!!

<Content>A Bit of a Disappointment My teenage daughter and I stayed at this hotel for four nights in early July. Our room was dark due to subdued lighting and a small window, but to be fair I did ask for a quiet room. It was fairly quiet. If I had known what we would get, I would have asked for a room with a large window. The room had a very swampy odour when the air conditioning was turned off. We tried to leave our extra card in the outlet slot so the air conditioning would stay on, but it was taken out by the maid and eventually she took it for good. I had some febreeze so it was bearable. The decor was nice, different and a bit funky. The in-room shower was not a problem at all.Our minibar did not work and when I asked at the desk they offered me ice. I was happy to get it, but a working minibar would have been preferable. The staff were very helpful and always polite. The restaurant they recommended was good. I think it was called Ginger. The area was really nice, away from the crazy busy areas. Overall it was an o.k. experience, but I would probably try somewhere else the next time.

<Content>Junior Suite very sweet The Alicia is a lovely boutique hotel on a lively, clean, upmarket plaza in Madrid. The Santa Ana plaza has many good restaurants and tapas bars on it, and is a great place to people watch.One of the nicest spots to people watch is from the bathtub by the windows in the Junior Suite - it looks right down on the square! The Suite is a good size, esp. for a european hotel. The shower room is seperate from the bedroom/lounge unlike in the standard rooms. The huge windows let in lots of light, and while there is quite a lot of traffic noise in the day it drops off late at night. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the breakfast in the tapas bar was more than adequate unless you are looking for the full english breakfast. Tortilla, scrambled eggs, bacon, fresh fruit, cold meats, pastries and croissants are all available. After a couple of days the wait staff do anticipate your request for tea or cappuchino and will bring it to your table almost as soon as you sit down. We loved our stay at the Alicia and hope that we will be able to return.

<Content>Viva Madrid, Viva Roommate Alicia We had the pleasure of five nights at this property in the middle of the European Football (Soccer) Championships. Despite being exhausted after 3 1/2 weeks of travel, we enjoyed and would recommend the hotel.The location is fabulous, right on the Plaza Santa Ana, the hottest spot in Madrid, it seemed. It is an easy walk to the Metro or the railroad station as well as within walking distance of the major museums (Prado, Reina Sofia and Thyssen). The room was comfortable and fun with floor to ceiling windows and a central (in the middle of the room) shower (though the placement of the shower head was not the best). The furniture was comfortable and the amenities good. The breakfast in the cafe next door was decent though I would have liked individually prepared espresso rather than coffee from a carafe. There was free internet available in the lobby (though you have to stand at the counter to use it). Service in the restaurant in the evening was mixed, but there are other places nearby if you can adjust to the Spanish food and eating times/styles.The service was excellent, provided by some very friendly and well informed young men.I would highly recommend this hotel for a good time in Madrid.

<Content>Trendy, Friendly, well located Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Alicia 1 night in May and really enjoyed our stay. Its a very clean, comfortable hotel with a friendly staff and really well located in the center with all of the major attractions a quick walk. Santa Ana square is a great night spot without being in the super touristy area around Plaza Major, including a couple of tapas restaurants that are smoke free!

<Content>Nice hotel, fantastic location....... This is a good quality hotel for 3* rating in the capital city. Location is excellent, within short walking distance of the city centre, the museums and Atocha train station.The hotel amenities are basic, but the rooms are reasonably clean and fairly spacious for European standards. Just one thing to be aware of, the room we booked had an open bathroom, so the shower cubicle was right in the centre of the room with no proper covering. This might be okay for couples visiting, but with friends, it might be slightly embarassing if not just uncomfortable. This was not clearly stated in the room description on the hotel website.Breakfast is included within the price, but quality is really substandard so hardly worth considering when choosing this hotel.

<Content>Couldn't be better Room Mate Alicia is incredible. The location is perfect with lots of restaurants, markets, bars and shops just steps away, but it was quiet at night and we had no problem sleeping. The nearest metro stop was just 2 blocks away. The room was perfect. Nice view out the window and good sunlight. Very spacious and the shower was indulgent. The staff was very friendly and helpful. A computer is available in the lobby for guests use. Wouldn't change a thing and would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Cool, Hip Place--Very Good Value I found the Hotel Alicia on Trip Advisor so I felt I should give back to the community and write a review.This hotel was a great find. I travelled with my 18-year-old niece and we shared a regular room. The location in the Plaza de Santa Ana was terrific--very lively, great for people watching and taking in the local atmosphere. We made our way around the entire plaza eating and drinking. The plaza is alive with music and locals every day. Great access to museums, the Plaza Mayor, the Rastro, and the Retiro.The hotel was an extremely good value. Our room single room ran 110-130 Euros per day and was clean and hip. The staff was friendly, good-looking, and helpful. They provided us with great tips on what to see and do. The room rate included breakfast which was adequate. I only heard one complaint from my niece--she has long hair and the hair dryer in the room was inadequate. She survived without drying her hair for a couple days.I don't have any pictures to add since the hotel website provides a very accurate photo tour. It was exactly as expected.I plan on booking this hotel chain again in the future.

<Content>Loved the Alicia The Alicia in Madrid was my home for 8 days in May. The hotel was very attractive, immaculate, nicely designed, with some fun, edgy features. Included breakfasts served until 1100. The location couldn't have been better. It is located on a corner of the Santa Ana Plaza, there were many bars and restaurants just outside the door. The art museums, palace, Plazas Mayor and Sol are all within easy walking distance. We never needed to use the Metro. I saved the best for last - the real strength of the Alicia lies with the staff. They are all so outgoing, interested in the guests well being, friendly, helpful; they could not have been nicer. Great problem solvers too. I can't imagine staying anywhere else when I return to Madrid!

<Content>Fantastic Alicia We stayed in an Executive room (403) which had a patio area, table and double sun bed...it was fantastic although weather could have been better.The hotel location is brilliant, convenient for everything and the hotel staff, particularly the reception staff were incredibly helpful.We will certainly be going back......and hoping for warmer sunnier weather!! The hotel could not be better though.

<Content>Brilliant hotel My friend and I spent 2 nights at the Room Mate Alicia, Madrid and would highly recommend it! Lovely, clean room with a really unusual, modern design. All staff were very helpful, and we found it very good value for money. The hotel is in a great location for sight seeing, shopping and eating out. We would definately stay in this hotel again and we are keen to try out the other hotels in the chain! :0)

<Content>Love the Hotel Alicia! What a great hotel. Amazing location. Modern, comfortable accommodations. Nice amentities. Delicious Spanish breakfast. Attentive staff. We couldn't ask for more. We highly recommend getting a junior suite overlooking the Plaza Santa Ana. Forget about turning the television on. When we weren't down there ourselves, we could observe the mesmerizing scene from our comfy corner perch 4 stories above. The hotel is also perfectly situated in the middle of Madrid's city center. An excellent home base to explore the city from. And a welcoming, comfy sanctuary to return to at the end of the day.

<Content>Good for the price and location the hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. the decor is modern- with white bedding- always a good choice for a less expensive hotel because it seems clean and crisp. we had the smallest room in the hotel- it was very small- about 18 inches of room around the bed. great space planning though- as the room and bathroom were functional. we had requested a larger room- facing the outside towards the plaza. so this was my only complaint- that they ignored my request and didnt have an outside/ larger room available.

<Content>A great experience at Alicia! We loved the hotel. The location on the Plaza de Santa Ana was terrific. The junior suite was a fantastic room, with up to date conveniences. We loved the push-button blinds and the free standung bathtub. The staff was great in providing us services when needed. The continental breakfast was just right for us. We're telling everyone that the Hotel Alicia was a pleasant surprise and helped make our visit to Madrid a memorable one.

<Content>A nice hotel at Plazza Santa Ana We spent five nights in the hotel. Our room was modern and comfortable furnished. The location of the hotel is optimal. It' s surrounded by a lot of restaurants and bars. Many places of interest are within walking distance. The staff was friendly and helpful. There are cakes, ham, eggs, cheese, fruits and more on the breakfast buffet.

<Content>Tremendous location We stayed for six nights (May 2008) at the Room Mate Alicia. Very conveniently located to museums, primary tourist attractions, train station, etc. Outstanding central location on Santa Ana square. Price of taxi to most tourist sites was 5 Euros or less. Rooms are new, modern decor, spacious, with all needed conveniences. Stayed in fifth floor room and extremely quiet, even on weekends with the crowds in Santa Ana square. The buffet breakfast (included in the room price) at the Tapasbar restaurant next door was outstanding. The quality and wide variety of food choices was excellent. The Tapasbar restaurant is large with plenty of tables, and there was never a wait for a table even at the peak time for breakfast. The breakfast was available until 11:30 a.m. The front desk staff at the Alicia was very helpful, and there was always at least one staff member available that was fluent in English. An excellent hotel, with an outstanding location that was reasonably priced. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Terrific Hotel Everything about this hotel was wonderful: the location, the very helpful staff, the price. Anyone considering staying here should be advised that though the hotel is on the busy and popular Plaza Santa Anna it is NOT noisy because they used two barriers of double-paned glass when renovating: one on the exterior and another separate set of sliders inside that. The hotel is modern and hip and, frankly, a bit dimly lit for us middle-aged folks in the rooms owing more to the use of trendy lighting than on economizing, but that is a modest quibble. The staff is particular friendly and helpful. Indeed, having stayed at the Room Mate hotel in Granada on the same trip (Migueletes) my wife and I would highly recommend their properties. Breakfast, an ample buffet, is also included, which is no small thing given the value of the dollar.

<Content>Great Location, Awesome Staff Conveniently located, Room Mate Hotel Alicia is 5-minute walk from either Sevilla or Ant贸n Mart铆n Metro Stations, 10-minute walk to Plaza Mayor, and 15-minute walk to Museo del Prado. Our room, on the top floor overlooking Plaza Santa Ana, was bright, clean, and tastefully decorated. Despite we were woken up one night at 3 AM by a group of people chanting and singing outside at the plaza, overall we had a wonderful stay. The buffet breakfast was good and adequate. The staff was friendly and helpful. Special thanks to Antonio and another guy whom we regrettably forgot to ask for his name. Thank you for going the extra mile and all your help!

<Content>Excellent hotel in an excellent location! My wife and I stayed at Room Mate Alicia for 5 nights in mid-April 2008. We were very impressed with the staff, cleanliness, decor, view, and most importantly the location. This hotel is located right on the corner of Plaza Santa Ana.....a fabulous little area for good tapas, vino or cervesas. You just can't find a better location for hoofing it in any direction to all of the major historical museums, galleries, cathedrals or palaces. For the five days we stayed in Madrid, the only taxi rides were from the airport to Alicia and from Alicia to Antoca train station (which could actually be traversed by foot from Alicia if one really wanted to). We had one of the three suites on the first floor (actually second flight up....remember you鈥檙e in Europe!). The suites occupy the entire corner section of the hotel providing the guests a sweeping view of the entire plaza. The rooms are also equipped with electric shutters and vertical blinds (have fun learning/mastering the control switches). By day two I had it all down pat. We highly recommend paying a bit extra and going for one of the suites. One suggestion though ......go for the second or third floor. The noise from the street wasn't all that bad on the first floor, especially at night with the shutters closed, but the first floor suite is located right over the automatic hotel lobby and adjoining restaurant sliding doors that tend to open and close a bit more than most folks would want to hear early in the AMRemember.....Spain is the nightlife capitol of Europe and folks like to head out for the evening late and stay out. My advice is do like the Spaniards and enjoy your vacation the same way. You shouldn't expect to hit the sack by 10PM and not hear a pin drop when you staying in a great city.....with great people.....dining and drinking until the wee AM hours. Take your siestas and head out when they do. Alica is wonderful.....well worth every cent (even with the lousy dollar/Euro exchange rate). Enjoy all the tapas ......enjoy all the wonders of this beautiful city and especially its people.

<Content>not 100% perfect but would return Stayed here twice within 2 weeks, on the way to and returning from Marrakesh. I had asked for an external room on upper floor and this wish was granted - in fact, we were upgraded to a junior suite. This room was absolutely perfect, beautifully designed with everything you could wish for, well maintained and spotlessly clean. Street noise was not a problem due to the double, double glazing. Unfortunately we were wakened early in the morning by internal noise from the cleaners, whose station was nearby. On our return trip we were given a standard external room on the first floor. Some areas of it were in need of some maintenance (e.g. carpet) and table was quite dusty as if the room had not been used for a while. Here, we were not bothered by internal noise. The breakfast is good in the Tapas bar - I quite liked the fact that it was full of locals, even if they do smoke! The fruit salad was lovely and they make you a nice pot of tea if you ask at the bar!

<Content>Great Location and accommodation Really pleased with the central location. Rooms were bright, modern and clean with some thoughtful touches. Breakfast buffet was good, and included in the price. Couldn't fault the hotel, very helpful staff and great value for money. Would stay here again.

<Content>Great Room Great Location We stay over the first weekend in April and really enjoyed the hotel. we had a junior suite with basically floor to ceiling windows overlooking the very busy square. It was very noisy but all windows had 2 sets of double glazing so when closed it was virtually silent. All the facilities were great, huge bath and wet room and excellent value. Breakfast was only ok and the mini bar could have been better stocked but if I were to go back to Madrid I would go back or certainly try another room mate hotel.

<Content>Surprising We chose room with a double be, but got twins. We had the possibility to change for another room, but this one was overheated and near a noisy service lift, so we stayed in the first one. In the good points, the hotel situation is excellent, the room itself is big and attractive, the beds are really comfortable, and the breakfast is good (for a Mediterranean standard, less for a north European standard). In the less good points, the 鈥渂athroom鈥?is special, as it is not really separated from the sleeping room: the washbasin is in the room, the WC are only separated by a sliding door (which doesn鈥檛 fully close鈥? and the shower (no bath) has a transparent door; there is not a lot of privacy here, you better have to be intimate with your travelling companion.

<Content>Great centrally located hotel This is our second stay at this hotel.It is hard to fault the hotel as it is clean, modern and has a great location overlooking a nice square.The staff are friendly and helpful. The only down side would be the lack of a communal area or lounge within the hotel (breakfast is next door in an adjoining bar / cafe).(Also, on this occasion, unlike the last in September, there were building works underway next door. These started early in the morning).Otherwise, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel as it is generally good value for money, has very comfortable beds, nice toiletries and free daily apples in your room!

<Content>Perfect Hotel Me and my girlfriend stayed at the Alicia for three nights in April. After a mistake at the nearby Mario hotel, we were moved to Alicia. At first we were quite put out, but after seeing the room (we were upgraded to a duplex room - with a balcony!) everything was okay! The hotel is in a really good area, 5 minutes walk to the underground, but there's plenty to do around the hotel. Bars, restaurants, shops, sights, all within easy walking distance.The hotel staff were absolutely brilliant. We accidently locked our passports in the hotel safe and on the night of us leaving, the staff spent over an hour helping us to get them out. Meaning we made our flight!We looked at numerous hotels for our break in Madrid and this really was a good one. Clean, roomy, friendly staff and excellent location. i would definitely recommend this hotel for a break in Madrid.DK

<Content>Great location, fantastc value for a boutique hotel A fantastic location for the Prado, and easy walking to museums, gardens and restaurants. Overlooking one of the popular meeting places, and a real hub of activity.The room was very good value for a very well designed, comfortable and stylish retreat from the bustle outside. Fresh fruit and a thorough clean daily.The staff were friendly - young and enthusiastic. Good breakfast in the bar next door.

<Content>Amazing Hotel, Amazing Location, Amazing Weekend The Room Mate Alicia has it all! My girlfriend and I staying in a Junior suite in early April and had an amazing stay. The views of the Plaza St. Anna, living space, and terrific bathroom are definitely worth the extra money. The staff is extremely helpful and helped us with directions to Flamenco and various clubs. The breakfast is next door and, although some people complain about it, it is actually very nice. It is also a great place for some Tapas in the evening as well. We had no problems with noise from the busy plaza and, while there is some noise audible from the hallway it was never a big deal. The location of the hotel is incredible. The Plaza St. Anna has lots of restaurants and a good market and the Puerto del Sol is just a short walk away. The Prado and other museums and the Palacio Real are also within walking distance. There were also fewer tourists here than in other places in Madrid which made our experience that much more authentic.The hotel helped make our weekend in Madrid a truly wonderful experience. I will definitely look to stay with Room Mate again when I return to Spain!

<Content>Great location....a few niggles though We stayed for 3 nights at the Hotel Alicia. The location was very good and you can easily walk to all the main attractions within 10-15 minutes (Plaza Mayor/Palacio Real/Prado).Check in was extremely slow, it was as if the receptionist was trying to hack into a computer mainframe while we waited! We had requested an exterior room and arrived at 13.00 (as we had previously informed the hotel). A room was not available so we were advised to take a walk for an hour. Was eventually given a first floor exterior room - a word of warning...do not stay on the first floor! There was excessive noise from reception and the Plaza at night - there was no door at the top of the staircase from reception to block out any noise hence all noise travelled directly up the stairwell to our room. Luckily we had brought earplugs!The room itself was well appointed and decorated - shower was brilliant! The room was cleaned very well each day.Breakfast in the Tapas bar next door was sufficient if a little poor on the selection front (there was no tea at all and cereals offered were few).We were disappointed on check out that reception attempted to charge us for drinks from the mini bar which we had not touched during our entire stay! Not sure where they got the information from but this put a slight dampener on the overall experience we received.In conclusion this is a good hotel with a great location - we would stay there again but be more specific with our room request (i.e. request a room on a higher floor).

<Content>Glad to be Room Mates with Alicia We had booked 4 nights at the Alicia requesting a quiet, non-smoking room. Little did we realize this would be in an enclosed shoot. since the air was not yet on in the hotel (only heat) we had to have the windows open. This allowed us to hear everyone else's conversations and sneezes. We were not happy.However, you staff was able to move us for our remaining three nights to a wonderful room. this made us very happy. Otherwise we would have left the hotel for the first room was terrible.It would be helpful for American guests if on your website you had a place to indicate the type of bedding desired. As I did not do this and we had 2 beds and wanted one, a double.Your daytime front desk staff were very helpful I even asked them to translate a luncheon menu from a nearby restaurant which they seemingly did happily.All the staff was friendly.

<Content>A modern chain hotel We have just returned from a three night stay at the Room Mate Alicia. The hotel is in an excellent location at the corner of one of the most attractive and lively squares in Madrid - Plaza Santa Ana. Reception staff are extremely friendly and happy to converse in either English, Spanish or a mixture of both! We stayed in an executive room on the fourth floor (403) which included a large private roof terrace. The room was a reasonable size for Madrid, clean and decorated in a modern, simple style with a few quirky touches. The bathroom was beautiful with a very good, powerful shower. When we arrived the air conditioning was broken (as per the earlier review) but it was fixed that day. The bed itself and the quality of the linen/towels, toiletries and small travel hairdryer are average and of three star quality. The mini bar is reasonably priced and the room we stayed in included a safe, seating area and plenty of wardrobe space. On the downside, we were woken by internal noise from other rooms, including next door's bathroom and the cleaners accessing a supplies cupboard in the corridor. The internal soundproofing in the hotel is poor and your experience will depend on the activities of others in nearby rooms. External windows and doors are well sound proofed though. The breakfast is served downstairs in the hotel Tapas Bar. The buffet breakfast is above average with good quality pastries, fruit, yogurts, cereal, cold meats and cheeses, pan con tomate etc but the staff are slow to provide coffee and replenish buffet items. This is a modern chain hotel. It does feel formulaic and you are paying above average for a quirky apple by your bed and stylish bathroom fittings but chains such as this are fun to stay in and are setting new standards. Overall, Hotel Alicia is a good choice for the fantastic location and friendly reception staff alone.

<Content>Perfect location and great hotal The hotel was situated in a lovely square which was really lively in the evenings. Had noted previous guest comments about noise being a problem but did not find this to be the case even though our room looked out directly overe the square - the double glazing kept all the noise out. Stayed here with 2 other couples and all our rooms were great - loved the layout - very clean, uncluttered and trendy and liked the unusual bathroom layout - the apples were very tasty too!Breakfast good though staff a little slow to clear tables, bring coffee etc. Probably not their fault really as not many of them and quite busy when we were there.Desk staff very helpful - free internet access at the main desk was useful for on-line check in prior to returning home.Loved Madrid. Ate in Ginger which was a short walk from the hotel - would definatele recommend if you can get in - don't take bookings but very efficient door staff who will take a number and call you as soon as table becomes available - excellent food, slick service - Gordon Ramsey would be impressed!

<Content>Nice hotel, but slightly over-rated We stayed here Fri and Sat night. We had 2 double rooms and 2 single rooms ( but still double beds).One of the rooms was an OK size, the singles were very small.The location of the hotel is perfect, and is worth 5 stars. I don't think the rooms are. Although funky decor, it didn't sleep very well. The rooms were terribly hot and opening all windows didn't help at all. I asked why the AC was not working, and the answer was they would turn the AC on in the next few weeks. No good for me.We had an interior room, so not a lot of noise from the streets, but a lot of noise from neighboring rooms and the hallway.Shower couldn't supply water at a constant temperature , but pressure was very good. Toilet door (sliding) didn't close all the way. Beds were nice and hard. Breakfast was as good as a Spanish hotel breakfast will ever get. Mini bar was reasonably priced.Would I come back ? Possibly, but only if the AC is guaranteed to be working.. as I really didn't sleep well due to the heat in the room ( and it was only 20 degrees outside), and neither did my friends. That is the reason I give it 3 stars only.

<Content>Just as great as everybody says! My wife and I stayed for two nights and could not have had a better time. The hotel has an amazing location on the corner of Plaza Santa Ana and yet the rooms are fantastically quiet even on a bustling evening. The staff were friendly, helpful and efficient and the one very minor issue that we had with the room (we couldn't get the window to close properly) was dealt with immediately. The rooms themselves are spacious, stylish and immaculately clean. This hotel really is as good as the other reviews suggested!!!

<Content>Excellent location Stayed at Mate Alicia for 3 days in March 2008, starting on Good Friday. The location was excellent. We had two rooms, one with a window view of Plaza Santa Ana and the other an interior room. The view was nice during the day but it was loud, particularly because of the holiday and the procesiones occurring on the street below due to Holy Week. The interior room was very quiet. Initially we had two window rooms, but asked for a change because one of the rooms, while billed as non-smoking, had clearly been used most recently by smokers and reeked of smoke. The staff was quick to accomodate our request to change rooms and we found we preferred the interior room for its quiet. Location could not be better.

<Content>Great location, had problem with security Hotel is in the most central location in Madrid for tourists.Approximately half way from Museums and Royal Madrid attractions. Also halfway between shopping district and the older quarter. Very well kept and clean.Rooms are very funky and well appointed. Hotel can be a little noisy at times. Only problem we had was with security in the hotel's breakfast room. My daughters purse was snatched from the breakfast room by outsiders who were able to enter the hotel dining room despite a very non effective security man who stood outside the entrance to the breakfast room. Needless to say the experience somewhat soured our trip to Madrid.

<Content>Best hotel of our trip We've been on the road a month, and the Room Mate Alicia was the best hotel we've been in. Fantastic location, gorgeous junior suite, with great amenities and wonderful view. The amount of space was fantastic. Breakfast was great, although the staff was quite slow in replenishing things.

<Content>Madrid's Best Hotel! We have just returned on 14th march from a 2 night stay in Hotel Room Mate Alicia and we absolutely loved it! The hotel itself is really cool and trendy, with spacious and equally as cool rooms. The staff behind reception are knowledgeable and helpful and can't do enough for you. Breakfast in the tapas bar next door is fantastic with a wide range of breakfast food and drink. The evening meals here are also highly recommended. The hotel is situated on the corner of Plaza Santa Ana, a beautiful bustling square. There are many trendy cocktail bars nearby and a gorgeous restaurant called 'Ginger,' located on the street which runs off the top of Plaza Santa Ana. The food here is excellent and really reasonably priced. The hotel is central to shopping and many of the attractions in Madrid. I can't recommend this hotel enough....stay here and you most definitely won't be disappointed!

<Content>Perfect for a weekend away We arrived early on a friday morning, not expecting to be able to check in, as check in started at 2pm, but instead were upgraded from a normal room to a junior suite! The room was fantasic - amazing views over the square, very clean, high ceilings, spacious - HUGE bed and very funky bathroom and stand alone bath. we also had a curved sofa and flat screen TV, and black out blinds that we were able to control with a click of a button! all in all a really great room. also not very noisy at all - weren't really aware of anyone else in theohotel at all!Location was perfect for exploring the city - within walking distance of everything you'd want to see, and right in the middle of the nightlife etc. we did a bus tour but hardly used the metro because it was just more pleasant to walk everywhere.Breakfast downstairs in the funky tapas bar was perfect - lots of breads, croissant, doughnuts, cereals, muffins, spanish omelette, eggs, bacon, tomatoes, fresh fruit and juices and best of all was available to 12, so not rushing down early after a night out till 5am!!would recomend this hotel to anyone going to madrid for a long weekend (or longer), great value for money and lovely staff too.

<Content>This hotel overbooks. Arrived at 7 pm or so and was told that they had no room for me . This in spite of a written confirmation directly from the hotel and a confirmatory email from them mere days prior. Very apologetic, they put me up for one night at the Hotel Soho Vincent on c/Prado 2 blocks away. While the Soho was luxuriously appointed and I was given a suite there, I didn't care for its design (weird, dark and confusing). I was told I would not be charged for my stay and I assumed that meant my stay at Alicia the following night would also be on the house. Alicia assured me I would be given their best room the following night. Indeed Alicia's penthouse suite was magnificent; a 2 level beauty with its own private terrace and pool overlooking Plaza S. Ana. At checkout I was given a bill for EUR 230 and was a bit surprised. At the end of the day, I stayed 2 nights in 2 separate suites for the price I'd confirmed for staying 2 nights in their standard room, with the inconvenience of having to switch hotels. A fair deal or not? I don't know. Breakfast included, extensive buffet, but could we please not have it in a smoky tapas bar?

<Content>Perfect location,trendy hotel We stayed her with friends [i booked the hotel] at the end of Feb.Location is perfect-so easy to walk to places.The rooms are immaculate if a little unusual with the decor and the layout of the shower and toilet but not a problem. Our room looked out to a brick wall and was a little on the dark side but our friends room had a massive window and looked out on the street which meant it was nice and light [ask for a room with a big window]A good breakfast- loads to choose from served in the tapas barWould def stay there again

<Content>Great hotel. Just returned from 3 night stay at the room mate Alicia,we booked the hotel through Go 2 Spain payed just over 拢70per night inc breakfast what a result.The hotel its staff and its location were superb.We walked our socks off for 3 days and 3 nights and will be coming back for more very soon.Please dont be put off by comments about breakfast being in a bar next door it is in same building and was excellent,also good for lunch.We also would recomend Ginger if you can get in,but make sure you eat upstairs (no smoking).Also ate at el cathedral (straight out of hotel door 200yds to hotel asturias and turn left).Overall fantastic break in a fantastic place,if your lucky enough to stay at the weekend and its sunny spend the day in Reitro park it will cost you nothing and you will enjoy.

<Content>Fantastic location! We have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Alicia.Didn't experience any of the previous reviewer's problems.The location is just ideal,easy walking distance to the 3 main museums and to the palace.We enjoyed eating at Ginger and Olsen-two nearby restaurants,and if we had had time would have tried more as recommended by the staff.Would definately recommend this hotel!

<Content>Good central location Perfectly adequate room for our tourist needs in exploring the city. Cracking central location on the Santa Ana square....you really don't need to go anywhere else!.... but you should!Rooms were as we expected, basic and noisy at night (although we did complain at one point regarding an incredibly selfish pig0headed chap who had his window open til 4am with rave music blasting out; reception soon controlled it after our complaint!The one thing we do remember is that even though it was feb and we needed coats and scarfs of a day, it was stiflingly hot at night and the air con was rubbish!I get the impression that you need to haggle with the hotel staff prior to your visit to get the best room with a decent non-walled- view and decent aircon, but hey, we weren't there to sit in our room, it was just for the bed!Liked the apple instead of a choccy!You can walk to pretty much most tourist attractions from the hotel and a visit to the beautiful Park Retiro is a must on Saturday mornings......a live band serenaded (with lively jazz music) all of the local families and children....just ace!A good base for exploring, but did get the impression it attracts a rather strange clientele....... no doubt I'll probably be slated for that comment but it is my opinion.I'd probably not use it again although would recommend it for younger party-animal twenty-somethings.

<Content>Great Location We stayed in the Room Mate Alicia at the start of February. We thought that the hotel is in a great location so we walked to most places and the rooms were nice although the first room we had was a bit noisy. We understood that there would be a dvd player in the room (I think from the website) so we were pretty disappointed that there wasn't and I don't think our air conditioning unit was working properly - it was very hot in Feb so wouldn't like to stay there in summer. We thought that the breakfast selection was quite good, but the service was really quite disappointing. After begging (in our best Spanish) for tea for our table the waitress came with one cup. The other days we didn't even ask.

<Content>Excellent Hotel - Fantastic location We stayed at this hotel over a weekend at the beginning of February and couldn't fault it. The location is superb, in the dead centre of the main sights of Madrid. The reception staff were all very helpful and could speak English very well. I had read reviews of people getting rooms with views of a wall so emailed the hotel directly in advance and requested a room wih a nice view - we got a room on the top floor over-looking the plaza.It can be a little noisy at night, but this should be expected from a hotel in the middle of things. The room were very clean and modern, breakfast was fantasic in a little tapas bar joined onto the hotel. For a tapas bar in the evening I would recommend the one just over the road to the right hand side from the entrance to the hotel.All in all, a fantastic hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel We were really happy staying in this Hotel. It is in a great location in the centre of Madrid. You can walk to most of the sights and museums/art galleries.Great little Bars and Restaurants around Santa Ana.The Hotel itself is lovely. We stayed in a Junior Suite and would highly recommend it. Had a great view out over the Plaza and the room itself was very funky.Breakfast was average but we didnt really mind. Would have no hesitation recommending this hotel to anyone wanting to be right in the Heart of a cool city like Marid!!!Ps, do try and take in a Flamenco show while you're there!!

<Content>Good hotel, except breakfast Good hotel, and the staff spoke good english. The room was modern and clean, although the view from the room was of a brick wall!!!The breakfast was of a good standard, however the waiting staff were very slow to clean up after guests and to re-fill the buffet selection. That was why we cant rate the hotel to Excellent.

<Content>Great little hotel Great ,tidy, clean hotel. We stayed here for two nights and couldn't have been closer to the centre of Madrid. Just a short walk from Sol metro station ideal for lots of bars and nice restaurants. Right!!!! back to the hotel.A warm welcome was given by all the staff who spoke really good english. Warm and curteous the staf fwere quick to book us in and present the key for the room. The room was modern and clean with a safe to keep valuables, although the view from the room was of a brick wall!!!The breakfast was of a good standard, however the waiting staff were very slow to clean up after guests and to re-fill the buffet selection.The down side to the breakfast restaurant (and to the majority of eateries in Madrid!!) is that smoking was permited.Madrid loves to smoke - none smokers you have been warned!!!!

<Content>Great, bright hotel in excellent location This was a great hotel - very bright, modern, hip and clean. At about $175 per night we felt that we got good value in an excellent location. We had a very nice interior room (by request) which was quiet but a bit hot until we opened the window. There was an extensive and very good breakfast at the associated Tapas Bar - the best eggs and ham we had in Spain.We walked to almost everything except the America Museum, and the local metro stops provided easy and convenient access to that museum and from the airport. If you are a walker and traveling in low season, it is probably not worth getting either the Madrid Card or the Metro 3-day Card. We enjoyed walking around the city and could not fit enough museums into our schedule to make the Madrid Card worthwhile. However, since it was winter we did not have long waits to buy tickets at the various museums - our only wait was 30 minutes at the Prado.If you enjoy comic or high opera, do plan to go to a performance at the near-by Teatro de la Zarzuela - great, high-quality performance!

<Content>Maybe your Room Mate but definately not our Room Mate! We arrived at this hotel after looking at the reviews on Tripadvisor and seeing that it was number 1 on the travellers ratings, we had high expectations and when we got there were greatly disappointed, travelling with a 3 month baby the first problem encountered was trying to fit in the lift with the buggy which was just big enough if you are fortunate to be on the slender size! Good luck if you are not! This was the first thing to put me in a bad mood and feeling claustraphobic. Definately not recommended for anyone with a wheelchair. Once in the room the look is very nice and indeed modern however the layout of the corner rooms not very practical at all .. the chair to sit at the desk with a lap top is in the way for the other person to watch any television as your view is immediatley obstructed, the smell coming from the drains and toilet was so bad that we asked to change room, afterwards to discover the smell was the same 2 floors down in a different room, the air conditioning in both rooms did not work and was very warm and stuffy, the only solution was to open the window which could only be done if the blind was up which meant that other guests could see in and so taking a shower was a no no as the shower is in the bedroom with a glass door so forget about privacy.The fridge did not work with all drinks inside warm.Breakfast was the only plus point in the Tapas bar next door and included in the price of a very expensive 117 Euros for 1 night.We had spent 2 weeks travelling around Spain in major cities, the previous hotels were half the price and higher star ratings this was the last night of our trip we were looking forward to staying there after tripadvisor rated it number 1 out of 392 hotels in Madrid we were greatly disappointed and did not feel like we were staying in any of our Mates rooms!

<Content>BEST HOTEL in Madrid We arrived on a Wednesday and stayed through Friday. I read the other comments on TripAdvisor and they are very accurate. The check-in staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We also loved the recommendations they gave us for dinner. The breakfast in the mornings was excellent too. We could not ask for more. I am not sure why this hotel is rated a 3 star------it seems more like a 4 star. We will definietly stay at this hotel again. I would suggest a Junior Suite, since it was very comfortable and spacious. Our room was on the 1st floor, facing the street (#103) and we could not hear any outside noise. The room was soundproof. We love this hotel and it made our trip to Madrid a wonderful experience since it was close to everything. We had a metro pass for the trains  buses, but it was not needed. We were able to walk everywhere. Highly recommnended.

<Content>Loved Room Mate Alicia, Madrid We booked this hotel for 3 nights, 6 - 9 January 2008, having never visited Madrid before. The hotel was stylish, very comfortable and extremely central. It is on the corner of Plaza Ana within walking distance of many tourist destinations e.g. The Prada was 10 minutes away. It was also near to public transport routes and the concierge can order a taxi easily if required.Our room was very clean and warm. Occasionally it seemed a little noisy but this was because our room was above the tapas bar which also serves breakfast. (We heard furniture being moved around). Breakfasts were substantial and good.The staff without exception were friendly and helpful and spoke good English.The hotel is surrounded by tapas bars and restaurants so one is almost spoilt for choice of where to eat.

<Content>Great location, good value My husband and I enjoyed staying here for New Year. Great location, close to Sol, in central Madrid. The room was very clean, reasonably sized (though not huge) and had a pleasant outlook over the square. (Ask for an exterior room when booking). Breakfast served in the tapas restaurant next door and offered a good choice.The hotel is situated on one of the main party plazas in Madrid but the two layers of double glazing to the windows kept out the majority of noise. Booked online at roommate website and got an early bird rate which was 50 euros per night cheaper than standard rate. One word of warning, when we turned up, two couples were being taxied off to an alternative roommate hotel (Oscar) as Alicia had overbooked - may just have been because New Year is so busy but they may do this regularly?

<Content>A friendly and beautiful hotel to stay.. This is just a lovely hotel - it is in a great location, right behind Sol and close by to Plaza Mayor. The staff could not have been more helpful and were always happy to advise or help on any aspect of our trip. I would highly recommend this stylish, plush, modern and friendly hotel.

<Content>PWL Nice design, pleasant rooms (I especially liked the black slate floor and shower), friendly staff.Practrical and useful: vertically sliding blackcurtain and horizontally sliding blinds at the touch of a button.Original touch: an apple a day... on your bedside table.Lively neighbourhood, especially in the evenings, but not the most stylish barrio in Madrid.Minus: having your breakfast next door, although included in the rate and of good quality, doesn't quite feel the same... a question of privacy for both hotel guests and regular customers of the restaurant.

<Content>Unbeatable Location and Great Value at the Room Mate Alicia! We stayed at the Room Mate Alicia in Madrid from 12/25 through 12/27. The hotel is in an unbeatable location. We were able to walk everywhere (Plaza Mayor, Palacio Real, Museums, shopping, etc.). There are some very good tapas restaurants within a very short walk of the hotel. We booked an executive room directly through the Room Mate Hotel website. The room was of decent size, furnished in IKEA style with a double bed, small glass table, and 2 chairs. Sliding glass doors opened to the nicest surprise, a terrace, almost larger than the room itself. The terrace overlooked Santa Ana Plaza. It had a vinyl double chaise, teak loveseat and chair and table. There was also an outdoor shower, which we did not try or use given we were there in December! The shower was nice size with plenty of water pressure and hot water. The WC itself was pretty tiny, but serviceable. There was a nice large sink with mirror. Check in was a breeze. We tried when possible to speak in Spanish, but the staff all speak good English and were extremely friendly and helpful. The elevator up to the rooms were quite tiny, but were quick.The breakfast buffet was excellent. Scrambled eggs and a breakfast meat (which varied). Tortillas Espanol (yummy omelet with eggs and potatoes and some with peppers), assorted breads/rolls, cheese, ham/sausages, juice, and coffee/tea rounded out the offerings. I would definately stay at this hotel again. I took photos of the room specifically to post here, but unfortunately we were robbed in Barcelona and among the things the theives made away with was our camera. :(

<Content>fantastic and friendly Like most reviewers here - excluding the most recent - I loved the Hotel Alicia and thought it excellent value for money. The desk staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and the hotel is located on a plaza in Huertas that is centrally located for the art museum district and provides easy access to the cafes and bars of Chueca and Lavapies.The hotel design is funky and the room was a good size. Although some people might worry about the shower being in the room itself (I didn't and it is more private than it might seem), the decor is great. The large windows also gave an excellent view of the plaza and nearby streets. I would definitely stay there again (especially on the early booking rate).

<Content>Beware The problems with this little hotel began even before we arrived. We had booked directly with the hotel as far back as June, 2007. The reservation misspelled our names and erred on our genders. Several emails later, the problem had not been corrected. When we requested a confirmation that the room be non smoking, the email we received stated We've written down your request. When we telephoned the hotel about this, Jorge at the front desk told us he was busy and that we should send an email. We telephoned the following day, and received the same response. We sent another email, again requesting a non smoking room and the response we received was The specifications requested have been bearing in mind. Upon arrival at the hotel (November 27, 2007), we discovered that we had a smoking room. When we insisted on a non smoking room, we were told that there would be one availble in 6-7 hours. The receptionist (a young Malasian man) suggested that we go for a walk, and he said he'd look after our luggage. I began taking some things out (camera etc.) for our walk. Because we did not yet have a room, I told the receptionist that we would leave our money and valuables in the hotel safe. He said that there is no safe at reception, only in the rooms. While this discussion was going on (non smoking room, hotel safe), my camera disappeard. Both the receptionist and the security man at the door insisted that nobody but us had been in the area, and that perhaps I was wrong, etc. Yet the camera was definitely gone. The receptionsit then remembered that they have a surveillance camera, and when he played back the tape, sure enough, someone had entered the hotel (Where was the security man?) and taken my camera. Another receptionist, a young lady, told me that just just recently, there had been two incidents of laptops being stollen from the reception area. The hotel now has a stack of police complaint forms to fill out. She said I could fill one out and take it to the police, but that it would not help at all. Later that day, we finally got our non smoking room. Although this is a new hotel, there already is much wear and tear. Rug and upholstery stains glore, nicked walls, you get the picture. We had a corner room, and all the hotel's exterior walls are made of glass; the window shades which you open with a switch were not working- along one of the glass walls, the shades were wide open for our entire stay, while on the other wall, they were shut. The glass door to the shower, and the sliding door to the toilet area(which does not completely close) offer no privacy.The reception staff are young, friendly, but have no information. You would expect them to have the answers to simple questions such as local gyms and internet cafes. In summary, if you stay at this hotel, leave your laptop and camera at home, don't expect any help from the receptionists, and plan on being exhibited to your travel companion and to all of Madrid.

<Content>fantastic hotel Fnatastic hotel - central location fantastic for sightseeing 10 - 15 minutes walk from all of the major sites and right in the middle of the Heurtas area, great for all the tapas bars. Hotel staff very friendly and very helpful. If you go at xmas time be sure to take the open top bus for 1 euro to see the lights well worth it.

<Content>overcharged at check out! The hotel room was fine, rather small but ok. What I was very unhappy about was that I booked my stay online and got the early booking rate. Of course at check out, they upped my rate even after I reminded them and they assured that I was getting the the lower rate but charged my credit card more. I traveled throughout Europe and this was the only hotel that charged me a higher rate. I would probably not return.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location The hotel was very clean and modern. The junior suite had huge windows, a very modern bathroom and extra seating. The employees at the front desk spoke English and were very helpful, including making dinner reservations and securing taxi cabs. The location was great, very near the Plaza del Sol and on a small plaza with excellent restaurants and gelato shops. We could, and did, walk everywhere from the hotel.

<Content>Loved the room We just came back from Madrid (14th Dec) we booked this hotel for just one night, and we were really surprised when they gave us a duplex room. Woww really wonderful room split over two levels, also had a large terrace and a mini pool. Only neg. comment was the sandblasting work from the neighbouring building Calle de Principe (not sure how long the renovation will last) Very easy to get to from the airport-metro, take line 8 to Nuevos Ministerios then line 10 to Tribunal finally line 1 to Anton Martin there are 2 Anton Martin exits, so just walk straight on, climb the steps, cross right over the road, carry on walking right and you will come to the square. The hotel is accessible to all the museums. Madrid is pretty cold during the day, so wrap up! Room Mate Hotels website: [--]

<Content>Look No Further A group of six of us had deceided to avail of cheap flights to Madrid so it was left to me to organise accommodation. I checked out a number of websites and as usual Trip Advisor came up trumps.The location is fantastic, Plaza de Santa Ana is buzzing and everywhere is easily accessible on foot. There are numerous bars, clubs, restaurants wihin 2-3 streets range. Particularly good are Viva Madrid, Naturbier both nearby.The hotel is very modern but not too funky and we paid the bit extra for a junior suite which has a bath overlooking the square (for exhibitionists). If bothered about noise get a room on the 3rd floor. The service was impeccable not surly as some Madrileno waiters or barman can be and the bar adjoining is a great place to start the night from. Buffet breakfast was included and was more than enough to keep you going until a late tapas lunch. Take your normal eating times and add 2-3 hours. If you book this hotel you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Great hotel in a great location We booked this hotel based on the reviews on this site. They are all dead on! This is a great hotel at a great value. The location on Plaza Santa Ana is fabulous - good tapas bars during the day and a great night life scene in the evening. For tourists, it is walking distance to the three big museums, the palace, and close to Plaza Mayor. We were in Madrid for four days and felt that by staying in this central location, it made our trip even more enjoyable. The hotel staff is very friendly and great with directions and restaurant recommendations. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>It is all true Everything you have read in the reviews prior in correct. Great location, clean, modern, and very good value. I took an Executive room, but it was overkill as the balcony while larger than the room itself and very nice was useless in the cold weather. But for the warmer months, take it! I took the Metro from the airport and this was much easier than I expected, greeted by a Starbucks as you exit Sevilla station, not to mention only 4 Euro's vs the taxi of 40 Euro. Do remember your terminal on the way back! However, a quiet night's sleep is not at this hotel as outside is like Manhattan at night, loud voices, trash trucks, etc. all night and I was there on a Sunday night. Also there is only one person at the desk, and while very friendly and helpful, they get at times overwhelmed. I travel a lot, usually 4-5 star, and I highly recommend this place, just remember it will be noisy outside.

<Content>Had a great time at the Alicia November 2007Review A Trip Advisor member Cheltenham UKThe Alicia is in an excellent position right in the heart of the Huertas district of Madrid, with a wide variety of bars, clubs and restaurants. It overlooks a pretty plaza. We stayed there for 4 nights in November, and had lovely sunny weather though a little chilly. We reached the hotel via the Metro system as described by another trip advisor contributor. It took about an hour. We bought a five day metro travel pass at the airport metro station, and it would have been excellent value if we had used it more! But we didn't need to as all the main attractions are within easy walking distance of the hotel - the Prado and the other art galleries are about 10 mins walk, and the Plaza Major is about 5 mins. We ate in some excellent restaurants just round the corner from the hotel - Casa Alberto was very good and also La Finca de Susana. Excellent live jazz at the nearby Cafe Central. The hotel receptionist was very helpful in providing names of local restaurants. We had been warned that the area can be noisy at night so we asked for an interior room, which meant a good nights sleep, though the room was a little warm. The hotel is spotlessly clean, with stylish furnishings, and an excellent breakfast provided by the restaurant next door to the hotel. We loved Madrid and will definitely return to the same hotel on our next visit.

<Content>Good Hotel; Great Location We were very happy with our four night stay at Alicia. The location on Plaza Santa Ana couldn't be better. One can walk to most of the big attractions and there are plenty of good bars, shops and restaurants close by. Our first floor standard room was comfortable, although we did little more than sleep there. The staff was very helpful. My wife loved the free breakfast, but I would have liked a better cereal choice and less cigarette smoke.

<Content>Fab 3* hotel in excellent location good value We were recommended this hotel by friends and it was just perfect. We stayed in a double room which was spacious with a nice comfortable bed. Staff are very freindly and helpful but what really sells this hotel is the location right in the heart of plaza santa Ana and is centrally located for all the best places to visit. Hotel is modern and trendy and sylish. The Plaza is quite busy and noisey maybe ask for a room not overlooking the square although we didn't mind as we prefered the view. We only paid 拢74 for the room inc breakfast per night booked through [--]. We would def recommend this hotel for location and good value for money.

<Content>Good Location  Hotel has a contempory style, with small but well formed/equipped room. One tip - ask for a room with an outside view, as some rooms seem to be on the inside of the hotel. Very good location, with a pleasant Plaza right outside the front door for drinks  food. 90% of ALL menus are in Spanish, so be prepared!  quite a few spanish are not the most helpful.The breakfast in the Hotel is very nice with a really good selection.I would recommend a open top bus tour on arrival to get your barings  I used the metro all the time, really easy  cheap once you have yr line map.When you come out of the Hotel take the street to the right and find the tourist office and choose what your into seeing. Its also nice around this area, beside the Botianical Gardens.Enjoyed my stay @ this Hotel and would give it 7/10.Georgina (Swords,Dublin)

<Content>Great Small Hotel My wife and I stayed 4 nights at the Alicia toward the end of October. We chose a Jr. Suite which was perfectly located overlooking Plaza Santa Ana. The room was modern and tasteful with lots of floor to ceiling windows. The shades and blinds were motorized which was novel but difficult to figure out. The shower was large and the tub stood alone like a well placed piece of art. The king size bed was very comfortable and the room was plenty spacious for the two of us. We travelled with family who stayed in a standard room. This room was smaller without a tub but very tastefully appointed. The hotel offers no additional amenities except an adjacent restaurant which I am not sure if it is part of the hotel. Breakfast was included with the room. The front desk was helpful enough but there is no concierge. The real draw for us was the location. Having been to Madrid last summer we loved Plaza Santa Ana. It is in walking distance to the Prado, Retiro Park, Plaza Mayor, shopping and (only in Spain) the Ham Museum. Perfect location for us. Normally, we like a hotel with more going on but in this case you only had to walk outside your door. The room had two sets of windows (inside and out) so even though there was plenty going on outside it was relatively quiet inside. We stayed at the Westin Palace last year but prefer the location and furnishings of the Room Mate Alicia. Chose this hotel from Trip Advisor reviews.

<Content>Location, location, location This is just a very quick review - I take from this site so think if is only fair to give back something, even if it is only very brief.On the basis of the reviews on this site we booked the Alicia and were not disappointed in the least. I'm a fussy devil, and where possible do like to stay in 4* hotels, but I could not find fault with this hotel other than there was no tea-making facilities in the room. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Very modern hotel, great location The Room Mate Alicia is very modern, very comfortable, and in a terrific location in the old part of Madrid. It's on the lively Plaza Santa Ana, very near the Plaza Mayor, and within easy walking of the major museums, the Royal Palace and Cathedral. We had a lovely double room, very comfortable, with an ultra-modern bath. We also booked a single room for our son, which, while only 10 euros less than our double, was quite tiny (but certainly adequate). Our room rate included a nice breakfast buffet, served in the Tapas Bar adjoining the hotel. We would absolutely stay there again.

<Content>Great hotel, best location in Madrid and friendly staff We went to Madrid for a long weekend to celebrate my 27th Birthday. I read the reviews on Room Mate Alicia on the Trip Advisor and decided I wanted to stay at the hotel. I couldn't find any availability but eventually managed to book a room through Travel Republic. The room was a basic double interior (which means the windows faced the inside of the hotel, not the outside) which was fine, clean but basic, which was all we wanted. The location on the other hand was brilliant! On a lovely buzzing plaza Santa Ana, walking distance to the beautiful Plaza Mayor, the Royal Palace, the Prado art galleries, the Retiro park...everywhere. There are lots of tapas restaurant in the Santa Ana square so you never have to visit the same place twice. Some great bars in the area, particularly the Penthouse Bar which is very swanky and looks over the square. The hotel staff were extremely helpful, spoke really good English and although they seemed to be worked off their feet (there was only one person at reception at any one time) they helped book us restaurants, gave us maps and directions to everywhere. The hotel rooms also have a very good guide of Madrid with maps and places to visit, eat etc. Having recently been on honeymoon, we were really spoilt when it came to accommodation!! However both of us agreed if and when we do go back to Madrid we would definitely stay at the Alicia.

<Content>Great hotel A friendly hotel in a great position.Our room was quite small but had everything we needed (except for tea/coffee making facilities). We faced away from the square and so it was very quiet.The breakfast was good and the staff very helpful.Everything is within easy reach of the hotel and there are fantastic tapas bars and restaurants to choose from close by.We loved it.

<Content>Quiet and Comfortable Refuge but Close to the Action We arrived early morning after our flight from Seattle to Madrid and found our Executive room available for us immediately. The room was European small but very nicely appointed with a large and very comfortable queen bed. The outside private terrace made the room much nicer and larger with a peek-a-boo view of the Santa Anna Plaza and an outside shower that I used several times after a long hot day of sightseeing. The plaza could get a little noisy in the evening if you wanted to go to bed early - I used the ear plugs they give you on the plane and slept like a baby.We really enjoyed the plaza and the many restaraunts in the area. The hotel is in easy walking distance to the major sights from the Prado in one direction to the Palacio Real in the other.The breakfast was very nice including hot items in addition to the typical continental fare. The one recommendation I would have is that they provide a house computer for use by guests (they do have wireless if you are carrying your own laptop).

<Content>Visit Madrid. Wanted to stay in the Santa Ana area,as on last visit to Madrid spent some time around there. Room Mate Alicia is situated in the corner of the square. The exterior and reception are chic and modern but we felt the room we had was a little uninspireing (from photos same room as MMartins oct 2006) and on arrival bedside tables had sticky cup marks from previous guests. The room was quiet , recepion staff efficient, and enjoyed breakfast. What we both said though is that we needed to remember this hotel is only a 3* and represents good value for money . Madrid is a wonderful city with so much to do and see, this was our 4th visit to Madrid and would recommend it to anyone. Would also like to thank the experts on the madrid forum as their advise is really useful, we tried one of their suggestions for an evening meal at 'La puebla' only one street away from this hotel, it is not a resturant I would have chosen on looks, but the food was fantastic- jamon, baby squid  hake.

<Content>Fantastic hotel, great location Fab chic hotel on the corner of plaza santa Ana, an ideal location for seeing everything on foot. The Plaza is bustling at night with lots of great eatieries. The hotel itself is a breath of fresh air, minimalistic decor, hip, clean and friendly staff. Our room was just what we were looking for, trendy decor, big comfy bed  quiet (we booked an internal room, so no views onto plaza but quiet at night when all the partying was going on). Complimentary breakfast was really good, served in tapas bar next door, help yourself to cooked food  plenty of sweet pastries.... delicious. Madrid itself wonderful, loads to see  do  small enough to walk everywhere. Would definitely recommend this city and hotel, word of warning though, if you don't speak spanish - take a phrasebook everywhere!

<Content>Great location and staff We just returned from a Spain/Portugal trip and enjoyed our stay at the Room Mate Alicia hotel. The decor and style is hip and modern. The staff was very helpful with basic information/directions and spoke both English and Spanish. When we couldn't check into the room until 2pm (and it was only 9am), they directed us to a local tour bus and breakfast options. The room was clean and comfortable and extremely quiet, which was amazing for its location right on the Plaza Santa Ana. Walkable to main attractions. Breakfast was just ok, very basic, European style cold breakfast, was included in hotel price for us but we had MUCH better at other hotels we stayed at later on in the trip. Just be prepared for the funky shower with a glass door that opens right into the room, with strategically placed black opaque stripes. It might be a bit uncomfortable for those traveling with friends/family vs a partner/spouse!We would definitely consider staying here again.

<Content>Great Hotel, Perfect Location Hotel Room Mate Alicia was a true pleasure and one of our favorite hotels for the entire trip. The room was stylish, clean, comfortable and amazingly well-insulated from the noise of the bustling Plaza Santa Ana outside. The location was ideal- on the edge of the best square for nightlife in Madrid and centrally located within walking distance of all the best sites. My only complaints are: 1) A couple of times we could smell the cigarette smoke of a guest smoking in another room. This must be related to the ventilation system and should either be fixed or the hotel should eliminate smoking from the facility 100%. 2) The breakfast the hotel offered for an additional cost in the adjacent restaurant was not very good, and the service was abhorrent: The two women working there were indifferent to the needs and requests of the guests. Many of the tables remained dirty and uncleared, or were missing dishes and utensils. Also, items on the buffet were constantly out and took a very long time to replace. I recommend spending your breakfast money at one of the cafes on Plaza Santa for a better experience and better food.

<Content>Great place, great experience This is a prime location for a hotel, on one corner of the Plaza Santa Ana (theatre and nightlife district) with easy access to walk to all the prime tourist spots in Madrid. Going down the Prado street you can walk to the Barrio de las Letras, various art musems (including the Prado, the Reina Sofia, etc), the botanical gardens, and El Retiro park. Going the other direction you are steps away from the Plaza Mayor, Plaza del Sol, the Palacio Nacional, Gran Via, etc. The staff were very helpful but not intrusive and gave very good advice/suggestions. The room had a very hip, funky appeal, and most importantly it was clean and mercifully quiet thanks to double-pane windows. This is a location where street noise could be dreadful, but although our room had a very large window overlooking a street with several bars/cafes, it was completely quiet when both windows were shut. The breakfast in the cafe downstairs was outstanding.

<Content>A very comfortable and well-located hotel We reserved a standard double room for two nights via the hotel website, which was easy to use. The room was large, well-lit and well-furnished in very modern style, with two big wardrobes, a flat screen TV, a comfortable sofa and a big table. The very big bed was actually two singles lashed together (which we liked, but some might not). The bathroom area had a wonderful large power shower, an excellently lit sink area with plenty of shelf-space and a separate toilet. The bedlinen and towels were excellent quality, and the airconditioning was effective and silent. Everything was spotlessly clean and fresh smelling.Our room looked into an inner courtyard - i.e. no view at all - but the large windows gave plenty of natural light and the location meant that the room was very quiet.Desk staff are very friendly, helpful and courteous. There is no room service. Breakfast was included in our rate and served in the restaurant/cafe next to reception. It was a fairly typical continental buffet (bread, jam, fruit, cold cuts, cheese, eggs and bacon, tea and coffee, juice) etc and more than adequate without being anything special. We would have preferred proper coffee from the espresso machine to the american-style jugs of weak dripolator cofee on offer, but that was the only complaint we could make.The hotel is located in the corner of a really nice, rather up-market square - the Plaza de Santa Anna - which is full of restaurants, tapas bars and cafes and also has a theatre and a childrens playground. It was lively without being raucous until well after midnight and a great place to chill out. The Barrio de las Letras area to the rear of the hotel is full of little bars and restaurants, and the hotel is a very short walk from the Puerta del Sol, and from e.g. the Prado.We thought that this hotel was really good value for money, and was excellently located. We will certainly stay there again if we return to Madrid. Our only caution would be to suggest asking for a room not overlooking the square if you like going to bed early.

<Content>Loved the location Recently returned from Madrid, and would highly recommend this hotel, especially as it is so reasonably priced.Was initially dissapointed with our room, as we had no outlook other than other room windows, but as we didn't really spend a great deal of time in the room it wasn't a major problem. Also don't think it was type of room that I had requested, but clean so no complaints. Would definitely request a room facing square next time.Couldn't fault hotel in any way, staff were very friendly and breakfast was lovely. We also ate in Tapas bar at night, which was delicious.

<Content>Central and Easy-Going We stayed 4 nights in this hotel. 3 nights first, then returned for an extra night after visiting other cities. (Both stays were on weekends) We easily booked the rooms on the website - the only hotel in Spain where we were able to successfully do so on this trip. That alone makes the trip so much easier. We expected it to be like the Standard Hotel in the US in terms of service, efficiency, and hipness. It turned out to be quite true - except that it's a smaller hotel. But thank god no one sipping cocktails at the lobby, a party hotel in a party town would be too much.Room is small but not cramped, since bed is installed at an angle (hard to explain) which maximizes the space. No bathtub (we won't soak in hotel bathtubs anyway), and the shower is built in a way that the water will definitely get the outside floor soaking wet (unfortunate for the ones who does room cleaning).We stayed in one room facing Calle del Prado which we preferred (very cute and old Madrid, facing residences with their screened doored balcony), and another room facing the more bustling Calle del Principe (main thoroughfare for bar-hoppers) which we didn't like as much as it was also on a lower floor. From the floor plan it seemed there are some rooms that don't have outer street views. I will definitely ask for one that does.Floor to ceiling double windows (you cannot open the outer ones though, but they provide much needed sound proofing) with vertical blinds give stretegic view of all the action on Plaza Santa Ana (with tons of restaurants and a great site to see waking up, though we avoided them since they look touristy to us). We easily walked to Chueca, Lavapies, La Latina, Thyssen-Bornemisza, Prado, etc. and never took a taxi or metro (note: we live in New York and do walk a lot) on our entire stay in Madrid except to and from airport and Atocha train station to our next city.A couple of problems. We did have to request new soap after our first night there (being Aug in Madrid for 2, it is essential. Regardless, if the soap is out, we expect it to be replaced). On our last night there, we found during check-in that the safe is busted (the numerical pad is gone and safe is not usable). We wished we were told about it before taking the room. We informed reception (but really was politely confronting) and he only confirmed that it's true it's broken but didn't give an explanation about whether someone forgot their # or someone got their stuff stolen. I think it would have helped if they explained to make visitors feel at ease.Breakfast was okay - not revelatory. We ate much much better outside of the hotel and only ate there the mornings of checkouts, since it's silly to not explore such a great culinary city.We don't know if we will stay there again, because we do like to try new places. But I would not dissuade anyone from staying there.

<Content>Brilliant Stay This hotel was picked on the basis of the reviews on tripadvisor. I would have to say that they were very accurate. Excellent location, price and service. The staff are great and really make you feel welcome. The hotel is on the corner of Plaza Santa Ana which is a brilliant buzzing square. Plenty of eateries and drinking places in the surroundings. Also the arabian spa, hamman medina is worth a visit up the road. One restaurant highly recommended by Lonely planet in this area was a big dissappointment - La Trucha. Really enjoyed the stay though and big thumbs up.

<Content>Loved Room Mate Alicia Hotel Hotel Alicia was great on all accounts. Went with my family including my 16 and 12 year old boys. The location at Plaza Santa Anna is perfectly central to Old Madrid that allows most points of interest to be in walking distance. The facilities were extremely comfortable classic modern European. The staff was incredibly helpful with all our needs including speaking with the airline on our behalf when our luggage was lost.Tapas and sangria tend to be consumed until all hours of the morning. If you're not one of those partaking until the wee hours, request a room on the inside of the hotel, away from the Plaza. Definitely added to the enjoyment of Madrid and the spanish culture.

<Content>fantastic stay What a wonderful find ! Hotel is placed right in the centre of Plaza Santa Anna - a great place to eat and drink. Rooms are clean, spacious and modern. Desk staff amazingly helpful and friendly. Very good value for money, Wouldn't hesitate to return or recommend to others. Just waiting for Hotel Room Mate Oscar to open as I believe this will have a roof top pool - this will be a real bonus in the sweltering summer heat.

<Content>A super hotel We have just returned from a weekend in Madrid and stayed at the Alicia. It was an excellent hotel; very central, right on the corner of Plaza Santa Ana, a lovely square surrounded by small bars and restaurants and within walking distance of shops and lots of places of interest. The Alicia is bright, modern, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The staff were welcoming and very helpful. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to all my friends.

<Content>Superb Hotel Room Mate Alicia is an excellent hotel in a great location for staying in Madrid. We returned last weekend after a 3 night stay at this hotel and couldn't fault anything. My friend and I had an executive double room with the most amazing terrace (ROOM 403) and our other friends had a junior suite (ROOM 303) that was equally impressive. Rooms were spotless and spacious with excellent air conditioning - almost too cold some times so not always necessary! Staff were friendly, polite and helpful at all times and always pleasant and chatty. Breakfast in the tapas bar was also substantial with plenty choice. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again in Madrid. Great hotel, great location and great value.

<Content>Very nice hotel in central location I took a weekend trip to Madrid and booked this hotel based on other reviews on TripAdvisor. I was not disappointed. The hotel is centrally located with a lot of the major plazas within walking distance. Plus it is located on one of the corners of Plaza de Santa Ana. I had a room (#203) overlooking the plaza and had no problems with the noise during my two night stay there. Plaza de Santa Ana has a very active nightlife with many cafes to choose from. The Sangria is great!!!My only complaint is with the hotel's restaurant. After a long day of sightseeing, I decided to have dinner here. The wait staff service was terrible. After I got my main course, I could not get anyone to wait on me. Even after getting the waiter's attention on several occasions. After finally getting his attention, I ordered dessert. That took so long that I finally walked up to the bar and asked for my check. To top it off they still tried to charge me for dessert and coffee. I did notice that all of the Spanish speaking customers had no problems getting service. I also notice that I was the only person with a slightly darker skin and that I seemed to be the only English speaking customer. Just my observations as I looked around the room.Breakfast was included in the room price and I must say it was one of the better breakfasts I have had during my stay in Europe this summer. Besides the standard (i.e. various breads and juice), they served scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and other goodies. Most hotels I have stayed in Europe this summer didn't come close to this.Overall, the people at the hotel were very helpful in recommending other restaurants. I would highly recommend this hotel, but the service in the restaurant prevents me from giving it 5 out of 5.

<Content>The Alicia Room Mate - Great Hotel,Perfect Location We booked a four night break in the Alicia based on the location of the hotel and other reviews we had read. We were not disappointed!The location of the hotel, the Plaza Santa Anna, is perfect for any one wanting to see the main tourist locations in Madrid. Within a short walk of all the main sights. The Plaza Sanat Anna itself is very lively with lots of excellent tapas bars and restaurants in the plaza an neighbouring streets.The hotel is classed as a 3* but the room we had was much more like a 4* room. We booked a Junior Suite which was a corner room, very spacious and well appointed. Design of the room very modern with good tv and hifi. Despite overlooking the lively Plaza, the room was very quite due to the excellent glazing.No facilities in the hotel (hence the 3* rating I guess) but who needs them? A nice breakfast was availbale in the tapas bar next to the hotel (same building really) and there are so many other basr to choose from within 100m of the hotel that it really doesn't matter that there is no bar in the hotel.Staff very helpful and most spoke good English. Can't recommend it enough and I shall certainly consider other Room Mate hotels in future.

<Content>Great location, fun hotel We spent 3 days at the Alicia. The hotel staff was fabulous, very helpful, terrific english skills. Thge bathroom and room set-up is a little avant garde. This is attractive, but that actual arrangements of bathrooms and bed(s) should be clearer as we were 2 friends travelling, and not a couple.

<Content>great hotel, great location - Highly recommend any Room-Mates Absolutely wonderful - location, breakfast staff, room. Just great and the value is wonderful too. Highly recommend a wonderful Italian Restaurant called L'Spirale. Ask for Ana (the owner) or Marcelo (the incredible chef) and tell them their American friends recommended them - you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Great Location Nice, contemporary hotel in central location. Front desk staff very pleasant and English speaking. We booked a Jr suite and were upgraded to a duplex for the first night. Huge balcony and funny little pool. Shower didn't have warm water the following morning and we didn't especially care for the exposed set up. On our 2nd day, we switched to a Jr suite, which we actually preferred since it was on the same level. The staff took care of moving our bags and everything was placed into our room by early afternoon. The air conditioning worked well and was quiet. The room was a great size and overlooked the activities on Plaza Santa Ana. We heard a little bit of noise, but the windows are double paned, and I was prepared with ear plugs. Our sleep was not disturbed in the least. We heard more noise from fellow guests chatting in the hallways and letting their doors slam.Shower worked well, bed was comfortable, room very clean. Enjoyed the buffet breakfast selection, very nice variety. Staff was helpful and friendly.Hotel is within walking distance to many of Madrid's best attractions and the area has many restaurants and cafes to choose from. Would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Hands-down coolest hotel Hotel Alicia's got EVERYTHING: a charming location alongside a bustling plaza in the center of the city, hip minimalist decor, exceptional service, and a pretty extensive breakfast buffet (important when you're still on a Western eating schedule and nothing in summertime-Spain seems to open before noon). When we were arrived we were told that the hotel had run out of double rooms with single beds-- and instead of sticking us with a double with two singles, they placed us in a jr suite at no extra charge :) It was the most incredible room-- clean, cool, and with an incredible view directly into the plaza. It was tough to fight the temptation to stay there all day!

<Content>Estupendo! Great hotel, especially at the price! Staff was extremely friendly, the room was wonderfully designed overall (I especially loved the shower and the floor to ceiling windows), and the location can't be beat. I had a streetside room, with a good view of Plaza Santa Ana, but the room seemed very quiet to me; I had no problems sleeping. I'd fully recommend this hotel to other travelers.

<Content>City centre style Stayed in a duplex for 3 nights, noise concerns weren't an issue, it was just the background hum of a city. Room was funky and had some nice details and big enough for a party, though finishes were poor in areas. The terrace was tops- great for sunbathing and snoozing although the 'pool' was more like a footbath! Breakfast was good and the hotel staff made some nice recommendations for local restaurants (although you do have to ask as the in room guide was clearly not an objective independent review!). Great location in centre of city.

<Content>Nice hotel - a bit noisy. Most of the other TripAdvisor reviews were on target. The hotel is nicely done, modern, and conveniently located to museums (maybe 15 minute walk), Plaza Mayor, etc. A few blocks from three Metro stations, you'll make at least two train changes if you're coming from the airport (A cheap 2 Euro fare each way). Would advise a more expensive (25-35 Euros?)cab for those with lots of luggage. I was upgraded to the two-floor duplex suite- so plenty of space for me. The private outdoor patio area with a view of Plaza Santa Ana was nice. The private outdoor 'swimming pool' for this room is more like a large bathtub, but a nice feature all the same. Would have actually preferred a room all on one floor to avoid hoisting luggage to second level bedroom area. Can't speak for the size/configuration of other rooms. The lift is small by US standards, but sufficient for one or two people and a suitcase or two - and at least there was a lift (uncommon in many European properties). Front desk staff were helpful and English-speaking for those whose Spanish skills are a bit weak. Included breakfast was fine in adjacent cafe - good selection of cold cuts, eggs  bacon, pastries, cereal, fruit, etc. Tables were readily available and clean. With respect to location there are lots of little restaurants and bars in the plaza and nearby. Lots of outdoor seating on the square. On the downside, it might be a bit noisy for light sleepers. On my Wednesday night stay the activity in the square went on well past midnight. Most of the noise on the square is conversational white noise with the windows closed - no worse than you'd find in most urban hotels. Adjacent vehicle traffic and random honking horns seemed unusually loud - even for an urban location - and was harder to adjust to. Might have just been the room I was in since it was at the corner of the square. I was pretty well exhausted, so I slept soundly and was only staying one night so the noise wasn't too off putting. All-in-all, it was a nice stay at a modern clean hotel at a reasonable price and in a convenient location, so I'd consider staying here again.

<Content>Ideal for a first visit to Madrid The hotel is located on the busy Plaza Santa Ana but is very quiet and great value for money. It's a 3 star so although the rooms are small, they are well designed and you have everything you need. A tasty  varied breakfast is provided at the tapas bar by reception and from there you are right at the heart of everything. Plaza Santa Ana bustles into life from midday onwards and all the main sights are within walking distance.

<Content>Fantastic - would definitely recommend 17-21st May. A special break to celebrate my boyfriends birthday so chose the Alicia for the location and the Duplex Suite and we weren't disappointed. The staff are lovely, the Duplex Suite is well worth the money and really made the trip memorable. The breakfast is good, location is excellent with some great bars and tapas restaurants on the adjacent Plaza. Would definitely recommend the Cuban restaurant just down from the hotel. Would definitely stay at a Room Mate again!

<Content>Great Stay at Room Mate Alicia Spent a weekend at Room Mate Alicia in February. Arrived late Friday evening and was greeted by very friendly reception staff. The rooms are really funky - Pop Art design with fantastic showers. Breakfast was also good - lots of fresh bread, cheese, cold meats and pastries. Location is great - right on the corner of a very busy square but the rooms were not noisy - and they have electronically controlled blinds and black out curtains!! Lots of restaurants, bars and great clubs on your doorstep. Overall stay in Madrid was fantastic and I would defintely recommend Room Mate Alicia.

<Content>Met all expectations! I choose Room Mate Alicia based on other traveler's comments so was expecting a good experience. From the moment that you walk into the stylish minimalist lobby with the animated, whimsical, eternally walking lady cartoon you know that is is going to be a fun stay. The open plan rooms (except for the toilet area of course) are comfortable and nicely decorated. The Plaza de Santa Ana is the happening place in Madrid and within walking distance of everything. Finally, the included breakfasts had an exhaustive selection of hot and cold goodies including fresh fruit. The nearby restaurants were all reasonably priced and offered excellent cuisine. I would not stay anywhere else if I returned to Madrid,

<Content>Great hotel and location The Room Mate Alicia is a fantastic find in Madrid. Its location is terrific: the museums and old town are within a ten-minute walk, yet it's on a quiet street with a small square adjacent. The hotel has no parking of its own, but has a special deal (16 Euros/day) with an underground lot a block away. The rooms are very modern but not austere; a spacious glass shower was an unexpected plus. The continental breakfast offered in the restaurant downstairs was quite good and comes with no extra charge. The room and the common areas are well appointed and stylish with great attention to detail. If we return to Madrid we will certainly consider another stay at this hotel, and we would recommend it highly to others. Tip: book your room at least one month in advance to take advantage of the hotel's special rates (we paid 108 E).

<Content>Good, not Great. We stayed in Hotel Alicia for 4 nights, starting on a Sunday. My first impressions were of a nice looking hotel, with the smallest elevators I've ever seen.We had booked an Executive Double room. The room was small and comfortable, but had a terrace that was easily larger than the size of the room and bathroom combined. Perhaps the need to maintain the building in its original state has ruled out extending the room at the expense of the terrace. Regardless, the terrace was very pleasant and came with two loungers to relax on. When we booked the room through travel-intelligence.net the executive rooms were described as having a bath. Well, maybe one of the two executives does, but the one I stayed in didn't. That said, we were also charged a rate about 鈧?0 cheaper per night than our booking confirmation had suggested, so perhaps the one with the bath was more expensive. Several people have remarked on the noise from the Plaza. The only time this affected me was early Monday morning, when the sound of what I assume was garbage collection was very loud and went on for 25/30 minutes. This didn't happen any other morning, to my relief. I imagine we were helped by not staying over the weekend, so we didn't hear any loud revelry from the surrounding area. The only other downside was a broken safe. We didn't complain about this at the time - we really didn't have too much to lock away.The staff were all very friendly, and the breakfasts were good. Much of what other people have said about the staff serving breakfast is true - they seem slow to clean up and while I didn't go hungry due to their failure to replenish the food perhaps some others did. You needed a bit of luck with the timing. Ultimately this hotel is a good option for those prioritising location. It is quite close to many of the biggest attractions in Madrid, and it won't break the bank. It might be more suited to younger travellers rather than old, as I imagine in peak times and at weekends the noise could be frustrating.

<Content>My mate, Room Mate! Room Mate Alicia is a wonderful, modern hotel. We would have no hesitation staying here again on our next visit to Madrid.We had a standard room (302), which was of more than adequate size with very tasteful  contempory decor.We wanted to stay for more than our original booking of two nights, but the hotel was already fully booked.The staff were very helpful, even managing to book us another hotel close by, when we had already made many phone calls without success.Noise was a very minor issue, but what do you expect in a large capital city!Of the four hotels we stayed in, this was by far the best in all respects.

<Content>No problem with this hotel This is a new, nice hotel, in Madrid old part of the city. We paid 117鈧瑄ros for a double room, breakfast included, and think it is a little bit pricey. If i could get it for 80/90 鈧瑄ros I would go again, for sure, but for 117 euros I think you can get something better.Location is grat if you like old Madrid and Tapas

<Content>Amazing hotel What a lovely hotel...well recommended. Reception staff very helpful and pleasant.Clean, boutique style, very fashionable and modern.we had a duplex room... amazing...on two floors with a large garden terrace overlooking the square. Decorated with shrubs, plenty of outdoor seating and sun loungers on the terrace by the side of the small plunge pool.Rooms them selves were lovely...large sitting room with amazingly large sofa's, plasma tv, c.d, table and seating, minibar. Lovely lighting and decor.Bedroom and bathroom upstairs...large bed, great lighting, lots of electronic blinds etc etc. All positives about the accommodation. Well placed hotel, nearest metro, Sol.Breakfast in adjoining tapas bar/cafe. Lovely range of food in buffet, can be a little busy if all dine at once and the staffing levels don't change. Lovely scrambled eggs!No complaints about the hotel at all.Would definately stay there again without hesitation...well worth the money!Tip...taxi's expensive from airport, can be 40 Euro's but the metro is so easy and well signed from the airport, (I think it was terminal 2, but am forgetting already, but it is well signed). It took us about 40 mins and only cost 1 Euro. We had to change three times, but they were all connecting tubes...no problem!As for Madrid, it is a pleasant city with lots of old buildings...the madrid vision bus tour is a must...20 Euro's for 2 days. There are lots of beggars with deformaties around the main squares, which is sad. On the whole a very pleasant stay.

<Content>Great Place Great location near bars etc. Do not have a room on the outside of the hotel. The double glazing does not work and they party until 4am every night. Noise is terrible. air conditioning not brilliant.Very clean and modern. Water rather than apples would have been a good idea. Staff were really helpful. English was reasonable.The restaurant where you have breakfast was disappointing. It was dirty and the staff were very sullen. Breakfast itself was good.Would recommend.

<Content>A great hotel for the price We spent two nights at the RM Alicia in mid-March. The location is superb, and so much in the heart of things that when we saw our first floor junior suite we were worried about potential noise and lack of privacy. But no cause for concern - a rather too sophisticated set of electrically controlled blinds covered up the vast bank of floor to ceiling windows. A stylish, comfortable and spacious room, and great value. Reception very helpful, too. Only one downside - the breakfast included in the rate was at the adjoining cafe / tapas bar (under separate ownership, I think), but service there was unacceptably slow and off-hand.

<Content>Perfect location, shame about the noise from the square.... thoroughly enjoyed out stay in this perfectly located small hotel but our visit was spoilt by the noise coming from the square at night as most people do not seem to go to bed until well after our normal bedtimes! The double glazing is insufficient to block out external noises.The breakfast was well presented and fresh, however, the restaurant staff were surly and lazy - tables left uncleared etc. The spanish certainly seemed to get preferable treatment!Overall a great place to stay, reception staff were very helpful and suggested good places to eat, drink etc. and the location was perfect.The trip on the metro from the airport is extremely easy and we would recommend attempting it - it only costs 1 euro!S Melrose and L Hilliard
