<Content>Loved the Cosmo. Friendly staff We loved this hotel... super clean... very modern and extremely helpful staff. We checked into this hotel after a bad experience at another hotel... and were relieved when we walked in the door. Super clean room, the bathroom was very clean and modern, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The staff helped us navigate our way to the train the next morning with bus schedules, train schedules and maps. Also, since we were leaving before the 7 am breakfast... they put together an early breakfast just for us so that we could have a bite to eat before our trip to Rome. I really enjoyed my stay and I will always look for a concept hotel in whatever city I choose to visit.

<Content>Great service and ambient at the Cosmopolitan! We stayed at the Cosmopolitan at the end of July, beginning of August for about a week with another couple we were traveling with. The Cosmopolitan was a clean, sophisticated hotel with a modern feel! The bus ride to downtown from the hotel was very straightforward and quick, hardly any wait time for the bus. The staff at the hotel was amazingly helpful! They gave the best recommendations to local restaurants and shopping areas, based on their own experiences and what they thought you would most likely enjoy! They gave you multiple options to chose from and catered their recommendations to exactly what you were looking for!!! We definitely took advantage of their recommendations, and really got a feel for the city and the Italian culture! Honestly, the best concierge and reception service I've experienced. The breakfast was great as well, five star American-buffet with an Italian touch! Definitely worth staying here if you're in Florence!

<Content>Great Hotel at on odd place We stayed in this great hotel for only one night: 31july - 1 aug on the top floor. We were travelling from Rome (4 days) to Desenzano del Garda (5 days) and used Florence (2 days) as a stop in between. The room was very spacious, clean and modern. Actually it was one of the best rooms we stayed in years. A cool gimmick was the entertainment set with the internet connection. One thing that struck me the most was the comfortable bed, not hard not soft, very very good. Also the bed sheets were nice. I mention these things because it is a rare thing to have such a good bed on vacation.The woman behind the desk is very helpful and friendly. She gave us some good tips for our trip north. The breakfast is also good, fresh fruit etc. its nice. We haven't heard no noise from other hotel guests or elevator. One small issue I have to mention was the smell of cigarette smokein our room. Although it wasn't allowed to smoke in the hotel, some people were clearly smoking in their room. The smell was distributed through the air-conditioning. We cant blame the hotel fully, but connecting the airco system with different rooms isn't very wise. My advise is to lay a piece of paper in each room with a warning that if people smoke they have to pay 50 euro extra for cleaning. You see this in many hotels. Some less attractive point is the location. Although it is located in a relatively good part of the city (not in the centre) getting there is going to cost you money. During the afternoon you can use the bus to go the centre, but in the evening we wouldn't advise this. Using a taxi is about 10-15 euro (one way). To conclude, our stay was very good and we certainly recommend it to other people. The price of 125 p night is really worth it.

<Content>Good value off-the-beaten-track in Florence We were visiting friends in Pistoia, west of Florence, and chose this hotel on the outskirts of Florence with their convenience in mind. But we were really delighted to discover that the hotel we had chosen based on its (decidedly untouristy) location was so elegant and comfortable! I suspect the hotel primarily serves a business clientele, but the professional, friendly and helpful staff also anticipate the needs and desires of leisure travellers. Historic Florence is indeed an easy and short (about 10-15 minutes) bus ride away, and the hotel will provide you with a good map of Florence and its environs (large enough to show the location of the hotel, which the usual 鈥淔lorence Center鈥?maps would not encompass), information about taking the bus, and will sell you bus tickets at the front desk. Our room was immaculate, well-appointed and quiet 鈥?apparently well soundproofed, as the hotel is located on a somewhat busy street. There鈥檚 a very nice buffet breakfast. On the first evening of our stay, we were too tired from travelling to venture into the city for dinner, so we asked the front desk staff if there was a trattoria nearby. They recommended Otto e Mezzo, just a couple blocks from the hotel, where, as it turns out, we had probably the best meal of our two-week vacation in Italy. This is about as genuine a dining experience as you鈥檙e likely to have in any metropolitan area in Italy 鈥?a true neighborhood place with loads of character. But despite the restaurant鈥檚 out-of-the-way location and neighborhood feel, the food is creative and not at all traditional, except in the typically Italian way that it showcases the freshest of in-season ingredients. Otto e Mezzo is a real treat that I think is worth making the trip from anywhere in Florence.In summary, the Cosmopolitan Concept Hotel is not the place to stay if you want to step out of your hotel and see Renaissance monuments surrounding you. And, yes, the neighborhood can be a little edgy at night. But if you want to get a whole lot more for your money than you would in the Centro Storico, and have a great meal nearby, I couldn鈥檛 recommend this place more highly.

<Content>Tiny room We stay 4 nights in june, is a new hotel and we don't understand why they built so tiny rooms ! We don't have place for the luggage,the bathroom is also very small you can't use the bidet because it is very close to the toilet seat . The staff is very nice and helpfull, the breakfast is very good. The location - 10 minutes by bus, the problem is that the bus is full with unlegal workers that lives near , the bus stop near the train station at night is realy unpleasent to wait so we have to use a taxi ( 15 EU ) one way .The hotel must have a shutlle to the center if they want to survive !! At least there are a lot of prostitutes near the hotel and it is very unpleasent !!

<Content>Very stylish and comfortable, a bit out of the way The Cosmopolitan is a clean, stylish, and extremely comfortable hotel just outside Florence's old city center. Using the bus was very easy, and we never waited more than a couple minutes either going to the center or coming back. But if you need to stay in the center or dislike public transportation, probably not the ideal choice.Although Florence offers so much to see, we found ourselves spending time in the room, with its great shower, comfy bed, and a nice TV. Breakfast was included in our rate, and it was a good spread. Weekends are apparently very slow since most of the clientele is businesspeople, so the rates can be quite good then.We enjoyed a nearby Italian restaurant (just past Pizzaman) recommended by the staff. Pizzaman's ok too.

<Content>Stylish hotel, great service We stayed for a whole week in Februrary. The hotel is really close to the airport (without hearing any noise), which makes it great as a starting point for rental car excursions. Plus for free, easy and safe parking! It was also really easy to go to the city centre by bus, which was quite cheap as opposed to the taxis - not recommended.The service was excellent. We got all the help we needed and more. The room was nice, but a bit small (we had the regular double room). This hotel is recommended for all who wants use Firenze as a base for car trips in Toscana, like we did! :-)

<Content>Cool hotel We liked this hotel.Though it's a little bit out of way.But it's worth of it.With bus no 29,30,35,it's very easy to get to the city center.Plus two supermarkets nearby,it's very convenient.The staff are friendly.They can even tell my name when we first entered the hotel.We stayed for five days,nice buffet breakfast everyday.The hotel is very new,room not very big but adequate.All the equipment just spakling new and modern.Plus friendly price(120 euros per day,breakfast included),I can't think of anything else to complain besides location.

<Content>Chic property at a great price We stayed two nights and parked for free in the parking lot next door, it is in front of a rug store (if there are no free carspaces you can park for 5 euro a night across the road where the hotel has a deal).The hotel room was very chic, a little small, but the bed was super comfortable and the bathroom sleek and modern. Even their washroom amenities in the lobby were impressive. The hotel is approximately a 15 minute bus ride to the Old Town and the bus stop is right out the front and reception sells the bus tickets so it couldn't be easier.The breakfast offered, eggs, bacon and fresh meats, cheeses, yoghurts, cereals, juices etc. A great start to the day.The team were very helpful.We were very impressed with the modern design for the price. If you want to be close to all the tourist action this property may not be for you as you have to commute in. It was convenient for us as we had a car and spent one day travelling to the warehouse malls.

<Content>great hotel, amazing breakfast We loved this hotel. The decor,bathroom,bedding and most important the great spread of breakfast. The breakfast alone was worth twenty Euro and I miss it very much. The staff was nice and spoke great english. The only negative is the location. The bus ride was like 15 minutes. I highy reccomend Quatro Amici near the station for a great lunch and dinner. Have a great hot chocolate at Rivore and eat all the gelato you can all over.

<Content>Great hotel Great hotel, nice staff, very nice rooms, up to North American 4 star standard. The actual hotel is just like the pictures on the hotel website.Its a little ways from the center of Florence, I don't think its within reasonable walking distance. You can buy bus tickets from the reception desk (if I remember it correctly its around 1.2 Euros each). Bus stop is right outside the hotel very convienient. I think a taxi is about 12 Euros (10-15 Euros depending on the traffic).We took the taxi to the hotel as we didn't want the hassle of trying to find the place with our suit cases. Its worth it.Not many resturants around the hotel. There is a little sandwich place a couple of blocks away it is very modern and nice if you want something small. If you order wine at night they have finger food included.

<Content>Awesome! This hotel was simply excellent! It was clean, modern, tastefully designed, and the hotel staff was very helpful. We can't say enough good things. We wish we stayed for more than one night. It is very easy to take the bus into the center of the city, yet it is close to the airport.We had found the hotel through tripadvisor, and just feel so lucky that we found it. I would stay here again in the future if ever going back to Florence. We were so happy with it, that we wanted to write a review to tell others of our good fortune in finding this hotel.

<Content>Awesome Hotel All around This hotel a the best we stayed at all through Italy. This was a perfectly clean, quiet, comfortable hotel with a delicious breakfast and staff that was willing to help you with your every need. The bus stops right out front and it is a straight shot into the city center with a short 10 minute ride. The staff recommended an authentic Italian restuarant which was fantastic...just study up on your Italian before going. We would not book anywhere else when travelling to Florence again!

<Content>Great Firenze Hotel! I booked this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews and was not disappointed. The hotel is very modern, very clean, and not too far away from the city center. And the location is quite possibly the only drawback, if you think a ten minute ride by bus to city center is unthinkable. We didn't have a problem with it and the bus stop is only about half a block down from the hotel. You can even buy bus tickets from the front desk of the hotel. If you would like to take the taxi, from the train station (Sta. Maria Novella) it's about a 15 euro trip going to the hotel and for some reason a 20 euro trip going back to the train station (I think we were hustled out of that return trip) which is supposedly dependent on the number of people and number of luggage that is transported. The shower is clean and immaculate. The beds are very nice and comfortable. I stayed in a twin room with my brother which was a little smaller than the double room my parents stayed in next door. The size of the twin room was still fine. You get a nice flat-panel tv, air-conditioning after a long day of sightseeing, and a nice breakfast with eggs (and bacon if you wake up early enough). I saw both Trafalgar and Globus tours staying at the hotel during our four days. Great price for a swanky, modern hotel in Firenze!

<Content>Great modern hotel.... Although a bit out of the city center , Concept Hotel is a excellent formula if you want to have a highly comfortable , modern and equipped lodging in Florence. The 15 minutes drive to the city ( and easy parking at the hotel ) , is easy and straight to park your car at the train station. If you want , buses and taxis are available right at your door steps.The room is very modern , clean and equipped... Shower a bit small , but nothing to disturb too much.Would come back..

<Content>Modern Digs in Florence We stayed for 4 nights at the Cosmopolitan and loved it. The girls at the front desk were extremely helpful. The room had all the modern amenities, and was impeccably clean. My husband and I compared it to a boutique hotel in New York. The ONLY drawback, is that it's not in the city center, so we took taxis everyday (my husband has a phobia of public transportation) to get back and forth, which were about 12-15 EU each trip. Also, we had a concept suite and the shower was very small, barely enough room to move around, but we managed! Overall, I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Best Hotel I have ever spent the night! My partner and I wanted a hotel not too far from the airport, since we were arriving into Florence late, and did not want to mess with a downtown hotel. I booked two nights into the Cosmopolitan Concept Hotel, and I must say it was possibly the nicest hotel I have stayed in. It is very modern and clean. The door key only had to be waved near the door to your room to unlock the door (no more spending minutes trying to figure out how the key works!) How cool! The room, wow! Nice pillow -top beds with very high quality sheets and Duvets. Huge comfy pillows. Flat screen TV with all sorts of option like pay per view movies in English. High quality furniture. And don't get me started on the bathroom! What a luxury! I did not want to leave the bathroom! From marble floor and shower to the really cool sink, which I think is called a vessel these days. Huge comfy towls with very nice soaps and shampoos. And the hotel staff was wonderful! Very nice and bent over backwords to help. I wanted to wash some clothes since we had been travelling for about ten days already, so I called the front desk. Of course she suggested the hotel laundry service, but I admitted that I did not want to spend that kind of money, since we had a lot of clothes to clean. Sure enough, a few minutes later, she called back, and told me she had located a self service laundrymat within walking distance to the hotel! OK, the hotel is not downtown, or within walking distance to everything. But we took a bus, there is a stop right in front of the hotel, and it drops you right off in front of the main train station ten minutes later. It could not have been easier! They will even sell you the bus tickets at the hotel front desk, and tell you exactly what you need to do. We had pre-paid rooms at the Globus Hotel in downtown for the next five nights, and let me tell you, we really missed the CC Hotel. If we had not prepaid for the Globus, we would have been right back there. And it was much cheaper then the Globus!

<Content>Clean and Modern We were on a 2 week tour of Europe(trafalgar) this summer and stayed here for 2 days. It was the nicest hotel that we stayed in during the 15 day trip. Everything is new, modern and clean. The breakfast was delicious too. Fresh baked pastries and hot items. It was a bit of a drive into town so it might not work if you are traveling solo, but with the bus we didn't have to worry about that. All in all a nice clean place to stay while in florence.

<Content>best hotel in florence! We stayed in many 4 star hotels while in Tuscany for our 3-week honeymoon. Prices ranged from 250-400 Euros. Our final night prior to our flight out of Florence, I inquired about hotels for a final, one night stay at the Information Desk in the Florence Airport. The lady showed me the list of 4 star hotels close to the airport and then located them in a booklet to view pics. The Cosmopolitan had only been open for 10 days so there were no pictures available. When I requested COMFORT COMFORT COMFORT, she recommended The Cosmopolitan Hotel. The following day, I went back to thank the Information Desk lady and told her that she should recommend that hotel to EVERYONE staying in Florence! It was BY FAR the most comfortable hotel we stayed in and was far less expensive than the others! The room is decorated in a very New York City design and is very clean. While it is not in walking distance to the tourist sites, the stores nearby are far better than those in the tourist locales...far more up-to-date and local prices. We asked the front desk of a restaurant they could recommend. We went to Trattoria Il Poeta...this is a locally owned restaurant that was, without a doubt, the BEST restaurant we'd dined with our entire visit!! We loved the hotel so much that we brought them back a nice order of food! I wish they'd been open our entire trip as we would have stayed there the whole time  just taken day trips to surrounding cities. This is a MUST stay...especially if you desire comfort  great service!
