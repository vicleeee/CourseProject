<Content>what a messy noisy place very difficult to find We took about 2 hrs looking for this hotel and its in a dingy side of town! In the process of getting lost we found ourselves in Old town, in cruise traffic and endless construction tunnels and bridges! finally from the parking lot of the hilton across the lagoon we see it lost in some other buildings! not what you see on the adverts! the young lady on duty at the front desk was very friendly but the older one either the manager or the owner was no rude and had no time really to attend to you. we got a room 201 which was so noisy the traffic the ac machine and we were moved to a smaller queiter 208. with a child we needed a microwave and had to practicaly move it for our selves! both rooms were clean and the showers too but the air was so stale the fan had to be on all the time!we spent 4 nights here but i would not return, i have stayed in better places for much less than what we paid for. and not forgetting the horrible continental breakfast, however the chef/attendant was so kind and helpful he made eating that junk fun he was from new york his english was great!in short was a terrible welcome to puerto rico i will return but not stay here.

<Content>Not what I expected............ The hotel is close to the airport but there is no shuttle service. Becareful how you book your hotel online because the lady at the front desk will try to charge you for some tax that you think is included with your online fee and it may or may not be included.The ROOM. It was stuffy like it was never used. The room had a moldy smell. I was not pleased with this unpleasant smell. There only excuse was the air was not turned on, so the room is stuffy.The hotel is in downtown San Juan. It is on the bus line. No much in the downtown area but businesses and small stores. Everything for tourist is in Old San Juan.If you rent a car you will have to park on the street or on side of the building. If you park on side of the building the front desk will ask for your keys so they can move your car because the parking is where you would park one car behind the other. There is no pool but the hotel is not far from the beach.There is not a whole lot of variety of resturants to choose from.This hotel should be your last desperate choice. I would not recommend.

<Content>It was decent We got a good deal with Expedia airplane and hotel. I checked the reviews and it seemed OK. We couldn't complain the hotel room was spotless clean. Yes, it is old, i didn't smell any mold though but I noticed the carpet and the comforter were worn out. I liked the fact that we had a microwave and a mini fridge that we stock w drinks. Our cleaning lady was super nice, she always left our room clean, bring us fresh towels and ask us if we needed help. Same with reception. I could have pass on the breakfast though, the food not that good. It is continental breakfast, cereal and fruit and after a couple of days I was tired of it. To go to the beach or to Ashford St you have to walk like 10 min, not bad, a lot of people ( even locals) are walking out at night and we saw cops too. However you have to pass under a dark bridge though. Next time, I would choose a hotel in Isla Verde, the beach is WAY nicer than Condado.

<Content>There are a lot better places to stay in San Juan The rooms smelled awful. The curtains smelled like urine and mold, and the carpets were dirty. Through the windows you could look into the dilapidated building next door. We checked in around 8pm and asked if there was a place we could get a bite to eat, and the desk staff told us there was a Subway up the street a few blocks. We walked up and experienced the local homeless sleeping in their boxes, and a few shady types lurking in doorways. There is nothing to do at or very near the hotel. For a bite to eat, go the Los Pinos Cafe, about a block from the hotel. It's a local cafe where you can get red beans and rice and authentic Puerto Rican fare, and a local beer. The wait staff there is friendly and speaks multiple languages. You can go up on the roof and look at the neighboring buildings falling down and the endless construction cranes. Don't expect spectacular views of the ocean in its glory, or the mountains, either. The continental breakfast consisted of boxed doughnuts and canned pineapple, which were sitting out way too long. You could get a stale bagel for $2 from an uninterested woman who spent much time talking on her cell phone while purportedly cleaning up the breakfast area and helping the guests. You can walk to the beach, about fifteen minutes away. It is tiny, and across from the police station (that should make you feel safe..). You walk through the park where the homeless live, and it smells of urine and general filth. You can also walk through the tent city, where the protesters are set up to try to stop what they determine to be illegal construction. Seems that most of the beachfront has been bought up by chain hotels, and the buildings go right up to the water, and the tall buildings stop the ocean breezes from coming into the city, so the whole area is hot and stagnant. There must be a lot of places to stay in San Juan that are much more pleasant. The one nice thing was that the hotel desk staff were very nice. They hailed us a cab so we could get back to the airport and it was there is just a few minutes. They speak very good English.

<Content>The worse Hotel in earth!!!!!! This was the worse hotel I have stayed in. Starting with bed bugs, old and deteriorated bathrooms, the hallways and room had a weird smell. My friends and I wish we had Lysol. One of my friends even sprayed one of my perfumes. Top of all were the rude staff and manager or owner (Juan). Instead of admitting that his staff made a mistake; he treated all of us like criminals by making threats to call the police. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Everyone in Puerto Rico was very friendly except for the people in this horrible hotel.

<Content>Hair in the Tub We stayed at the Hotel Miramar in March 2008 before we left on a cruise. I viewed some of the Trip Advisor photos and there must be a difference between the Hotel Miramar and The Courtyard Miramar because the photos of the Courtyard looked much nicer than where we stayed. Overall, our stay was pleasant. This hotel is in a dangerous part of town so do not venture out alone at night. This is an old hotel, but kept up well. My main and only complaint would be that there was a lot of hair in the shower (and I mean a lot- 10 or more pieces) and there was hair in the bathroom sink. The blanket on the bed was also very old and worn looking-- I would not touch it.This is a 3 star hotel... so once again you get what you pay for.

<Content>Our one night stay. We arrived the hotel late on january 19th. An elderly man meet us, checked us in, and pointed out the elevator for us. We stayed on the 4.th floor, to the left out of the elevator, and in the last room on the left side of the hallway. A large room with two large beds, a small fridge, tv, a comfortable chair, and a bathroom. We have nothing to complain about regarding the room, and we slept well in the beds. The aircondition were a little bit noisy, but did not ruin our nights sleep. We went down a couple of floors and found the ice machine. I am glad we did not have a room there. It made a lot of noise. Also fount a soda machine there.Did not have breakfast there, but walked to Wahlgreens a couple of blocks away to get some soda and water for our upcomming cruise.Checked out just before 12, and a nice man at the desk rang for a taxi to pick us up.Overall not the best hotel we have stayed on, but most certainly not the worst. We could easily stay here another time, just for one night.

<Content>Give it a miss Looking at some of the reviews I was expecting a decent hotel. I should have taken note of the other comments. It is difficult to reconcile the positive comments about this hotel with the hotel I stayed in and it makes me wonder whether some of the positive comments are connected with the owners as they are so far out from my experience or whether there is another hotel of the same name.Its not near a beach unless near means far. Its near nothing actually. My room was smelly and you couldn't walk barefeet on the carpet without feet sticking to it. ughh.Avoid

<Content>Not a hotel for long vacations We stayed at Hotel Miramar for just one night. It is not a hotel where I would stay longer. The location is not great. It is not close to any of the sights. You have to take a taxi to the old city and the best beaches. The room was ok. It was big and very peaceful. But the breakfast was awful. We got to the restaurant half an hour before the breakfast ended and it was no food left and the woman working there would not bring out more food.

<Content>Concrete Block I was very disappointed in this hotel because it was concrete inside and out. I have never stayed in a room with concrete walls, and hope never to again! The staff was nice, but the hotel is on the fringe of a very bad neighborhood and we would not have felt comfortable walking. I had thought the hotel was very close to Old San Juan from their website, but it is about a $12 cab ride away.

<Content>Run now while you can Thought that by picking a cheap hotel I could save a lot. Not this one. Except for a couple of staff, I've never seen rudeness so institutionalized in one place from the owner down to the support staff. The rooms are old and worn. Bathrooms are scarily decrepit with tiles chipped off. Thanks god, there is the outside and that's what I did when I was booked in this rodent's nest- stayed outside most of the time expect when it's time to sleep......and you better be really exhausted...

<Content>Absolutely wonderful!!!!! While this is rated a 2 star hotel, don't let this make your decision for you. This is an older, quaint hotel. The staff there are all nice, but Ramone and Sylvia make the hotel what it is.They are some of the best front desk staff I have ever run into. I hated to leave them as much as Puerto Rico!!! They want to know your plans and are always willing to suggest something. They really just bend over backwards to help you. The rooms are large and accommadating. The parking is sparse, but if you give your keys to the front desk staff they will park it for you. (Another plus) The free continental breakfast is standard fare: cereal, sweet rolls, french bread, coffee, juice and jams. They also have free internet for you to use, which is a plus in this technology addicted world: I was able to check my email.

<Content>You could not pay me to stay here. Paid a very low rate, as they say you get what you pay for. The hotel manager, very rude and full of himself. We arrived at 4:00pm was given the room, took the luggage to the room, opened the door, the room was not cleaned from the prior guest, I did state we arrived at 4:00pm!!!! I returned to the front desk, the young lady was apologetic and gave us a new room, she even went up and checked the room before we lugged or luggage back up to the quest rooms. The room was ok, but the ice machine is not inside a stair well or a room on its own, it is in the hallway of the quest floor, all night you can here the ice machine dropping ice into the bottom of the machines' holding area. The first shower I took, I tried to adjust the shower head and it came off in my hand, the next morning I gave the shower head to the manager, as he gave it to his maintenance person the manager rolled his eyes and asked me was their anything else broken in the room . I replied not at this time. Later that day when we return from the beach, I tried to adjust the air conditioners fan speed, but could not because that was broken. The maid service starts at 7:00am sharp, we know because the wheels on the maid service cart squeal load enough to wake you up, if that doesn't wake you the maids talking loudly, and their buckets hitting the wall, cart, ice machine, doors, will. I could continue but you get the point. I haven't had the opportunity to go to Europe yet, but if this is a European style hotel, no thanks, I'll pass.

<Content>Horrible experience Do Not Go, Find another hotel I am writing this review about the Hotel Miramar, 606 Ponce de Leon Avenue, San Juan. Please DO NOT confuse this with the Marriot Miramar. I made a reservation through Priceline and received confirmation for the Hotel Miramar for one night prior to our cruise leaving. We arrived at the hotel at 1:30 am. Upon arrival a woman comes out to the street (this hotel is located on a dark side street in San Juan) and asks us if we have reservations. I thought it most peculiar, but said yes, we have reservations and confirmation (room already paid for) through Priceline. I then give her the paper with confirmation # and payment record, and she says, We don't have a reservation for you I said,  Here it is, it's already paid for. She says no, I have no room for you. I said, OK, just give us a room and we will pay for it. (thinking that I will sort all this out when we get home)She then says, there are no rooms available here, they are all taken. So we get back into the taxi, and our driver feels so sorry for us that he starts to call other hotels to see if he can get us a room. Meantime, we are sitting in front of the Miramar when another taxi pulls up. Two people get out and go in with their travel packet and yep.....sure enough they get a room! Meantime the taxi driver is having a difficult time since all hotel rooms are booked up in San Juan. Finally he calls the Best Western who just had an airline crew cancellation! We go there and I am telling the from desk clerk about our experirence with the Miramar Hotel and he said there were two other people who checked in earlier that the same thing had happened to. The Hotel Miramar was unsympathetic, and totally unresponsive. I would tell everyone out there, don't go.....it was an awful experience for 2 very experienced travelers. I have contacted Priceline for them to resolve this... Stay clear of this place, you don't want to end up like we did.

<Content>Horrible Experience at the Hotel Miramar I stayed at the Hotel Miramar with my family prior to our Caribbean cruise. Thankfully, we were there for only 1 night. It is by far the worst experience at a hotel that I have ever encountered. We requested one room for a family of 4 and were given 鈥渢he biggest room鈥? Granted, the room is relatively spacious, but none of us felt comfortable at all to really get good sleep. For starters, we found hairs on the bed sheets, as well as stains on the bed covers. Because I tend to get cold at night, I reluctantly still pulled the covers over me. As I started to fluff the comforter I started to smell this鈥dor. When I took a sniff I realize the odor came from the stained, dirty, and now stinky comforter. Needless to say, I just opened my suitcase and grabbed a sweater and slept in it instead to keep warm. The toilet itself is so dirty and filled with grim that I wish there were toilet seat covers provided. The bathroom itself just gave us a really unclean sense of feeling and I felt showering in it might get me dirtier. In fact, all of us opt to forgo the shower, so we can leave this 鈥渉otel鈥?as soon as possible and get on our cruise ship!Despite paying extra for the 2 additional people, breakfast was only provided for 2. I did not go for breakfast, but those that did, said it was mediocre at best and we all still went out somewhere else to grab a bit.The area around the hotel doesn鈥檛 necessary feel unsafe, but I surely will not stroll around there at night with my family.Over, this was a HUGE disappointment of a hotel. I would never ever stay at this hotel again, and will not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Terrific staff...good value A really good value for a minimal cost. Clean, good location, great staff. Standard economy class with plenty of towels, clean linen, the convenience of a micro wave and fridge. Spacious rooms and a European style atmosphere and continential breakfast. Easy access to taxi, bus line, and the convenience of neighboring shopping with a 24 hour cafe nearby. I would avoid the high cost of dining at the hotel with so many options nearby.Don't even think about renting a car! Parking and driving are beyond anything to which you may be accustom. You can travel almost anywhere by metro bus or train.We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great deal for the money We stayed here a few weeks ago for 2 nights. My wife and I and our 2 year old enjoyed our stay..(pre cruise). My little boy loved playing with the birds behind the lobby. The foods next door was good. Nice central location. Re Taxis: Always get a rate PRIOR to leaving the Hotel....we took 3 trips to Old San Juan and had 3 different rates 7.00/10.00/18.00...cruise ship port is about 2 miles away

<Content>Wouldn't stay here again We stayed at Miramar Hotel for one night and, thankfully, we were only there for a night. In inspecting the room, I found a couple of hairs on the bed sheets and noticed that the comforter had stains on them so we slept without the comforter on. The room was large and did have a refrigerator, however, the refrigerator was not working properly. The breakfast which is included is a joke, a couple of slices of cold toast, old coffee sitting in a coffee pot and some cold cereal. We ended up just paying for a hot breakfast not worth the additional money. Plus the area where the hotel is located is not good and pretty scary at night. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Best, Irene from Brooklyn

<Content>Worst Hotel This hotel during the whole course of our stay was the worst hotel experience i ever had. we booked 2 rooms in this hotel ahead of time but as soon as we arrived, there was no room available for us. The hotel manager/ owner has the WORST attitude.The standard room can have max of 4 persons, but the built in individual water heater can only provide hot water good for 2 persons. The room isnt clean and room service is worst. Twice our room was not cleaned although you already put a maid service request for clean up. The free breakfast? its regretable. They lack utensils to serve their guests. worst food. THIS HOTEL DESERVES NO STAR AT ALL. DON'T BOOK THIS HOTEL.

<Content>not to bad I stayed in this hotel for 5 days during the month of July... the hotel is in a good location if you have a car because Old San Juan and San Juan a pretty close by. Otherwise I would not walk around the neighborhood where the hotel is located because it looks pretty abandoned. on the other hand, the hotel stay was good for the first day but then we noticed a turn around regarding the night staff at this hotel. The front desk demanded that we go downstairs to the lobby to retrieve extra towels and sheets! Simply because he was too tired. To make matters worse, we were not told of the free parking and again we were treated as if we were here for free (which we were not!) Overall, the rooms were cleaned everyday and the bathroom was clean but the way the night shift staff treated us was unprofessional and uncalled for. I would pay extra for the proper service anytime.

<Content>Good  I stayed here for 2 nights on trip for my class reunion. My room was bigger than I had expected with lots of drawer space. View thru window was bad but I did not come to PR to look out my window INSIDE a hotel room. Microwave and mini-fridge was great to have and free-breakfast even better. Room was very clean. Staff was friendly and helpful when needed. I would have prefered to have internet connectivity IN the room, instead of having to go to lobby sitting area for the wireless. Hotel is a block from the Dept. of Justice and walking distance to restaurants, banks, food store, etc.Rooftop sun deck had a GREAT view!... perhaps needing a hot tub for perfection since a pool is out of the question in that space. ;-) Overall, above expectations for the price and in a good location!

<Content>Good for the money We got a great deal on this room and only paid $60 a night via Sky Auction. Other than that I would not have paid more than $100 per night for this place. I am giving it an average rating based on what we paid. The hotel is not a place to hang out. It is only good for a shower and sleep after touring the city. We stayed here for 2 days only, and went to 4 star hotels the remainder of our 5 days. The room itself was dark and dinghy, but the bathroom was very clean. Parking here is free, which is a great thing if you rent a car because we paid $15 and $22 a night, respectively for valet parking in the other hotels. This is no where near the beach. We asked the front desk how far a walk to the beach and she said 7 minutes. I highly doubt it. Jus to get to the beach you have to walk on the freeway ramp and through heavy traffic to get to a rather dumpy looking beach in Condado. I suppose you could walk further down to the beach in front of the other hotels, but the entire walk would have taken 35 minutes. Anyhow, this hotel was a good deal for what we paid for and is so close to Old San Juan when you rent a car.

<Content>Mixed feelings My family of four, one 16 year old, 12 year old and husband and I stayed at the Miriamar from May 8 through the 12. When we arrived we were tired and hot from the trip. We registered in and were told we had a room on the third floor. But guess what we had to walk up to our room and carry our luggage. Now if any one knows a women and a pre teen girl can bring a lot of luggage. So up we all went with all this stuff. Went into our room and to our supprise it was a room with a king. I did tell them we needed a room with double beds. Found the maid in the hall way and tried to explain to her we needed a bigger room, she spoke no english and my spanish is not the best. make a long story short we did get a room with two beds. We did notice the room did have a musty smell and the AC did not work well. The house cleaning was not at all good. The tub backed up and the maid never cleaned the bath room good. The tub had a ring around it and the beds were not made. The view from the top floor was great, you saw the water and the kids loved it. The breakfast was ok. The front desk staff were helpful and nice. Would we stay again, no. I would go somewere else.

<Content>Budget hotel, clean, friendly and free continental breakfast Knew the hotel was old so there was no surprise. However, when we arrived the elevator was being renovated, which meant a walk up to our room on third floor, sun deck and gym on 7. Rooms are large and clean with small fridge and micro. The staff was extremely helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations. A free continental breakfast buffet was served every morning in the restaurant (currently only open for breakfast). Hilton hotel is a 10 minute walk, casino 15 minutes, 45 minute walk to Old San Juan. You can catch a bus in either direction in front of hotel for 75 cents. This is not a luxury hotel, no room service, pool or beach. However, if looking to save some money it's the place to stay. Keep in mind, your view could be a vacant building or car lot. We had a good time. Take a bus to Marriott if you want to sit by the pool. P.S. We got an extreme bargain on this hotel. If we had paid full price we may have been more critical.

<Content>Will not be a repeat customer! Having read the reviews on this site I knew not to expect much. But I got less than my lowest expectations. Although the rooms are clean and seem in good repair, we kept running out of hot water. The elevator is estremely slow and you are better off climbing the stairs. There is no swimming pool. I received a call from the Hotel owner demanding more money because we had four people in the room, supposedly there is an additional fee after the first two people. Nothing was mentioned during check in and he called me at 10:30pm. When leaving the room for the day you have to leave the room key with the front desk and request it when you come back.

<Content>Needs improvements in logistics and services We had a group of 24 people taking a cruise out of San Juan. The day before our arrival we had confirmation papers and confirmation from some employee from the Mirimar that we had reservations. After our group was dropped off at the front desk, we were told that only 4 of the 24 had rooms. The remaining 20 were shipped to a sister hotel were they had trouble setting us up for the night. We did not meet our remaining group of 4 until the next day. Our rooms were less than desireable. We shared one wash cloth and the water stopped periodically during use. The rooms did not smell fresh. Word to the wise, stay with a well named hotel chain.

<Content>Well, well I stayed there a few times, mainly because I was once on a low budget and the other times because I knew where it was...One could compair it with a low-budget Days-Inn. The staff is indeed friendly (but everybody is in PR). It is in a resident area, very lonely at nights. I did not see any restaurants and these beautiful rooms must have been on another floor. It smelled indeed wet, but many hotels do in hot regions.I always, check the fire excapes and when I did, I found a man eating a chicken in the garbage behind the hotel. The chicken was covered in flies but he did not seem to mind. I am sorry but just had to mention this. There are much nicer hotels in PR, but nice for the person whom like to feel the locals and discover these things.

<Content>Not as Advertized We needed a hotel for an overnight stay before an early flight. I did a lot of internet searching for a hotel not too far from the airport and not too far from Old San Juan. The Hotel Miramar filled that request. But any other similarity to descriptions posted on the website ended there. Our rooms were tiny with no frig, no microwaves, no desks--there wouldn't have been room for one. I don't know where they got the picture of the common room because it doesn't look anything like the picture. It is small, dark and shabby. The bar and restaurant were not open any of the time we were there. The hotel is located on a very, very busy street and the noise from cars and sirens was deafening. It must be on the Saturday night cruise route for young adults! Totally jammed with constant honking. Not a peaceful place for someone who had to get up at 5:00 AM. However, the staff was great. They were extremely helpful. The rooms were clean if a bit worn out. We would not stay here again but would definitely return to San Juan. It was a fascinating place.

<Content>SMALL STEP ABOVE MOTEL 6 Definitely not the place to book if you are looking for a beach getaway or a clean place to stay. Although located very close to a supermarket and a movie theater, there's not much to do in the immediate vicinity. What's worse is that it didn't feel very safe to walk around the area even during the daylight hours. The only consolation is the rooftop sundeck. It's definitely a small step above a motel room. The rooms were not very clean and the bed sheets were thread bare.

<Content>Best bargain for your buck! I visited PR twice in 2005. The first time in May on business, and then in June. On the second visit, I stayed at Hotel Miramar with my girlfriend for 4 days. For all the folks who really hated the Mirimar, I really think it's because they had super high expectations...I mean for the relatively inexpensive hotel fee, it was damn good. If you expect the luxury standards of the Condado hotels, you might not want to stay here. If you're into being pampered, do not stay here. My girlfriend who is PR born hadn't been there since she was a child, and I was exploring PR again for fun this time. We found The Hotel Miramar to be very cozy and the staff to be very friendly. Yes there were kinks...the parking, a lil busy (but have a car or suffer the consequences: you'll have to brave a highway and lagoon to get to the beach w/out one)The phone in the room wasn't working but we had our cell phones so that was fine. For hotel staff we used the phone in the hall.We wanted to vacation as locals and seriously we were treated as such. We drove out to Condado where the beaches were glorious even in the midst of hurricane season. (When it rains, it only lasts for like 10 minutes then it's back to sunshine)Having a car is sound bet...we drove out to many of the local area towns just exits away visiting malls, Old San Juan, and more. We then would head back to Miramar. It was like coming back home. We shopped at the supermarket which was like a block away, ordered food from the restaurant across the street, got nicknacks from the 24hr Walgreens. We washed clothes in the washer. We talked on the terrace as we sipped mixed drinks which we shared with other hotels guests in the evening. The night air was calming and the views serene. It was a fantastic experience.A hotel is a hotel, but it is how you perceive the experience. We went in with great perceptions and were rewarded in return. Definitely recommended.

<Content>Book Elsewhere I didn't expect a luxurious hotel, but what I got was disappointing. The staff was friendly, but that's where the good things end. Forget the bar, restaurant and continental breakfast -- they don't exist. The maintenence man is elusive; I had to fix my own refrigerator and the hotel's one elevator sometimes doesn't work. The neighborhood is quite run-down, although the hotel's employees say it is safe. I had my doubts. I would not stay there again.

<Content>Comfortable, Clean, Fine, and Friendly I just returned from staying at the Hotel Miramar. The rooms are large and very clean. Each has a fridge and counter space. The commplimentary breakfast was excellent (eggs, ham, juice, coffee, toast). The front desk help were superb: friendly, efficient - the best. The bus stop for the 25 cent bus ride to old San Juan is one block away. The rooftop sun deck offers great views of the ocean and San Juan. The neighborhood is what I would call faded grandeur. It looks like it is trying to make a comeback.My only complaint is that it is not blocks to the ocean. Well, maybe it is, but you CANNOT walk there. The hotel is surrounded by highways.Not, it's not the Intercontinental, but for the price and the location, it's excellent.

<Content>Never Again!! Immediately upon arrival was told by desk staff that the hotel would loose water supply next morning due to city water main repairs, but not to worry because back-up water tanks/pumps would provide all nonpotable water and drinking water would be availabe at desk. Next morning awoke to discover hotel had NO water for toilets or showers due to back-up pump failure. They forgot to test the pumps! Had to wait until we boarded the cruise ship to take a shower. Our room faced a busy street and all hours night club so we got very little sleep due to nonstop traffic and outdoor partying across the street. No working lights in the bathroom and I was forced to change the burned-out lightbulbs because the bldg custodian had gone home for the day and the desk staff could not leave the desk unattended. Hotel restaurant was actually pretty good.

<Content>Would NOT recommend I am by NO means picky and was thrilled to see Good reviews before making my reservation here. I am extremely well traveled - traveling all over the world and usually travel 5 - 6 times/year. I would never recommned this hotel. We stayed here as a post-cruise stay with family for one night. Elevator was ricketly, and when got to our floor it was about 7 inches off!! we had to walk UP just to get out of the elevator. The room was smelly, old, in much need of updating/repair. We didn't even unpack - said no way went right back downstairs to request something else. Staff could not accommodate. We took a loss on our pre-paid rate of $140/nt and stayed at the Embassy Suites instead as they were the only ones besides the Marriott that had rooms left (we ate the $260/nt room rate and chalked it up as 'experience').A much more suitable hotel would be the HI Express or the Comfort Inn  Suites. Caveat - do not rely on the pictures you see on Expedia.com off this site, nor should you do that with any site. Our travel agent had advised us that she had not personally stayed at this hotel and was 'hesitant' at booking it for us, but it was a decent price so we grabbed. Next time....we will heed our agent's advise.Hope this helps you with your decision!Donna

<Content>Comfortable, if you don't expect luxury We stayed at the Hotel Miramar in San Juan, PR, for a week in January, 2005. We had booked online for about $140/night (if I remember correctly; Jan. is the height of the tourist season there.) The hotel is not really near the ocean (perhaps 8 to 10 blocks to a public beach, a determined pedestrian can do it), and development has largely blocked its once ocean view. (The neighborhood is named Miramar.) Everything was fine, altho our window air conditioner needed to be replaced after the first night. The fan was making a loud noise. It was replaced the next day with a brand new unit that worked without problem. This is not a new or deluxe hotel. It is an older building that is family owned and operated. One can see an honest effort to keep things in good repair. The neighborhood may look run down now; but was once a rather up-scale, residential area. Generally it is quite safe, even after dark. Someone wrote in an earlier review, that their bathroom shower curtain had mold growing on it. My experience is that a bit of mold will grow in a single day in the tropics if the plastic shower curtain is left with folds not separated for air drying. Included is a free continental breakfast with cereal, orange juice, milk, coffee, toast, bagels, and small danish sweet rolls. A hot breakfast (eggs and a meat selection) is available for a few dollars each, if desired. Each room has a small refrigerator and at least a cooktop. Some units have ovens ... great if you want to reheat a pizza. (Although we had been told all rooms had microwave ovens, our room with a conventional oven did not.) Restaurants (like Domino's and Subway, nothing deluxe) and a supermarket (opens early; closes at 7PM, 5PM on Sundays) are within a block. A 3-screen theatre is almost next door. Bus stop is almost in front of the hotel. If driving, how to reach the hotel is not obvious, due to the 1-way frontage road in front of the hotel. (At the corner stop light near the hotel, turn South [left] off of Ponce de Leon, go to the top of the hill, but not further, turn right into a small lane, and turn right again at the end of the lane and follow the road around to the hotel.) Limited off-street parking is available behind and beside the hotel. The hotel staff needs your car keys to shuffle cars that are parked-in at any one time. To get to the hotel from the airport, go west on highway 26 (Baldorioty de Castro; 6 lanes total) towards San Juan, exit right at De Diego (highway 37) and turn left onto the overpass over 26, in a few blocks you will come to a T with stop light where you MUST turn right onto Ponce de Leon. (PdL is one-way with the leftmost lane for buses only in the OPPOSITE direction.) Continue about a mile further to the last stop light on Ponce de Leon, then follow earlier directions. If you should pass the last stop light, take the next right onto 26 back towards the airport, then take the first exit right (Miramar exit), and then the second right off of the ramp/frontage road to go back to Ponce de Leon for another try. In summary, if you are looking for a decent, economical hotel for touring the San Juan area, the Miramar is a good bet. We also saw a lot of folks over-nighting to catch their cruise ship the next day. A taxi stand to Old San Juan and the cruise docks is right next to the hotel.

<Content>Comfortable and fine We found this hotel to be perfect for our first night stay in San Juan before leaving for Viequez. The staff were very nice, the room was quite large, clean and comfortable.We felt very safe walking in the neighborhood.We happened to be within a block of a very good restaurant for dinner - Cafe de Paris too. What more could you ask for?!!

<Content>Enjoyable atmosphere I would stay again. The staff also found us a rental van when no one else could! We traveled with a group of students in January, 2004 to San Juan. This was a good hotel for a small group. Fairly convenient to major attractions. The Sanchez' and their staff were excellent and very accommodating. Running an older resort myself, I understand the labor of love they have put into the Miramar. Sincerely, Glenn Jorgenson

<Content>Nice for a family Well, i stayed there with my husband and children.When we got there the clerk was friendly and warm. The room was clean, and i liked the idea there was a kitchen which was also clean. now as for the utensils...they had to be cleaned a little.the safe in our room worked, so did the fridge.Any questions i had, they made me feel comfortable to ask. This hotel is very quiet and comfortable. there is a supermarket up the block, movie theater ,too.The bus is across the street which is good to take to the beach, and it only cost $.50. Now i must be honest, the continental breakfast was nice, but i do think they should have warm breakfast as part of that menu. You can buy warm breakfast for about 3 bucks...which is still good. But when you pay for a week...i think meals should be part of your stay. They roof terrace was nice , especially at night. I would recommend Miramar for someone who wants a peaceful stay with no noise. i enjoyed my stay and i would come again.

<Content>Nice Local Hotel My sister and I stayed at the Hotel Miramar from 26-29 JUL 04. And, as has been my experience with most hotel reviews, there was more good than the bad written by other reviewers! We lived in San Juan many years ago, so this was a trip of rediscovery. We knew the area, and the local customs. Yes, it is an older property in a residential neighborhood. But, it's quaint and has lots of local charm. It's also in a safe neighborhood that is close to bus stops and access to the Condado beach area. The staff made us feel welcome and always greeted us with a smile. They provided excellent recommendations for local food and tours. They booked the rainforest/beach tour for us and arranged for pickup right at the door. This tour was one of the best I have taken--well planned, tour guide was friendly, from San Juan, and very knowledgeable. Our room was adequate, clean and well maintained daily by the maids. We didn't pay for, nor expect, an upscale property with mega amenities. What we received were warm, charming, local folks who took pride in being from Puerto Rico. I'd recommend the Mirimar to anyone who is budget-minded and enjoys the local flavor more than the cookie-cutter tourist entrapments!

<Content>We didn't like the neighborhood We had our reservations from June 26th to July 3rd. We liked what their website said about the location, one of the best neighborhoods. Well when we arrived and got there we didn't like the surroundings. The building next door looked like it was in ruins, the same with many buildings. Maybe it is really safe, but the Miramar neighborhood scared us, all that neighborhood is in that condition. We didn't like the way it looked at night. The hotel room had a moist odor. The kitchenette looked too old. The parking lot was very small. The front desk clerk was nice though.My husband said he was not going to stay there. So we went to an internet cafe which was in El Condado area to look for a hotel availability in a website and we didn't find anything at our price range. The cheapest hotel we found was a very expensive two star hotel. So we asked the internet cafe clerk and she adviced us to check the hotel around the corner which was the Diamond Palace Hotel. There was room for the next day and the following days, and cheaper. So we got a better hotel at a better location with better amenities for less money. My advice is for you to stay in El Condado area because it is really better than Isla Verde: it is a very good neighborhood and the hotels are much cheaper, it's nicer for me, you can access any part of the island with less traffic. The beach is marginally better in Isla Verde. Check the rest of the reviews of this website to choose a hotel.
