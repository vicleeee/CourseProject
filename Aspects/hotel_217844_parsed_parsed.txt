<Content>Excellent Hotel Excellent small hotel. Large rooms, large bathroom, very clean, very comfortable. The room and bathroom are just as they appear in the TripAdvisor traveler pictures. The location is also excellent--two blocks north of Union Square, about halfway up Nob Hill. We used BART from the airport to Powell Street and walked 6-8 blocks to the hotel with small rolling cases (the last block is a bit of a climb). On departure with a 6 am flight, the hotel booked a car to the airport for us. All positives, no negatives about the Orchard, and we got a terrific deal through hotels.com.

<Content>Another great experience! This is the second time I've stayed at The Orchard Hotel for business in the past 6 months, and it's been consistently great. The rooms are bigger than most in SF and very quiet, which I really appreciate. The staff is very helpful and friendly, and the valet service is quick and convenient. I'll be staying here again soon!

<Content>Peaceful time at The Orchard My girlfriend and I stayed for almost a week at the Orchard and had a fantastic time! The staff was friendly, the rooms were well-furnished with very comfortable beds and the restaurant made a tasty burger. Additionally, the hotel is centrally located - easy walking or taxi distance to anywhere you want to go in the city and there are plenty of hotspots nearby to stumble home from. Wireless internet was included with the room  the staff made sure we had a steady supply of clean wine glasses. An easy standout!

<Content>Great hotel! Great hotel, centrally located near Union Square, Nob Hill and Chinatown. Your walking distance from almost everything. The hotel is clean, quiet and the staff are very friendly and curteous. We booked an internet AAA rate of $99 + $40 for parking. For the money, you can't beat it. The TVs even have surround sound and you can choose from a large selection of DVDs at the fron t desk. This is a great find for San Francisco.

<Content>Nice Surprise Stayed 3 nights- 12/29-12/31. Very good experience. Rooms are average size for a city hotel, but very comfortable. Big bathroom! Staff were very professional, friendly, helpful. Good location in city center. Thought it might be noisy as room was right over Bush Street, but modern windows and traffic disappears at night so room was very quiet. Definitely would stay there again.

<Content>Great Stay! We booked a room through Quikbook, got a great rate and nice stay.The beds are comfortable, the room is a decent size, the bathroom is large. There is a daily paper and lots of tourist info. Take advantage of the DVD library - a good selection. There are numerous cafes within walking distance. Very close to Union Square, but far away enough for some quiet. Staff was helpful and there is a computer for public use at the front desk. The housekeeping staff did a nice job. Keep in mind - there is a need for some paint in the hallways and and room doorways. Looks like the wear and tear of luggage.We used BART for our trips to and from the airport. If you can handle walking up the hill to the hotel, taking public transportation is convenient and inexpensive.

<Content>Great hotel My wife and I took our two adult children on a trip to reward them for completing tertiary studies and San Francisco was everyone's favourite place. This hotel added to our enjoyment of the city mostly because of its location. It's close to restaurants, shops and transport. The rooms are well furnished and quiet. There is a very nice bar and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>A fine little spot to stay We came to San Francisco for a pre-Christmas visit with our two teens. We booked the Orchard because of the reviews, the location and a great deal on Hotels.com.Four nights in two rooms -- one King room connecting to 2 Twins. As requested we had connecting rooms and an upper floor. Our rooms were also ready when we checked in around 11:00 a.m. which was much appreciated. Rooms are nicely sized as are the baths. We had nice views facing Bush street and heard only the occasional siren... no sound from other rooms, other than housekeepers in the hallways. Cleaning and turndown were always done while we were out -- nice timing. Everything was clean and linens were good.The lobby is drab, and small - a real turn-off for all of us, and the dining room, while nicely decorated, seemed to have a limited menu and very slow staff (friendly tho'). We ate breakfast there once and chose not to return.The location if terrific for everything -- hikes to Grace Cathedral for the holiday lights, Powell Street Cable Cars, Union Square, great small restaurants, Chinatown -- everything.... We would recommend and would consider returning.... but we also like to try new places :).

<Content>Great bargain in the heart of San Francisco I searched the internet for a quality hotel that was reasonably priced and I found exactly what I was looking for in The Orchard Hotel. If you are looking for an attractive, clean, comfortable room and don't want to feel like you overpaid than you should consider The Orchard Hotel. I was so pleased with the entire experience that I feel comfortable recommending this Hotel to anyone. I would definitely stay at The Orchard again the next time I'm in San Francisco.The Orchard Hotel is a very nice hotel, a real bargain in the heart of San Francisco. You know how they say you get what you pay for? Well at The Orchard Hotel you get more than you pay for.P.S. I stayed at the J.W. Marriott the last time I was in San Francisco and wasn't impressed except with the size of the bill. The room at the Marriott had a few broken bathroom fixtures, terrible water pressure in the shower and the restaurant was ridiculously expensive for ridiculously small portions. I do not enjoy gargantuan size food portions but I do expect a meal to at least make me feel like I just ate something. We were all still hungry after our lunch. I would never stay at the J.W. Marriott (Post  Mason) again.

<Content>Great place, great people! After much research and reading a lot of past customers reviews, I booked the Orchard Hotel because I did not want to stay in another chain hotel. We have traveled to Europe quite a bit and the hotel entrance immediately gave us a European feel. The rooms were very spacious, beds were comfortable and the large bathroom was a plus. The staff at the hotel is excellent. They are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is very close to anything. you can walk to almost anywhere from there, We would highly recommend you give it a try. Should we ever return to the area, we will most likely stay there again.

<Content>My favorite SF hotel This is my favorite San Francisco hotel. The rooms are small but pleasantly designed, the bed and pillows are super comfy, the wi-fi is free, and the bathroom is large and has everything you need. It's located close enough to Moscone to walk if you are a reasonably energetic person, and far enough away to be a fair amount cheaper than the hotels in the immediate vicinity.

<Content>Loved the Hotel - Perfect for us This hotel was absolutely perfect for us. The location was great (we wanted to be near all the touristy stuff, but out of the Tenderloin), the staff were helpful and warm, and the bed, oh the bed was so incredibly huge and comfy! The room (street side, 8th floor) was surprisingly quiet. Occasionally we could hear a tiny clang clang of the cable car, and that's it! No neighbour noise either. There was a wonderful brochure listing all sorts of green places, and the products were all organic and nice (even if the shampoo didn't do the greatest job, it smelled great). The fridge was packed, though we didn't use anything there (we used it for storing our own water and drinks). I really can't say enough about this hotel - we will stay there again for sure!!

<Content>Loved it......... Fantastic hotel. Arrived at the start of October. The hotel is in a perfect location. This was the last hotel we stayed in over a four week trip and was almost certainly the best. Cable car is just on the corner and Union Square one block away. The hotel is really clean, very well presented and the rooms are spacious. Staff were very polite and helpful. Would happily book here again if I returned to SF. Not particularly cheap, but we got a good deal via Hotels.com and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. Well worth the money.

<Content>Loved it We are from holland and stayed here for 6 nights. We loved everything about it. The room, the staf and the location. Just a few meters away from the cabel car stop (buy a ticket for three days, and you can use all muni transportation, incl. cable car, for 18USD).To union square and chinatown only five minute walk. Free wifi in the room. If we ever have to stay in San Francisco again, we definitly book this hotel again.

<Content>Clean and Quiet Union Square Hotel This place is a good find, near Union Square. Just off Powell Street, The Orchard is quiet while being in the middle of Union Square excitement. Powell Street cable stop is steps away. Get the multiday cable car/bus pass at Walgreens a block away. My only complaint is with the in-room single cup coffee maker. It makes a single very weak cup of coffee and you only get one reg and one decaf pod.

<Content>Great location, great hotel This is a fantastic little hotel in a great location - right at Powell and Bush. Easy walk to virtually everything, right on the cable car line. The rooms are very large, very quiet and well appointed. The bathrooms are huge. There is free wifi, a small workout room and a DVD player in each room with free movies in the lobby. Recommend very highly.

<Content>Solid stay at Orchard We booked the Orchard Hotel based on three things; positive Trip Advisor Reviews, price, and location. Overall it was worth it. We were early for checkin by a couple hours and our Deluxe King Room wasn't ready so they upgraded us to a suite, so we were off to a very good start! The suite was superb, very spacious and very nice. Overall we thought the reception service was excellent, doormen were top drawer, location was great, and noise from adjacent rooms and street was nil. We did not eat at their restaurant, but were in the lounge for a few hours one evening with mediocre service. We agree with prior reviews that this hotel is not exactly boutique, as it is more of a simple and efficient medium to high end hotel with a great location just a couple blocks from Union Square and on the Cable Car route. This was our second trip to San Fran and this hotel was much better than the one we stayed at before, in a similar location for about the same price.

<Content>Just average An average hotel, I can't see why it is rated no 3 in San Francisco. It does have good size rooms, good location  some of the doorman are friendly  helpful. But the decor is tired  the breakfast isn't worth it. Pay for room only  eat your breakfast somewhere else. Also found that you had to ask for coffee at breakfast, it was never offered. Some people describe this hotel as a Boutique hotel, it isn't. It's not modern enough  no thought has gone into the decor.If you stay here you will neither be impressed or annoyed, as I've already said it's just an average hotel and you can pay less for an average hotel.

<Content>Highly recommend Searched for a hotel in our price range in the city and went with this recommendation from a friend. We were pleased with our stay in every respect. No troubles with reservation made through Expedia -- in fact, they confirmed; I did not need to. Staff were service oriented and friendly. Room was large, comfy, clean, great bathroom. Exceeded expectations. No noise and easy valet parking. A great stay!

<Content>Great Boutique Hotel The reviews I read were so good I had to see for myself. The Orchard reminds me of the top notch European boutique hotels I prefer when in Europe. The hotel is near the Powell street cable car, which is convenient; however, we thought it would be noisy. The room also faced Bush Street, and again we thought it would be noisy. Surprise, with the double glaze windows the room was plenty quiet. I would like to discourage people from going there, so that the prices don't go up and so that I won't have a problem getting a room next time I am overnight in SF; but in good conscience, I can't do that. The Orchard is a great boutique hotel.

<Content>Orchard --a Tale of Two Hotels The Orchard Hotel has two locations--one at the top of the hill on Bush street, the other at the bottom. There are distinct differences between the two properties. The hotel at the bottom of the hill is new and has good amenities, such as a computer room and a gym. The hotel at the top of hill is older and has one computer at the front desk and a gym with broken equipment. Further, the older property tends to be noiser, though the rooms tend to be larger. Our experience was extremely mixed. Some staff were extremely cooperative and proactive if there were any questions or concerns, others were not. Do not want to say that this was a thoroughly unpleasant experience, but a lot of improvement is needed for the Orchard to truly be considered a strong property.

<Content>Still the San Francisco Favorite It has been about four years since I've traveled to San Francisco for business. I was so pleased to return to the Orchard Hotel and find the same great rooms and friendly staff. The restaurant has changed slightly and though they no longer offer free breakfast, the Steele cut oatmeal was delicious. For a downtown hotel, the bathrooms are super spacious and the beds are filled with comfortable down pillows that make for a great night's sleep.The location right off Powell Street is very convenient for getting around the city. I will continue to make this my first choice hotel for visiting San Francisco.

<Content>Excellent Hotel This was our first visit to SF and we booked online. We stayed there primarily because they advertised they were a green hotel. We were very happy with our accomodations. They upgraded us to a suite because the room we wanted was no longer available, at no extra charge. The room was very clean and neat. The bed was very comfy. The service was excellent. I would stay there again and recommend it to anyone staying in SF. By the way, the cable car stop is right at the corner!

<Content>Best Hotel in San Francisco The Orchard Hotel is a small boutique hotel at the corner of Bush and Powell.It is a great place to stay whether on business or pleasure. The staff is very pleasant and helpful. Daffodil鈥檚 serves a fresh healthy California cuisine with delightful service. I entertained clients at Daffodil鈥檚 and they were very impressed.The rooms are large for the San Francisco Market and were very comfortable; beds and pillows were terrific.This was my first stay but will not be my last.Thanks you to all that made my stay so pleasant.

<Content>Worth its place at the top of the ratings We chose this hotel for a 7-night stay October 14-21, on the strength of its high rating on this site and the reviews. We were certainly not disappointed! Staff were friendly, right from the initial welcome, and able to advise on things like what bus to catch to the Golden Gate bridge. The requests we made at the time of booking were met.Location - near the intersection of Bush  Powell Streets, convenient for Union Square shops, cable cars, Chinatown, and easy to get to just about everywhere else. A safe area, with enough places to eat nearby.Facilities - a moderately sized hotel, with 10 floors but only about 12 rooms on each floor. Elevators always arrived promptly. Ice machines are on every third floor, but hidden away behind doors so you may need to ask at reception where they are. There is a laptop at reception for customer use, useful for checking emails, checking in for return flights, etc.Room - the hotel met our request for a high floor and there was no external or internal noise. Also the room did not face onto the street. A good size room with plenty of places to put things. A very comfortable king size bed. Air conditioning was quiet and could be adjusted for the desired temperature. En-suite bathroom with bath/shower - not a big bath but I hate it when a hotel only offers you a shower! The worst thing I can say about the room is that the plug in the washbasin allowed water to slowly trickle out.Breakfast - choice of a la carte or buffet. The buffet selection was rather limited (only one type of meat, for example) and the price was much the same as for a la carte so we went for the menu choice. I recommend the salmon. Typical cost 15-20 dollars.Dinner - we only ate in on the first night, preferring to sample what was on offer in the area. Good, but not a wide menu selection.Price - we booked through Expedia who were doing a special room rate of 143.30 UK pounds per night including all taxes etc, but excluding breakfast. Certainly worth it at this price. That was back in the summer when you got 2 dollars to the pound - happy days!Conclusion - would we choose this hotel again if we returned to San Francisco? Definitely we would - at the right price!Eating out tip - try the various European cuisines in Belden Place, which connects Bush St and Pine St (between Kearny  Montgomery). Plenty of choice, plus the chance to eat out of doors (with heaters when it gets a bit chilly), and you might even end up talking to your neighbour! Oh, and this city certainly takes its wine seriously, with just about everywhere offering a wide range of Californian and other wines.Transport tip - a MUNI passport covers buses and cable cars and is good value, especially if you intend to ride the cable cars a lot as they cost 5 dollars a time otherwise. 1-day  3-day passports can be bought at Walgreen's about a block from the hotel towards Union Square. For a 7-day passport costing 24 dollars go to the booth that sells theatre tickets on Union Square.

<Content>Prefect! The Orchard has had some pretty good reviews on Tripadvisor and deservedly so . A very pleasant place to stay right in the centre of Downtown San Francisco.Excellent check in - very friendly and quick. The room (more likea suite) was excellent - large living area and completely separate large bedroom (with door to shut yourself off completely). Very spacious, well appointed and clean bathroom. Right next to the elevator - usually a sign of a noisy night. Not here - didn't hear a thing all the time I was there.Didn't take my laptop but there's one in the lobby you can use for free.

<Content>Great hotel in excellent location This is a great hotel in a perfect location near Union Square.It has no pretentions of glamour, but the room was spacious, very quiet (no street noise at all) and the king size bed was the most comfortable we have ever slept in. The bathroom was well appointed and roomy.All the Orchard staff were friendly and helpfulStrongly recommended.

<Content>Lovely hotel, right in the heart of San Fran We decided to end our 2 week Californian honeymoon with 6 nights in San Francisco. After reading the good reviews of the Orchard we booked via Expedia and got a really good rate. First impression of the hotel was really good, the staff on reception were very welcoming, gave us maps and guides and explained where the cable car stop was and where the hotel was located. They couldn't have been more helpful.Our room was spacious and clean with an enormous bed and large bathroom. It was also quiet apart from the odd cable car bell. We were particularly impressed with the free wifi from the laptop on reception and the free DVD hire - something we welcomed after a day's sightseeing.The hotel is 5 mins walk downhill to Union Sq and the main shops. It is also on the cable car stop of Powell and Bush which was ideal for exploring San Fran. However we walked from the hotel along the Embarcadero and down to Fisherman's Wharf as the queues for cable cars were really long. We were there during Fleet Week so it was very busy. All in all, the hotel is in an ideal location for both sightseeing, shopping and generally exploring San Fran. We couldn't fault the service at the hotel and all staff were extremely friendly. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Loved it! My Wife and I stayed for 5 nights at the Orchard and found it great value for money: very spacious, clean rooms with all the amenities. Superbly located in the heart of SF. It was a bargain too since we found an early rate through Hotels.com (but I recommend to ALWAYS check if the rate in the hotel website are same or better than Hotels.com, and if you do book through Hotels.com, to call the hotel 2 weeks before arival to make sure they got the reservation etc).Only tip is to ask for upper floors (street noise could trouble). Highly Recommended!

<Content>Th Orchard Hotel is first rate for service and quality I stayed at the Orchard for the JavaOne conference. The hotel was recommended to me by a colleague who stayed there for a previous JavaOne event. I am very glad that I took his recommendation. My stay was absolutely first class. The service was excellent, right from the very first moment I was welcomed. The room was clean and spacious, with every facility you could want. I plan to go to JavaOne next year and intend to stay there again, it was so good. My room was well serviced and the staff were always very helpful and polite.The location was quite a distance from the conference but I didn't mind. The restaurant is IMO a bit overpriced so I had only one meal there. But it was very good with very good service.It was not a cheap stay but I intend to go again because it was such a good stay, so I think it does offer good value for money.

<Content>Cool on The Orchard The Orchard is beautifully located near the corner of Powell and Bush and with easy access to the cable car. The rooms were clean, comfortable and well serviced. However it appears to be some time since the rooms were redecorated. Reception staff were friendly and helpful and the availability of fresh fruit at the reception counter was welcome.However the included buffett breakfast was boring, with little choice. Furthermore it is difficult to understand if the breakfast is included in the room tariff and is a buffett (ie serve yourself) why the floor staff insist on advising you that a tip is expected.Overall the Orchard represents poor value and at the tariff paid I think better value can be had elsewhere

<Content>What a little gem.... I am in the business ( licensed sightseeing guide, NYC) and a friend and business associate who is a travel agent in Massachusetts booked this trip for us, coming in 3 days early for a 10 day cruise on the Star Princess out of San Francisco.Loved this little hotel, reminded me of some I stayed in inEurope. Very clean and quiet and right off the Powell  Hydecable car line on the corner. Great location; nice people. Very comfortable bed, etc. and elegant understated furnishings.Would be happy to come back.

<Content>A Perfect Weekend We arrived from the east coast at 9:30 a.m. on a busy marathon weekend expecting to be turned away until the afternoon. Not only did the staff invite us to check into our room immediately, they upgraded us to a suite free of charge. The rooms were spacious and clean, the bathroom was huge, the bed was comfortable and the hotel was quiet with just the muffled sound of the cable car bells every once in a while. The Orchard is in the heart of the city, close to the best shopping and dining, yet it feels private and calm. The staff was wonderful at anticipating our every need (box breakfasts were available for race participants, choice of several newspapers, turn-down service with chocolates, free fruit) and could not have been nicer every time we passed through the lobby. After the race, we were allowed a late check-out (2:00) and since our flight didn't leave until 10 p.m., the hotel desk people locked up our bags, printed our boarding passes, and then had a town car waiting for us to go to the airport (for the same price as a taxi). We will definitely stay here again. The suite was plenty big enough for a couple of kids too if you're traveling with family. This was one of those rare weekends when everything just seemed to be going our way and the Orchard played a big part in making it special. The employees really seem to like their jobs and know how to make guests feel welcome.

<Content>Another Outstanding Stay at the O! Just had my annual stay at the Orchard, and as usual, it was an oasis of calm and comfort in the midst of a chaotic business trip. I would not stay at another hotel in San Francisco--the value at the Orchard cannot be beat. The rooms are a nice size compared to many boutique hotels in the area, with quite a large bathroom--plenty of counterspace for a lady to spread out her necessities! The down comforter, crisp linens, and fluffy pile of pillows make for a wonderful night's sleep, as does the individually-controlled air conditioning--another item missing from many SF hotels in this range of quality. Lovely robes, nice toiletries, and plenty of room to pack away your things all add up to an incredibly comfortable stay.Free internet adds to the allure, as does the excellent room service provided by the restaurant downstairs. Food is really good and always arrives promptly and at the right temperature--best of all, The O is thoughtful in providing the appropriate condiments and utensils--things you may not have thought about yourself! The daily maid service is unobtrusive and consistent--I have never failed to have exactly what I need or requested provided promptly. And best of all, the service and attitude of the staff are just amazing. They respond with friendly professionalism and never fail to offer a smile along with their excellent service! And all of this at an excellent value in a truly convenient location. What more could you ask for?I highly recommend this hotel to people who want to feel comfortable and welcomed and prefer a quiet, traditional-style hotel to the newer hip hotels full of sleek, minimalist decor. The Orchard is, admittedly, showing a wee bit of wear, but like the grand dame she is, her put-you-at-ease personality is like your favorite aging aunt--you love her all the more for her little cosmetic flaws. Everything is spotlessly clean and fresh, and all you will find are a few worn spots on the edges of furniture or carpet--certainly nothing that will spoil the experience.I won't stay anywhere else in San Francisco. The Orchard Hotel is my home away from home, and I wish there was one in every city!

<Content>Great hotel in a central SF location! My partner and I stayed in the Orchard Hotel for our first visit to San Francisco. Having read the reviews on TripAdvisor we decided to go ahead and book for 7 nights direct on their website.After reading in a TimeOut guidebook that if possible you should get a suite we contacted the hotel about this and although we didn't want to pay to upgrade, they were kind enough to put us as requesting an upgrade if one was available at check-in. To our joy we found out on arrival they had put us into a king suite for free!The room was great, we had views out onto Bush street and down to the financial district, a separate living room to the bedroom and a wonderful bathroom with both a good size bath and a large shower cubical. My only criticism of the room is that I was expecting a more modern look to the rooms, although the d茅cor was not to my personal opinion of a boutique hotel it was still new, clean and comfortable.We had 2 televisions in the room (one in the bedroom and one the living room) although these were old CRT screens when I would have expected flatscreen technology. The living room also had a DVD player with a library of DVDs available from the front desk. Free wi-fi was also included in the stay, which came in very handy with checking back home and when booking some tickets during our stay.On our first evening we used the room service to eat as we were a bit worn out from flying, and the food was very good - I can highly recommend the risotto!Overall this is a great hotel, the staff were very helpful when we needed them and were always available to offer information or to book a towncar/taxi to various locations and back to the airport.

<Content>A comfortable Hotel in a reasonable Location A comfortable Hotel it a good LocationThe hotel is in very good condition and the rooms are generous in size and well appointed. While not a new hotel it is in very good condition relative to its age. We enjoyed our one night stay and it was a very quiet and relaxed stay. Location is good being within walking distance of downtown and Union Square and very close to the tram line. A good option

<Content>Great place to stay My wife and I just returned from a long week-end stay at the Orchard. We chose the Orchard because of the reviews and rating on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. For the price, the location is great and the rooms are very clean and comfortable. The cable car is just at the corner and the bus stop to the Fisherman's Wharf is a five minutes walk. We had rented a vehicle but hardly used it since parking is expensive and hard to find. We used Valet parking for $40 a day. We were traveling somewhere else after San Francisco and needed a car, otherwise you don't need it if you're just staying in San Francisco. The transit system is very good.There is a very good cafe just around the corner and a good pizza parlor just across the street if you don't mind the wait (long lineup). Union Square is also very closeby for shopping.The hotel provides a nice collection of DVD's to watch in your room and a wireless connection (Wi-Fi). If you don't have your laptop, there is a complimentary computer in the lobby to surf the internet or check e-mails.Although very friendly, the staff were not very helpful with the local attractions info and not very good at recommending restaurants.

<Content>Great location and service for 20 year anniversary I am so glad I read previous Trip Advisor reviews. That is the reason why I booked this hotel for our stay. It definitely lived up to it's praise. We happened to be traveling for our 20th wedding anniversary and were looking for different hotels for each night of our trip. The Orchard definitely met our needs. When we got to the front desk they had bumped us up to a suite which was huge and luxurious. That was definitely a nice bonus. The location of the hotel was perfect for walking to shops and restaurants. It was also so close to the cable cars that it was an easy hop on and off. We did rely on the staff to recommend lunch and dinner spots. It worked out well. The only negative was the work out room. It really is just one of the regular hotel rooms that they placed a bike and treadmill in. The TV did not work and there were no lights in the room. Other than that, it was perfect and I would definitely recommend for your stay.

<Content>Great Place We stayed at this hotel for the first two nights of our honeymoon (they didn't even know this and we got upgraded to a suite - lucky us!). It is a perfect location for discovering the city, with quiet rooms, a great European-style breakfast in the morning, and friendly staff. Simple, but modern and tasteful decor in the rooms - and most importantly, clean! If you have a car, park it at the nearby public Stockton/Sutter garage a block and a half away - it's much cheaper than using the valet. We booked this hotel based on the TripAdvisor recommendation, and we were not disappointed.

<Content>Great Locations We chose the Orchard because of the reviews and rating on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. For the price, the location is great and the rooms have clearly been updated and the beds are extremely comfortable.However, our room was clearly a small one, judging by other comments and looking at the escape route room plans posted on each floor! This was disappointing because the room was what one could only describe as a standard size and not particularly generous. I do not know if this was allocated because we booked through an on-line agent and we were also allocated the 4th floor with views directly into the Art University classroom next door. Not a chance of drawing back the net curtains. I had requested a room higher up, but to no avail.All staff were helpful and friendly and the availability of restaurants, proximity to Union Square and many more sights within walking distance plus the cable car right outside made this a very good choice of hotel.

<Content>Clean and beautiful We arrived at The Orchard and loved the location and style of the building. The lobby is well appointed and the staff was incredible. We (and our friends) were upgraded to suites and they were spacious and clean, clean, clean! There's a great pizza place on the corner and the cable cars are closeby. A great hotel at any price and a suite bargain with the free upgrade for around $200 per night. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Perfect Location, great hotel My husband and I stayed at the Orchard in late September for our anniversary celebration. We were seeking a reasonably priced boutique hotel with a good central location for seeing San Francisco - the Orchard delivered! This was a perfectly located hotel - ideal for walking around Union Square and for getting to good restaurants. The hotel was clean, spacious for city accomodations and had nice ammenities. We found the noise levels to be very good considering we were right on a busy city block - we had no trouble sleeping. Let me qualify by saying that we live in N. VA in a quiet suburb where there are hardly any noises accept the horses and cows that reside nearby. Our only complaint was our very noisy neighbors who partied from 1:30am to 5:30am. Here the hotel could have improved - the ability to clearly hear your neighbors in the next door room was shocking. Service was friendly and efficient and our special requests (high floor and late check out) were honored with a smile. We would stay here again when visiting San Fran.

<Content>Very pleasant The Orchard was everything you'd expect from a nice, moderately priced boutique hotel. Every member of the staff was very outgoing and helpful. They made sure to ask me what time I'd be out of my room each day so that they could plan housekeeping services, and hailed cabs for me whenever I needed them. Loved the bath products, down comforter, and very comfy bed. The free wifi was easy to connect to and totally reliable. Just a couple of blocks from Union Square, the Orchard's location can't be beat.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Fabulous Location We had a wonderful stay at the Orchard. The front desk staff was so very helpful directing us about the city. We were mere steps from the Powell Street cable car line (get the muni pass!), two blocks from the Chinatown gate, a few blocks from Union Square and about a 20 minute walk to the Ferry Building or Fisherman's Wharf. Our room was on the 5th floor overlooking Bush street, we could see the top of the Mark Hopkins out our windows. Bed was quite comfy although our pillows were a bit squishy for my taste. The room and bathroom were both large, clean and bright. I'd definitely stay here again without thinking twice.

<Content>Ticks all the boxes We booked a double and a twin room well in advance and phoned the day before to confirm. However, on arrival we were given two doubles which was really inappropriate for the people involved. They ended up having a roll-away bed for the night. The staff were a bit dismissive about the whole episode and didn't really want to know. The next day, a twin was made available and after a great deal of negotiation, the people involved got a free breakfast. Other than that, a great little hotel. Centrally located. Short stroll down to Union Square and a 5 minute tram or taxi to Fishermans Wharf. The bar was friendly and had good happy hour offers on drinks and snacks. The rooms were comfortable and well appointed. Personally, I would stay in the Fishermans Wharf region of SFO if I were to return. There was a greater choice of restaurants and generally more going on in the evenings.

<Content>Loved the Orchard Hotel Everything was perfect with my stay at the Orchard Hotel. Upon my arrival, I was greeted by the doorman, Bob. He came to my car and took my baggage and walked me to the front desk. Bob was extremely friendly At the front desk I was greeted by Grace. She was extremely friendly, telling me all the details about the hotel and giving me a code for the free high speed internet access. She also offered me a selection of movies that I could borrow and take to my room to play in the DVD player. My room was spacious and charming. I decided to grab a late night bite to eat. I went to the front desk and Grace recommended a wonderful restaurant right down the hill called Scala's. The I retreated to my comfy bed with remote control in hand and snack from the mini bar to turn in for the night. The next morning, I got my wake up call promptly at 5:45am by an actual live person and started to get ready for my day. The bathroom was spacious and had a separate tub and shower. The EO products were wonderful. I checked out and stored my luggage. Later that afternoon Bob greeted me, called for my car, got my luggage out of storage and helped place my bags in my car, as I went on my way home.

<Content>A Wonderful Experience My first impression was very favorable because the hotel honored a less expensive rate I found on Travelocity and Expedia. From there it only got better! The room was large and wonderfully appointed - and I love a bathroom that is roomy and has lots of counter space! Breakfast was very reasonable and the presentation was equal to any place we have ever been - very nicely done. We came back to the hotel in the middle of the afternoon and the bar person served us a drink even though they weren't technically open. The lady at the front desk assisted me with printing my boarding passes...really, everything and everyone was just great. Our room fronted on the street so we did hear some noises during the night, but the bed was so soft there was no problem falling back to sleep. And the location is great - just off Union Square - so, if you are a walker it's perfect.I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great stay at the Orchard Spent 6 days at the Orchard -- and didn't want to leave! A perfect location, spectacular service, wonderful rooms -- and extremely comfortable beds! What else could you want? We requested the honor bar items removed, so we could bring in our own drinks, etc. A great location, next to Powell on Bush -- close to lots of restaurants and shopping. Had a room on the 10th floor overlooking Bush and didn't hear any street noise. Each hotel employee we came into contact with was professional and more than helpful. Ask about great restaurants! Clean, well-kept and well appointed. The DVD library was also a great addition. There is a reason why this hotel is rated so highly. They truly deserve it. You won't be disappointed!

<Content>Fantastic Boutique Hotel! Room:We had a queen-sized room that faced the hotel across the alley. The lack of view wasn't a huge concern; we could still hear the trolley go by but were spared most other traffic noise. The bed was fabulous, with fresh linens and a down duvet. The room was fairly good-sized, with a table, armoire, etc. Bath products were from Aveda -- yum!Extras:We enjoyed the best continental breakfast EVER in the restaurant downstairs. Fresh coffee, cold cuts, fruit, toast/bagels, you name it. It was a very relaxing start to a busy SF day.Reservations:I made reservations off of the hotel website, which sometimes offers specials that Expedia misses. The price for this hotel is fairly reasonable, given the central location and quality of the hotel. Location:Right off of Powell Street, above Union Square. I used to live in this neighborhood and loved the proximity to shopping, great restaurants, and the downtown atmosphere. The lower Nob Hill/upper Union Square location means you'll feel safe walking down the street. Note that parking will run you around $30/night, either through the hotel valet or any of the lots down the street.

<Content>Totally overrated There were a myriad of little things that made our stay at this hotel forgettable and irritating. We stayed here along with a few other people and each of us independently had similar problems with our the hotel and the staff. To start, the room wasn't ready until well after the time they said it would be available. The rooms themselves are fine, but the air conditioning fails sometime around 1 AM leaving the room stuffy until 5ish. Although there is internet, the desks aren't set up for business travel, having no laptop-accessible outlets. Also, the room card keys repeatedly failed, forcing us to trek back down to the front desk to ask for new keys. The front desk seemed perpetually unsurprised and unconcerned about this; we never received an apology for the inconvenience. Also, we asked the front desk to arrange a car service for us on the second night of our stay. After taking down the information and the time they promptly forgot to actually call and make the arrangements. Finally, they lost our friend's rental car in the valet. After giving them her ticket, they promptly returned with the wrong car. It took them over half an hour to find the right car.

<Content>Great Room and Great Location I booked this room through Expedia and after reading the reviews from Trip Advisor I was expecting to find a boutique (i.e. small) hotel room. I was pleasantly surprised to see the size of the room to be quite large. The location of the hotel is also great, as it is a few blocks from Union Square.The one negative regarding the hotel (not just the hotel but anywhere in San Francisco) is the parking situation. I believe the valet parking is $45/night, but I found parking offsite for $20/night. The public transportation is quite good, so once I parked the car, I never took it out again until we were leaving.I would definitley stay at the Orchard again.

<Content>Central location; helpful staff; comfortable My wife and I (late 50s) stayed at the Orchard Hotel for 4 nights in late June 2008.Location: very convenientThe hotel, at the intersection of Bush St and Powell St, is a few minutes walk (up a steep hill) from Union Square. A cable car stops right outside but was often full.Food: goodWe ate breakfast once in the hotel and would recommend it. Next door is a very busy, small restaurant, Roxanne's, which serves good breakfasts.Room: comfortableThe room was comfortable, spacious enough, quiet and typical of many we stayed in during our 3 week holiday in the US south-west. There was a safe in the room (free of charge).Parking: didn't have a carParking charges in the hotel appeared expensive. We got a pre-booked mini-bus (Lorries) from the airport to the hotel: this was very satisfactory. We used the excellent public transport and didn't hire a car (or need one) until we were leaving San Francisco.Staff: helpfulWe had a problem with our mobile phone and a staff member gave us helpful, friendly and very valuable advice on how to overcome our difficulty.OverallIf we return to San Francisco the Orchard will be at the very top of our list of hotels to check out. We definitely recommend it.

<Content>The Orchard--A Return to Civility The Orchard offered us a comfortable, friendly and enjoyable stay during a recent two day trip to San Franscisco. The rooms were comfortable, the continental breakfast was extensive. Best of all the staff made every effort to anticipate and support our needs for a comfortable stay. The Bellman/Concierge was especially helpful and knowlegable and steered us to great restaurants and went beyond the call of duty in helping us to problem solve some unrelated logistical issues.

<Content>Terrific rooms I travel to SF frequently and have passed this hotel without noticing it many times. The TripAdvisor reviews we so good I decided to try it last week. I'm glad I did.Thhe rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. My king bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was big and bright. Breakfast buffet was good, too.This hotel is located on Nob Hill and is a convenient walk to the Financial District, Union Square and China Town. The Powell St. cable car goes right by it.

<Content>So nice, so friendly I have just come back from San Francisco and I must say I loved The Orchard Hotel a lot. We were 3 in our party and we enjoyed the King suite, which was sooooo nice: 2 wonderful and well furnished rooms + a very large bathroom with bathtub and shower. The service was also very good and friendly, everything good they have said about this hotel I confirm! My feeling while I was staying there was of home away from home...pity our holiday is over, but I would like to come back to the Orchard.

<Content>A Hidden Treasure Just like a majority of San Francisco Hotels, the Orchard rooms are on the smaller side, not tiny, just smaller. Though they do have large bathrooms and well lighted, with Aveda Products! I was very impressed with the hotel because of it's friendly, welcoming staff, modern rooms and location. The Orchard is in walking distance of Union Square, Financial District  Chinatown. The price was very reasonable ($149 on Friday, for one night, which included parking and continental breakfast.)One very nice amenity of the hotel is there is a DVD player in the room. It was nice to be able to come back, in the evening, and enjoy a movie. They have a nice selection of movies to borrow at no additional charge. Also, the continental breakfast was very yummy and had a nice selection. With the high cost of hotels in San Francicso, this was an excellent, modern hotel with a low budget price.

<Content>Loved the Orchard Hotel The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The rooms were nice and the beds were very comfortable. The extra-large shower was a nice surprise. The wireless internet access was easy to use and consistent. We took advantage of the complimentary DVD movies on the last night, which was a nice way to wind down at the end of the day. We had a package that included breakfast, which was great - lots of fresh fruit was available. No complaints and we'd definitely stay again.

<Content>an excellent choice as a boutique hotel Having done some research we chose the Orchard as the first stop of our visit to California in celebration of our 25th wedding anninversary. It was a perfect beginning to our trip. Well located above Union Square and close to Chinatown the staff were so friendly and accommodating. The room was tastefully decorated and serviced twice a day - having the bed turned down at night was a nice touch.As an unexpected bonus we were able to check our emails/internet via a laptop at Reception - very useful for keeping up contact with home in Ireland!!Unfortunately we never availed of the opportunity to eat in the hotel as there are so many excellent restaurants in the area and of course the world famous 'Sears' was just around the corner for breakfast.One thing that will always stay in my memory, and indeed reflects the hospitality of the Orchard, is that, upon meeting the maid every morning she always took time to say hello and wish us a nice day. A small gesture, but it is little things like that which make the Orchard a little more special.If I ever go back to SF it will certainly be my No.1 choice!

<Content>Nice hotel, needs updating and cleaning standards Chose the hotel due to the ratings. Stayed at room 1010 which is located at the back. Quiet hotel as others guest have pointed out. No minibar! Very quiet aircon that could be adjusted easily. Small hotel and not many guests the 4 nights we stayed there. Located in a nice area with only a couple of minutes walk to the pizza restaurant or convenience store. The cable car stops 50 meters from the entrance! Going downhill on Powell Street you will end up in Union Square with all the shops. Going downhill on Bush street the you will pass the entrance to Chinatown within minutes. Chinafood? Check out the Great Eastern restaurant, great food!The hotel needs an update, its a bit boring compared to its twin sister, The Orchard Garden. What was really dissapointing was the not-so-clean bathroom. There was hair on the doorframe and the walls, and the ceiling was quite discusting. When taking a hot shower there will always be small particles of fat from the skin that stick to the vapour. The fat will deposit on the ceiling and create spots. I informed the front desk about the problem but the problem remained when we left the hotel. The lights on both sides of the mirror were also full of dust. I think it was not solved due to lack of cleaning standards. The person responsible for cleaning the bathroom obviously did not understand the nature of the problem and could not choose the appropriate solution. My point is this; when there is a complaint about the cleanliness of a bathroom, the responsible manager should take immediate action and take a look in detail. A dirty bathroom is a no-no in this business.Othervise, I would recommend the hotel. Tom  Synne

<Content>Loved the Orchard After booking another hotel in the city, I found the Orchard on thiswebsite and immediately cancelled the other reservation and booked this one---THANK GOODNESS!!! It was everything wehoped for. It's a beautiful new hotel--very clean and comfortable,and in a great location. Our room was on the 8th floor, facing the street but it was very quiet. The continental breakfast was goodand more than adequate to start your day and all of the staff werevery friendly and helpful. A great bargain for this city.

<Content>Very comfortable This hotel has the basics covered very well. Rooms were new, clean, spacious, quiet and very comfortable. There were six different kinds of pillows to ensure the pickiest sleeper (me) had the perfect one. The bathroom vanity had lots of space for my toiletries which I don't always find in a city hotel. I only ate breakfast at the hotel once (food too salty but coffee was amazing) as Sears Diner (best breaki in San Fran) is around the corner as are many great restaurants. The on-site exercise room is small and uninspiring - use the off-site one for a fee. The staff were friendly and sweet and actually kind! Each of my 4 days started with 3 or 4 different staff members wishing me a happy day. The Orchard is a steep uphill block from Union Square - something to keep in mind if you have mobility issues.I have stayed at the Fairmont, Four Seasons and Westin St Francis (among others) and they are fine if you want a grand/posh experience. If, however, you are in San Francisco for San Francisco and not your hotel, the Orchard is perfect. I will be staying at the Orchard every time now.

<Content>Lovely - But.... A great hotel, lovely rooms and the bed was the best i think ive ever slept in.Only problem were some of the staff. 4 of us stayed who are all mid 20s and we seemed to be treated as unwanted. After a horrible time trying to check in (we were all coming at different times, and one of us having to wait 10 hours before being aloud in the room), we then seemed to be ignored and treated pretty badly, but most of the other guests were always greeted very warmly.This didnt bother us too much but we paid the same money as everyone else and were treated differently.But apart from that a lovely hotel

<Content>Excellent Hotel! We stayed here with our fourteen year-old granddaughter for five nights in early July. We had a king suite that was ideal for us since we all had our own space. The entire hotel staff was attentive including the desk people heating a Hot Pocket for our granddaughter each morning in the employee lounge. (I would suggest a microwave in the room or at least one in public space.)The hotel was clean as a pin, quiet (9th floor), well located and fully met our expectations. We would definitely stay again.

<Content>Would Stay Again We chose the Orchard Hotel for our 3 night stay in San Francisco based on the Trip Advisor reviews and we weren't disappointed. The hotel is a great base for visiting the city as it is only a couple of blocks back from Union Square in the direction of Fisherman's Warf. It is well maintained with helpful staff and good sized bed  bathrooms.We would definitely recommend this hotel for a city break to San Francisco and will stay here again.

<Content>San Francisco's Gem.... One of San Francisco's small botique hotels. The staff are friendly and courteous. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Large bathrooms, with quality amenities. You can tell there's someone keeping a close eye to make sure guests are well-treated. This was my third stay at the hotel and definitely won't be my last.

<Content>Deserves the high rating There were 6 of us stopping overnight on our way to Napa.We didn't expect to use much of the hotel facililties, so can't comment on that. However, I had the opportunity to view three rooms and they were all very nicely appointed , and clean. Furnishing is contemporary, and TV/DVD are of brand name( Sony) with excellent picture quality( though not LCD). Had our stay been longer, we would have made use of the DVD movies available at front desk. Bathroom is large and bright. The hotel is very central, and there's lots to see within the surrounding blocks. I was very concerned with noise from garbage trucks that was written up previously on this forum, so I asked for a quiet room. Heard nothing! Neither did our friends who stayed down the hall, and those facing the front side of the street.Staff is very friendly, and the conceirge called transportation for us very swiftly. We had valet parking, and it takes 15-20 min to have our car delivered. Breakfast is in a restaurant type setting, but selection is somewhat limited. It offers convenience but not quality.Price is what makes this a top choice for me on my next visit, as it represents great value for such a central and newly furnished hotel.

<Content>Excellent Hotel for Excellent Price Well I have to agree with all of the other positive reviews about this hotel. We stayed for seven nights at the height of tourist season and were not disappointed.From the moment we checked in we were impressed, they had the exact room I asked for, high floor, no connecting door and street view, and that's exactly what I got.The staff was super friendly and always asked us if we needed any assistance, the rooms were very clean and big, as was the bathroom. The bartender/waiter in their bar was friendly, polite and always at our service...the happy hour $3 lemon-drop martinis were a great hit after a long day of walking.We got a great deal through Expedia and I can say that we have stayed at far more expensive hotels with far less service and smaller rooms...they even come in and turn your bed down in the late afternoon.Their lobby may be a bit small but who cares I don't stay in hotel lobbies, I stay in hotel rooms and that's where this hotel shines.Also, it is extremely well located, a quick walk to Union Square, the cable care stops right beside the hotel (BTW we didn't hear any cable car noise from our room) and the cable cars take you right down to Fisherman's Wharf, or China Town, or Little Italy.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone; do a good search on the internet because they have some great deals here at different times of the year.

<Content>Awesome Orchard Hotel on a budget is possible! We were traveling on a budget, and somehow managed to go during a slow time and got our room for $149 a night. We purchased groceries outside of San Fran (we came from Sonora) and brought them to the hotel. We got the key for the refrigerator and emptied out the hotel's pricey contents and put them in a box that the hotel provided so we could put our own food in the fridge instead. That way we were able to eat our breakfasts and lunches without having to pay restaurant prices! At the end of our 3-day stay we put everything from the hotel stock back into the refrigerator and locked it up and returned the key. Worked out great, and the hotel staff helped us keep on our budget without our feeling cheap!We parked our car at a garage just 3 blocks down from the hotel, so we were able to save a bit by not using the valet parking of the hotel. It saved us about $12 each day, which adds up!The people working at the Orchard were extremely helpful and friendly. The doormen were exceptionally nice and willing to help in whatever way they could. The front desk staff was great, too. We tried to tip the maids and doormen for their services and they seemed very appreciative, not like they just expected it. The king sized bed we had was SOOOOOOO comfortable. The comforter on top and the 100% Egyptian cotton sheets were wonderful after a long day of walking around S.F. We also enjoyed watching movies using the free DVDs from the front desk and the DVD player in the room.The Azur brand lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner made us feel pampered and smelled so good. We requested that the maid leave some extra and left her a tip, and we were delighted to have a few extra! The large bathroom allowed us to spread out and added to the luxurious atmosphere.The location is excellent. Close to China town, a cable car line, Union Square, etc. The Golden Gate bridge is a short drive away, too.One caution: My knees had serious problems with the incredibly steep streets, even with excellent walking shoes. Take the public transportation whenever possible, and save your legs for seeing the sights! The only downside was our view. We requested a high floor, which they granted. But our view was of the top of another building, and other buildings beyond. The location was quiet, however.We loved the Orchard Hotel and appreciated everything that the staff did to make our stay wonderful! Thanks!

<Content>Glad we stayed at The Orchard!! My husband and I just stayed at The Orchard Hotel in San Francisco for our 20th wedding anniversary, and it was terrific. The staff was very welcoming, and helpful when we asked questions. The room was very spacious, and very clean. That probably was the most comfortable bed that I have ever slept in! We loved that we did not need to mess with a car, as the hotel is right on a cable car line, and we could buy a multi-day Muni pass reasonably, and ride cable cars and buses for the entire time we were there. We were very close to lots of shopping, and just a cable car ride away from many other attractions. We had breakfast at 2 places that were very close and we would recommend--Roxanne's and Lori's Diner. We also had great pizza at Uncle Vito's right on the corner close to the hotel, and it was reasonably priced!! It was very good too!! It was more pricey, but dinner at Scoma's down on the water one night was terrific too!! The highlight of our trip, was a tour through Napa Valley with the Wine Country Tour Shuttle--it was well worth the money that we spent for that special day!! We are very glad that we stayed at The Orchard, and would stay again in a heart beat!!

<Content>The Orchard great value for an excellent hotel! We have stayed at this boutique hotel several times. Now we are traveling with our teenagers/young adults and get them a separate connecting room. The hotel is the best value for the money. Clean, contemporary, easy to get in an out of and a fabulous location. We parked our car and never drove. We walked or took cabs. My husband travels on business and has stopped going to other more expensive chain hotels to stay at the Orchard Inn instead. Give it a try!

<Content>Honeymoon at the Orchard My wife and I stayed at the Orchard hotel for our honeymoon. We stayed in one of the hotel's King suites. Upon arrival we were greeted my the doorman who unloaded our car and took our bags inside. The front desk checked us in a went over some of the necessities. The doorman got our room number and told us he would have someone bring our bags to the room for us. When we got off the elevator on our floor we saw the two things one never wants to see next to their room; the elevator and the ice machine. Being easy going people we decided to give it a night to see if the noise levels would be counterproductive to our honeymoon. I am pleased to say that we never heard the elevators, or the ice machine. Which was a huge relief, because when I operated the ice machine I thought I had triggered and avalanche. Our encounters with the hotel staff where always pleasant and friendly. The hotel was clean, and my new wife loved the fact that we received chocolate every night. I would be happy to recommend the Orchard hotel to anyone looking for a hotel in the heart of San Francisco within walking distant of many landmarks, restaurants and entertainment centers.

<Content>Kudos to The Orchard! The Orchard is a lovely, affordable oasis near enough but not in the heart of the Union Square rush. The cable car is right on the corner and the bus just a few blocks away making the hotel's location very convenient. The rooms are attractive and clean and were kept that way throughout our stay. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. All personnel we dealt with were friendly and knowledgeable about the city and environs making good recommendations about transportation and places to eat. A nice touch is free DVDs to borrow and play in your room after a long day of sightseeing. We would return to this hotel and recommend it to others as a real value in the heart of the city.

<Content>Hop, skip and a jump We were able to book our room at the last minute which was nice. We live only 60 miles away and sometimes prefer to hop down without plans. The staff was great, the room was nice. We had other plans so were unable to try the restaurant. The location is great for cable car access and Union Square. We will return for sure. The Orchard Garden Hotel is nice also and their restaurant was superb.

<Content>Green, convenient and comfy boutique Nicely appointed - a little spa like with its streamlined decor, Aveda products, and the wall fountain in the lobby. When you decide to turn in, this makes for a quiet respite from the hustle and bustle outside. My friend and I shared a room w/2 doubles. Beds were comfy, and we found it spacious enough for two girls with large suitcases. And we especially loved that it was walking distance to China Town, Union Square, the Convention Center, North Beach. One night, we ended up eating a late night meal at the restaurant downstairs (Roots) because we were too tired to go out again. We had excellent service, and were pleased to also find that the food was both fresh and well-prepared.

<Content>Good location just above the chaos of Union Square We were upgraded to a suite without question when only a king room was available. This speaks to the kind and attentive service we found throughout our stay.

<Content>EXCELLENT hotel My boyfriend and friends and I stayed at the Orchard Hotel at the end of this May. I found them through tripadvisor and the reviews said that they were in a great location in union square which was important to us. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with friendly smiles and welcomes...the hotel is immaculate, the room was beautiful and included breakfast. we walked to chinatown the first day and all through union square. the cable car is right there to take you anywhere you need to go...i would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again when i'm in san francisco.

<Content>Worth the money Recently stayed her for nearly a week on a business trip. While the view from my sixth floor window left much to be desired (it was the top of a neighboring building), the room itself was pleasantly large and comfortable.The bed was quite comfortable and there were a wealth of pillows provided. The bathroom was roomy and well lit.Even though Bush Street runs right out front and Powell St. runs just one building away, the rooms were pleasantly quiet and very little street noise seemed to reach the room. The cable car's bell and the back-up beeper used by a garbage truck were the among the few exceptions.The staff was quite friendly and my concerns were all met quickly and completely.There were safes and coffee makers in the rooms, along with DVD players and surround sound systems. You could check-out DVDs from a number that were available at the front desk. The wireless internet access was reasonably snappy, though the service provider's access control mechanism was clunky. In addition, the service provider (Wi-Fi Guys) would periodically inject ads into your web surfing, which was more than annoying.The room could be a bit dark at night, but lamps were generally placed where they were needed. For some mysterious reason, one of the lamps was hooked into a switch that also controlled the light directly over the entrance door. That meant leaving a light on where it wasn't needed if I wanted the light turned on elsewhere in the room.There were no recycling bins obviously available for any sort of recyclable material (newspaper, bottles, cans, etc). Given San Francisco's well publicized attempts to encourage more recycling, the lack of recycling bins was disappointing.

<Content>Great overall - good location, good value We stayed at the Orchard Hotel for 3 nights. We were able to book using their promotional 3 for 2 in the City package, which gave us 3 nights for the price of two and included a basic hotel breakfast every morning.The hotel was everything a boutique hotel should be. Smaller, quieter, with more individual attention from staff, who were friendly and eager to help. If you tend to like booking with smaller independent hotels rather than larger chains you will not be disappointed with the Orchard.The rooms were attractive, comfortable, clean and well kept as were the hallways  elevators. The only meals we ate at the hotel were breakfast and they were good. Public transportation runs close by but we usually used cabs or walked wherever we wanted to go. Cabs are harder to hail here than they are in NYC so having an attentive, cab-hailing doorman was a real plus.Shopping in this area is plentiful and easy to reach on foot. You should be able to find just about anything you want to buy - from the lower end HM, Ross, Old Navy all the way up to designer shops. Its interesting how they kind of mingle together in this area.My only negative comment (and I know this is really picky) was the condition of the house phones. They were so filthy I chose not to use one. No I didn't remark on this to the staff but I should have. I am certain if I had those phones would have been spotless the next time I tried to use one. That's the kind of staff this hotel has. My advice - book this hotel and enjoy!

<Content>Fabulous stay at The Orchard Hotel My husband and I stayed at The Orchard Hotel for 5 nights in late June and were very pleased. Our room, a King on the 8th floor, was spotless. The bed was among the most comfortable I've encountered. The bathroom was clean and spacious with plenty of towels and counter space. Wireless service was strong and worked perfectly in the room.The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful.The location is perfect--right off Union Square, near cable cars, incredible shopping, and restaurants.And..the price for all this was reasonable, $149 per night. Although this price did not include breakfast, there were wonderful restaurant choices within mere yards of the hotel.We highly recommend this hotel and will surely stay there on future visits to San Francisco!

<Content>Good location, enjoyed our stay at Orchard My wife and I recently spent three night at the Orchard Hotel. We chose the hotel because of its proximity to Union Square. Our room was of decent size, nicely furnished and clean. The hotel's staff was courtesy and friendly. The prices in the hotel's restaurant and bar were on the high side but with a number of restaurants in the area, this was not a problem. The one negative was noise from the room next door; the rooms had a connecting door that - I think - allowed voices and other sounds to be heard between the rooms. While this provided for a couple of annoying moments, we didn't lose any sleep or feel the need to complain.Overall, we were pleased with our stay at the Orchard Hotel and would stay there again.

<Content>Great Place! Location, staff, room, cleanliness, price... What's missing?The room was great. The staff was very helpfull and friendly - they left us chocolates and wine for our anniversary. The location worked out perfectly. We walked up a huge hill just a couple of blocks (part of the San Francisco experience), then it was down hill all the way through China Town and North Beach (Little Italy) to Fisherman's Warf. We road a Trolley back and it dropped us 1/2 block from the Hotel. Then we walked about 2 blocks to dinner that night. There are several great places to eat in the area.

<Content>Great Value! This was the first time to San Francisco for my husband and I (we were there as part of our honeymoon). First of all, the location of this hotel is PERFECT! A block away from Union Square and Chinatown, great restaurant choices, and not far from everything else. We really felt like we were in the middle of everything. The hotel itself was clean and comfortable and the staff was very friendly. My only complaint was that they didn't have a vending area and I had to go to the bar and spend $3 on a can of Coke. I would definately stay here again and you certainly cannot beat the price for a hotel in the city.

<Content>Great Stay! We loved this hotel! First time in San Francisco, and this hotel is central to everything. We were so busy during our time in San Francisco doing the tourist thing, we really didn't spend that much time in the hotel. However, the staff was great, and the chambermaids made sure to leave us extra shampoo  conditioner. We didn't get a chance to try the breakfast, since we were always on the go- however I am sure it wouldn't disapoint! A+

<Content>Great hotel, great price. In reading the other reviews you already get the picture. This is a fantastic hotel. I'll just run down a few points of my own:Great location, just 2 blocks from the famous gate to Chinatown and right in the middle of the action. There's good dining nearby as well.The rooms were clean, modern, and the beds were very comfortable, which for me is the #1 concern. The staff was helpful and booked us dinner reservations every night at different places around town. Now for the big plus and this is the one that pushed it over from 4 to 5 stars: The price was easily the best value for the money in San Francisco. Maybe it was just good luck, but the Orchard is priced the same or below hotels that aren't even half as good. My wife travels frequently for business and she's paid almost 2 times the rate at the orchard and had a worse room in a far worse location. San Fran is expensive, way to go Orcahrd for delivering a great hotel at a decent price. Stay at the Orchard, you won't be disappointed.

<Content>good value for money Nice hotel with boutique flair in good location (at least for tourism, which is what we were doing). Cable car stop is almost right in front of it and it is within walking distance of Union Sq and Chinatown. Surprisingly large rooms and nice bathrooms. Very friendly staff and some nice touches (DVD player in room and free DVD rental), which you would not find in a chain hotel. The only downside was the breakfast (continental b/fast included inb rate) which was sub standard for this kind of hotel, but then again they did not charge much for it.

<Content>Perfect Stay The Orchard is a jewel. It is tasteful, attentive staff, lovely rooms and great central location. Near to Chinatown, cable car , Union Square .We were at a conference at a big hotel and changed when the event ended.It was a relief to find such a peaceful setting. Good local neighborhood and can recommend Uncle Vito;s on the corner for neighborhood pizza.Staff was very helpful and friendly .They came up with excellent suggestions.The one reservation is if a traveler has a health , breathing or mobility concerns as the hills are killers.Their companion hotel the Orchard Garden 3 blocks away, is on a flatter area that is also central.Loved our stay!

<Content>Good dreal for the location We had a very pleasant stay at the Orchard. The staff was very friendly and helpful, particularly the doorman. Our room was quite comfortable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the Union Square area at a very reasonable price.

<Content>Lovely room, great location The Orchard Hotel was a great place to stay in San Francisco. Lovely room, high quality furniture, good size bathroom and a very big shower. The rate was excellent for a central city hotel (just around the corner from Union Square) and you get free Wi-Fi which is a real bonus. Breakfast is available at a selection of nearby diners all a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. I would definitely recommend The Orchard if you're looking for great quality in a central location at an affordable rate.

<Content>Good Place, with suggestions This is a quiet, very comfortable place to stay in a notoriously expensive and noisy city. Best rates are on the hotel's website (we prepaid $159 per night for bed and breakfast, plus an additional $19.22 per night in taxes), and we would stay there again in a flash. The hotel is soundproof and the location is perfect, only steps away from the Bush/Powell intersection and an easy jaunt to all of downtown. The California street Cable Car line is two blocks up Nob Hill; Market Street is five short blocks south. We didn't have a car, but the hotel offers in-and-out valet parking for $38 per night, a pretty good rate considering you are in the heart of The City.Dinner in the hotel's restaurant, Daffodil's, was only so-so however; husband's flatiron steak was superb, but my pork tenderloin entree was dry and tasteless, very overcooked. The waitress said the chef prefers to serve the pork rare, probably because he has never heard of trichinosis and has no idea how easy it is to cook a pork tenderloin to non-pink, tender perfection. Whatever, I suggest you select something else from what seemed to be a relatively limited, somewhat precocious menu. Be aware that there are tiny, easily overlooked coupons at the far end of the reception desk that knock $20 off your dinner bill. The restaurant didn't seem very busy on any of the three nights we were in residence; perhaps the management should put one of those $20 coupons in with the room key at check-in. The European-style breakfast buffet was more than adequate and included juices, cold cuts, cheese, tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs, assorted cereals (with yogurt available), a variety of fruit, delicious croissants and muffins, bread and bagels for toasting, teas, coffee, and so on. Hot breakfasts were available at an extra charge.We had the San Francisco Chronicle outside our door every morning, and both USA Today and the Wall Street Journal were also complimentary at the front desk.The room had free wireless, and the bathroom was large and well appointed with good linens. Shower/Tub was clean with excellent water pressure. Little noise transferred from adjacent rooms. The in-room coffee was not memorable. Elevators were prompt and swift.The beds are cloud-like, almost too much so. After an uncomfortably hot first night alternating between the too hot duvet and too cold sheet as a cover, we requested a regular blanket rather than the fluffy duvet -- problem solved. The huge pillows are deep and fluffy, nice if that's want you like but miserable if you prefer something smaller and firmer. A selection of pillows amid the six on the bed would have been much appreciated.The decor is very tailored with extremely nice furnishings, and the staff was highly professional and pleasant. All in all, the Orchard proved to be ideal for our all-too-short stay in SF.

<Content>The good reviews are all true We chose the Orchard Hotel for a 3 night stay based on the excellent reviews on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed. The rooms are very clean and spacious with good bathrooms. We felt that the price we paid ( we booked directly with the hotel) represented good value especially since a simple continental breakfast was included. All the staff are very helpful and courteous.We can ceratinly recommend this boutique style hotel.

<Content>Great Place, Great Space This hotel was in a most convenient location, close to Union Square, Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, the Embarcadero, and many other famous locales. The staff, especially the bellman/concierge, Cornell, was fabulous. He was most helpful in finding great restaurants and places of interest. The hotel itself is beautiful and elegant, quite a bargain. I'll definitely stay there the next time I'm in San Francisco.

<Content>The Reviews do not Lie--Great Place We loved this hotel. We have stayed in SF @ Westin, Mark Hopkins, and maybe others. This was by far the best hotel experience we've ever had--anywhere. Quiet, peaceful, great location. We stayed on a higher floor and heard neither traffic nor noise. We did not order services of any kind from this hotel. The room had everything, including surround sound. We checked out one DVD from their free service, but never watched it. The hotel is right by Union Square, and right next to Sears Fine Food, which provided GREAT breakfast!!! We loved this hotel. Nice bedding, firm mattress, great, clean room, huge room overall.. and QUIET. Nice staff too. This is a BEAUTIFUL hotel that blew away Mark Hopkins. The staff were approachable and we loved the place. There are dining places and a cable car stop right next to the hotel. Walgreens, food, Hertz, and other services are all within walking distance. A true find, this hotel is amazing.

<Content>Loved it as usual...will be going back in June. While my husband and I live in Marin County, which is only 25 minutes away from The Orchard Hotel in San Francisco, we love going there for the weekend. When we do several times a year we always stay at the Orchard Hotel on Bush and Powell Streets. We were just there last weekend (May 24 and 25th) to celebrate my birthday...and as usual the hospitality was A+. We also love the decor and the location -- we are a block from China Town. Would highly recommend this hotel for out of towners or locals like ourselves.

<Content>Nice room, shame about the breakfast experience My family and I stayed at the Orchard this April on our way to Greece. The position of the hotel is good being close to Union Square. We stayed in one of the King suites which had a lounge and separate bedroom.The room was comfortable and clean with plenty of room for us all. We had a few glitches on our arrival which got things off to a less than ideal start but nothing too dramatic. As we had a 2 year old, we requested a cot (or crib or play-pen as they call them in the States) to be in our room. Unfortunately, on our arrival (after a 12 hour flight) our now asleep baby had no cot. The first that arrived was broken but the 2nd worked fine. Then we couldn't get into the fridge because it had a lock on it! I have never stayed in hotel with a lock on the fridge.. it seemed a little odd. The lock was broken and the fridge could not be opened. This was fixed quickly which was good because my needed to keep her insulin cool. Then when we tried to use the coffee machine in the room, it belched out rotten smelling hot water with chunks of God knows what in it and eventually got a replacement (after staff intially telling us that was normal for those machines!).However, all the above was minor and not that much of a big deal and I only mention it here as all the other hotels we stayed in during our 1 month away had cots ready in the rooms, usable fridges and clean tea/coffee making fascilities.The biggest disappointment about our stay was at breakfast. We paid for a breakfast included package and for the most part the breakfast itself was ok... nothing startling (again compared to our other hotels) but good enough. We effectively served ourselves with little help from the two fairly sour looking staff on each morning. In fact, the male staff member serving made us feel quite unwelcome and seemed reluctant to be there or help.Now, tipping is not the custom in our country although i do understand it is big in the States and for the most part we follow that custom when in the USA . However, I expect good and pleasant service before forking out extra cash for a tip and if staff are off-hand, rude or make you fell generally unwelcome, then I don't think a tip is deserved. Due to the sour service received, we did not leave a tip on the first two mornings and one that second morning the male staff member gave me a lecture about tipping him. This was a surpirse and extremely rude. Although we had already paid for breakfast for the next two mornings, we did not eat at the hotel as I did not wish to feel pressured to pay extra (i.e. tip) for poor service or risk some form of retribution if we did not tip him from then on. In summary, the hotel was a pretty nice and convenient place to stay (with a few glitches intially but not too big a deal). However, definitely do not pre-pay for breakfast. You will eat a lot better elsewhere for less and get much better service (the pancake place around the corner was good for breakfast and Uncle Vito's do good pizza for dinner)

<Content>Great Location! We stayed 4 nights at this hotel. The location is very good, the cable car line is just around the corner and Union Square is just 3 minutes away. The room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom is very nice, the furniture is ok. What we did not like was the very expensive parking (38$ a day). Also the staff was argueing which should not happen in front of guests.

<Content>Great hospitality in the heart of San Francisco! I stayed at this hotel based on the excellent recommendations I read on Trip Advisor.It is a boutique hotel, which is well located for shopping in Union square.The rooms are modern, spacious, clean and well appointed, with good facilities for business (work desk and free wireless internet)..There is a pleasant restaurant on the ground floor, which serves either a continental or a la carte breakfast.The staff are friendly and helpful. They made me feel welcome and helped me with useful tips as a first time visitor.I recommend this hotel as representing good value for money.Besides the usual and expected features, there are several nice touches, like a library of several hundred DVD's available to view free of charge, quality toileries, etc.There is a general warmth of hospitality which makes for a pleasant stay.

<Content>Enjoyed the Orchard Experience Booked this Hotel after reading other reviews on Trip Advisor and was not disappointed. The Hotel is small but very reasonably priced for the area. The rooms are very comfortable and we had great nights sleep, didn't eat in hotel as was abit pricey for our liking, they did recommend very good eating places nearby that suited our requirements perfectly. Overall we were very pleased with this accommodation, and would choose to stay here again. The Cable Car is very handy but quite expensive to travel on single trips, so get a long term or multi trip ticket from the start.

<Content>Absolutely wonderful I cannot say enough good things about the Orchard. My daughter and I stayed in room 839 street side and we both loved it. The beds were comfy, the bathroom spacious with nice shampoos and lotions. Meticulously clean and nicely decorated. Wonderful location near union square right on a CC stop. We bought liquor and some mixers down the street at a small market and made our own nightcaps , breakfast we did at starbucks since we didn't have a breakfast package there were at least 2 within a 3 block area. I would recommend this hotel to anyone it was a quiet oasis in the heart of the city.

<Content>A really great experience in the middle of the city Really fair price for a beautiful, modern and environmentally friendly hotel in the middle of everything. I loved the in room book illustrating merchants in the city that are organic, natural or eco friendly. Same goes for the room and restaurant at the hotel. I had the Bed and Breakfast package that provided me with a fabulous breakfast each morning of my 3 day stay. The Granola was AMAZING as was the fresh grapefruit juice and wonderful coffee. Loved the video library available to guests. Really comfy bed. Super friendly staff. Everyone made me feel very welcome. Walked to work each day of my stay, which is in the financial district. Took about 10 minutes to get down there and I cherished the pretty walk through the bustling city each day. I would recommend the Orchard Hotel to anyone looking for personalized service from an independent, non chain hotel!

<Content>Old S.F. Charm, Modern Amenities, Great Location I鈥檓 just finishing up a contract here in San Francisco that had me flying in on Mondays and home on Fridays. I wanted a small hotel with the flavor of old San Francisco, not a generic national chain hotel. I spotted the Orchard on the internet but was unable to book it my first week. I ended up at one of the many older, small hotels that populate the area and the very first night challenged my preconceptions. I got a dinky room that looked into a 6 foot wide alleyway separating my hotel from the next building; the restroom was so small, I had to go outside to turn around; my air conditioner was an open window.I had already booked the following week at the Orchard and decided to pay an inspection visit just in case I needed to revisit the chain hotel option. I was delighted by the large rooms, new furniture, huge bathrooms, and comfy pillow-top beds. Each room is equipped with a DVD system and the front desk maintains a DVD library. The hotel building is new with all the safety features and amenities that includes; the visual elevation, however, is designed to fit in with the rest of the neighborhood. I immediately booked several more weeks and now I鈥檓 finishing up twenty weeks at the Orchard. The on-site restaurant, Daffodil, is first rate so on-site dining is rewarding if you鈥檙e not in the mood to go out. The staff is great: friendly and knowledgeable about the area; attentive to my routine. I鈥檝e been pleased with my decision to stay at the Orchard from a comfort, safety, and cultural standpoint. The Orchard has just the flavor to complement that special San Francisco 鈥渏e ne sais quoi鈥?without cramping my need for modern accommodations.Located on Bush Street, the Orchard is two blocks away from Union Square. It鈥檚 located in a city residential area that has both fine and everyday restaurants, stores, salons, an art school, Cathedral, and the like. The Orchard is just steps away from the cable-car line on cross-street Powell. Union Square, just down Powell, is bustling with all the well known shopping, eateries, and hotels competing for your attention. Chinatown鈥檚 Pine Street parallels Bush just one block further away from Union Square, while the main entrance on Grant Street is just two blocks down Bush. The location is 鈥淚DEAL.鈥?Plenty of attractions and amenities are within an easy walk, but the noise and congestion of the commercial area isn鈥檛 in your lap. Transportation to the wharf, Market Street, North Beach, and the rest that San Francisco offers is at your door.Put it this way, after twenty-one weeks, the Orchard remains my hotel-of-choice in San Francisco. I鈥檓 happy with my choice and I will be back.

<Content>Wonderful hotel!!! Stay here! What a wonderful hotel! I have not a negative thing to say about it. Amazing price for the level of service we got. Free movie rentals (the room comes with a dvd player and surround sound), free concierge service (extremely helpful finding places to eat), centrally located, comfortable beds, NICE room and bathroom, etc, etc. I felt like I was at home in the hotel. Stay here!

<Content>Nice stay at the Orchard My new bride and I stayed at the Orchard during part of our honeymoon. The staff was friendly and accommodating. We had a wonderful room on the 10th floor with a view that was very good for a downtown hotel. The room and bathroom size were above average. We also were never bothered by noise. The Orchard is two blocks from Union Square and two blocks from the entrance to Chinatown. It's steps away from the Powell St trolley line. If you have a car, parking in the area is very expensive, but that's not the hotel's fault. This hotel is in a convenient place and is a real value. We would stay there again.

<Content>Friendly, comfortable and central We stayed a couple of nights at the end of March 2008. The room was well equipped, the bed comfortable and the whole hotel ahd a feeling fo being well-cared for. Being right by the cable car was a real convenience and the hotel's position enabled us to see a great deal of the historic centre in a short stay.Well worth a stay.

<Content>A Great Place to Stay My girlfriend and I recently stayed at the Orchard Hotel during our trip to San Francisco (4/24-4/26). It was outstanding. Great location. Super views (we were on the 10th floor). Very clean and comfortable room. The service was extremely friendly. The hotel itself was everything we could've hoped for and a little bit more. We stayed at two other places during our trip (one in the city / one outside) and found that this hotel provided our most enojoyable/comfortable stay. The only drawback was that we were under the impression that our breakfast was included with the room and were then surprised to find out that wasn't the case. Unfortunately, nobody told us this up front and we found out last minute (as we were about to order). Very minor note overall. . .we walked down the street and had a great breakfast at Lori's. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy San Francisco. It is a boutique hotel with the ammenities of a major chain. We loved it.

<Content>Would recommend the Orchard. We returned yesterday from San Francisco and stayed at the Orchard from April 17th - 23rd. Since this was my first trip to SF I cannot compare it to other hotels, but found it to be very charming. The room was spacious, the bathroom absolutely spotless and the beds different from what I am used to but very comfortable. Check in was quick and smooth and all staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We did not visit the onsite restaurant because we felt the prices extremely high for the food offered. One disappointment was that the hotel had advertised that they had Aveda bath products but did not. Nice touches were the turndown service and the extremely comfortable robes available. Our room was very quiet with no outside noises. The hotel was one of the best parts of our stay.

<Content>Sleep great in a noisy city My husband and I decided to get-a-way for the weekend on very short notice; we love San Francisco. We found this charming Boutique Hotel on-line.The Orchard Hotels is located at Bush and Powell very near China Town. The cable cars stop at this corner. I was concerned about the noise because I am a light sleeper. We were on the street-side near the cable car stop; to my surprise I did not hear the traffic or cable cars. The desk clerk said the windows are treated with a sound-proofing material. Guess what; it works. The beds were great; I don鈥檛 remember when I slept so well.We dined at the hotel the first evening. The food was delightful; it is a new restaurant; I am sure once everyone finds it you won鈥檛 be able to get in.The weekend was great!

<Content>Great experience at The Orchard Hotel My daughter and I stayed for one night at The Orchard Hotel on a quick trip to San Francisco. We had a great experience and would highly recommend it. Even though the building is older, everything was updated and very clean. The staff were friendly and professional with prompt service, including valet parking. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. After doing a lot of searching on-line, I know that the price was reasonable for the location and type of hotel. This is not a generic hotel; rather we felt it was upscale yet cozy.We liked the location because it was right off the cable car line and only a couple of blocks away from Union Square. If you're a woman traveling alone, this would be a good choice. I would feel comfortable staying there on my own.

<Content>What a Gem! Its nice to find a business that's operated with the satisfactionof it's clientel in mind. The Orchard Hotel certainly is one ofthose businesses. We spent 4 days at this charming hotel.Since our flight from Atlanta arrived in San Francisco around11AM, we arrived at the hotel around 12:30PM. My wife procededinto the hotel while I took care of our driver and by the time Igot inside we had already been set up with a room on the 7thfloor. Not only were there no hassles regarding early check-in, the front desk acted like it was their pleasure to take care of us.Our room was nicely decorated and good sized. The bathroomwas marble and tile and also good sized. The bed was verycomfortable with 4 large pillows. The location of the hotel wasnear the corner of Bush  Powell, within a few feet of the Powellstreet cable car. Union Square is a 3 block walk downhill. Buythe 3 day metro pass for $11.00 and you can ride any publictransit including the cable car back up the hill. All hotel personnel were extremely pleasant and helpful. Our maid evenmade it a point to thank us for our daily tip. My hats off to theownership, management and personnel who operate this hotel.Wish there were more like you.

<Content>A Wonderful Find! This is a real find. The staff was great. Very friendly and always greeted me by name. Rooms are spacious , clean, and well equipped as were the bathrooms. Very well insulated. My room was close to the elevator but never heard a sound from the hall. The hotel offers a continental type breakfast, but prefered to eat at one of the many near-by restaurants at half the price! In fact, the restaurant would be my only complaint. They do offer a hot breakfast for room service but it's quite pricey. Would also like to see just some simple salads and sandwiches on the room service menu. All in all, a great stay and would reccommend it to others in a heartbeat!

<Content>Great Location and very clean I stayed at the Orchard on the first two nights of our road trip around California. We are both 28 and from England.I parked up at the Stockton sutter garage which is a stones throw away from the hotel and only cost about $45 for two days. I believe the valet car parking at the Orchard was $34 per day. The Stockton garage doesn't have in/out priviledges but you don't really need a car to see most of San Francisco.The location is excellent as you are one block away from Union Sq. 50yds from the entrance to the hotel is a cable car stop along with Roxannes who do a reasonably cheap and tasty breakfast. The rooms were very clean and had coffee and tea facilities which has seemed to be a rarity on our trip (the four diamond Venetian at Vegas didn't have a kettle!) The bathroom was spacious with a good powerful shower and a deep bath.I'd certainly recommend this hotel to anybody visiting San Francisco and wanting a good central location.

<Content>Location, staff and rooms - all grerat Little bad to say about experience at the Orchard. We booked a junior suite which was perfect for two adults and two children. The bathroom was huge although the toilet was not separate from the bathroom. The master bed was vast and very very comfortable with crisp white linen changed daily. The rooms were wonderfully clean, and although new had some small signs of wear. (E.g. Marked wallpaper behind chairs). There was no noise from neighbouring rooms.Its location is outstanding yards from the cable car and the Union square shopping districtThe check in staff and concierge were good and helped with restaurant bookings and recommendations. However I got the sense that they were doing this as a favour to us, rather then because they were a full-service front desk. (I guess this is the difference between a $200 and a $400 per night hotel)Continental breakfast was expensive from what it was, but it was convenient. Most guests seem to eat elsewhere.Overall, a great experience comparable to a $400 per night hotel鈥?/p>

<Content>The Orchard is a great place to stay! My husband and I stayed at The Orchard from the 22nd to the 27th of March. We had a great time! The hotel staff were very friendly and checked us in quickly. The room (a double) was very clean with a big bathroom and free internet. Most of the things we wanted to see were within walking distance but if you need transportation you can catch a bus within one block, a cable car in four or five (easy downhill walk), and taxis were always passing in front of the hotel. Our recommendations for eating: Sears Fine Food for breakfast, just around the corner on Stockton street. There's always a line outside the door but it moves quickly. Try the 18 little pancakes or the light and crispy waffles. Trattoria Contadina has excellent Italian food. I've never tasted such delicious homemade fettucini! And the bruschetta appetizer was amazing!For Indian food try New Dheli over on Post St. I think they close between 2 and 5 so get there early for lunch.If you go to opentable.com you can make restaurant reservations on line which I'd highly recommend as most places are very busy.I could go on and on about the food and the sights! We truly left a piece of our hearts there! Hope you find this review helpful you lucky San Francisco travelers!

<Content>Great location, great price A good place to stay in the city: Clean room, really comfortable bed and big bathroom (no bath, but double size shower), quiet (non view room), in room safe that fits a laptop, free fast internet, friendly staff and a good supply of fresh fruit in reception. Didn't eat in the hotel restaurant, but you couldn't choose a better location in the city for getting around to major transport links, sites, and restaurants.Also had a look at their sister hotel (Orchard Garden) which is close by and also looks good, with a slightly more modern flavor to the place.

<Content>Good location/rooms Spend four nights here during March. Taxi from airport was a little uncertain of the hotel's location which was surprising considering how central it is. Perhaps it does not have the same exposure as some of the bigger names in the area. Best thing about this hotel is location and bedrooms. First impressions of the hotel were a little unsure as the entrance and reception areas are simple. However, the bedrooms are very spacious and comfortable as are the bathrooms. Free wifi was also a pleasant surprise. Breakfast included in the rate is simple enough but adequate. Location is just off Union Square which is very central. Only problem is the steep hills around this area! Street cable car stops on the corner and a taxi trip to most of the city is about $10 per trip which is a bargain. Street cable car is expensive at $5 per journey per person if there are a few people so taxis are much better option. Would recommend this hotel for location and bedrooms but it does lack the public areas of some neighbouring hotels.

<Content>Great hotel Lovely hotel and excellent location. It is 50 yards from the cable car stop and just 2 blocks from Union Square. The room was quiet, spacious enough and a nice bathroom. The buffet breakfast was more than adequate. There is a Catholic church about 5 minutes walk from the hotel on the same street. The Starlight lounge is just around the corner. The hotel staff were very courteous and helpful. There is a laptop at the reception desk for checking your emails. They offer a car to transfer you to the airport for 45 dollars. Normal taxi is approximately 36 dollars. Nothing negative to say about hotel and really enjoyed my stay.

<Content>Excellent Experience! Based on trip advisor reviews (the Orchard was in the top 20 places to stay) and accessing the hotel website we decided to stay at the Orchard Hotel during the March Break (Canadian for Spring Break). While booking accommodations I was impressed with the professionalism and friendliness of the person I spoke with and they promised me that all our requests would be met which included adjoining rooms (family of 4), a room on a higher floor, mattress toppers, extra pillows and towels. Checking in was a pleasure; front desk staff were extremely friendly, professional and FAST! I was amazed that all requests were on file and I was assured that our rooms were ready with everything we needed. True to their word ALL requests were carried out. I have never had this happen ever!!!!!!!! Both concierges provided several excellent restaurant recommendations, they helped us with directions and gave great advice. Their services were invaluable to us. The rooms were spotlessly clean, towels are thick and large, shower is great, no noise from hallway or next door, beds were super comfortable with mattress toppers (make sure to request them). We experienced everything you could ask for and more. Midweek prices for rooms are extremely reasonable when considering this is downtown San Francisco and other hotels are twice the price. You get bargain prices for a top quality room and service!

<Content>a gentle stay the first impression was slightly dissapointing, not as glitsy as the website portrayed and the staff were very busy.However, after the first day the staff were attentive and I saw past the very ordinary facade of this little gem of a hotel. I t is situated beautifully for sightseeing by cable car and walking to the stores. Breakfast is a little monotinous but good food.Watchout for the confusing booking proceedure that myself and a few other guests fell into. We thought we had payed for our stay but had only reserved our room. 1 poor guest had to borrow money to pay the bill.

<Content>Loved the Orchard Had a great time at the hotel. I can't believe how quiet it was. I couldn't hear a sound from any of the other rooms. The only slight negative was using the wifi internet. The connection was a little slow to connect at times. The hotel directions said to configure the computer to automatically obtain an IP address. I have a Mac and don't know what that means. Maybe that was my problem. But besides this, it was a wonderful stay. Everyone was very friendly.

<Content>Lovely and comfortable boutique hotel I do a fair amount of business travel, and I really loved this hotel. There was none of that desolate, lonely feeling that you get from a lot of the chains. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the beds had digital thermostats and big, squishy comforters and pillows. There is a DVD player in your room and the front desk has DVDs you can borrow for free. Not to be missed: the crazily soft bathrobes in the closet. Man, I loved lounging around in that thing. As a business traveler, I felt the desk area could have had more electrical outlets; I had things charging all over the room. I hope I didn't forget any of them. Also, I had some minor trouble with the free wi-fi, though my company-issued laptop may have been at fault, and I always got connected in the end. Oh, and the mini-bar was so crowded with hideously expensive ($2.50 for a can of soda!) stuff that I could barely fit in my leftovers from dinner. Still, this is the hotel I'll be staying when in SF on someone else's dime.

<Content>Nice staff and Convenient Location We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here--we were tempted by its sister hotel too: The Orchard Garden (two blocks down Bush Street). The staff was extremely friendly; the rooms were large. We found the location very convenient: a walk down the hill to Union Square area; a walk down the other hill to Chinatown/Financial District; a walk up the hill to some amazing views. Union Square at night did not seem to be the safest area, especially as one gets closer to the 'Tenderloin' District; but the hotel was on a safe street and I was extremely pleased with our stay!

<Content>Boutique value in heart of SF Stayed here for just 1 night for a business trip, and found it through other user's reviews on Trip Advisor. They were right.....I thought this was a great bargain for a boutique hotel right in the heart of San Francisco. Large bathroom with nice tile work, large stall shower. The style, the location, and the price all added up to a good experience. Two complaints though: the bed, although not uncomfortable, was a little lumpy. There's no box spring, just the mattress.And the free WiFi never actually worked for me. I couldn't connect. My colleague didn't have any trouble, so maybe it was me. But that was a little annoying.And the restaurant in the lobby was nice as well. Overall it was a good experience, and I'd recommend for business travel.

<Content>Pleasant Orchard A girl friend and I stayed for 5 nights in March at The Orchard Hotel towards the end of a lovely 2 month holiday and had a very pleasant and comfortable stay at The Orchard Hotel. We arrived at 8.00pm and were very quickly checked in and in our room which was spacious and light. We had a 3rd Floor room on the corner of the building and experienced a small degree of noise from the traffic and early morning rubbish collectors but nothing that kept us awake.We had a room with 2 beds as requested and had a very spacious bathroom with a walk in shower but no bath. It was our impression that this could have been a room adapted for the disabled as there were several grab rails but these were not obtrusive. Breakfast was served in the restaurant off the small lobby and the buffet available was simple with a choice of some fruit, juice, bread, scones (delicious) cheese, ham and boiled eggs and croissants. Cooked meals were not available and this would have been a nice option but presumably, our tariff would have reflected this addition should it have been available. The position of the Hotel couldn't really have been better for us,extremely close to the Tram Stop and walkable to Union Square which was a couple of blocks away. Reception and Door staff were always friendly and informative and ensured we had a pleasant few days in the lovely city of SF.

<Content>Everything more than Perfect! I got to be a really good fan of Trip Advisor. We were looking for a hotel with the right combination of good location and price. We stayed at the Orchard and it exceeded our expectations. They were able to give us an really early check in. They were waiting for us and new about our room preferences. Everybody from the bell boy, front desk and the maids were more than eagar to help and always with a nice smile. Gave us great suggestions for dinner too! No doubt we will go back next time we visit SFO

<Content>a gem -want to go back We stayed here for 2 nights to break up our return journey to uk from nz. We arrived about 11.00 and were able to check in straight away. The staff could not have been more helpful. Yes it is a business hotel bu we felt right at home.The bar manager was very friendly and came over to the table where we ate prior to the theatre to make sure we were ok. Advice on restaurants was given; the proximity to cable cars, shops and touristy things was fantastic.

<Content>Nice Hotel in Great Location Very nice hotel in perfect location. It is right at the intersection of Union Square, Nob Hill and Chinatown. Great shops and food all around. Perfect for walking anywhere in the city. Nice size rooms and comfy beds. We had a room at the front of the hotel so we could hear the cable car go by...we loved it but if that bothers you request a room at the back of the building.

<Content>Bit too corporate Nice hotel in the centre of San Francisco but a bit too corporate/old school for us.Room was clean and of a good size with a great mini bar, probably the best we have seen for a while and not just focussed on drink!!!Bar is ok, although dated and lack of a cooked breakfast in this area seemed strange.Overall it was ok but there are better in SF.

<Content>good location Three couples stayed two nights for birthday celebration. Hotel allowed early check-in/out which helped with our travel plans. Rooms are nice, although pretty standard, and nothing too special. Didn't like the bed, no box spring, on a platform. The location is great, walking distance to everything. Overall the staff was very friendly. Except that on arrival, the man didn't really have anything to offer with simple questions about local lunch spot, transportation or a timeframe to meet an activity. Said he'd have to think about it... He just seemed to not care. Didn't run into him again all weekend. Would stay again, but book via web for better rate.

<Content>Highly recomend the Orchard Hotel! The Orchard is the perfect little boutique hotel! Super friendly and accommodating. Room and bathroom were very clean and bed was comfortable. We did not eat at the hotel so we cannot speak for the food quality or room service - but it is available. Doorman was always offering help to catch a cab or directions and recommendations for restaurants or shopping in the area. The location of this hotel is absolutely perfect! It is located just 2 blocks up from Union Square where there is TONS of shopping and about a 20/30 minutes walk to the Wharf and Pier 39. The walk to the popular Wharf and Pier 39 will take you thru China Town and Washington Square - areas where you will find lots to look at and cool places to eat! I would highly recommend this hotel and will be re-visiting it in the future!

<Content>Had a great stay at the Orchard Hotel My husband and I chose the Orchard Hotel mostly for its location but also taking into account its price and overall look. We couldn't have been more pleased! We were in town for a wedding which took place just up the hill (2 blocks - not too bad) at the University Club. Friends stayed across the street from the Club at the Mark Hopkins. The rates were the same as the Orchard (because the wedding had a rate), but we were glad with our choice at the Orchard. saw a room at the Mark and although it was a corner room, it was no bigger and no better appointed than our room at the Orchard. Our room was clean, well apointed with fridge and every bath amenity. Would definately stay at this Hotel (or the Orchard Garden a couple blocks down the hill). Loved it.

<Content>This is excellent botique hotel located right on the cable car line I needed to stay in San Francisco for 7 weeks during weekdays. I enjoyed this hotel very much. The staff was friendly and made me feel welcome. The hotel was located within two or three blocks of Nob Hill , China Town and Union Square Shopping in a upscale area of San Francisco.The hotel is located right on the Powell cable car line that runs between Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf. A lot of wonderful restaurants of every culture are located in easy walking distance. It is only one block to the French Quarter and Two blocks to the entrance to China Town.

<Content>Orchard was good, not great The Orchard worked out very well for my trip. The location is convenient, the staff were incredibly polite and friendly.Three negatives:1) The wireless network worked sporadically. When I called for support the technicians were not helpful.2) I ordered room service one night and the photocopied menu pages in my room were not accurate, the restaurant did not have the things that were no the menu.3) The exercise room was unusually small and underequippedOverall the hotel was clean and comfortable. Definitely a decent place to stay in Union Square.

<Content>Comfortable, reasonable, little hotel for business travellers I found the hotel well located, comfortable, and clean with friendly, helpful, professional staff. The wireless internet access worked well and my car parked and returned promptly. Easy access to restaurants and shopping.Was a little annoyed by the Club One fitness center pass which was only valid for one calendar day. In other words, I would need to purchase two $15 passes for my 24 hour stay. Lack of easy access to a fitness center would be my only reason for not returning to this otherwise excellent little San Francisco hotel.

<Content>very nice and soooo quiet A very comfortable and quiet room. It is only a few blocks to Union Square. I would skip the breakfast and go to one of the local restaurants where you can get a delicious hot meal instead of muffins and fruit. All in all it was a great place and I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>The Greenest Jewel The Orchard Hotel is a stunning oasis on San Francisco鈥檚 Union Square. Conveniently located near the cable car lines and centrally situated for easy access to all city destinations, its ambiance is unmatched. The Orchard Hotel is the greenest jewel in the city鈥檚 boutique hotel crown. The accommodations are exquisite, the attentiveness of the staff exceeded our expectations and the room was flawless. I strongly recommend staying at the Orchard Hotel for a night in the city, or an extended stay. When visiting San Francisco on business or pleasure, be sure to select the Orchard Hotel as your home away from home.

<Content>Good Hotel-Steep Hills I spent two nights (Feb. 3  4) at the Orchard Hotel. Hotel was nice, rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff was very friendly and quickly answered questions. The only drawbacks were that the hotel is up a couple of steep hills, which are a natural part of San Francisco. I would discourage anyone with any challenges walking uphill to stay here. Otherwise, it was a good experience. Second, I asked about half day rates as I had a red-eye flight that night. Half day rates here are only until 4:00 p.m., not 6:00 p.m. as in some other hotels. If you are flying west to east on a night flight this might be a deterrent. Enjoy otherwise.

<Content>Very pleasant stay at the Orchard Stayed three nights in late January. Staff very friendly and accommodating to requests. Nice room with bay window view of the cable cars and the Mark Hopkins Hotel.Location perfect for using public transportation (cable cars) and for shopping in and around Union Square. Restaurant staff also very friendly; ate there twice: one night food was just so, so but the last night it was very tasty with excellent service.I'd stay again!

<Content>Good Location My finance  I stayed 1 night at the Orchard Hotel. We didn't think it was the nicest hotel we've stayed in. The only few good things was the location, the room size  the staff were very friendly. The bed was as hard as a rock  the shower was dirty. It took us 2 calls to downstairs for them to give us the correct password to get the free internet access to work. Once we got the correct password, it worked fine.

<Content>Had a Great stay My friend and I were on the west coast for business and extended our stay in San Fran for 3 days. We had a great spacious room with comfortable beds on the 10th floor. Our room was very clean and loved our spacious bathroom. I had read that hotels in San Fran had small rooms, but was pleasantly surprised when we arrived to find that we had a nice sized room. The lobby was very nice and the resturant/lounge looked nice as well. Staff was eager to help with directions and pointed us in the right direction to find shopping, eating and nightlife. we were only a couple of blocks from the heart of Union Square. I will definately stay with the Orchard Hotel again.

<Content>Good location and great value for SF We picked the Orchard after reading all the reviews on TripAdvisor, and it met our expectations for a centrally located hotel in a safe area of SF. As a boutique hotel, it doesn't have a lot of amenities, but if you're just looking for a comfortable room, this works great. The room and bathroom were large for the city, and we really appreciated the free internet and DVD rentals they offer. We did find the walls were a little thin, and had a problem with noisyneighbors up late talking, coming/going down the hall after midnight.But after a call to the front desk, the problem was resolved and we never had another issue the rest of our 4 night stay. The staff was very professional and always helpful.

<Content>Nice boutique hotel in good location Nicely located hotel just up the hill from union square. It's a boutique but seems to have a lot of services of a larger hotel (never a problem getting a cab, arranged my taxi back to the airport w/o a hitch). the rooms were a good deal i thought ($200 something for a king room w/separate sitting/desk area), free wireless and a good, included, breakfast buffet. the furnishings seemed a little out of place (traditional when i think of boutique as more hip) but the bathrooms were huge and overall i had a great stay. I've recommended it to others and they have stayed and enjoyed.

<Content>Excellent location Stayed here for 2 nights from 26th -28th December $189 per night. Really pleased with the location as close to all the shops and Union Square. It is on Bush Street, just off Powell Street where there is a Cable Car stop. You can buy your Day travel card $11 from Walgreen across the street ($5 single journeys on Cable cars).We got the BART from the airport for $5 each, and decided to walk uphill up Powell Street (10 mins) which was fine until we reached the last block which was really steep pulling our bags!Extrememly welcoming at the Front desk and they also gave us a room on one of the top floors as we'd requested to have it quieter. We could still hear the morning noise from the street, but it is a city location!Fairly large room with large bathroom, not so soft toilet paper though. Shower over shallow bath was fine, always hot water. Very large comfortable bed.There's free internet on a laptop in the reception.Free USA Today newspaper in the morning outside your room.There are a couple of diners within one block. It was also only about 3 blocks from Avis car hire - we booked a car online from the UK for only 拢36 (GBP) for 24 hours one way.We booked our trip to Alcatraz online before we went which is worth doing. We went for the 5:15pm departure (took a tram to Pier 33) as the evening ones were recommended. However I think if you went earlier in the day you might be able to look round the grounds too. We also didn't have time to attend the talk on Escapes which was a shame.The Cable Car musuem is worth a visit - free entry.

<Content>Wonderful Stay Staying at The Orchard was terrific. Some people have cited the room size as a concern; me and my wife differ. The room size was an average hotel room size; it was not noticeably small at all.The linens were great, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and spotless. The Orchard is located in a great, safe, central area, a mere 5-minute walk down hill to Union Square.The curtains were particularly spectacular turning 3 p.m. sunshine into an 11 p.m. nap time setting, so if you're coming from the East Coast and need a quick nap, you can do it here ... no problem!The only slight issue I'd knock is the breakfast. The Orchard offers what most other SF hotels offer -- a continental fare -- but perhaps I'm biased because I like to start my day with a big, protein-heavy breakfast. All in all, we stayed for three nights before moving to another hotel, and we enjoyed The Orchard a lot. They let us check in very early after we explained we flew in from the East Coast and really had no control over the time!

<Content>Well located, pricing was good value and room was bigger than postage stamp We stayed at this hotel the Friday before New Years and stayed until the day after New Years...and had a very nice stay. The hotel is not fancy...it is not the Four Seasons but it also doesn't have the price tag of the Four Season's either. It seems to be a newer hotel...doesn't have that musty smell that some of the older hotels have...and is small without being too small. We had a huge bathroom...and the Aveda products were also a nice touch especially considering we forgot to bring some of our travel products. Also the front desk was very helpful....including keeping our bags for us and arranging a shuttle for the airport on short notice. The location was great! The Powell trolly runs right past and we could hear the cute little ding of the trolly car without it getting too annoying and being noisy. In fact- after reading some of the reviews I was some what nervous about noise level...but we heard nothing...not the garbage truck (that another reviwer had heard at 4am) or any of our other neighbors. It was fun being so close to everything in Union Square...espeically with New Years eve happening...it was very conviently located to everything we wanted to do. Also- there is a great little cafe located on the corner of Powell and Bush that was nice for breakfast. :)

<Content>The Perfect SF Getaway Having lived in SF for 10 years, I tend to be pretty hard on the hotels there. On the whole, they are overpriced (tho often glamourous) and you always have to pay some exorbitant fee for parking when you arrive from out of town. The Orchard changes all my thinking.Just off Union Square, this boutique property has all of the amenities (and then some) of the larger properties just up the hill (i.e. Fairmont, Mark Hopkins) without the price tag and snooty staff. The lobby is tiny but nice and upon check-in, the staff was phenomenally kind. While the room was a tad small, it's not much smaller than a standard SF room elsewhere and as there were only 2 of us, it's not like we needed a suite!The bed and pillows were wonderful and the beds had DUVETS (which I'm an enormous fan of -- DOWN with those gross bacteria-filled coverlets!). There were spa robes in the closet for each of us (tho, one of them was starting to come apart a little at the belt loop) and the bathroom was extremely spacious and well-appointed with Aveda products and fluffy towels.The hotel provides DVDs for in-room use and has a pretty expansive library of new releases and classics. The staff is so helpful that when my boyfriend and I rolled in at around 1 a.m. in NEED of some late-night food, we were directed immediately to a diner up the street which satisfied our cravings. The location is fantastic and you can walk to everything (Chinatown, shopping, restaurants, bars). North Beach was a minimal $5 cab ride away.Despite having a view of another building (the standard view in a big city), the hotel was VERY VERY quiet. Our parking was taken care of by parking in the Sutter-Stockton garage merely 1 block away on Bush. The hotel only has valet and charges $34 overnite, but if you arrive on a Saturday after 6 and leave on Sunday any time after 7 a.m., the fee is only $15.I am thrilled to have discovered this fantastic little hotel (thank you, TripAdvisor!) and I know we will return.

<Content>Hoped for more I went on Orbitz.com to book the hotel and was quite excited after reading the reviews and seeing pictures of the hotel. Arrival and check in was a breeze but the room was not what I expected. The bed was terribly uncomfortable, the room was small, and the view was terrible. It's very close to the action, but next time I will spend a couple extra bucks to stay somewhere I know I will enjoy.

<Content>Our new favorite in San Francisco We have now had our second success using the guidance of others who have reviewed hotels on Tripadvisor. This past summer we stayed at the Casablanca in NY and were very pleased with our choice then as well. The Orchard is a wonderful value especially as we live just an hour or so from San Francisco and when we do stay over we rather not go overboard on price for a hotel. We really couldn't have been more pleased with the Orchard. The rooms are good size, especially for San Francisco; they were clean and the bathrooms were clean and large as well. Lovely bathrobes and Aveda products add to the comfort. The staff was kind, friendly and helpful. Eating at the Daffodil (the restaurant in the hotel) for dinner (it's only a few months old) was an unexpected delight. The food was excellent, service outstanding, just sad that there weren't more people eating there. We had opted not to include the breakfast with our reservation and found that Roxanne, the little restaurant next door was fabulous for breakfast. Next stay in the city we will probably try the Orchard Garden, which is the Orchard's sister hotel. It's just a block or so away and looks lovely on their web-site. If not, we will definitely be returning to the Orchard.

<Content>Perfect Location - Loved everything This was the perfect location for us. The rooms were very clean and the beds were amazingly comfortable. Breakfast was provided with everything from pastries to waffles to ham and eggs. Chinatown was only a couple of blocks away as was the streetcar stop and any kind of shopping you could want. The staff was very helpful and gave us advise about how to get around as well as what to see and how to get there. We will always stay at the Orchard when we visit San Francisco.

<Content>Great Romantic Getaway What a great surprise! The hotel is right in the middle of town, 2 blocks from Union Square, and right next to the trolley cars. The staff was friendly and very helpful with directions. The room was lovely and they carried Aveda bath products! Great price for a nice getaway!

<Content>Excellent Staffs  We are a family of 4 from Asia and stayed here for three nights in December 17 on our final leg of our USA vacation to see some sights and do some shopping. Due to unavailability of our preferred hotel, we decided to book into this hotel on arrival day via the hotel web site for a King Suite. The location couldn't be better just a few blocks uphill from Union Square...The nicest experience we had in this hotel was actually the front desk, door service and housekeeping staffs. They are very friendly, efficient and responsive to any request. Coming from Asia where we pride our service quality standards, I must say the service excellent  deliverable quality of the hotel met expectation!

<Content>Another great stay at The Orchard We just finished our second stay at The Orchard and everything was great. The staff is helpful, the location is perfect. The breakfast has something for everyone. Parking is very expensive, but comparable to other SF hotels. It's now our place to stay when in the city.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel This is a very nice, clean hotel in a good location. The bellman and front desk staff were very friendly and responsive (except a hint of trepidation when I asked for an extra hour at checkout).Need a taxi to go to a business appoitnment and the bellman had a limo (that I think was at the service of hotel guests) take me there...free of charge! I would definitely keep the Orchard on my short list of hotels to stay at in the Union Square vicinity.

<Content>loved it...except... i contacted the hotel directly after reading the great reviews here. i got a great rate. i arrived very early and my room was ready, all of my requests were granted (feather bed and high floor on a quiet street), the staff was great and the location amazing. it was all a 10++ and i was so excited that i found this gem. THEN...at 4:30 a.m. i was awakened to the invasive sound of loud trash trucks which continued for a half an hour. i called the front desk to complain and i was told the trucks come every morning on both sides of the hotel property at 4:30. i repeated this complaint to the front desk at check out and was told the same thing. how can people function after a night of that kind of sleep? i am so sad to say that i can never return because of the interruption of sleep that is sure to occur here.

<Content>great stay at the orchard hotel The Orchard Hotel was great. Close proximity to several attractions. Staff was friendly and gracious. Rooms were very nice, with good sized bathrooms. Would recommend. Only downside was no onsite parking, but only a block away, so not a big deal.

<Content>Nice Hotel, but not worth the money My experience with this hotel was not all that great. I paid a lot of money only to listen to a party in the lounge (on the first floor) in my room on the 5th floor. After a long day, I was exhausted and at midnight the party downstairs was still going strong. I felt sorry for the people who had rooms on floors 2, 3  4!! The hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly. Thank goodness the lounge manager was nice and quick with our drinks! The man at the front desk tried very hard for about 20 minutes to get us reservations for dinner somewhere close, but he could not. We ended up walking about 15 feet outside the hotel door and found a wonderful Italian resturant that was completely empty!! Yumm. The valet service that was included in my room price I thought would be great, except that the valet was nowhere to be found when I arrived. My car had to be double parked on the street for about 15 minutes while the front desk checked me in - very slow. I finally convinced someone to call the valet to come and park the car and was then told that the hotel was very busy for the evening and the next day and that for the unlimited in and out service that I paid for I would need to be sure to give them at least 1/2 hour each time. I could have gotten a decent hotel room for a lot less, but this hotel came recommended by a relative and the website looked fantastic. I guess I have learned my lesson.

<Content>We live in SF and just came home from a great weekend at the Orchard We decided to treat our family of 4 with a weekend get away downtown for shopping and dining and relaxation. We have small children, ages 5 and 7, and the whole family looked forward to this weekend with great anticipation. We dined at the Tonga Room and Mortons, we shopped, we saw the tree lit up in Union Square, and we had a fabulous time at the Orchard Hotel. We stayed in the king suite on the 5th floor, with its yellow stripedy walls, and huge bathroom, and TWO tvs for a family that doesn't always want to watch the Backyardigans or CNN together. Actually, yesterday afternoon we watched Hairspray on the hotel DVD player. We took the cable car (the stop is right outside the hotel) over the hill to Fishemen's Wharf yesterday morning and then came back for lunch at Le Central before taking a nap Saturday afternoon. The room was spacious and clean, and very quiet especially given its location right in the middle of downtown. It was so nice to be tourists in our own city. The price at the Orchard can't be beat, and since it is such a great hotel we won't be going to any other hotels for the next family weekend get away.

<Content>Just Okay When I saw this hotel rated #2 on Trip Advisor in the entire city of San Francisco, I decided to give it a try. The quick verdict: having spent perhaps 50 nights in San Francisco in the past five years, there is no way this hotel even comes close to its rating.The pluses: very friendly, courteous staff; excellent service; clean rooms; nice location within walking distance of Union Square; very nice dining room with outstanding food.The minuses: the bed is way too hard and mattress quality (especially in this day and age of Heavenly Beds and their competitors) is poor; TV's have not been updated with the new plasma-type sets; the hotel does not offer any views of one of the most beautiful cities in America; the room was noisy--we heard the garbage trucks working at 4am; lobby is small and underwhelming.All in all, The Orchard isn't a complete bust, but you can do much better for the price elsewhere.

<Content>Fantastic! We just returned from San Francisco. We LOVED this hotel. It has a fantastic location, nice staff, is clean and has very nice rooms. We stayed for four nights and loved everything about the hotel. We have no complaints and highly recommend the Orchard! It is a great price! And, is a lovely, smaller option that has character. We decided to try it based on reviews on this site and were not disappointed at all. We would definitely stay there again and recommend the hotel to friends and family.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at The Orchard for a three nights stopover on our way home to UK from Hawaii in November. The location was superb with easy access to Union Square - and the cable car stop on the corner took us to Fishermans Wharf and the departure pier to Alcatraz,The hotel has been refurbished to a high standard - our room was spacious, nicely furnished and well equipped including modern bathroom, bath robes, room safe, mini bar etc etc.We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning which was normal buffet style and dinner one night which was very good. The staff were very friendly and helpful and all in all this was a very pleaseant stay in a nice hotel. We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a top quality short stay.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel  We stayed at the Orchard Hotel for the Thanksgiving weekend and we are SOOO glad we did. Every request we made when booking the room was met: pillowtop mattress, street view, high floor, early check-in - no problem!!The hotel location was terrific, near Union Square and safe, plus the cable car stops right outside the hotel. The hotel staff was outstanding, from the front desk to the door staff to the cleaning crew. Everyone was very friendly and accomodating. The rooms were quiet, clean and the bed (with pillowtop mattress) was SOOO comfortable!! The breakfast was suprisingly fresh and very good, although I would have liked a little more variety over our 4 day stay. Overall the Orchard Hotel gets 2 thumbs up!!

<Content>Great location, quiet room We stayed at the Orchard Hotel the night after Thanksgiving and enjoyed the hotel and location. I used to live in SF for 15 years, but moved to So Cal, so it was interesting and fun being a tourist in a city I know. I knew the location of the hotel would be walking distance to China Town, shops in Union Square, Embarcadero shopping, cable car riding, and taxi pick ups. The hotel is worth staying at if you want to be close to all these. The room was clean, roomy, quiet (faced back, not Bush Street) and stylish. Good shower, basic buffet breakfast and friendly customer service at front desk. Free laptop use at front desk (if you don't need to print anything). I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Made our stay I travel a lot for business and pleasure. This time instead of staying at the conference hotel I opted for a smaller property. My husband and I loved it. The staff was very helpful, the resturant was excellent, the room was great and the bed was extra lush and comfortable. They have a fellow property which has a pre-fixed early dining menu that offered full size portions of excellent cuisine. Outside the door was the cable car and within a few blocks was China town and down the hill (a few blocks) was the big shopping area...think NYC (where I am from) and Rodeo Drive in LA. Everything they advertised on their website was acurate and in reality it was even nicer. I always review trip advisor on properties before I book, and this was a good one. I would definitely stay there again and recommend the hotel to others.

<Content>Great Find in SF Located right around the corner from popular Union Square, the Orchard Hotel offers excellent boutique accommodations at a very good price. We brought our family of 4 there and got a suite. The kids slept in the parlor on the sofabed and we had our own bedroom.The location is ideal. It is adjacent to the shops and restaurants of Union Square and the Powell cable car, and a modest walk to North Beach, the Metreon, and Financial District. Most other places are a quick cab ride away.We found the rooms to be very clean, surpisingly large for the city and modern. The service was often excellent and friendly (e.g. good advice on places to eat, free DVDs, free umbrellas, late check out, valet parking, etc.)Highlights of our trip included an incredibly tasty dinner at Town Hall in SOMA, visit to kid's interactive museum called Zeum, and a trip to Alcatraz. We watched a movie from the hotel's collection, Escape from Alcatraz with Clint Eastwood, the evening after visiting the Rock and recognized a lot of things from our tour.

<Content>surpassed expectations I cannot think of anything I would change about this hotel -- the rooms were spacious and the bathroom was large -- we also got lovely robes !! The beds were twin , but larger and very comfortable... the continental breakfast included meats and cheeses as well as hard boiled eggs... the staff was friendly and very accomodating -- we had a great stay and I look forward to visiting again!!

<Content>Great visit, great location. My husband and I stayed at The Orchard Hotel with our English relatives for seven days in November 2007. We were all very satisfied with our stay. From our arrival through our departure, all of the staff was helpful, friendly and polite. We were always greeted with kind smiles.The hotel itself is in a great location. It is very convenient to Union Square shopping, public transportation, and all kinds of restaurants. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable.We will definitely stay at The Orchard Hotel when we return to San Francisco.

<Content>The Orchard met our expectations The Orchard is a charming small hotel in an excellent central location. Although I would not go so far as to qualify it as romantic (it's on a most romantic hotels list), there were many nice touches in the Art Deco design of both the Lobby and our room. We had a suite on the fifth floor which was nicely furnished. The huge bathroom included a separate tub and shower stall. The bed was comfortable and the robes and slippers were a nice touch. The minibar was well stocked, including a respectable bottle of wine. We were on the fifth floor but still had a lot of noise from the traffic. What we appreciated most was the location. From the hotel we were able to walk to Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square, Chinatown, and North Beach as well as two high end restaurants.. It's about 6 blocks from buses and trolleys that get you to most parts of the city. The staff was very friendly and if the desk clerk didn't have information we needed, the doorman did. On the one occasion that we needed a taxi, the doorman arranged for a private car that charged taxi prices. In the hotel restaurant, the cold buffet breakfast (only option) was pricey at $14. but the small plates dinner menu is worth having if you don't want to go out. We travel a lot and prefer to stay in small, interesting hotels. The orchard was not our most memorable but was quite satisfactory.

<Content>Overall Good Hotel Stayed at the Orchard Hotel during the weekend of November 10. The hotel is overall nice and I would stay there again, however, it is not quite deserving of the exceedingly high ranking that it receives on Tripadvisor. It is a solid 3+ star hotel that is clean and serves the purpose desired when in SF, meaning, it is convenient to public transportation and close to an attraction (Union Square). Free internet is nice as well.I would opt out of the hotel breakfast and eat at Sears Fine Foods which is 2 blocks away and is a SF landmark. Alternatively, you can eat at one of the many nearby cafes which have larger selections and lower prices. The person that checked us in was somewhat abrasive, however, after that the staff was courteous and we enjoyed all our other encounters with them. The housekeeping staff was a little odd, like not picking up the robes and knocking on doors at 9:00 a.m. But this was a minor issue. Doorman was very pleasant and served as a concierge as well.

<Content>Nice , low-key , clean and friendly Like everything price is a huge consideration @ $169 + tax this was great during ORACLE Convention where crap hotels were trying to charge $400. This place includes breakfast, free internet and with overnight parking down the street at the sutter stockton garage @ $25 for over night rather than the $36 valet charges, this is a great place. Nothing fancy but for location and price these hotels are great

<Content>Very happy with our stay at The Orchard Hotel This was my first trip to San Francisco and my husband and I couldn't have chosen a better place to stay. We arrived on a Saturday, early afternoon, before the official check-in time expecting to have to leave our bags. However, they had a room available and we were able to check-in right away. The customer service was excellent. Everything was explained to us when we checked-in, they provided us with computer cable for internet access without having to ask, and they pointed out the movies available for rental at the front desk. The door man was helpful and polite throughout our stay with our bags, directions or anything we needed.Our room was perfect for our needs - nicer linens and comforters and an updated bathroom. I thought the bed was cozy enough, but my husband (who is a bit pickier than I) thought it wasn't comfortable. Overall, everything was clean and up-to-date. The breakfast was served buffet style with a good selection of food: muffins, croissants, ham and cheese, tea, hard-boiled eggs, toast. The food was not special but definitely sufficient and the atmosphere was pleasant.Overall, I think this hotel was a great value for the money and I鈥檇 definitely stay there again. It鈥檚 not extraordinary; no doubt there are far more posh hotels in the area. But the Orchard is a very clean, comfortable, well-run hotel in a great location for anyone looking to explore downtown San Francisco.

<Content>great boutique hotel stayed 5 days here. great location - 1 block from union square shops, restaurants etc and the cable car stopped virtually outside the hotel.very clean superior room, well stocked minibar and plenty of storage space. free continental breakfast was very good, though the individual croissants could feed a family of 4. good selection fruits, cheese and ham. was about to book through hotel web site, but ebookers was 拢60 cheaper - well worth shopping around.

<Content>Great hotel! Great staff! We had a bad experience at a hotel across the street from this one so we walked right over and asked to see one of the rooms at the Orchard. The hotel staff immediately took us up to see a room. We decided to switch over to the Orchard Hotel. The rooms were very nice, new and so clean. This is definitely where we will stay from now on when we are in San Fransisco.

<Content>Great experience! I rarely ever contribute to these reviews but wanted to pass along that I had a fabulous stay at this hotel and would highly recommend it. The staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and comfortable with a spacious bathroom. Bed was firm which is great for me. Room was pretty quiet given the downtown location. You can use the mini bar as a mini fridge and breakfast was included with my rate which was a plus. Location is great for both Union Square and the Financial District. I loved that they have DVD's available at the front desk with DVD players in all the rooms. And, the Aveda bath products are great. I travel a lot for work and would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Fantastic This was our first trip to San Francisco and northern California. We only stayed one night in San Francisco and picked the Orchard Hotel from recommendations from Trip Advisor. We were very pleased. The location was excellent (close to the cable cars.) The front desk staff was wonderful. The room was nicely appointed, and actually very quiet. The stereo sound system with sleep sound cd was a nice touch. The room included a delicious complementary breakfast buffet in an elegant setting. With a AAA discount, rate of $180 was a bargain! Parking with valet was $35 for 24 hours, which was fair for the city. We will definitely stay here again.

<Content>The Rock!! The hotel is very nice. Its also in a fantastic location in San Francisco. We were however very disappointed in the quality of the mattress. We stayed here four nights-by the end of the trip my back was hurting!! I really would expect a better mattress than a rock (the mattresses in Alcatraz were more comfy than the hotel)!! The pillow was very nice! The continental breakfast at the hotel was awful! It was cereal, cold muffins, croissants, and some fruits.

<Content>Pleasant Hotel in great location I find it very difficult to find anything to complain about from our stay here in late September. Found the rooms clean and comfortable, staff friendly and helpful and the location close to Union square very convenient - close by but without the noise you might expect. The only downside was that it is located on quite a steep hill, though I guess you cant blame the hotel for that - and cable cars pass by on a regular basis!They kept our bags free of charge after we checked out, also arranged transport to the airport.Will definately be our hotel of choice in San Francisco.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Our 3 day stay in mid October was terrific! Great Union Sq location, friendly + helpful staff. The rooms were spacious, clean, with comfortable king bed. Bathroom was well equipped with Aveda products. The breakfast was basic but very good. We arrived early 1200 but were able to check into our room, no problem. Recommend higher floor rooms on Bush St. We got a very good rate with AAA discount through the hotel website. I would strongly recommend this hotel and will stay here again when we return to SF.We took the BART from SFO for $5.15 one way, got off at Powell St station and walked (w/roller bags) to the hotel. We very easily used BART; buses; trolley; ferries to get around bay area during our stay. We traveled to Concord; Marin, Larkspur; Tiburon, Golden Gate park etc via public transportation. Parking is expensive and a car is not necessary. Also recommend renting a bike (Blazing Saddles - near Fishermans wharf) and ride through marina district, Presidio, over Golden Gate bridge, through Sausilito/Tiburon and take a ferry back from Sausilito or Tiburon, ride back to start. Restaurant/bar recommendations - The Nanking, Citizen Thai, Tommaso's, Tosca, Enrico's

<Content>Wonderful Place to Stay We stayed at the Orchard for a week in September. We had a beautiful suite on the tenth floor. It was a splurge, but it was great having two rooms. Huge bathroom. Walk in shower and also a bathtub. Free videos, with many choices. Local newspaper delivered to the room every weekday morning. We found that the staff was friendly and helpful- especially the doorman and the front desk.. The bed (even though people complained about them in previous reviews) was so much more than comfortable. The location was perfect. Within walking distance of Chinatown, North Beach and Union Square. Cable cars were a few feet away from the hotel鈥檚 front door. They were crowded most of the time but they were worth it when we got on (other times we took cabs for about the same amount that it would cost to take the cable car to the Wharf). We met friendly and interesting locals and tourists on every cable car trip. The restaurant re-opened while we were there, but we never had the time to eat there. We did, however, enjoy the bar a couple of times. The only negative was that the wine prices were sporadic. One day a glass of wine was one price and the next day the same wine was $3 less than before. We never made it to breakfast at the hotel. We slept in most mornings because it was so quiet (we faced Bush). It was great to have coffee service in the room; but we were only given one caffeinated coffee packet. The other ones were one decaf and two teas. We never said anything about it because we were so happy with everything else. You must have breakfast and an Irish coffee at the Buena Vista at the end of the cable car line near Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf. Wonderful!!! Sears Restaurant, down Powell, near Walgreens, was a great breakfast place also. Even though Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf is pretty commercial, we enjoyed Pier 39 (there were some nice restaurants there; try Pier Market), especially the sea lions. Alcatraz is a great half day trip. Sausalito was a great day trip by boat, too. When we left, the doorman recommended that we take the limo instead of a cab to the airport. It was only $12 more than a cab would have been and it was a perfect way to end our vacation. The next time we travel to San Francisco, we will definitely stay here again. Quiet, convenient, close to everything.

<Content>Great handy hotel Booked this hotel after reading the Trip Advisor reviews, and glad I did.Perfect location - few blocks up from main shopping area, three blocks from Chinatown, on main cable car route to Fishermans Wharf.Pleasant, large room with a huge comfy bed. The hotel website doesn't mention air con, but it does have climate control so had no issues (and I'm fussy about this!).Handy breakfast buffet to get you started - coffee, bagels, pastries, juices and fresh fruit. Door staff handy for getting taxis and booking shuttle back to the airport.LOVED San Francisco, can't wait to go back and will stay here again.

<Content>Everything it's supposed to be and then some... I just saw the new tripadvisor beta and it still doesnt give you a direct link to the rankings but anyway... i digress... stayed at this hotel because i only use tripadvisor and it was highly ranked. the omni is great too and you should use their kids room by pottery barn sometime...this hotel has a small staff but they do more than most big name brand hotels. the doorman was outstanding on both nights. the valet is $34 vs. $65 for the W or others, even the Omni. The car came in less than 10 minutes in most cases. they were very child friendly and got us a crib ($10) right away without even asking after they saw our 4 month old. we came in late after a very long day traveling with kids on a plane from LA and ordered room service. i could have eaten a shoe by that time, but it was EXCELLENT. my wife's spinach side was the best she ever had she said.the room is ample and not too frou frou but clean and good. not cool and sexy like a W like i like but that's so overplayed its nice to go the other direction. their hallways are small so you have nowhere to get lost. the elevator is quick. the visitors are mostly German for some reason. their bar later was great too. lots of small batch scotches and good stuff like that.the location cant be beat. you are literally 1.5 blocks from Macy's Union Square, Levi store, Cheesecake, Barney's and Neimans. Try the Neiman's bar - they rock too. Chinatown is just 2.5 blocks away and starbucks is right there at the entrance of Chinatown.what i dont like is their coffee setup in the room. too cumbersome and no way to not spill water on the counter. the shower has a plastic curtan too which is not great. it wasnt nasty, but they could do a nice tericloth and just wash it more and people would feel like its cleaner. also, it flooded our bath floor on both occasions.they have free dvd rental downstairs which is cool if you like that.all in all, another great find thanks to tripadvisor. btw, i am a big city guy doing reviews here. my buddy says all you tripadvisor reviewers are midwesterners -- not true. real travelers use this site exclusively and i am one of them. my only tip is to book at the HOTEL'S website only. You wont pre-pay and you get better terms and usually better pricing. i'd rather pay $10 or $25 more to get a free cancel opp the day before. Sorry tripadvisor but you should just put the hotel's link on your page even though i know its a way for you to make the buck$.

<Content>The staff is the problem. The staff is the real problem. They are all sullen, the doorman does not open doors, the front desk is decidedly not welcoming. The ice machine was inoperable on my floor and the solution presented by the front desk staff was to go to another floor to obtain ice. And the room cleaner knocked on my door at about 9AM and tried to get me to check out early so that she could clean the room.

<Content>Mixed review Check in was prompt. Room was very comfortable. Nice furnishings. Bathroom was beautifully decorated with good amenities. The only problem we encountered was incorrect information given by a staff member regarding the availabilty of cabs in the area, very high price for a hotel towncar ride and very poor walking directions that caused sore feet and exhaustion. The manager was very apologetic and offered free breakfast for our two days there. We would have preferred some compensatory transportation around town to make up for the sore feet.

<Content>Excellent location, great staff, good price I stayed at the Orchard for 6 nights by the end of Sept. The good experience begun when I booked the hotel and Jim was the kindest person, quickly answering to my e-mails. Thank you very much for arranging my stay, Jim!! My flight to San Fran was delayed, so I arrived at the hotel around 2 AM and people at front desk/doorman were really nice (I am sorry I do not remember your names, but thank you for the speedy check-in - I was reeeally tired). In addition to the great staff, Orchard has an excellent location, just a few steps from cable car stop (if you are not driving, I suggest you to buy the MUNI pass valid during your stay in San Fran) and 2 blocks from Union Square shops and Chinatown Gate. The room is perfectly clean and spacious, so is the bathroom. I totally recommend this hotel!! And, for the lady in the front desk who suggests wonderful restaurants, please include 鈥淗ouse of Nanking鈥?in your list (the place is not fancy, but the food is incredible 鈥?just ask the waiter to choose your food).

<Content>Double check your bill I was in town for a conference and stayed at the Orchard Hotel. I really enjoyed my stay until I later saw on my credit card statement that the hotel had overcharged my stay. I contacted the hotel immediately, and an Orchard hotel staff member indicated that I had a mini-bar charge, which was not true. The hotel staff member assured me that they will take care of it and refund the overcharge within 5 business days. As I found out a week and a half after the call, the hotel had not process my refund. I contacted the hotel a second time, and they informed me that nothing has been processed and they will take care of it. I asked the hotel to call me when they processed the refund. The Orchard staff promised that one of their finance members will call me within 48 hours. Surprise, surprise, the hotel did not call me back. However, I gave them a couple of days to see if perhaps they processed my refund but somehow forgot to return my call. Not only did the hotel not return my call, but they did not refund the overcharge. I contacted the hotel for the third time, and the lady told me that she could NOT help me because she was NOT the people that I spoke to earlier. I informed her that I had spoken to two different people and that both gave me the same spiel about 'how they will take care of it' but neither followed through. I told her that ''Why in the world would I want to talk to those individuals again when they couldn't follow through their promises to their customers? Hence, the reason that I want to talk to someone else.' She then told me that she 'will take care of it'. I informed her that I will keep calling the hotel until I get this resolved. Within an hour, the hotel called me back and told me the refund has been processed. Honestly, the Orchard hotel should not have taken nearly four weeks to process my refund. Furthermore, why did the hotel immediately processed my refund ONLY after I stated that I will keep calling the hotel until this situation gets resolved? All the positive things that I had planned to write on Tripadvisor.com about this hotel were trumped by the hotel staff members' lack of credibility and professionalism. So, double check your credit card statement with your hotel bill for discrepancies.

<Content>Orchard Hotel in fall I can thoroughly recommend the Orchard as an excellent base in San Francisco. It's in a great position - not too far from shops and theatres, but far enough to escape the noise of the downtown area. Very handy for the cable car stop too, and if you're tempted to take a Grayline tour, their shuttle bus will pick you up at the Orchard.The breakfast menu is the best I've experienced in the US and the service and cleanliness are second to none. Overall, the hotel has STYLE - go for it!!!VB from the UK

<Content>This hotel is fantastic! My wife and I stayed here for the final weekend of our honeymoon. The entire staff took excellent care of us. Upon arrival, the gentleman from the front desk brought our bags up to our room and then helped us to choose a place to eat. He made no less than 4 phone calls on our behalf to get us a reservation. We ended up at an amazing restaurant that night! I have nothing but good things to say about the quality, cleanliness, staff and location of The Orchard Hotel! We will undoubtedly stay there again on other trips to San Francisco.

<Content>Good value, good hotel We chose this hotel for its proximity to the Ritz-Carlton where I had a conference, and due to glowing reviews on TripAdvisor. The reviews were right!This hotel is well-located, close to Union Square shopping but on a quieter street part way up to Nob Hill. We didn't notice traffic noise at night. We had several requests -- early check-in, lower floor, facing the street instead of the alley, not close to elevator, and mattress pad. (a previous reveiwer wrote about hard mattresses but with the pad the bed was fine) They were all accommodated easily, and we were able to check in a couple of hours early. We were on the 2nd floor which is where the very little exercise room is but few people use it so it wasn't disturbing. The standard rooms are a generous size.The complimentary breakfast is good, with cut up fruit (including strawberries!) as well as the usual toast, croissants etc. Servers bring juice and coffee so we tipped $5/day. Tomato slices were a nice touch.High-speed internet access is free and they will provide a cable if you forget one. There is also a free DVD library with an excellent selection. Aveda toiletries were really nice.This is a newer hotel, all non-smoking which is great. It's not high-end or luxurious but perfectly adequate and very good value for money. We booked the AAA rate off the internet and seemed to get a decent rate, as we were there for Fleet Week and many hotels were full.Staff were all helpful and friendly, and the doorman even walked to the corner to get us a cab once. There's also a house car to take people to the airport, $45 flat rate plus tip which is a nice alternative to a regular cab.Because the windows don't open the air can be dry. This was partly negated by the fact that there was no extractor fan in the bathroom so it got a bit steamy after a shower. As the bathroom was quite large, it wasn't too much of a problem. A bit strange for a new hotel, though.Overall we were impressed and will stay here for any future trips to San Francisco.

<Content>Reviewers are right! We loved the Orchard. Staff were wonderful, room was large as was the bathroom. Very quiet and serene. The location, right off Union Square makes it easy to go almost anywhere in the City. The pizzeria cattycorner to the hotel (maybe it's called VItos?) has terrific pizza. You just can't go wrong at the Orchard.

<Content>The Orchard Hotel....Loved it...Great We recently visited San Francisco for a family wedding..many of the guests stayed at the Orchard Hotel. It was our first visit and it was absolutely wonderful !! The rooms were so tranquil, very quiet and spacious.The complementary breakfast was certainly appreciated and was very nice each morning. We had all ages in our group from under 2 yrs to some in their 80's. The staff was very accommodating and flexible dealing with all of our needs. Each day we needed transportation several times for as few as 2 to as many as 16 people and the staff at the Orchard effortlessly and willingly made all of our arrangements......they made it so easy for us! The Hotel and the rooms are very clean and decorated very nicely. The hotel is centrally located ..a short walk to Chinatown,Union Square,great restaurants,coffee shops,etc.and the cable car stops right outside the door...a real San Francisco experience. We plan to return soon, just for a little R  R this time and we will certainly stay at the Orchard.

<Content>Enjoyed the Orchard - nice change from the typical hotel Someone recommended The Orchard...and I took them up on trying to book a stay. As a federal employee I inquired about the per diem rate, and while it was lower than their internet rate they honored it. We typically stayed at Hyatt properties in San Fran...and I was nervous about the 'change.' The Orchard was a nice experience - the room was large and comfortable..and the breakfast was decent. The service and staff were very friendly and helpful. The location was excellent. I visit SF once a year on business - and I will likely stay here again.

<Content>Orchard Inn Great location -- was able to park the car and easily walk to restaurants and tourist areas (Wharf just 15 minute walk through China town). The Orchard Hotel was clean and nicely appointed. Doorman gave us excellent restaurant suggestions and driving directions. Should we find ourselves in San Francisco again, we鈥檇 stay at the Orchard Hotel

<Content>A GREAT Choice Our first visit to San Fran was a 3-night end of trip visit m(we had been in Hawaii). We were not disappointed with our choice of staying at The Orchard Hotel. The rooms were quite spacious and clean. The bed, linens and pillows were glorious! Everyone we met from the front desk staff to the concierge to the doorman were very willing to be as helpful as they could be. The continental breakfast was a plus and wasn't huge but certainly adequate with homemade croissants, sweet rolls, muffins, fruit, bagels, english muffins, hard boiled eggs, one variety of cheese and usually ham. It was a nice touch for the wait persons served your coffee and juice. The only thing bad I can even say about this hotel is it can be a little noisy (on the back side at least) from trash pickup during the night. I suspect that this is NOT relevant to this hotel only. If we go to San francisco again, we would not hesitate to stay at this hotel.

<Content>Excellent Stay in the Orchard Stayed in the Orchard for the final leg of our honeymoon and was very impressed with the hotel. Room was very nice and loved the complimentary breakfast. Hotel is just 4 blocks (all downhill) to Union Square and the Powell Hyde and Mason cable car stops at the corner of Bush and Powell, directly beside the hotel and so you have easy access to Fishermans Warf (however that place is just a little tacky for my liking). Overall very good hotel, pleasant staff, and great location.

<Content>Nice basic hotel For our first trip to California we consulted Trip Advisor and selected the Orchard based on the reviews. We were not disappointed as the hotel was pretty much what we expected. Centrally located and on the cable car route, it provided a nice clean place to stay and a good location base to see the city. The front desk was quite helpful in answering any questions and the housekeeping in the rooms was impeccable.Breakfast was ample and varied. Overall a good experience.

<Content>Great Hotel My Husband and I stayed at the Hotel for two nights and we were very impressed!!When we initially arrived at the hotel, I have to say, my heart sank. The hotel looked quite grubby from the outside and when we went into the lobby, I was slightly concerned at how small it was. I thought, small lobby...small rooms. How wrong I was.We were given room 304 and its one of the biggest rooms I've ever stayed in within a city! The room was spotless, the towels fluffy, and the water was warm. Even the bathroom was massive.Our room looked right out on to Bush Street, but noise was'nt a problem.My only gripe with the hotel, is that I had emailed the hotel before our holiday, and asked them to suggest a few restaurants for my husband and I to go to on our Anniversary. They didnt reply.I would highly recommend this hotel and wouldnt hesitate on staying there again.

<Content>An Oasis - loved it! We loved this hotel and will definitely make it our base in SF when we return. Based on other reviews I asked for a room on a higher floor and for a pillow top (I read that the matresses were quite hard). The hotel was very accommodating of our requests. We asked for a very early check in and this was no problem - our room was ready when we arrived from the airport. Our room was very spacious with a huge bathroom and everything very clean. With the pillow top the bed was really comfortable so if you like a softer bed ask them to put a pillow top on for you. It was very quiet in our room. Reception people, housekeeping and concierge were excellent. Breakfast was great. Lots of choice and very comfortable dining area. I highly recommend this hotel. It is very convenient for Union Square and Nob Hill.We really liked the free wireless and free DVD library.

<Content>Great location, decent place to stay, everything works, nice big bathroom. We spent two nights at the hotel with a baby over the weekend. Corner rooms have nice big bathrooms with large bath tubs, the hot water is hot, you can put your food in the minibar which is behind lock and key, and you can ask for extra pillows at no extra charge, the clothes iron is high up on a wall rack in the closet, all great if you have a baby or young kid. Efficient use of space in the common areas, so it doesn't strike you as grand-looking when you enter the hotel.Great location, great location, great location. Near Union Square, very convenient and accessible for shopping, several good restaurants within 5-15 minutes by foot (e.g. Masa's, Farallon, etc). Walgreens (pick up some diapers!) just one block South along Powell Street. There's a Powell St Cable Car stop just 20 paces from the hotel entrance, which could take you to Hyde or to Fisherman's Wharf depending on which Car you take. A cab to the Ferry Building at Embarcadero costs under $10.Friendly counter staff (e.g. Grace), knowledgeable and helpful concierge/valet/doormen (e.g. Cornell, Art). Buffet breakfast was a bit simple for $20, but adequate to get your day going with a full stomach - cereal, milk, croissants, muffins, bread, cheese, ham, juices, etc. Lots of fruit (watermelon, cantaloupe, pineapple, peaches or plums, etc), which can be useful if your baby is just starting on solid food.Complementary Internet access, with in-room RJ-45 in probably all rooms, and additionally Wi-Fi connectivity but up to level 2 only. It worked fine (they're using a Nomadix; remember to collect your password from the front desk when you check in). The connectivity is managed by WiFi Guys, who sport a toll-free customer support number, with no extra charge if you call it from your in-room phone.The valet parking service makes use of a multi-level garage along Bush Street across Powell Street from the hotel. I think it costs $30-50 per 24 hours through the valet service. But parking is both crazy and expensive in San Francisco anyway, so you're better off making use of this if you have both a baby and a car. Let them know 10-15 minutes before you need your car.We think it was good value overall, and would stay there if we plan to be near Union Square with a baby again.

<Content>Should not be rated the #2 hotel in San Francisco I decided to stay at The Orchard hotel because it is rated #2 on this website, and all the reviews are positive. I also found a great rate. To start with the postive the hotel room is a good size, clean, and has a comfortable feel. The negatives are the bed was very hard. That may be a positive to some, but a big negative in my case. The biggest downer was we only had cold water for our showers. We informed the hotel of this issue, but the next day again another cold shower. We took showers at different times too, at night, morning, late morning, so it isn't that they ran out of hot water. When we went to check out the staff member's comment was Why didn't you tell us earlier about the problem which was not the correct response. After taking cold showers for 3 days I want to hear I am very sorry or an explanation, because surely cold showers aren't the norm, right?Anyway, I have found this website extremely helpful in researching trips I have taken and I just wanted to give back!

<Content>Great hotel, great location - highly recommended What a great hotel in a fantastic location. The room we booked (one bedroom with separate living room) was excellent - clean, comfortable with some pleasurable extras (nice bathrobes, Aveda toiletries and free DVD rental). A Quiet room despite facing the street. Staff were really helpful (the valet went to the car for me to get a book I'd left and didn't charge me). Parking is pricey but not extortionate and return was prompt and efficient. Breakfast was very good - fresh fruit, pastries and muffins. One of the nicest hotels I've stayed in.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised!! My family and I stayed at The Orchard Hotel and loved it! I had never heard of it before, but after doing research on the web found it to be highly recommended. I can honestly say that we were surprised with most to all the hotel had to offer. First of all, It is a smaller hotel which was a great change to all the hustle and bustle of a large chain hotel that I would normally stay in. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The hotel is centrally located in the city-just up the hill from Union Square, but out of the way enough to get away from all the people. Our room was spacious with ample room for the three of us, clean, and offered Aveda products in the bathroom which my wife didn't mind. The hotel served a continental breakfast every morning with fresh fruit, juice, pastries, and cereal. Overall, I would recommend The Orchard for anyone from the business traveler to the family on a weekend getaway and we will definitely be back!

<Content>Very pleased with our Orchard Hotel experience August 29th, 2007 - My boyfriend and I just returned form our San Francisco vacation and were very pleased with our Orchard Hotel experience. All of our expectations were met and some were even exceeded. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was clean, quiet, and well-appointed. We like the small boutique hotel atmosphere and this one was just what we wanted. The location was great, just up the street from the Chinatown gate and very close to Union Square. As mentioned by many reviewers, the parking rate was high, but average for the city. We would definitely stay at The Orchard again.

<Content>First Pleasure Trip to SF Choosing a boutique hotel for your first pleasure trip to San Francisco was a little more adventurous than my wife and I ordinarily allow, but we took the advice of so many others on Trip Advisor and must say we were really pleased. The hotel is quiet, very convenient to the cable car lines (Powell, California and F Line), and the hotel staff from the desk, concierge and continental dining staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. The rooms are very comfortable and I thought the rates very, very good. I did not mind that the hotel did not have a full dining room as there are excellent restaurants nearby. In fact, I found the Roxanne, right next door, to be perfect for breakfast when I got tired of the continental fare, but the continental breakfast (free) at the hotel was really pretty nice. We are not frequent travelers, so we did not fully understand the hotel's refusal to allow us to take the continental back to the room, but it was not a big deal. If you have not been to SF before and you are going to be there for anything near three days, get the city pass that allows you to travel on the muni systems including the cable cars. The stop for the Powell lines is all of 50 paces from the hotel door and is a must for sane travel around SF. The Powell line can take you down to Market where you can get the F Line from Market and Stockton to do all of the Fisherman Wharf stops. From Fishermans Wharf you can get either the Powell Hyde or the Powell Mason cable car back to the intersection of Bush and Powell and see most of what you want to see in downtown SF by riding them that way. Ask for a map when you check in and the staff will explain it to you.

<Content>We will return to the Orchard Hotel We were greeted by pleasant and friendly staff even though our check-in was very late, indeed the staff were always courteus and helpful.The room was tastefully decorated, comfortable and clean. The location is great for exploring San Francisco (what a fantastic city), especialy as it is so close to the trolley cars..... it is worth getting a pass for the MUNI as its great value for the trolly cars, the trams and buses.I know we will visit San Francisco again, and we wil definately stay at the Orchard........... no problems recommeding this hotel to you.

<Content>Great Stay My husband and I stayed at the Orchard on the first leg of a two week journey through Northern and Southern California. It was a great hotel. Spotless and quiet. The breatkfast was great for a continental - lots of fresh fruit, meats, and pastries. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Good location and reasonable price too.

<Content>Nice quiet accommodations The Orchard Hotel is a nice hotel just a couple of blocks from Union Square. As I write this review (8/3/07) it is rated the #1 hotel in all of San Francisco. That's probably a bit too generous...its probably not the best this great city has to offer, but it is definitely good and worthy of your consideration. And a pretty good value. We paid less than $200 a night.This is a small, clean, comfortable, and most importantly, a quiet hotel. It is very clean, and they also offer free WiFi, which some others in the city charge for. There is also a laptop in the lobby you can use for checking email, flight status, etc.The bathroom was great - larger than average with an elegant appearance. The room was probably larger than most hotel rooms in San Francisco, but not large by any definition. But it was comfortable. Our room had a lousy view of an alley, but then again, we didn't choose this place for its view. Our room location may have been a factor in the quietness.Also, the hotel is just steps from a Hyde St cable car stop, so you can get quickly to and from Fisherman's Wharf. Chinatown is 2 blocks down Bush St, Union Square is 2 blocks down Powell. Extremely convenient location.The staff was friendly and helpful, especially the doorman. We've stayed in 4 different hotels in San Fran, and The Orchard is the best we experienced.

<Content>Can't wait to go back!!! The Orchard Hotel was wonderful from the moment we got there at 3:00 AM. It was late (early) and we were still met by two smiling faces. The rest of of our three day stay was just as good. Everyone was helpful, friendly and inviting. The location was great! The cable car stopped right at the top of the street. Ask about the ally full of places to eat. Can't wait to go back!!!

<Content>Excellent Stayed recently for 3 nights and was impressed with the Orchard, especially at the price!Making the reservation by phone was easy too.We had 2 rooms, a king  2 queen bed, overlooking the street. The rooms were light, airy  sizeable with good furnishings, good amenities and very well decorated. Big bathrooms too. However, I'm glad that our rooms weren't on the back of the propoerty overlooking the alley.Location is superb, only 2 blocks from Union Square  20 yards from the Powell St cable car (although this was nearly always full whilst we were there). Noise for us wasn't an issue at all.Buffet breakfast was included and sufficient, and it was good to eat before heading off for the day. The restaurant  bar weren't open for dinner whilst we were there which was a pity, as it would have been nice to return for a drink after dinner.DVD loan facility was a nice touch; our teenagers enjoyed a couple of hours watching movies.Cornell the concierge was very helpful with directions, restaurant reservations etc.All in all, the Orchard deserves to be #1 in San Fran!

<Content>we were not disappointed We stayed at the Orchard for five nights, July 13th to the 18th. We chose the hotel based on the positive reviews and lack of negative reviews on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed. It was everything everyone said it was. Our room was spacious and well appointed with tasteful furnishings. We made good use of the in room internet and safe. The king bed was extremely comfortable.The breakfast had everything we wanted; lots of fresh fruit, cereal, variety of breads, sweat breads and croissants, many juices, good coffee. It was not the same every day and did vary to some degree. The location is excellent, just a short walk to many popular San Fran sights.The staff was helpful  courteous, and always maintained their professionalism.When we return we wil stay here!

<Content>Good location, good quality, but noise issues I stayed at the Orchard in May. Overall, I think it's a good value for the area. The location is really superb and the transportation options nearby are excellent! You don't need a car at all if you are staying within SF. There's a BART/Muni station just five blocks southand a cable car stop out in front. I had no problems taking BART fromSFO. The only difficulty there was schlepping my luggage up the hill. The hotel is smack dab between the Union Square and Nob Hill areas, so there are a bewildering number of restaurants to choose from. There's no need for any of that in the morning as the complimentary breakfast is excellent, with ample choices. My only complaint there is that you don't have the option of bringing your breakfast back to the room.My room was fine. No view, but clean! This is one of the cleanest and best stocked hotel rooms I've ever been in. Now let's talk about the noise. I think one or two reviews have mentioned the garbage trucks. One came in the middle of the night during my stay and was incredibly audible! Also, I was able to hear my neighbors a bit, eventhough they were only talking and not being very noisy. So, just a few things to keep in mind if you're a light sleeper or sensitive to noise.

<Content>Great stay at the Orchard Hotel My partner and I took advantage of the 'stay for 3 nights, pay for 2 nights' deal, and had a great stay at the Orchard Hotel in late June/early July. We arrived early after a 12 hour flight from New Zealand, and were grateful that our room was available immediately. Our king room was clean and spacious. The bed was very comfortable, the shower good pressure, and the amenities good. The hotel has an excellent location - only a couple of blocks uphill from Union Square, and close to Nob Hill and the likes of the Mark Hopkins Hotel (where you can have an early evening cocktail or beer and have a marvellous view over an Francisco).We had a nice filling complimentary breakfast (cereal, toast, fresh fruit, coffee) every day in the hotel restaurant.The hotel staff were attentive and friendly.All in all - an excellent bargain, and we will be happy to stay there again.

<Content>Mixed Reviews I had read a lot of reviews before selecting the Orchard, and did so because of many positive reviews on this website. I've had good luck in the past using Trip Advisors' reviews, but found the results mixed this time. The high points: the Orchard is in a great location, between Union Square and the top of Nob Hill. This is a good place to be, in my opinion; not as costly as the name places on the top of Nob Hill, and not as noisy as those hotels right on Union Square. Front desk service was friendly and capable, though when we arrived around 7 p.m. on a weeknight, there was only one person behind the front desk, and no bellman apparent. But the reception was still courteous and quick, since things were not very busy. The room itself was a nice size, clean, and well furnished with one major exception: the bed was very hard, and not what one would expect in a superior hotel (no box spring: just a mattress on a the wooden bed base). This may sound like a small point, but after four nights, we were very ready to not sleep here any longer. It just was not a good bed. The hotel offered a turn-down service, but we found the knock on our door at 6:30 p.m. to make the offer too early, and intrusive (as we were getting ready to go out for the evening). Can't this thing just happen while one is out to dinner, as it does in so many other hotels? All in all, this is a fine hotel, and for the price, a good deal for the area it is in. It is not, though, a 4 star experience, and for those spending more than a night, I would probably recommend spending a bit more, and staying on Nob Hill, or at one of the better Starwood properties in town instead. But if you're in town for ony a night or two, don't mind the harder bedding, and want good value for the location, this is undeniably a fine place to stay.

<Content>Nice place, good location, very clean and updated rooms We only stayed at the Orchard Hotel for one night, but it was a very nice experience. The room was really very nice and spacious, especially for the price. It appears that they must have recently done a renovation as the room appeared to have barely been used which was wonderful. The next time we are in San Francisco, we will likely stay here again. We typically stay at higher end hotels and resorts (e.g. Four Seasons, Ritz, JW Marriotts, etc.). We chose this hotel based upon reviews and we were very pleased. The staff was friendly and helpful. We did not use the fitness facility and only ate breakfast in the restaurant - they told us that it is in the process of changing over to another operator or concept or something like that so they were not serving dinner.Overall, very nice place to stay while in San Francisco.

<Content>Great Hotel and Great Location!!!! I booked our stay at The Orchard Hotel based on the reviews on tripadvisor and am glad I did. The location is centrally located and there is a cable car stop at the end of the block. Not to mention, Chinatown is just a couple blocks away and Union Square is also a short walk away. In addition, the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. They immediately greeted us and even tried to give us a room with a view (try to request this when you book the room). The breakfast was also very good. Coffee, orange juice, water and milk were provided as beverages. Fresh canteloupe, honeydew, yogurt, packaged oatmeal, bagles, cream cheese, hard boiled eggs, sliced deli meat and toast were also available. Breakfast was served buffet style and began at 8:30 a.m. It was nothing over the top, but it was free and fresh and very good! The rooms were decorated nicely, the bedding and furniture were pretty, and the bathrooms were also nice. Basically, the room was up-to-date as far as style and furniture/appliances. Appearances really come into consideration for me when choosing a hotel and this one met the bill. Not to mention, the price was affordable and the location was a bonus. I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning trip to San Francisco!

<Content>Great SF hotel We had such trouble picking just the right SF hotel and decided to go with the Orchard b/c it seemed to have the most consistently positive reviews. I am so glad we did! Everything was terrific - from the woman at the front desk who could not have been nicer to the comfy bed to the perfect SF location. We were excited for our trip and were willing to pay a reasonable price for a great hotel. We just didn't want to spend a fortune on something that turned out to be mediocre. The Orchard was the right choice. No question.

<Content>Good Hotel, hotel staff were disappointing This Hotel was very nice at check in the staff was helpful and courteous. The room was very nice. The bed was soft and the room was clean. I have a complaint/ warning about the parking. We chose to park our rental car overnight on our first night there at $35 per night. Then we returned the rental car to the rental company and relied on public transportation the rest of our trip. (On a side note give yourself extra time to get around on the streetcar and and the F trolley- very crowded). Upon checkout I noticed charges for multiple days of parking. I mentioned to the desk clerk that we only stayed one night. She rolled her eyes and said Let me see and called over the Doorman. He stated he would have to call the garage. The Desk clerk then said very cocky Did you TELL anyone that you weren't brining the car back I said I wasn't aware I had to, she then rolled her eyes again laughed at me and said well how are we supposed to know you aren't bringing the car back unless you tell the front desk. I assumed they checked cars in and out as they are brought in and out. The doorman said it was probably a mistake because it showed our car as currently checked in and it wasn't there. The desk clerk begrudgingly reversed the charge and told me next time to tell the correct people about the car. She said it was not the doormans job to charge us it was the front desk. It was sad to end a nice stay this way. Also, I was never told of any breakfast option that was offered, upon reading other reviews I noticed people mentioning it, so you may have to ask. The hotel restaurant was closed for renovation during our stay so I assumed breakfast was off.All and all a nice stay but staff had mixed attitudes.

<Content>Skeptic who loved this hotel OK, like many of you reading all the reviews, I was very skeptical of this hotel. How could it get so many great reviews, yet still be so cheap? Well, my husband and I loved it. No, it's not the Four Seasons, but it is a very clean, large room with a comfy bed, and a nice sized bathroom with Aveda products. And it's close to everything. And even though I wasn't expecting the service to be great because of the price, I was wrong. The staff was very helpful with every question we had. The only disappointment was the breakfast, but at these prices, who cares? We will definitely be back.

<Content>Highly recommended. Very convenient position for trolleys and Union Square.Quiet, well-appointed with very helpful staff. The continental breakfast was good, although quality of coffee was disappointing for a hotel of this quality (we had a similar experience with the coffee machine in the room). However, we would strongly recommend this hotel and will return.

<Content>Very nice hotel Our family of 6 (including 2 small children) stayed here July 3 - July 5, as part of our west coast vacation. We loved this hotel. It is new, very clean and pleasant. We liked the small lobby, breakfast area, and the rooms. We had one regular room with a kind bed, and a suite which had a king bed in the bedroom and a queen sofa bed in the living room for our children.The location is excellent for tourists in San Francisco. We went to see Golden Gate Bridge and Muir Woods before checking into the hotel so we could drive there. The hotel has valet parking as the only real option ($ 34 per day). Parking is very difficult in San Francisco, so valet is reasonable here. After leaving the car with the valet, we did the rest of the sites by walking or taking the cable cars. This hotel is located very close to Union Square (lots of shopping and restaurants), Westfield Centre (very large high end mall), and China town. These were easy to walk to. There are some hills, but that is part of what you expect to see in San Francisco as a tourist. The cable car stop is at the intersection of Bush and Powell, within a few yards of the hotel, where 2 cable car lines stop. You can get an all day pass for the cable cars (and buses) for $11 per day at Walgreens (located one block from hotel). I recommend this option because otherwise it is $5 per ride. You can take the Mason-Powell cable car north to the end of the line, and then walk a few blocks to pier 33 for Alcatraz tours. You can take the Hyde-Powell cable car north to see the crooked part of Lombard St. It is a lot more fun to take cable cars rather than cabs. We like the Union Square area much better for our hotel instead of Fisherman's wharf area (were we stayed in the past).The hotel gives out a great map of San Francisco (including the transit system) and a San Francisco Visitors Guide, which has great maps of the Downtown/Union Square area (including names and locations of stores and restaurants).Overall we loved this hotel and the location. Enjoy your trip.

<Content>We will be Back My wife and i recently stayed at The Orchard and we were very pleased with our decision.This Boutique style Hotel is a gem.We were staying on the 6th floor overlooking Bush St and had a good veiw of the surrounding area.It was very quiet at night and had no problems sleeping since they have the most resplendent mattress's to sleep on!As a matter of fact we missed the free breakfast one morning because of sleeping in!!The Cable Car Stop is right out the front door on Powell and Union Square with all the great shopping and Restaurants is just a few blocks over.We choose to take a ferry to Sausilito one day and walk across the Golden Gate Bridge back to Fishermans Wharf.It took about 6 hrs and the way is over mostly designated walkways and paths etc ..Well after a long day of sightseeing these 2 very tired Canucks couldn't have been more pleased to come back to The Orchard.

<Content>Great experience The Orchard Hotel is perfect if you are looking for a great value, very nice accomodations and a fantastic location without the crowds, hassles and prices of a large chain hotel. The best thing about The Orchard is it's location. It basically sits in the Nob Hill/Union Square area on the corner of Powell and Bush Streets which is 3-4 blocks from Union Square and 2-3 blocks from the main gate to China Town. The Powell-Mason and Powell-Hyde cable cars lines are literally 20 steps from the hotel front door. Both will take you to Union Square and the Powell Street BART station and either to Fishermans Wharf or North Beach depending on which cable car you hop on. But if you aren't into the cable cars or feel like getting some exercise then Union Square is a quick 5 minute walk straight down Powell Street and China Town is also a 5 minute walk straight down Bush Street. If you are renting a car the closest and best place is on O'Farrell Street in the heart of Union Square about 4 blocks from the hotel. There are 4-5 major rental car companies and the mid week rates are relatively cheap. We rented a four door Economy for $28 per day. And here's a little secret........if you have to keep your car overnight but don't want to pay the $30+ for overnight parking at the hotel then you can park for $15 (late night special) in the same garage as where you first picked it up for as long as you arrive after 7pm and leave the garage before 9am. The Orchard is a great value because your room rate includes free continental breakfast every morning, free internet and a free shuttle to the financial district. We stayed there a few weeks ago and averaged approximately $175 per night. Other larger chain hotels in the immediate area were $250+ per night and didn't include breakfast or internet access. The rooms are very nice and in great condition with updated features including comfortable beds, nice furniture and a stocked honor bar including cold drinks, snacks etc. Our bathroom was larger than average and very nice with a marble floor, high quality toiletries and a very nice sink / vanity.Overall a fantastic hotel that I would highly recommend.

<Content>Great Honeymoon My wife and I were in San Francisco for our honeymoon and selected The Orchard based on comments from this website. We were both amazed at the personal service from the minute we arrived! The hotel staff was great...when we arrived with no idea where to have dinner, they immediately asked us what we were in the mood for and booked us a table on the spot. For the price, location, size of the rooms and great customer service - this is an unbeatable value in SF.

<Content>What's Not To Like? We just left San Francisco and checked out of the Orchard Hotel. It鈥檚 hard to think of how the experience could have been better in a boutique hotel that鈥檚 not working at being 鈥渋n your face鈥? but offers service, attention, and some details not found in a large scale convention hotel. If you can get in, stay there. My thoughts follow:Room:We were traveling with our daughter, so we opted for a suite. It was lovely. D茅cor, furniture and detailing were wonderful and the rooms were very spacious. Like the rest of the hotel, everything was in an Oriental theme. The bathroom was gigantic. The remodeling features granite sinks and window sills through the hotel, and we loved it. Rating 10.Location:The location at Bush and Powell was excellent. If you鈥檙e a walker, you can walk to Chinatown, North Beach, Union Square, and many other locations. If not, take cabs or the cable car. Everything you need is within a short distance. Rating 10.Staff and Service:Super. Extremely helpful, without any attitude of artificial cool factor. Everything worked out perfectly. Rating 10BreakfastOffered continental breakfast every morning at the restaurant/bar in the hotel. Don鈥檛 recall the name. Extremely spacious with plenty of room to eat and spread out without being in other guests faces. Food was good, not great. Rating 7.5Summary:If you are looking for a terrific place, totally up to date with many features and amenities in a boutique hotel Orchard Hotel is for you. Overall Rating 9.25

<Content>Excellent location; a few quibbles Travelling with a teenage daughter taking college tours, this was our splurge hotel. She had never been to SF and I was returning after 20 years. The location is absolutely the best and must be figured in with every other deciding factor. We had a wonderful time, easily walking from the hotel through Chinatown, North End (Italian) and then finishing up at and immediately turning back from the touristy Wharf. It was interesting, almost disheartening, for her to see that there are repeat performances at all tourists areas throughout the world (d.j.s, fast painting, same restauraunt chains, same hustle) and that it is important to find the unique aspects (sourdough bread) in each city. SO, back to the hotel. We arrived with a rental car which we eventually returned early . Parking was a total drag. The hotel admonished us to watch out for towing, asking us to remember to fill the meters up until after ticket time, etc. and always segued by encouraging us to use their extremeley expensive valet service. Well, this can be taken both ways I expect and they were just trying to (in my most optimistic mood) keep us from getting towed, but I do live in a major city, know how to read meters and so on. Bottom line is a happy one: you don't really need a car if you are staying in SF! We actually drove to and from Santa Clara, returned the car to the airport, took the BART train back in to town and used BART again to get back to the airport. Further to the hotel, as promised..The bed was remarkably comfortable. We had no view but it did not matter. Daughter liked the Aveda products. Our tub did not drain well (7th floor) and water was nigh calf high after the two of us took back to back and not excessively long showers. Admittedly, I neglected to mention this until our last day, however this issue is rarely encountered at even the most budget oriented hotels. I was not able get online (directed to an 800 number for which I had not the energy to deal) so instead used the very accessibly computer right at the reception desk. Was able to print out boarding passes, quickly check email, etc. We were too tired to use the movies, but it was a nice idea.As to breakfast, and having read the earlier reviews, I really cannot imagine what else on earth one could want unless it is total table service with warm food being served by request. No, there is no Devonshire cream, made to order pancakes, soft boiled eggs on toast crusts. Isn't that the not included breakfast concept where we get to order a specific breakfast? We were thrilled with the choices: fresh (not sugared!) yogurt, fresh fruit (lots of it ) toast, and so on. There were numerous choices, in our opinion. We even took some bananas and apples for the road when on our way back. I am not a business traveller for this review, however, if the getting online in room problem could be fixed, I would highly recommend this hotel for that purpose.

<Content>excellent spent 7 nights with 2 rooms for our family of 4 including a 16 and 19 year old.Complimentary breakfast was convienent although same spread every morning ( breads, coffee cake, bananas, hard boiled eggs, ham, cheese, cereals) but filled us up each morning.Rooms were nice- I asked for the Bush street side based on other reviews- and the nights were quiet.Complimentary DVD rentals with a large list was a nice perk.Very friendly staff

<Content>Good stay at the Orchard We stayed for 4 nights at this hotel early June. Excellent location, easy access to shops, restaurants and cable cars.The room was a good size and was quite cozy. The breakfast wasn't brilliant (limited selection of cereal/fruit/toast) but fine just to pick up something before hitting the shops, sights etc.No complaints about the service, although we tend not to rely on the hotel staff to inform about where to go and what to do. The major positive for this hotel is location - central enough to be in easy reach of all the amenities and sights but peaceful enough to grab some rest.

<Content>Great Place to Stay Just finished a five day at the Orchard in SF. Great location just two blocks up the hill from Union Square. I stayed at the Hotel because the location where my conference(SoMa) was at was booked. I walked daily to the conference and it was just fine. The spouse was with me and toured while I worked. So much to do and see in a wonderful city. We were told by other guests that the companion restaurant down the street (the name escapes me) was wonderful. As to the hotel the front desk and concierge; they were on their game every minute. Any requests we had were responed to immediately and always with a smile. Front doors were opened. Room was immaculate with turndown (bed linen) service if you wanted it. Someone complained here about the beds being hard-I would have described them as firm but I slept like a baby and I am a light sleeper. This place is really a hidden gem-if you want a mattress that you can sink into find another place-its that simple in this town. Everything here was to our liking and we would go back in an instant.

<Content>Excellent experience My wife and I stayed here in September for a Fall weekend getaway, first time away without the kids in years.. Excellent service; clean, comfortable room; nice location for walking around S.F; decent breakfast buffet (nothing spectacular). No disappointments. Hired a limo for a day in Napa, took the ferry to Sausalito and Muir Woods another day. This is an excellent hotel for a couple on a leisure trip.

<Content>Wonderful Stay at the Orchard! Super hotel! We had a wonderful stay at the Orchard! The room was very clean and the staff was extremely helpful. We loved watching the free movies from the CD selection at the front desk. The breakfast was delicious every morning ( many food items to choose from). Many people had issues with the bed (earlier trip advisor posts) but on being a comfortable bed- it was! The down comforter and down pillows made us a little stuffy in the mornings so we switched to foam pillows. The staff was so friendly and helpful in this matter. Overall, we had a great time and wish to return one day.

<Content>Great Stay After a lot of consideration and research on TripAdvisor we decided on the Orchard Hotel. We decided to just book through the hotel. They had a Only In San Francisco package that was for 4 nights and included 2 City Passes for SF. The hotel was very nice. The rooms were spacious and clean. The bathroom was probably the biggest one I have ever seen in a hotel. The city newspaper was left at our door every morning. The hotel staff was always smiling and helpful with any questions. My wife and i spend long days walking around the city sight seeing so the complimentary DVD library came in very handy one night when we were not out on the town. The only somewhat negative thing to say about the hotel is that the European continental breakfast is not anything to speak of. It was fine for my wife and I because we eat much in the morning the but options are limited. Someone who needs a full breakfast in the morning to get going might not be satisfied. But my wife and I were more than happy with this quaint and nicely positioned hotel. The cable car stop was just at the corner and with the City pass that accompanied our hotel fee, it was a free ride to the wharf. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would not even bother looking for some place else to stay in the city when I visit again.

<Content>Orchard the Best! I booked my reservation at the Orchard based mainly on the reviews from TripAdvisor - and I wasn't disappointed! I like the fact that the hotel is small. It was cozy feeling, but definitely upscale. The room we stayed in advertised 2 European twin beds, but they were almost the size of doubles. The rooms were spacious enough for 2 adults and 4 large pieces of luggage. The bathroom was gorgeous and everything was clean. The concierge/doormen (no matter which ones were on duty), were especially helpful. When our tour bus didn't pick us up at the hotel at the scheduled time, our doorman called the sightseeing company to make sure they hadn't forgotten us.We booked 2 nights and got the third at 50% off. I thought the price without the discount was reasonable for a new hotel in the Union Square area, but with the discount we ended up paying $165 a night. Definitely a bargain.

<Content>A wonderful experience We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in early May, for a weekend break between business trips.The experience from start to finish was excellent. While being priced similarly to other boutique hotels, the Orchard featured so many little touches that just made your stay so much more pleasant. For example:- Large room, with king-size bed, and more pillows than anyone could ever use- Free (wired) internet access (wireless only on first 2 floors, due to range of the signal)- Large TV, with combined DVD/CD/Surround-sound system - with even (surprisingly) a bass speaker, that made watching any of the extensive range of complementary, up-to-date DVDs from the hotel reception a real cinematic experience- A 'calm' book and music CD on the table for those who have trouble sleeping- Amazing 'natural flow' taps in the bathroom, that, cheesy as it may sound, reminded me of a mountain stream!- Walk-in shower- A (quite stylish) laptop for guest use just by reception, with printer, on which I printed my Alcatraz tour tickets, and boarding passes for my onward flightThe staff were also very well turned out, professional, and always friendly. The overall experience was such as to make it impossible to leave the hotel feeling anything but positive.The location is also great - two blocks uphill from Union Square, and 20 paces from a Cable Car stop, which goes to Market Street in one direction (major 'real' shopping street / thoroughfare), and Fisherman's Wharf in the other (extremely touristy area).The only two hiccups: the breakfast in the downstairs restaurant, while complementary, is pretty limited in size, range and quality; I'd simply ignore it unless you really don't want to go out.The other was the Valet parking charges; the rate was advertised at $34 per 24hrs, which seemed just about reasonable - however, the valet's services are added on-top, as is tax - leading to just under $100 for two nights' parking, and taking the car out once in-between! This was as much as a week's car rental - and there is no other option. Parking in SF *is* expensive, but the price is $10 higher than at the local car parks, so the additional valet charges (I tipped as well) were unexpected.Overall, however, it's a wonderful hotel. Stay there.

<Content>Fantastic Value This hotel is a wee gem. We stayed there for 4 nights in mid April, and found staff and room very pleasant. Indeed, the bathrooms are as big as some hotel bedrooms! Lovely firm bed, great location, definately non-smoking (and smells it), nice breakfast included. We booked through the hotel website and got a good deal.

<Content>Really Nice and Great Value I was really pleased with this hotel after my husband found it on Trip Advisor. The hotel was in a really central location and we spent our mornings walking to the wharf (a long, hilly, but really great walk) which is definately something that can be done (I was pregnant). We would take a cable car or street car back to Union Square later and do some late afternoon shopping. Very nice staff, very clean rooms and bathrooms. The hotel is a block away from Chinatown and a few blocks from a great little street (Belden) with some fantastic restaurants.

<Content>3 Night Stay I also booked this hotel based on the reviews here. Originally had a place booked on the Wharf, but after further reviews, decided to stay here and glad I did. Spent a lot of time reviewing all options and decided this was the place. Stayed 4/14 to 4/17. Fishermans Wharf is fun to visit, but it was nice to get away from all the activity. Booked via The Orchards website, AAA rates. Junior suite (#501) with view of Bush St. was roomy and, although right next to the elevator, was very quiet. Bathroom, big and spotless. King bed and ,surprisingly, pull-out queen sleeper were comfortable. Room was clean and modern. (I like new and big vs. old and small). Front staff couldn't have been better. Shout out to Brent-doorman (saved me a parking ticket), Art- doormen (knowledgable), Beth and the birthday girl (front staff) and the rest of the staff. Check in and check out were uneventful which is good. Continental breakfast was perfect for our needs as we're not big breakfast eaters, but did have breakfast one morning at Sears Restaurant, a couple blocks down. Don't miss it! Get the 3 or 7 day transportation pass for unlimited use of cable cars and buses (got ours at Walgreens, which is close). Arrived Sat., found a parking place on the street and found the meter is 25 cents for 5 minutes of parking. But after 6 pm, is free until Mon. am. Monday we parked a couple of blocks down Bush at the Sutter/Stockton garage. All in all, an excellent stay except for a minor hassle. Sun. a.m. went to the front desk for additional coffee packets for in room coffee maker and the person at front desk indicated ther was also coffe in the restaurant (run by another entity and not by the hotel). Went in, got two small cups to go, no charge (or I could pay $1.00 each for a large cup). Came back down and had continental breakfast. Mon. again went to the restaurant for coffee (half asleep) and was told by Jose that if I take coffee to go, this will be considered my continental breakfast or I can pay $1.50 per cup if I wanted coffee to go. Explained to him about Sun. He would not budge. Talked to Beth at front desk about this. We went back to talk to Jose and I could see Beth was surprised at his response and she asked when this change took place. He gave some lame excuse and refused her plea . She promptly took care of the problem, but all this over a couple of cups of coffee. As you know, it's never about the money. Other than that, a fantastic stay and I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Good value conveniently located with luxurious beds Having searched through lots of hotels on the web and tripadvisor reviews we were pleased we chose the Orchard. It had everything we needed without being a large noisy convention hotel. The beds and bedding were wonderful. At first I thought it was just my jet lag that made me sleep well but we were there a few days and slept soundly. Breakfast is adequate in a nice dining room. We had dinner there the first night as we were very tired and it was excellent. There is a small bar area which looks nice but we didn't use as we were out most of the time. It is a very short walk to Union square and we found San Francisco an easy city to walk around just take a jacket and sweater it can be very cold one day and sunny the next. The city attracts a lot of cloud.We went to Alcatraz and when we had tried to book on the web or by phone they said the boat was full for the whole of our stay but on contacting one of the tour companies we managed to go the very next day, they collected us from our hotel and took us to their central office (near Fishermans Wharf) and then we were taken to the boat and we then did a bus tour of the outer areas of San Francisco.If you are hiring a car after your trip to San Francisco as we did there is a Hertz office in short walking distance of the Orchard.

<Content>Excellent small hotel in a great city This was an absolute gem of a hotel. From walking through the door we were treated like friends and staff were exceptionally helpful and informative. The bar was ideal for pre and post dinner drinks and the breakfast was ideal.The rooms are a good size, so is the bathroom and all the comforts of a big hotel are there. The location is fantastic - it was 100 yards from the car hire company and about 10 minutes walk to downtown. We walked from here to the Golden Gate bridge - the best way to see a fabulous city. Can't wait to go back and stay at the Orchard.

<Content>Great hotel  Great hotel  great location!I booked this hotel following all the Tripadvisor praise and the hotel deserves the great reviews. It is fantastically well situated at the bottom on Nob Hill 1 block from the cable cars, 3 blocks from Union Market, and all the buses, subways you need to get anywhere. The room and bathroom was large, comfortable and clean. The hotel was quiet and the staff were extremely polite. I also have to say that the bed was unbelievably comfortable. Great value!My only criticism is the breakfast bar selection. Although I appreciated that is was available by day 3 it felt like very slim pickings but it did the job. (i.e toast, juice, ham/cheese plate, hard boiled egg, wholebran or kellogs cereal with milk or yoghourt. For fruit your option is an apple or a banana)Otherwise it was great!

<Content>Great Stay Stayed 3 nights in mid April for 1st Anniversary. Great location, short walk to Union Square and China Town. We also walked to Fisherman's Wharf, which isn't far, but is up and down some steep hills. Room was a good size, breakfast was adequate, was on a safe street, bellman and front desk were very friendly and helpful. Internet cable included for our laptop and in-room movies provided free.In sum, great value for great location and I will be staying here again when we return.

<Content>Nice, cozy, great hotel in Union Sq. San Francisco I've been to San Francisco several times, but this hotel definitely made our trip wonderful. The location was great, easy to walk everywhere, take a cable car right there! Room was comfortably specious, hotel staffs were really friendly. (Especially, the door man, Cornell! thank you for helping us a lot!) I used the AAA price. They gave us a good deal. This hotel will be our San Francisco Hotel.

<Content>Lovely stay at boutique spot. I recently spent three nights at this boutique hotel and found it extremely comfortable, warmly and well-serviced, and a very good deal for the price.The location is great 鈥?a few blocks from Chinatown, and a quick downhill walk to Market Street, and right next to the Powell-Mason cable car line. However, you are far enough away from the Union area crowds and traffic to feel as if you have some breathing room.The room was extremely comfortable with a great firm bed, very nice linens and pillows, and a surprisingly large space for a San Francisco hotel. Likewise, the bathroom was large, robes and slippers comfy, and Aveda products a nice touch. A minor complaint: although the shower water pressure was strong, I could not get the water temperature hot enough (even though the sink water could scorch you). The complimentary continental breakfast is served in a sunny and quiet area with most guests reading the hotel-provided newspapers. The food variety was decent (two cold cereal choices, instant oatmeal packets, breads, cheeses, fresh fruit, coffee and tea, etc.) but no options for hot food. We found the caf茅 around the corner (Caf茅 Roxanne) very very good. Didn鈥檛 try the caf茅 recommended by the front desk, which was the other block.The front desk staff was friendly but seemed to be a bit young and green; however, they were helpful despite their inexperience which worked out fine. They didn鈥檛 provide great suggestions or restaurants or other concierge-worthy advice.The mini-bar, DVD player and free movies sat untouched in my room but were nice amenities.Some warnings: like all San Francisco hotels, parking is EXPENSIVE ($34 + tip). Also, rooms facing the alley are subject to frequent and VERY LOUD garbage pick-ups in the middle of the morning! If you鈥檙e a light sleeper, you may prefer a room facing Bush Street.All in all, I would stay at this hotel again and recommend it to anyone looking for somewhat luxurious accommodations without the pampering service.

<Content>Agree with the praise We just returned from a weekend getaway in San Francisco, having stayed at the Orchard Hotel based solely on its high ranking on TripAdvisor. We weren't disappointed. Like others I found the bed a little firm but yet slept very well on it. The people working at the hotel seemed genuinely happy to be working there and I have nothing but praise for whoever runs this place. The breakfasts worked out perfectly for us (fresh fruit, plain yogurt, hard-bioled eggs, ham, cheese, cold cereal, coffee cake, breads, bagels with cream cheese, juices, and coffee).This place is a great example of a hotel that works and that includes a rate that works. How many times have you stayed at a $300+/night hotel and had a miserable stay? Too many for me to count. If more places provided the value that this place does the world would be a better place for the traveler.

<Content>Peaceful, European-like hotel Booked this hotel after reading TripAdvisor reviews and checking out the hotel site (liked the photo of a typical room), and then later realized that a friend had also recommended this hotel. AAA room rate I got through hotel website was slightly better than what was available from other popular hotel booking websites (hotels.com, orbitz). What a lovely, quiet place to stay. Room was as advertised, bathroom was spacious, all was very clean. Robes and slippers await guests. Enjoyed the Aveda bath products. Had dinner at the moderate-high priced restaurant downstairs, Vignette, which was surprisingly good (not crowded at all for a Saturday night, wonder how they survive). Because we were only staying for a one weekend (3/17/07) night, we lucked out and found street parking - left our car there and walked, taxied or took the BART to wherever we needed to go. Am told that the nearby Stockton/Sutter street parking structure was the best place for paid parking. Only complaint was the intermittent tapping noise we heard at night and in morning directly overhead in the bathroom (pipes?) We were in room 506, not sure if that was a problem anywhere else. Still, I'd stay there again (only in a different room) or try the nearby, newer, green Ochard Garden Hotel down the street.

<Content>Thankyou Tripadvisor This was our first visit to San Francisco, to the USA in fact and there was such a bewildering array of accommodation choices that I turned to Tripadvisor. I wholly endorse all the good comments about the Orchard Hotel, indeed it was on the strength of those that I chose to book.The Orchard has the efficiency of a large hotel but with the friendliness of a much smaller one. I believe they have the balance just right.Our room was spacious (very welome as we had large suitcases) and although facing onto Bush Street it was very quiet.All the staff were very helpful, with advice, directions, must sees and booking our city bus tour. We would certainly stay at the Orchard again or maybe try the Orchard Garden. We will also strongly recommend it to our friends

<Content>What a gem! We were very happy with our stay at the Orchard. Based on tripadvisorreviews, we booked a 6-night stay at the Orchard at the end of March.We got a very reasonable rate ($135/night) from the hotel website using our good old-fashioned AAA discount. We could not have been more pleased with the hotel. The location is fantastic. It's set a couple of blocks north of Union Square, giving you easy and quick access to Union Square, the Financial District, Chinatown, and the Embarcadero. Even though the hotel is in the middle of everything, it's located on a relatively calm, quiet street. It definitely feels like going home to walk up the short hill away from Union Square to the hotel. There's also a small grocery store on the same block where you can pick up snacks and anything you forgot from home.Inside, the hotel is very nicely appointed. Check-in at the marble-tiled lobby was smooth and quick. The rooms are clean, bright, and fresh. The beds are very big and comfortable, with soft white sheetsand fluffy comforters. The bathroom in our room was bright with clean, white tiles, and lots of Aveda bath products. High speed Internet is included, but unfortunately our room (on the 7th floor) did not have wireless. The complimentary breakfast buffet was a fantastic way to start the day. We took the newspaper that was delivered to our door down to the restaurant and enjoyed their freshly brewed coffee, toast, jams, cereal, fresh fruit, bagels, and juices every morning. The Orchard caters to a range of different groups of people. It is a great option for couples looking for a romantic weekend, business people wanting close access to downtown, and families with older children wanting a nice place to stay on vacation. We will definitelystay at The Orchard again next time we are in San Francisco!

<Content>Orchard is Fantastic My wife and I heard about the hotel from friends and booked our stay with our two children. We had a wonderful time. The rooms are fantastic the location right next to the cable car stop made getting around easy. the hotel is fairly new, only about five years old I think, so everything looks new and is very clean.We would stay there again next time in San Francisco for sure.

<Content>Great Spot for my first San Fran Trip I've never been to S.F. before and had no idea where to stay. I trusted the reviews on Tripadvisor and was not dissappointed. The Orchard is in a great spot in the city, close to the public transportation from the airports, nice staff, nice facilites, etc. with reasonable prices ($150 a night for a nice room with your AAA discount). After walking around the city a couple days, it seems like S.F. is small enough that no where is really so far from anywhere else, but when I do make it back, I'll rebook with the Orchard.

<Content>Wonderful -- Stayed at the Orchard for four nights. Asked for a higher level room and front desk staff were too happy to put us on the 9th floor facing Bush Street. Awesome. We were almost at the end of the hall with a fabulous view of Bush and Powell.What I found so nice was how quiet the hotel was. We never heard anyone next to us or above us.The beds were sumptuous with down filled pillows and comforters. I slept very well on the beds, but my husband had trouble with them being a little too firm for him.The location is priceless. It is close to everything. We were able to walk to all of the really fun stores like Saks, but we were still able to walk or run to Fisherman's Wharf. If you like to jog, you will get a huge workout on those hills!! I would highly recomment the Orchard. And I am usually pretty picky about hotels.

<Content>Wonderful hotel, will stay there again We found the Orchard hotel on Orbitz and decided to go with it since most other things were booked due to a conference in town. We could not have been happier with our luck. The hotel is wonderfully located, about 30 feet from the cable car lines and a 10 minute walk from the Moscone Center, Chinatown and a BART station. Our greeting by the front desk staff was terffic. They did not have a room ready yet (we arrived at 10:30AM) but took our bags, made some suggestions for Dim Sum lunch, and did a good job orienting us. Upon our return, our room was ready and the staff quickly brought our bags up. The rooms are very clean, spacious, and comfortable. The linens are great and the bathroom was huge. Great comfy robes with linings and slippers were very much appreciated. It was also well lit, which is a complaint of mine. More and more hotels seem to leave you in the dark with 25 watt bulbs.Breakfast was a very nice continental buffet with fresh fruit, baked breads, hard boiled eggs, sliced meats and cheeses, juices and great coffee. It was at our first breakfast that we had the honor to meet the owner Mrs. S.C. Huang. She is extremely unassuming, warm, brilliant person who is often in the dining room having breakfast with the guests. She shared many stories about the hotel and it's sister hotel, The Orchard Garden. The hotels are built in the loving memory of her husband and her daughter, both of whom she recently lost to cancer. The staff is extremely helpful with ideas for dinner spots, things to see, directions, and can arrange car services, taxis, and other transportation for you. Everyone seemed to be sincerely happy, so it appears it's a good place to work.I will definately be staying here the next time I come to town.

<Content>Great location, friendly and good value Orchard is in a great location between Union Sq and Chinatown. Also near the cable car. Rooms are good quality, staff friendly and a good complimentary breakfast of cereal, toasts, juice, cheese, ham, eggs and drinks. I stayed and then booked for the following weekend.

<Content>Excellent Value for San Francisco Good value for money in San Francisco at Powell and Bush.We stayed for 3 nights whilst touring the west coast and found the Hotel to be clean, modern and very well located.We didn't get around to trying the included breakfast as there were lots of other nearby places that we wanted to try, so can't comment on that.Room is very clean, very spacious (apparently remarkably so for San Francisco) with a very nice ensuite walk in bathroom with a massive walk in shower.The staff are friendly but also very professional, competent and helpful. The hotel owners obviously skilfully hand pick their staff.When we researched San Francisco hotels, it looked from the maps that location may have been a minus point. However, in reality, it is very well located for all the places that you want to explore, it is just that you wouldn't realize this until you actually stay here. Very good for Union square (shopping/cinemas), Chinatown, the financial area and Columbus/Broadway (Coffee shops) Nice touches, include complimentary robes and slippers in the rooms, along with an extensive free DVD rental library in the lobby.In short, an impressive independent hotel.Note: The owners have just opened another 'Orchard' hotel just down the road.

<Content>It was great! The hotel was lovely and the staff was outstanding. Every part of our stay here was pleasant. We arrived earlier than expected (nearly 2 hours before we were scheduled to check in) and they had our room ready for us anyway. They took our bags to our room and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. After unpacking we realized the comforter and pillows were down and we're both allergic to down. I called the front desk and asked for non-down blankets and pillows. Not five minutes later they were at our door.The room was very nice - very clean and had all the ammenitites we could ask for. We thouroughly enjoyed our stay at the Orchard Hotel and will be staying there later this year when we return to SF.

<Content>Highly Recommend this hotel My husband and I stayed at the Orchard Hotel for 4 nights before Christmas. We had a long flight from London and were both very jet-lagged so we were delighted with the friendly and efficient check in and the huge room with king size bed and every amenity to make our stay comfortable (luxurious bathrobes, French soap and body lotion, tea and coffee maker and CD/DVD player). Our room faced the back so it couldn't have been quieter. Breakfast each morning was a fabulous buffet and I was particularly happy with the fresh pineapple, watermelon and honeydew melon on offer. The staff were kind and helpful and the trolley to Fisherman's Wharf was right outside our door. We were also a 5 minute walk to Union Square. I would stay there again and highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to San Francisco.

<Content>Wonderfully charming hotel My fiancee and I stayed at the Orchard for 3 nights in August at the beginning of a 10 night - 5 hotel driving trip down the California Coast, and this was probably our favorite hotel (either this or the Omni in San Diego). The hotel was very warm and welcoming as soon we arrived and we got a terrific room on the 9th floor. The bed was definitely the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in and I slept wonderfully the whole time we were there. Great location in San Fran - short walk to Union Square and just a quick trolley ride (fun!) to the Pier. The breakfast was fine - ham, hard boiled eggs, fruit, yogurt, and breads were just enough to start our day since neither of us are big breakfast eaters, and the coffee was the best I had on the whole vacation. Take advantage of front desk recommendations - with so much in the area, we had no idea where to go one night we wanted Sushi. The gentleman at the front desk recommended this crazy little place a short walk away (though I can't remember the name!) and it was excellent. We never would've discovered it ourselves. Overall I thought it was a wonderful hotel, I have raved about it since we got home, and we were both very happy with our experience there.

<Content>Great choice The Orchard Hotel is a great choice if you're looking for value, location, service and cleanliness. We stayed for three nights in early December and were pleased with accomodations. Access to everything is reasonable - two blocks off Union Square and right on the trolley line. I've stayed in everything from luxury to economy hotels, and thought this was a good bang for the buck and definitely worth revisiting.

<Content>A great place to stay! The hotel is centally located in the Union Square area The cable car runs at the beginning of the block. It is beautifully appointed, with large rooms and bathrooms. We especially found the beds (platform) very comfortable and not too soft. Luxurious robes and slipper were provided.A expanded continental breakfast was included in the room rate. Cerals, breads fruit, yogurt, hard boild eggs sliced ham Nothing fancy but enough to fill up to last to a late afternoon meal.The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. They had full size umbrellas to loan for a rainy day.What I missed was an ample sized lobby for relaxing out of the room and for people watching. I would definately reccomend this hotel and I would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>What??? I just do not understand all the 5 star reviews. Even the Four seasons did not get so many perfect reviews. Trip advisor should investigate... This place is just a tiny standard Best Westernish type hotel. Something is so suspicious. There is absolutely 0 customer service and it is in a noisy old building. The double beds are twin platform beds!!! Look carefully at the reviews with less than 4-5 stars, these are truly the accurate ones. Will not stay again.

<Content>Overpriced and Overrated My boyfriend and I stayed here for three nights in November. It is true that this hotel is exceptionally clean and the rooms are spacious. However, the accoutrements are quite common and it does (as a previous reviewer stated) very much resemble a Holiday Inn. I was dissappointed because I was looking for a unique hotel with a special flair, and there was none. I also found the location to be somewhat dissapointing. The restaurants in the downtown area are terrible, and there is nothing to do except shop at the same stores found anywhere else in the US. You have to travel at least 3 miles to get to any SF point of interest. All in all, I would reccommend The Orchard to business travelers, but not to those looking for a weekend getaway or a SF vacation.

<Content>Stay Here! We did after reading the reviews  ditto all the positive comments. It was our first trip to San Francisco  we found all hotel staff extremely welcoming, helpful, very friendly  always eager to offer advice when asked. We didn't pre-book an airport shuttle but no problem, for $15.00 each we were at The Orchard within 1/2 hour. Our room, which was elegant  very clean, overlooked Bush St. but was very quiet. You can hear garbage trucks early in the morning, but the noise is short lived. The location can't be beat  we feel it was very good value after doing our homework on San Fran hotels. We had our best dinner during our 4 day stay in the hotel dining room (Vignette). Our young waiter even gave us a list of helpful hints re: public transit  popular cheap eats. For that matter... we found San Francisco full of very warm friendly people. We bought a 3 day Muni Pass  used the cable cars  buses often. The cable car drivers were all very jovial  very patient  helpful with tourists. We booked Alcatraz ahead of time  were glad we did. San Francisco  The Orchard Hotel will not disappoint!

<Content>One of the best This hotel is remarkable. The rooms are extremely large, especially the bath room. The decor is tasteful and serene. Having a DVD/Cd player in each room is a wonderful idea. It is perhaps the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff are unfailingly polite and helpful. When I needed help in printing a document, they were able to direct me to the right place in a twinkle of an eye. The complimentary breakfasts were bountiful and of a surprisingly high quality. The rooms must have been sound-proofed. Once inside, you don't hear a sound from outside. This is a terrific place to either work or unwind (I did both). It also is a bargain, especially given the ideal location.
