<Content>Perfect Stay We stayed for one night at the Imperial Hotel during a quick trip to Tokyo at the end of a business trip elsewhere in Asia. The service was superb and the staff uniformly helpful in helping us make the most of our brief time in Tokyo. The location was perfect for sightseeing. The room was extremely comfortable. We hope to return for a longer stay in Tokyo, and will definitely return to the Imperial Hotel.

<Content>Majestic! Stayed here for 2 nights last Dec. 22, '08. We were given a room at the 32nd floor of the Imperial Tower with the view of Ginza. The service is impeccable and the location is the best for us who want to be close to Ginza and train station which are few minutes walk from the hotel.

<Content>Imperial it is The Imperial Hotel was selected for me by my colleagues in Japan, because it was within walking distance of their offices. I was completely impressed with the hotel in every respect. The service was consistently excellent. I read in my guide book not to tip people, but I tried anyway, and the bellman absolutely refused. As an aside, the hotel is very sensitive to the needs of a novice like myself. The bellman always asked me where I was going, and told the cab driver in Japanese for me. That was immensely helpful. My room was on the tenth floor. It was large, modern and comfortable. The bathroom was particularly nice, with a shower with excellent water pressure, and a modern tub with jets. The toilet had a heated seat and bidet, the soaps smelled lovely, and the hairdryer was strong and hot. The room is equipped with sensors that detect your presence, and light up when you approach (for example, a panel next to the bed that controls opening the curtains, the sound in the room, etc.). My PDA was not working in Japan, so I could not use my phone or email. The hotel phone charges were very modest, and the business center has free internet access. They actually opened early for me one day (usually opens at 8). I ordered room service for breakfast, and it was prompt and very good. On my departure day, I went down to the cafe (which opens at 6am) and asked if I could possibly have a quick breakfast in 15 minutes. I had my food within 3 minutes, and had time to spare! Every person I encountered was professional, friendly and fluent in English. My feable attempts at Japanese were warmly acknowledged. I will absolutely stay here again the next time I am in Tokyo.

<Content>Imperial Service Long Gone I have stayed at the Imperial for over 15 years and it still manages to add something special to every visit. Yes there are flashier hotels in Tokyo now (Peninsula, RItz Carlton, Hyatt), but only the Imperial has this tradition and only the Imperial remembers to pay attention to detail that the others forget. Perhaps its the whiteness of the laundered shirts or the fresh fruit and flowers in the rooms or perhaps its the clatter of people from all levels of Tokyo society who mingle in the vast lobby adorned by a truly spectaluar feature wall. I can never really place my finger on what makes me come back to the Imperial time and time again .. and I think that's it - it is the service you never see but know is there - gently making your stay in Tokyo - perfect. The Imperial's reign is in no way diminished and she shall rule for many decades to come ...

<Content>Nice Enough This was our second stay at The Imperial Hotel due to business meetings and our overall hotel stay was pleasant. The Imperial definitely caters to the business traveler in light of its location and meeting space options. The staff is friendly and efficient.We stayed in a standard king size room located on the 31st floor in the Tower Annex and although the decor and furnishings were a bit dated and reflected wear and tear (i.e., worn carpet, worn and stained upholstery, scuff marks on furniture), everything was comfortable and clean. Being a business oriented hotel, we were surprised that the internet access was a bit spotty. We had a view of the train tracks and Hibiya Park. We did hear train noise even being on the 31st floor. The bathroom was large and the shower had great water pressure.Room service breakfast and coffee were fine and delivered promptly by friendly staff. I dined at the hotel's diner style restaurant (for lunch) as well as its tempura restaurant (for dinner) and the food and service were fine.The workout room is ok with some treadmills, a couple of stationary bikes, one elliptical, and three Cybex machines. All of the equipment was acceptable albeit not the most current models. Be sure to join the hotel's complimentary Imperial Club to access the gym at no fee and receive discounts on the hotel's restaurants.A minor concern was that the Concierge team was not overly welcoming and even appeared a bit unenthusiastic. When asked for recommendations and tips for some sightseeing, the concierge rushed through a few options, their access, and all with a dismissive attitude.Overall the Imperial Hotel provided a pleasant stay and their location is convenient to many areas, including the Ginza district. It's a very large, almost generic style of hotel, and understandably cannot provide personalized service. As far as stellar rooms, amenities, and staff, the hotel was fine but the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo is of much higher caliber in every respect.

<Content>Outstanding service! The service is the key that differentiates this hotel from others who are in the same price range. I have to admit that I am a complain and picky type of person. I have also been spoiled by living in Thailand where the service is always very good. The Imperial has impressed me big time with the attentive service.The room was nice and correct. It is not very big but has enough space for two to stay in comfortably. Bed was comfortable, features pillows and duvet. We were in a room that has been redecorated. So the room was new and not dated as in some reviews. They also had free internet (but not wireless). The shower was nice with seperate bath and shower and lots of amenities (but no body lotion - although I am sure if you ask, they can provide). The gym had good machines i.e. treadmill, cross-trainers etc. The in-door pool was nice and warm. I also liked their shower room at the gym.... the Japanese style shower area was nice. The hotel is located in good location with Hibiya tube station in front and 5 mins walk to Ginza area. There are also lots of restaurants around. So we did not try any restaurants in the hotel. They looked popular among the Japanese though.The only problem we had was that the staff didn't understand English very well. I called them to ask for some cotton pads but had to explained for a while. At the end, they sent some Shisedo moisturizer to my room (which was nice!). The day after, someone must have told them what 'cotton pad' was. So the maid put lots of them in my room and kept refiling them everyday (and also refilled the Shisedo!). All their staff was very attentive and extremely polite. So the English problem became minor and we were patient enough to repeat our sentences few times until they understood.In short, I really like this hotel and will definitely go back!

<Content>White gloved efficiency I stayed here on a business trip to Japan. The overwhelming impression on arrival was of the number of staff who seem to have nothing better to do than to hold doors open and bow to guests. Even the cleaners stopped whatever they were doing to bow and greet me every time I walked past.Reception was extremely smooth and efficient despite the fact that we arrived at about 10.00a.m. and we were soon given a room.The rooms are extremely well equipped, and comfortable, the rooms in the main part of the hotel being larger and better equipped than those in the tower. My room looked out over a busy railway line, and despite being on the 21st floor I could hear some noise from the railway. The rooms were reasonably priced for the class of hotel.The hotel has a great many restaurants, some serving Japanese food, while others offered international cuisine of a very high standard. However, the prices in the restaurants seemed high. Breakfast in the parkside diner was always very well prepared with prompt, efficient service. However, I found it slightly odd to be given broccoli with my bacon and eggs. The hotel is well situated within easy walking distance of the Ginza shopping area.Overall it was difficult to fault the hotel.

<Content>Truly high standard! First impression, visually, is a bit 1970's as you arrive and walk in, but instantly the highly efficient Imperial machine takes over, and you're in for a treat. Service is outstandingly high, delivered by extremely well-trained, helpful and courteous staff, without fail.Everything works, everything is clean, and it's perfectly located for either a walk or run in the park, for Ginza, or for Tokyo station.Join the (free) Imperial Club if you plan to stay more than once - the immediate benefits inlcude food discounts, free gym access, and half-price laundry. Take breakfast at the 17th floor restaurant - it's a fantastic buffet; dining in the hotel is generally expensive, but the Diner on the ground floor provides great value, and is actually fine to sit quietly and chill out after a hectic day's work or sightseeing, either on the 'Fixed price' dinner menu or an international carte. It's usually about half the price or less, of the other restaurants in the hotel.Rooms are top notch, slightly austere in appearance, but functionally excellent - try to get a park view or you'll be overlooking the railway, which is pretty busy.What could be better? More choice of TV channel would be good, and maybe a CD player in the room, but apart from that, go and enjoy.

<Content>royal past but needs updating This is the third or fourth time I've stayed here because my company gets a discount. It is located conveniently near the Imperial Palace, businesses, and subway lines. The Imperial has an illustrious history, but now it feels dated and worn. Everything looks a little old. I can't comment on the service because I didn't request any, but my colleagues have said it is good.One fun part of staying at the Imperial is sitting in the lobby and watching Japanese people in gorgeous kimonos attending weddings and other events. Often you will see a newly wedded couple getting pictures taken on the stairs. Overall, I would stay at another Tokyo hotel if it weren't for the company discount.

<Content>Very nice - great service Nice, higher end hotel tucked in between the edge of the publicly open part of the Imperial palace and Maruno-uchi/Tokyo station, this hotel offered me a nice, spacious room with a view, free hi-speed Internet, great location and awesome service. I always enjoy escaping America and leaving behind a culture of indiscipline and customer disservice from hotel employees. All employees at the Imperial (and typically ANY Japanese hotel) will offer helpful, friendly service with a thank you and a smile; the extra bene of the Imperial is that they also do it in English.I was in a spacious and clean room with a king bed and large bathroom on the 6th floor. Granted, one could simply go downstairs for a meal, but I suggest to the more daring to step out either down to the sublevel outside one block and grab a bite at one of the many places in the Metro underground, or exit out the back of the hotel, walk past the train line and one can find a multitude of little, tasty - and nicely priced - bakeries or breakfast shops and restaurants.In the tower extension of the hotel is a great Japanese style bath and sauna - ultra clean and perfect way to relax away (also not crowded - but do expect to pay 1,050 yen for the experience.All-in-all, this place has everything the travel needs - centrally located on the subway system, or a short walk to Tokyo station. I highly recommend the Imperial.

<Content>Baaaaaad attitude, just ok hotel The hotel is better than some in Japan, but not worth the money. A lot of attitude at the front desk and kind of old surroundings. Needs some updating of the interiors.I was staying on a business trip with others, and one day a colleague disappeared with my key while planning a presentation. When I went to the front desk, I got quizzed about why I needed an extra key. What happened to your key? I don't know, I think I lost it....I'm here with friends and one took the key... (etc) Apparently this was just too much for the front desk staff because they kind of freaked out. There was a lot of discussion in Japanese, and until I asked, What's the big problem? they did not tell me what was going on. Then they said, Oh, sorry sir, we will get you a key. Then they disappeared in the back and didn't come out for around 5 minutes.Then they gave me two keys and said, We'll have to charge you for the second key. !!!!!! They thought there was someone else staying in my room....Whatever. I guess Lost in Translation was a true story.

<Content>Good but some problems. We had great expectations from this hotel. The price, its reputation and the reviews we had read made us think that this was going to be a once in a lifetime experience. Nothing was wrong really, but we didn't have such experience. We found it to be a good hotel, very expensive, but apart from the impressive lobby we were not impressed. Room was large (for a double) but we had paid for a triple, and we found that the third bed was just a sofa bed which hadn't been made yet when we got to your room. Reception was quite impersonal, nothing wrong with it, but we were obviously not the type of customers the hotel caters for. We couldn't use the pool for free because we were not members of the club. We could not become members because we didn't have our business cards. Location isn't bad at all, it's a few minutes away from JR Yamanote line and the subway, but if you want ot go to Shinjuku you have a good half an hour travelling to do. Internet was available for free, but in a small room which had to be opened especially for you if out of business hours. If you are looking for a once in a lifetime experience like we were, then probably the New Otani Hotel will suit you better.

<Content>Incredible service We just returned from a Cruise West tour of Japan. Our final couple of days was at the Imperial in Tokyo. This is a classic old hotel beautifuly maintained and with the most service I've ever experienced in a hotel. The other hotels we experienced in Japan were 'Okuras and were excellent. We thought the service from them was great but the Imperial was in yet another class. There is no tipping in Japan but notwithstanding the staff was there virtually without asking or even necessarily being wanted. Certainly the Japanese folks frequenting the hotel seemed to expect the degree of service we observed, we though experienced travellers were somewhat amazed by it. The facility is excellent, the food venues were quite good, though as with most things in Japan expensive. We were given a 20% discount as hotel guests which helped. The rooms though excellent did not have irons and ironing boards in them though they were available for the asking. Other amenities of fine hotels were present. The hotel's distinguishing characteristics for us were location and service. The service excellence was enough to prompt this review.

<Content>Great location! Stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip, in the tower block. I was on the 28th floor, with a beautiful view of the city. The rooms here are a little tired, although I understand that there are some upgraded rooms elsewhere in the hotel. It is a very large hotel, so I had some trouble navigating within the hotel in the beginning.The best part about this hotel is its location. You can step right out into Ginza where all the shops and restaurants are. The train station is at the doorstep as well. Service is excellent. My only gripe is that they charge 1000Y for use of the gym.

<Content>Excellent Hospitality The Imperial Hotel is conveniently located across the street from the Imperial Palace grounds. The service and hospitality are unmatched. Hotel staff is everywhere and they go out of their way to help. We only ate breakfast there and the buffet was huge. It 's cool to see a chef make an omelet with chopsticks!

<Content>Super High-tech room in the Main Building! I have stayed at this hotel a few times. I got very luckey once and they upgraded me to a nice room in the main building, although I was paying for a single room in the tower building. While the room in the tower building is very decent, the renovated room in the main building was amazing. The room had two queen size beds with bench at the end, couch, coffee table, flat screen TV, fax machine etc. You could open/close the curtains by pressing the button on the night stand (actually, everthing is controlled by the panel on the night stand). There is a digital control panel on the wall for AC, and air purifier. The bathroom came with a tub that filled automatically to the temperature you like, and played a little music when it was filled, and oh, there was a small flat screen TV over the vanity. The room was so spacious it's almost as big as my apartment without the kitchen. The room service was excellent. I called for breakfast and it came within 5 minutes. Front desk personnel are always helpful with any request. Be sure to sign up for Imperial Club, if you are a foregin business traveler. That way, you can use fitness center for free, discount on dry cleaning etc. I've stayed at other hotels in Tokyo, but this one tops my list for location, service and comfort. I also like to run, so being close to a good running course like the loop around Imperial Palace is always a plus.

<Content>As close to perfect as you can get Stayed there three nights on the last leg of an around the world business trip. It may lack flair, but it is as close to perfect as a hotel can be. From the moment I got out of the taxi to the moment I boarded the Narita bus, everything was handled perfectly. The room was very comfortable鈥攕imple perhaps in its decor but a very elegant oasis for a tired traveler. The old Frank Lloyd Wright Imperial Bar is still there. If you are looking for flash, there are other excellent hotels but this place gets my vote. Also great location, right near the Ginza and a Tokyo subway as well as across forma part and near the palace.

<Content>Good hotel but found the colors so depressing Good hotel, great service but just not my kind of hotel..found the beiges and browns rather depressing and the walk through the hotel to get outside quite long..Of course that is what you can expect in such a big hotel..Location is really good!

<Content>Extraordinary Staff I've stayed at the Imperial Hotel several times and always found it to be a top-quality hotel. However, this last visit an incident occurred which showed me how helpful the staff can be. My colleague and I were schedule to catch an early bus to the airport. About 15 minutes before the bus was to depart, I became concerned that my colleague had not come down to the lobby yet. I asked the help desk to call his room - they told me the phone was busy, so I assumed he was awake and making a last minute phone call. Then without my prompting, the help desk began to investigate and found he had not responded to his earlier wake-up call. The manager in charge went up to his room and determined he was still asleep. He came back and asked my permission to wake him up. We both went back up to the room, woke him up and got him to the bus (which they managed to hold for us). At least 4 or 5 hotel staff helped us in the endeavor. Never have I seen such an extraordinary hotel staff.

<Content>Great Stay/Great Location Recently stayed 9 nights at the Imperial. Membership in the Imperial Club brought a 20% discount on a deluxe room as well as 50% reduction in laundry charges, and a 10% reduction on in-hotel restaurant charges and we used all of these.Room measureed approximately 23 X 26 feet not including the entry hall; bathroom the typical walk-in shower with separate tub measured 10 X 10. GREAT water pressure in the shower..you didn't want to get out it felt so good.The usual Imperial excellent housekeeping and wonderful service, particularly from the Concierge and the front desk folks.Pricey to eat in the Viking Sal buffet even with a discount and on some mornings there were a lot of folks eating and the table service a bit lacking; excellent choices in terms of food to include the made-to-order omelets.Airport limo to Narita can be arranged in-lobby and the hotel is that particular route's first stop. Metro connection across the street; Ginza shopping, Kabuki-za, lots of restaurants within a couple of blocks as well as convenience stores, small public park, etc.Lots of business folks (both Japanese and western) in the lobby every morning but also many Japanese travelers.If you like staying in this particular section of Tokyo, and we do, then the Imperial cannot be beat IMO. Pricey but worth it.

<Content>Stay at the Imperial, feel like royalty My stay at the Imperial Hotel was truly wonderful. It is centrally located, serviced by the Airport Limousine Bus regularly, very close to two subway stations and Ginza is only a short walk away. Moreover, the service is breathtakingly efficient. Hardly able to keep my eyes open after a 12-hour flight, check-in was completed in 2 minutes flat and I was led to my room immediately. The service is fabulous and staff seems to sense what the guest wants before he knows it himself. Whenever I walked into the lobby with so much as a questioning look on my face, staff immediately offered their assistance and if they could not help themselves, they would make sure their colleagues would attend to me immediately. I felt truly special. It is not a cheap hotel but worth splurging on.

<Content>Not worth the money I have been visiting Japan 2 - 3 times per year for over 10 years now and I have never been treated this poorly. The room I stayed in was old, I asked for a non-smoking room and they gave me a smoking room. Service is slow and of very poor quality for a Japanese hotel. If you are staying in Tokyo I would highly recommend the Palace hotel and Strings Hotel. The Palace is near Tokyo station and Strings is near Shinagawa station, both are very convenient.

<Content>Love the hotel The Imperial Hotel in Tokyo is an excellent place because of the location and great service. It is within walking distance to trains, Ginza shopping district, park, great restaurants (inexpensive and expensive ones) and movie theatres. Views from the room (Tower annex) are spectacular if you like to see end to end rooftops of buildings and skyscrapers. The view was better seven years ago. Used to be able to see the Odaiba (man-made island) and the Rainbow Bridge. Now new taller buildings are blocking a lot of the view. However, one can still get an unobtructed view of the railroad tracks where the infamous bullet trains run. Service personnel are top-notched. Most of the rooms have been updated. They must have used the Peninsula's interior designer. Room rates are lower than the other newer five-star hotels in the area. The only peeve I have with the hotel are the elevators. Although waiting time is almost nonexistent, they must do something about the climate control. One elevator can feel like a freezer while another feels like a sauna!

<Content>Utterly Superb Imperial Hotel TokyoThis hotel is undoubtedly the finest I have ever stayed in. It is one of the very few I shall remember for all the right reasons. It is also the most expensive hotel I have ever stayed in, but it was not 鈥榦ver the top鈥?expensive 鈥?better value than London or New York. I found a variety of different prices for this place, but I found the best deal was with the hotel direct 鈥?they seemed to have some special deals on when we booked and these couldn鈥檛 be beaten. Some people may be put off by its sheer size 鈥?it is hugeWe were lucky enough to have got an upgrade from a 鈥楳oderate鈥?to a 鈥楧eluxe鈥?on the 14th floor of the main building, and it probably is the only time in my life I have walked into a hotel room and said 鈥淲OW鈥? I sense the reason we got the upgrade was due to a tip I received to become members of the Imperial Club. This is free, and definitely worth it. I obtained my membership through their London office, and it was conducted by fax. It also offers additional benefits such as 10% off any restaurant bill and free use of the very excellent and utterly spotless leisure facilities. The room was incredible. A large 32鈥?LCD TV, every conceivable comfort feature you could wish for 鈥?including would you believe it a toilet with a heated seat and various options such as 鈥榖idet鈥?and 鈥榮pray鈥?settings!! The detailed touches were also memorable, such as courtesy lights under the bedside units, which were useful if you needed to go to the loo in the night without disturbing your partner. In addition to the bedside lamp, there was also a bedside reading lamp, which was very directional, again so you could read without disturbing your partner. The service was almost too much! The staff seemed almost to fall over themselves to help. It must have one of the highest staff to guest ratios I have ever come across. There were ladies on the floor who greeted you as you stepped out of the lift. Despite the busy location, we never heard any external noise. I note others have recommended use of the Limousine Bus service to and from the airport. We used this, and can only endorse the other positive views. (Believe a taxi is eye wateringly expensive). We used the metro system to get around. Once tuned into the system, it was quick, cheap, and efficient. Stations names are in Japanese characters as well as Roman, so no problem there, although streetmaps were a bit daunting as not all streets have names, and there is little logic to the numbering system. However, the Hotel provided a useful map which identified landmarks to help you (eg the hotel itself, the Sony building etc.)We ate in on one evening out of the three we were there. I was quite expensive, but the meal was excellent. There are about 12 restaurants to choose from offering different types of cuisine include French, Chinese and Japanese. If you do find the prices a bit over the top, there are numerous restaurants in the immediate vicinity at varying price levels. Breakfasts too were very good. Overall, although fairly expensive, I would still describe it as good value. I always ask myself would 鈥淚 stay here again?鈥?An unhesitating 鈥榊es鈥?

<Content>Reliable, Great Location We often stay at the Imperial and I agree with the other reviewers: it has a somewhat dated look (which I like) and it's very centrally located. All I want to add is that the staffing levels and service very impressive given how expensive Japan is. There are always loads of people around to answer questions and help out and the concierges are very helpful. Also, we tried some of the hotel restaurants this time around and really liked them. I adore wandering the back streets of Ginza while my husband is working and have bought many Japanese prints from Watanabe's little shop and gorgeous housewares from Matsuya department store. It's lovely to have the park right in front and there are plenty of places to eat nearby. Coffee drinkers may be pleased to know that Starbucks is right next door.

<Content>My First Tokyo Hotel The Imperial Hotel was the first hotel I ever stayed at in Japan. I was 9 years old accompanying my father on a trip. He had been gone from home a lot and with Vietnam heating up, knew he would be gone a lot more so he took me along for some quality father/son time. Ever since then the Imperial has been a favorite of mine. There are things I like better about the Hotel Okura and especially the Palace Hotel, but the Imperial will always be first in my heart.And it remains there because they do a darn good job of anticipating every need a businessman might have. I also love the pool area and the restaurants.

<Content>Register for the Club... Foreign travellers should register for the Imperial Club, at the hotel website, before departure. I have been to this hotel over 10 times over the past 15 years, and I just discovered you can register online if you are a foreign guest. This gets you an upgrade (I believe) to the club floors, which are better rooms (read -- updated) than the regular rooms. They are also larger, I believe, and the bathroom is much, much nicer. The Club also comes with other perks and discounts.Service is the high point at this hotel, and the convenient location next to Business, the Palace and Ginza. The rooms are an afterthought. Food is famously expensive at the hotel, but a quick step outside of the hotel will yield dozens of restaurants of every type and price point, with most restaurants priced very affordably (for a Californian). Other tips:The Limosine Bus stops directly at the hotel, which I prefer to the Narita Express due to the convenience of a single stop.

<Content>More than good but not excellent Stayed 5 nights at Imperial Hotel Tokyo for my business trip in Feb and have some comments as follow :Location : excellent location if you work around Tokyo and Ginza Station. But it is not convenient going to shopping and leisure places in Tokyo downtown, ie, Shinjuku and Roppogi.Reception : Most of them can speak excellent English upon check-in. They were fast and efficient but without any warm greeting. Ladies at Guest Relations are supreme - could answer me every single questions. If they were not sure, they checked with the collegues or searched at the internet to find it out. And they helped me book an excellent Japanese restaurant with my boss in the evening. Conceige : I needed to be patient with them as some of them cannot speak English well. The day I left was the day of Tokyo Marathon, most of the roads around the hotel were blocked for the Campaign. I was told I needed to take Limo bus at the temperory bus stop at the back entrance upon check-out. When I asked to get back my lugguges after going back from lunch, the bell boy brought them to the front entrance but he could not explain it to me very well so I needed to ask couple staffs to find out the campaign was finished and every arrangement was back to normal. Room : Our rooms are located at the top floor of New Wing. We thought we were upgraded to the better room category. Unfortuately, they are same quality as the rooms at the other floors. The bell boy told us we would be upgraded if we becomes members of the hotel. Room is spacious and clean but with 80's deco. I think it matches with the overall deco of the hotel. Bedding is a concern - mattress and pillow are too soft to me. They do not provide duvet during winter (I have requested about it) and it's polyester/cotton heavy qulit with the small cotton flat sheet underneath which made me uncomfortable and needed to adjust it all over the night to avoid any contact with the quilt. Restaurant : average quality but expensive, cheese platter (with 3 half finger size cheese and it's not tasty) at about 1800 yen plus tax ; about 1500 yen plus tax of a glass of house wine. Fortuately, I got a 20% off coupon for the meal or beverage during check-in. Tips : I found aroung 40-50 restaurants and bars at the road just in front of the hotel. Most of them closed late and food is reasonable and not expensive relatively.

<Content>good but not so good I spent 3 nights in an imperial floor room in January. There was some confusion with my booking which was quickly sorted out. Check - in was rushed and very average - there was a huge queue which moved along quickly.My room was very nicely appointed with a great view. There was a special attendant who rushed to offer any assistance when required . It is a huge hotel - and the lobby was always crowded . The bell staff were unfriendly and unsmiling - not even in response to a greeting/hello.Location is great - walking distance to underground staion as well as to Ginza.

<Content>Average Business Hotel This hotel is huge. It was hard to get around and took about 10 minutes for us to get to our rooms...especially since there was only one route. The rooms are basic and are in need of renovations. Everything was old, including the TV and channel/movie selections. The location was great...within walking distance to the Hibiya Line (subway) and the JR Yamonote Line (train). It was also in Ginza, which has a lot of nice stores and restaurants. The concierge service was very good and there was always someone available to help us. However, I don't think it's a good value. I think there are many nicer hotels in this price range.

<Content>As everyone says - it's great! My family and I stayed at the Imperial Hotel for two nights. We stayed at the Snoopy Heartful Stay Suite, which was a suite based on Snoopy, the World Famous Beagle who appears in the Peanuts comics. Once you went inside, there was a very cute Snoopy interior mat. There was a sofa, and two armchairs beside it. On one armchair, was the biggest Snoopy stuffed animal I had ever seen! It was so big it would suffocate a baby if he slept with it. On the table were two tote bags with gifts inside. It was a tiny cheese plate and a mug cup! There were also two coupons for Snoopy pancakes at the Eureka Restaurant - 10% off! We never got to using them because we were so busy in Tokyo - shopping, and all that stuff. The beds were very comfortable and I got a very much needed sleep. The blankets had Snoopy, Charlie Brown, and Woodstock carefully embroidered. On each of our two beds was a Snoopy and Charlie Brown cushion. In the bathroom, there was a Snoopy hairdryer! And beautiful Snoopy bathrobes and towels. Now, besides the Snoopy suite which excited us so much, the dining here is wonderful. The buffet (or viking) is wonderful. Be sure to try their ham there, if possible. It's wonderful! If you get the half grapefruit, it's carefully cut so that it is easy to spoon out each piece. The value is well worth it. It's kind of pricey, but you get what you pay for. The service here is extreme!!!!! Everyone treats you like royalty, and like you are some celebrity. Overall, it was an awesome stay, my family loved it, and I highly recommend it!!!!

<Content>Certainly the best hotel I've ever stayed at! Having lived in Japan for a number of years, I can tell you that no other hotel gets the same reaction from the locals as the Imperial. Tell a Japanese person that you鈥檝e stayed there and they will give you a look that comes dangerously close to wonder. Of course, reputation is one thing, reality is another. Recently my wife and I were invited to stay there by my visiting mother-in-law. As the title of the review states, I was pretty impressed 鈥?although I would point out that I don鈥檛 usually stay at top of the range luxury hotels that often鈥?The hotel is huge (1000+ rooms! 13 restaurants! bars! shops!), the service was impeccable (and in English), the rooms were comfortable and fully equipped, and the food at the restaurants we sampled was excellent, although expensive. The location too is very convenient, within walking distance of a range of train and subway stations giving you easy access to the rest of the city.So if you鈥檙e in Tokyo and have some cash to burn, do yourself a favour and book in 鈥?and try the mixed western/Japanese breakfast buffet at the Viking restaurant while you鈥檙e at it. Mmm鈥?delicious...

<Content>Teikoku (Imperial) Hotel - The very best The Grand Dame of Tokyo Hotels. Elegant, Frank Lloyd Wright design, superb location, impeccable service, history - the Teikoku Hotel (Japanese name) has it all. Tsukamoto-san, the General Manager, is a true gentleman. I have stayed here several times both by myself and with my family and I am looking forward to my next visit.

<Content>Great Stay The Imperial Hotel is an extremely large hotel that's always swarming with activity. My family and I stayed for four days and there was a huge wedding or other large function each night. We enjoyed the activity but those seeking a tranquil setting should stay elsewhere. The service is terrific. As for the rooms, the Imperial is two hotels in one. The standard rooms, particularly in the new wing, have decor/furnishings comparable to a Holiday Inn - clean and not cramped but definitely not fancy. Rooms on the Imperial Floors in the main building are completely different and rival those found in Ritz Carltons but you're charged commensurately. We enjoyed our stay very much - especially the location which is adjacent to the Imperial Palace and walking distance to Ginza.

<Content>Great Service! Just came back from a 3 nights stay at the Imperial Hotel. This is my children's first visit to Japan and both of them were very impressed when the greeting ladies bowed every time our elevator door closed on the G/F.We booked a room with 3 beds, and when we arrived and told them that our children will share a bed, Housekeeping came within 5 minutes and provided everything for the 4th person in the room. When he saw the children, he immediately brought slippers in children size. Truely 5 class service.Not to mention a great location. We had fun choosing between all the restaurants underneath the railway track.For sure we will go back to the Imperial next time we are in Tokyo.

<Content>Convenient Business Hotel Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Imperial. It is a very large business hotel that does a sizable wedding business on weekends. As tourists, we were happy with the hotel's location near reasonable and fun restaurants (yakitori joints under the rail tracks), lots of shopping (think Ginza), and access to metro lines. Though staff was exceedingly courteous, we found the concierges to be especially helpful. Most standard rooms are located in the new Tower building. Our room was large and decorated in dated colors and furnishings but everything was in tip top shape. Most Tower rooms have fabulous views of the Ginza, especially at night. It is a long walk to the Tower rooms from the main lobby, however. The convenient location will bring us back to the Imperial on future trips to Tokyo.
