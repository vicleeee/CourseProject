<Content>Very bland, but clean and close to transport We stayed at the Mercure but did not know much about Berlin or what was a nice , pictuesque area to stay in. This is not a picturesque area to stay in. The hotel itself was quite reasonable. The rooms were comfortable and clean. However, the reception staff would not speak or greet you unless you directly approached them, and even then, we felt like they didn't really want to offer any help. The hotel is located very close to a subway station, but we didn't hear any noise from the subway. The hotel is not really super close to anything else, including restaurants or shops, and the walk to the shops at night is quite dark and a bit scary. Overall, the hotel would be fine for a short stay.

<Content>Nice hotel and quiet location The street in which the hotel is located is very calm. Underground station is about 100 meters from the front door.I stayed in a room facing the inner garden on the 4th floor. It was very quiet, had a good heating system, good space in the room, nice bathroom. I had dinner in the hoteléº“s bistrot twice and it was quite good. Staff is very friendly and helpful.The only problem I had was with the WiFi Internet connection that was not constant and had many interruptions

<Content>Clean Room  I spent 3 nights at the Mercure Hotel Mitte in late August 2008. The staff was friendly, the rooms were clean and the breakfast (which was included in the price I paid for) was excellent! The location of the hotel is convenient as well; it is a 2 minute walk to the train station and a 15-20 minute walk to Potsdamer Platz.There were no restaurants nearby but this was not a negative for us as we dined near the areas we did sightseeing in. Overall, this hotel was a great value for the money and I would definitely stay here again.Note: There was no airconditioning although it was not a necessity during my stay. My room had a fan and windows which could be opened. My friend's room did not have a fan but the windows could be opened.

<Content>Great for a 3 day break We stayed at the Mercure hotel for 3 nights in July. We found an excellent price online and were a bit sceptical about how good the hotel would be, however, it was excellent! Rooms were spotlessly clean and very spacious. Bathrooms are lovely, showers are great. Bed was comfy and there was no noise from outside. Location is okay, the underground station Gleisdreieck is just across the road, so it was easy to get around. I would definitely stay here on my next trip to Berlin.

<Content>Really nice! Very nice. Ordered the stay over the net. Very nice location, 50 metres from a U-Bahn station (Gleisdreieck) and along a quiet street. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel looks very recently refurbished or almost new. Our room had a nice bed, a small desk, a TV with lots of channels and a tiled bathroom. Everything was very clean, and roomkeeping friendly. Breakfast was a bit on the expensive side, but well worth it. Fresh pressed juice, fresh bread and a good selection of ham, cheese, fruits etc.I will definitely check the price next time I'm going to Berlin and stay here one more time if I get a good offer.

<Content>I'd be happy to come back Wanted to go back to Germany as I had visited other parts before and was impressed. Decided on Berlin because of its historical facts and again I was pleasantly surprised. Initally had help at the train station and everyone continued to be of help and assistance. The hotel is situated next to the underground and is only two stops from the Potsdamme Platz. The Sony Centre is situated here and is a must to see. If you want a walk, it will take you about 15 min. The hotel was very clean and tidy and was exceptional value for money. The staff were helpful and friendly and the bar is open late. Would recommend a guided tour with Berlin Walks [--]. Our guide was very informative and you see and learn all about the city, without wandering round aimlessley. Considering Berlin is a capital, prices round the city are very resonable. All in all another unforgetable trip.

<Content>comfortable and ideal location My husband and I travelled to Berlin and stayed at this hotel which is just two stops on U2 from Zoological Garten. It was well connected and on the whole a comfortable budget hotel. We did not have any meals there as it was easy to go to either Potsdamer Platz or any other central location. It is right next to the Technical Museum too. Bright orange decor, the staff was helpful and the room was comfortable and modern.

<Content>Great place to stay Concidering the price we paid when we booked this hotel from at bookingcompany, we got much more than we had hoped for from a 3-star hotel. Our room was spacius, comfortable, quiet and clean. Right outside our room was a little quiet garden with tabeles and chairs. Breakfast was good. The staff were all polite and helpfull. The hotel is situated a few meters from the U-ban that take you to Potsdamer Platz in 7-10 min. Great location to explore the city. We had a day-card that gave us access to all public transport inside Berlin, and used this every day. But we also used bike to get around to the most popular places. Recomend this way to get around, but stay away from rush-hour! Many popular places such as Potsdamer Platz, Brandenburger Tor, Checpoint Carlie are easy to reach from this hotel. The hotels nearest sourroundings are not much, but since the hotel itself is new and cosy, and it is easy to reach all you need by public transport or walking, we diden`t se this as a problem.

<Content>much better than awaited Very good and quite small hotel. Clean and modern, rooms are big enough and very well equiped. It looks modern and is in a very good condition. Breakfast is pretty rich, they even serve fresh orange juice, which is not that common in a 3 *** hotel. There is an only 10 min walking distance to Potsdamer Place, even though the actual hotel area is not that nice. On the other hand, there is a metro station just in front of the hotel which makes it very easy to get to anywhere in the city even in the traffic jam time.On the whole: in most other countries the hotel would possibly receive 4 stars!

<Content>OK but might not go back Booked here for a good value stay. Having used Accor hotels before I didn't expect any issues but mine started when I arrived. Apparently my booking had been changed so that I arrived a day earlier. Just as well I had my email from them which showed that I hadn't! So after much huffing and puffing and a swear word, I got my key. The room was tiny - considering I had booked a room for 1 or 2 people, I was surprised when it only had a single bed! But no problem.To be fair to the hotel, the room was clean and comfortable, bathroom was fine and the range of TV channels was excellent - it includes BBC World which is a better alternative for me than CNN. The room did get very warm and given the current hot weather that Berlin is suffering, I struggled to get a good night's sleep. The double glazing kept out most noise but as the courtyard gets busy first thing in the morning, you couldn't keep the window open overnight for ventilation. No air-con is provided and in the summer it's needed.Breakfast was excellent as were the staff serving here - very friendly and helpful. Gleisdreick U-Bahn has good connections though getting to the main railway station is a bit of a long winded journey.Overall not bad.

<Content>Wonderful stay We booked the hotel through accorhotels.com.The hotel is located in a very quiet neighbourhood, next to the U-bahn station that will take you to the city center in less than 5-10 minutes. 10 minutes was the longest we had to wait for a train to arrive, so that's perfect.The staff were very friendly and helpful, it was no problem to drop off our luggage before going back to the airport, and their english was good.The room was nice, quite a big bathroom with a nice warm shower, and the sleeping part was good as well. The beds were good, there was hardly any noise from outside or inside the hotel.We had a wonderful stay, and if we ever go to Berlin again, we will go back to this hotel!

<Content>Cute and Quiet If you want a rather quiet area in the heart of Berlin, this is a great hotel! Staff were very nice when we checked in and always greeted my partner and I every time we would walk in or leave the premise. Yes, there is nothing much to do in and around the hotel once 8pm hits, so it's always good to to have a snacks and drinks handy if one ever gets hungry or thirsty.Very convienent to the Gleisdrieck U-Bahn station, however, be prepared to walk a lot of stairs at this station!!! There's no elevator or escalator at this station. Do pay attention since BVG is updating the lines and made it a bit confusing getting around the city at first.Overall, would definitely consider this hotel again on a return visit to Berlin!

<Content>Quiet location, excellent service We have used Mecure hotels in Germany before and always get good value and good service and this hotel was no exception The hotel itself is located in a quiet spot, next to a U-Bahn station so acess to the whole city is good. The room was clean and tidy and public areas (bar, breakfast room, courtyard) were comfortable and well decorated. The reception service was very good, helping with tickets and directions, incidentally all staff spoke good English which put my pigeon German to shame. Berlin itself is a very large city, with far too much to see in one weekend, so recomend a bus tour (which the hotel arranged for us) just to get to a taste of what is on offer.

<Content>Ok for sleeping, not much more. Stayed there for five days during the Berlin Film Festival. It's conveniently located in some aspects- it's just about 60 seconds from a subway stop, and it's only a 10-15 minute walk from Potsdamer Platz.But the amenities leave something to be desired. My room was ok, but very small, and the bed was very hard and uncomfortable. The wireless internet was a disaster, and since I was there on business, I wound up spending a lot of the evening in the lobby, as that was the only place to get a signal.Once 9pm hits, there is nowhere around to get any food- even the gas station on the corner is closed. You're either in a cab or the U-bahn, but if you're going for tourism and not for business, you're probably not going to be sitting at the hotel anyway. The on-premises bistro isn't very good, and only has three options for dinner. The breakfast buffet is OK, but there are generally only three hot items- mildly stale eggs, sausage, and some sort of fried potato or meat dish. There's a good swath of meats and cheeses, though, so you'll be ok.In the end the place is clean, quiet, and generally nice. The staff is helpful, and the rooms are great for the price. But it's a super-sleepy part of town, so don't expect to get far on foot without investing 10-15 minutes.

<Content>good hotel and location I read the reviews and was concerned about the location before we arrived. Although the area is very quiet with very little nearby, the hotel was actually ideally located. It takes less than a minute to walk to the metro where lines 1 and 2 intersect. These lines take you to all the main tourist sites in Berlin. You can travel West to Charlottenburg (4 stops) and Nollendorfplatz (2 stops) for good places to eat and East to the major tourist sites and more restaurants around the Kreuzberg area. The hotel was clean, spacious and cheap if booked on the internet. Also had no problems extending our stay while we were there and the staff gave us the cheapest rate irrespective of the current price on the internet.Would definitely recommend it for value for money, and location.

<Content>Good value Nice hotel. Simple, but comfortable. Seemed to be situated in a quiet neighborhood. As mentioned in other reviews, just a short walk to Gleisdreieck subway stop. Not much else nearby. Courtyard and lobby areas are nice places to sit and relax, even though they weren't spacious. Didn't really spend much time in the hotel, as I was exploring the wonderful city, but was able to sleep peacefully.Would probably stay there again.

<Content>Ok hotel with good location We got this hotel pretty cheap and had a good stay. The hotel isn't located in the absolute center of the city but is very close to the subway. Breakfast was plentiful and tasted good. Only downside was that our room got really hot and couldn't be cooled very easily.

<Content>Modern hotel in Berlin We stayed for 3 nights in August 2005. The hotel is located approx 200m from the railway station. It's a fairly new hotel, and the rooms are very modern, with a huge marble bathroom and very comfortable beds. You can't really walk to any restaurants - need to take the u-bahn a few stops.Two issues: for one day the water was brown - the hotel knew about this when we advised them. And we couldn't open the windows at night due to a mosquito plague.I booked the hotel online through a booking agent - there was no problem doing this.
