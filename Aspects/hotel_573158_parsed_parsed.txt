<Content>Great value hotel not far from town centre. Stayed 7 nights together with my young family. Great location, easy to reach by tram, tram stop is right outside the hotel's main entrance. The hotel also provide a complementary shuttle bus service which pass Macau terminal and Hong Kong airport express station, the service operate between Monday to Saturday.If you do not care to use the Hotel's laundry service, there is a laundry just opposite the hotel, almost next to the Circle K convenient store. 7 lb (3 kg) cost 28 HKD for wash only service.

<Content>Better than expected On the basis of other reviews I was a little concerned about what I would find; however I was pleasantly surprised. Stayed 9 nights over xmas/NY. It was easy to find - 15 mins on the tram from the airport express station - $2HKD. Easy check in at 1030am. Had a harbour room suite - nice views and thankfully the Marriott over the road didn't block the view too much - although they need to tell their customers people from this hotel can see straight in their windows!!!The bed was firm but comfortable; the room was clean and well maintained during out stay. The bathroom and shower unit were somewhat small and the TV looked about 15 years old but on the whole I found the hotel to be great value for money.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised Got a great rate from rates to go, upgraded to suite (although it was two single beds). The view wasn't special but very Hong-Kong. I actually liked the location a lot. Short taxi from the Airport Express. It's right on a major throughfare with taxis and trams (taxis are so cheap in HK), it's next to some really interesting markets and not too far of a walk from SoHo.  I was pleasantly surprised and would definitely stay there again, at least if the rates I received were the same.

<Content>Cheap and ok. My partner and i stayed here when we spent a week in Hong Kong in April before going to Thailand. We chose the hotel because it looked good value for money. Our view was we didnt want to pay a lot for a hotel that we did not intend to do more than sleep in. That is who this hotel is good for, dont expect full luxury. The hotel is away for the very touristy areas of Hong Kong, it was within easy walking distance of the harbour and other attractions (as most things are in Hong Kong). The hotel itself was nice, the lobby was very clean and was always busy, the staff were helpful. The room was very clean with good air con, the bed was large and firm. I only have one complaint about the hotel and that was its location, it is very close to the fish packing district. This isnt a problem in the hotel itself but if you wish to walk anywhere rather than get a taxi it can get quite smelly especially in the hot weather. Apart from one very noisy night due to business men in the next room, which i complained about and the staff sorted out, a nice hotel and we would probably use it again if we were on a budget just passing through Hong Kong.

<Content>reasonably priced hotel away from touristy areas Just completed a 2 week stay at this hotel Nov/Dec.Contacted directly with hotel manager months ago via e-mail for a little under US$90/day for a harbor suite (20th Fl) with partial harbor view (partly blocked by tall building in front). Picked this location (Western District) because have seen this hotel previous year and also very familiar with this area in HK. And thought price was extremely reasonable for its value and not looking for 5 stars hotel which can cost several hundred US per night and not really planned on spending a whole lot of time inside the room anyway.Before I start, lets preface for anyone who is considering this hotel, location can be a challenge or wont be a challenge depending on how one views it. For me, it is not. Being able to speak Cantonese obviously is a plus but not entirely necessary since I've seen plenty of Caucasians in and out of this hotel and staff and concierge do speak enough English to guide you. As far as convenience to transportation I thought it is not a problem at all. Tram station eastward to Sheung Wan (1st MTR station) is few steps across the street on Des Voeux Rd and take only 5-10 minutes to MTR subway. And trams run frequently towards pretty much the entire north side of HK island. Taxi is also available either ask hotel staff or wave one down on the street and cost is relatively cheap to get to Central for example. But I've used exclusively the Tram (HK$2 each ride) to get most part of northern HK Island since I wasn't in a hurry and used MTR subway if I need to go fast or access other part of HK.Arriving from airport to hotel I used Airport Express train which cost $160 for 2 on a promotion (25 minutes to Central below IFC and just few steps to taxi station) then about another HK$25 cab ride with all luggages to hotel. Have considered using either A-10/A-12 bus but to save less than HK$100 with all luggages it wasnt worth it. (But heard that bus ride would give a good view along the way towards HK Island during that one hour ride).Meals: didnt use any in the hotel and checked out their breakfast buffet (under $60) and it was standard Western fare, not huge spread. I prefer to explore the neighborhood which has plenty of choice for local cuisines of all kinds and very inexpensive but good. For westerners, that maybe a challenge since most of these places don't have English menus or English speaking staff. However, a short $2 tram ride will bring you to Central where there are plenty of choices (Starbucks, MacDonalds, Fairwoods, most Western hotels etc) with more familiar cuisines available as well as fancy ones that can be found in IFC, Pacific Places etc. or across the harbor in Ocean Terminal, Nathan Rds areas hotels etc.Beds: opinions differed here depending on person. Yes the bed was more firm than many hotels in the US but I didn't find it to be uncomfortable. The room was adequate in size for HK standard with bedroom and sitting room partitioned off. TV is in the living room. Shower was a cubicle (spaced age) design kind of like in a cruise ship. Again, not looking for 5 stars luxury here.Internet was available on 3 rd Fl where breakfast buffet was. Rate at HK$25/hour or $45/3 hours. Staff are quite helpful and knowledgeble if asked.Elevators (3) are a little small especially have many luggages to carry or during check in/out time. Otherwise no problem there most of the time.Neighborhood is on the older side of HK and can be quite charming if one is looking for what HK used to look like and access in and out that area to other part of HK is really not a big problem.

<Content>Excellent Stay!!!!!!! Firstly, please ignore any negativity vented towards this hotel by disgruntled, and frankly, delusional travellers....this place is first class!!!Granted, it ain't the Peninsula or 4 Seasons, but for the cheap rate in HK, it's surpassed all our expectations.....Room was a twin standard and gave us an enjoyable, comfortable, and most importantly, spacious stay in the city.....now we didn't have a harbour view, but honestly, who comes to HK to stare out the window??Location was a mere 15 mins from Causeway Bay, and for those who begrudge the location, there's a feeder bus which will take you directly to the Central MTR station.......and plus, taxi's are well cheap here so, there was never any concern about location...Service was immaculate, and I would give this place full marks for just about everything....definitely would stay again!! Enjoy

<Content>Love and hate Ramada I am a native Hong Konger. This hotel is in Kennedy Town where I was born. so I thought it would be nice to stay there for old time sake. Turned out the room was nice and clean. It is the only good thing about this hotel. I got a good rate for this hotel back in 2005, that's why it wasn't so bad. If you are paying 2008 price, I would not stay there at all. Why?Bad location. It is at the west end of Hong Kong island, truly a residential area. No subway, very inconvenient. Every night, we had to either take the subway to Sheung Wan and then took another tram ride to get to the hotel or we would take mini-bus from Causeway Bay. It was ok the first couple of days but it got tiresome. If you are not Chinese, cannot speak or read Chinese, you may have a tough time figuring out the transportation. Taxi is not cheap in Hong Kong. Traffic is always bad. For the same cost, you can find decent hotels in more convenient locations. The rooms may not be as big or new as Ramada but you won't feel like you are wasting a lot of time commuting.That said. You can find lots of cheap places to eat in the neighborhood. Mostly local Hong Kong style cooking, yummy.I would not stay there again because of the bad location.

<Content>This place is a joke,,, The price of the rooms and suite is perfect.. cheap price..quailty mmmm... not goodI booked a standard room but got upgraded to the presdential suite...The suite is huge but a joke... Big living room but no tv lol... dont understand that really...the sleeping area is so so... the fake wooden floor is a joke.. it was half broken and when you walked on it.. it made squeeking sounds.. the toilet was huge but strange..you had a toilet room but no washing basin for after using the toilet.. you had to go in the next room which there was a huge room with just one basin for washing hands and thats all.. very strange design..the suite was very dark.. not much lights.. the service was a joke, there was a dvd/cd player.. quite confusing to use so called the tech guys and they send 2 normal tech guys and they had no idea how to use it so send the head guy in the tech department and had no idead how to use it... this took 30 minutes after that they ask the manager to come up and see if he knows how to use it.. in 5 minutes he came up spend about 15 minutes.. he still didnt know how to use it.. so he came up with a real good reason and i was pissed but kep my calm .. guess what he said.. He said mmm we dont know how to use this thing but it dosent matter because you got upgraded so you were suppose not to have this equipment so deal with it.. well good luck to people who actually book this suite and ask them to come up and help...guess the manager have to think of another reason to tell the guest..

<Content>Not so nice location, rooms are good Stayed here for 2 days. The good thing is the room was clean and nice. Cant say as much for the other parts of the hotel or the location itself. We paid for a harbour view suite but could not see anything, I dont even remember a Window being there. The tariff was quite high, more than double of what we pay in Malaysia and it didnt even include free breakfast. Would probably not stay there again.

<Content>Beware - windowless rooms ! Hong Kong is tough for hotels, and if you are caught out, as I was on this Fiday evening, then you are stuck with places that have significant problems, like this one. There are two key problems with this hotel, the first one - location - I didn't care about and reasonable due diligence will tip off the prospective guest. It's in Western District, about 10 minutes from where you would probably want to be, but that's OK. The second one, however - lack of natural light/windows in the room - was shameful and quite a nasty shock to me when I booked in. I can only assume that the hotel has given up on trying to nurture guest loyalty, and is just milking it for what it's worth through first timers who naturally assume that the hotel room will have a window. To hotel management: guys, it's perfectly acceptable to sell a box without a window to your paying guests, but completely unacceptable to neglect to let people know about this fact when they book the room on wotif or whatever booking site they use. Shame on you. I was in the middle of a somewhat stressful project when I camped here for a night and I needed a windowless room like a hole in the head. Thanks a lot guys. I am so disgusted that I am now going to go out of my way to turn people away from your hotel and will waste plenty of management time with complaints to Ramada regional management. Have you no sense of decency ?!?!? I really hope your hotel goes down the tube and rest assured I will do what I can to help it on its way.

<Content>Good Hotel for the price The rooms at this hotel are quite nice, considering the number of cheap deals available. However, the beds are rock hard. Like sleeping on concrete. And the shower is a bit of a challenge, its quite small. But the room is well furnished, and I would consider staying here again.... although the prospect of sleeping on that bed another night might turn me off! Only a short tramride to Central, with a tram stop right out front of the hotel. Reasonable location. If they could only organise a comfortable bed.... The staff were friendly and helpful, and spoke English. If you like a firm bed, consider this property...

<Content>Good pricing for long stay I contacted the hotel directly to enquire on the rates and was surprised that the rates were slightly lower than that written on their site. I stayed there for 7 nights and must say that their rooms are much larger than the average hotel in Hong Kong. There is a bigger than average mini bar area, wardrobe, TV, 2 night stands and a coffee table in the room.What everyone else said here is true, the beds are hard but not entirely that uncomfortable. The staff are OK but do not provide you with additional information if you do not ask. Perhaps it's the culture but I'm not sure. You can basically take any tram from the city to the hotel except those heading towards Western Road Markets which terminates about 20 minute walk from the hotel. Only a $2 ride which you can pay by coins or by Octopus.Overall, the location was a little off but the convenient public transport makes up for it.

<Content>an oasis This was a really good find. Quite a gem owing to the location. Found awesome package on rates-to-go website. Upon check-in we (my husband and I) were immediately upgraded to a delux room. The rooms are spotless!! We esspecially enjoyed the good shower it provided. The only downside was the hard beds (VERY HARD BEDS) and that the hotel is quite a distance from the MTR and major tourist locations. One can however use the bus or taxi to get around.

<Content>A bit of luxury - loved it! This is a lovely hotel - I've stayed here a few times and it's always been great. The rooms are really big and the last one I was in (on the fifth floor) was very luxurious and elegant.Location is good and I took the tram to Wanchai for a quick breakfast at McDonald's on Hennessy Road. In the evenings, I usually left the hotel, turned left and wandered along Des Voeux Road. There are a few small restaurants and I went to one which was just past Amy's Kitchen. Everything's in Chinese but the meals are really good and very reasonable. Just wander in and have a look at what other people are eating. If you see anything you fancy, point to it. The owners are great and make you very welcome. They do really good hot soybean milk with ginger. Really lovely. I've learnt some Chinese so I can point to it on the menu - I don't know how to say it in Cantonese, though. Any suggestions?Try the Spa at the Ramada - I went for a massage and it was great. Worked out at about 拢20. Felt really relaxed and when I went for a walk later, was not at all fazed by the Hong Kong traffic thundering past.Overall, I love the Ramada. See you there!

<Content>Excellent accommodation in a genuinely interesting location This hotel was a pleasant surprise, smart and comfortable rooms with separate lounge areas, and views of the water between the opposite buildings.As this was a holiday trip the location was interesting and much more of a 'Chinese' experience than staying in more touristy areas would have been. Really enjoyed riding on the trams which stop right outside the door every few minutes, were very cheap and could not have been easier to get around on. The restaurant and bar were okay, but this is Hong Kong, who wants to spend every evening in their hotel !

<Content>Average hotel and location but people made it very pleasant to stay The location is a bit far off the city center and MTR station, eventhough it is still on the renowned Des Voeux Road. However, we didn't find it difficult at all to hail a cab. IFC Mall is about 10 minutes ride. The head concierge gladly helped us to find the exact location of places we wanted to go to, even made phone calls to find out opening hours etc then wrote down the addresses in chinese for the taxi driver. There are couple convinience stores and a Guardian drugstore on the same block, but I highly recommend buying fresh fruits/drinksat the small stall next door. (From the lobby turn to the left). Very reasonably priced and the old man was very kind to us eventhough it was freezing cold at night. Overall it was a good stay, had a good time in Hong Kong. Pleasant weather at daytime and lots of sales too :)

<Content>Not a Four Star!! We stayed four days here.Facilities are non existant. Breakfast and dining are very poor. Room was basic, bed was like a board. Shower was broken. No heating although after many complaints a small heater was provided but was removed after 24 hrs?! MTV Bar was very bare with only enough room for approx 20 people. When you paid for the drinks the barmaid had to take the money down 3 flights in the lift to the cashier at reception who would then send back any change, very bizzare!! View from room was out over local slums. Hotel a good ten minute tram ride from shops or MTR. Would not recommend this hotel if it was the last one in Hong Kong!! Official rating 4 star but we,ve stayed in 4 star in Hong Kong that were much, much nicer than this.

<Content>Just a tram ride away! I鈥檝e stayed at this hotel a few times. The location is a little off the beaten path, however the Tram rides to Central/Happy Valley/Causeway Bay are a nice way to start the day. The rooms have always been very spacious by Hong Kong standards, as well as clean and functional. The rooms higher up facing the harbor have the best views over the harbor 鈥?as facing the buildings at the back of the hotel is not so spectacular. The hotel is not so far from the Macau Ferry Terminal for a day trip, and it is close to lots of nice small restaurants serving tasty local style dishes. The streets around the Ramada are also interesting to browse with their variety of dried sea-foods and other traditional medicine products - some controversial.Wireless internet is available, but not free.

<Content>Great value Definitely good value if you're looking to stay on the Hong Kong Island side. I have stayed here more than 5 times in the last 6 months, and have almost always been upgraded to a suite.The only downside is there is no MTR station within easy reach - Sheung Wan station is a 20-25min walk away. The shuttle bus mitigates this to a large extent, but does not run on weekends or at night. It is also in an older part of town.Book on wotif.com for the best deal!

<Content>Wonderful base to explore Hong Kong My parents are originally from Hong Kong so this trip for me was not the typical vacation (I spent most summers as a child staying with my uncles in Hong Kong and am quite familiar with the city).I loved this hotel because it's located in a very authentic part of Hong Kong...not the glitzy high rises of TST or Central, rather it reminded me of my uncles' old places. There were so many practical amenities around the hotel...breakfast places for 40HK for two; bakeries; laundry stalls. I loved the atmosphere and got to practice my Cantonese, but if you're not comfortable in non-Western settings then I wouldn't recommend it.The hotel itself was a fairly standard-issue chain hotel, though the rooms were nicer / larger than I expected. Because our room wasn't ready when we arrived we were upgraded to a suite...palatial by Hong Kong standards. It was a real steal for us since we booked the rooms for just $100USD per night and we ended up with a 300+ sq foot suite with a separate dining / seating area. It wasn't fancy but was a very comfortable home base for a week's trip. The only disappointment was the gym...really only a tiny, hot, dank room with a flimsy bike and treadmill.Bottom line is if you're comfortable staying a little outside the busiest areas and want to experience the real Hong Kong and get a great deal on a room...then the Ramada is it.

<Content>Best value on Hong Kong Island If you were a very picky person who insisted on five star comforts and treatment then go stay at a 5 star hotel because this is not for you. But if you want a VERY good value hotel on Hong Kong Island, that is comfortable and well positioned then this is the place for you. It is definitely 3.5 or 4 star. It is about a 15 minute trip by tram into Central HK or faster by taxi. There is not much to see around the area where it is positioned but the fact that it is cheap (by HK standards) and located on the Island makes this hotel one of the best value in Asia. It is true the beds are firm, but this wouldnt bother anyone who planned to stay there less than a week or two. Highly recommended - I always get free upgrades when I go.

<Content>Great Was a great place to stay. Checked out other travellers reviews, and found that although the Ramada was quite a way out of the CBD it was an excellent loaction for us - $2HKD ride on the tram to the front of the hotel from the HK train station. We stayed 2 nights and were upgraded to a suite, which had excellent views. Breakfast wasn't very exciting, but we didn't go hungry. A great choice for us.

<Content>Staff with attitude We booked this hotel months ago for a three night stay on our way home from New Zealand. As we would be arriving at 6am I called the hotel and asked if it would be possible to book a day room so we could check in straight away, they informed me that they dont offer day rooms but suggested that I book for the night before that way my room would be ready on arrival. I did this and got email confirmation. At this time I also checked that they could accomodate the 4 of us (2 adults  2 children) in the room as their website allowed me to book this but wanted to double check, they stated no problem with that.On arrival we were met by staff with attitude at the front desk, there were three staff on duty and they were just chatting amongst themself and kept us waiting for quite some time before dealing with our booking. They then just announced that we hadn't bothered to show up the night before so they would be charging us for missing a night, we explained that we had been told to do this so we could guarantee a room. We were told sorry no rooms come back at 3pm! When pushed they said that they could get a room ready for 9am but they did not have room for 2 children and 2 adults in the room, but as a favour to us they would upgrade us to a suite with a waterview and the children could share a bed! By this time we just needed to sleep so registered our disapointment and got sent to the cafe to wait.After going back to the desk several times we finally got our room just before 10am.We cant fault the room in any way, it was beautifully clean and well equiped with towels and toiletries. The bed as everybody else has stated is rock hard but we slept well.Breakfast is good and the staff in the breakfast room are very friendly and helpful. The food the kept well stocked even on the Sunday which was very busy.The chinese resturant in the hotel will not allow you to charge food to your room despite information in the room pack to say you can. The staff weren't the most pleasent we came across but we got a meal which was pretty good.The hotel's location is fine, its just a tram journey into town and the tram stops just outside the hotel. Taxi are very cheap if you need to get somewhere quicker.Its a shame that bad mannered checkin staff let the whole hotel down. We would not stay again for this reason alone.

<Content>Pleasant Stay My Wife and I stayed here for 4 nights. We chose this hotel as it had good reviews and price was quite reasonable. First impressions on arrival were good. Room checkin was prompt and no issues. We booked a standard room and they met our requests too. We got a room on a high floor, non smoking room and double bed. Bathroom was tidy and clean had a show cubicle, large mirror and a chair to sit. There is a lounge area within the room with a coache and TV. All rooms have safes. The room was on the 22nd floor and we had a good view of the Harbour. Didnt eat at the hotel as the reviews were not good, however there plenty of eating places just outside of the hotel. The bed was ROCK HARD, we knew this as some reviewers wrote this. In the evenings it can get a litte cold, however there is no heating facility in the room so we got some extra bedding from house keeping. The hotel is about 25 min from downtown hong kong by tram. Nearest underground station is Sheung Wan 15 min walk. Hong Kong Station is similar distance. There is a shuttle service which the hotel provide to Pickup and drop off between the hotel and Hong Kong Station (7am - 5 pm Mon-Sat.). The only downside is the rooms looks a little old, could do with some modern deco.

<Content>Very positive experience Great hotel, staff were very friendly, we were upgraded to a suite. Bathroom was large, room very clean, bed hard but comfortable. Overall a very pleasant stay. Would certainly recommend. 10 mins on tram to Central or a very cheap cab ride almost anywhere.

<Content>Terrible Hotel We were booked in to stay 8 nights at the Ramada HK, upon checking in we found the desk staff rude and indifferent, they didn't welcome us or ask how we were etc, we actually had to wait a few minutes at the desk to check in as 3 of the staff we're just standing there talking amongst themselves. When we did finally get served they asked us for our passports and credit card, took an imprint of the card and thats it, no thank you, no enjoy your stay nothing!The room itself was quite spacious for HK standards but obviously dated, the bathoom was ok except for the shower, not sure what they were thinking when they installed these tiny capsule showers, there is more then enough room for a regular shower in the bathroom? Now these things I could of probably tolerated, however the beds are absolutely shocking, they aren't firm they are ROCK hard, I don't mind a firm bed but sleeping on these beds was like sleeping on a plank of wood, we both woke up with a sore back and neck in the morning, we woke up at 5am as the beds were just so very uncomfortable.Breakfast was included with our accommodation, we went down at 7am, again it was just more disappointment, the pancakes were like the beds ROCK hard, food wasn't refreshed often enough for the amount of people there and the quality of food on offer was absymal.I Knew the hotel was in a inconvenient location when I booked the hotel, however I didn't realise just how run down the area is where the hotel is located, nothing at all to see in the area and not too sure how safe it would be at night? Needless to say we cancelled the remainder of our stay and moved to the Eaton Hotel in Kowloon which only cost a fraction more and was an excellent hotel.

<Content>fair deal Nice size room for hong kong,sitting room is good idea,shower recess was different but had no problem (very large people may have trouble).room was cleaned to a good standard bed was a little hard but is the norm this part of world.Location is a little out of the way,but tram at door to underground10 mins away.breakfast was fine normal hotel buffet style could be improved with chef cooking eggs as ordered.try the tea house for dinner good food just around corner.tv channels limited and movie channel would be nice.not in tourist area but if your happy to travel that 10 mins is a good hotel to stay in.front desk staff and breakfast staff frindly and helpful.I enjoyed my stay at this hotel.

<Content>Not the best, but hey ho, you live and learn. The hotel staff were ok, there was no language problem as the staff spoke and understood English. The room was small and smelt of smoke, we had requested a non smoking room, had to wait til the following day to be moved. Bathroom was basic nothing special but clean. Beds were seriously hard, made it difficult to get a good nights sleep. Went into Chinese restaurant, found staff rude and kept us waiting, after waiting to order we were restricted to one page of menu, so left. We then went to the lower english style restaurant, which was basic cafe style food but edible. Place miles from city center, not a lot to see in HK, shopping is ok if you are a size 0. Only nice places are Stanley and The Peak. Would not go back unless someone gave me a free ticket. Better hotels and night life in Kowloon.

<Content>Perfect place to stay This hotel is just what you need. Clean, safe, great price and ideal location. Service was timely and professional. The concierge helpedus with all types of tips and directions all over the city. He would go that extra mile to help us out without even thinking about it. The room and bathroom were spotless and up to date.  The room had enough space for three grown men to share without being on top of one another. Outside noise was no issue within the room and the floors were silent. Close to the ferries and trolley service. There is a express bus to and from the airport within a 1 minute walk from the hotel.  If you don't stay shame on you cause you do get the best service with the best the price in town.

<Content>Disappointment Having read a lot of the reviews I went ahead and made my booking. When we turned up the reception staff were very friendly and polite. However having gone to our room our cot was not ready and a lady turned up an hour later with a cot but did not know how to put it together so my husband and I had a go at assembling it. Eventually a manager was called to help assemble the cot. The curtains were broken so we could not open them. The bathroom was extremely dirty, there was black mould in the sink. During the night we could hear people banging on each others doors and slamming doors. We could also hear people walking around upstairs, Never again!

<Content>I enjoyed my stay I stayed at the Remada for 2 weeks and I was very happy with my stay. Firstly I was upgraded to a suite for no extra cost. The room was spaceous and clean. The bathroom was nice and clean, but with the smallest shower I have seen in a while. However the water was hot and plentiful.The bed was very hard but I got used to that. All linen and pillows were nice.The room had tea and coffee making facilities and I got fresh supplies every day.One problem I have on several occasions was that the maid came knocking on my door at 9 am, wanting to make up the room. As I was not checking out I thought this was way too early, and on 2 ocasions I got woken up.The airconditioning in the room worked a real treat and is necessary after the heat outside.I loved the location of the hotel because it was in a less touristy part of town, but the local trams stopped right outside the hotel, and the train and ferries were within walking distance.All staff were friendly.I would stay here again.

<Content>Budget Hotel Not up to Western standards for a Ramada, but mostly for the bathroom. Plastic stall showers leak and completely flood the bathroom floor everytime you take a shower. Pillows are paper thin and housekeeping could only provide 3 extra pillows for the 4 of us. Location is entirely in Chinese neighborhood, but transportation outside the hotel is excellent (wave a taxi, jump on a double decker bus, or take the free hotel shuttle to shopping or ferry terminal). Fresh fruit provided first day, and we picked up more fruit at a small market right outside the door. No movie channels on TV (HBO), but BBC and a few Australian stations available. This hotel is an absolute steal at about $540/night where most other non-luxury hotels are at least TRIPLE the cost. Down side is no swimming pool, which, apparently, many hotels in Hong Kong have. Concierge confirmed flights for us, provided good suggestions for hikes, etc. Rooms smell like smoke, as do all your clothes when you get home.

<Content>Lovely place but too many tour groups My stay at Ramada Hong Kong was fantastic. I had problems during reservation, but the Manager, Ms Ruby Liu immediately corrected it and even went out of her way to make my stay a happy one. Food at both restaurants, are not really good. but there're plenty of good restaurants closed by. One is Amy's Kitchen, which is located to the left side of the hotel' entrance (same road) serves excellent steak, lamb chop. A local bakery for pastries, cookies also located on same row.Transportation is very convenient. To/fro Airport bus No A12 from HKIA stops right across to the hotel, and service is every 15 minutes. Tramps for HK$2 stops right in front of the hotel and local buses too. Taxis are so cheap...of course compared to where I live (Tokyo)...The hotel has an esthetic salon, computer terminals (could be busy due to tour groups, and no privacy). The tour group guests could be a bit annoying in the Lobby or at Breakfast Hall. The staff were polite and helpful, but lack of town knowledge. I had to wait for the concierge clerk who comes is only at certain hours of the day. And he is very efficient and knowledgeable.

<Content>Overall very good Stayed here as part of a family holiday to HK in April (Easter) 2007.Dead easy and cheap to get to via the airport bus. Check-in was prompt and efficient and rooms were well-sized and very clean. I slept well each night. No problems at all really.The in-house cafe sells European-style food (e.g. chicken in a sweet-chilli sauce with chips). The quality is OK, but its quite expensive. OK for a quick bite if arriving on a late flight though.We didn't try the hotel restaurant.Lots of interesting little restaurants in the surrounding streets - all quite cheap. There is a Cafe de Coral (chain restaurant - very good value) about 10 mins walk away and also a McDonalds. Numerous little supermarkets to buy phone cards, mineral water, crisps etc.The local area is really interesting - lots of dried seafood shops. Tram into town stops right out front of the hotel and costs only HK$2 for the 10min ride.Overall a great experience and we are already planning to go back to HK and stay in this hotel next year!

<Content>Slightly differnt locale but perfectly adequate One night stay in January. Hotel staff very friendly and efficient. Checking in was quick. Staff spoke English well. Room was a little cramped like most HK budget hotels. The shower was too small for me. Felt like it was a plastic clam shell. It is a closer ride to Central compared to the other hotels in Causeway Bay. A good place for a couple nights stay if you are not expecting 5 star accommodation!

<Content>Excellent large rooms! Excellent polite staff. Allowed us to check in early and upgraded us to top floor suites for no extra charge. The rooms were large with fantastic views. The only down side was that the beds were very hard, but apparently this is normal in Hong Kong. We loved the area as it felt very safe and we were never hassled by anyone. The trams are excellent as they stop right outside but get very crowded in the rush hour. The octopus cards are great as you can use them on all public transport without the hassle of finding change or explaining where you want to go. Also you can cash in any unused credit at the end of your holiday. Also very useful was the check in desk for Cathay Pacific at Hong Kong central station. This meant we could check in our baggage and tour the city unhindered. The only catch was that you had to buy a ticket for the airport express to gain access to the check in desks.Hong Kong is certainly a fantastic experience!

<Content>A families HK review We stayed at the Ramada for 12 nights, having two rooms for our family of five. From the airport we took a designated luxury hotel to hotel coach, which we booked once we had got off the plane. Guides showed us where to wait and then directed us onto the right coach it took about 35 minutes and we paid 拢42 return for the 5 of us. On our return the consiege phoned through our request for pick-up and we were the only ones on it!!!The rooms were spacious, clean and even had sea views. The staff were really helpful and we would definitely recommend this hotel to others.  As already stated by another user, across the road was a 24hr 'circle K', and just 2 minutes down from it towards Kennedy town was a great laundarette, (The Great China Laundry Shop) very cheap and in that heat/humidity very welcome.We took the tram each day into central and then depending on where we went, either the MTR, buses or Star Ferry. With regard to the Star Ferry after inquiring how much extra it was to ride on the top deck, we felt the extra 3p was well worth it!!!!! especially with Starbucks coffee and an unmissable wafflle shop to tempt you whilst waiting. R66 the revolving restaurant at the Hopewell Centre, Wan Chai was great the afternoon tea buffet was only HK$80 a head. The local markets nearby were very reasonably priced also.The 'Fa Yuen Street Market' in Mongkok was good value and seemed to be where the local bargain hunters shopped. We purchased a museum pass for HK$30 each which covered about 9 museums and lasted for 7 days, great to escape the heat and/or rain!!Taking the mid-level escalators on Hong Kong Island, near Jubilee Street was fun especially as we found Subway and Krispy-Kreme.If you want some good views of the city for free, 2 IFC and Bank of China both have viewing galleries, just take some photo ID.Swimming in the outdoor pools at Victoria Park was a favourite and cost no more than HK$19 (adult) each for 3 hour sessions.Hong Kong park was a real bonus, stop at 'Olivers sandwich bar' in the basement of Citibank Plaza, which you have to walk through for a cheap picnic.Kowloon Park especially on Sunday between 2.30pm and 4pm at Kung Fu corner was entertaining, and just to people watch.Afternoon tea at the Peninsular especially if you are a James Bond fan, was expensive HK$248 but for nostalgia and sheer indulgence a must.Overall the transportation was excellent, cheap and easy to get around. At no time did we feel unsafe whilst walking around late at night, in fact locals were helpful and polite.These were some of our highlights not withstanding the obvious the Peak, Disneyland, Ocean Park and Nyong Ping, which are still all worth a visit.For free internet access use McCafe and Pacific Coffee Company.

<Content>A little bit away but value for money We stayed at the Ramada Hong Kong in February 2007 for 3 nights during chinese new year. We paid about 45鈧?per night per room and this is a good price for a city like hong kong during the new year period. we stayed on a non-smoking floor and had a great view at the harbour from our room.The hotel is located in a very local/chinese but safe part of hong kong island. The location isn't a problem because the nice (and cheap) 1920s trams depart right in the front of the hotel every 2-3 minutes and bring you in the centre of hongkong in about 10 minutes.Staff is friendly and the rooms are big and very clean (cleaned daily). the rooms had tv (some english spoken channels), a mini-bar and a safe. the furniture is not the coolest, but who cares when you just in the hotel for sleeping and taking a shower (bathroom is also clean and not too small).you can have breakfast-buffet in the hotel which is not bad (chinese dim sum and continental style) for the price you have to pay. close to the hotel are various very cheap chinese food stalls where you can taste the real hong kong.i would definetly stay there again.

<Content>good hotel april 2007. with friend.great hotel : cheap in price compared to other. we booked a standard double bed , was upgraded to the highest floor.altho not view of harbour bec all rooms were taken. the room is very clean. standing shower small but nice. room has pantry, tea, coffee, water for guest. tv are cable tv. 4 pillows for use, slippers, all bath items are given for use.good location if you will not take the mtr often. easy transportation. 5 minutes to macau ferry terminal. bus, trams, taxi are available outside the hotel.altho this hotel is located in the old hong kong, a few minutes ride to causeway, kowloon, ocean park, the peak are within reach, more convenient and more sightseeing while riding. i just rode the mtr once (from nathan road kowloon to central. )the area near the hotel are all shops selling birds nest and chinese delicasies.octopus card is recommended if you wouldnt like to bring coins because buses, trams dont give change.BUT you'll be collected a hk$7 fee for returning the card at the end of your stay at any mtr or airport station. restaurants: in big chinese restaurants, ask first if you'll pay for the peanuts or tea. we ate at the chinese rest beside this hotel, we were given peanuts and tea upon sitting down, we thought its free but were charged ! two waiters are quite rude. you will not be served water. you have to pay for it. !in my next trip to hkg, i will go back to this hotel. unless you want to stay in hotels that are just besides shopping area like nathan, canton road, causeway, then this hotel is good considered the price.

<Content>Good value for money We stayed at the Ramada Hotel on Hong Kong Island for 5 nights in March 2007. We stayed in room 2511 (on the 25th floor) which was large, clean and comfortable. There was a double bed in the bedroom area and a safe in the wardrobe. Next to this was a small lounge area with a TV. This led into the entrance hallway where there were tea/coffee making facilities and a mini bar. There were plenty of cupboards, drawers and storage space in all three areas. The bathroom had a shower rather than a bath but was roomy enough and was equipped with a hairdryer. As we were on the 25th floor we had breathtaking views with regards to the height but there were very high blocks of flats in front breaking our view of the sea. The hotel staff were helpful and polite. Breakfasts were fine with a reasonable choice and not too expensive. There was a bar on the 5th floor but it did not have much of a selection of drinks. On the ground floor was a restaurant. The food was good but over priced and we did not find the staff particularly accommodating. There was a small gym next to the breakfast room but it was not particularly well equipped. I believe the hotel also has a Spa but we did not give it a try. The hotel is not on a Hong Kong MTR line but it is on a tram line with a very good service to Central. The trams were great fun to ride on. As the hotel was slightly out of the centre it was very reasonably priced and overall I would say that it鈥檚 a good place to stay and I would certainly stay there again if I were in Hong Kong. While there, get yourself an Octopus card which allows you to travel on virtually every method of transport in Hong Kong and very useful and easy to use. These can be bought from Central MTR Station

<Content>Questionable Value I travel all over the world and have stayed in everything from 5-star luxury hotels to places in China that don't even take credit cards. I think this makes me a fairly good judge of value as opposed to just price. In the case of the Ramada Hong Kong, the value is a big question mark. The rooms were clean enough, but their beds are, perhaps, the most uncomfortable I've encountered in my travels through Asia. They offer wireless internet in the rooms, but it is pricey and can only be purchased at the front desk. In terms of location, the hotel is in the older section of Hong Kong, and virtually every business is Chinese. For a Westerner staying at this hotel, don't expect to find any western-style restaurants, bars, or entertainment in the neighborhood or within any reasonable walking distance. And, be cautious about their free drink coupon provided at check-in. It's only good for non-alcoholic drinks and a small one at that.Would I stay here again? No. I'll pay more for a better hotel.

<Content>Not thrilled with location I had a nice 5 night stay at this hotel. It was clean and the rooms were much larger than many of the hotels my friends were staying in. I had to change from a smoking room to a non smoking room. I could barely breathe when I got off the elevator for my first room. They didn't have any rooms for that night but could change me the next day. I insisted and finally they gave me a nicer room on the top floor that didn't smell like smoke and swithched me to a non smoking room the next day. The staff was very friendly but it did take some convincing to get me in a non smoking room the first night. I never found any restaurants around the restaurant to eat in. The hotel does have a breakfast buffet and they give you a discount if you purchase it the night before. I never tried it. I also found it easier to get the front desk to write on a card in chinese where I wanted to go to give to the taxi drivers. I never had to wait more than 5 mintues if that for a cab. I kept the hotel address card in my purse to show to the taxi cab driver when I caught a cab going back to the hotel. I only had 1 driver who spoke english. I would also suggest picking up an Octopus card at the airport. They can be used for the ferry,trains and the buses. It came in very handy. The nice thing is we didn't have the tailor's shoving business cards in our hands everytime we turned around like the Kowloon area. We didn'thave a great view of the harbor but my friend was on the 27th floor and had an incredible view. The beds are rock hard in almost all of the Hong Kong area. All my friends complained and they paid a lot more than I did for their rooms. I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Super tram rides I agree with all the other reviews - don`t bother with the (franchised out ) restaurant. Your bill will be in Chinese print and they don`t serve coffee. Hotel room  service excellent -even to the free slippers. However the fish smell wafts around the street and the hotel`s aircon only cools. We had amazing value breakfasts at Amy`s (Left out of hotel) and at Dear`s (Right out of hotel). Also a good evening meals at Canada restaurant ( left out of hotel - top of Hill Street). Had a couple of glasses of wine one evening in the hotel`s bar and it cost almost as much as our meal.We walked a lot in HK (and this area is not situated in the high class shopping zone) and caught the tram back Also walked into town to the cable car station (not that easy to find), went up to the top and walked back to town via the sloping footpaths leading down to the botanical gardens. Mind you that was a long walk but interesting as along the footpaths some of the trees were labelled and also had some info on the rainforested(!) slopes of Victoria Peak. This Hotel is excellent value in the `real Hong Kong`

<Content>Good hotel bad location Ramada hotel was very good value for money, new, good rooms, friendly staff, BUT the location was very bad, far away from everything though you can take a tram for 2 HKD that leaves you in the door of the hotel. We chose this hotel because it is good and unexpensive, the distance wasn`t a real problem for us.

<Content>Good Hotel For the low price this was a nice hotel. The room was clean, the staff was helpful. Although the location is not the best it is directly across the street from the trolley; which makes it very convienant. The room was portioned into two areas; like a suit, only much smaller. It made the room feel smaller than it really was. It also didn't allow us to watch TV from bed; something we love to do on vacation. The shower was great, but there was no tub. Also no pool. Our only othe complaint was street noise. You could here the rumble of traffic all night long. For the price, a good choice.

<Content>Average Hotel, in an average location Stayed here for a week in the beginning of January. Room sizes are small and the hotel is located close to Western Police station. Overall this is a budget hotel which has very hard beds in a very 'local' location.

<Content>See the real Hong Kong Just returned from a thoroughly enjoyable stay at the Ramada Hong Kong. Very pleasant hotel. Room was more like a suite with a view over the harbour. Breakfast was about 拢4 extra each but well worth it. Tram and bus stops right outside. Plenty of restaurants full of locals within 2/3 minutes. At only 拢38 a night per room it was a real bargain..

<Content>An absolute gem of a hotel.... We had 5 nights in Hong Kong as part of a 7 month round the world trip and opted for the Ramada on HK Island as opposed to staying in Kowloon. I must admit the price was the main reason as it seemed much cheaper than a lot of the other HK hotels, but from the web pictures it looked modern and although the location wasn't quite right we were looking forward to the stay.Check in was tough. There was a trainee working on the desk and her English was non existent, fortunately there was another girl on hand to assist and despite a few teething problems with credit card guarantees we were checked in smoothly and headed to our room.One really nice touch about the hotel was the hotel porter would always push the lift button when he saw you approaching, so in most instances the lifts were ready once you got there. It's these little small things that make a hotel.Anyway to the room. We had read previously about single guests being upgraded to a suite room, which consisted of 3 parts. Firstly the entrance and bathroom area, then a living room type section, followed by the bedroom. We didn't expect to get a room like this as we had only paid for a standard room, so we were very surprised to find we were allocated a suite room. It was a magnificent room, very modern and bright with good air conditioning. A real joy to spend 5 nights in there in all honesty.The rest of the hotel is also very nice and modern. A special word also for the concierge, who was very helpful with local information and travel instructions.As for location, well we absolutely loved it. Sure it is away from the main downtown area, and obviously across the river from Kowloon but this felt like real Hong Kong. It was about a 20min walk to the underground station, although countless trams came back and forth and stopped right outside the hotel, all for a cost of 2HKD...about 14p in sterling. We were always greeted with a smile by the locals and loved the views from the top of the trams. It was a little slower in the evenings to get around, but if you haven't got to rush anywhere then it is the best way to get around. Taxis were very cheap also.As I said the walk to the first stop on the underground is about 20mins, but it is down the dried fish road which in itself is a tourist attraction, if a little smelly.One final thing that really helped us is the laundry. Don't use the hotel service, instead cross the road directly in front of the hotel and walk left. About a minutes walk is a lovely local laundry where the owners did a huge bag of washing for 16HKD, plus she always gave us 20% discount. Laundry was always ready to pick up before 6pm that evening. Fantastic.All in all I would recommend this hotel to everybody. It's in a great different location with good transport links. As for the room, it was 2nd only to the Novotel HK airport for quality during our whole 7 months trip.

<Content>Promise Not Delivered Stayed at the Ramada Hong Kong in October 2006 for 7 nights. Upon negotiation with the hotel prior to our arrival I was promised the Grand Harbour View Suite ($2,800.00 HK per night). Arrived at 10.00pm with 3 children in tow and was escorted up to my promised room. Once entering the room I was a little suprised to see 3 cot beds placed in the middle of the floor and the main bed was a fold out sofa couch within the same area. When booking I was advised the suite was a 2 bedroom + sitting area apartment. Paying $2,800HK per night I was not happy. After many discussions with the Manager my family was placed in a 1 bedroom + sitting area apartment for a slightly reduced nightly fee. I agree with other travellers comments in relation to breakfast (very average). A cheap option for breakfats is Dim Sum at the restaurant next door or 24 hour shop across the road which sells pastries, orange juice, fruit, etc. Overall the stay was OK.

<Content>Very satisfactory I received a friendly welcome on arrival and was pleased to be told I had been upgraded to a suite on the 29th floor. Excellent views across the harbour. The suite had a very spacious lounge area and a lovely walk-in shower. A good supply of shampoo and a toothbrush and toothpaste was provided too. I had dinner in the Chinese restaurant on the ground floor. At the end of the meal I could not put the meal on my hotel bill as they said the restaurant was not part of the hotel, which seemed rather odd so my meal had to be paid in cash or by credit card. One girl on the front desk spoke very poor English, the other staff spoke better English. The hotel is not very centrally located so one needs to take a tram or taxi down town. Taxis are very cheap.I was stopping over in Hong Kong for 1 night on my way from Australia to England so the hotel was very good for the purpose. If I had a longer stay in Hong Kong I would stay more centrally elsewhere in Hong Kong or on Kowloon Island.

<Content>Mixed Feelings but good overall I stayed here recently for 3 nights.The upgrade was great. Suite was clean, spacious and a harbour view. Great value! Breakfast was quite limited and service was so so .Quite long queues at check in and check out. Seemed to be quite a lot of tour groups from Mainland China. Gym very small.You need to have wireless internet for the rooms to get free broadband , otherwise $hk50 per half hour by reception.Overall, if you get a good rate, it is a nice hotel if you get an upgrade.The only downside for me was the location. It is in quite a local area and not really geared to the traveller. Trams and taxis are very cheap , so definately not a problem. However, not a lot to see if you just want to walk around for a bit. Nearest metro is a taxi or tram ride away. Staff were quite pleasant although english was quite limited by many of the staff.My suite was lovely but soundproofing wasnt too good as I could hear a tv from another room from inside my suite. However, if you get a great deal and dont mind getting a taxi all the time...go for it!!

<Content>Good rooms, excellent service. Poor restaurant Previous reports give details of the well-furnished, smart clean rooms and bathrooms, but slightly out of the way location, which I will concur. We stayed at the Ramada for a week, booking through the hotel鈥檚 own website that has long stay discounted rates. These rates beat the prices quoted in various Internet hotel search engines that are based on daily rates. Try to download and print the hotel name/ address from the Internet before coming, as most drivers do not use English hotel names and we had difficulties with taxis until we showed them the hotel card.The hotel runs a free half hourly bus shuttle service to Airport Express in Central (10minutes away), but you need to ask at the concierge as most guests do not bother to use it, preferring to take the tram that runs every few minutes in front of the hotel. The shuttle bus is useful on the last day, as your luggage cannot be taken on the tram and saves you a taxi fare.If you travel on the Airport Express between Hong Kong and the airport (100HK$ for a single traveller - 70HK$ for more than one traveller) you can check in and deposit you luggage in the city airport counter and then you are free to wander around Hong Kong at leisure with your boarding pass in your pocket. At the airport, just walk through the departure gates.Airport bound buses A10 and A12 (HK$43) have stops almost opposite the hotel, but may be cumbersome if you have heavy luggage.We made a few local phone calls from our two adjoining rooms and to our surprise were not charged for the calls. I also left my luggage in the hotel for 10 days when travelling to China. They stored my suitcase without charge.The hotel restaurant at the ground floor is the smartest in the area and always busy, which normally is a good sign. However we found that the kitchen service was over stretched. At one table a man was shouting, as obviously his orders was not coming. One of our dishes took longer than 45 minutes, arriving after we cancelled it and when it arrived, it was the wrong order. We did not eat it and had problems in getting it taken off our bill. We were charged for the small plates of pickles and snacks brought to our table before the meal, that we had not asked for and thought were complimentary. The restaurant does not have English speaking staff or English menus. There are no toilets in the restaurant and customers have to cross the hotel lobby to use the hotel鈥檚 toilets.

<Content>Wonderful value for money Just got back from HK. Ramada's room was a delight for the price ( 100 USD/nite). Clean, tastefully decorated,  has plenty of little shelves for storage. The hotel is in the far west end of HK Island (very old part of town but offers some delightful places to eat with the locals) but still convenient enough to get to Central by tram or taxi. The gym being a joke aside, I was most impressed with the overall quality I got from this hotel. Will definitely recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Ramada a great surprise I must qualify my five stars by saying that for the price it deserves five stars, but is not a five star location. However, the service was top of the line and everyone that we interacted with was incredibly eager to help. We were also upgraded to a suite and our room cost 470HK$ on wotif. I was pleasantly surprised by the entrance and welcome counter of the hotel and the room was much larger than I expected. It had a seperate sitting area with a divider from the sleeping area. The bed that we had was incredibly firm, which was fine for me, but the girlfriend did not love it.The location is right near the dry seafood district, but is an easy bus ride into the central district. Or you could walk and see the wares for sale. When it is hot and humid, it is a pretty long walk.We tried the breakfast buffett and it was average, but not a bad way to start out the day. We would have better later in the trip, but I've also had worse since.Overall the facilities were clean, nice and the employees were very helpful. I recommend this hotel if you are going to HK and don't want to blow your budget on where you sleep.

<Content>Upgraded to a suite! This hotel's in the western district of Hong Kong which doesn't have a lot going on in terms of shopping or eating, but it's not far from the central part which does. To get there, you can either walk (maybe twenty minutes), or get the tram which takes about 10 minutes. Trams stop right outside the hotel and there's one about every minute or so. Although the tram probably isn't the fastest method of transport, it's quite good fun and costs only HK$2 for any distance - and it runs all the way from the Ramada down to the Causeway Bay area, going right through the central parts of Hong Kong island. So it's definitely the cheapest way to get about. A taxi from Central Station will cost about HK$25-30The hotel's quite a glitzy affair with a marble lobby and muzac in the corridors. We paid HK$880 for a standard room, but were automatically upgraded to a suite for our stay of three nights, which is a major reason I'm recommending this hotel! I booked through wotif.com and although it said an upgrade would be provided, I didn't actually expect one. Another tip for booking - during the week the price can slump to HK$470 a night, but it's very pricey during the weekends and gets up to around HK$1300. Having watched the prices on the above mentioned websites, usually the price is only as low as 470 when you book during the week you're going to be staying. Room was great beacuse of the size - though admittedly I didn't see the standard room. The suite has a screen divider that separates the bedroom area from the sitting room part, which has a small table and chairs, a big TV, sofa and then the bathroom's great - marble and a powerful shower. Internet : you can buy cards at the desk for $40 which gives you up to three hours surfing. But you have to use the time in one session - you can't log out and come back to use another hour at a later date. There are aslo 12 hour and 24 hours cards available. We connected wirelessly, but I'm pretty sure you can borrow a cable from the front desk if you need to plug in.Restaurant : we didn't use it. There's a breakfast available, and you can buy a voucher for breakfast with a 25% discount at the reception desk. I can't quite remember how much it was - maybe about HK$50 each. From what I've read on here, the breakfast wasn't great. There's a few little bakeries around the hotel. Overall : a good hotel for the price. The size of the rooms really makes the hotel standout. The only thing that could be better is location - but it never prevented us from doing anything. Riding the tram for ten minutes is not exactly a hardship.

<Content>Nice surprise The booking was in order on arriving at 0700, we had expected to not be allowed to check in so early, but it posed as no problem for the hotel and they upgraded us to a suite. The hotel only has a few non smoking floors. There is internet facility, not cheap but convenient for emergencies, located to the left up the stairs when facing reception.The suite was large, a good size bathroom, sitting area and the bedroom that closed off with sliding doors. The shower was a step in phone booth type shape - might pose as difficulty for some. Was advertised as a harbour view room but being a block back from the harbour the view is not uninterrupted. The location of the hotel was our drawcard, very convenient using the trams  subway to get around - and cheap. The hotel offers a shuttle to the main station but it is not too frequent and the trams are always passing the hotel. We found the cheapest way to the aiprort was using the Citybus A12 which departs opposite the hotel - just like the private shuttle with space for the luggage and double decker. Took about 35 minutes.

<Content>Absolutely fine - great base in Hong Kong We stayed at the Ramada for a week this Ocotober. The hotel is absolutely fine, and is a great base from which to expore Hong Kong. The tram stops right outside the hotel, and for $2 (about 15p) it takes you to the centre of Hong Kong in about 10 mins. You can also use it to go to lots of other places too.The hotel itself was really good value for the amount we paid for it, and is great if you are looking for somewhere safe and reliable. The rooms are nice, bathrooms great, and I really would recommed it to anyone. I would certainly stay here again.The staff are helpful, but Engish is certainly not their first language! But that wasn't a problem at all. The hotel is not in an area full of tourists, but like most places in Hong Kong it feels safe and public tranport from the hotel is brilliant.

<Content>Fabulous hotel My husband and I stayed here for just over a week. We arrived way before check-in but our room was already waiting for us. And what a wonderful room. Very clean, spacious, lovely bathroom (shower better than ours at home), loads of storage space. The hotel is very conveniently located right on the tram line (which incidently takes payment by Octupus Card, there's no need to have a pocket full of 2 dollar bits). Some may say that the hotel is abit out of way but because of the excellent public transport system in HK, it doesn't feel like it is. I would very highly recommend this hotel to others. We would expect to pay a lot more than we did for this standard of hotel. Excellent choice. Will definately stay here again the next time we visit HK (which hopefully we will as HK is a blast!)

<Content>Decent overnight choice in Hong Kong We overnighted here on the night of August 5th, just at the tailend of the typhoon that paralysed the HK airport. Our Cathay flight was delayed 4 hours and we arrived at the hotel at 00:30, just after midnight. To our surprise there were still some other guests checking in, probably got delayed on the way in too. We were upgraded to their suite as it seems to be the policy for any singles or couples who did not require 2 beds since there appears to be more of these suites than regular twin bedded rooms. Everything about these rooms were said in the other reviews so I will not go into details here, just the typical deluxe room with the divided living room and bedroom, and you cannot see the TV from your bed, a major pet peeve of many but we did not make use of the TV since we went straight to the shower and bed.Room: The room is very well finished and spotlessly clean, we were assigned on the 27th floor, at first we thought it was a smoking floor since only 15 and 25 were marked with a non-smoking sign on the elevator, but the room's door had a non-smoking sign on it and we did not smell any smoke so it was all good. The double bed was very hard, like most Asian hotels, but we were too exhausted to care after a 13 hour flight and a12 hour layover at Vancouver.Washroom: The toilet only flush when you hold the button all the way down for the entire duration of the flush, very annoying and thankfully we're only staying overnight. The shower stall is also extremely tight and small for anyone over 5'9 (I'm 6'0). It appears that this hotel serves a largely mainland Chinese demographic so I guess this explains the small size of the shower. Checking out: Since it was a Sunday the shuttle bus to the pier did not run, bummer. But the bellboy was very nice and helped us load our luggage onto a Taxi he grabbed for us while we were checking out. Funny blooper: The cabbie asked us where to? in Mandarin as he first thought we were from China (most guests at this hotel are as mentioned before), I told him to take us to the Macau ferry pier in Cantonese and he was quite surprised.

<Content>Loved it!!! Stayed at the Ramada July 31-August 4. We often visit family in HKG who live in a building behind the Ramada. Decided to try this hotel since our relative's apartment is small and bathroom situation is not ideal. The hotel's building has been around for the last 8 years at least. It was built to open as a hotel but then construction was halted a few years back. Glad to see it has finally opened as a Ramada.The location is west of central on Hong Kong island. You will be disappointed if you are looking for a touristy area like Tsim Tsa Tsui in Kowloon. This is a working class neighbourhood on Des Voeux Road on the Hong Kong side near the dried seafood market...it is not very tourist friendly. Buildings are old and dirty and you won't find many tourists in the area. However, some restaurants in the area will have english menus or staff with limited english. Don't be put off by the rushed service. In HKG everyone works fast as time is money!!! It is very safe and convenient considering the Police Station is located down the block and the tram stop is right outside the hotel doors! The Cityflyer airport bus stops and picks up across the street. You can buy a round trip ticket at the airport which costs around $70HKD. Buses A10/11/12 will stop near the hotel. The MTR (subway) sheung wan station is located a few tram stops away (trams come by every 1-5 minutes and cost $2 for adults) or 15 minutes by foot. This hotel is great if you are looking to stay in clean, comfortable and affordable facilities off the beaten track and you like exploring. If you are travelling around HKG quite a bit and are staying in this area, my suggestion is to get an octopus card. Available at all MTR stations at the customer service counter, you pay a $50HKD deposit for the card and then add as much money as you want. The deposit is refundable with a small service charge. You can add fare at any customer service counter in the subway stations, 7-11/Circle K stores, or add fare machines inside the stations. The electronic swipe cards are useable on trams, buses, MTR subway, mini-buses and the star ferries as well as for purchasing items at 7-11 and Circle K convenient stores. Great if you hate carrying a lot of change. Buses are air-conditioned and depending on the route cost about $3-5 per ride. Don't forget to pick up a map at the airport...the marked yellow areas show places of interest for tourists.We arrived in HKG on Sunday but did not check in to the hotel until Monday afternoon. The hotel offers travel trade staff a special rate of $490HKD (or $70CDN) with a free upgrade to a harbour view suite upon availability. Just present your business card or identification at check in. Also special rates for weekly or long stay guests. These rates aren't available on the Ramada website. The hotel has their individual website which shows all their rates. The hotel didn't have a non-smoking room available until later so we stored our bags with the bellman and came back a couple of hours later to pick up the keys. We stayed in room 1513 on the 15th floor. This Ramada only has two non-smoking floors (15 and 25) so a request should be made while making a reservation. I reserved a non-smoking twin room but we were assigned a non-smoking queen room with a harbour view. After seeing their standard twin room (small regular room with two twin beds) we opted for the upgraded deluxe room with a queen.A beautiful room with a queen bed (actually two singles put together and beds very firm but this is common in asia). Bedroom has a large armoire for hanging clothes and an in-room safe. Writing desk and chair. Sliding door separates bedroom from a large living room/sitting area. Love seat and chair faces long chest of drawers with a television. Additional round table and chairs on the side. Large entryway and tons of storage space everywhere for all your things. We had a partial view of the harbour between all the highrise buildings. Large bathroom had an odd and small capsule-style shower but no tub. The shower had sauna and jet options that didn't work. If you are quite tall or big, this shower may not be very comfortable for you. Lots of counter space for our stuff and a separate vanity table and chair. Room was exceptionally clean but the hotel is also very new. Lobby area was very small. Noticed some western tourists but several chinese tour groups. I was concerned since these groups tend to be noisy and often smoke in the rooms. Also cueing for the frontdesk seems to be unheard of but is also common in asia. Frontdesk service is first come first served or whoever cuts the line first. The fifth floor has a bar, lounge area, and a very small unusable gym. The equipment is very old and we laughed when we saw the tiny bike and treadmill. I think the free weights weighed less than 1lb each. Didn't dine in the hotel since it was so cheap and convenient to eat around the hotel.Great hotel, clean rooms and polite housekeepers in an area that was convenient to us. Frontdesk could use some help with their english and a smile wouldn't hurt either. All in all, would definitely stay here again.
