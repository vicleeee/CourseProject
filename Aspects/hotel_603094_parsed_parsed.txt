<Content>Overall ok Location is ok which you can say about the most of the hotels in the centrum. Theres RLD corner away and a high quality coffeeshop too. You don't have to come across with these two if you don't want to tho. Generally a nice place to visit the dam. Minuses are that rooms are a bit small and atleast my room didn't have any view alltho the hotel itself is located by the canal.

<Content>Warning for disabled travellers The location of the hotel is very good particularly if you are staying one night. The hotel website and direct e-mail to the hotel were VERY misleading for disabled people. The website says that there is a ground floor room near the reception for wheelchair users. This is now a kitchen! Response to my e-mail assured me that wheelchair users are 鈥榳ell catered for鈥?As a wheelchair user with some mobility I would warn anyone wanting to use this hotel that it isn鈥檛 good for wheelchair users. Yes, there is a lift and really that鈥檚 about it. When we reached the 4th floor we had to turn a very tight corner with a large step down into a small corridor. We explained that this would be a problem and were moved to another room, but it really wasn鈥檛 easy to manage- very difficult to manoeuvre the chair. Lovely bathroom but couldn鈥檛 get the chair in!For anyone visiting this hotel note that the carpets are very dirty throughout and the breakfast is certainly not worth the money.

<Content>Cute I booked this after looking through trip advisor for a decent hotel in the dam. The room was incredibly small and had no view other than looking in a void. It was decorated beautifully although the giant Van Gogh wall print does do your head in after a while (sorry Holland) and top quality fixtures/fittings. The bed was very soft which wasnt great if you have a bad back like me. It was a little noisey too as it was situated by the lift and you could hear it going all the time and also the loud closing of doors. Id advise you to go out for breakfast as the hotel does a very basic buffet with no hot food, even the toaster was broken. Service was ok, i didnt find it that friendly considering the money i was paying. This is a nice boutique hotel but at 150 euros a night for basic room its a little overpriced. Modern hotels arent few and far between anymore so you might be able to find a better deal elsewhere

<Content>Boutique Hotel with Flair We chose this hotel based on location and price. It's located in Centrum, on a canal, and within walking distance of all of the things we wanted to see again in Amsterdam. Furthermore, we prefer quirky hotels with personalities to sterile, chain hotels.This hotel definitely has personality. From the red and white downstairs lobby/check-in area/breakfast nook, to the half-flights of stair separating the rooms, to the rooms, some of which have murals recreating famous paintings on the wall. The staff was very friendly, offering us directions, suggestions, making us cappucinos, and even lending us an umbrella one rainy night. The rooms are small by US standards, and average by European standards. The double bed was just two twins pushed together, which tends to be the norm in Europe (unfortunately). The bathroom was quite small, but was designed so cleverly and so well, that it was fun to use. The room and bathroom were immaculate, totally spotless and quite new looking. The included breakfast doesn't have a lot of choices, you may be better off getting something at a nearby cafe.You can also book a room for a half-day (i.e., during a long layover) which is great. You can arrive early in the morning, crash for a few hours, shower, then wander about Amsterdam before your evening flight. We were so pleased with our first day, that we have used The Times Hotel in this fashion several times. We paid around $90 USD for our rooms, which was a great bargain for what we got.

<Content>a quirky little hotel Just back from 3 days in Amsterdam and found the Times Hotel excellent. A 12 minutes walk from Central station. Very well situated. On Herrencracht canal, which is beautiful and very peaceful. Small rooms, comfortable bed, very well appointed bathroom, adequet breakfast (鈧?0) We would certainly go back.A visit at this time of year to Keukenhof and the bulb and flower fields is well wotrhwhile and we also enjoyed a canal dinner cruise.

<Content>Excellent value for money, top location I chose this hotel because the hotel i stayed in on my first night was depressing, the Tulip Inn Dam Square, which had a great location. The Times is only a minute away from the Tulip Inn, i payed cheaper and it was a 1000 times better.The hotel is a tiny Boutique Hotel, the neigborhood is filled with restaurants and there is need to eat at the Hotel. The decor is very trendy, my room was small but very well equiped; flat screen TV. free wireless internet that functions very well, idividualy controlled heater/ac, safe....For the price i payed, this is a very good bargain. i ahve stayed in many of the Amsterdam hotels, including 5 stars, and they were all old and not exciting, this one is fresh, practical and in a very nice area.I will definalty stay there next time in Amsterdam.

<Content>Amazing! I don't understand the negative reviews here. I thought the hotel ticked all the right boxes... excellent location, great friendly staff, reasonably priced and clean. We stayed on the fourth floor with lovely views of the canal. The room was small but all you needed for a weekend break. The shower was clean and nicely designed. I loved the fact that it was set in an old building but that the interior had a modern funky feel - leaving it cosy yet stylish. The old masters wallpaper gave it an added cheeky and fun flavour.We paid 180 euro (approx 拢133) for two nights which I think is a bargain considering the location etc.I don't generally post on this site because I find the reviews none representative (usually a forum for those who want to complain) but I couldn't let those people considering this excellent hotel miss it!

<Content>dirty carpets.. this hotel was ok but i ve stopped in cheaper ,better quality hotels with friendlier staff , the carpets look like someone has shite on there shoes and walked all over the carpets ,the smell of smoke is bad through the day ,but on a night the smoke smells of dope so if you are healthy like me dont go as you find yourself complaining none stop (will be good to get the smoking ban in like they have in england )the food is rubish ,dont bother go and pay at a nice cafe for food.i would go back to amsterdam but only with the smoking ban in place , i dont mind people smoking as long as they do it in there own homes or smoking only places which dont subject non smokers to there filthy habbit.a lot of people who come to amsterdam are horrible dope smokers , and you can spot them a mile of , similar to what glue sniffers looked like out off the eighties-thick as [--]. its a lovely city but spoiled by these people who come here to get stoned (shallow ,shallow people.) what ever happened to seeing the sights , a little culture , have a nice meal and a good drink like a propper bloke.........

<Content>modern hotel We chose this hotel at the airport last minute. We chose it for it's proximity to the train station, canal and the sleek stylish modern decor. Unfortunatly the carpets were ridden with stains and the halls smelled of smoke, and at night the smell was so strong I felt like I was sleeping in an ashtray. Not sure if it came from other rooms or the person working in the lobby with his friends. Another down fall is that it is off a red light street and as a result I found myself walking among drunk, obsence men. It seems like it's a party hotel which is not what i'm interested in. It did provide me with adequate basics, and if it could maintain some cleaniless I would stay again.

<Content>Good location - ignore the staff A lot of people write off this hotel because of the staff. Admittedly if you are looking for service this is not the hotel for you. The staff are quite simply irrelevant - they are not trained hotel staff and have no interest or desire to be helpful. This however should NOT put you off the hotel, which is in an excellent location, is semi-cool boutique, clean, bright and better than your average Amsterdam hotel (all of which suck unless you intend spending a fortune). This hotel is for young travellers! Beware of rooms at he back, you are better off with a canel view... Th couple we stayed with were kept up all night because there room looked over a small internal courtyard where another room was having a party! Despite that I would go there again. Don't pay extra for breakfast!

<Content>Teeny Tiny rooms, but great location My friends and I were at The Times Hotel over the weekend. It is excellently located on a quiet residential street near the train station, flower market, shopping district, etc. Sadly, the location is the hotel's best, if not only attribute. We arrived on a Fri night to find that they booked our reservation in their computer for July, not June. Altho they had a room free for that night, they didnt for the next night. SO THEY WERE GOING TO SEND THEIR NEXT GUEST SOMEWHERE ELSE. We had two rooms on Fri night. One of them was in the attic. DO NOT GET THIS ROOM. it was roughly 300 sq ft, with a pitched roof. two adults could not walk past each other. the other room was on the first floor and was a quad, with two beds on one level and two beds on a loft level. it was more comfortable, altho it lacked anywhere to sit (aside from the bed). both rooms faced the canal (at an extra charge) with lovely views. The second night, all 4 of us crammed into one room, which was ok (but no privacy).Finally, the beds are awful - soft and adorned w polyester sheets. For 200 EUR a night, i expected at least a good night's rest. To the hotel's credit, the front desk crew were nice and accomodating.

<Content>tiny room, great view, weird bathroom, cleanliness was a ??, red light area We were unhappy with our other hotel in Amsterdam, so we saw this while walking around. The guy at the desk showed us a sample room---which was above the area served by the elevators so we wouldn't have wanted it. But, it was spacious and had a luggage rack and chair. When we checked in we were given a tiny room--there was maybe 2 feet clearance on each side of the beds--2 twin beds pushed together. There was NO shower curtain or enclosure, which I have heard of in other hotels. The procedure seemed to be to shower, then use your smaller towel as a bath mat and to mop up the water you got on the floor. Breakfast was separate, and 10 euros each, so we walked out and got pastries or tea. Yes, there WAS air conditioning, which worked well. The white cotton cover on my comforter smelled sour and may not have been that clean. It was not changed during our 3 days there....

<Content>An underwhelming experience We originally booked into the Hotel New Amsterdam (having found it on Tripadvisor) but received an email a few months later apologising that they were being refurbished and explaining that they had moved our booking to the Times Hotel instead.The Hotel is in an excellent location - on one of Amsterdams three main canals - Herengracht. It is within easy walking distance of the grand central station where you can pick up the canal bus and tour the city by water and also within walking distance of various museums. Or you can just meander along the canal and simply enjoy the beautiful architecture. So... location great.The hotel was clearly recently refurbished - a nice clean interior. The reception is very modern - bright red furnishing and white walls. It also houses the breakfast area, which is fairly small and very open plan. So open plan that if, like us, you are seated near the front door, it can get very draughty with people coming and going, and you do feel a bit on display whilst you eat. Breakfast was disappointing - the croissant were clearly a few days old, the choice of bread and jams limited, the choice of cereal also very limited. There was ham and hard boiled eggs but, all in all, had breakfast not been included in our room rate, we would definitely have eaten out at a cafe on the 2nd morning.Our twin room was very small indeed. It had two single beds pushed right next to each other (not enough room to leave a space in between) and a wardrobe. That was all the room could take - the TV was a slimline version mounted on the wall (absolutely no room for it to have been on the floor). You could just about walk around the two beds. It felt even smaller because the facing wall was covered in a massive mural of an enlarged van gogh painting. Very bright and innovative but somewhat overpowering in a tiny room. The bathroom, however, was spotless with a very effective shower. The service was not brilliant - I asked for advice on restaurants and was underwhelmed with the response. When I tried again and asked for the best area to walk to for a selection of restaurants I got a disinterested you will find restaurants anywhere type of response. So, it was clean and well finished and the location was great. But I would definitely try somewhere else if I return to Amsterdam because for the price we had a very average hotel experience.

<Content>Unacceptable service the rooms are nicely done (new renovation), but that's about it:- service people at hotel are completely unknowledgeable, they must be students who have not been properly trained - this is where the hotel has a real problem. they don't know how to print a proper bill, etc..and are unfriendly and harsh on top, preferring to smoke in the lobby lounge instead of giving good service- no WLAN in rooms- the rooms are TINY

<Content>Great quirky hotel with lovely service Spent a long weekend at the Times Hotel in a canal room on the top floor. The room was built into the roof, so tall people would have to duck under some of the beams, but at 5'3 i had no problems! (My boyfriend is 6 ft and there was only the beam by the front door that he had to duck under, but the room was big enough that you didn't need to go near it again!) Painted blue, with a print on one of the walls, the room was kinda quirky. It was quite spacious, with a cute bathroom which was clean and modern. Fresh towels were provided each day, but the rooms were not tidied during our stay.The front desk was always friendly, and its 24 hours, which gives you peace of mind. There are wi-fi internet facilities in the hotel, however I didn't have my laptop with me, so they let me use their computer to check into my flight! Didn't try the breakfast in the hotel, although it looked good, but wanted to get out and about so didn't try it out. Its an additional 鈧?0 for breakfast.We paid 鈧?27 for the 3 night stay. It wasn't cheap, but it was good quality, in a good location with friendly service. I would stay again, and would definitely recommend to my friends.

<Content>Grossly overpriced I stayed at The Times Hotel in November '06 while visiting a trade fair in Amsterdam. I booked on the internet and was happy with my choice of hotel having read the reviews, I had a canal view room costing 200 euro per night. The reception is tiny and includes the few small tables at which breakfast is served. The bedroom was clean and reasonably spacious but street noise ensured a very early morning call. The decor was minimalist, bed was comfartable and bathroom ok. There were no other facilities as far as I could see. I didnt have breakfast which was not included in the bill. On paying my bill for 210 euro approx I felt I had been ripped off, this is not a 200 euro a night hotel and the experience left a bad taste on what otherwise was a very enjoyable trip.

<Content>Fantastic quirky decor! Stayed at the Times for 3 nights, had a room on the 3rd floor facing the canal so lovely view. The room was very unusually decorated with 1 wall completely covered with some form of 17th - 18th century painting (wallpaper) - fantastic! The beds were very comfortable, bathroom very clean and modern. There were a few cigarette burns on the carpet but overall the room was clean. Good location, only 5 minute walk from Dam square and friendly staff on reception all hours. There is also a very small but very nice coffee shop about 100m down the street - good way to end a day of sightseeing!

<Content>Very nice clean hotel Stayed for 1 night on a late booking.The reception were very friendy and helpful and spoke perfect English. Our room although it had no view was modern, clean, had air con and was very comfortable. As an added bonus for us non smokers it is a non smoking hotel which gives it an extra feel clean aspect. It is well situated on the a canal side some 10 min walk from Central station, and also 10min walk or so to most of the tourist spots in town. If I visit Amsterdam again I would certainly stay here again.

<Content>great stylish hotel with great location we loved this hotel. its very stylish and has a great atmosphere. the location is amazing. within walking distance to everything. if you arrive by train and have luggage, i would not walk thru the tiny streets with suitcases. hop in a taxi for 5 -7 euros. we can highly recommend this place to anyone and would stay there in a heartbeat again. there are cute outdoor cafes everywhere, so i would not have bfast at the hotel. there is also a coffeeshop right next door. the area appeared to be very safe, even though they have a tiny red light street around the corner.the rooms are small, and the walls are very thin. one morning they forgot to give us a wake up call (so bring your alarm clock) but the maid next door woke us up. the bathrooms are great. and every room has a special painting on the wall.if you are in a'dam on a sunday in the summer time, do NOT miss out on going to the beach close to zandvoort (there are trains + busses from amsterdam maybe 30mins - just ask for zandvoort ). if you love cool beach parties/lounges, you will really like the stylish bars/lounges they have there. e.g .(--). they offer food and drinks everywhere. we got there around 730pm and people were still partying from the morning hours.

<Content>smallest room I have ever stayed in, in 40 years of travel First the good news. The hotel is well located and has fantastic bathrooms. The staff is generally helpful. The place is very clean(and should be for a brand new hotel). Now the bad news. The room was so small that there was no place even to put a telephone (it was left on the floor) and had walls right next to BOTH sides of the very comfortable bed. If anyone had dropped something on either side of the bed, it would have required a crane or major piece of work to remove the bed so that the item could be recovered. We complained that this teensy room should never have been assgined to a couple and was certainly not worth the 200 euros charged and that we had to crawl out the back of the bed to get out of it and had no place to put our luggage without partially blocking either the entry to the room or the bathroom. To their credit, our rate was reduced to 140 euros, which was stilll expensive for a space that was so tiny, They also offered to change our room the second night, but by then we were leaving the next morning. So if you stay here, do check to see first what size room you are being offered.

<Content>Great hotel We just returned from a 3-nights weekend in Amsterdam, where we stayed in The Times hotel.We went there because is was just remodeled and had a good price.We really enjoyed the stay.The hotel's location on the Herengracht canal is great! it's quiet since no tram or bus are traveling there, and it's a 5-minute walk to the center, the Jordaan area, Anne Frank's museum, and to the central station.The room was remodeled in a good taste (loved the shower).We recommend it and would definitely return if in Amsterdam again.

<Content>Loved it! I stayed in this hotel twice and I loved it. Rooms are clean, new and modern. The one with the 'Nachtwacht' /' Nightwatch' painting on the wall is very special. The rooms are not really large but that doesn't matter cause it is a real hotel for tourist and not so much for business travellers. The Staff is very friendly and it is located in my favorite part of Amsterdam on the Herengracht. This where you can see and experience Amsterdam at it's best.

<Content>Brilliant cosy hotel in the best location Excellent find. Hotel only just opened after refurbishment, hence we had a great rate for the room. Room itself was small but of a very good standard, cosy, and a really nice bathroom. Staff extremely friendly and accomodating. Excellent location in the canal area, walking distance to everything.
