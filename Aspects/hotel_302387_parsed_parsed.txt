<Content>a very GRAND hotel indeed ! Handed over to Grand Pacific 4 months ago by Le Meridien.I can't recall a Hotel anywhere where there were so many eager young staff members in the lobby at all times ready to help you with anything at all, always with poise, politeness and a smile. Check in/ out and concierge were very good. The latter even sent a new Kabuki brochure under my door as soon as she got details about show times !Grand and very spacious....public areas and the room too. Was upgraded twice to a luxury room having booked a terrific rate I caught on Travelzoo. The decor is very classic....lots of cut crystal sconces, chandelier in the room (!). The door separating a roomy foyer/ makeup table closet and bathroom from the rest of the room gives extra sound insulation ...not that that mattered. Very roomy bath with separate shower, lots of counter space and a Toto washlet toilet seat! Tons of bathroom amenities, I still haven't figured some of them out ! Comfy beds and pillow, good blackout drapes. The hot water dispenser in the room was nice for making coffee and tea.Free Internet in the business center but no wireless (found virtually no wireless in Tokyo to my surprise).The Monorail to Odaiba Island is about $3 US per person/ trip but the Hotel runs a shuttle ever hour on the 1/2 hour starting at 930AM to the sister hotel in Shingawa, The Grand Pacific, where you can catch the rail line that makes a big loop around Tokyo. It seems anywhere you stay in Tokyo you have to commute to sightsee since things are spread out. I found Hotel restaurant's breakfast and menu very pricey but we did have the buffet one night at Le Bouquet but the quantity/ quality was excellent for the $39 per person (no extra tax/tip).There's a 24 hour convenience store just outside the hotel and plenty of mall type restaurants at Aqua City or Venus Fort.Note the last Airport Limousine bus from Narita to Odaiba is around 630 PM. We got in later than that so you wind up taking the bus to Shingawa at $28 each and then hoping a cab for another $35. Ouch !

<Content>Loved the Le Meridien Grand Pacific The Le Meridien Grand Pacific is an amazing hotel, the moment you walk in the door the porters take your luggage. The hotel is beautifully decorated. The Concierge desk is very helpful but some of the staff do not know a lot of English they still try and help though, or they find someone who can help you.The only bad thing I can say about this hotel is that the mattresses are extremely hard, I did read this in other reviews but thought how bad can it be, believe me they are extremely hard. Apart from that the hotel provided us with interconnecting rooms, as we travelled as a family of 4, my advice is to confirm that this is what you want about a week before you travel, they are very prompt at answering emails.Some of the restaurants have very small portion sizes, you get a much larger amount of food at a much cheaper price in the underground mall opposite the hotel. This hotel does have a bus to disneyland/sea but book it early, probably even before you get there! as it books up very fast. Disneyland/sea is all in japanese the only thing in English is the guide/map. The airport bus does come to this hotel but book that as soon as you arrive as well.

<Content>Simple Elegance I really enjoyed the Grand Pacific. It was close enough to Tokyo (15 minute monorail ride) but outside of the hustle and bustle. It was located next to AquaCity in Daiba and at AquaCity one could find more than 30 dining options which was always nice after a long day exploring Tokyo.The staff were nice and the 2,000 yen voucher for no room cleaning was similarly helpful.

<Content>Great, high class hotel First up: value for money. For about USD$150/night, this was a great hotel to stay in, its top notch.Don't want cleaning every day? They allow that. Every 2 days, you can skip, and get some money back (2000 Yen/day). This can be used to offset your hotel bill...In-room massages are available. Great when you're tired.Rooms are large. American sized. Not like how rooms in Japan are portrayed to be on TV (i.e. small). Food is nice. Lots of sushi :) Even for breakfast.Staff are helpful.If anything, the only real issue is the place is located in Daiba, which is not on the JR train line. But there's another train line just outside, that connects pretty quickly to the JRFor business, or pleasure, this is a great hotel to be at.

<Content>Le Meridien more than just a hotel! My husband and I stayed at the beautiful hotel for 3 nights. The room more than met our needs. Larger than normal hotel rooms. I cannot say enough good about them. The view was fantastic. Our only real problem was the front desk. As we did not have any Yen I tried to convert Aussie dollars to yen but they would not accept them only US or Euro. The bank hours did not open till 9am so we could not get cash out from our credit card either or use our credit card at the exchange counter. As we had an early morning tour we had to go the whole day without any cash. Only when we got back to our hotel in the evening would they accept my credit card to give us cash. The staff were very friendly and the room was made up as soon as we left it. As mentioned previously the breakfast was a bit of a problem as not able to just buy a small breakfast and the buffet was too expensive. Location was terrific with the mono rail right outside the entrance. Japan is the cleanest city I have seen so far!

<Content>The Most Perfect Hotel Le Meridien Grand Pacific is my favourite hotel. It is beautiful, luxurious, calm, the staff are unfailingly kind and helpful, and the rooms are sublimely comfortable with wonderful bathrooms and all the amenities. .The views from the rooms are superb. There are many restaurants in the hotel, bars, a lovely roof top swimming pool for summer and the greatest treasure of all, an all-year swimming pool, with steam room, sauna, Japanese baths, whirlpools and a great gym. There is also an internet room with dedicated English language terminals, and a convenience store on the ground floor which sells various snacks, drinks and souvenirs. There are a number of very good shopping centres nearby and seafront restaurants of all cuisines too, and the Ship Museum is nearby. The hotel is minutes from downtown Tokyo by lovely rail line across the Rainbow Bridge which is a treat on its own especially at night with marvellous views of Tokyo Bay and the city. Even a night at this treasure feels like a holiday. There is also an airport bus which runs from Narita Airport, all terminals, to the hotel with only brief stops at nearby hotels and takes a little more than an hour.

<Content>A good high class hotel We went for our honeymoon to Tokyo when we got married. There we joined a group tour for 5 days, then we stayed by ourselves for couple more nights in this hotel. Our trip has been good, but this hotel was the cherry on top of the cake. It was really luxurious. The interior of the hotel was really good, the service was really pleasant with most staff we talked to spoke English quite well. They are also very friendly and helpful. The room where we stayed was really good as well. Although it was the standard room, it was spacious, clean, and bright. It overlooked the old airport which was quite pretty especially at night. We also like the amenities. It has pretty much everything you need. Downstairs there is also a mini supermarket with very reasonable price.The location of the hotel is at the newly developed suburb in Tokyo. It is located very close to big shopping centres, and the new tram line. We really enjoyed this pleasant and luxurious hotel and will stay at this hotel next time we go to Tokyo for sure.

<Content>I could get used to living like this... Travelling on a budget, I used my frequent flyer miles to book a three night stay -- quite expensive at 24,000 miles/night. However, the stay was wonderful, and I could definitely get used to the four-star lifestyle.The hotel is on this Canary Warf like harbour area with its own private (and somewhat expensive) private rail line. The trade-off of the transportation time is that you are living in an oasis away from the craziness of downtown Tokyo -- there are garden promenades, gorgeous views of the city sky line, convenient shopping complexes, and a real sense of space and tranquility.The service was impressive. It might be some bizarre Japanese make-work project, but they had up to 10 people lined up to bow to you as you went from the elevator to the main entrance in the morning. They even had someone to open the automatic door for you -- lest you have to break stride because the sensor doesn't open the door fast enough for you.Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much, and we look forward to booking more reward hotel nights.

<Content>Few Benefits for Platinum Preferred Guest This hotel is not generous to Starwood Platinum Preferred Guests. You do get free access to the gym and pool and to the Club Lounge on the 27th Floor. However, the Club Lounge does not serve breakfast and although there are drinks in the evening at the lounge there is nothing to eat. As the breakfast buffet is 2800Yen this is a significant additional cost.The sister hotel Le Meridien Pacific in Shinagawa, is a much older hotel and not so nice, but there you will get a voucher for breakfast

<Content>Good option if you want to avoid craziness of downtown Tokyo I enjoyed my one night stay at this hotel. I had been traveling throughout Japan for over a week -- staying at upscale and downscale hotels. This was at the upscale end and gave one very relaxing day before flying out. I arrived at the Tokyo railway station from Kyoto and was at the hotel in 30 minutes. So it is not far. The special train you have to take is cheap -- less than US$ 3. Get in the front car for good views. Took airport bus to Narita the next day -- it leaves right from hotel. Hotel is nice. Front desk had good English skills for Japan. And, staff were extremely helpful. The breakfast buffet is pricey -- but there is a store that sells freshly baked goods and other vittles in the lobby. The area around the hotel is not exciting, but fine enough. There is a park where you can go jogging and visit a couple museums. The hotel health club is great, although there is any entry fee. However, it has nice weight room, beautiful lap pool, steam rooms, hot tub, saunas and Japanese style baths. It is well worth the expense. They gave me an extended late checkout too. Wouldn't stay here if I wanted to see Tokyo. But, it was a great place to wind down from a hectic week of tourism.

<Content>Eh. Good location, okay hotel. Right across from the Shinagawa station, well located for Tokyo.The lobby is nice and the service impeccable at check in. The garden behind the hotel is genuinely lovely. Food in the restaurants is good and reasonably priced.The room? Circa 1980 dorm. Twin beds have matresses that feel like you're sleeping on a cardboard box. Bathroom is complete, but tiny. Hair dryer is horrid, bring your own. No blow.Someone got sick in the hallway (25th floor) and they haven't figured out how to get the smell out. Avoid it for a while.Many of the rooms have been recently converted to non smoking rooms from smoking rooms. And they're still surrounded by smoking rooms. So, be prepared to change if your room still qualifies for smelly.The rooms had good water pressure and the water was hot. That was great. It's well located and the Airport shuttle stops there from Narita. Not a bad place, but request a comfort room well in advance. You'll pay extra for it, but at least the cardboard box you'll be sleeping on will have a pillow top.

<Content>American Sized Room In Japan I really enjoyed my stay at the Le Meridian. I go to Japan about once a year on business, and this was my first time staying in Odiaba. The Aqua City mall is quite close and has a great selection of restaurants of various types. There's even a McDonald's that's open 24 hours within walking distance. As another reviewer noted, there were a lot of unique amenities in the room, including a women's skin care kit (including a makeup remover cloth and a cloth with the cleanser embedded in it). The gym was pretty expensive ($10 extra per visit), but there is a pedestrian area not too far from the hotel, so if you're just looking for a place to run, I'd recommend outside. In addition, note that breakfast at this hotel is a nice buffet, but it costs almost $30. If you order a la carte, it ends up being almost that much anyway. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Modern Amenities with Convenience I've stayed at Le Meridien twice. As with everything in Japan, I received superb service. This hotel is very convenient to the Tokyo Big Sight, where I was attending a trade show, but it was also convenient to get to downtown within 20 minutes and Ginza within 25. My only complaint is that the Internet access is slower than I would have expected for a hotel this modern.Be sure to take advantage of their environmentally friendly policy of giving you $20/day that you don't want your room serviced. For folks traveling alone, this is a great perk. I usually spend my extra money in their gift shop getting trinkets for friends back home.

<Content>Good hotel - but too far out of Tokyo city I have just come back from a five day business trip to Tokyo, It was my first visit, so I wasnt sure about where to stay so I picked a hotel group that I know and chose the Meridien.The hotel is in a district called Daiba - which is in a great settingoverlooking the harbour and bridge - so it looks very impressive at night.The hotel is fairly classic in a big business/conference venue type hotel kind of way - reminds me very much of an American hotel. That said, the rooms were nice and comfortable - an important thing for me is the beds having Duvets - which were very nice and comfortable.The bathroom again was clean and nice - one thing the Meridien does very well is the range of things in the bathroom - you really neednt take anything. There was a headband, cotton wool, moisturiser, toner, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, cotton buds, bath salts, toothbrush, toothpaste ....even pjamas ..you could have just turned up and it was all there.The toilets in Japan are just a hoot ..and its great to have one in the privacy of your own room as you can fiddle about with it and get to know it which you cant really do in the public version. There is a nice heated seat, a water spray at two diferent angles, a flushing noise and a nice little air jet ...if you are a westerner, expect to be very suprised by your first experience!Room service at the hotel was very good and I would reccomend the hotel in general. For me, I needed to be in and out of the city quitefrequently - and the hotel is definately too far away for that - it took me 40 minutes to get to places like Roppongi and Harajuku from there and cost between 3,000 and 5,000 yen each way. It's much more spacious and airy than the rest of Yokyo but lacks the vibrancy of the city. A colleague of mine was staying at the Grand Hyatt in Roppongi - which looked much more at the heart of things.All in all though, can't complain about the hotel itself.
