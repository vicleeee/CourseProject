<Content>Reasonable The kind of place where you stay because of location. Right in Plazza Catalonia and 3 min from Ramblas, metro. As the airport bus has it's terminal in Plazza Catalonia it also made for a cheap airport transfer.The lobby and corridors look pretty old and outdated. The concierge staff was alright, although they had a time-span of 1 min in their explanations after which they were moving on something else. Perhaps they were very busy.Breakfast was very good, the buffet is stored with little gourmet dishes which I thought was very thoughtfull trying to change a bit the American buffet routine. Also the service in the breakfast room was very good, fast and efficient.We've tried the bar at 1st floor one evening and it was awesome. The bartender will fix you a Sangria and will chat with you about Barcelona and Spain. He obviously likes to entertain.What I didn't like was the room. Old blankets, old furniture. Almost no decorations. It felt worse than IBIS. As it was pretty cold during the night, we had to stuff some bed covers on the windows side because of the cold coming from there. we had a room at pool level, basically there was a plant-fence in fron of us.What I did like in the room configuration was the door between the room and hall. It isolated the room from the noise.If I'll come back it will be for the location and breakfast.

<Content>Great Location, great value Booked this last minute, to be honest, purely on discounted rate and location basis. Travelled with family group of 16 people, so cost was a factor, to keep everyone happy. Double rooms were 78 Euros, triple, 114 Euros. Staff were very pleasant and helpful and location was perfect for everything. Rear facing rooms overlook a small pool, unfortunately not heated in winter. Breakfast was good, at 15 Euros pp.On checking out a few of the other hotels we had been considering, this hotel was probably the best of the bunch.

<Content>Great Hotel - Great Location Very friendly staff. Everyone was happy to communicate in English. The hotel is located steps from the main city center which makes it great for sightseeing. The breakfast was delicous! Our room overlooked the pool and was clean and modern. Would recommend to anyone. If you've had a few too many sangrias just mention the name of the hotel to the cab driver. They all seemed to know where it was.

<Content>Very Unpleasant Stay I stayed at this hotel for two nights. The room was absolutely freezing and when I asked the reception staff for the heating to be put on she said no but she would send a blanket to my room (I already had two extra blankets!). The bath had not been cleaned and my friend had her bag stolen in the foyer right in front of the reception staff and she did nothing. She even wanted to charge my friend for the phonecall to the police!

<Content>Great hotel in an ideal location Having lived in Barcelona for six months, I knew this hotel was located in a very convenient location, less than 1/2 mile from Las Ramblas and Paseo de Gracia. The hotel is very nicely decorated and has a GREAT breakfast buffet. The staff is courteous and helpful if you need any information about restaurants, attractions, etc. The hotel is a great value for the price.

<Content>Excellent stay! We were not on the rooming list on arrival but that was presumably the fault of Expedia! Having said that got a good room next to the suites on the 7th floor. Large comfortable bed, good bathroom with plenty of towels, changed daily. Very good buffet breakfast, so fill yer boots! Location is terrific and staff were very pleasant. Just don't recognise the bad reviews.

<Content>Bad service The hotel foyer will give you a great impression, but for us it was all down hill from there. The hotel is run down by the standards set by its competitors at around the same price point, and the service is particularly lacking. Our room was shabby and had almost nil natural light. We packed up and moved across the road to The Pulitzer which was slightly more expensive but worlds apart in product and service.

<Content>Family fun in Barcelona I have just returned from a 5 day break in Barcelona staying at Catalonia Duques De Bergara Hotel. The Hotel is cleaning a welcoming, Staff very friendly and efficent with checking in procedures. When booked i had asked for the two rooms to be next door to each other and also asked for a cot in one of the rooms the rooms were situated next door but one to each other and there was a cot in the double room complete with pillow and duvet.The Rooms We had two room one double and one twin, The room were clean and the bathroom was well stocked with complermenty toiletries on arrivle. The bed were comfy but a little short for average size person as leg would hang off the end. The room had air com which worked efficently. The bathroom was clean and big bath towels supplyed and changed everyday. I did have a little difficulty using the shower the temperture taps were on the wall oppisite the bath a shower and its was hard to regulate the temp of the water the showers was either too hot or too cold. There was a mini bar in the room which we took full advantage of.We were on the 4th floor and had 2 year old with us and didnt find the windows very secure you only had to flick handle and the window open wide very dangerous for children.The Pool And Bar Area It was clean and all bar staff very friendly all ready for a chat. The pool area quite small but never too crowed always some where to sit. The pool was suffient size but it wasnt heated and the water always very cold even after the sun had been on it all day. There were towels by the pool to use the put straight in th laundry bag provided.Breakfast Breakfast was betwwen 8 and 10.30 so need to rush in the morning, it was always well maintained nothing ever ran out what ever time you went. I would recommend the apple crossients had to have one every morning.Didnt eat dinner at hotel but the menu looked good but little expencive.LocationHotel situated about 5mins away from metro station and airport bus stops 5mins from hotel and only costs 4 euros. Les Ramble is 2 min away.I had pleasent experience staying at this hotel a would recommend it. It is suitable for anyone from families to honeymooners the girly weekends away.

<Content>Great find We arrived in Barcelona after a long flight only to find out that the a/c was broken in our previously booked hotel. We started making phone calls to find a new one and came across Duques de Bergara through pure luck. The lobby was grand and our room was spotless. Our a/c worked very well, the beds were super-comfy and our bathroom was all marble and very nice. We had a tiny balcony overlooking the entrance to the hotel and could see part of Placa Catalunya. We had a noise  light blocking door leading out to the balcony so the room was pitch black and silent while we were sleeping (maybe too much)! Location is very convenient too, not far from Las Ramblas and very close to transportation. The airport bus drops you very close by and is a bargain for 4 (or 5?) euros. Plus, El Corte Ingles in Placa Catalunya is my new favorite department store!

<Content>Absolutely Disasterous We are pretty well-traveled and have stayed at a variety of hotels, BBs, etc from -5-star to basic. This by far was the worst hotel experience we've had. We checked into a room with a smelly bathroom, and stinky tile floor. The room was overall pretty run down, with old, scratched up paint on the walls, and old furniture. We couldn't sleep because of the offensive smell. So we complained and asked to be moved. They first offered to clean our room, which did not help with the smell. The room we were moved to was even WORSE, and SMALLER in size. We rejected that, threatened to move out, and were offered a third room. When we lied down in bed, we discovered BUGS crawling all over us. We catapulted out of bed, and out of that hotel. Checked into a nice boutique hotel (same price) 3 blocks away, and finally enjoyed Barcelona.

<Content>Perfect location Stayed here for 5 nights to attend a conference - I was in room 527 at the front of the hotel.The room was a little small but had the benefit of a good sized balcony with table and chair great for chilling out, sunbathing enjoying a drink.No tea or coffee making facilities so if you fancy a drink take your own bottle opener and snacks! You could use the mini-bar in your room but I guess it's probably pretty expensive. The room has a decent bathroom with all you'd want. The room was serviced every day and left immaculate.What makes this hotel recommended is:1. The Location - it's just off the Cataluyna Plaza which is the heart of all the transport links. The metro line is superb - buy a ticket with 20 journey's it's much cheaper. You can also get the airport bus direct from the Plaza. Just off the plaza is the famous La Ramblas. The Plaza and La Ramblas are very busy popular areas but this hotel is just off in what is surprisingly a quiet street.2. The Breakfast (food and the service) - buffet eat as much as you like with a very wide range always kept in good supply, always tidied and kept neat. In fact the staff are just so attentive, warm and provide an excellent service. Topping up your coffee is no hassle someone is floating around all the time looking after you. The food is good quality. The freshly baked cakes and donuts are highly recommended! 3. The Pool - on the first floor there is an open air (small) swimming pool -surrounded by gardens, trees, shrubs with a good supply of chairs and sun bed. Towels provided too. This is a lovely relaxing haven from busy city life.4. The Architecture - the hotel was designed by Gaudi's teacher - the doorwar and staircase has all the hallmarks.5. The staff - all pleasant and helpful - especially breakfast staff.The only downside was that the aircon didn't seem to be working - so a huge vertical fan was installed in my room which was fine - left on too long air con leaves me with a dry throat.The room was a little small -but they are all different.But I'd recommend this hotel!

<Content>Perfect location for Barcelona tourism Duques de Bergara is a tourist and business hotel. Having been to Barcelona before, I chose this hotel for price and because it was close to Las Ramblas without actually being in the thick of it, and it was well-placed for seeing other districts as well. The hotel, while almost on the Plaza Catalunya, is amazingly on a quiet street. It is a few meters from plaza, just at the top of Las Ramblas, where several metro lines and the train converge. You can walk from the hotel to most of the major areas with the exception of Montjuic. A nice bonus was the rooftop pool and very pleasant bar, which made for a calming apres-tourism oasis. I had a double room looking on an airshaft, but that was not a worry. It meant no street noise. I wasn't in the room so much. The bed was really comfy, just soft enough to rest me well after long days of wandering around. The sheets were really high-quality, and I appreciated that. The room had climate control. My only disappointment is that the room seemed rather plain and under-decorated for this class of hotel. There was a separate door between the bedroom and the entry foyer. That was useful, as the hotel has marble floors and sounds echoed. The bathroom, off the foyer, was spacious with a full size tub and nice big towels, changed every day. However, the ceiling vent fan was not working. One thing I did not like, as this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel, is that they charge by the day to rent a lock for the in-room safe. That should just be part of the deal.The staff at the front desk was helpful for my needs. They have only one internet station in the lobby and it is terribly expensive. There are internet places down in the Las Ramblas areas for 1/10th the price.There is so much great food in Barcelona, yet one night I was lazy and ate at the hotel restaurant. It was excellent with fine service, not overpriced, and I would recommend at least one meal there. Breakfast, though expensive, is quite good, too. For outside meals, tapas is found everywhere. I recommend El Taller de Tapas, an upscale place for outstanding quality and preparation and a great winelist. I liked it so much, I went 2 nights in a row. There's one in the Eixample district and one in the Born district. This is their website, to help you find it: http://www.tallerdetapas.com/

<Content>Don't understand the poor ratings - good stay Now I can't comment on value for money because I was staying as a guest of the Barcelona Ocean Racing Foundation. And maybe being hooked into a major Barcelona sporting event got me privileged treatment BUTI was originally in a room overlooking the admittedly quiet street but asked for and got a room change to overlook the central courtyard - which was blissfully peaceful. The room was big enough, clean, comfortable and well equipped - although I didn't get the bathrobe and slippers that I had at the sister hotel (Catalonia Ramblas) previously. The breakfast was excellent. We drank in the bar - which was very quiet and where service had to be summoned by a bell. But the bartender was competent enough. My colleague reported that the dinner he had in the hotel restaurant was good. The reception staff were slightly defensive about the hotel - which is old and which was renovated some time ago unlike the Catalonia Ramblas. But all the fixtures and fitings were modern, the TV had all the cable channels etc. The staff were proud of the historical connections with the architect who actually was Gaudi's teacher. And the hall well up to the bar had all its art deco features retained - very nicely done. I thought that although the rooms were clearly older than at the Catalonia Ramblas they were more practical - there were hooks on the back of doors, plenty of coathangers etc. I got on with the Lithuanian/Slovakian/Ukrainian/Spanish reception staff. So for my weekend stay the hotel gets a clean bill of health. I would go back.

<Content>Ideal location The previous reviews for this hotel weren't great and the poor quality photos of the interior led me to expect a very dated, slightly shabby hotel. However on arrival I was very pleasantly surprised - the location was superb - two steps of the Placa Catalunya and a minute from the airport bus stop and metro - the exterior building was beautiful, as was the entrance way. Once inside the staff were friendly and the room, particularly the bathroom, was a very good size with a balcony with a nice table and chairs overlooking the pool. Everything was very clean and presentable. Breakfast was an excellent selection served until 11am on the weekend (10.30am weekday) which suited us, although the food could have been a little hotter.

<Content>Excellent Hotel and Location We have just returned from our first visit to Barcelona. Like others I was concerned to read some of the reviews of the hotel but on arrival our fears were quickly allayed. We were welcomed by very friendly reception staff and were delighted with our room on the sixth floor - a really good sized room with double bed, small sitting area, mini bar with reasonably priced drinks, large marble tiled bathroom with shower and - best of all - a spacious terrace with seating which overlooked the rooftops. The room was also air-conditioned. The hotel is ideally situated just yards from Placa Catalunya and the top of La Rambla - all the tour buses leave from here and the nearest metro station is a couple of minutes walk. Despite being close to all the action the hotel is really quiet - very few cars pass by on street outside - it is really only for taxis dropping off and picking up - and so we had four nights of very peaceful sleep. Breakfasts were wonderful - an excellent range of hot and cold dishes and the most wonderful little pastries which were baked on the premises. The staff were so friendly and helpful and constantly ensured that there were sufficient supplies of everything and also walked round topping up coffees. A lovely light dining area with quiet music in the background ensured that we had a really nice start to the day - plus a little glass of the cava that was available was also a nice little luxury! We made use of the bar on a couple of the evenings and the barman was delightful - couldn't have been more helpful and was so friendly. Also on the day of our departure the reception staff were really helpful - storing our luggage while we had a last walk before leaving for our flight - and then calling a taxi and taking our luggage out - special thanks to the really friendly bellboy. I could not recommend this hotel more highly - it really contributed so much to our first visit to Barcelona - and I would have no hesitation in returning there.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay. I must admit I was a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews for this hotel but I needn't have worried.We had two rooms on the 5th floor and both were clean and in good condition. The triple glazing ensured there was no noise from the traffic.We found all the staff pleasant and helpful.The location is excellent - close to the Placa Catalunya and the Ramblas but set on a quiet side street.We had breakfast as part of our package and really enjoyed it - I really enjoyed the doughnuts and little lemon cakes. We found it kept us going all day until the evening.I would definately return to this hotel.

<Content>really convenient hotel This hotel is just off the main square of placa de catalonia where all the transport from and to the airport comes into. It is at the top of la rambla, which is very convenient for walking. My husband and i stayed there for 5 nights and found the hotel in great condition. Staff on reception very friendly and helpful. Swimming pool aswell but had no time to use it but looked clean and tidy. Nice calm modern bar area on first floor. Looked at menu in restaurant but was very expensive and didnt look to have much atmosphere but probably because not too many diners because of price. Try not to be too seduced by eating on la rambla cos a lot of the restaurants are poor but with high prices!! The Attic was an exception! The food was of a high standard and a good price aswell so obviously with that you have to queue usually around half an hour but only found out on our night home that we could have booked and not had the wait. SO BOOK!! Also 'le quatre gats' was very good and very authentic bohemian style interior. I had the monkkfish and it was cooked perfectly. A little pretentious i suppose but good value 3 course and bottle of wine for around 拢60!! All menus in english so no embarassment.The beach from this hotel is about a 25-30 min walk down la rambla and to the left but you can take a metro just outside hotel. It was very clean but too many massage women constantly looking to massage you on beach. I must have been asked about 10 times one afternoon, i even pretended to be asleep but they tried to wake me!! Watch out for pick pockets cos la rambla is very very busy...nearly as busy as oxford st at christmas!! but very entertaining with street performances. Barcelona is a great city for culture and relaxation and i would definitely recommend this hotel and the city to visit..oh great shopping too!!!

<Content>Nice lobby and location Everything else not good The lobby is beautiful and you are a block away from Las Ramblas. Other than that I would not stay here. There are 4 of us (two adults two children) and we booked a room for 4 and received a room for 3. They were not accomadating and had a take it or leave it atitude. The room had a musty smell. The front desk was rude. The pool area was small and dirty.This was our last stop in Spain (Madrid, Seville, Marbella) and all other hotels were great (Hotel Emperador in Madrid, Hotel Ingleterra in Seville and Marriott Vacation Club in Marbella). This place was bad.Barcelona is a beautiful city with great attractions, great food and a wonderful atmosphere. The people are wonderful other than at this hotel. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!

<Content>7 lad City Break Stayed for 2 nights for lads weekend, great location literally yards from La Rambla and Metro station. Stayed in room 206 second floor room looked out onto main street but no problem of noise as double doors on verander.Room was cleaned every day, mini bar priced reasonably cheap $3 euros for the small bottles of Fanta, coke, and $12 euros for the small bottle of Cava. Breakfast was open till 11 every morning while we were there, didn't have any problems with the food, continental stuff wide selection of meats, cheese etc, for all you englanders they had proper bacon and real sausages all be it small ones decent scramble egg and fried eggs on bread.The pool area was cool. but wouldn't like to have one of the rooms on the first floor that leads to the bar I think its rooms 117 - 125 can imagine it gets loud if people are going to the bar at night, but hotel seemed to be quite empty. Marco the italian bar man was nice. Great location would defo recommend didn't have any problems with pick pockets outside hotel but can't see anyone messing with 5 scousers and 2 well spoken southerners !! So good for big parties and couples as the bar area had couches and quite areas surrounding it. central to everywhere defo worth 拢50 a night for a few days at least. if anyone would like to ask any specific questions drop me a line.

<Content>WORST BREAKFAST WORLDWIDE We just spent some happy days in the beautiful and enjoyable city of Barcelona. The hotel is walking distance from Plaza Catalunya and there you can take the underground which takes you anywhere. Careful with the thiefs at las Ramblas and even at the Hotel Lobby.This place, which is as central as it can be contains the best and the worst of what you would expect at a Hotel.In fact no queries would have been found if we had not have breakfast the last day of our stay in which we had to suffer how baddly the staff could be trated by the Restaurant's manager.We were having breakfast and that person which was supposed to be in charge (Giseppe) shouted, and apparently tried to be laughing of his own staff. That was really embarasing for us because the service was being very friendly and kind. In fact the service provided by Giseppe was nasty and seemed to be a favour. A favour that was not for free, of course. Disgusting. Rude.Avoid breakfast and your stay will be as enjoyable as ours should have been.

<Content>Quality 15 of us on a football trip stayed here over a weekend in November. To be honest it wasn't the first choice but other hotels were not prepared to take 15 (ageing) blokes - their loss.However, top marks to the Duques de Bergara. Location perfect, next to Place de Catalunya and metro station. Rooms were generally sapcious, clean, modern, with good washing facilities and toiletries provided. And (important for us) twin rooms meant twin rooms (not doubles !).Staff were friendly and polite, and (minor point) there was an endless supply of fruity sweets at reception.Breakfast outstanding - continental and English.Considering what we paid, real value for money.As for Barca, glorious sunshine, plenty to see, cheap beer and food at Cafe Zurich (1 minute away from the hotel). As the guide books tell you, don't stray off La Ramblas at night and if you want an alternative to the Nou Camp, try the Olympic Stadium (fantastic views of the city and beyond) and watch Espanyol.Quality hotel, quality city.

<Content>Treat Yourself Stayed for 3 nights from 10th to 13th November 2006.Location is excellent, within 50 metres of the tour bus terminus and at the top of La Rambla.Staff are extremely friendly and give excellent advice on restaurants, places to see and travelling within Barcelona.Rooms are not huge but are more than adequate for top end tourist class. The bathroom is a good size and has an excellent over bath shower.Rooms and public areas are very clean and tidy and the bar is excellent for the final drink of the evening. Didn't use the pool but it is smaller than the photographs suggest.The continental breakfast was excellent with a very wide range of cold and cooked foods.Would throughly recommend the hotel as a great base for exploring this magnificent city.

<Content>Great hotel, great location Good spacious room with all the usual facilities, ie mini bar, sky tv, safe etc. First class breakfast, choice unlimited, hot or cold. Staff were really helpful and friendly. The pool and surrounding area are small, nice for relaxing after a hard days sightseeing but not for a poolside holiday. Excellent location, just beside Catalonia plaza where you catch the open top buses to take you to any sightseeing destination and right at the top of Las Ramblas. This was our second time at this hotel and also recommended it to friends who were just as delighted as us. Must sees:- Nou Camp stadium (even the wife enjoyed it). Recommend buying a bus pass for at least 2 days, easiest way to travel.

<Content>Nice hotel, ideal location I stayed for 10 nights in June/2006. I enjoyed my stay. The room was clean, nice size. Bathroom was quite large and clean. People at the reception were friendly and helped me with directions. Internet access in hotel but quite pricy. I had a good deal at 134 Euros a night, probably because I was part of a conference group.The best part is its location. It is right off of Placa de Catalunya and Las Ramblas. At the price that I paid, it was a good deal.

<Content>Expected a lot, and got it! Fantastic location - a quiet street yet a matter of metres from the main square. Room was to the front of the property yet got no noise at all. Only there for two nights, though we asked quite a bit of the staff and apart from a guest room subsequent to check out, they were always able to deliver, even when just asking for recommendations etc. Beds were good sized, comfortable twins. Spacious bathroom, plenty enough room in the twin-sized room that was shared between three adults. Bonus of a small pool and nice terrace bar, not always expected in a city centre location.

<Content>The staff hate Americans! The staff were rude, spiteful, and went out of their way to make my stay unpleasant. The room was average, the breakfast not so bad. If you in any way resemble an American, look elsewhere. The only one staff person who spoke English worked in the morning and she was absolutely unbelievably nasty.

<Content>bad hotel, beautiful city The excellent localisation is the only good thing of this hotel.Noisy, small rooms, small beds (you pay for a 4* but they give you a room of 2*). Attention in the check out... don麓t make calls from the hotel, don麓t drink anything in the bar. They put things in your room account that you didn麓t used. Be carefull!Enjoy Barcelona ... in another hotel.

<Content>Great city and hotel Very good hotel,great location. I was suprised at the choices of food available at breakfast.The bar area is comfortable and all of the staff friendly. We stayed over new year and had a great gala meal, but please try to remember to cook the meat a little longer,also the open bar could have been better organised. My wife and I both enjoyed the music and dancing.

<Content>Fantastic Location We stayed at the Catalonia Duques de Bergara for a 3 night break. The hotel is in a great location by Plaza de Catalunya. It's the perfect location for the Ramblas, or to walk to the more upmarket areas of Eixample. The hotel is just off the main square. There are numerous great shops within a stones throw of the hotel. Our room was on the top floor facing the main road and we had virtually no street noise thanks to quality double glazing. The room itself was very small, but that said it was clean, comfortable, and had all the features you'd expect. We were on the 5th floor and had a huge balcony which got the sun for most of the day and gave you great views of the city. The hotel provides breakfast. If you're a big eater go for it. It has the usual cooked breakfast, cheeses, cold meats, fruit and cereal, all of which were excellent. The only down side being the coffee which unusually for Spain was not good! The pool is lovely and a great retreat after a day walking around the city.If you book ask for a room away from the cleaners cupboards. Our's was opposite it and it did get a bit noisy from about 8am.In summary a great location, good food, excellent facilities and a great base for seeing Barcelona.

<Content>Perfect choice for a stay in Barcelona We (family with 15 year old daughter) just returned from a two week stay in this (beautifully styled) hotel. We had one double and one twin room on the top (6th) floor, both with a large balcony on the street side. We enjoyed the spacious, airconditioned rooms and the luxurious, marble bathrooms. Rooms were bright and clean and contained, apart from a minibar and TV, a wall-cupboard with sufficient space for all our clothes. Each room costed us about 鈧?100,- per room per night, incl. taxes, which is certainly not expensive for this (4-star-)standard.Breakfast in this hotel may be a bit expensive (鈧?13 p.p.) , but the buffet offers everything you can imagine (scrambled eggs, saucages, muesli, cheese, hams, marmelades, fruits, fresh fruit juices and, of course, coffee nd tea). Especially for people who like to fill their plates several times, this price cannot be beaten. In case you only breakfast with a croissant and coffee, you'd better take one of the bars or cervecerias at the nearby Rambla Catalunya.The hotel is ideally located in a quiet side street just off Plaza Catalunya and we doubt there is a better priced hotel with the same quality in central Barcelona.The (small) swimming pool is a nice addition, even though the chairs are mostly occupied when you return from the city after 3 pm. The service of the staff is OK. The receptionists are very helpful (e.g. when my wallet with credit cards was stolen downtown). The restaurant offers a good choice of Spanish cuisine, although the atmosphere is a bit too formal, which is about the only (slight) criticism we have on this hotel.In all respects: a perfect choice for a stay in Barcelona.
