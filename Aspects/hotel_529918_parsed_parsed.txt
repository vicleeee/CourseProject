<Content>A dependable, affordable spot in a great foodie area I had a nice little room with a decent bathroom. It was pretty decent for the price, I'd say. The staff were lovely. There was free internet in the lobby (on one computer only and a little popular, so sometimes you had to wait!)There is a great little creperie around the corner (Chez Imogene) and lots of fantastic foodie streets nearby. I really love this area of the Republique - there is some bargain food, some wonderful boutiques and you can walk up to the Canal St Martin. Wonderful!

<Content>Solid experience. I came over to Paris from Canada to spend a week with a friend from law school  show her around France. We stayed at the Hotel Plessis, and got off to a rough start, but by the end, were happy we stayed there.The rough start was that we were sent to a room that had not been attended to by a maid, and was above-average dirty--cigarrette buts, dirty sheets, etc...this was a minor, five-minute inconvenience, but after a 20-hour travel day, it was not so cool.Our bags were lost (thanks, Air Canada), but the hotel staff were helpful in tracking them down.One semi-annoying thing about this place is that you have to give your room-key to the desk clerk everytime you go out, which gives it kind of a hostel feel.We never ate breakfast there, as there are two good bakeries just around the corner, which offer pastries for 1/10th the price, and then you can take them to a caf茅 to eat with a caf茅 cr猫me, and experience French caf茅 living!As for location, I would recommend staying somewhere near the Bastille as opposed to R茅publique...there just seems to be more to do there.I do not have photos of my room on this computer, but will try to post them later.Cheers,Winston.

<Content>Good value for Paris We stayed here in late May for 5 nights. The room was typical of European standards and included a double bed, 2 chairs, fan, TV, counter/table, closet, sink, toilet, bidet, and tub with shower nozzle. Free internet was provided at a terminal near the lobby and we used it a couple times but it was usually being used by others. It was a rather slow connection. The staff said wifi was also available and although my Pocket PC could identify it I could never connect. The hotel is located in the 11th Arrondissement (northeast of the Marais) and a 5 minute walk to either the Oberkampf or Republique Metro stops. It is not real close to any big tourist sites but the Metro provides easy transportation to everything. It is close to a boulangerie and a Monoprix supermarket and many cafes. It seems like a very safe neighborhood. We were looking for reasonably low priced accomodation in Paris and feel we found it with Hotel Plessis. We reserved by email about 2 1/2 months prior to our visit and paid 75 Euros per night. Breakfast is available for extra cost.

<Content>Good value Stayed here 3 nights in late May and found the hotel to have a good value for the price. As such the room was very small but pretty clean. Location was good, not that much noise during the night. Staff was friendly and the breakfast was good. Not the best hotel in the world but with these prices worth a stay.

<Content>Good Value, Great Staff We stayed at the Hotel Plessis for three nights in May and found the hotel to be a good value for the money. The room was European sized but had sufficient storage spaces and cubby-holes for two people. Our fifth floor room included a TV, wall-mounted fan, double bed, and a balcony with patio table and two chairs. The bathroom was reasonably sized although the shower was a bit small even for a slender person. The shower mechanism was not properly mounted which meant more water flowed onto the wall than the person, but there was plenty of hot water and clean towels. The staff were terrific. I arrived with a large and heavy suitcase to find routine maintenance being conducted on the elevator. The desk staff person carried my bag up to the fifth floor without complaint and refused a tip. The staff took the time to provide directions, answer questions, and were generally quite helpful. The hotel is located just two blocks from Place de la Republic and a metro stop with several different lines, convenient to most Paris locations. Although the city is noisy, most sounds did not penetrate to our room, so sleep was restful and the fan was helpful with the warm temperatures. We did not take advantage of the breakfast service.

<Content>Nice clean hotel Me and my sister stayed at Hotel Plessis for 2 nights. The rooms were not big but from what we gathered from the rest of the reviews, that is typical of Paris standards. The beds were comfortable and the toilet was clean for both nights. There isn't much of a view out of the window but it was still pretty nice looking out to the roofs of other Parisian houses. The hotel isn't too far from the Metro [Republique] (but not that near either). It is perfectly fine if you have manageable luggage. We had a 29inch, 32kg luggage which was not fine at all for two 156cm ladies when most of the Metros did not have elevators nor lifts (except for the major stops). There is a very nice bakery just at the corner of the street where the hotel is. My sis loved the strawberry tart! All in all, a good deal for Paris if you want a quieter option away from all the buzz.

<Content>Great place to stay For my first trip to Paris I was very happy with this hotel. The staff was so friendly and helpful. Most of them spoke enough English to communicate, and they even helped us confirm our taxi reservations. They helped us find restaurants and the local metro stations.The rooms are nothing fancy but they served the purpose. Ours was a good size and had a really nice window. Our travel companions even had a balcony. The bathrooms have a towel warmer. The elevator is small, and you could fit two people comfortably, but any luggage will makes things a bit tight. The breakfast included croissants and breads, ham, cereal, coffee, orange juice, and other small pastries. We ate at the hotel several times when we had an early start. This is a great hotel for budget travelers, and I would stay there again.

<Content>Decent place to stay--which room makes a difference Well, we booked through Venere so didn't get a chance to request non-smoking or 2 twin beds, but they did have our reservation and were fine with us arriving at 11pm (hotel guests need to be in by 1am so possibly check-in until then might be okay). According to guy at the desk, all rooms have been non-smoking since Jan, which pretty much means that poeple are no longer supposed to smoke in them. The first room(433) we got reeked of smoke as soon as we opened the door--couldn't even bear to enter it. My friend went back downstairs (more on the stairs later) and got a room that had always been non-smoking 432. We entered that one and it was significantly better. At 11:30pm, I just wanted somewhere to sleep that didn't gag me. My friend had a lot more trouble sleeping with the faint smoke smell--we're both from CA which has been public building non-smoking for a long time. Personally, I would notice the smoke right when I entered the room and after a minute I adjusted to it and it just smelled a little musty. The bathroom was decently sized and very clean with doors on the shower (and a heated towel rack). Also, the pillows in that room were the lumpiest I have ever seen.I went back downstairs to talk to the guy at reception (who was very nice) and he said the room had always been non-smoking, but they can't control whether or not people smoke in there. The next day I talked to the lady (also very nice) at reception and she said she would try to get us into a less smoky room with 2 twin beds. That evening when we got back they had keys ready for us to switch to room 428, which had no smoke smell and 2 twins--great room! The bathroom was smaller (with no heated towel rack) and we got water on the floor when we showered as it only had a curtain, but as those were not nearly as important to us, we were very happy with the room. Also, the pillows were normal in that room.I was pleased that they went out of their way to accomodate us (though admittedly, without a less smoky room we would probably have checked out the next day and gone somewhere else). However, they were very nice and pleasant about everything. The cleaning person did a very good job and the room was well cleaned with fresh towels each day. I tipped her 1Euro each day, which seemed to result in slightly nicer and extra towels,which helped with the water on the floor.The stairway seems designed for people to go down, but not up so much. As most in Europe, it is small, but it is also round (3/4 circle from floor to floor) and winding so the step size varies from the inside to the outer side of the step, which can be tricky. In daylight, that's no prob, but at night there are only the lights on the floors (triggered by light sensors) to light the way, which are sufficient. The problem is that they are set up to trigger when someone in halfway down from one floor to the one below (i.e. floor 2's light go one when you are halfway down from floor 3 to 2). If you are going upstairs at night the light on the floor doesn't come on until you actually set foot on the floor so the last half or the steps are in almost total darkness. To make a long story short, at night take the small, but sufficient elevator to get upstairs. The internet worked fine when we were there after I discovered the trick of using Modzilla instead of Internet Explorer. The computer froze up when I tried to use IE and I had to do a hard boot (unplug) to get it working again. From then on, I just used Modzilla and had no problems, much faster, no freezing.There were also some good books downstairs in the lounge area that I read while I was there.FOODOverall, I was very happy with my stay and I would stay there again. I paid 77Euros for the room with double bed and 78Euros for the room with 2 twins. Total stay 4 nights.For food, the crepe place 1/2 block down (on the way to Oberkampf Metro) was good--had a ham and cheese to go for 4.80Euro. The patisserie across the street from the crepe place had excellent croissants .80Euros and .85Euros for buttered. The grocery store around the corner (2 doors down from the crepe place...Fran-something) was great for water (1.12E for 6 pack of .5L bottles) and a reasonably (for France) priced Milka choc. bar (2E--more expensive than Italy). Our favorite place to eat was la Rose de France in Place Dauphine near the Louvre and Notre Dame. Entrees were 13E and main courses 19E, but the 26E meal let you choose one of each and the portions were solid. For appetizers, we tried the cheese and cold cuts platter, which was excellent and very filling, the escargots, which were not that filling (but more of a delicacy) in a nice pesto sauce, and a wonderful salad that they adjusted to a starter size, which was still quite a nice size. For dinner, the best thing we had was the lamb kabobs--could eat those every day! They also came with a mouth-watering vegetable terrine. Cafe Constant (135 Saint Dominique by the Eiffel Tower) also had excellent food. A little more fancy, small portions--very French (and very good) though I was glad I had a big lunch. 11E for starter (seafood ravioli which was 1 ravioli), 15E for main course.Also had the falafel special a couple times at L'As du Falafel, 34 rue des Rosiers nearest the Saint Paul Metro stop. Very good and only 5E.We were fortunate to wander by Boulangerie des Deux Ponts (35 rue des Deux Ponts) at 5:30 on Tuesday and they were clearing out their pasteries, choose 3 for 4E (about half-price). We picked out 6 and they were all devine!ATTRACTIONSThe Louvre and many other museums/attractions are free the first Sunday of the month. We went to the Louvre, but as my friend later pointed out, perhaps we should have checked out 4 other places that day and later paid 1 admission for the day at the Louvre.Also, there is a great plaza that overlooks the Eiffle Tower (good photo ops)--it's right by the Trocadero Metro stop.GETTING THEREWe came via Ryanair into Beauvais Airport and took the bus (13Euro) to Porte Maillot Metro stop on Line 1 transferring to Line 5 at Bastille. We flew out of CDG so we took Metro Line 5 to Gard du Nord and then took the RER (from platform 43) to CDG (8.2E).

<Content>Great Stay Great Hotel.... We stayed 5 nights over New Years - it was a great trip. The hotel is located in Republique - grocery stores, bakeries, metro, resturaunts, all very, very close to the hotel. The reception was very helpful and hospitable. Helped us find fireworks for New Year's Eve, called to confirm our shuttle to the airport, and were very pleasant, even at 1 am. Would totally recommend.... great place to stay if you are traveling on a budget.

<Content>Great little gem in Paris I found the Hotel Plessis to be a fabulous find in Paris. I was a little sceptical as it was only 拢50 per night and a 2 star but i needant have worried. The hotel was very clean, with a decent sized room and the staff were very friendly and helpfull. There is also a good selection of maps etc at the reception that you can help yourself to inorder to get around Paris with ease.Our room also had a balcony but i am not sure if this is the case with every room. The bathroom was pretty small but had everything you needed, including a hair dryer and the shower had really good water pressure. I did not sample the breakfast in the hotel as there were plenty of places nearby but i did hear from other guests that it was good value for money (6 euro 50).The area in which the hotel is situated is very Parisian which is what i was looking for. There are plenty of resturants and bars nearby and i always felt safe in this part of town.The closest metro to the hotel is the Oberkampf which is roughly about 100 meters, howver the republic which is about a 5 minute walk is better to get around the city. This was my first time in Paris and i did manage to see most of the city and i thought the area in which the Plessis was in was by far a better choice and i have no doubt that when i come back i will definatley stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Friendly and good value hotel I enjoyed my stay at this hotel though intially I was a little dubious when told we had been booked into a two star hotel. The receptionists throughout the four days we stayed there were extremely approachable and helpful. The interior decor was, in my opinion, a little dated but very clean. The rooms are adequately sized and ours, being on the 5th floor, had its own bathroom and balcony. The location couldn't have been more ideal with Oberkampf metro station literally around the corner and a main metro interchange at Republique about 10 minutes away by foot. I've stayed in a couple of two star hotels in Paris and the Plessis represents very good value for money.

<Content>Good find in Paris A good hotel away from the main touristy areas of Paris. Staff were very friendly, helpful and the accomodation was a fair size. Although the bathroom in my room seemed a little dated compared to others in the hotel, the whole room very clean and comfortable offering excellent value for money.Location wise, the hotel has plenty of cafes and restuarants nearby as well as some excellent patisseries. It's between two metro stops and one metro stop down from the Gare de Nord, so for getting around public transport / in and out of Paris it was ideal.

<Content>Plusses for the Plessis! This was my first time to Paris and this hotel added to my visit being very pleasant. The room was clean, bed comfortable, and linen crisp. The bathroom smelled a bit musty but had nice fixtures, including a hair dryer. Didn't need the room fan as the weather was cool, but nice to know it was there just in case. I stayed over a weekend and Saturday night was rather noisy with other hotel guests coming in and out and into the small hours of the morning. I suppose that can happen anywhere, though. I took the inhouse breakfast most mornings and found it good value. The chocolate croissant one morning was clearly day-old and disappointing. No clock in the room, but perhaps that's standard for a 2 star hotel. The female front desk staff were helpful and friendly. A wonderful find in a great location.Canadian traveler

<Content>Liked our stay We stayed ar Plessis for a week early in May and liked it. Very friendly staff, quiet and clean room (when booking at Venere.com we asked for a room on the upper floor with windows looking to the yard - and loved the rooftops view from our 5th floor). We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, there are plenty of nice places around for it. Area is very nice. Little food market nearby is open at least until 1am. Walk to the subway stop was always safe and pleasant. The only thing that could be better - hotel's Internet connection. Though free, it was useless because it was extremely slow. We ended up finding a 24 hrs Internet chain called Milk and were happy with it. Overall - great place to stay in Paris.

<Content>Good value for money Just got back from a long weekend break to Paris.The Hotel Plessis was a very good choice and is excellentvalue for money. The reception staff are very friendly and speakgood English. There is a lift which is always a bonus and therooms are clean (some with balconys!) and the ensuites arespacious. Breakfast was a buffet. Tip....ask to have hot milkwith your coffee. Plentiful. As for the area, very nice. TypicallyParisien, not very touristy and all the better for that. Very nearto two metro lines so easy to get into the centre.All in all a very choice and would stay again next time i go toparis. Recommend as such good value for money!Julia.

<Content>Clean and Friendly liked the neighborhood Found the staff to be very friendly and all spoke fine English. Hotel rooms were small, but decent for Europe. Room was very clean with no odd smells etc.... Balcony was nice as you could sit outside Not fancy, so bring your own shampooAll in all for the great price, safe neighborhood, friendly and clean environment good choice. I only go to the hotel to sleep so no need for fancy room anyway.... Elevator is tiny so do not bring too much luggage! But you should not anyway. Lots of restaurants/stores near by, so we did not buy breakfast.Republic metro is very close and great transfer point for other lines.

<Content>Good value in paris We have just returned from a 4 nights stay at the Plessis and really like the hotel. For its class, it is excellent. A basic room and bathroom, but clean and well kept. Mostly French TV channels, but we got CNN and German AT1 as well. We had room no 540 with twin beds, and had a nice little balcony outside towards the street. (We preferred the twins, since French lit matrimonial is really narrow.) Our room had the big fan mentioned earlier, but at this time of the year we did not need it. The street itself is a small side street, so it was quite calm, once you remember that you are in a big city. They did have some repairs done to the tiny elevator one day, but it was only for a few hours, and the rest of the time it worked well. All the time the staff was most friendly, very pleased with our rather rusty French. They ordered at taxi for us to get to the airport the last day and the driver was punctual and good. We ended up paying 鈧?42 from the hotel to the CDG terminal 2 on our way back. Getting there we used the free shuttle to the RER and changed to the metro at Gare du Nord, a little more than 16鈧?for two, but walking quite a bit more.We did enjoy a Turkish restaurant, just down the street to the left with a good 鈧?7, - menu and an even better 鈧?0,- one. The creperie down on the corner is cheaper; their dinner menu was at 鈧?5 and 鈧?9,20 at lunchtime. Good food and friendly service at both places.  We had the breakfast each day, a basket with a pain au chocolate, a croissant and a bread roll pr person, with jam and butter, enough coffee and milk for 3 coffees each was brought to the table. A buffet offered orange and grapefruit juice, boiled ham, salami, hard boiled eggs, yoghurts, fromage blanc, canned fruits, prunes, apple sauce, corn flakes, zwieback, sliced cake and a few other things as well. Unless you want fresh cooked eggs and bacon, we found it a bargain at 鈧?6,50 pr person. Other cafes in the neighbourhood offered breakfast as well, but there it was the same price for one cup of beverage, one juice, one croissant and a roll.

<Content>Better places to stay The Plessis is an ok place to stay IF you are on a tight budget. Just some basics:1. Our room had a terrible cigarette odor2. The carpets had dust stains3. Bathroom smelled like feces 4. Curtains had cigarette burn holes in them5. TV only gets 9 channels (they advertise they have satellite)6. Basically no heat in the room during winter months. Room had a furnice, but it averaged about 60 degrees most of the time.7. No air conditioning8. Overall cleaniness of hotel was poor9. Tiny tiny elavator that was filthy.I realize this is an older hotel, but I was not impressed with the quality. I can accept the old part, but that is not an excuse for the filth. They really should consider painting the walls and replacing the carpeting.The service was good. They were always very friendly and they spoke English. The hotel is in a good location and is very close to the Metro, ATM, multiple restaurants, and a grocery store.

<Content>basic, but good price for stay We stayed in the Hotel Plessis on our 4 day visit to Paris. It is a pretty basic hotel, but clean and good enough for us to crash in every night after long days out sightseeing. The elevator is tiny, and they were repairing it when we checked in, so we had to lug our suitcase up 5 flights of stairs, but it was in working order the rest of our stay. I do wish the room had a clock or alarm of some kind, but that was a minor detail. The front desk staff were very nice and helpful and spoke English. The hotel is very close (2-3 min walk) to the Oberkampf metro station and there is a grocery store, 2 patisseries and a great creperie on the adjacent streets. It is a bit far from the major tourist sights, but very convenient on the metro.

<Content>Good value hotel for Paris We stayed here for 3 nights in September 2006 and found that it was good value for Paris. The room was a little small but most are, from what other reviewers say. The hotel is located in the financial district and although it is a fair distance from sights, it has good transport links via the Metro (just up the road in either direction). The restaurants nearby were a bit pricey if you are on a budget so we would suggest heading over to the Latin Quarter instead.Hotel staff were friendly and helpful and at the time we stayed there was free internet access albeit one PC.The breakfast wasn't too thrilling and we only paid for it once, deciding to venture elsewhere on the other days. Breakfast wasn't included in the room price.

<Content>a delightful experience and a great value. Plessis was much higher up in the ratings than it is now- i feel guilty not writing my review sooner. We are a late middle-aged gay couple who have visted Paris many times and one of us is fluent in French. But no matter. the staff is kind and generous. We were in the middle of an exceptional heat wave and the balcony room together with the HUGE electric fan provded without asking kept us comfortable at any time of teh day or night, with the huge balcony window open on to the street .very french and very romantic atmosphere. the room was decorated simply and cheerfully ;the breakfasts were a good value and more than adequate. free internet access, and a wonderful creperie down the street with a friendly proprieter. He owns the restaurant and lives above it and the crepes are an experience and reasonably priced. the metro republique is a stones throw:how I wish I were going tomorrow!!!!! This hotel deserved it's place in the top 10 - the congeniality of the staff , the rooms, and the location in my favorite part of Paris.i realize it is not the Champs Elysee or the Rue montaigne. We've been there. not as much fun.!!!!!!

<Content>Great value We stayed just one night between two flights (Sept 3,06). I originally chose it because it is near a metro station which is four stops away from Gare du Nord, where the train takes you to the airport. It turned out to be a great choice. Hotel staff was very nice and helpful. The room was very clean and tastefully decorated. The sorroundings where peaceful. Only thing missing was an air conditioner, which we didn't need as the night temperature was fair.

<Content>Friendly Hotel-Great Location, Cannot beat the price My fiance and I (both grad students in our 20s) truly enjoyed our stay at the Plessis hotel in June 2005. We stayed for 3 nights, then drove around Bretagne/Loire for 7 days and then ended our France vacation back at the Plessis for a night. Plessis is in a wonderful location at the Place de la Republique. There are great cafes and bakeries on the same block (Jenny's is great for alsatian food; the bakery on the corner has fantastic pain au raisins/au chocolat). There is a Monoprix down the block (perfect for picnic supplies-or anything, really). The Metro is less than a block away in either direction, making travel to and from the hotel very easy. We found the hotel owner to be quite jovial and the staff to be friendly (We speak passable French, but the staff speaks English well). The rooms are small but clean, and for the price and the location-you can't beat it--we paid less than 70 Euros/night in 2005 and were very very happy!

<Content>a nice place Stayed at this hotel while in Paris a couple of times and would highly recommend it. In a very nice location just a short walk from the metro. the staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are comfortalbe and very clean. they are not spacious but room to walk around in and have a couple of big bags. Would gladly stay at again. Try the mussel place around the corner or the crepe place on the same block.
