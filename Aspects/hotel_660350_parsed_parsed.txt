<Content>Disapointed I stayed at the hotel for two nights. On arrival i offered to pay in advance so that if anything happened my bill would be covered, they seemed to be disapointed that i was paying in cash!!! The hotel room was clean but dark because of the room location 003 if we opened our curtains we were looking out on the lobby, therefore we had no privacy and if felt like we were hiding from someone. Both nights we were in bed before midnight because we did alot during the day and had early starts in the mornings because of our room location the noise levels were really high and we found it hard to go to sleep and to sleep through the night without been woken by noise. There didnt seem to be a high level of security at the hotel and often i heard banging on doors and windows which made me insecure when going to sleep. The hotel was reasonably priced and it reflected in their service, i definately would not recommend it for older couples or a girls weekend. There was also a huge street construction going on straight at the hotel door which we were never notified about and caused alot of noise and dust.

<Content>Book with caution! The hotel is in a good location - near to La Rambla and plenty of restaurants and bars nearby - however it is a slightly rough area which could be a problem if you arrive late at night or are a group of girls.Unfortunately we were allocated a room right by the bar - with no outside window or window that could be opened or curtains drawn so it was a bit like staying in a cupboard - the room was clean with a new trendy style bathroom - but the actual room 001 was a bit scruffy and knocked about.When we requested a room change we were told by the very unhelpful reception staff no way that they were full so we had to put up with the room for 2 nights - a very unpleasant experience. IF YOU BOOK THIS HOTEL ENSURE YOU REQUEST A ROOM WITH AN OUTSIDE WINDOW.

<Content>From Hero to Zero ... terrible experience on my second visit. Never again! Having stayed here previously, and rated it a 5 out of 5, I was looking forward to my second visit. Unfortunately it was a disaster and I checked out this morning feeling angry, tired and ripped off. I have tried to be proactive by attempting via Hotels Catalonia's 'Contact Us' section of their website, to complain, but quel surprise it does not want to accept my message.I checked out of the Catalonia Avinyo this morning at 9am. The bill was some Euros 394 and I had a Euro 500 note which I wanted to pay the bill in cash with. The girl on duty said she only had 50 Euros in change and refused to get change from elsewhere to help me. I did not want to use my credit card, incurring extra FX and commission charges, when I had the cash. She claimed the barman had no money either - I do not believe this as I was kept awake by the noise from the bar. I cannot seriously believe that a hotel chain of their size would not keep an adequate sum of cash in the till. We reached a stalemate as she refused to contact anyone to help get change (when I asked to speak to the manager, she said she was on duty and therefore was the manager). She refused to deduct a small amount of Euros (I asked for a discount of 4 Euros) from my bill to compensation for the FX charges I would incur paying by Amex. She suggested I go out into the street and look for change! Knowing full well that banks were closed. I had to get a cab to the airport so unfortunately had to pay by credit card. I left feeling disgusted.I find it hard to believe this hotel would only have 50 Euros available in cash onsite, including bar takings. Is this a con to force us to use credit cards? So my first warning to travellers is to make sure if you pay in cash, you have the right change!The above changed my rating from the 3 stars I had planned to give, to 1 star (ideally I would give none).The room this time was awful. Room 101 (literally). The first floor is actually a mezzanine, so opens down below to the lobby and bar area. This means it's very noisy. There was no window, just a window that gave on to the corridor. Pointless, as to ensure privacy you had to pull those curtains to stop passers by looking in. For Euros 150 it was not worth it. The noise from the bar kept me awake most nights until around 1am. This morning however, I was woken at 430am this morning by loud talking, followed by screaming and shouting from the reception area. This continued until 6am. I was too frightened to go down and investigate/complain as the shouts were very threatening. When I raised this issue on checking out, the duty manager stated it was noisy people outside the hotel. I do not believe this as I clearly heard them in the reception area taking cans from the vending machine and in any case, should the external doors not have been be closed at that hour of the morning, to ensure the security of guests? Finally, 2 Euros for minibar - not used - was added to my bill and in my distress this morning (lack of sleep plus the discussion about the change) I did not spot this until I had left.This was my 2nd visit to the Avinyo, and my last. The location is great, but there are lots of hostels and pensiones in the same area that I am sure could offer a clean room at half the price.If you do stay here, avoid rooms on the 1st floor as there is no protection from the noise, both from the bar and lobby, and any users of the internet. Room 101 is actually the room closest to the outside area, so that in particular should be avoided.

<Content>Think again... Clean but very small... Lovely staff but don't know much about their own area so you have to figure places out for yourself... Jacuzzi bigger than swimming pool! Any fans of stargate - hotel room corridors are similar to the base! Same colour throughout all the floors with huge numbers printed on the doors... Rooms are tiny. Be careful also who you book with as we booked with an online agency and our 'secure' credit details were on show!

<Content>Excellent location This hotel is the best for location. it is just off Las Rambles. 20 min walk to beach south and 20 mins walk to where the bus drops you off from airport north. There are loads of irish bars within a few minutes. The clubbing area is in Port Olympic which is about 30 min walk away but to be honest we found the bars open until 4am which is late enough cos there is so much sight seeing to do during the day. The hotel is basic and clean with nice breakfast. However, the room we had had a window overlooking the dark corridor (that did not open). It had Air con but not sufficient. We had ours on 24/7 and it was still hot and stuffy in there. The bathroom had no ventilation. A taxi from the airport cost 50 euros while the Aerobus cos 4 euros each!!!! It's the A1 bus right outside the airport. We were very careful with our belongings and had no problem at all and late at night use to walk the long way home (about 5 minutes instead of 2), so just use your head and keep your wits about you. Enjoy.

<Content>Mixed review Location of the hotel is fantastic - just a few minutes walk to Las Ramblas and the port, surrounded by loads of restaurant options and shops. The pool on the roof is also great - not large, but perfect for cooling off at the end of the day, and grabbing a few rays during the day.Unfortunately a few things let down the experience.... I had booked a double room, and was told that they had overbooked and I would have to take a single room - not a good outcome at the best of time, but worst when you've just had a break-up! With a lot of pushing they offered a free beakfast as compensation for the price difference, and the offer to move to a double room the next day. The room they gave me had no external windows, and looked over the internal closed in courtyard. When I was moved to a new room on the second day, although a double, the only window actually overlooked the hallway. So no natural light in my rooms for the 2 day stay - felt like a bit of a dungeon! This seemed to apply to all the rooms on the ground and first floors. Although it seems that rooms above this level do have windows to the outside world. The rooms were new and styled nicely, but very small, even the double. I wouldnt stay there again unless I could be guaranteed a room with a proper window.

<Content>Nice weather, however..... Although we had read reviews on this hotel they were mixed so we thought we would go for it.Best things about this hotel:Location - centralRoof Terrace - Well presented, reasonable size, free ice...Not so best things:Breakfast - don麓t bother (nothing was hot except the toast which you make fresh)Room - no window to the outside takes time to get used to (not for the clostrophobics). Rooms not sound proof as stated in hotel blurb!  Previously been to Barcelona and enjoyed our stays, would not stay at this hotel again though.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Just had 4 days in barcelona and stayed at the Catalonia Avinyo just off the Ramblas. Read the reviews and was'nt sure about booking this hotel. This surely was'nt the same hotel trippers were griping about. But we booked it and were not dissapointed. Staff were very polite, rooms were clean and adequate with a free safe and a well stocked mini bar. breakfast was a treat with plenty of choice, also a nice roof terrace with good sunbeds and table and chairs. We went with another couple and they agreed with us, 10/10.

<Content>Perfect Location I was pessimistic before arriving at Hotel Avinyo due to negative reports I had read.I found it to be a very functional and extremely central location.The rooms are small but ours were clean, we had plenty hot water, they were dark, (fantastic) and no traffic or outside noise distractions, so sleep wasn't a problem.The breakfast wasn't great but we had enough to eat none the less. Everything was cold but we were always the end of the queue anyway!Staff were pleasant not overfriendly but had no problems with them. The hotel itself is like an upgraded hostel, its void of atmosphere but basic and functional. The bar is usually empty, restaurant tables that are never used (we guessed they are for ornamental purposes).There if free internet (3 laptops) a big plus for teenagers, and we had one in our group, so big thumbs up to that.Overall, I would recommend the Hotel to others, like all holidays, we used it little, just for a base and the location in perfect, action on the doorstep and thats what makes a holiday!

<Content>good value.... My brother in law and I stayed here last week.We were over to see the football.The hotel room was dark, but who cares.It was clean and lets be honest ,you ain't paying 5Star are you?It was handy for the Ramblas, the beach and the Cathedral.I have read reviews saying the front counter staff wern't so good.It must have been a different set of guys we met.They went out of their way to get us a map and mark out which subway we should use,the porter also offered to get us tickets for the game.(we already had some).We never made breakfast but there are sandwich shops etc. nearby.All in all a good choice

<Content>Watch out at the Avinyo This hotel is in a good location and is newly opened this year. However, we discovered bed bugs in the room. We caught several live ones but the management barely reacted. They did not even apologise when we pointed out that having spotted several bugs scurrying aound on the bed meant that we had barely had any sleep. (The boy on the front desk overnight had said he could not do anything and we would have to wait for the manager to arrive the next morning.) When the manager finally arrived he didn't even give us a cursory nod; instead he inspected the live creatures we had caught in a glass then went about his business. Once we had discovered the bugs we realised that the spots of blood we had presumed to be dead mosquitos could have easily been flattened bedbugs. Since the management did not react to our discovery we can assume that it was a problem they were alrerady aware of; one which they had done nothing to remedy.The whole discovery spolit what could have been a great holiday.

<Content>very much worth it! I disagree with many people complaining about this hotel. For 3 stars you get much: the room is clean and -i think- normal size. Although kind of dark. But so what? I don't travel to Barcelona to spend my holiday in a hotel room. At night it is only good that it is dark. Bathroom was spacious and two people can easily share.Also Breakfast was good; eggs, bacon, sausages, bread, croissants, different kinds of cereal, yoghurt, juices, coffee, hot cocoa, fruits.... Very good for a hotel in this category.The pool was small, true, but not too cold, average. And a pool is more than you can require for a 3 star city centre hotel!About the staff I have my say too... They were not rude (at least not the man at Breakfast) but not too friendly either. If you ask, they will answer, but nothing else. There are no extra smiles or anything... And like everyone say: THE LOCATION IS TO DIE FOR!

<Content>Good Location This hotel is all about the location. It's 1 minute walk to La Rambla, and 15 mins walk to the beach, in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. Because it's a new hotel, it's very clean and modern, and it's got a small rooftop pool and jacuzzi. But this is where the positive points ends.The rooms at the hotel are TINY, especially if you are 3 people sharing a room, and most of them don't have any natural light. The bathrooms are also very small and impossible for 2 people to share at the same time. The staff are very rude and you feel like they might kill you if you ask for anything out of the ordinary. There is a guard looking at you while you eat breakfast to make sure you don't steal the cutlery, and the breakfast only has white bread and some cold eggs and sausages. The rooftop does not have anything but a pool and jacuzzi, no chairs, tables, nothing. In addition the water is FREEZING cold!All in all this is a good hotel for the location, but if you end up paying more than 100 EUR a night for a double room it's not worth it.

<Content>Good location The hotel had only been opened for 1.5 month when I stayed there. The room is minimal with no daylight coming in from the window, but clean and functional. Furnishing minimalistic, bordering to boring. When going back to the hotel on my first day, I found the font-desk guy sitting on my bed while some workers were busy setting up a shelf system for hanging clothes in the room. No apology, same guy didn't even look up when answering me on the same morning when I came down and asked where breakfast was serverd. Breakfast ok, but tiny canteen trays, so things like the scrambled eggs run out all the time and you had to sit and wait for them to fill be filled up. Sun deck without chairs or beds which is really a pity. Small but ok pool, and a jaccuzzi. Greatest advantage is the location in Barri Gotic, only about 300 m from Rambla and metro-station Liceu.

<Content>I do not recommend I am a single young woman from Scandinavia and I spent 5 nights at Hotel Avinyo in Barcelona. My expectations were high: brand new hotel, not cheap, swimming pool and jacuzzi at the top terrace, excellent location...It really was disappointing, I would not recommend this hotel to anybody. Few details: - no hot water during 50% of my visit - I was forced to change the room instantly when I arrived to this hotel, there was no window (except to the corridor) and the size of the whole room was smaller than most of the hotel bathrooms elsewhere...- only interior rooms available (when I changed the room)- they put me to a family room and booked the connecting room to a total stranger who tried to open the door by breating the door at 2am- very dark rooms- no chairs or sun beds at the terrace- you could not use the sun terrace at all, there were workmen hammering and drilling from 10am to 6pm - no water in the jacuzzi- the cleaning was really bad, nobody wiped the floor during my whole stay and once after the cleaning there were no towels in the room. They did not empty the trash bins every day- no window in the breakfast room- no fresh coffee, just a machine- no refunds (and I had paid the whole price in advance)+ excellent location+ quiet+ friendly staff, unfortunately they were not able to help with any of the issues mentioned above... I hope somebody else has better luck with hotel Avinyo :)

<Content>Disappointing for a new hotel We stayed for 11 nights and up to the last couple of days I had to keep asking for fresh towels and our room to be serviced. I got to the stage of sticking a note on the bedroom door to remind the cleaning staff our room was free for servicing. In 11 nights the floor was not swept or washed once!!! - i took to wiping the floor in the bathroom and around the bed with some cloths i bought for the purpose. Beds are extremely hard and uncomfortable and air conditioning not great. Staff rarely spoke to us when entering or leaving the hotel on any day . The bar was not open during our whole stay (even though the web site claimed the hotel had a bar) the reception area although it had multiple futon like chairs was not relaxing to sit in. The corridors looked like a prison and were dark and depressing. The roof top pool was very small and there were no chairs or loungers to sit on so you just sat on a towel on the decking - not very comfortable. I would have checked out after 2 days and looked for somewhere else if we hadn't paid the full price up front - I didn't relish the thought of trying to get a refund from unfriendly staff - or staff who spoke poor English

<Content>Book Somewhere Else I would not recommend this hotel - we had a few bad experiences, a couple of the staff where unhelpful. The airconditioning was not great and the room was very stuffy as it had no fresh air getting into the room. There booking details where not correct and tried to charge us over 100 euros when we went to checktout of the hotel.(double check your booking when you check in, we were lucky the girl that checked us in stood by our statement) Definity a cheap hotel but worth while to spend that extra pound. Good location though.

<Content>Great location, minimum of everything else Saving grace is the excellent position BUT...... You do not get value for your money in Barcelona. For the price I expected some type of luxury. Mmmm. Yeah, right! Rooms very small and dark. Absolute minimum in furnishings and comfort. Hard beds and when we were there they were still completeing building. This also meant that there were no blankets available for those who want them in the airconditioning.Breakfast - fine, and reasonable choice.Minimialistic to the extreme in furnishings. If you can afford it, ask for a room for 3 even if you are only 2 as you will get a front room with more light and more space!It realy is 200 m. from the Ramblas and the action. The Gothic area is the place to be. You cannot beat it for location! Luckly I enjoyed Barcelona so much that during the day I forgot my backache from the beds!The rooftop pool is about as big as 2 double beds so don;t bank on doing laps there!

<Content>Teething Problems This hotel had been open only 8 days when we checked in. In my opinion it opened too early.Our bedroom was very dark and had no window to the outside, there wasa window to the inside of the hotel with wire mesh outside, I felt itwas like a prison cell! I would recommend asking for a room with a window to the outside.Rooms are very small and basic. They are very dark and ours had no natural light. Behind the bed is a black and white mural of an aircraft and for some reason in such dark rooms the curtains are black and the bedding grey, all very depressing. Also the bed was small and very uncomfortable.The bathroom had only a shower, however they were bright with blue tiles and and the shower was excellent. they were no amenities on thefirst day but the second day we had soap, shampoo and shower gel.The bar was not yet opened and a lot of the rooms are still being fitted out.Breakfast was included: Juice, scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon. Also croissants, toast, fresh fruit and a coffee machine. The breakfast room also has no window and no music playing - not a great atmosphere.There is a small rooftop pool and jacuzzi which was open but there were alot of workmen around finishing work so we gave it a miss.The location of this hotel is superb with fabulous restaurants and bars as well as shops around. Very close to the Ramblas although we felt unsafe there and tried to avoid it. One of our friends was robbed on our last night on the Ramblas and this seemed a common occurrance.I would definately recommend this hotel for location, however the decor of the room and the incredibly hard beds makes it an unsuitablechoice for myself.
