<Content>What a find! I stayed here for just one night, but I was most impressed by the location, staff and room. The room was basic, but had everything you could need, including safe and refrigerator. Free internet access is available in the lobby. Next time I'm in Sydney, I'll definitely return to Sullivans.

<Content>Value for Money. Neither flash nor fancy but impeccably clean with good sized , functional rooms, comfortable beds and friendly, helpful staff.Excellent location just a short bus ride from the centre of Sydney.Frequent bus service into the city and Circular Quay from bus stop just along the pavement from the hotel and to Bondi from the stop just across the road.To the left, outside the hotel, is the busy end of Oxford Street with numerous ethnic restaurants, cafes etc. and, at weekends, thronged with young revellers - tho. not a drunk in sight! Sullivans is at the quieter end with, opposite and to the right, upmarket boutiques and, on Saturdays, the openair Paddington Market just a short walk away.Friendly pub next door and if you want a good meal at a modest price try the RSL Paddo just up the road, on the opposite side, past the Barracks - the equivalent in purpose, I suppose, of a British Legion Club. Visitors welcome. Nothing fancy but a very good selection on the menu - meat, pasta, fish etc. with prices ranging from less than 拢4 for one of the pastas to just over 拢6 for a T bone steak or a really good fish meal!!! Try it - you won't be sorry.Staff at Sullivans are friendly and helpful and particular mention must be made of Madelaine, on the front desk, and Mark, the Manager. Mark proved to be fantastic source of advice on where to go; what to see; how to get there and which of the various bus/ferry ticket options would save us money. Thanks to his directions and advice we saved not only cash but time and our travels round and about were effortless.We would certainly use Sullivans again.

<Content>Consistently good This was not the first time we have stayed here, it's still one of the best places to stay in Sydney...always nice to find that things haven't changed (for the worst) The front desk staff made us feel very welcome and as returning guests they even upgraded our room ( which considering we booked through a last minute booking agency was generous) The back part of the hotel is definitely the quietest, also we like the fact that we can hear the birds in neighboring houses in the morning. It is so easy to reach the centre of the city from here that I cannot imagine why anyone would want to stay any closer. We love the walks around the area, and esp going down the hill to the Liverpool st Bill's Cafe (Bill Granger) for brekky. One really nice touch is that the hotel provides guests with a good overview of things to do places to eat in the room info file, this is a great touch and much appreciated. Try dinner at Fish Face!

<Content>Excellent choice My wife and I recently stayed here and I can really recommend this hotel. The staff are very friendly,the roomwas small but very suitable andthe location is superb. As a senior lecturer in travel and tourism at AUT University Auckland I am inclined to be a little critical but my wife and I would definitely stay here again

<Content>Couldn't Have Had a Better Stay My wife and I recently stayed at Sullivans in Sydney for nine days and I would have to say it was the most enjoyable stay we have had at any hotel for quite some time. The location in Paddington is excellent. Buses come by frequently both east to the lovely beaches or west to downtown and points outward. Lovely coffee shop across the way, excellent bookstore right by the hotel and a Irish pub a short walk east.Most of all, though, the staff are excellent. The two main fellows at the desk downstairs were like personal friends to us over the course of our stay. They recommended weekly bus passes which saved us lots of money on travel and were always very helpful with directions and bus routes.Rooms at the hotel are cosy. I have to also add I never heard any noise from the hallways or from the floor above, which is always nice when one wants to get some rest. Did not do the pool or rent the bikes but they are available at no extra cost. One computer with free internet and that was usually available so no need to visit an internet cafe (nice to save a bit there as well). Loved staying at Sullivans and could not more highly recommend the hotel!!

<Content>Conveniently located. I feel a bit mean only giving it a 2 rating but i was quite disappointed. We had a room on the side of the building, across the street from some houses. A typical set up for a city hotel I am sure.The room was...small. It was pretty well impossible not to trip over your bag on the way to the miniscule bathroom. You wouldn't want to be clostrophobic!The bed was fairly comfortable but the pillows were ROCK hard.Bring your own shampoo, etc. as there are NO bathroom complimentaries. Only one towel per person and no floor matt. There is a tea/coffee service but no raw sugar. Later that night as the cold settled in I went downstairs to ask for another blanket. The staff were amused at my request . The look they gave each other seemed to say we're not one of those kinds of hotels. I was instead instructed to use the air conditioning which was ridiculous as I wouldn't like to sleep with it on all night. We piled our winter coats on the bed for warmth instead.The 'sleeping' part of the hotel is attached to the original Sullivans Hotel (pub section). We went there for dinner and were VERY HAPPY! The service was absolutely fantastic, the food was fresh and tasty AND reasonably priced (we had the bean nachos and the salt and pepper squid which came with a yummy salad). One thing that MUST be said about the Sullivans hotel is that it is in an EXCELLENT location. You can't beat it for the price (though not cheap, fairly cheap for Sydney). The rooms are clean and it is great not to have to share a bathroom.Go to the Sullivans hotel for dinner and a beer and a city-sleep ;)

<Content>Bit Disappointed..... Feel a bit mean only giving it a 2 rating but i was quite disappointed. We had 2 room on the side of the building, maybe if we'd had one of the internal rooms overlooking the garden it may have been better. The rooms we had looked very tired. The bed was comfortable and the bedding was spotless but the windows looked old and the curtains were really shabby. the nets were gray and in one room there was a horrible yellow stain on them. There's really no excuse for that, it doesnt cost a lot to put clean nets up. We could hear the noise of the traffic, I think it was only single glazing. The bathroom was adequate and clean but again, dated. The pool is freezing because it's solar heated, which doesnt mean solar panel heated, just solar heated, sadly it is built in the shade apart from a few hours sun in the morning so that pool will never be warm. The blue paint has been eroded by the chemicals and comes off on your body! We told the staff and they closed the pool, yet another disappointment. I dont think it's great value for money as it wasnt THAT cheap and i wish we'd paid a few hundred more quid for a better experience. Gladly we were only there 4 nights. It wasnt awful but it wasnt great either. We ate breakfast at Alexandras opposite the park just a quick bus ride away. Another fab place to eat breakfast is past alexandras opposite the Shark Hotel at a place called K.K's they served delicious breakfasts including luxury muslis with homemade exotic yoghurts and fresh fruit as well as an abundance of baked goods for a fraction of what it costs to eat at the hotel. We also bought the week long orange travel pass that allows you to use the buses and the ferries as often as you wish. This worked out to be a great money saver, we certainly got our money's worth. I'd recommend forgetting about the explorer buses as they cost loads and just using the ordinary transport system on an orange saver card.

<Content>Great stay! We stayed 3 nights on our way home from NZ. After staying in budget hotels in NZ, this was a step up. Our room was small but clean  in good order, not at all shabby. The A/C worked well and we needed it as it was quite warm. Our garden room looked over the small pool and a lovely small garden  fountain. Very pleasant  quiet. No street noise at all. The bathroom was clean. They are a bit stingy with towels - no wash clothes or hand towels only one bath towel per person  a shower soap dispenser. Bring your own shampoo, etc. as there are no complimentaries. There is a tea/coffee service with a small chocolate candy. There is a small frig. but don't ask for extra ice as there is no ice maker. The 380 bus leaves from the hotel door going to Bondi Beach or town. We walked in  out of town as we are walkers but it might be a trek for those who aren't. There are several good restaurants  pubs in the area  the hotel provides an excellent guide to them in each room. Going into Paddington there are loads of stylish boutiques. Walking into town, one goes past a couple of strip clubs, fetish shops  through Taylor Sq. known for its gay population. During the day, the area feels safe but we refrained from being out too late in the area. We suspect there is a reason the doors are locked after hours. As to the reception, there were a number of different men there during our stay. One in particular was a friendly, no nonsense person while the others did seem to ignore us as we came and left. However, when a couple of unusual fellows came in off the street and started to walk upstairs, they were called back and questioned. I believe reception contacted whomever they were looking for and had them come down. At 15$ for a continental breakfast, we did not have breakfast there but found cheaper breakfasts elsewhere or just had excellent large, flat whites  huge raisin toasts for $5 at the stand outside the Marriot across from Hyde Park. Sullivan's Hotel's webpage clearly  accurately depicts the hotel.

<Content>Nice budget hotel A little bit tired looking but or room was at the end of a corridor so nice and quiet. We picked this hotel because they were in a good location for mardis gras and relatively inexpensive.

<Content>Poor Service The location is nice, on a major bus route easy access to downtown. The staff however is another issue. Most were not friendly at all. The night time staff would not even speak or acknowledge your presence. The reason you have to inter act with then is you need to be buzzed in, because of thier key system. Also one wonders about security as the same night staff seemed as if they would give you any any key you asked for. I would not stay on a return to Sydney, have found much nicer staff else where.

<Content>Great location, friendly staff I stayed here for 10 nights in December and found the hotel to be excellent. The staff at reception were incredibly knowledgeable and friendly.Paddington reminded me a little of Notting Hill, London, with plenty of cool bars and boutique shops. Personally I found staying out of the centre refreshing and thought I saw more of the 'real Sydney'.The best thing about the hotel was the free muffins and fruit provided every day at reception. The free DVD rental and Internet access was also a bonus.My only grumble would be that the swimming pool was freezing (though the weather wasn't great while we were there).

<Content>Loved Sullivans Great location for exploring Sydney and surrounding area - very convenient to buses and great for walking - easy  quick access to town, ferries and Bondi and other southern beaches in the other direction.Very friendly and helpful staff. Appreciated the free internet access as well as the laundry facilities.Rooms were simple and clean - more than adequate for our use - we were not spending the day in the room while in Sydney.We appreciated the pool after a hot day of exploring Sydney.

<Content>Satisfying Stay We stayed 2 nights at Sullivans on a precruise visit to Sydney. The hotel was clean and the staff was very helpful. There is a bus stop just a block up and the public transportation into the CBD is very good. The continental breakfast is $14.90. It was a bit of a surprise since we get it free usually in the USA. We would stay there again.

<Content>Perfect Location in Paddington We arrived at Sullivans by Taxi from the airport charge $40 AUD. Taxi driver was very informative. We had arrived short of a suit case and a stolen cam corder but were determined not to let this deter from our holiday. The hotel staff were very helpful, allowing us into our room early. The room was not too large but we were only stopping a couple of nights. The reception staff were very helpful regarding our luggage and guided us to how to get the best of the short time we were in Sydney.I would definitely recommend position, quite a busy nightlife and plenty of boutique shops nearby. Just a short bus trip into the city and we had a couple of early morning strolls into centennial park.

<Content>Smelly room Pros: Good location, free parking, very friendly reception staff who gave us lots of tips and advice on public transport and was very helpful with all questions we had.Cons: Our room (it was room 113, so you can avoid it) stank of urine; it got a little better once we activated ventilation and the air conditioner, but a/c is automatically switched off once you leave the room so it does not help much. The room was very small as well and it was not perfectly clean. There was rubbish left from a previous guest in the trash bin.There is free internet access from a computer in the lobby, but it was almost always occupied since there is only one for such a big hotel. For Sydney, it is however probably one of the hotels with reasonable prices.One last advice would be to avoid the airport shuttle which the hotel can book for you. When we were picked up, we were driven to another hotel and had to wait there for another vehicle for quite a time. It took much longer than we were told.

<Content>Well located, clean, simple, does the job For Sydney this is a great value. Well located but not smack downtown. You can walk to the Museum subway station in 10 minutes, but through interesting shops and the glbt neighbourhood which is always entertaining. I would definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to others.Tip: quicker route to subway or to Bondi Beach is to buy bus tickets at any of the numerous convenience stores around the city. Transit system is straightforward.Take the ferry from Circular Quay over to Manley (Leaves from Pier 3). Best views of Sydney Harbour

<Content>Does the job! It's on Oxford Street between Darlinghurst and Paddington - a great area to be so 10 out of 10 for location. Bus to city at the door OR just walk, its 25 mins downhill. Day time staff are fantastic however they have night staff who are kinda not engaged in their jobs. Maybe they hate it because it's night and they're tired I dunno, just VERY different service offerings. The good things are the location, free internet (wireless) and the feeling of security. Oxford Street has become quite sketchy and you have to watch out for yourself these days. Lots of drunk people on a Saturday night and more drunk bums than San Fran per sq metre I feel. The only think I have to give them feed back on re security is that they don't check your identity when you ask for a key. I walked in, asked for room 212 key and they gave it to me. Things I disliked about the hotel are : shower (it's a water consumption head) so you have to dance around to even get slightly wet. The rooms are a bit dated but still functional. Just a bit tired looking. I would stay here again for sure. It was $124 for a twin per night over a weekend so a great rate. The staff even booked our airport bus transfer and helped us with our bags. Give this place a chance, especially if you are not spending any great amount of time in your room.

<Content>Nice little hotel This great little find is in a neighborhood with many coffee houses, restaurants and shops. The buses stop very near the hotel to go either downtown to the Quays or out to the beaches.The personnel was very friendly, especially Dan, who gave us good advice on where to eat.The rooms are on the small side and have no frills, our bathroom was new with plenty of hot water. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Good Value  Stayed here for a week while on business in Sydney. It's pretty basic but very comfortable. Room was OK and bed was comfortable. Nice internal courtyard  pool. It has laundry and internet facilities (get there early). No wireless access, however. Staff are friendly. Breakfast room is clean  food is OK. Located on a busy road which is near trendy Paddington area with great shops and restaurants - probably the best feature of this hotel. It is on a bus route which will take you directly into the City Centre (10 mins) or to Bondi (25 minutes). Would recommend Sullivans if you are on a budget and don't want to stay right in the centre of town.

<Content>In the heart of Sydney A wonderful location in Paddington - lots of interesting shops, next door to a new/2nd hand bookshop that stays open until midnight. Just outside is a bus stop with frequent buses to Circular Quay and Bondi Beach, and several places to eat, a 7-11 etc.Friendly staff, let us into our room early (10am), clean, comfortable room with a mini-fridge and a safe. It wasn't the weather for the pool, but it looked great. Free internet access from the terminal in reception and a useful laundry room.Excellent value for money for Sydney - a short walk from the Saturday Paddington market.

<Content>Great Hotel This was a great hotel, with exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. They made us feel very welcome from start to finish. Rooms were very clean and tidy, and the maid always left us little chocolates on our pillow each nite!! Free internet access was very useful, and they had a laundry room and a lovely little pool and decking area. The hotel is situated ideally at one end of Oxford street, so you have all the attractions just a short walk away, but cannot hear the hustle and bustle. Would definately recommmend this hotel to others and would certainly stay there again!!

<Content>Value for money Booked with the hotel directly after reading reviews. They communicated effectively through emails. We decided on the hotel not knowing anything about Sydney and found it to be good value for money. We walked to the CBD a couple of times and caught the bus which was cheap and regular other times. Not much going on locally but the CBD is very close. Initial room was on the main road and found it to be very noisy, but was quickly changed to a room at the back which was very quiet.Good internet access avaiable which is free. Rooms serviced daily and they wait if you are having a lay in.Reception staff are helpful and polite.We did all the usual things whilst in Sydney, Bridge walk, Sky Tower, Bondi  Manly beaches, Blue Mountains, Hunter Valley - all very worth while and interesting and the 5 of us had a great time.Would recomment this hotel for anyone looking for value for money and pleasant service.

<Content>Nice touches This hotel is really good value for money for Sydney. Great location, nice little (outdoor) swimming pool and friendly helpful staff. Nice to have free movies, free internet, good insiders local info guide in room. Only gripe is that room was not cleaned so thoroughly 1 day (we stayed 4), but would nonetheless highly recommend this hotel

<Content>Great location but not the best place we've stayed in Initial disappointment when we were given keys to a room that stank of smoke but were given another room as soon as we informed them of this. Very helpful staff. Great location. Easy to walk into city and SCG. Lots of good restaurants around. Limited facilities in room but functional. Pool nice especially in morning when sun was on it. Handy free underground carparking as restricted parking outside.
