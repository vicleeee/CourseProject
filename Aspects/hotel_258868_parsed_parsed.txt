<Content>Fancy neighbours but a wee bit off We found the hotel, clean, friendly staff and with comfy beds and nice breakfast. Was handy that the bus stop downtown was just outside the door, since it was quite a bit from La Rambla and the rest of the hardcore tourist places. Also easy to find places around the corner for most of the stuff that u might need. The room we got was also quiet but the AC seemed wacked , no chill just warmth. But that didnt matter since we got there so early in the summer.

<Content>A Good Base to See the City I stayed at the Covadonga for 4 nights from Monday 14th April 2008 .I had booked the hotel through the Airmiles website having first read the reviews on Tripadvisor .The hotel is situated on the Av .Diagonal one of the main and busy streets in Barcelona .A taxi ride from the airport takes about 20 mins and cost 23 euros .I was travelling with my brother and 82 year old mother .Check in was a breeze and the rooms on the forth floor seemed fine .I went my Mothers room the next morning and it smelt very badly of blocked drains .The hotel staff were great and we moved her to a bigger room on the 7th floor .The breakfast buffet was above average with a very good choice of cold meats ,fruit and pastries .There was hot food on request .Because of my Mother`s age we did not use the Metro or the buses ,all of which had stops very close to the door .Nothing is too far in Barcelona .Placa de Catalunia is a 5 min taxi ride away and would probably only take 30 mins to walk .I have visited Barcelona many times and it has a reputation for pickpockets .It was good to see a strong police presence in the busy areas like the Ramblas. It feels like a very safe city ,and as everwhere just take care .The Covadonga is a good quality 3 star hotel and everything you need for a short break .I have only one complaint .Most hotels have room safes where you put in your own code ,not here .If you want to use the safe you have to go to reception to get a key at 4.6 Euros a day so with tax the safe cost 20 Euros for 4 days , a bit underhand in this day and age .That said I would use it again next time I visit this very fine city.

<Content>Pity they don't put on air conditioning until May Do not stay in single rooms numbered 214, 314, 414, 514, 614, or 714. A few days ago I stayed here and itthe room was so hot it was impossible to sleep. They said they did not put on the air conditioning until May. Three of us had three of these single rooms and luckily they changed us after the first night when we got very little sleep.

<Content>Cheap and cheerful!! Good value. We were a group of 18 staying 2 nights for a hen party. Mixed ages, 18-55! So it was quite difficult to find somewhere we could all stay together. We had six triple rooms. Obviously we wanted to keep costs low, but didnt want a complete dive, and this suited our budget. I feel we got good value for money.First impressions were really good. The location on Av Diagonale is a busy road and hotel frontage and reception area is lovely. The staff seemed well prepared, friendly and made check in for us all very easy. Lifts to all floors.The rooms had quite a large bathroom with bath and integral shower, large sink area with lots of room for us to put our toiletries/make-up. Towels provided. One of those ropey hair driers(took own!) We had three single beds, quite close to each other but absolutely fine for what we needed and whole room was extremely clean. I was lucky in my room and had a balcony with lovely view but some of the others had a window which just overlooked inner walls etc. But we did not really care about this. Was nice for us to be able to open our balcony door tho' for fresh air.Breakfast was included for us and after our first night out we just made it before the end of session!! So it was quite busy with it being a weekend. There was still plenty to go round, and although it was continental there was different things to choose from. (In a hotel in Madrid once all we got was coffee and cake bar things!) We had a variety of breads and spreads to choose from. Toast. Cereals. Ham, cheese, yogurts, choice of juices and coffee or choice of t bags. Was enough to set us up for the day.There is a big 'El Cortes Ingles' department store opposite which all have mini supermarkets in the basement floor so you would be able to buy provisions from there if necessary.There was also a star bucks and other foody places and a news stand just round the corner. We were really keen to do open top bus tour as only there for a short time and the bus stop for this was just round the corner too which was great! The best one has 3 routes and you can go on all three with your day-ticket. The best two which are 2 hours each (red and blue line) crossed over at this point too!We had been slightly concerned about location as Ramblas hotels of decent enough standard were either fully booked or too pricey. We were out a bit (needed short taxi ride 6-10E to Ramblas) 10-15E to port night out. Having been there you realise its not a city you can see on foot. You will need to use buses or metro at some point to be able to see what you want to see. It's huge! So any location would have been far from something.I would stay there again. Need to go back and explore properly. Loads to see. If you after a good night out- we went to port area on Fri night which is much safer/easier if you dressed up for a hen party etc. Ramblas area would have been harder work with a big group. Ended up at a club attached to Casino complex called 'Catwalk', cos some guys from Manchester had recommended it. This was fantastic! 18 euro to get in but well worth it. Obviously we had had a few by then, but there was a really big ground floor with normal clubby music and upper floor was totally cool r and b and hip hop,-my fave- old and new, totally packed, nicely done out. My feet were killing by the end. Think it was open til 6 or 7!! We made it til about half 4. They start much later there. We didnt have to queue at about half one-2 ish but it was really busy inside. I'd deffo go there again.Great weekend. Hotel could not have been better for us. I just wanna go back to see more now!!

<Content>Good Value Thought this hotel was quite good value for money. We got a 2 day travel card for 10euros each which meant we could use buses trams and underground. Breakfast was ok. The beds are a bit hard and the only english channel on the TV was CNN, but Iall in all I was pleased with this hotel.

<Content>lovely architecture, great location for everything! Really enjoyed the experience staying at this exceptionally situated property. Hotel is located on the very fashionable Ave. Diagonal - with great shopping, restaurants and convenient to all major tourist sights. Rooms are quite nice, with soothing earth-tones, and nice modern bathrooms. Lobby and common areas are very impressive and staff is first rate. Breakfast was quite good too. Overall, I would return to the Covadonga in a heartbeat.

<Content>Bus stop on the doorstep Spent one night in this hotel after a 7-nt apartment stay, as we couldn't have an 8th night there, so the hotel was booked for us by the letting agent. However, it turned out to be a good choice. Very positive first impression in foyer, and staff very friendly and helpful. Room on 5th floor, decent size, good bathroom, plenty of towels, toiletries etc., very clean. No balcony, and at the back of the hotel, so quiet, but not very exciting view - ok for one night, but not so great for a week.Cost - 100 euros per night, room only. Didn't investigate breakfast, as took it out in a cafe - usually a better option with continental hotels.Location- on busy Av Diagonal. Residential and shopping area, quite classy. Bus stop right outside the door, and choice of several, plus others about 2 minutes away. The nearest metro was about 10 mins walk, downhill (but up on the return !), and not on a very good line for getting to most of the major sites - you needed to change for most things. However, the bus service is excellent, and if you avail yourself of a route map from the tourist office/ info kiosks it is very easy to follow, and much more flexible than the Bus Touristic, which many people recommend. especially if you fancy doing things that aren't necessarily touristy. Buy a Barcelona Card - online, or from the tourist office - which is excellent value, as it gives you unlimited use of the metro/bus, plus free or discounted entries to numerous museums/attractions/restaurants etc. for between 2-5 days.The big dept store El Corte Ingles has a branch right across the road, and lots of other shopping opportunities nearby.If you want to spend all your time in and around Las Ramblas/the beach/old town, then it's not very handy.

<Content>Nice Hotel Close to Shops, A Bit Far from La Rambla......... Just back from a 3 day trip to Barcelona. We got a cheap-ish deal staying in the Hotel Covadonga situated on the Av Diagonal.The Hotel was sold to us as being in the heart of the city well i would say more the left shoulder!!. From the airport a Taxi took us 25-30 Mins to reach the hotel at a cost of about 21Euros. First impressions of the hotel were nice building and clean. Staff were helpful on booking in. Tried to get a room with a balcony but was unsucessful. So we ended up in a room on the 8TH(TOP) floor. Pleasent room clen and tidy on a par with Travel Lodge in UK. The air con had seen better days and at top whack it still left the room feeling stuffy. The view from the window -well no view!!we were looking onto three walls. So out and about we went to get our bearings of the city. The hotel provide Maps leaflets for places to visit, On walking onto the AV Diagonal first impressions are a busy main road flanked by shops each side. Walking down it is soon clear that the street is a shoppers heaven clothe shops line the road, every designer you can think of has an outlet. A 15-20 Min walk got us to the PG Gracia the main street that eventually leads down to the Las Rambla (Gothic Quarter).Again every shop under the sun, I would recommend going off the main street to side streets to get a drink or something to eat, Better service not as busy. The top tip for travelling aroung the city is to buy a ticket for the open top Bus the Bus Turistic it cost us 21E each for a two day ticket. This allows you to travel as much as you like over the 2 day period. You can get on and off as many times as you like. There are 3 routes being red blue and green, Taking you to the north centre and south of the city. You buy the ticket on board the bus, there are numerous bus stops littered about the city. The q for the busses can be if you try to get on at the start of the route, so get on at a stop away from the main stops.Overall it was a nice city brake with lots to see and do. I would recommend if you want to be close to Gothic Quarter and las Ramblas, Harbour to avoid the Covadonga and aim for a more central Hotel.If you do stay in the hotel be prepared for a good 25-30 min walk each way to the Rambla and harbour.

<Content>Excellent for first visit in Barcelona I stayed at hotel Covadonga on October 2006 for 4 nights. It was my first time in Barcelona, and this hotel is an excellent point to start discovering the city. It's situated on one of Barcelona's biggest avenues, and there is a bus stop right outside the hotel and a metro station nearby (about 5-10 minutes walk). Also, right opposite to the hotel is a mall with a supermarket in it so everything we could possible need, was easy to find. No need to worry about noise from the street either, as long as we keep the window closed, we couldn't hear a sound. We loved our room as it was spacious and the bathroom very clean. The hotel staff was very friendly and always willing to help us out. The only thing I didn't really like about it was the hotel breakfast as I didn't think it was the best quality they could get , but they've got a good variety so it was ok. It wasn't bad, just ok. Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay and I would definately stay there again my next time in Barcelona.

<Content>excellent!!!! Just returned from 4 days in Barcelona staying at this hotel. From the minute we stepped through the door in reception, we thought we were onto a winner and our room certainly did not let us down. Clean, spacious and a well stocked mini-bar (not that expensive for a city hotel). Staff were very pleasant, helpful and cheerful-unlike some comments I have read. We had a great time and when one of our group was unwell on the last day, they let us keep the room till 6pm FREE OF CHARGE! I don't know many hotels that would do that! Will definately stay there next time in Barcelona!

<Content>Enjoyed our stay Pros: We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and we enjoyed it alot. It was close to all types of transportations esp the tourist double decker buses. The staff were helpful when we had certain questions. They made great recommendations on different types of restuarants around the area. Rooms were of a decent size. Cons: The buffet doesn't match up to the picture that they showed us. There was no hot food available until you complained, EXTREMELY limited selection of food, and horrible service.

<Content>Great for a City break My husband, daughter (10) and I went for a short break to Barcelona. The Covadonga was clean, friendly and ideal as a base. It is a 2minute walk to the bus stop for both routes on the Bus touristic which takes you around all of the Barcelona sights. The room decor was a little dated but it was clean and it overlooked the main Diagonal street which had a fantastic atmosphere when you opened the windows.Very good value for money, breakfast ok, nothing special.Would go again

<Content>we loved it My husband and I stayed here when we went to visit a friend for Thanksgiving week. I wasn't sure what to expect since some of the reviews were bad. We actually really liked it. The room was a nice size and so was the bathroom. We had a strong, hot shower every day. The room was clean and the staff was super nice. Everyone that we needed to speak with spoke English. The breakfast buffet had a lot of choices. I travelled to a few other places after leaving this hotel and this was by far the best.We loved the location because we really didn't want to be in the middle of all the touristy places and the tourists. (plus it was not too far from my friends flat) We loved walking around and it was easy enough to walk to the metro or if you wanted you could take the shopping tram that goes down diagonal to the metro (we did this when it was really, really cold out).We booked this as part of a [-------] package and I think we got a great deal for the price we paid for the trip.

<Content>Great value for money! We stayed in the Covadonga for four nights in September. The (twin) room was spacious and clean with a balcony whilst the bathroom was large with a powerful shower. The room was cleaned daily by staff. The staff were helpful and spoke good English. The breakfast buffet offered a wide variety, including a cooked breakfast. The only negative regarding the hotel was the location. Whilst situated amongst the designer boutiques in the business district of the city it was at least a 30 minute walk to the city centre and harbour. However, there is taxi rank nearby (taxis very cheap) and the bus service was very good as well.I would recommend this hotel to a friend.

<Content>very three star HiJust returned from Barcelona and stayed in this hotel for 6 days.The room was adequate but the picture of the bar and also the first photo is not a true reflection of the hotel. The bar is very small and mostly unmanned. The hotel claims to provide a hot breakfast but if you ask the head waitress and there is more than 6 people in the restaurant Sorry too busy.I would only recommend this hotel if you are needing a place for 2 nights or during the week. Weekend less service!!.

<Content>i would stay again We stayed for a long weekend and thought it was great. big room nice bathroom, warm and clean. we had a few problems which were sorted out immediately by the staff. once we had got to grips with the excellent bus service in Barcelona we could get to most places with just one bus from directly outside the door. breakfast was great. all in all exactly what i would expect from a 3 star and very good value for money at the price we paid. the only possible negative was i think all the best balcony rooms are twins not doubles, but we liked the balcony so much that we stuck with the twin. we would reccommend to friends and definitely stay again ourselves

<Content>Fine for a city break Just returned from the Covadonga Hotel in Barcelona. It is perfectly adequate for a city break, as my fiancee and I used it for. The rooms are medium sized, and functional, although a little dingy. Upon arrival we were shown in to a room with a double bed, but the view was of a brick wall, and therefore had no sunlight! We asked to move and were then offered a room with two single beds, but also a window over looking a street, which we took. In that respect the service was immediate and good.The location of the hotel was nice in that it was on the edge of the city centre, about a 20 minute walk away (we used no trains/taxis). We liked this as the walk was pleasant and allowed us fresh air and time to walk off all the tapas we ate!On reflection, I would stay in this hotel again, but only if it was used merely as a place to rest our heads, and not for anythnig more extensive.

<Content>Not a Rip off Have just returned after spending 4 days at the Hotel Covadonga, cannot see how the two additional comments are claiming RIP off, booked hotel bed and breakfast, had good clean bedroom and no issues with breakfast. Also found staff excellent and only to happy to communicate in English if attempt at speaking to them in their native language proved to be a disaster.Good Hotel, well situated, would recommend.

<Content>Disguised RIP OFF Buffet was a total rip off. Ended up spending 35 US dollars for breakfast for 2 people that was not very good at all. Experienced EXACTLY what the other reviewer stated.The hotel was clean and within a 10 minute walking distance from the metro/15 minute walking distance from the train station.

<Content>Rip Off! Beware they speak no english . We got stuck with the breakfast bill after being told it was included. Dont sit in the breakfast area or they will charge you . The first night we were there they put us in a room the size of a closet . It was decorated in early junk. There was construction going on and the noise was loud . We couldnt wait to get out of the hotel each morning . I travel all over the world and will never recomend this place to anyone . After 7 days we were glad to get out of there .
