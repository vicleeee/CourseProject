<Content>Nice and Clean This property is well located and very well appointed.I was impressed by the King room. It had a sitting area, galley kitchenette and a separate sleeping area. Two flat screen TVs. All the usual and expected ammenities.As an integral part of the hotel, there is a Moxies Classic Grill. Food was good, plenty of large screen TVs in the bar and pricing was not too bad.Meeting rooms are OK.Based on the quality and price, I'd try other Sandman properties in the future.

<Content>The Sandman Toronto is GREAT!!! I stayed in this hotel for my sister's wedding. We had a 2-queen bed unit and she had a deluxe king bed unit with a kitchen, washer/dryer and living room area. The rooms were very nice. The decor is so fantastic that we took some of the wedding pictures there!!!The staff is professional, friendly and helpful. They are always smiling!! I would totally recommend their wedding/event planner Adrienne....she has excellent taste.  Best of all.......green apples everywhere....just for decoration or for a snack...gotta love it!!!

<Content>Classy  Called the hotel directly and they gave me the Manager's Rate which was $10 cheaper than anything I found online.Hotel is new, clean and wonderfully modern! Dark woods, sleek and looks exactly like the pictures. I wouldn't say that everything is made of the best quality but it looks great. The standard rooms only come in 2 Queen beds which really crowd the room and make it tiny.My fiance did not like the bed - neither of us really slept too comfortably. It was a little lumpy, and the sheets weren't the highest quality. However not entirely unexpected - the price is a real bargain for the atmosphere you get!Another thing - we had an elevator scare, it kind of reset and made a big jolt and stopped moving for about a minute, which was a little terrifying, but as far as I know they were fixing it that night. Probably a one-off experience.The previous comment was absolutely right on the money about the service - top notch. Didn't try out the Moxie's, but it is one of my favourite restaurant chains in Toronto and I don't doubt that the food is wonderful!Overall a great experience, a romantic weekend with the fiance. As I mentioned, the price is a great bargain for a new and impressive hotel.

<Content>Microwave, Refrigerator, Lighted Make-up Mirror, Oh My!!! They had me at lighted makeup mirror!!! What a cute little (big) hotel! I love the modern atmosphere...not like the usual old fashion, old smelling hotels. The room was very clean and had everything I needed. Yes, it doesn't have wireless (only wired) but ok, I'll overlook that. The staff is fabulous! They actually look and act like they really like their jobs!! How refreshing! 8-)The only downside is that they do have a little food store but the prices are outrageous! Come on, $2.50 for a microwave Kraft Mac-n-Cheese container?? I can get that at a grocery store for a buck! There are restaurants around but no shopping (within walking distance).

<Content>Too many positives There are too many good things about this hotel. The staff are too friendly and too helpful - including the staff at the Moxie's onsite. The food at the restaurant was too good. The rooms were too clean and ready on time. The mint shampoo was too refreshing. The hotel is too beautiful and too convenient to the airport by a regular shuttle (the driver made the extra effort to make sure everyone got on the bus to the airport on time!).The parking inlcuded with the hotel room seemed too good to be true. If you don't like to go to a great hotel with convenience, cleanliness, friendly staff, plus a good restaurant onsite with great service, then this won't be the place for you.

<Content>What a Wonderful Surprise! We usually stay at an airport hotel for strictly utilitarian reasons.... we're at the end of a trip, have an early start the next day and don't want to cope with much driving or unexpected traffic. Generally we expect a basic, clean, quiet hotel with a decent restaurant.Imagine our surprise when we walked into the Sandman, saw a strikingly attractive, large lobby, were greeted warmly by a young woman at the desk, dispatched rapidly to our room on the 5th floor, opened the door  found it very handsome indeed, quite spacious, in fact, with two large queen beds, a sitting area (this was a standard room) and great bathroom that included a huge make-up mirror, bless their hearts-- and lacked only a shower cap to score perfect plus on our rating chart.In addition, the restaurant was pretty jazzy, the service rapid, and they actually served quite good food. We were astonished. And delighted. Top marks to these folks.

<Content>The Sandman a very good choice ! This a is a newish hotel (2007) less than 10 minutes from the airport but other than the fact that outside you see and hear aircraft landing you get no disturbance. We were on the 16th floor in the penthouse suite but in reality you pay no more for this than any other room. There are two Queen Ann beds that are very comfortable (I often have difficulties with hard mattresses but these were fine. We also had a good view across the golf course being on the front of the hotel. The rooms are clean and spacious with a small balcony, we also had a microwave and fridge. The bathroom is fine, although the shower was not a walk-in there being a bath as well. Its dark furniture with a modern minimalist look but rooms are kept clean and staff are friendly particularly on the front desk. We got the impression it was a good place to work and had a very relaxed atmosphere. Its very handy obviously for the airport but as were attending a conference at the Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship only a few hundred yards away it was ideal. The only down-side was that the restaurant (Maxi's) was a bit slow with service and getting milk for our tea (being English!) seemed to be a problem. You can get a 58 bus a short walk away and then the tube in to Toronto which takes over an hour (its 20 miles) or a taxi for $50(can). All in all we highly recommend the Sandman and would happily stay there again.

<Content>What a gem! What a wonderful gem. I am in the hotel industry and I think they do a wonderful job at this hotel! The staff were terrific! Front desk were all very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful and accommodating. The rooms are lovely, clean and well appointed. Much of the decor reminds me of a W hotel rich brown tones. Lots of very nice small touches like the apples, the honor bar in the lobby, a coffee shop in the lobby and a really terrific restaurant for dinner - the food was great for dinner. The service staff in the restaurant were equally friendly and do a terrific job! Business center was free and internet was as well. I would absolutely stay here again, I look forward to the next time I have the opportunity to stay at another Sandman Hotel.

<Content>Nice surprise This was my first stay near the Toronto airport in several years. I was pleasantly surprised!!LOCATION-About as close to the airport as you could be. The shuttle was waiting for us when we walked out (we called before we went through customs).LOBBY-Striking is probably the best word. Very, very modern with sort of a W-ish feel. It's extremely modern, almost with a hard edge.You are definitely impressed and curious about what the rest of the hotel looks like.SERVICE-It was hit or miss. No one was rude, unhelpful, or unpleasant. However, some were friendlier than others. I was kind of getting the vibe that they probably aren't the happiest employees in the world. Just a feeling I got.ROOMS-Very nice. Luckily not as modern as the lobby. Very warm, inviting and cozy. The bedding was lovely and there was a very nice sitting area with a couch and 2 chairs. The bathroom was fabulous! Great tub/shower with cool toiletry items. Almost felt luxurious.THE NEGATIVE-If it wasn't for a few small things I would have probably given them an excellent. One was the inconsistent staff. The 2nd was scuff marks. Yes, scuff marks. In the hallways and in the guest rooms there were myriad scuff marks where luggage, etc has hit the walls. The fact they aren't clean/fixed shows a real lack of cleaning detail. In addition, there were a couple of spots on the carpet where it was fraying.This is a gorgeous hotel with great rooms. However, it will be a run-down 3rd tier property in a few years if the maintenance and cleaning isn't kept up!!I would definitely stay here again...at least for now!

<Content>The Perfect Birthday Getaway My boyfriend surprised me for my birthday with a trip to the Sandman Hotel by the airport. It was AMAZING. When we arrived at the Sandman, the desk clerk (I believe his name was Munir) suggested that we upgrade to a nicer room w. a Jacuzzi and separate living area for only an extra 30 bucks (we had booked on hotels.com, and got a really great rate for the room we originally booked, so an extra 30 dollars was nothing). Once the man said Jacuzzi I was sold. Lol.Upon entering our room I believe I actually squealed with delight! It was gorgeous! Very spacious, very clean, modern, and classy. The room we were upgraded to had a full kitchen -- big fridge, stove, microwave, pots and pans, cooking utensils, coffee maker, kettle, and toaster! It also had a living room w. a flat screen TV and a huge window with a view of the golf course. The bathroom was beautiful, by far the cleanest hotel bathroom I have ever seen and most modern looking...it even had a full laundry machine and dryer!Now...the best part, by far HAD to be the bedroom. The afore mentioned Jacuzzi? Is actually situated IN the bedroom. It was WICKED. The bed itself was also lovely and very comfortable.Another cool feature was that the floor was covered in a carpet that is meant to look like hardwood floor...hard to explain, you have to see this for yourself.You can even order food to your room from the Moxie's restaurant situated in the Hotel (we got breakfast...note--don't get the French toast...it was entirely drenched in a VERY sweet strawberry syrup).Overall, we ADORED this hotel and will definitely be returning! It was a lovely way to celebrate my birthday, but I would also highly recommend it to those in need of somewhere to stay when having to stop over in Toronto as it is located very close to the airport. Also, it seemed that the shuttle service there was excellent as we say several coming and going during our stay.

<Content>Wedding Bliss - Rehearsal Heaven My fiancee and I are planning to stay at the Sandman for the first night of our honeymoon. We are also hosting our rehearsal dinner at Moxie's Restaurant at the hotel the day before. Front desk, restaurant management and serving staff were absolutely awesome helping us plan the dinner. The server offered us each a cup of coffee while the two of us made plans. When it came time to settle our bill, the server refused to accept any payment whatsoever. Several weeks earlier a staff person at the front desk escorted us to see the room we had reserved earlier by phone. We are just so impressed with how well we were treated each time we were at or had any dealings with the hotel.Kudos to the management and all the staff. You are wonderful!

<Content>Excellent Rate! This was a fairly new hotel was it was booked, it was still on a 'soft opening'.I booked through CAA and got an excellent rate of $99 CAD per night, and that included 2 weeks of parking! They also provided a free shuttle to and from the airport.My first thought when I saw the hotel was clean and green apples.The check in was fast, and when I walked to the front counter and said my name one of the staff members noted that 2 bookings had been made under my name. He cancelled one of them so I didn't get charged for 2 rooms.They had a restaurant attached, I didn't use those facilities, but they give you a peice of paper to charge it to your room should you use it.When you exit onto your floor there is a mirror with a ledge on it, where they placed green apples (nice touch).My room was big and had 2 double beds and I was able to control the temperature from there, lots of towels were provided in the room as well. The only complaint that most people might have is, AIRPLANES!!!You can hear the airplanes constantly, but if you have a problem with that, then don't stay overnight at an airport hotel.

<Content>Great Stay! We called hotel direct and received great price of 119.00 which included leaving our car for 8 days and then staying at hotel on our return and shuttle to and from the airport. When we arrived we went in to get ticket for the car and to arrange shuttle to airport. The shuttle was already to go so no waiting. When we returned we called for free on the hotel phone board at the airport for the shuttle and waited about 10 minutes which was fine. We checked in and went to our room and found it very clean! The only thing I did not like decor wise was the color of the rug. We had a veiw of the golf course whcih was nice and 2 double beds non-smoking. We ate at Moxies and had a great meal in a lively place with lots of flat screen tv's, the staff was very friendly and the food was good. The tub was deep so I wanted to have a bath but could not get the plug to work so we called down for help. I did not wait as we watned to get going so I had a shower instead but someone did come within 10 minutes. I have stayed at most of the hotels and found for the price and location and it was quiet this was a good place to stay.

<Content>Best Airport Hotel Quite simply the best airport hotel in which I have stayed. It is modern, clean, well equipped with excellent staff. However, I would advise avoiding the restaurant if you value quality over convenience. I had a New York Strip that was ruined by a foul over spiced Burgundy Rub. They simply seemed to try to fancy things up too much rather than take good ingredients and cook them simply and well. The good news is that there is are numerous restaurants within walking distance including an Outback (not bad) and a Keg (outstanding)I will always try to stay here if I have to night stop through Toronto again and I will look for Sandman Signature hotels elsewhere too.

<Content>Outstanding stay at the Sandman Me and my wife stayed at the sandman the night before our flight to punta cana. We parked and had shuttles to/from the airport for free. This hotel is very upscale. The lobby is all slate tile with 8 flat screen tv's. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. At checkin, the room we were given was occupied, then the next room we were given the keys didnt work...and then the 3rd time was a charm. The girl at the front desk was very apologetic. The room are beautifully decorated. The furniture was comfortable and there was plently of lighting. The air conditioner worked awesome. And the king bed and pillows were to die for.Also, have Moxies restaurant in the hotel was a HUGE bonus. The food was excellent and the staff were friendly.We honestly dont have anything bad to say about this hotel. We are planning to stay time after time when in toronto. Cant beat the prices either !

<Content>Classy with Views of Golf Course I love a new hotel! White fluffy towels, flat screen TVs, black granite countertops.This new Signature concept will officially open later this year and appears to be a hit already.All that remains for completion seems to be the landscaping  parking lot.Modern, comfortable  tasteful decor in the lobby  individual rooms bring this hotel to the upper class of all Toronto Airport stays. At the current low price, don't pass it up - suggest a car for transportation convenience. A free shuttle is available to and from the airport.Front desk staff is professional, accommodating and friendly.Moxies is on location to serve breakfast, lunch, dinner  cocktails.Outdoor patio sofa style seating allows views of the golf course.Refreshing to experience an upscale airport hotel.

<Content>Sweet dreams at the Sandman! Stayed here on March 26th for a stopover on our way to Cuba. 2 rooms - 1 with the 2 queen beds (for 4 adults) and an Elite King room (which included a full kitchen) First impressions - Contacted the hotel over the phone several times to confirm details - staff is superb. Upon arrival we were greeted warmly, check in was very professional and friendly. This is what customer service SHOULD be! Hotel was easy to find, and parking is directly out front, and was very easy to access. Lobby is BEAUTIFUL, very chic, and well appointed. Front desk staff was great, check in was a breeze. Loved the 鈥榤arket鈥?area that had snack and sundry items available at all times. There was a small bistro/coffee area that was closed at the time we departed. (4am) Halls and common areas 鈥?very nice. Moxie鈥檚 restaurant is great 鈥?and check out the restrooms鈥y husband wants one at home!!Rooms were beautifully appointed, and with 4 adults with full gamut of luggage for a 1 week holiday was a little cramped, but not bad overall. We had a balcony, which offered a view north of the hotel, and overlooked the parking lot, so we could see our car. The other room with the kitchenette was awesome as well鈥?would have been a great option for an extended and/or business stay. If I had to pick on something 鈥?I would say the pillows are a little too large for my liking. (pretty hard to even find something to complain about!) I would, and have recommended this property to anyone!!!!! I just hope the prices don鈥檛 jump too much!!!!

<Content>Excellent Airport Hotel I stayed at the Sandman for 3 nights in February. I chose it because it was close to the airport and had a free shuttle. The shuttle was a while in picking us up but very punctual for taking us back.A nice modern, stylish hotel with a very good free business centre with computer and printer. Being able to check in online and print boarding passes when away from home is such a great help.But best of all was Moxy's the restaurant attached. The menu was excellent as was the food. We ate there every night, not having to go searching for good food was also a great bonus.

<Content>Great Hotel I just had to write a review of this hotel. I can't say enough good about our stay here, we left our car here for one week and then arrived back late in the evening they instructed us to just call for a specific taxi, and they payed for the cab fair. also they shuttled us over to catch our flight. The room was beautiful, and the beds were very comfortable. Our car was left there , in there safe parking lot. This Hotel is wonderfull, the staff are great, and they even have a bowl of fresh green apples they give out. I have stayed in airport stop over hotels before but this place is by far the nicest I have ever stayed at. Your won't be disappointed with this place, hope this helps. Charlie Moore

<Content>Outstanding Stay at the Sandman I definitely recommend a stay at the Sandman Signature Hotel if you are thinking of staying in the Toronto airport area. The customer service from the front desk to the maid service to the restaurant was excellent. My room with a view was outstanding. I do a lot of traveling both for work and pleasure and this newly opened hotel offers one of the best value price ratios in the Toronto airport market. The Sandman Signature Hotel is simply a first class hotel at reasonable rates. I most definitely will be staying there again and based on this experience I will book a room at the Calgary Sandman on my trip to Calgary in May.Bob from Ottawa

<Content>It Was Perfect The Sandman is a perfect place to stay at the airport. The beds are so comfortable, the towels really big and fluffy, the rooms well-designed. Loved the TVs and wireless internet access. It was one of the most comfortable hotels I have ever stayed in--a perfect place to be while awaiting a flight. My only tiny complaint was that I asked the man at the front desk what my options were in terms of transportation downtown, as I wanted to do a few hours of sight-seeing, and he told me that the only way to get downtown was a taxi, which ended up costing $75. I figured out my own way back to the hotel via a short subway and bus ride, which was $2.75 and only took about one hour. It was simple if you do not have a lot of luggage en tote and I wish the guy at the front desk had told me about it.I would certainly stay at the hotel again though, in a second.

<Content>First class airport area hotel I stayed at the Sandman after a 17 days trip in Canada, catching a flight early morning to the US.I then highly appreciated the in-suite washer and drier - which did a fantastic job even with delicate stuff ;-).Brand new, so spotless facilities, super comfortable bed, and quality linens and towels. Great views on the airport and airplanes to put you in the mood ;-) for the day after (although the day after, a -US?- Homeland Security Officer rude and outrageous ruined my departure and caused flight delay)Friendly staff.

<Content>Very nice stay.... We just got back from an 8 day stay in Toronto. We booked our stay at the Sandman Signature Suites through Travelocity and got a great deal with airfare.LOCATION:The hotel is only a 5 minute drive from Pearson International Airport which made it very convenient. We were approx. 20/30 minutes from downtown Toronto (traffic! can be horrible, however) and 20 minutes to the Mississauga area. Convenient highway access. Watch your speed around hotel area....we saw police everyday pulling cars over all day long throughout our stay. LOBBY  FRONT DESK:The lobby was WOW. Beautiful tile floors, decorated very contemporary with flat screen tvs, plush rugs, great artwork. Nice intimate feel. Lobby has microwave available and a small store for odds and ins. The hotel was very empty during our stay which was great! The hotel has only been open for a few months so a lot of the floors are still under construction. The restaurant is not open yet but the hotel is offering complimentary muffins, croissants, coffee and juice in the morning. The service at the front desk was great. There were at least 3 workingat all shifts and everyone was eager to give directions, say hello, and just make you feel welcome.PARKING:We parked right in front of the hotel for FREE. Never a search for a spot. Great!ROOMS:Decorated in dark brown - our room had two queen beds with brown suade bedspread, huge pillows. Flat screen tv, FREE cable internet access in room, small dining table by window, coffee maker, FREE bottled water, great bathroom towels, and bath products. Nice closet and dresser for storage. Space is a little tight between bed and dresser/tables. Bathroom has a large bathtub with shower-great water pressure. Not much counter space in bathroom.FREE perks -please keep them free!:Parking, internet in roomOVERALL:We would love to stay here again. Nice boutique style hotel. Decor reminded us of the W hotels just on a smaller scale. A great place to come back to after a long day.

<Content>Great rooms needs soundproofing We were very impressed by the room, its size, layout and decor. Very well appointed and comfortable, The Sandman has done a first class jobon this aspect of their operations. However, try to make sure you are not there during a wedding or other late night gathering. The people talking in the hall at 3:30 in the morning woke us up as it sounded like they were in the room with us.
