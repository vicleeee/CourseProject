<Content>Perfect location. Friendly Staff I stayed here Jan. 5th '09 (The Fiesta Bowl game was going on.) Although there was lots of people and traffic around the hotel and area, it was still quiet and peaceful. I never heard anything in my room. I am impressed with the total privacy of this hotel yet it is convienent (easy walking distance 5 to 10 mins) to plenty of eating places from fastfood to sitdown. I like that Target and REI is real close by. Also a mall with Dept stores: Macys, ect is right there too. This hotel has a nice pool right in the back and a beautiful golf course. The driving range is right there! I cant wait to play it sometime. The rooms are always clean ( i stay here about 6 times a year) and well maintained. I stayed here one time and there was a wedding party happening. It was rather loud in the lobby area but the rooms were perfectly quiet. You are only about 15 drive fom Scottsdale airport and about 30 min drive from PHX in moderate traffic. The beds are very comfy! The covers for the beds are plush. The rooms are big. I'd say this one ranks a grade above the standard Embassy.

<Content>Enjoyed the Embassy Suites I stayed here for five nights with my five year old daughter. Our room was very clean and seemed to have been recently updated. We had a nice view overlooking the pool and golf course. The pool is good sized with a shallow end my daughter enjoyed and it goes to five or six feet deep. There is also a hot tub next to the pool. There is Internet Access in a room with two terminals near the lobby with printers. The front desk staff were very friendly and gladly provided directions and seemed to know the area. The full breakfast was great and there is also an evening reception with happy hour type snacks, beer, wine etc. The hotel is about a half mile from a Target, convenience store and some small shops. It is in a safe area among some well kept apartments or condos. The only thing is that this hotel is not near Old Scottsdale. Although it has Scottsdale in its name it is located in Phoenix. Old Scottsdale is a good 20 minute drive. I don't golf but the driving range was getting plenty of use and looked very well kept.

<Content>Great Location. Stayed for three nights in a golf course view room (which is a must,). The view from the room is just beautiful, the front desk staff are very friendly and professional. The rooms are extremely spacious, with a large fridge, two plasma screen TV's, plenty of room to spread out. The balcony is a nice size as well. The Manager's Reception is held outside Monday - Friday and is lovely. On the weekends, it's inside. Can't beat the free drinks and snacks. The breakfast is wonderful too. The location is great. Walking distance to just about any store and restaurant you can think of, as well as a mall, and a gym. Centrally located. This was our second stay at this hotel and we plan on staying again.

<Content>Great hotel Recently stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on business, and I was really impressed with the updated decor, great service, and incredibly comfy rooms. The bed was very comfortable, the shower was just right, and the buffet breakfast was good. If staying in this area, I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Exceptional Stay I just returned from a four night stay at this property. Having never stayed at an Embassy Suties before, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. Well, the property exceeded my expectations in virtually every category; in short, it helped make a rather mundane business trip a fun and memorable vacation. Every morning begins with a large, tasty, complimentary breakfast--restaurant quality; every evening includes a 2-hour happy hour by the pool which, after a long day, could not be more appreciated; the room itself was spacious, clean, modern, and welcoming, unlike so many other mid-level properties; the location was not on a major thoroughfare and thus was quiet and relaxing; lastly and most importantly, the staff is incredibly friendly and accomodating...they seem to enjoy working there and that goes a long ways towards making the stay a success. I would certainly stay here again and would recommend the same to anyone else who's tired of either worn down, malaised properites or overpriced hoity-toity places that simply don't live up to what the customer is paying. Thanks to all who made my stay so memorable, especially Lauren at Tatum's Bar and Eric at the front desk.

<Content>Fantastic property! We came to this hotel hoping to relax for a week. Our expectations were greatly exceeded. This property is one of the best Embassy Suites I have ever stayed at. The property itself is very well maintained, with an upgrade going on now that was very unobtrusive. The room was extremely comfortable and had a nice view of the golf course and the Phoenix mountains. But what sets this property apart is the staff. We were personally greeted by a manager, Brian Wright. He went out of his way to make our stay comfortable and restful. His suggestions for restaurants and shopping in the area were very helpful. The weekend bell man, Dave, was very helpful too. The front desk staff were always courteous and efficient. The breakfast staff were cheerful every morning. We are looking forward to our next stay at this property!

<Content>Good Value Stayed here for one night prior to booking in to our regular resort for the week.Paid an extra $10 to have an upper floor room with a view of the pool and adjoining Stonecreek golf course.This was well worth it as we had a very nice corner unit with excellent views.The Managers Reception in the evening was OK as long as you stayed with beer as the other drinks were all made using very low quality liquor.The snacks were an insult as they were of such low quality,in fact they should not even bother to put that stuff out.The breakfast that is also included in the price was much better and the guy who was making four different omelettes at the same time,with a smile on his face,was great!Give him a raise!I couldn't believe how close the golf course was;it came right up to the hotel.You were able to walk out from your room straight onto the practice range and start hitting balls.I was surprised at the apparent high quality of the condition at Stonecreek and next time I go I will set aside enough time to play the course.All in all for the price we obtained on the hotel website this was good value and we would stay here again.

<Content>Great Value in Scottsdale. We just got back from a 5 night stay stay at the Embassy Suites in Scottsdale. Hotel was just great. Very comfortable beds, lots of room in suite, very clean and good pool area. If you are looking for a great value in pricey Scottsdale this is a great choice. The hotel is right on the golf course and was about a 10 - 15 minute drive to downtown Scottsdale ( where the fashion square mall and other shops  restaurants are). Next time we go to Scottsdale and are looking for a great value we would definitely stay here. And the cooked to order breakfast with other hot selections is great. And managers evening reception is fun too!

<Content>Lovely Setting - Extra Attentive Staff This is a lovely hotel in a very lovely setting located on a golf course on the north side of Camelback mountain. The views from the grounds and from our room (overlooking the pool, golfcourse, AND the mountain) makes the price of the stay an extra good deal. Our room was spacious, considering we have 4 kids - including a toddler. In addition to the door between the bedroom and the living room, the bathroom had a dividing door between the vanity and the tub and toilet, so that it can accomodate multiple users in need of privacy. There were plenty of choices at breakfast including a hot buffet for those who don't want to wait for cooked to order food.Most hotels have friendly staff and good service. It's mainly the degree of attentiveness that make the difference. With our experience, the ones at this hotel rise to the top of our list. We were stopping for the night on the way up to Sedona and GCNP. Our plane arrived on Easter Sunday evening and check-in took place well after 10PM. When we planned the trip, we hadn't considered the possibility that the circumstance would leave us with zero dining option because all the eateries closed extra early due to the holiday. The front desk staff checked several places for us with no luck. Knowing that we had 4 children in tow, the staff sent up a bunch of snack items from the vending machines and extra bottles of water just to make sure we wouldn't go to bed hungry.We really appreciated the gesture. Thank you so much for giving us a great start to our vacation.

<Content>Embassy Delivered Our son was to be married and we were looking for a property that could accommodate us and our out-of-town family and friends comfortably and affordably. The rooms were spacious, the complimentary breakfast surpassed expectations, the staff was helpful and friendly, and the four nights at the Embassy turned out to be a very good experience. The feedback we received from those in our party of more than 25 was all positive. One of our four nights was spent in the Presidential Suite so that we could host a party for our group, and (except for a broken jacuzzi) all was well. We would recommend the hotel to others in similar situations. Thank you, Evelyn, for your assistance in the booking!

<Content>Can't beat the value We stayed here for a week in early June, spending most of our time in Phoenix, along with a couple of days at the Grand Canyon and a day in the Tucson area. Phenomenal value for the money (we prepaid via the Internet several months in advance)--consistently pleasant service, beautiful setting, and a nice pool--the latter wasn't huge, but was very nice and bigger than I had expected from the hotel's web photos. The room, breakfast and daily manager's special were all up to Embassy standards. The only mildly sour note was the F.O.E. convention that took over (and I mean took over) the property our last several days there. Still, this was, dollar-for-dollar, probably the best hotel value I've experienced. We'd definitely stay here again.

<Content>Nice, quiet location A very nice and quiet location with shopping and restaurants close by. Our room was spacious and comfortable, although it was a bit dated. The beds were very comfortable. Tatum's Restaurant was excellent. Room service was slow and the food arrived cold. The complimentary breakfast was a bit of a hassle - long lines, warm orange juice and we had to wait quite a while for our omelets to be cooked. The following mornings we just grabbed some yogurt and fresh fruit. before heading out for the day. The staff is nice and very accommodating. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Embassy Suites ruined our vacation!!  We have stayed at the Embassy Suites, Scottsdale-Phoenix, every year for spring training, but our last visit will be our final visit!! When we first arrived, we were promised a Perfect 10 visit - what a joke!!! The first day, we received no housekeeping - not a big deal!! But, the second day, when we received no housekeeping it was a problem. So, we had to beg the staff for towels. Still, no big deal. (Hey, we're paying $300 a night, what do you expect!!) Then, we were double charged for internet service - oh well. Now, here's the kicker - the third day, we went out to the parking lot and all the passenger windows on our Expedition were smashed in, and my son's school books, dvd/cd player were gone. The staff admitted that the parking lot had no security and that this had happened before. They offered absolultely no assistance!!! The alleged managers Paul and John were pathetic. The purported real manager Carol could not be contacted, but we were promised a call from Carol immediately when she returned - it's been two weeks - no contact from Carol, yet!! We had to spend the entire day dealing with police, rental car companies, insurance companies, and glass companies. This was susposed to be a vacation - it turned into the biggest headache and hassle. The hotel managers' attitude was To bad for you; you trusted us! When we reminded them that they promised us a Perfect 10 visit, they just looked at us like we were crazy. They offered no transportation to the rental car place, no assistance dealing with the police... Their lack of concern, help, etc... was shocking and appalling!!!! We will never stay at Embassy Suites again!!! And recommend that if you do stay at this hotel, don't expect anything, but hassles, poor service, and no security!!

<Content>Nice, Clean  I stayed with my husband and my 4 yrs. old daughter from July 17-July 23, 2006. I chose this place because I read that it was a safe place. Since I was alone with my child most of the time (and the news of 2 serial killers in Phoenix), safety was a serious issue for us. I found the hotel nice and clean. We loved the breakfast partly cooked by order. The service at the restaurant was excellent although the food is not great. We ate at the restaurant several times and I can recommend the burgers, tortillas, quesadillas, hot dogs, chicken strips and wings, salads and fruits. ( Did not like the pizza.) Room service was good and very fast. We found the room big and fairly clean but the tub needed an upgrade. The main dissapointment was with the maids, they cleaned the room very late in the afternoon most of the days and they were kind of rude...we needed to request hand towels and toilet papers several times...Overall is a good place to stay.

<Content>Beautiful views! We stayed here for one night, July 1, 2006. We stayed on the fifth floor with a wonderful view of the swimming pool and the golf course. The made to order breakfast was very good. Since the hotel has Scottsale in it's name, I incorrectly assumed it would be closer to the main shopping areas of Scottsdale, but it was about 10 miles away. But, traffic wasn't bad so it wasn't a problem. We did have several problems with the room: the sliding glass door leading to the balcony would not lock, the mini-fridge didn't work at all, and the sink and the shower were very, very slow to drain. We would have asked for a different room if we had been staying longer. We had a rate of $99.75 with tax included. This was a good rate considering the size of the rooms, which included a bedroom with two beds and a t.v., a comfortable sofa bed in the living room, and a large dressing area separated by a door from the toilet and shower. Overall, I was disappointed with some of the problems with the room but would try the hotel again if I needed to stay in Phoenix and the price was right.

<Content>Good value -- especially off season I stayed here in mid-June for a business meeting. $89 rate.The hotel was undergoing renovation, and the lobby was busy with construction. However, most other public areas were completed, as was my guest room on the fifth floor.The new decor is very modern and brightly colored, but attractive (with the exception of the clown colors in the guest room corridors.) The room itself was roomy, very nicely furnished, and had a newer, comfortable mattress. Bathing section of the bathroom (toilet  tub) was dimly lit, however.The breakfast buffet was good (standard Embassy Suites fare) with eggs cooked to order and various breads, cereals, fruit and yogurt. At lunch time, the dining area transforms to Tatum's Restaurant and has a reliable menu with good variety. Staff throughout the hotel is excellent...very friendly foodservice staff, bar man, front desk, etc. Note, I didn't make any special requests. We used a small meeting room on the 2nd floor; it's cramped for a meeting of more than 8, and had uncomfortable stacking type chairs rather than boardroom chairs plus a tiny whiteboard/screen. So if you are organizing a group meeting larger than that, check out the larger rooms on the first floor. Golf course looked great but we didn't have time to play.

<Content>Liked It We spent only one night there on the way back from northern Arizona -- before making the long drive home. Could have stayed there a couple nights, and we don't even play golf. We had just returned from an awful hotel in the same chain in Flagstaff and were thrilled to be at a nice place again. Large and well-kept rooms. The pools are large and warm to the point of bath water. No complaints.Can't comment on the golf course, obviously.Lot's of chain store shopping and restaurants nearby. A real good family Mexican restaurant is close, called JG's or something like that.

<Content>Good location Overall, it was a good hotel. We stayed in room 4042 which had a private balcony overlooking the golf course. The room was clean and quiet. The hotel was located in a good area with plenty of shopping and restaurants close by. The breakfast in the morning was very good with omelets and eggs made to order, plus fresh fruits, and cereals.

<Content>A nice place for the most part..... we stayed here over Christmas and got an amazing rate. I would say its above average for Scottsdale hotels unless you go the resort route and I don't count this place as a resort. The hotel was very nice... the staff very helpful and courteous.Breakfast was typical embassy suites fare, but for the rate we paid, a nice asset.Our room was fine, not dirty (and I am a dirt freak) in the least. The bed was rather soft and yes the sheets did not fit and the door does slam rather loudly, but none were dealbreakers for us. I should mention that the hotel was only about 50% full so perhaps that made things more tolerable in terms of the noise, breakfast, etc. Not sure what it would be like during spring training which is the busiest time of year. The only real bummer was trying to get my cell phone charger back that fell out of my bag in the room. Lost and found there was kind of lame...They had to charge me with a cc# for packing it up and shipping it even though I offered to give them a fedex # and ups #.... Charging for putting it in a fedex envelope?While in Scottsdale, be sure to try Don and Charlies. YUM! A great place for steak lovers and baseball fans.

<Content>Probably Won't Return Husband and I had a long stay of 12 days. We had to wait a little over a hour for room to be ready, so no early check in here. I had asked for a quiet room with a view. There was no gaurantee that we would have a room with a view unless we paid $20 more a night, so we choose to pay. I ended up with a room over the swimming pool which was all but quiet.The carpet was so stained and dirty that you did not want to walk around bare footed. The couch was stained especially on the arms. The dining room menu had very little selections but with high prices. I don't think there was much help in the kitchen. The bed was uncomfortable, not because of the mattress but because of the bedding that did not fit. Small gift shop for a hotel this size. We had made reservations to eat the Thanksgiving Buffet. There were not many names on the reservations when I made reservations for 3. Our table was the worse in the whole dining room, right in the isle so people had to pass our table. We asked for another table but was told the tables were already assigned even though there were other empty table with 3 place settings and chairs. The doors of the rooms closed loudly so each time someone near you left their room you would hear it. Unfortunately a family with 4 or 5 children ran up and down the hallways and in and out of their rooms slamming their doors each time. It would actually shake the wall. We complained to management but it didn't help and there was no follow up by management regarding the complaint. If it wasn't that it was holiday week, we would have tried to move to another hotel. The free full breakfasts and the free drinks at Manager's nights are some of the nice amenities. The personnel was very friendly and attentive. Overall I would not return, for what we ended up paying for 12 days and what we got we could have paid an extra $50 a night and got a 4 star hotel with cleaner, more comfortable room and it would have been worth it.

<Content>Loved it We thought this hotel was terrific. We had a golf course view and it was beautiful and quiet. It was too hot to enjoy the balcony but it was beautiful to look at. We did enjoy the happy hour and the homemade breakfast - everything was delightful and we would stay there again when in the area. The only complaints that we did have were the pillows were terrible (the beds were very comfortable though) and there was no good lighting in the entire suite for us girls to put on our make-up. They definitely need to have a make-up mirror in the bathroom or better lighting to help us! That's the only suggestions that we would make - otherwise, we loved the entire place.

<Content>Very Convenient Location! We just returned from a 4 night stay here and overall it was a great place to stay. It was so convenient to everything. We asked for and received a quiet corner room, high floor with a view. We stayed in Room #5042 which overlooked the golf course. We had read about the loudspeaker calling out the tee times on this site, but never once heard the loudspeaker from our room. The only complaint that my husband and I had, like others, was the bed was really hard and uncomfortable. But for the discounted rate we got through AAA and the free cooked to order breakfast each morning, we felt it was a wonderful value and would definitely stay there again. There was a bar charge on our bill that was not ours and when I mentioned it at check-out, the young desk clerk was rather surly about taking the time to remove it while I waited, but she did because I told her I wasn't leaving until she had corrected our bill. All in all though, it's a nice place to stay.

<Content>Not as good as last year, but great location Our main disappointment upon registering this year was that no effort was made to give us a room w/golf course view like last year. Had to stay in a suite overlooking parking lot the first night. We were finally transferred after 2 additional requests but ended up on the noisy side of golf course where every morning beginning before 7:00 am they announce players going out w/microphone! The front desk was certainly lacking from last year but the concierge(s) made up for it as did the bellman and bar staff. The golf course on site is very convenient even though they do not offer a junior golfer rate as do some of the premiere courses like Talking Stick. We were told the hotel has recently been sold and to expect some wonderful cosmetic changes in the area around pool, etc. You can't beat the location in Paradise Valley around Tatum and easy access to hiking at Squaw Peak and Camelback Mountain.

<Content>Excellent value but not much character We had a nice big suite ($212) on the top floor with a big bed, large bathroom, large living room with kitchenette, large balcony overlooking the golf course. Icing on the cake was that it was Easter and there was free happy hour drinks when we got there and free breakfast in the morning. It's not somewhere to go if you want character or romance but it's useful for the area and getting to the airport and Scottsdale (we had a great meal at Razz's restaurant). Looked like a nice (not huge) pool outside.

<Content>Great views Beautiful view from balcony and a great breakfast. Pool is very small as others have indicated. Room size was nice but instead of 2 queens there are 2 full size beds with a pullout full in the sofa. We brought an air mattress so it worked out but it would have been torture with three kids without it. The hotel is in Paradise Valley rather then Scottsdale (unless this is considered part of Scottsdale?). Emphasis is on golf but it was still has a lot to offer even if you don't. We stayed 3/30 through 4/2 and the weather was fantastic.

<Content>Nice, but Hard Beds! The hotel itself was very nice. The suite was a good size with a kitchenette, a nice size fridge and microwave. The room I had was on the third floor and overlooked the roof of the meeting rooms below, but in the distance you can see the mountains. The morning breakfasts were great, just make sure you get there early enough to get a table, but they do warn you of the busy times. The seating area definitely needs to be larger. The evening manager's reception was nice, you could sit outside or in the lounge area inside with a large screen tv.I was there on business so never was able to try out the golf course, but it looked great. The pool looked a little small, but again, wasn't able to take a dip. My major disappointment was with the beds. They were rock hard, no give in them whatsoever. I woke up stiff every morning. The one thing you want when you go away on business is a good night's sleep, unfortunately I didn't get that.If they ever get better mattresses, there is no doubt I would love to stay here again. But until that happens I'll have to stay away.

<Content>Loved the hotel, but My husband and I stayed at the Embassy Suites Phoenix-Scottsdale and we really enjoyed the hotel. While staying there I observe housekeeping washing out the drinking glasses w/vinegar  hot water (does not kill germs) and washing the toliet seat w/the same toliet brush that was used inside the toliet. I did bring it to the manager attention. We later bought wipes to clean the drinking glasses and wipe the toliet seat. Just never leave home without your wipes. We have already plan to return back to this hotel in the future. My husband really enjoy playing golf at the hotel.

<Content>Loved the Embassy Suites The stay at the Embassy Suites was extremely enjoyable. The rooms are a good size, the fridge is big enough to fit food and drinks, the view from our balcony was beautiful(we faced the golf course).The staff is extremely helpful, friendly and are there to take care of you. The buffet breakfast was very delicious, they warn you that certain times of the morning may be busy, but we seemed to always get a table and they never ran out of food. We also found the manager's reception to be excellent, they would lay out good snacks and have plenty of beverages.I would definately stay there again.
