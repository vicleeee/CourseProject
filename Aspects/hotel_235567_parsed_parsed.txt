<Content>Book this hotel its fantastic! Just dont book through Alpharooms! My partner and I stayed at this hotel over my birthday and new year and I cannot recommend this hotel to you more.We arrived on my birthday, very tired after an early start on the Eurostar to find that, although we had paid for an upgrade to an Executive Room, we had been given a standard room. (The standard room however was beautifully decorated and not as small as we expected from what previous reviewers have written on this site.) After speaking to the Hotel's manager Francois, we discovered that Alpharooms, whom we had booked with, had taken payment from our credit card for an Executive Room but had only paid the hotel for their standard room. Francois and his staff were immediately apologetic, despite it not being their wrong doing. We called Alpharooms in order to rectify the situation but found them to be extremely rude and unhelpful. They refused to take any blame. They stated that we would have to stay in the standard room and when we returned to UK we would need to email their customer services department explaining our problem all over again and then they MIGHT or MIGHT NOT look into refunding us for the extra we had paid to upgrade. Of course we were not happy with this we had reserved the room 3 months prior ot travel. After being on the telephone to Alpharooms for over and hour, we still had not even been offered an apology. Francois suggested that we give up with Alpharooms leave it to him and his staff.We went up to our standard room and after our nap received a knock at the door with a member of staff bearing gifts of beautiful perfume and champagne. We were also informed that the hotel was fully booked for the first two nights of our stay but for the remaining duration of our stay we would be upgraded. True to their word on our second morning we were given keys to a beautiful suite on the top floor, with a Jacuzzi bath, rain shower, separate seating area and outside terrace area with views over Paris and of the Eiffel Tower (room 601). To top it all off we woke up the following morning to snow shower.I cannot fault this hotel. The location is perfect. Walking distance to Champs Elysees, Arc De Triomphe and Eiffel Tower and numerous metro stations. The decor is stunning, the breakfast plentiful and tasty with a good selection but what makes it stand out in my opinion from many other hotels that I have visited is the staff. Nothing was too much trouble, they were extremely attentive without being interfering. Thank you Francois and the staff at Hotel Keppler you made my birthday and our new year something to remember.We shall be returning but this time we will be booking directly with the hotel and avoiding Alpharooms at all costs, we advise that you do too!

<Content>the staff were simply amasing and the hotel fantastic The hotel is perfectly placed for your stay in Paris. The staff were amasing!!!! cant say this enough. The room was fantastic also. We stayed in executive suit and the room was perfect size, no 104( having read previous reviews about room size) The reason for my trip to paris was the propose. I had emailed the staff previous to let them know about this special occasion so they could make the room up to my requirements. They got back to me very quick indeed and had the room perfect for my arrival. They gave us complementary bottle of champagne upon arrival which was a nice touch. I asked for them to recommend a place to eat for the occasion, to which they showed me les ombres. Fantastic eating!! the view was amasing. They organised it for me at the last minute and managed to get me in to eat that nite at the time we wanted, was very impressed. Can see exactly why this hotel is in top 100 beautiques in the world!! and top 10 in paris, fantastic and unique place to stay. Go there!!

<Content>Same as expected except for the small room I stayed this hotel only for one night. The hotel is exactly what I expected from other reviewers comments. Close access to Champs Elysees and Metro station, highly professional and kind staff, very clean and good facilities of the room, delicious and variety of breakfast, etc. Only one thing I was really disappointed was size of the room. I booked Standard room through online travel agency but room was extremely small and asked front desk if this is really standard or not. He looks a little bit hesitate and said smallest size of our Standard Room. I asked may be this is your Classic room but he didn't change his comment. So, I was not sure at that time whether my room is really Standard or Classic, I gave up to ask anymore. However after I returned from my trip, I saw my room was Classic in their web site. I guess this is because of my price from Agoda which was quite cheaper than all other web site for Standard. If front desk told me the true reason, may be I'm not so regret with considering how much I paid. So, I have to downgrade the rate -1.0 for small size and another -1.0 for not telling me the true story.Classic rooms are located from floor 1-4 and room number's are 3 and 5. May be you can check the hotel which room you will get before you check-in.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel I stayed at this hotel for four nights in early November. The hotel is within walking distance to many of the sites in Paris and close to a couple of metro stops. When I arrived I was upgraded to a suite which was fantastic. The room was quiet, spacious and warm. There was a separate sitting room which led to the main bedroom. The bathroom had a separate bath and shower. The hotel staff were very helpful and responsive.

<Content>Lovely hotel, great situation Westayed at the Keppler hotel September 2008.When we arrived at the hotel after a long trip from Japan, we appreciated the quick and efficient check in.The room was nice and clean and well decorated but extremely small. I think that most hotel rooms in Paris are small, but this one was so small you could hardly open the wardrobe door as it couldn't clear the bed.The bathroom was very nice and clean and very pretty.I have 2 complaints about the bathroom:1. The shower only dribbled out and we asked them to fix it. It was fixed the day before we left and we were there for 6 days.2. The hairdryer was permanently attached under a shelf so you have to bend down to use it if you are over 5ft tall. I am 5ft7.The location of the hotel was great, close to the Arc de Triomphe, the Eiffel Tour and the Champs Elysee and there were lots of Metro stations around.Try and get a deal that includes breakfast. Do NOT believe that there are lots of nice little cafes around where you can get a good, inexpensive breakfast. There are not.On the whole the hotel was clean,comfortable and safe and the staff were really nice and helpful.We loved it.

<Content>Gem of a hotel This is the second time I have stayed here, the first time with my husband, the second time with a group of girl friends away for a shopping trip. The proximity of the hotel to the Champs Elysees and other attractions cannot be faulted, but it is just far enough off the main drag to afford peace and quiet. The decor is lovely, everything is fresh and has a very French feel to it. Yes, the first time I stayed, the room was a bit small, but the second time around, the room was spacious and the attention to detail just as good.But what makes this hotel apart from the location and the decor is the fact that the staff are extremely helpful, courteous and polite. Nothing is too much trouble, from confirming reservations for us at the Ritz, to organising dinner bookings, arranging taxis etc. Very friendly and helpful staff, which just made our stay so much the more enjoyable.

<Content>Good choice! Just back from a 2 night stay which was very enjoyable. Stayed in a standard room which although small was of very good standard. Fittings and fixtures were all good quality. A couple of small niggles - on arrival our room smelt of smoke which on mentioning it at reception they apologised and sent the cleaner to spray air freshner. I hadpreviously emailed the hotel and requested a non-smoking room as my partner is asthmatic. Also the room was very hot and the air conditioning had been switched off in the rooms for the winter so you had no control. Had to leave the window open at all times to keep the room temperature comfortable. That aside the hotel is lovely, the public rooms decorated and furnished beautifully. The breakfasts are very satisfying and all staff very pleasant.

<Content>Fantastic Keppler Hotel Keppler, Paris, FranceOctober 23 - 28 2008 My girlfriend and I spent 4 fantastic nights at the Keppler and would gladly recommend it to anyone going to Paris. This is a romantic, charming hotel, with lovely decor, and excellent/attentive staff. We were treated with the utmost courtesy. The hotel is ideally located close to the George V metro station, just 4 blocks off the Champs Elysees. Although close to the main thoroughfares( Avenue Marceau and the Champs Elysees) the rooms are really quiet. The only (small) nit I would say is that the rooms are a little small..maybe 'quaint' is a better term. Forgot to mention the fantastic workout/sauna/steam room facilities that are on site. Awesome. Have fun when you go. We'll certainly be back.

<Content>loved the keppler I stayed at the keppler with my girlfriend for 2 nights on 21 and 22 october. I was to stay on the 20th october as well but the hotel phoned me when i was at the airport before i flew to paris to tell me that there were over booked on that night so they said they would but me up in the hotel vernet which is a few streets away from the keppler. When i got to the hotel vernet i was put into one of there suites which was lovely. The following day our suitcases were picked up for us and we went to the keppler hotel for our 2 night stay. I had booked an executive room but was up graded to one of there suites which was a way of making up for the mistake in my booking. The staff were so nice to myself and my girlfriend and we were looked after so well for our 2 nights stay there. The room had a balcony which we could sit out and have a drink which was so nice. The room service was also used by us and a big thanks to the gent who got us our drinks and food. I used the breakfast room for the 2 mornings and again the staff were great. I could not say a bad word about the hotel and its staff and myself and my girlfriend had a great time there.

<Content>Believe the Reviews I know nowhere else in Paris that strikes such a good balance between comfort and quality on the one hand and character on the other. The building is beautiful and has been very well decorated. The decor (black / cream with bright yellow highlights) is modern without being overly trendy. Quality of fittings and furnishings is high, especially the funky automatic dimmer switches. One point that stands out is the air con / heating, which is completely silent, so you can leave it on over night without being kept awake. I know of only one other hotel where its equally good. Staff are very pleasant and friendly, and the location is excellent, quiet but very close to the Etoile.Only two small gripes. Firstly the bedding is sheets and blankets rather than duvets, which I would much prefer. Secondly although the bathroom is beautfiul the shower seriously lacks power - just a trickle rather than the full blast you would expect.That aside this place is great. I come to Paris regularly but have never been able to get a room. After this week, I've already booked my next trip in advance.

<Content>25th anniversary choice The Keppler is as advertised. We arrived, jet-lagged and shown to an executive room which smelled of smoke. Not the greatest of introductions, but the hotel made it right. They put us in a suite that night but then had to move the next day (sad - the suite was really nice. Even had a view of the Eiffel Tower). As it was our 25th anniversary, a nice bottle of bubbly was chilling in our room when we arrived.We ended up in an Executive Room on the 3rd floor. It faced the courtyard which is actually quite pleasant. Without exaggeration, it was THE QUIETEST room I've ever stayed in. I can say that because I travel with a mini recording studio and microphone. The air-conditioning seeps through an unobtrusive vent above the bed and doesn't make a sound either.A real bonus for me and my midnight recording session hookups back to the States.The staff was fabulous. Especially Phillipe. You might think this strange, but we never even looked at the breakfast room. Its not that I'm cheap. Well, okay, so I'm a little cheap... but I really prefer eating the way the locals do. We walked down the street to a cafe for the BEST croissants I've ever had. So much so that I actually preferred the plain to the chocolate! Oops- sidetracked. I just couldn't bring myself to spend 22 Euros PER PERSON for breakie... Oh, and maybe some of that is because if you need internet which I did - it's expensive too. 88 Euros for 5 days or 22 per day (ouch).Despite this the stay was fantastic and I highly recommend this hotel. The fabrics, decor and cleanliness where stellar. And this is coming from an EXTREMELY picky hotel guest. Strange thing - the street is RUE KEPLER, but the hotel is spelled KEPPLER (two P's). Strange indeed.PS - just down the street is VELIB the Paris bike rental system. DO IT. It's really fun and easy.PPS - Try a Parisian macaroon. anywhere. Two places I can highly recommend for them are PAULS (multiple locations) and the mother of macaroon shops on the Champs, LADUREE. WOW.

<Content>Just perfect! Stayed at The Keppler in September after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. So glad we did, because amongst the thousands of hotels in Paris, The Keppler was perfect! Great location, beautiful hotel and staff who just couldn't do enough to help. It's not a huge hotel and it almost felt like staying in a private house. We were made to feel welcome from the moment we stepped foot in the door. It was our first trip to Paris and we can highly recommend this hotel. Yes, it's a little pricey - but worth it, especially if you're having a special getaway. Only thing I'd say is avoid the breakfast. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it, but you can grab a croissant and coffee for half the price around the corner!

<Content>Really great experience at the Hotel Keppler We stayed at the Hotel Keppler in August and had a terrific experience. Our executive double was spacious and nicely furnished. The room looked just like the photos on the website. We had a view of the courtyard and felt the room was quiet and very clean. We were able to get a third night for free by booking through a discount site, which was terrific.The breakfast was wonderful -- full of all the delightful French pastries you would expect -- plus eggs (even omelettes to order, I think).Most noteworthy, though, was the staff. Every person we encountered at the hotel was friendly and the men at the front desk could not have been more helpful. They spoke perfect English and were very forgiving of my lousy French. All in all, a really great experience.

<Content>Gorgeous Hotel Spent 3 days at the Keppler and loved it from the minute we arrived.It is a lovely place - really well decorated. The staff were really friendly, much more so than at other hotels i have stayed in but without being overly fussy.The rooms (we stayed in a classic room which is their regular one) were lovely. Yes they are small but no more so than other Parisian hotels and the beautiful decoration more than makes up for it. The rooms had every comfort you could need and the bathrooms especially were great/ We didn't use either service but nice to have room service and also a spa - if I go back i will definately try them both!Location is good - obviously steos away from the C.E and great for metro stops etc. In my opinion not great for choice of good, reasonably priced food - lots of chain restaurants around on main road but these weren't my ideal choice! Nice brasseries around the side streets and near the hotel though. Lots of top end places too but these were out of our budget! Not a big problem though as easy to take metro anywhere.All in all definatley would recommend this hotel - if you like luxury and good location with great staff you can't go wrong! really nice breakfast too!

<Content>Super Hotel - believe the hype! Just a short review to say how fantastic the Hotel Keppler is. We stayed for three nights in an Executive room with our baby. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, and they sorted out a cot for us. The room was large and spacious and the bathroom superb.Breakfast in bed every morning at no extra cost was a great touch and I cannot fault the hotel at all. Very clean, modern and the staff polite, friendly and professional. About 5 minutes walk from the Champs-Elysees and the Arc de Tromphe - super location!Downstairs there is a gym and a sauna and steam room, and all are state of the art and modern (not that we had time to use them).Would definitely visit again!

<Content>Love this Hotel We loved this hotel. The staff, location and decor were all fantastic. We had a king double deluxe room which was perfect. So beautifully decorated, so French. We felt really comfortable in this hotel. It is in a lovely quiet street but so close to lots of tourist icons. Staff gave us great sightseeing advice. Good tip to catch Metro to Louvre and enter across from station (not thru glass pyramid). This saved us heaps of time - no queue, we walked straight in, couldn't believe it. They also booked us into 'Kong' restaurant and managed to get us a table (great restaurant, good views, great atmosphere). We definitely want to stay at this hotel again - we miss it already!

<Content>Just terrific The Hotel Keppler is a fabulous boutique hotel. The location is great--centrally located but on a quieter street so there's not much noise. The rooms were well-decorated and spotless. I loved this hotel and will definitely stay there again the next time I'm in Paris.

<Content>An Excellent Stay... I booked a three night stay at this Hotel for my partner's 40th Birthday. It was wonderful. The staff were helpful and friendly. Our room was beautifully decorated - like the rest of the hotel - clean and welcoming. Everything had been thought about carefully and it showed. I'd recomend this hotel to anyone but particularly those looking for a romantic break and couples without chidlren. It was also situated just off the Champs Elysees and near Georges V metro and so was convenient for everythingI'd also recomend Le Dome du Marais where we had a wonderful meal

<Content>top class hotel just back from four day stay at the keppler hotel. this was our fourth time in paris and this is without doubt the best hotel we stayed in. the hotel is spotless and the rooms were cleaned to a high standard every day. the rooms contained everything one needed including a mini bar. the hotel is perfectly situated in a quite street and is less than a five minute walk to arc de triomphe or midway down the champ de elyeese. there is a good local bakery around corner and local shop for drinks and such like. the breakfast in morning is excellent with top class service. have seen on other reviews that people have complained about the size of room. this is paris and no hotel rooms are of a size similar to other countries. but i found that there was more than enough space. would definetly be back and recommend this hotel to anyone

<Content>Superbe Stayed recently for a 3 night break, celebrating my birthday along with my wife. From the moment we stepped into the air conditioned reception, following a journey from GDG airport on the bus. We both cannot fault the hotel whatsoever. The friendliness, the assistance, and the warm atmosphere of the place, gave us confidence in the place right from the start. I have always looked on Trip Advisor for information that people kindly share for others, but never having commented myself before. I just felt that because we were so pleased with our decision to stay at the hotel, it warranted a comment. Thankyou to Phillipe, Matheau and all the staff at the Keppler.Certainly will go back and stay there again.

<Content>Four Star Hotel With Five Star Staff We stayed three nights in July and immediately were impressed with Staff greeting and pre arranged flowers to room,restaurant booking and taxi taken care of. With previous experience of claimed four star status we were wary of our expectations.Happily , the Keppler is worthy of its status with a fresh, bright aspect and almost tranquil flavour. The staff put the final polish on our stay.Very proffesional with friendly , helpful attitude gave us a memorable hotel experience.

<Content>Wonderful boutique hotel Great boutique hotel. Stayed June 27-July 2 with wife. Had standard room which was modern, clean, and fresh. Smallish by North American standards but acceptable for Europe. Larger rooms were available. On side street so rooms very quiet. All front staff excellent and very helpful with tour and restaurant reservations. Five minute walk to Champs Elysees and George V Metro station. Great mid-upper level restaurants 5-6 minutes away on rue Marbeuf including French, Italian, and Chinese where dinner for two with wine ran 65 Euros. Skipped expensive hotel breakfast for local boulangerie around corner at 13 rue Bassano for cafe au lait and croissant for 3 euros per person. Would highly recommend Hotel Keppler for couples, lovers, and the like and would return without hesitation.

<Content>Excellent Service after an initial problem! My wife and I had booked some time ago to stay 3 nights in a standard room (figuring we wouldn't need more in Paris) and had also e-mailed the hotel a few days beforehand to confirm the reservation to be told everything was fine. When we arrived, however, we were informed there was a problem and that for the first night we would have to stay at their sister hotel a few streets away - the Francois 1er. As an apology, however, they said that when we returned to the Keppler they would upgrade us to a penthouse suite, which they did. The room we were given at the Francois 1er was a superior room and was not a bad size but did have a tiny bathroom. Overall we liked both hotels very much - they are both located very near to the Champs Elysees and George V metro station. Our suite at the Keppler, apart from having a wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower had two en-suite bedrooms, a sitting room and a total of 5 televisions. Breakfasts were fine and the service very attentive but not over the top. I would highly recommend both if you want comfort and style in a chic location. We paid around 拢300 for the three nights - if we had paid top-dollar rate it would have been closer to 拢1800 so we have no complaints whatsoever!

<Content>Fantasic Hotel What a lovely friendly hotel. The standard rooms are a little on the small size but beautifully decorated. The foyer and dining room were exquisite. The breakfasts were excellent. The staff were extremely helpful and all round its a really fantastic place to stay. This is one I definitely want to visit again

<Content>A Lovely Boutique 4 Star Hotel! Our stay---July 3 to July 8This is a lovely boutique hotel that I booked through GTAHOTELS at a terrific rate! We pre-paid the hotel in US Dollars and that helped tremendously. We booked a standard room and as others have said, they are beautifully decorated. The rooms appear to be very clean and the beds are comfortable. We had a street side room but, I didn't notice much noise which was great! When I spoke to the concierge about the lovely decor, he told me it was done by the same designer who did the George V. Just to set your expectations, the rooms are VERY small which is somewhat to be expected in Europe. My guess is that our room was about 10' x 12' + a small entrance hallway and bathroom. Our room had two very small wardrobes so pack light! We were thankful it was summer so our clothes weren't bulky. For us the room was fine because we just used it as a place to sleep. The rooms all have slightly different color themes, throws and softgoods but, for the most part they look exactly as pictured on their website. As previous posters have mentioned, there really isn't anywhere to put your suitcases. We stashed ours in the little alcoves in front of the two windows. For those who are traveling in the summer, the AC in this hotel is excellent! It's probably the best I've ever experienced at any hotel in Paris. Problem was, the 5 days we were there it was unseasonably cold so we didn't need it.An expanded continental bufftet breakfast is included with the rate. This includes juice, a variety of coffees  teas, yogurt, fruit, cereals, eggs, breakfast meat and potatoes. They also offer to cook omlets and eggs to order. In addition, they bring each table a basket of fresh breads and pasteries. Breakfast was served from 7-11am and I believe you can have it in your room as well? We never did this so I can't comment on what you get but I'd assume it's the same.The poster who said that cab drivers in Paris have no idea where the street is located, is correct. Our driver from the airport entered the address info into his GPS and he still couldn't find the hotel. I had printed a copy of the map from the hotels website and handed it to the driver and he still had trouble finding the street! Make sure you bring a map with you just in case the driver can't find it. I know our map helped the driver and he did eventually figure it out but the costs start to add up while he's driving around looking for the little side street.I know many people have RAVED about the staff at this hotel. They were fine but, I wouldn't go overboard raving about them. When asked, they will of course answer questions and make recommendations. I just didn't think they go out of their way to help. I know it's not the George V, but still. I have stayed at other hotels in Paris where the staff really did go out of their way to be friendly and helpful but, we didn't have the same experience as others have. To their credit however, they did make all our restaurant reservations, which was very helpful. My cell phone died earlier in the trip so I was not able to make my own dinner reservations. For the most part I knew what restaurants we planned to eat at so it was just a matter of the concierge phoning each restaurant. They also did make one very good restaurant recommendation---Marco Polo, a somewhat casual Italian Restaurant in the St Germain area. The restaurant was excellent and I'd go back in a heartbeat!This hotel is very central if you're a tourist. It's about a 5 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe  Champs Elysees and maybe 10 to 15 minutes to the Eiffel Tower. The hotel is located in the 16th Arrond but very close to the 8th. We also had an issue with housekeeping during our stay. The hotel encourages everyone to be green and reuse towels, which is fine. We used ours for 2 days and then put them in the tub to signal the housekeeper to replace them since my DH had come down with a cold. I was told by the housekeeping staff that there was a problem and they didn't have any bath towels. In lieu of the bath towels she gave me 2 hand towels! Later I ran into another housekeeper in the hall and she told me they still didn't have any towels. This went on for the remainder of our stay. So for 3 days we went without bath towels. Each day we'd come back to change for dinner, I'd look in the bathroom and there would be no bath towels. That got irritating. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. I personally am not in love with the location but, I knew that going into it. I'd be hard pressed to beat the price we paid thru GTAHOTELS so it made this hotel hard to pass up. I think anyone who stays here would overall be very pleased.

<Content>Beautiful Rooms, but housekeeping needs more monitoring We stayed at Hotel Keppler during our 4-day trip in Paris. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay in the hotel. The decor was wonderful, and the conceige and bell-boy are both very helpful. But, I do have a few things to point out:1. I had no soap in my bathroom until the last day of my stay. Not sure why that's the case, but I had to go hunt for a bar of soap on my first day in Paris2. One of the days, when the maid cleaned our room, she took all the towels that was on the floor and didn't replace them. However, when I called housekeeping for additional towels, they were delivered immediately.3. And I did discover some hair strand on the throw that does not belong to me, which is a bit disturbing. I understand the throw might be difficult to clean at times, and the dirt is quite noticable when the throw is white. But, I think the hotel should make an effort to clean the throws, especially when the customers are being charged a premium for the rooms.Other than that, the hotel has lived up to its reviews.

<Content>Did not disappoint Following lengthy research on the net and tripadvisor I decided on the Keppler and it did not disappoint. I took my mother for 2 days and the deluxe suite 601 was perfect, as the sliding doors between the main bedroom and the lounge area with a sofa bed preserved our privacy yet allowed us to enjoy our stay together when not asleep. Both areas had access to the terrace/balcony, which was spacious enough to accommodate a table and two chairs as well as a sun lounger affording a good view of the Eiffel Tower. The decor was beautiful and the bathroom small but cleverly designed and impressively equipped. Overall the room might have been a little on the small side, but it was so nicely furnished and clean, that it didn't matter. The hotel itself had very much the feel of a townhouse, so if you like the hustle and bustle and the facilities of a grand hotel, then this is not for you. But the staff here are wonderful, as mentioned by other reviewers, and for me another big advantage is its location. Close to the Champs Elysees and its metros yet in a quiet side street, which meant that one could relax and sleep undisturbed. I can thoroughly recommend this to anybody who doesn't care about pomp and ceremony but values service and understated elegance as well as a peaceful yet accessible location.

<Content>Fantastic staff make this one of the best hotels in Paris I recently spent a long weekend at the Keppler with my boyfriend, staying in a superior room. It was simply the best trip I have had anywhere in ages, thanks in no small part to the fantastic service at the Keppler. I certainly won't be trying out any other hotel in Paris any time soon.In the interests of full disclosure - a couple of things you should know about the hotel:* The rooms are small, even by Parisian standards. They are fine if you are planning to be out and about for most of the time (and why wouldn't you, this is Paris!), but there isn't much space to work for example, or sit down anywhere other than the bed.* Whilst our room was beautifully decorated and spotless, the design of the wardrobe doors isn't very smart. In a small space, a sliding door would have enabled good access to the wardrobe - instead it has folding doors which can't quite open because the bed is in the way.* Rue Kepler is a quiet side street and most taxi drivers don't have a clue where it is. Ask for Rue du Bassano, pres d'Avenue Marceau and Rue Kepler is on the right.Now for the main plus points (there are more, but the review would be too long):* The design is funky, but well thought through. There are comfortable places to sit in the common areas, with a mix of books and magazines in English, French and other languages.* Really good triple glazing in the rooms. You can't hear a thing outside when the windows are closed.* The bar is small and you wouldn't want to spend all evening there, but the cocktails are excellent. You almost feel like they are being made for you in your own front room.* Good breakfast by Parisian standards, and the breakfast room is light and welcoming (despite being sub-ground) thanks to a clever atrium/lightwell.* Even though the hotel was full when we stayed, we rarely saw other guests and there were no queues for reception on arrival or departure. Really felt like we were one of the only people at the hotel.* Finally and most importantly, the amazing staff. Nothing was too much trouble, whether it was finding us a reservation at a 2* Michelin restaurant for dinner, or recommending a day trip, or returning some lost property to us. Phillipe and Roman, in particular, could not have been more helpful or charming and really made the stay for us.

<Content>Lovely hotel in great location We have just returned from 3 nights at Hotel Keppler with our daughter having gone there to celebrate her 21st birthday. We had a very warm welcome including a surprise birthday present - quality toiletries and half bottle of champagne which was very much appreciated! We had the penthouse which is beautifully decorated with two bedrooms (one quite small but with a very large bed and the other with views of the Eiffel Tower), a lounge area and two excellent bathrooms. The mini TV screens in the bathroom mirrors were a real novelty. There were flatscreen TVs in each room plus a dvd, ipod speakers and internet access (for a charge). We found the penthouse very quiet and extremely comfortable with excellent beds. The whole hotel is wonderfully decorated, the breakfast was excellent (although not included) and the staff very helpful with good English. We only had one grumble, that we found it difficult to get a drink on our return each evening and when we did, it was very expensive! The ice machine was broken and we didn't even get lemon in our luke warm GT. The person on duty couldn't apparently open a bottle of wine so we gave up and resorted to the mini-bar which unfortunately hadn't been restocked! If the bar had been better we would certainly have given an excellent rating and we will definitely go back there if we return to Paris!

<Content>Thanks To All In The Keppler Team.... A heartfelt thanks to all the truly professional people working at the Keppler who helped to make our stay in Paris a truly memorable one.From the moment we walked through the door and discovered that the organisation through which we booked (Federal) had mysteriously cancelled our two rooms, we realised that we were in the hands of people who truly understand what hotel-keeping is really all about.Within a few minutes the problem was resolved (and it had nothing to do with the Keppler) and we were shown to our Standard rooms - which were way beyond what i would describe as 'standard'. Everything, apart from the size, is truly superb. If you really need lots of room, then book a suite.Whatever we asked for, from room service to help and advice on where to go and where to eat, was responded to with enthusiasm and expert knowledge - so refreshing for a city not known for such caring and hospitality.My only beef is that it is in a commercial area where not much is open in the immediate vicinity after around 11.00pm - although you don't have to walk too far to find it!The Keppler is one of Paris's real treasures, so thanks to all of the previous reviewers who encouraged us to make it our home from home.

<Content>Beautiful! This hotel is faultless. It is well located, really wonderfully decorated and extremely clean and all the staff are very polite and helpfull. The breakfast room is very pleasant and breakfast includes a wide and well presented variety of items. My sister I had a twin executive room with plenty of living and wardrobe space and a lovely bathroom with a tv integrated in the miror. The beds and pillows were very comfortable and the room was very quiet, ensuring a great sleep. The air conditioning was quiet and efficient. Turn down service was a nice touch.Overall we were extremely happy with this hotel, and we would recommend it to anyone who enjoys top quality.

<Content>BEST Hotel Just got back from a 10 day stay at the Keppler. This hotel is a real gem. It is beatifuly decorated and the service from all the staff is oustanding! They go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The hotel location is excellent and the hotel itself is spotless. Visiting Paris and staying at the Keppler was a 1st class experience.

<Content>Something different in Paris The Keppler Hotel is a unique boutique Hotel i discovered in searching Tripadvisor and am happy to advise almost all which has been said about the Hotel is correct.Staff are super friendly and are very welcoming.....a big Hi to Matthew and Roman at the Hotel (they do read the reviews!) and do pay attention to peoples comments which i find refreshing.Its location is wonderful just around the corner from the Champs Elysee and George the V shopping district.Breakfast is a delight and the staff will guide you to local restaurants,subway or any other needs.Tip...try Sardi an Italian restaurant not far from the Hotel......sensational!!!!!!and try Hotel Keppler,you will not be disappointed.....its french,its quirky,its a little Parisian secret for now!!!!Enjoy it before everyone else finds out about it.

<Content>Faultless! My husband and I have just come back from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Keppler and I felt compelled to write a review straight away, as it was simply suberb! The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. We booked a junior suite - the room was a good size, beautifully decorated and and the bed was the most comfortable we've ever had! Breakfasts were delicious and served in a very pretty room. The hotel's location was ideal, too - just a 5 minute walk from the metro and down the road from the Arc de Triomphe. All in all, we'd definitely stay there again if we ever go back to Paris (I hope so!). A GORGEOUS HOTEL!

<Content>Wonderful We booked the Hotel Keppler through Gta hotels and got a very good rate staying at the hotel for a long weekend. We could not fault this hotel at all. The staff were the most helpful and courteous I've ever known. The hotel is very chic with amazing decor and immaculate throughout. It was spotlessly clean. It doesn't have its own restaurant but provides breakfast and the dining area and food were lovely. The hotel is in a great location in Paris as just off the Champs Elysees. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic boutique hotel This hotel really is a little gem. The staff were fantastic, really friendly and always willing to help. The hotel decor was welcoming, with a very warm, homely feel to it. The lounge area and bar are a nice touch where you can enjoy a drink or sit and read. The hotel is very conveniently located, we walked or took the metro everywhere.The breakfast was great. A real good selection which set us up for the day. The standard room was a good size for a short break. The attention to detail makes this hotel stand out from any other hotels I have stayed at.Overall, a fantastic experience at the Keppler.

<Content>Good but a little too tiny We stayed at this hotel for only 3 days. It is very well located between the metro stations Etoile and George V.Keppler is a newly reburbished hotel, spotlessly clean, very charming with a very nice and helpful staff.Breakfast was excellent too.The only problem was that we had a classic room, that was very tiny, with no place even to put 1 suitcase.So I'd recommend staying at Keppler but getting a larger room.The your stay will be just perfect!!

<Content>What a wonderful hotel Have just returned fromi the Keppler Hotel after a 4 night stay. What a great hotel. The staff are so friendly and accommodating-nothing is too much trouble for them. The rooms are wonderfully decorated, even the lift walls are covered in wonderful fabrics. The breakfast room is also beautifully decoratted and the choice of breakfast food is second to none-absolutely great way to start the day. The hotel is ideally situated to most of the main sights in Paris-all within walking distance. The closest of course being the Arc de Triomphe-do try the Sir Winston Churchill pub just off the main road from the hotel to the Arc-a lovely place to have a quiet drink after sightseeing. I would certain ly recommend this hotel to anyone

<Content>We Join the Keppler Fan Club! We have just returned from a 4 night stay at Hotel Keppler. It is truly a top notch little hotel. The decor is lovely and inviting. Everything we experienced was impeccably clean. The breakfast room was a great way to start the day, with healthy choices as well as the usual treats. The staff is friendly, helpful and professional. Keep in mind that this hotel has been recently renovated so older reviews will reflect that. The only caveat we found is that standard rooms, though very comfortable, are small - if you have lots of luggage, you might find it a bit cramped. Otherwise, don't hesitate to experience this lovely hotel.

<Content>Superb Hotel and Location My Wife, daughter, son and I stayed in the Hotel Keppler for a long week-end in early February 2008. It is a truely beutiful, clean and well maintained Hotel in the heart of Paris, and within 3-4 minutes of the Champs Elysees. The staff are not only friendly and helpful but also immacuately dressed including the room staff. Lobby and restaurant staff all speak very good English, with nothing being too much trouble.The room is typically small, as with almost all Paris Hotels, but this is the centre of Paris and must be expected. However, any concerns over the room size is over-ridden by the opulance and luxury of the accommodation.Well worth the rates. we would certainly return to this Hotel on any future visits to Paris.

<Content>Loved Hotel Keppler Just returned from a 5 night stay at Hotel Keppler...loved it! The location is perfect - nestled in the Golden Triangle on a quiet street. Steps from Champs Elysee and walking distance to many good restaurants. This hotel is perfect for people like myself who do not enjoy large hotels but prefer smaller boutique hotels. The staff and service were fantastic. The hotel itself was just re-done in August and is completely new inside. The decor is very nice and rooms are very well appointed. I stayed in a Classic room which was perfect for myself however if travelling with my husband I would have found the room a bit small and would book an Executive room.Having stayed in many boutique hotels arond the world Hotel Keppler is one of my favorites. It is perfect for those travellers who are searching for service and luxury of a big 5 star hotel but prefer a more intimate ambiance.I would definitely return to this hotel on my next trip to Paris.

<Content>Parisian chic on a small scale I would recommend this hotel without hesitation to anyone who likes small boutique hotels. It's been recently refurbished to a very high standard and everything was spotless. The staff were very helpful and spoke good English.We stayed in a standard room which was very small, but thoughtfully laid out and decorated in a contemporary style.We were treated to a glass of champagne at the hotel bar on arrival which was a lovely touch. The breakfast was excellent. Good coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice, eggs, meats, cheeses, fruits and pastries served in a very light and airy basement room that has been beautifully decorated in fresh whites and greens.The hotel is two minutes walk from Champs Elysees and the George V metro stop. There a lots of restaurants nearby, but be warned that a lot of them are on the expensive side and quite formal. There's a great little wine bar nearby which does good food and cheese called Escluse.

<Content>Better than given rating I spent lots of time checking trip advisor hoping not to pick a duffer!!!! I have stayed in lots of hotels in Europe and must say more often than not I am disappointed in the standard in hotels. In my selection however I decided to take a chance in that I saw that it never had a very good rating but saw that it has recently been refurbed so thought I would take a chance as most comments were pre refurb. What can I say other than theses guys really know what they are doing.!!!!!! The room was excellent in fact better that some 5 star hotels that I'v stayed in. It was the standard of finish that got me no expense spared. Everything spotless and quality mattress, bedding and mirror in bathroom with built in plasma TV. I had an exec room but must say standard room was just as good just smaller.Breakfast again best I'v seen on a small scale. Very quiet side street but just 5 mins from centre.Staff friendly although English not as good across the board as expected or is that just Parisins?The style of the hotel may not be to everyones taste however you cant get away from the quality feel, and finish. paid approx 拢160 per night. Would highly recomend this Hotel just not Paris for a weekend break.

<Content>Hotel Keppler je t鈥檃ime Hidden away in a side street off Avenue Marceau lies Hotel Keppler; a trendy boutique hotel with real charm. My experience of Parisien hotels hasn鈥檛 always been the greatest but the Keppler changed all that. The hotel has been tastefully furnished and the d茅cor is extremely slick. Admittedly, the rooms are a tad on the small side but what they lack in size they make up for in quality. The bed was arguably the most comfortable hotel bed I鈥檝e ever slept in. Just what we needed after a hard day鈥檚 sight-seeing! The bathroom was again small but beautifully decorated and fully equipped with all the usual mod cons. Our one complaint was the lack of hot water from the shower.We鈥檇 booked on a bed and breakfast basis and the buffet spread was yummy. There was an endless supply of good French coffee, croissants and pastries and the chef was only too happy to whip up a couple of fried eggs upon our request.The staff at the Keppler were extremely accommodating especially when ordering taxis which can be notoriously scarce in Paris. Location wise the hotel is good. We鈥檙e not fans of the nearby Champs Elysees but it鈥檚 a five minute walk to George V on Line 1 or Kleber on Line 6 and in any case the Metro is so easy to use we hardly noticed.Overall, we鈥檇 definitely recommend the Hotel Keppler for any kind of stay in Paris after all this is the most beautiful city in the world!

<Content>Tres Chic and Petite A beautifully furnished hotel with wonderful service on a quiet street near the Arc de Triomphe. The renovation of htis hotel is a stunning success with each room completed with an exquisite level of finish. Its like staying in the beautiful apartment of a very wealthy Parisian friend who has amazing taste. Each room has very fine furnishings and fixtures/ The hotel two attached townhouses and so is quite small and intimate. The rooms are like most hotel rooms in Paris - quite small. The staff is exceptional. Coffee came to the room within minutes of ordering. Air France had lost my luggage for two days in the staff made exceptional efforts to recover the bags. I would enthusiastically recommend the Keppler to anyone who appreciates luxury, taste and exceptional service.

<Content>Wow! My 15yr old daughter  I have just returned from a four day stay in Paris and stayed at the Hotel Keppler. It is situated on a quiet street near the Arc-de-Triomphe  all I can say is - wow! The hotel had only just re-opened as a four star after a total refurbishment (was originally a two star I think) and the interior is absolutely amazing. Quality is the word that springs to mind upon entering. We had only booked a few days beforehand - I liked the look of the hotel  it's easy access to all the major Paris attractions via the Metro. We had a Standard room which was perfectly adequate in size for the two of us - there are larger rooms also available but at extra cost obviously. I'm sure the quality of the fittings etc in the Standard rooms are the same as these. The Suites look amazing - maybe one day!The staff were so friendly  helpful - nothing was too much trouble for them. As this was a special trip for my daughter (excellent exam results!) I had e-mailed beforehand to see if they could arrange for something to be put in the room as a surprise for her.The Reservations Manager got right back to me suggesting several things,  she introduced herself upon our arrival.The Chocolates I had chosen were in the room waiting, beautifully wrapped.Breakfast is either served in your room or in the Breakfast Room - (though there are also a couple of places nearby.)Sauna, Steam Room Gym too though we didn't check these out.Within a few minutes walk you are on the Champs Elysees  it's many amazing shops  restaurants - all in all an ideal base for exploring the rest of Paris. We will certainly be staying here again!
