<Content>A Wonderful Hotel We stayed for four nights in room number 4 and loved it. The room held up to our expectations from the photos on the hotel's website, it was beautifully furnished with antiques, expensive carpets and curtains. The room was very cosy and had a wonderful atmosphere so that we enjoyed every minute we spent in it. The staff was very friendly, helpful and professional and the location of the hotel was superb.

<Content>Wonderful Stay We loved our stay at this hotel. Our room was beautifully furnished with antique furniture and had a wonderful view of the canal. Lovely fresh flaky croissants, pastries and fruit were carried up to our room every morning so that we could eat breakfast at a table by the window and watch the life in the street below. A fantastic experience. The management were friendly and anxious to help and everything was very clean.

<Content>Highly Recommended We have been very remiss in writing this review. Our stay in January was the 4th time we stayed at the Seven Bridges. We had a slight problem on arrival and Gunther  Pierre were most helpful in resolving it. We were enjoying our stay so much that we extended it by several days. I've stayed at other small hotels in Amsterdam and none of them came close to matching the charm and space. I wouldn't recommend the Seven Bridges to everyone, and neither would the owners. The stairs are steep and you have to carry your own bags. If you are someone who overpacks or isn't able to climb stairs, you might want to consider somewhere else. If you can get past this then this is the place to stay. I can't recommend it enough. Great location. Fabulous breakfast served in your room!

<Content>Best way to experience Amsterdam hospitality I recently stayed for three nights in room 8. The room faced the garden with two very comfortable beds, antique furniture for closet/storage space and a very clean bathroom. They had a towel heating rack in the bathroom and adjustable heater in the room so we were never cold or too hot. I can't remember the number of TV channels available but definitely more English channels than just CNN or BBC news.I really loved the breakfast served in room. The croissants were still hot when we received them and the bananas/oranges were great mid-morning snack to take with us for later. They served awesome coffee as well. All in all, it was way better than the normal continental breakfast you get at typical European hotels.I also loved the fact that the hotel was not right on a tram line or a tram stop, it's in a really quiet area. It was a great place to relax after walking around all day. Amsterdam is definitely made for walking or biking! We walked to most of the sights, and the only time we really took the tram was when we went to Centraal station.

<Content>Loved Seven Bridges Hotel We loved this perfect hotel in an old canal house on a centrally located quiet side street. We could walk to everything. The proprietors couldn't have been more considerate and welcoming. They gave us an extremely helpful map that got us oriented right away on this our first trip to Amsterdam. The room was quiet and beautiful and cozy at the very top of the house under the eaves, overlooking the pretty gardens, with comfortable colorful furnishings and a nice bathroom with towels that were especially wonderful since they were heated on their racks. The breakfasts served in the room (and whose arrival we were thoughtfully forewarned about 5 - 10 minutes in advance by phone) were spectacular and huge--multiple kinds of warm breads, fruits, yogurts, ham and cheese, and coffee or tea served in a china pot, all on china dishes. We borrowed a hotel laptop free of charge once or twice too when we needed to reconnect with the real world. The only people I wouldn't recommend the hotel to are people with disabilities because the steps are steep (but then again, we were at the very top), as they are in all real canal houses. Seven Bridges is a real gem and we'd stay there again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Excellent Location! We had a wonderful stay at the Seven Bridges. The location is excellent and it is in a very beautiful part of Amsterdam. We arrived early due to an overnight flight from Boston but were given instructions on a breakfast place and various things that we might want to do until the room was ready. It worked out great. The food at the coffee shop was very good.Just a note on getting to the Inn from the airport. We took the train and then a tram. Overall, very easy. When you get to the main train station, you need look for the right tram area, there are a few main tram areas. There is an information desk at the Train Station that was very helpful. And, might be good to talk to them first before going out to try to find your tram on your own.Our room, Garden Room 4, was very compact but beautifully furnished. As mentioned, the breakfast arrives each morning with lots of breakfast goodies. The staff were always helpful with directions, cabs and wake-up calls.We loved it here and hope to return soon!Randall  Maureen

<Content>Great Place and Location Had a room 6 overlooking the canal. Aside from some scaffolding being set up outside our window on our last morning, the stay was perfect. Easy to get around town both walking and with the trams. Breakfast was served on a large tray each morning and we enjoyed the canal view while eating in or PJ's Will definitely go back on my next trip to Amsterdam. I travel there at least three times a year and this was one of the best experiences we have had with a hotel.

<Content>Wow - Believe the reviews, they are spot on !!! Just returned from this wonderfully friendly and well situated hotel and now I can see why it has consistently been awarded great reviews on here. We booked Apartment B which is a couple of doors away from the main hotel and found it to be very clean and comfy and overall great value for money - Amsterdam hotels are, in my experience, generally overpriced and somewhat 'tatty'.Situated overlooking a delightfully quiet canal but within strolling distance of all the main attractions including Rembrandtplein, Leidseplein, and the Jordaan we walked everywhere and at the end of a long day sightseeing and people watching we were really happy to get back to our apartment and relax in almost decadent comfort surrounded by quality furnishings and a very comfortable bed. Tea, coffee etc all inlcuded and well stocked and a very useful fridge for our croissants and wine which sort of helped bearing in mind the exchange rate at the moment.Believe the hype - this place is fabulous!!!!!

<Content>Great little hotel This hotel is perfect for the traveller who enjoys hotels that are a bit different. The Seven Bridges is ideally situated near enough to the centre of Amsterdam for easy access, but also far away enough from the crowds. We enjoyed our lovely breakfasts brought to our room, and managed to survive the climb up 3 flights of steep stairs without getting too much out of breath! The room was lovely and the bed very comfortable. There are good restaurants and cafes nearby.

<Content>Great small hotel My son and I have just returned from a two night break in Amsterdam. It was a most enjoyable short break made all the better by staying at the Seven Bridges. A lovely small hotel right on the canal. We stayed in Room 8 - a large room on the second floor with two double beds. We had a small but perfectly adequate en suite shower room. Breakfast, as mentioned previously, is brought up into your bedroom. It is just like all the photos - too much to eat - but delicious!!! The hotel is in a great position near the Rembrantsplein. There are plenty of restaurants and coffee shops nearby. However, it only takes a few minutes by tram to get right into the centre. A fabulous hotel - would highly recommend. The owners are honestly some of the nicest people we have ever met! Couldn't do enough for you. Even lent us a laptop to check our emails. You will have a guaranteed great stay.

<Content>Fantastic Find I've had the most wonderful holiday in Amsterdam, thanks in great part to the wonderful proprietors at the Seven Bridges Hotel. Gunter,Pierre and Eric are exceptional innkeepers. There hotel is truly a rare gem. From check in to check out they made every step of my stay truly a vacation! From securing opera tickets, to suggesting excellent restaurants and making dinner reservations to assisting with navigating the public transportation, they do it ALL and with a smile! In addition the accomodations are terrific, well located and lovely. The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance from just about everything that one would care to see. It is a charming traditional house laden with lovely antique furnishings replete with beautiful modern bathrooms. What more could one ask for?I can't wait to return and wouldn't think of staying anywhere else.

<Content>Exceeds High Expectations on all Counts Location - Service - Style - Value The Seven Bridges succeeds on all counts!Location - On a quiet canal just outside of the heart of the city. All of the great attractions are within walking distance. And when you need it, a choice of trams are only a block away. Fine dining and the cuisines of the world are plentiful within two blocks in any direction.Service - The three hosts go the extra mile to make sure your stay is special. Need a restaurant recommendation or reservation - need directions - need an extra umbrella - all done with class. It was a real treat each morning to have breakfast delivered to our room at a time of our chosing - fresh, warm, and plentiful - served on lovely china which changed each day. Style - You reserve for a specific room at the Seven Bridges. We had Garden Room 4 - at the quieter back on the same level as reception. Our collegues were in Rooms 8 and 10 - up two and three flights. Fair warning - there is no lift and the stairs are steep and winding. Our room exceeded our expectations - comfortable foam mattress and lovely furnishings. Value - 140 Euro including breakfast for terrific accomodations and service. As good as it gets in Amsterdam.We loved our six night stay at the Seven Bridges and will not hesitate to return if we get the opportunity.

<Content>Lovely Place We stayed at the Seven Bridges for two nights. This small hotel is located in a quieter section of the city along a canal. We had room 7 which has a canal view. Saturday night can be a little noisy as there is a Coffee Shop two doors down. The horses also go up and down the cobbled streets to add to the noise but Sunday was quiet. The stairs are a steep spiral so luggage and could be a problem for some. The breakfast is traditional European breakfast of breads, coffee, cheese, coldcuts, etc. and is very, very plentiful. The rooms are well furnished with antiques and comfortable beds. The hosts are very helpful. They stored our luggage early in the morning and provide us with maps and location for sighseeing. I have no problem in recommending this small hotel (and I am a 5*+ traveller).

<Content>not for everyone If you don't want a good location on a pretty, quiet canal, generous breakfasts brought by friendly hosts to your spacious high-ceilinged room (#5) and large bathroom with a shower that meets husband's high standards of spray and temperature, then this isn't the place for you. Only people wanting perfect decor and communal breakfasts to meet fellow travelers will be disappointed. We actually ended up in the same room we enjoyed 10 years ago.Advice we could have used: if your taxi from the train station tries to charge 20 euros, report his number to your hosts. It shouldn't be more than about 12 euros.

<Content>The best vacation ever! My husband and I just returned from a week at Seven Bridges. This has to be the best hotel in Amsterdam! Gunther and Pierre were most gracious of hosts in this wonderful canal house located in a picture perfect setting. Each morning they would bring a breakfast to our room that included cheese, meats, fruits, yogurt, orange juice, coffee and very fresh croissants and assorted breads. The rooom was spacious and decorated with great care. This was the best vacation ever and we hope that we will be able to return soon.

<Content>A fantastic Experience The Seven Bridges Hotel offered everything that I was looking for and a LOT more! This was my first trip to Amsterdam and with the help of Gunther and Eric, it was like traveling with our own personal guides! The location was perfect - right in the center of the canal district and easy walking to all of the museums and public transportation. The hotel was spotlessly clean and extremely comfortable. Gunther and Eric were more than willing to answer any questions and they even researched the opera performances, made great dinner recommendation (and even made reservations for us) and guided us through all of the points of interests with great directions on how to get there. I hope to return to Amsterdam and I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else. They made us feel completely at home and comfortable.What a wonderful adventure and a perfect travel experience!Jennifer AriesPhoenix, Arizona

<Content>An Amsterdam Gem When some think of Amsterdam their first thought might be their favorite restaurant, coffee bar, museum or district. When I think of Amsterdam my first thought is the Seven Bridges Hotel. Without question this special place made my trip. It is located in a quite street just outside of the heart and soul of the city. Everything is within walking distance and for those longer treks the tram (which is so easy to use) is one block away. There are more than enough fine dinning restaurants and other famous Amsterdam establishments just a stones throw away. The hotel itself offers many wonderful characteristics. First, the hosts Pierre and Gunter, will make sure your stay is comfortable and to your satisfaction. Each morning breakfast is delivered to your room at your desired time. The breakfast was always fresh, warm, and plentiful. You have your choice of rooms at the Seven Bridges. We had room four and eight. Both rooms were above our expectations in comfort, d茅cor, and ambiance. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting an authentic and memorable place to stay. The stairs are steep but most people would find this aspect of the hotel to be unique. The stairs were not a problem for us and we had to haul two 50lb bags up the stairs for our business meeting. This was my second trip to Amsterdam and by far the best. I felt as though I could not ask for anything more out of a hotel and its hosts. The Seven Bridges is they only place I will ever stay in Amsterdam and I am already planning a return trip soon.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel! We stayed at the 7 Bridges Hotel the first part of September 2008 and had an absolutely wonderful stay! Real Simple magazine recommended the hotel in their Travel Guide and I am so thankful I read the article and decided to stay here. This was our first trip to Amsterdam and we were able to take the train and a tram to the hotel without any trouble. The hotel is in a great location to walk and sightsee and the restaurant on the corner has great food. We were on our way to a Mediterranean cruise and I forgot to print my husband's boarding pass and Gunter saved the day by printing one for me at 8:30pm. He also called a taxi for us and we had a nice visit before we left at 6:00am the following morning. The bed was very comfortable in Room 6, it is a new bed and we slept very well! The morning breakfast was an added treat as we had traveled from Washington State and were trying to get over jet lag and we felt like we were in heaven with the food and coffee delivered to the room. I can't say enought to recommend this hotel......we will definitely return!

<Content>The Best Hotel! We were in Amsterdam at the middle of September and choose Seven Bridges Hotel based on its rating at TripAdvisor. It is really great hotel!!! First of all we were met very polite. We booked room no. 10 for 9 days; it is beautiful, cosy room at the last floor of the hotel, so there are many windows at the ceiling and sunny light fill the room completely. The room furnished very nice and comfortable. There are many lamps (on walls, on tables) and at the evening it looks romantic. Room was cleaning every morning, every day we have clean towels, new bed-clothes. Breakfast was very tasty and big, so we sometimes couldn鈥檛 eat it at all! Gunter and Pierre are very responsive and nice people. At the end of our trip Gunter kindly called taxi for us.We enjoy conversation with them and I was surprised heard that Gunter unpolite. I think that it was really some misunderstanding. I recommend this hotel to all!Thank you very much again and again for amazing atmosphere you created for us!

<Content>Highly recommend this very small hotel! For our first visit to A'dam in many years, we were delighted with this conveniently located, quiet, very small but elegant hotel. Room #4 on the first level - overlooking the peaceful rear garden - is quite spacious with beautiful furnishings. The bed was quite comfortable; the bathroom also comfortable, with a very good shower. Breakfasts were sumptuous (if unvarying). Hosts were friendly and kind, but not obtrusive. All in all, the price was very reasonable. We're rather fussy but definitely recommend this and plan to stay there in future.

<Content>Absolutely perfect Our stay in Seven Bridges Hotel was absolutely perfect! The hotel is very nice, situated on lovely canals probably in the most beautiful part of Amsterdam which is calme but at the same time very close to the centre of Amsterdam. Rooms are very pretty equipped (we had the room n掳10 with nice view to the garden). All the staff is very pleasant and helpful with everything you need! Breakfast is very rich, delicious and served to your room. We recommend Seven Bridges Hotel to all travellers who want to visit Amsterdam and who want to have a lovely accomodation in this beautiful city. Once, we would like to return to Amsterdam and of course to Seven Bridges Hotel.Katherine from Prague

<Content>Unpolite manager I strongly do not recommend to stay in a place, where the manager don't believe in the quality of his own hotel. I try to book a room in the Seven Bridges Hotel and after some emails conversations, I ask Gunter to inform me about the details I was supposed to forward him to make the reservation, but he refused to inform, saying the the only room avaible should not attend my expectation. All this happened because it would be my first trip to Europe (i am from Brazil) and I mde some questions about the room, trying not to dissapoint my wife.

<Content>Excellent place to stay This hotel is the best way to stay in Amsterdam. It's a house, traditional in style and right by some of the most attractive canals in the city. It's got everything - character, quiet area, close to attractions, close to places to eat (including Rembrandtsplein/square). So you can get to everything easily - but you can also escape the bustle of the city and feel like you're a resident there for your stay. The hospitality of the owners is excellent too. They are friendly and helpful - and even call you when breakfast is about to be brought to your room. The breakfast is a large mix of breads, cheese, meat, croissants and fruit. I really can't falt this hotel - it has to be one of the best in the city if you want character places with the feeling of being in a traditional setting right be the canalside.

<Content>Quiet Hotel, Great Location This is a nice hotel in a great location. The hosts are very friendly and accommodating. We stayed in room 6 which overlooks the canal. The bed is a very low platform bed, which didn't bother us but might be a problem for some. What did bother us was the very firm mattress which we aren't used to. You should also be advised that the stairway is quite steep. The room had no wash cloths or facial tissues, but the hosts were generous with toiletries. The hosts made several restaurant recommendations in the area, but we weren't especially pleased by any until our third day when we ate at Le Pecheur located at Reguliersdwarsstraat 32. It was excellent and prices were reasonable. With regard to Amsterdam restaurants, we suggest you ignore the guidebooks and avoid The Pancake Factory. The pancakes are NOT like crepes. They are the size of pizzas, are thick and greasy, and are not done. You will love the city.

<Content>Loved It! We returned to this hotel having stayed there back in 2006, and it's just as magnificant as before! We stayed in room 9, which is up lots of really steep stairs, but is well worth the climb. The view of the canal is beautiful and the room is filled with stunning antiques - absolutely superb. Everyone who works there was lovely, yet completely unobtrusive. The huge continental breakfast is served in the room, and they even give you a call to let you know when it's coming. The area is beautiful and very quiet compared to the rest of the city. There was occasionally a bit of shouting from revellers outside, but it wasn't too bad and the ear plugs - thoughtfully provided by the hotel - did the job nicely! I absolutely love this place and can't wait to return as soon as I possibly can!

<Content>Seven Bridges is a Real Gem We recently had the pleasure of being in Amsterdam and staying at the very classy, yet understated, Seven Bridges Hotel. Our proprietors were very, very gracious and our rooms (my husband and I had room 8, our teenage boys had room 5) were absolutely perfect with fresh flowers, antique furniture, a patio and garden and a very modern bathroom. We were served a delicious breakfast every morning in our room (every day the China on which it was served was of a different pattern!) and found the location excellent. Both of our rooms faced the gardens and were quiet but honestly, the canal side was quiet too. We were just a quick walk to a tram stop and found restaurants and shopping very accessible too. I hesitate to write this review because I would like this hotel to be kept a secret, but our hosts are so deserving of this accolade that I must let others know about this gem of a place.Cathy

<Content>Loved the Seven Bridges We stayed at the Seven Bridges Hotel for a long weekend getaway. Its location couldn't be any more perfect, situated in the heart of the Golden Bend. We purchased the I Am Amsterdam card and the tram stop is just a minute away from the hotel. But if you prefer to travel on foot, Seven Bridges is in close proximity to pretty much everything. Plus, who could resisit a romantic walk along these beautiful canals in Amsterdan. As for the room, we stayed in Room #6, directly facing the canal. The owner was worried that we may find it noisy, but we had absolutely no complaints. It was pleasantly quiet. The room decor is just as described  photographed at their website. I haven't seen other rooms in person, but our room is exactly (100%) as described in website. Very charming, clean  lovely. Speaking of website, the hotel does not do any online/internet booking. One must contact them directly. They are extremely good at getting back to inquiries/bookings. Very smooth process. Overall, our experience at the Seven Bridges was great. For those of you from North American, I would not call it a Hotel as it lacks the amenities one often associates with a hotel. It is more like a Bed  Breakfast. An EXCELLENT one. Way better than staying at a hotel, unless you want the gym, pool, concierage, room service, restaurant....the whole nine yards. But those of you looking for quaint private places that is quiet enough yet conveniently located, this is the place to you. And I almost forgot about the breakfast they served. Portion was very generous and certainly enough to prepare for all the walks in the city. Peaceful. Quaint.

<Content>Oh yes its perfect. This is the only hotel we have ever stayed at that made us feel like leaving a review. My partner and I would just like to say how romantic this special little hotel makes you feel. So if its a romantic break you are looking for with an authentic dutch feel then you will not be disappointed. We can both honestly say that the hotels location is perfect for both shopping, sight seeing,or just people watching from the comfort of your room. So all you need to do now is pick the right room. We opted for Room C and it was brilliant in every way.

<Content>Loved the Seven Brides Hotel! We stayed at the lovely Seven Bridges Hotel in Amsterdam in June. We had two rooms, one for our two teenagers and one for my husband and me. The hotel is absolutely lovely, just a few blocks from Rembrandt plaza, so near the center of town, but on a quiet, beautiful street.The rooms are beautiful, clean and comfortable. Our room overlooked the canal and our kids' room overlooked a garden. Breakfast was delicious and very, very generous and was served to us in our rooms, as there is no separate dining room. The owner asked us what time we liked breakfast, then called us each morning about five minutes before he brought breakfast upstairs to make sure we were ready for it.We really loved the location; it's not near the crazy Dam Square, but we could walk there in 15 minutes. I much preferred the area we were. We walked everywhere.

<Content>You can't go wrong! One of the best features of Seven Bridges is its location. Within about two blocks, you can find anything you need, from restaurants, to tram stops, to coffeeshops. It's especially nice for first-time visitors who will be roaming all over the city and need a centrally-located home base that's easy to get to from any of the main sights.The owners are very sweet and attentive. The complimentary breakfast (brought up to your room!) is wonderful, with juice, coffee, tea, meat, cheese, fruit, yogurt, and a variety of breads. We could never finish the whole thing, so we usually saved the bananas for eating while out exploring later in the day.The cleaning service was always great. Even the bathmat was changed daily, with a different color every day! Little touches like this made it clear that the owners really cared about what they were doing, adding to the overall charm of the place.The free wireless internet was a blessing. It was great being able to spend downtime over breakfast and before bed keeping in touch with friends and family and searching the internet for information about the next day's adventures in Amsterdam.We stayed five nights in room 10, the Garden Room, which was incredibly quiet. We were amazed at just how peaceful the room was. Even during Holland's string of wins in Euro 2008, with excited football fans in local bars just a block or two away, we were never disturbed. Some of the canal-view rooms might be a bit noisier just because they overlook the street, but the street always seemed very quiet, so noise is certainly not a problem in the hotel, and especially not in the Garden Room.The room itself was small, but not uncomfortably so. It's perfectly-sized for a single or couple who don't plan on spending all day in the room (which you shouldn't be doing in Amsterdam anyway!). There is a little nook for doing work out of sight of the bed, which came in very handy when one of us wanted to sleep while the other needed to use the computer.The only negatives are incredibly minor. The breakfast table in the room was too small for the huge breakfast, but using the bed as extra table space worked fine. As others have noted, and as is true for many hotels in Amsterdam, the staircase is very small and tightly spiraled. You will have a lot of difficulty if you bring bulky or heavy bags. Pack light, and you'll be much happier, both in this hotel and in general.Overall, this is a great hotel, well worth the expense. You won't regret staying here, and you'll want to stay again on your next visit.

<Content>The best place to stay in Amsterdam A friend and I stayed in room 8 at The Seven Bridges Hotel from June 6th - June 10th. We did not arrive until June 7th due to issues with Ryan Air (AVOID AT ALL COSTS!), but Gunter held our room and welcomed us into the hotel on Saturday morning. As indicated in previous reviews the staircase is almost vertical with very thin steps. Room 8 is exactly as the photo's detail - very large enough for two people and full of antiques. The bath/shower was nice and clean. A great breakfast was delivered each morning to our room - you just let Gunter know what time you would like breakfast and it will be delivered - they are even nice enough to give a courtesy call to the room asking if they could bring up the food in ten minutes. The hotel location is perfect! The hotel itself sits just to the south of Rembrandt Plein (Square) - which is full of restaurants, cafes and a few coffeeshops. Next to the hotel is Barney's Lounge (One of the several Barney's locations around the city). They are open from 10:00am - 01:00am daily. They serve a great cup of coffee and have a very nice cannabis menu - and it's a great place to start and end the day. Many thanks to Andy for all of his great advice.When traveling to Amsterdam I would HIGHLY suggest picking up a I amsterdam card from the tourist information building located outside of Amsterdam Central Station. The card is good for 24, 48 or 72 hours and get's you free travel on Amsterdam trams and buses, free parking for your car, and free entry to most Amsterdam museums (Anne Frank House not included) - plus two free canal cruises. I will be making annual pilgrimages from now on and will spend each holiday at Seven Bridges Hotel. Many thanks to you Gunter and your staff for a wonderful stay. See you next year.

<Content>Absolutely Excellent! A mistake to stay anywhere else. I have been to Amsterdam many times, but for this trip I wanted something really special and happenstance led me to this site and the Seven Bridges! I have never been happier with a European hotel. Everything about it was great, including the location, the hotel and of course, the service. My girlfriend fell in love with the place as soon as she saw it . Together we have stayed in hostels, hotels and campsites throughout Europe, USA and Canada... but she was most impressed with this hotel. It is a warm, welcoming place and we both felt at home from the moment we entered the lobby. The flowers smelled wonderful, the breakfast was beyond expectations and worth every Euro. The room we stayed in (Number 10) was cozy, quiet, romantic and felt more like our own apartment than a hotel. I have stayed at the Peabody in Memphis, the Mariott in nyc and the Queen Elizabeth in Montreal, but the hotel I look most forward to staying at again is The Seven Bridges in Amsterdam. Don't miss it !

<Content>Wonderful home away from home Stayed at the Seven Bridges on recent trip to Amsterdam. It was a memorable and wonderful experience. The rooms were lovely; nice breakfast; great location - near many of the top sites and yet quietly tucked away on a not so well trodden canal street.Service was outstanding and made us feel that we were truly home. Very difficult to leave at the end.

<Content>Stay in a wonderful Canalside "House" If you want to live like a local in a canalside house in Amsterdam then this is the place to stay. Wonderful location on Reguliersgracht, close to Rembrandt Plein, walking distance to all Amsterdam attractions. Our room was very big, en-suite bathroom, outside patio, furnished with wonderful antiques. Ample breakfast delivered to the room in the mornings. Manager/Owner was very helpful and friendly. Will stay there again any day!

<Content>best b my wife  i stayed in room #4, adult kids stayed in #8 for 5 nights each...room #4 is ground floor, for those who would rather not climb steep steps...the rooms were as advertised, in beautiful antiques...this was the cleanest, quietest bb we have ever stayed in,  we've been to a lot...besides the owners being terrific, the location cannot be beat...central to everything in amsterdam, right on the quietest, prettiest canal...when (not if) we go back to amsterdam will definitely stay at the 7 bridges...

<Content>LovelyHotel! We booked this hotel on the strength of a review in the Daily Telegraph which gave it high praise, and we weren't disappointed: I phoned the hotel direct and spoke to the charming and helpful Gunter, and although it was at fairly short notice, he was able to offer us a room for a reasonable price. Although this room is the smallest in the hotel and does have a very small bathroom (which both Gunter and the website are very up-front about), it was both charming and comfortable. The bathroom IS small, but is perfectly adequate for a short stay, and has everything one could need and was spotlessly clean. When we arrived (by motorcycle), I was unsure about the parking situation, but Richard kindly (and without my asking) phoned the police to clarify the regulations and it was quickly sorted out. Excellent service indeed!Nicely appointed rooms, Excellent location, superb breakfast, friendly and helpful staff - all the ingredients needed for a top hotel. Highly recomended!Q  R Jaume

<Content>My Amsterdam Hotel The hotel has many things going for it that made our stay there unique and special. First was location, the hotel is located on the canals just out of the main tourist area. In 5-10 minutes you can WALK to the tulip markets and many other of the main tourist attractions (even faster if you take the trams), but the hotel is just far enough out of the busy area to have quiet at night. Secondly, the service is amazing. Every morning the small staff, walk up several flights of stairs to deliver breakfast trays to your room. With only eight or so rooms, the service you get is really personalized. The hotel had no problem accommodating my husband's dietary restrictions or our late arrival. The greatest part about Seven Bridges is the unique experience of staying in a very tastefully decorated 300 year old canal house. I stayed in canal facing Room 9 at the top of three flights of very steep stairs. After I caught my breath the view was amazing. Just being able to wake up and sip my tea while watching boats pass on the canal and locals ride by on their bicycles gave me a taste of what it might be like to live in there. Unique experiences like that you just can't find at big chain hotels.

<Content>comfortable accommodations with wonderful staff If you are looking for accommodations in Amsterdam, look no further. Seven Bridges is comfortable, safe, quiet and serves a lovely breakfast. My husband and I stayed there for 4 nights and were just delighted with the room. We stayed in room 8 and it was perfect for our needs. This hotel is conveniently located for seeing all the sights. I can't say enough about this hotel and the staff. Thanks!!!

<Content>Every hotel should be like this one. This is a wonderful, little hotel - just the kind of place we love to find when we travel. It is intimate, spotless, well-designed and in a great location.We stayed in Room 6 which is decorated in antiques with contemporary touches. It has a lovely view of the Canal and homes across the street. The breakfasts are fantastic. Breads, yogurt, fruit, ham, cheese, coffee. We had enough left over for lunch.We highly recommend this hotel and wish we could similar places in all our travels.

<Content>Yes, Seven Bridges really is that wonderful! I just got back last night from 4 nights at the Seven Bridges - and I simply have to add to the choir praising this absolutely charming place! I had found the hotel on Tripadvisor and was frankly a little bit sceptical - the rave reviews sounding almost too good to be true. But from the first moment all the fuss turned out to be fully justified. We arrived late at night and were warmly greeted in the reception. Our room was made cosy for our arrival with the door opened for us and the lights turned on. We couldn't have felt more welcome! We had been lucky to get the last available room, which they almost made excuses for - small, having no view etc. - when we booked. So we expected something rather basic. But it turned out to be a lovely, cosy and very tastefully decorated room with a soothing garden view of trees and blue sky - giving a calming feeling of being in a green oasis in the middle of the city. I have rarely felt this much at home in a hotel.And we had more pleasant surprises in store: The next morning a delicious breakfast was served in our room - warm croissants, freshly pressed orange juice, fruit etc. etc. Everything arranged on beautiful china, with a new style every day. We felt absolutely pampered!Leaving the hotel the next morning to explore the city we realised, that not only is the hotel in itself a small gem - but on top of that the location has to be hands-down the best in Amsterdam. After 4 days of walking all over the city we never found an area exactly this picturesque and romantic, authentic and charming as Reguliersgracht around Herensgract and Keizersgracht!I cannot recommend the Seven Bridges enough!

<Content>What a wonderful hotel My husband and myself and our two 20 year old daughters stayed here several nights. What a special place, in the perfect location-on the canal, within walking distance to great restaurants, museums and all the attractions. We stayed in room 5, which was huge and had a large bathroom. My girls stayed in room 7 which overlooked the canal. Breakfast was brought to our room each morning and the the staff was delightful. What a wonderful alternative to larger hotels. It really gave us a local dutch experience that still incorporated the elegance we love. Try it, you won't be dissappointed!

<Content>It's all true! I don't want to repeat what others have said but just to corroborate, it's all true. It's a beautiful house. Breakfast is abundant and delicious and served in your room at the time of your choice. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The staircase is daunting, yes! But it is worth the trip upstairs. It is a different place, not the usual chain hotel. Towels and bedsheets are clean but do not smell like bleach. Furniture is made of antiques. Everything about the place is unique and it is located in the most beautiful neighborhood in Amsterdam. I would go back in a heartbeat!

<Content>5* Budget Hotel for Ambiance Chasers... Is the Seven Bridges Hotel really better than the Amstel Hotel? Well...considering that a week's stay at the Seven Bridges is about the cost of one (two at the most) night's stay at the Amstel, the answer is an unequivocal yes! The properties of course are not comparable...One is a budget hotel...priced nearly as low as any in the Canal Ring...the other a true 5 Star, but value is a truly important consideration when deciding on lodging. For your $1,200 or so per night at the Amstel, one gets great public spaces...people flocking around serving you...and the opportunity to have a $500,000 Chopard watch delivered to your room.For your $1,200 or so at the Seven Bridges, you get about a week in a cool little Canal House, well located and well decorated with antiques, complimentary modern pieces and oriental rugs. An abundant breakfast is brought to your room on lovely China...all adding to the charming ambiance of the hotel.The peaceful Garden Room 4 was our home for the week of March 27-April 4, 2008 and the only complaint I have is that the table is a bit low. I twice bumped the edge with my long legs, spilling some coffee during the abundant breakfast. Covered with glass, cleanup was easy. That's it...a bit of my clumsiness is the largest finding of fault...This little gem of a place is exactly as advertised...a sparkling clean, calm and beautiful retreat for the independent traveler. Hotel doesn't quite seem the correct word; but it's not a BB either...It's a labor of love shared by the proprietors for those willing to go through the process to book a room here. The lack of amenities (no elevator, public rooms, bar, etc) are OK considering that Barney's Lounge (Mint tea, milkshakes...and.) is a stumble outside the front door...and the ample dining options (Tempo Doeloe, Mujah Taret, Alfonso's and more) on Utrechtstraat are also just a short stroll...as is Rembrandtplein and its tremendous selection of eateries and little food shops. Their website perfectly captures the essence of the hotel...and needs to be examined in detail before deciding to stay here. The interior stairs are steep, no doubt about it, but Garden 4 is on the entry level...removing that concern. Garden 5, up one flight, is easily one of the nicest rooms you'll find anywhere...and the room's private terrace is a great place to take breakfast during pleasant weather. The Seven Bridges Hotel is a quiet and tremendously refined slightly upscale budget hotel with limited services. It is not an acceptable lodging for those that need to be watched over or have their every question answered, although they will assist their guests however possible. We loved it...and recommend it highly to those that find it appealing.

<Content>Loved the Seven Bridges Hotel My husband and I just returned from a 6 night stay at the Seven Bridges Hotel and loved it. We stayed in room in room 10 which is on the top floor and found it cozy and charming and loved all of the sunlight from the skylights. Breakfast was terrific and abundant-- we were very impressed with the effort of the owners in carrying it up all of the steps to our room. The location is fantastic-- situated on a beautiful canal and in easy walking distance to everything. Overall, an intimate beautiful hotel with owners who clearly care a lot about what they do.

<Content>What a great find My sister, friend and I spent 3 nights at this gorgeous hotel. We stayed in antique-filled room 5, which is quite beautiful and even has it's own little terrace. The hosts were really charming too. The position is great. In fact, so pretty that it was being used for a film location during our stay. We'll definitely be making a return visit.

<Content>A Gem in Amsterdam!! Our first trip out of the USA resulted in our staying at the a delightful hotel in Amsterdam. Seven Bridges was very quiet in a busy city. Some mornings the only noise was the birds communicating with each other. We had Canal view #9 and Garden View #3. Please see their website, they are not kidding about the steps. However on our arrival a nice young man took our luggage up the stairs two at a time!! We figured the steps were good exercise, so we could eat more!The view from the room was very nice with the bridges and the canal. Nice location since we were visiting our daughter at University of Amsterdam. Close to the tram and most things were walking distance. The room were very nice. Breakfast was not just a donut and coffee but bread, fresh fruits, juice, cheese and turkey and yogart (loved the yogart!) Delivered to your room on beautiful china. I'm not going to find this at home...The staff was very accommodating and pleasant. They helped us to get a taxi and 6:30 am on Easter morning with not problem.

<Content>Fantastic! I read about this unique hotel on TripAdvisor and wanted to confirm the high reviews as well as strongly recommend this accomodation to Amsterdam travelers. My husband and I stayed 6 nights at the 7 Bridges and felt very at home. It is spotlessly clean, comfortable, and an authentic Dutch canal house. The food was delicious and the hosts were helpful and made us feel at home in Amsterdam. In addition to the wonderful hotel, the location is wonderful...close to everything, but quiet and picturesque. Every restaurant we tried in the are was excellent, expecially l'Express around the corner. My husband and I highly recommend this hotel and we look forward to returning. The only caution is one must be able to navigate the steep stairs.

<Content>Canalside taste and quality This hotel is a high quality experience and offers something different to a larger, more corporate style of hotel. It is sited on what is usually described, with justification, as the prettiest canal in Amsterdam. The tour boats actually stop at the end of it to give passengers the chance to take photos. It is close to everywhere you are likely to want to visit, and yet we found it to be very quiet. The only use we made of public transport in a 5 day stay was the tram to and from the station at the beginning and end.It is a canalside house. We had a beautiful canal view room on the 2nd floor. It is bright, having 3 largish windows,and has lots of mirrors. The room is as tastefully furnished as any I have ever had. We had a nice Sheraton style table and 2 genuine Louis XV fauteuils - armchairs. The receipt of purchase from the dealers at 4000 euros was in a drawer. There is also lovely art work in the rooms and other areas. As mentioned elsewhere a good continental style breakfast is brought to your room at a time you choose - they ring you 10 minutes before to check that you are ready.The bed was very comfortable - in fact on our first night we overslept, having slept through for 9 hours (something we have not done for years!).I think this place would suit people who put tasteful ambience above someof the things you take for granted in larger hotels. There is no bar or even useable lounge. no sauna etc. Nevertheless there is all that you will need, and everything is cared for and clean.We never saw (or even really heard) other guests. The narrow steep stairs would make it difficult for elderly or infirm visitors, and I would be worried about having children in the upper rooms, as great care is needed near to the windows - the sills are at about knee height.Our room was superb. We also peeked in other rooms and the style and quality was obvious in all of them. Of course being a house there will be rooms , eg at lower ground level that could not offer the superb outlook that we had.We have visited Amsterdam before and this will now be our preferred option when next we want to go there.We had great meals very close by - including Indonesian at Tempo Doeloe, and a very good French style bistro on Prinsengracht - Le Zinc et les Autres (or Zinc et Les Dames). Also very close are Rembrandtsplein and the Muziektheater, and the famous bridges of Magere Brug and Blauwe Brug.In short a wonderful stay in a lovely house with hosts whose anxiety to please was evident.

<Content>Loved It! We stayed in room 7 for two nights but wished we were staying longer! The room was beautiful and spotlessly clean, a sumptuous breakfast was brought to us both mornings which we ate overlooking the canal. We will definitely make a return visit!

<Content>brilliant place to stay Brilliant place to stay. When arriving you feel like at home. Very much focussed on quality and personal touch. Professional balance between quality and price. Stayed in room 6 which is by night and morning fantastic. Quality of bed and breakfast more than good. For business reasons I need to travel a lot. Many of the places I do stay can learn something here which is attention.This stay was a personal one. Again I already had a great evening with relatives but the experience of staying overnight by both gentlemen responsable for 篓running篓 this hotel was perfect. I soon return with my partner.Frans Zwetsloot, France, born in NL.

<Content>A Step Back in Time... A Romantic Adventure.... We have just returned back to Canada and I wanted to get this review written...Seven Bridges is for those who want to experience Amsterdam in an authentic artistic way. There is a lily above the sign outside and there was a scent of lillies as we walked into the hallway. Oscar Wilde and the art deco movement immediately came to my mind...Seven Bridges is a canal house similar to the type Rembrant lived in - a definite visit if you have the time. This is a great opportunity to experience something very unique. The furnishings have been selected with love and care. It is very clean and comfortable. The beautiful breakfast is supplied on exquisite china with plenty extra if you want to pack a little for later (these are heavy trays, but nothing is compromised for the sake of beauty) The hotel is tasteful, conveniently located to the Rembrant Square, where there are buses and cafes, clean and very elegant. We would definitely recommend it. We took the Garden Room number 4 as we had fairly heavy cases and it wasn't far to go up the stairs. A small passage is part of the room and makes it very convenient to put the luggage there with a glass door that closes into the suite.Our hosts were very kind and caring... we were very grateful to see some other rooms. Each contains a uniqueness and elegance of its own. I would suggest if you are chosing a room going up the stairs to bring light compact luggage as the stairs are winding and narrow. This is a characteristic of all canal houses, but good to keep in mind. We would love to come back, and wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Seven Bridges... I would definitely spend more time getting to know local people. Everyone we met were so friendly and kind. I felt a bit strange as we didn't speak any Dutch, but English is used everywhere and nobody makes you feel bad for not speaking their language.It was a truly unique and authentic experience.

<Content>So peaceful We stayed in Room 7 in September and had a wonderful stay. We especially enjoyed watching the goings-on outside by the canal while having the amazing breakfast and delicious coffee in the morning; or relaxing in the chairs, with the sun pouring in the open windows in the late afternoon, after a day spent walking all over Amsterdam. It was peaceful, lovely, and we will not stay anywhere else when we go back to Amsterdam. Gunter, Erik, and Pierre were great; they had very helpful suggestions about everything we asked about, including what platform to catch our train to Bruges on when we finished our stay with them. We can鈥檛 say enough good things about our experience. It was the best place we stayed during our 24 day, 4 country trip to Europe. Pack lightly would be my advice if you鈥檙e worried about the stairs.

<Content>Great find! Great location. Within walking distance of all sights/places of interest. Quirky and interesting decor (antiques, original paintings, etc.) and every room is decorated differently. You can choose the room of your choice online if you book well enough in advance - unfortunately we didn't and ended up with an attic room. Lovely room, but a long way up with bags, etc (no lift!) Friendly service. Great breakfast delivered to room every morning that kept us going all day. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would have no problem returning here. Overall, good value for money.

<Content>Home from Home Many thanks to Gunter, whose hotel provided an appreciative couple with the perfect venue in which to relax for a long (but still too short) weekend. We stayed in Room C, on the first floor of the town house next door but one to the hotel. It felt like our own private hideaway, with a handsome lounge area separated from the comfortable bedroom by a wood and glass panelled partition. The beautiful furniture and lighting really made a difference to the atmosphere, and you get a sense that real thought and passion has gone in to this hotel; it's a world away from the bland anonymity of most hotel accommodation.The room was excellent, and really made our weekend; we looked forward to heading back there after a long day walking the streets of the city, knowing that we had a great place to relax in before heading out for a meal in one of the good restaurants along Utrechtsestraat. Highly recommended, especially if you want privacy and the space to unwind with a glass of wine after a day exploring Amsterdam.

<Content>Fabulous - We loved it. 27th January 2008We booked the Seven Bridges Hotel as we wanted something special for our 30th Wedding Anniversary. We were certainly not disappointed. The welcome was warm and friendly and our room gorgeous. We stayed in Canal Room C, which surpassed all our expectations, the furnishings were lovely , the lighting warm and cosy and the canal view stunning. The hotel is ideally situated for all the sights, yet in a quiet beautiful street. Thanks also to Gunter for making our weekend so special and memorable. I would highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to stay again.

<Content>You don't know what you are missing... I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world - to me they are all the same. The Seven Bridges however is a totally different experience for me - it is like home! I am very impressed by the beauty of the decor and furnishings. Museum pieces! You can tell that Gunther and Pierre take pride in everything they do. I find it a refreshing start to the day as we are presented each morning with different floral designs of Villeroy  Bosch bone china sets that come with a generous continental breakfast - a complete meal by itself! Service is friendly and professional. I would describe this as a hotel with a personal touch, yet there is a lot of space for you to do your own thing.I will no doubt be telling all my friends in Singapore of my memorable experience here! And I will definitely be returning to stay again!

<Content>Disappointed I picked this hotel having read the rave reviews on Tripadvisor.I think I must have been just very unluckly with the particular room I was assigned - a room at basement level. Maybe the other rooms are much nicer but my experience was quite disappointing. The basement room is reached via a narrow and fairly shabby staircase, with a smell of damp. the bedroom itself was warm and reasonably spacious but not very comfortable, and with an eclectic mix of old (as opposed to antique) furniture. The bathroom was really very small (although to be fair I had been told this in advance) with paint peeling. The shower area was so off-putting that I couldn't bring myself to even use it!

<Content>Lovely This is a really lovely hotel, beautiful rooms, in a charming street, helpful and friendly staff, great breakfast and at a very reasonable price.It is cosy (although the rooms are not small) and homely, and so is not for you if you want somewhere flashy, and breakfast is served in the bedroom as there are no public rooms, but for me this made it an even more relaxing and comfortable experience.I would recommend to friends or family who are travelling to Amsterdam.

<Content>The perfect hotel This hotel is just perfect. My husband and I spent six nights in Room B of the Seven Bridges and had a wonderful time. Aesthetically, the hotel is amazing, with Turkish rugs in the entry way, colorful tiling in the bathroom, and leather chairs and adorned mirrors in the main bedroom. Our room was spacious, extremely well-maintained, and spotless, and had everything we needed, including a kitchenette. I was under the weather for a portion of the trip and this was a great home away from home. The hotel is also centrally located and the staff are incredibly kind and helpful. I highly recommend the Seven Bridges!

<Content>Great B Excellent hotel. If I had to complain about something, it would be delayed hot water in the small bathroom and hearing people (barely) above our room. But really, there is nothing to complain about. This place was wonderful and perfect for our needs. We stayed in the bottom room (least expensive), which borders the garden. The room was cozy and comfortable. The staff is very nice and the breakfast could count for 2 meals. The location is unbeatable. All the canals running around downtown, just near the hotel, are very quiet but the nearby Rembrantplien makes this a good choice no matter what.This would be my first choice for a return visit.

<Content>Home away from home We just returned from a weekend getaway at the Seven Bridges room #6 with a canal view. It was fantastic! The hotel and the room itself were charming. Each day we'd wander through Amsterdam's streets and return to our cozy little place filled with lovely furnishings, an extremely comfortable bed, and an exquisite view of the canal. Breakfast was a treat, sipping coffee out of fine china looking out at the canal ... a sublime way to start the day. The location is great - everything was in walking distance, there was a spectacular coffee shop and bar right next door - who could ask for more! If and when I return to Amsterdam i will definitely plan to stay there again.

<Content>wonderful and charming hotel We stayed 3 nights in the Seven Bridges hotel, in November 2007.We had the room 7. It is one of the room looking at the canal. The room has 3 windows, that enable to enjoy daylight and the wonderful and quiet view. The room has luxuous classical furniture giving a cosy and comfortable atmosphere.The owners of the hotel are very pleasant. Despite our late arrival, they were waiting for us. As the hotel has no dining room, the full continental breakfasts are served inside the room.This hotel was part of a great WE in Amsterdam.

<Content>Home in Amsterdam Put quite simply, we will not visit Amsterdam unless we can stay at the Seven Bridges! Having visited the city 9 times, we know it very well and having been unfortunate not to discover the Seven Bridges until our 3rd visit, could not believe how beautifully furnished and situated the hotel is compared to previous experiences. We have always stayed in Room A, a basement apartment which we have totally fallen in love with! The apartment is small and cosy but plenty large enough to provide a home from home and a great place to relax after many hours walking the streets of Amsterdam!Situated on a beautiful and very quite canal (no trams to wake you up at the crack of dawn!) and yet a stones throw from great shopping, restaurants and attractions, the apartment is surprisingly light and airy. It is beautifully furnished with fantastic original Dutch furniture, a really comfortable bed (with lovely soft, clean bedding) and a small but modern and spotless bathroom, also beautifully decorated. The apartment provides all the mod cons you could need and is always spotlessly clean. The hand made wooden mirrors make it feel even more spacious and are a great feature.The welcome is always very warm and best of all, the independence offered by an apartment with its own entrance makes us feel as though we live in the city and blend in with the real Amsterdammers rather than feeling like tourists!We can't recommend it highly enough - we're going back for a week over Christmas and would not do so unless we could spend this special time somewhere equally special!

<Content>beautiful boutique hotel we have justed stayed for 9 nights at the Seven Bridges and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Amsterdam. It is in a great location on a very pretty canal. The room was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. The breakfasts are a real highlight. The staff were very helpful and friendly. This hotel is also non smoking, a very rare thing in Amsterdam and a further attraction.Would definitely recommend this hotel .

<Content>Charming My friend and I just finished our stay at the Seven Bridges Hotel, and we found it absolutely wonderful. We stayed in Room 5, which was very, very, very, nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It was great to have breakfast brought to our room every day...and it was a lot of food. We were usually not hungry for lunch. It was such a charming, homey and wonderful place to stay. The room was beautifully furnished, and spacious. It was nice to stay in a more home like setting instead of a more 'traditional' hotel room. The location of the hotel is great. It was within walking distance to most everything you would want to see. Very close to restaurants and shops. On my next trip to Amsterdam, I will definitely be staying here. And I highly recommend it to anyone travelling there!

<Content>Private and Charming We stayed here for the Amsterdam Marathon. We liked the place. It was easy to find and in a pretty part of Amsterdam. The rooms were a good size. The hotel was very private, it had a nice atmosphere and the decor was charming. Having breakfast delivered to the room added to the sense of being away from it all and not being in a corporate type hotel. The staff were very accommodating and friendly. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for couples taking a break in Amsterdam.

<Content>Great stay, great hosts For my first visit to Amsterdam, I read the overwhelmingly positive reviews and chose the Seven Bridges. I'm very happy I did.The hotel is in a postcard-perfect location in the Canal Belt, but it's not too sleepy: a short walk brings you to shopping on Utrechtsestraat (including two very good CD stores, Concerto and Get) and nightlife on Rembrandtplein.I stayed in room A for five nights. This room is in the basement, and the proprietors do not serve breakfast in it. However, the room has several advantages. For one, it is an excellent bargain. For another, it is cheerful and quite spacious, with ample sunlight, windows facing the canal, and its own entrance onto the street. The room features a kitchenette with a small refrigerator with utensils and coffee and tea. You can pick up your own breakfast at the standout bakery on Utrechtsestraat to eat in your room. If you have any doubts about whether this room is appropriate for you, you can see several photos of it on the hotel's Web site.The proprietors were friendly and graciously accommodated a special request. They also allowed me a peak into one of the more opulent upstairs rooms, and it was amazing. I'd definitely return, either to room A or (for a splurge) one of the upstairs ones!

<Content>A warm, friendly and charming experience My wife and I stayed in Canal Room 7 for a full week. This is definitely an excellent Bed and Breakfast experience. The hotel is in a superb location allowing you to walk to most major attractions. It is also a block from a major tram stop. So getting around is really easy. The breakfast was excellent and included a very ample serving of cheese, ham, juice, buns of every variety and coffee or tea. Gunter is an excellent host and did everything to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.One word of caution. When you book, be sure you know where your room is located. As with most canal houses the stairway is really difficult. It is a spiral-like stair case and can be very tough with large or heavy luggage. Overall, if you like warmth and atmosphere, this is a great place to stay.

<Content>A wonderful place to stay! My husband and I just returned from a 6- night stay at the Seven Bridges.It was our first visit to Amsterdam, and we decided on the Seven Bridges based on all the Trip Advisor reviews. All I can say is 鈥?the reviews could not have been more correct. We decided to stay in Room 6 based on the pictures posted on their web site.For two people, we had plenty of room, and a nice size bathroom with shower. We also wanted a canal view, and this room overlooked one of the prettiest (so we were told on our canal boat tour) in all of Amsterdam. I strongly suggest checking out the web site, as it gives very good detailed information, and I like that you can actually see pictures of the rooms. Keep in mind (as the web site states), the photos are taken with a wide-angle lens, but they are still a very good size. We actually got to see Room 5, and even though it did not have a canal view, it was a little larger and had a little patio where you could sit out (weather permitting) and have breakfast. It was lovely, and next time, we may have to try Room 5.  If you are looking to stay in a beautiful, spotless clean, friendly-staffed canal house, then this is the place for you. Our room rate included breakfast, which was served in our room each morning. Fresh squeezed orange juice, coffee, yogurt, fruit, croissants and delicious breads and jam made for a great start to the day, and there was plenty to carry you over to lunch if need be. Each morning we would open up the curtains, sit by the windows and watch the morning unfold Amsterdam style.Gunter, Pierre and Erik were very discreet, and the perfect hosts.If you needed something or had a question, they were there. Otherwise, you were left alone to enjoy and come and go as you please.As for location, you could not ask for better. We used the tram only a few times, as walking is so easy and so much more fun. Pack a pair of good walking shoes, get lost on purpose, and just explore. I鈥檇 like to thank Gunter, Pierre and Erik for a memorable stay.And 鈥?I special thank you to our friends (you know who you are), for our wonderful dinners, day trips and 13-mile bike ride!

<Content>Splendid Hotel in Great Location We stayed at Seven Bridges on short trip to Amsterdam and absolutely loved the experience. The first night we were in Garden Room 5, which was large, convenient and absolutely spectacular. For the second night we moved to the much smaller but still adequate Garden Room 3. We would have preferred to have stayed both nights in #5 (even at the higher rate), but I made the reservation close to our arrival date and it was only available for the first night.While the rooms are nice, it's really the service and location that set this hotel apart from the rest. The breakfast brought to our room each morning was splendid. I still dream about the warm, freshly baked croissants. The management was very friendly, offering expert advice on what to see, where to eat, etc. We walked everywhere, enjoying the exercise, fresh air and sights. It was a great visit and I highly recommend the Seven Bridges to anyone looking for a comfortable, non-chain hotel in Amsterdam.

<Content>Excellent hotel We are a young couple from Brasil, stayed for 6 days in september, 2.007. We stayed at room B. The room has a very good size, good shower, little kitchen inside. People in the hotel are really kind and the hotel has a good location, near from Reblanplein, and within walking distance from everything nice to know in the city. We really enjoyed staying there!!

<Content>Cute and Cozy This is FANTASTIC BB in a beautiful neighborhood in Amsterdam, away from all the craziness of Dam square. Although all the city sites are easily accessible by foot or bike. The rooms are well cleaned and cared for by an excellent staff who is not over/under bearing. They will help if you need them and we'll give you privacy the rest of the time. The breakfast was very impressive, the croissants were some of the best in the city. We would highly recommend this hotel to anybody that wants feel at home in a real Amsterdam neighborhood.

<Content>Our Fairytale Home in Amsterdam! My husband and I stayed at the Seven Bridges for a couple nights in Amsterdam a few weeks ago. I would recommend taking the tram. we decided to walk from the train station which was not a good idea. it looked a lot closer on the map.anyway, we were in room 1B. they do not serve breakfast in this room, but the first night we slept very late and the next morning we had to be up and out very early to go home, so no breakfast was really needed. the hotel is on the corner of an area where there are connecting canals and there are a number of bridges going over them. the area is really one of the nicest in Amsterdam that we saw and is completely charming. all of the houses have their own character--different heights, colors, windows. you really feel like you are in a fairytale book. we had our own door, entrance and key...so it was much like having your own apartment in Amsterdam and you could come and go as you please. the location is amazing being about halfway between the red light district and the museum district. it's also a stone's throw away from rembrantsplein where there are a lot of fun bars and restaurants to relax and watch the people go by.the room was comfortable. and for the price you really cannot beat it. the only problem we had was we had arranged for a shuttle van to come and pick us up in the morning for the airport and they didn't show. the hotel that we had to wait in front of in the square called and had one come and get us. it ended up being fine, but we were happy we left a lot of time so there wasn't any problem.

<Content>a perfect elegant retreat We stayed at the Seven Bridges for the first time in March 2007, having read all the wonderful reviews on Trip Advisor. All the good things you read are true!We had room 8 on the top floor, but also had the chance to see some of the other rooms and they all look beautiful. We were originally booked into room 4 with the garden view, but on arrival were asked if we would mind changing as the air conditioning was being installed. (note that this is complete now, for those who complained last summer!). We were happy to change as the new room was lovely, and although we were offered the opportunity to move back to our original booking during our stay, we felt so cosy in our upper room that we elected just to stay there! Our early arrival and check in due to our flight was accomodated without any problems. Similarly on departure, we requested an earlier breakfast, and again this was not a problem. As to the breakfast, well other reviewers have said all there is to say on the huge platters and the tasteful china. Suffice to say that you may not need lunch!As it was March, it was quite cold outside, and it was bliss to return to our cosy room which was always wonderfully warm. In fact, just coming back to the hotel and walking up the steep steps, it is easy to imagine that this is your home. The hosts are so charming and welcoming, it feels as though you are staying with good friends for a couple of nights, and certainly nothing like being in a hotel. The stairs inside the hotel are very steep, but this is all part of the charm, and we thought it was fun!The location has been well reviewed - we can only repeat that it is an ideal location, easy to get everywhere once you get your bearings, lots of good restaurants nearby and handy for the tram if you don't want to walk any more. The views of the canals are fabulous, and it is easy to sense the history behind the city.As we have been to Amsterdam before, we did not plan to visit any of the usual tourist venues, but the Seven Bridges is ideal for just wandering the banks of the canals and taking in the sights and lifestyle.We have nothing but praise for the hotel, the biggest problem will probably be making a repeat booking, as it is so rare to find such a charming place whose owners really care about their guests! Thank you to our gracious hosts.

<Content>Outstanding!!! My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights this summer - and then returned for one night to be in Amsterdam for our return trip home. It was a wonderful experience. We had a room that directly overlooked the canal - and was a beautiful and varied view. The room itself was a delight - warm, tastefully decorated, immaculately clean, good size, and upbeat feeling. Also, the owners and their staff were always helpful... and gave us free access to the internet via a laptap they let us use in our room. There's a very warm, welcoming feeling to this hotel... and I heartily recommend it!

<Content>Seven Bridges is absolutely charming! We loved our stay at the Seven Bridges. It is one of the best BB鈥檚 we have ever stayed in, and we have stayed in a lot of places around the world.Having been to Amsterdam a ton of times in the last 15 years, we can say without any reservations that the Seven Bridges is the best place we have stayed in Amsterdam. Some people might think that it is expensive, but it is not when you compare it to the prices of other places in Amsterdam. We have slept in some very nice hotels in Amsterdam and paid less money, but the places are unbelievably small, so small that you can hardly turn around in them. That is fine for maybe one night, but more then that it gets a little tiring. One place we stayed at we had to put our suitcase under the bed when we were not using them because there was no where else to put them. Granted all of the places we have stayed at in Amsterdam have been old canal houses that have been turned into a hotel or BB, so we cannot say if the Seven Bridges is the best place to stay in Amsterdam, but it is the best non-chain hotel in Amsterdam by far. What is the point of traveling somewhere new if your hotel looks like any other place anywhere in the world? When you are traveling the place you sleep should have character and charm, which the Seven Bridges definitely does.The Seven Bridges feels like you are staying with a local. This last time we stayed in room 7 and our friends stayed in room 6 from June 14 to 19, 5 fantastic nights. We have stayed in room 6 on a previous visit, so opted to try room 7. The rooms have stunning wooden floors, art work decorates the walls, and the furniture is all antique. In a museum you would never be allowed even touch one of the chairs. We were glad that there was no wall to wall carpeting because in hotels they always seem a bit dirty. Instead there are lovely Persian carpets on the wooden floors, which wood floors are definitely more in line with something you would find inside of a true Dutch home. There are also floor to ceiling glass windows that look out onto the lovely canal. It is just stunning. Plus the bathrooms are unbelievably large for a canal side hotel. Next time we hope to stay next door in rooms A, B or C, and skip the breakfast. As much as we love the breakfast and it is so nice being able to chat with hosts of the Seven Bridges, we cannot wait to buy some of the yummy things from the bakeries and cheese shops nearby and make our own breakfasts. For 15 years we have tried to stay at the Seven Bridges, but could never get a reservation. We are very thankful that there are rules now to the reservation system because it has given us a chance to stay at this hotel. In the past it always seemed like they were full up, and we tried many months in advance. With the new system we increased the number of nights we were staying, so that we knew we would be able to book a room ahead of other people.A little tip for anyone going to Amsterdam, we met this lovely man named Max, who does private boat tours for friends. In order to become one of his friends please email him to set up when would be a good time to go during your visit, and to find out costs. He also does 鈥渟low food鈥?boat cruises. 鈥淪low food鈥?boat tours are leisurely paced cruises with a fantastic homemade meal served. His boat is rather small, only holds at most 6 people. Max鈥檚 email is [--]

<Content>A jewel in the Amsterdam crown You will find this lovely hotel a peaceful retreat only 2 minutes walk from the busy Rembrandtplein. As previous reviews state the rooms  hosts are welcoming  the breakfast (served at 8am as requested) superb with warm croissants, cheese,fruit, yoghurt, choices of breads with jam  butter (we requested no meats which was noted) and a choice of tea or coffee. We had coffee  again to repeat previous reviews it was the best we had ever tasted - all served on a clean matching china set.It does feel like you are a welcome guest in a very nice canalside private house. We stayed in attic room 9 (150 euros per night) right at the top of some very winding steep stairs- choose a lower room if you have a heavy case! The room was better than expected as had a T.V  a newly installed fridge cleverly disguised as a marquetry bedside cabinet - sweet touch. Everything was clean  in order as shown in the pictures on their website.Mosquitoes were mentioned in another review so did take repellant although we only saw one in the room.The hotel provided a very useful map with the hotel  a few sites ringed - we walked to most areas in our three 3 night stay.We caught a taxi from the train station (11 euros) but took the tram (no 4 from Utrechtsestraat) to return @ 3.20 euros for both for the return journey. Highly recommend  would stay again on returning to Amsterdam - may be to room 5 as passed the room on the way down stairs  looked in as the door was open - as well as the opulent furniture,mirrors  rugs they had a large flat screen t.v  small courtyard garden- great stuff! Hope you enjoy your stay as we did.

<Content>Smashing little hotel We had an excellent experience at this hotel, the owners were very friendly and helpful and we had a good laugh with them. We stayed in Room number 8 and we loved the decor; it was really cosy and quiet. Massive breakfast was served in our room and we' ll definitely go back.

<Content>A very beautiful gem I decided to go to Amsterdam literally at the last minute, but still wanted to stay somewhere special. After looking online I saw this hotel and from the minute I saw the photos I knew I had to stay here and nowhere else would do.The owners truly went out of their way to help me secure the last room they had available, but oh, I could not believe how lovely the garden room was and I cannot begin to describe my joy when I was told it was reserved for me. A really big thank you to the most sweetest of hoteliers I have ever come across. Staying at this accomodation in particular was important to me, as I wanted to see specific museums and this hotel was in the middle of each one I wanted (and got) to see during my 24 hours in Amsterdam.The location was very peaceful, pretty, clean, very safe, away from all the hustle and bustle, but close enough to get to some eateries when you have no energy left to wander far.Even on the canal circular, the guides said the location of the hotel - 7 Bridges - was one of the best in Amsterdam.I would definitely stay here again and am now going to recommend this hotel to everybody I know, it is a real beautiful gem, spotlessly clean, and everywhere I looked within the en suite room, one by one everything caught my eye, from the furnishings to the look and glorious smell of fresh lilies.Compared to other hotels prices during high season and at extremely short notice for a single room, this hotel beats the lot, in every way. If you are feeling low or stressed believe me this hotel will change all that in an instant.

<Content>Quiet Charmer This hotel is on a beautiful canal in a quiet neighborhood which has excellent restaurants and shops. We stayed in the Garden Room which is small but warmly decorated and comfortable. True to it's name the view is lush and green. It has a good bed -- we slept well. The breakfast includes especially good coffee and croissants. The proprietors could not have been kinder or more helpful.

<Content>Perfect Accommodations My wife and I stayed at The Seven Bridges for 7 nights in June/July of 2007. Our stay at the Seven Bridges was excellent. The rooms had a lot of character and were decorated with amazing detail (as mentioned by many other reviews and you can see great pictures on the Seven Bridges website). We stayed in room number 10 which is at the very top of the building. The room was very warm and cozy and really gave the feeling of what it is like to live in a canal-side home with its views of the back garden and sloped roof - especially when laying in bed on a rainy morning and listening to the rain drops bounce off of the roof. Even the walk up the winding staircase to our room added to the character and charm of our stay. I agree with another reviewer who stated that walking to our room each night felt more like we were staying at a friend's home than in a hotel.Gunter and his staff were extremely friendly and helpful in every way possible. It was a delight to see them each morning when they delivered our breakfast (a breakfast which often kept us full until dinner) or down in the reception area.The location is great as it sits on a picturesque canal just a couple blocks from Rembrandtplein (square full of cafes and a tram stop). We were able to walk to most locations - Leidseplein, Dam Square, Albert Cuyp Markt, the Jordaan, the Museum District... There is no doubt in my mind that we will stay at the Seven Bridges again the next time we are in Amsterdam. Thanks Gunter!

<Content>Will never forget My wife and I lived in 7Bridges in March, 2007. We stayed here for 4 nights. It鈥檚 very nice  romantic small hotel (thanks to tripadvisor.com for making a right choice and Gunter for nice days spent in the hotel).We were first Russians visited 7Bridges. Russian tour companies do not book such small hotels so we made all reservations by our own. It was not difficult and we did not have any problems with visas. Gunter was so kind to send us an e-mail confirmation of the reservation and Holland embassy in Moscow was fully satisfied with the printed copy of the e-mail. The only problem is to book the room in 7Bridges. We were very lucky to find an unreserved room only two weeks in advance. So we advise to Russians not to be afraid to make reservations by yourself and to stay where you want rather than where your tour company imposes you to stay.We鈥檝e got room A with individual entrance from the canal. We found it very romantic to have our own key imagining that we are true Dutchmen. The minus is that this room is not served with breakfast but it has a small kitchen with tea/coffee facilities and a small refrigerator. You can visit small stores for natives near to the hotel or visit numerous AH stores.Also I would like to note that a smart coffeeshop is located 25m from the hotel. It was rather small and we didn鈥檛 have any problems with noise or didn鈥檛 see any junkies on the street. But it was very comfortable to return home after having some smoke.The hotel is situated very close to the center a few minutes walk to Rembrandt square. At the same time it is a quiet place. Thanks to 7Bridges we will never forget our first visit to Amsterdam.

<Content>Lovely small hotel in Amsterdam My husband and I totally enjoyed our stay at the Seven Bridges during the second week in June. On our previous trip to Amsterdam, we stayed in a large hotel on Dam Square, and wanted a different experience this time. Gunter and Pierre were excellent hosts; very kind and helpful. Our room (number 4) was very comfortable and quiet with a perfect view of the leafy courtyard. The breakfasts were simple and delicious (and huge!). The location was perfect for exploring Amsterdam. We will definitely stay at this lovely canal house on our next visit to Holland.

<Content>Great small hotel - a rare gem We stayed at the Seven Bridges Hotel for 5 nights in May. We loved it. My husband and I were in Room 5 which has a patio with pots of beautiful flowering plants. It was one of the most enjoyable stays I鈥檝e ever experienced in all of Europe. The hotel is on a quiet canal street where you can sit on a bench and watch the world go by. The room was very clean and beautifully decorated. Linens, including the bed covers were changed during our stay. Twice a large vase with 3 dozen tulips were placed on the mantel which made us feel really welcomed here. The bathroom was very clean and the bathmat was changed each day (I notice little things like this and appreciate them) Each morning we dined on the bountiful breakfast which consisted of hot croissants, a variety of breads, cheese, turkey slices, bananas, apples, yogurt, coffee, tea, orange juice. We had more than enough to make small sandwiches which we took with us while exploring the city. We sat and ate them in a square or park. One day we strolled into Vondel park, put down the blanket I had in my backpack and enjoyed an impromptu picnic. We rarely saw anyone around the hotel; it was very calming. Gunter, Alex and Eric really know how to treat guests. Other innkeepers could take lessons from them. We would stay here again in a minute and probably will within the year. We love the Seven Bridges Hotel. 鈾?鈾?鈾?鈾?鈾?br/>鈽?鈽?鈽?鈽?br/>We also got the IAmsterdam card which was well worth it since we visited many museums and the card included tram/bus transportation.

<Content>Seven Bridges worked out great for us! We stayed at the Seven Bridges for a week. We had one of the modest, street-level studios rather than one of the highly decorated upstairs rooms because that was what was available. This meant we had no breakfast provided by the hotel. At first, I was disappointed by the room itself and the lack of a convenient breakfast, but I soon got used to the lack of carpeting and began to realize how nice it was to have the kitchenette. We quickly found a nearby grocery and stocked up, then made our own breakfast each morning. Since we were lodging 鈥渙utside鈥?the main hotel, we never saw the management except when we arrived and when we left. Both of them seemed quite amiable and helpful, offering us a very useful town map as well as advice, etc., so I wish we had seen more of them. We never saw the maid service, either, but they came every day and did a good job of keeping things clean.The location was nearly perfect for our needs, since Seven Bridges is located midway between the train station and the museum district. We took a cab there when we arrived, which cost a lot, but by the time we left a week later, we knew which tram to use, and it was about a Euro to get back to the train station. If you wear good walking shoes, you can walk to almost every location in the City that is of tourist interest, which is what we did.I think our area was one of the most charming around. In fact, the canal boat tours all paused at the end of our street, to allow passengers to photograph our canal and its line of bridges. We felt lucky to be staying where we were. At night, when the bridge arches are lit up, it is just magical.On the same street as the Seven Bridges is a wonderful Italian restaurant. Just a minute's walk down the street takes you to the Rubensplein, a large social square lined with places to eat and drink. Multiple tram lines stop there every few minutes. Once you get familiar with the city's tram system, everything is within reach.Given that many hotels in Amsterdam are in the $250 to $350 range per night, we consider our studio at the Seven Bridges to have been acceptable. However, I would say that, if you are used to highly refined accommodations, you might want to pass on the lower-level room we had. It had a college-student air to it. The nicer rooms upstairs undoubtedly are more pleasant, although they cost significantly more.

<Content>Loved Seven Bridges!!! Stayed last May 1st for 7 nights. My room was just perfect - comfortable, clean, good size and nicely decorated with antiques furnitures. Delicious breakfast is delivered to your room every morning. Pierre, Erik, and especially Gunter, you are great hosts! Thank you for making my stay an enjoyable experience! I will definitely return to Amsterdam and to Seven Bridges!!!

<Content>Perfect My wife and I stayed here may 9-13, 2007. When I originally tried to book a room, they were sold out, but put me on a waiting list which opened up after approx 5 days. we stayed in room #4 on ground floor which consisted of a double bed, small sitting area with table and 2 chairs, spotless bathroom and lovely view into the garden/courtyard.Gunter and Erik were extremeley helpful in booking restaurant reserverations, sightseeing etc. We ate at Jamie Oliver's 15 which was fantastic. It is located a little out of the way on the river in a new area of amsterdam. Great service, super atmosphere and exceptional food!!!The location of the hotel was fairly central. We thought about getting the Iamsterdam card or a 3 day tram pass, but decided against it after the first day. We ended up walking most of the time and purchased a stripenkart to get us home when we didn't feel like walking.Breakfast was included and was amazing! served to our room at a time previously arranged with Gunter. Plentiful, fresh and very tasty.I would highly recommend this property. It is a boutique hotel and each room has character and appeal.Would stay here again without hesitation. Many thanks to Gunter and Erik for an excellent vacation.

<Content>A Touch of Class We were extremely happy with this hotel. The owners kindly let us check in very early as we had been flying all night and the room was vacant. The staff were friendly, breakfast was lovely, the rooms are delightful, the position is excellent, the price is very reasonable, what more could you want. Just be aware that the higher floors might be difficult for elderly and infirm.

<Content>Absolutely Wonderful! First, some context: my husband and I travel quite a bit both domestically and abroad, and stay in mid-range (Hilton and Marriott) to top of the line (Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons) hotels, as well as high-end country inns and BB鈥檚. Now for the review. We just loved the Seven Bridges! We loved the accommodation, the location, and the hosts. 1) Accommodation: We stayed in the Garden Suite. We have stayed in many interesting places but this was quite unique. The antiques used to decorate the room were of very high-quality and the room proportions were impressive as well. The high ceilings, fireplace, huge windows, fabulous fabrics, furnishings, and artwork were a real delight. The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept like logs. The bathroom was spotless, spacious, bright, and modern. A glass door in the bathroom opened onto a lovely terrace with potted camellias and other plants. We are both appreciative of good design and employ an interior designer for our own home, so we are fairly picky when it comes to these types of things. 2) Location: The location is, in our opinion, perfect. The upscale neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. Yet, it is one block from the tram that provides a very quick trip to the city center station, one block to lovely neighborhood stores and restaurants, and it is, of course, in the heart of canal country. 3) Hosts: The owners of the hotel are two lovely men. We had the most contact with Gunter as he usually delivered our delicious breakfast. We just adored him. He was the kindest and most gracious host. He always seemed so cheerful and ready to offer advice. One thing that really impressed us was that, during our stay, someone from my office contacted the hotel, asking me to call. It turned out to be very sad news (someone I work with had passed away). It was evening and, sensing that something was wrong, Gunter rang our room and offered to bring up tea and cookies. When he arrived, he asked if everything was OK. It was obvious that he brought the refreshments to cheer us up which was just so sweet.In summary, for many reasons, we just loved everything about this hotel. It is the perfect place to stay while in Amsterdam.

<Content>GREAT place to stay! What a lovely to place to stay. It was so easy to book by phone having looked up the details on the internet and when we arrived we were made very welcome. Our room (the garden room, no.5) was beautifully furnished and had the bonus of a patio to sit ouside (although going through the bathroom to reach it seemed a little unusual to start with). Breakfast in the room was much nicer than going into a depersonalised dining room and was excellent, with croissants, a variety of bread (tasting deliciously homemade), cheese, meat, yoghurts and fruit. It was enough to keep us going with sandwiches for lunch too! The hotel is not like a traditional hotel chain, being more like someone's home. But the service,friendliness and quality of our room and breakfast couldn't have been better.The location is great too, as it is central to any of the museums and other attractions. We made the mistake of getting a taxi from the Central Station to the hotel - very expensive (20 euros) for a short distance. It's easily walkable, which we did going back, wheeling our suitcases. The hotel is also in one of the most attractive and peaceful areas of Amsterdam, If we ever come stay in the city again, we will DEFINITELY come and stay here again.

<Content>Perfect place to stay We were on a business trip to NL and stayed in your hotel for one night. Amsterdam was crowded but the hotel was like the oasis of peace and calm. It has its soul and character and I would recommend it to everybody who likes to be treated like a very special guest and who seeks for a nice, quiet place in Amsterdam. Congratulations to the owners!Justina and Mateja

<Content>Best value in Amsterdam Just returned from my second stay at Seven Bridges. As before, it is a wonderful little property. Gunter and Pierre are so nice, and it feels like you are a guest in their beautiful home. Stayed in room number 8 for my second time, as it is one of only two rooms that have two beds. This room faces the garden and is incredibly peaceful. With an 8 hour time change from the US, an afternoon nap seems to be in order for the first few days, and this garden room is an ideal spot. Just open the windows and listen to the birds sing with the gentle breeze blowing in...heaven. This time I travelled with two friends, so the third wheel got room number 3...also very charming and facing the garden. Tiny bathroom, but who cares? For the price, you are lucky to be getting your own bathroom in this town. We left Amsterdam to travel to Belgium mid-week, and ended up staying at the much more posh and expensive Banks Mansion for our final evening, as a one night stay at Seven Bridges is almost impossible to book for a weekend. Even with all the glitz and luxury, I missed my Seven Bridges. Elevators are over-rated, and I don't feel like I'm really in Amsterdam without dragging my bags up a narrow winding staircase. It's all part of the charm. The location is perfect...central to the whole town. Only one block off Rembrandt Square on a quiet charming canal. Close enough to all the action, but far enough away to enjoy peace and quiet whenever you need it. Breakfast is fantastic...best croissants and coffee this side of Paris...maybe better. I wouldn't be completely honest if I didn't gripe about how much planning it takes to get a room here. They won't take reservations for short stays more than 60 days out, and if you wait to book within 60 days you probably won't get it in. Their cancellation policy is strict and seems to be somewhat at their discretion, but it is worth the effort and planning. I guess with so many repeat customers and only 9 rooms, they can afford to have strict rules. I will definitely return, and it is now one of my top reasons to keep going back to Amsterdam. Thanks again for a wonderful stay. See you guys next year!

<Content>LOVED the Seven Bridges Hotel We stayed at the Seven Bridges Hotel in March this year, for 2 nights. We were greeted by Gunter who showed us to the Garden Room. What a beautiful room! It was very sumptiously furnished with lovely antique furniture and a beautiful spread on the bed that I was almost afraid to sit on, and gorgeous drapes that covered windows looking out over the back garden. The bathroom was very efficiently designed and cheery.We never heard any other guests except in the morning when Gunter was delivering the trays of food. He doesn't know it but he saved my life by providing us so much wonderful food. It was too much to eat in one sitting, for us, so i made a little sandwich with the bread and cheese and later on that day while we were out touring around the tulip farm, I got very hungry and was able to nibble on the sandwich and not faint from hunger. Thank you Gunter.The hotel is immaculate and clean, and we would definitely recommend it to anyone seeking a lovely bb that is located conveniently to everything.

<Content>The Ever Best Hotel Seven Bridges is a surprise I planned for my wife and it did win me thousands of points! Right after my wedding, I came to Europe for two years training. Now having completed the course, I searched around for excitement and unique places that may bring her exhilirating experience. Hotel Seven Bridges is my big finding. I was lucky to get a canal view room (room 7) in January. Since then I waited for two long months until this big excitement came to us. My wife is a fan of western arts. I knew she would cherish everything in Seven Bridges. And yes, she actually loved it more than I had expected. From the moment we arrived, we got overwhelmed at how cozy and unique the hotel is. There was a charming fragrance from the two bunches of lily flower in the reception room. When we climbed up the 3 hundred years stairs, we saw two other rooms (room 5 and room 6) had been set ready for their guests. Both rooms are extremely nice and have its special lay-out and art collections. The lights were all on and the atmosphere was really cozy. My wife couldn't resist rushing in to take some photos. You could see how delicately the owners of the hotel are caring their properties. We were completely beyond words. When we arrived at our room, we immediately responded with a 'wow! Everything was spotlessly clean and the canal view was so romantic. We loved the furniture, especially the pair of classic chairs. The best thing about Seven Bridges is the breakfast. It was the ever best breakfast I tasted in Europe - a huge one, with various breads, juice, coffee, tea, fruits... god! The owner sent the breakfast into our room by himself. That was the most tasteful coffee I had in my trips. We blieved that the host spends lot of time in designing and organizing the breakfast. We actually couldn't finish all the foods. What a pitty! Anyhow, I found that we did not need to eat lunch for this fabulous breakfast. It was also a great experience to talk with the owner. He is a very kind and respectable man, investing all his energy and brains in providing unique experiences for the Seven Bridges guests. We were happy and honored to learn from him that we were the first Chinese guests. I have seen some other 'big name' hotels in Amsterdam. In my view, they are just common, and located in the 'noisy' and crowded city center. The best thing about Amsterdam is its canals and the houses along the waters. Those communities are not far from city center as Amsterdam is not big, but very quiet and enjoyable. It was so interesting that we just turned a corner from the main street and suddenly entered the quiet neighbourhood. Seven Bridges is just located in the center of that quiet neighbourhood, with walking distance to all the major sites and a long dinning street just behind it. This also addes a lot of points to its overall impression to us. Having said all these, I want to clarify that business travellers with a vision to see big big lobbies, large large rooms, bath tube, smiling receptionist girl, elevators... better step away from this lovely hotel. Seven Bridges and Hilton are not on the same track! If Hilton is a rich business man, Seven Bridges is a real artist! Seven Bridges only belongs to those with a vision to seek the unique experience of arts in Amsterdam! Finally, I want to say that Amsterdam is a very safe city - just be careful of your handbags. At least we did not experience anything unpleasant walking around 10 o'clock at night around the city. Red light district is probably the safest because there are so many people there!

<Content>Charmed I spent 3 nights with my wife in december and everything was very well, the hotel is near of almost everything and you have tram and buses around the corner. Besides the hotel is in a quiet street and you have a good rest after a tourist day. I prefer this kind of hotels instead the tipical chain hotel with no personality. The thing less good is the time for breakfast, too early overall for spanish people.., but like the quality is very good never mind too much.thank you for all

<Content>Amsterdam a great place We stayed at Seven Bridges B  B in Amsterdam in Sept 2006. It was as we had read on Tripadvisor. Very good breakfast and friendly hosts. Unfortunately, we booked late and got the garden room at the back in the basement. It was ok but the mosquitos which we did not expect were terrible. I got very badly bitten every night! Take Deet. The location was good, very central for all the attractions.

<Content>Absolutely 1st class Seven Bridges is an Hotel with considerable charm and a unique ambience. It is a credit to the owners who seem to have put together a style of hotel that offers an opportunity for a relaxed stay in comfort. They are extremely helpful and the breakfast delivered to your room is a nice touch.Colin Garbutt  Dianne Wilcox

<Content>Wouldn't Trade It For A Suite At The Hilton My boyfriend and I stayed at this most amazing hotel just a few short weeks ago (mid-February) for my first trip to Amsterdam. I have never received such personal and friendly service! Each morning the owner Gunter brought us breakfast to our room; the array of food on fine china was so impressive we took a picture to bring back. Fresh fruit, warm assortment of breads, spreads, coffee and tea, freshly baked Croissants..getting up each morning out of our incredibly comfortable queen size bed was an absolute dream. Both my boyfriend and I have said that our honeymoon is going to be hard to plan after our undeniably perfect stay at the Seven Bridges Hotel.

<Content>Sparkling Gem Just returned from a three night stay at the charming Seven Bridges Hotel. What a treat. Cosy beautifully furnished room, lovely breakfast featuring warm croissants etc and a terrific location. There was even a superb bar a few yards away . Our hosts at the Seven Bridges were also super. They could not do enough for us. Just one final point. We had been told on booking that our room was the only available room but not once during our three night stay did we hear or see another human being in the building except our two hosts. A dash of mystery to add to the magic of our stay. Will definitely return

<Content>Visitors from York On returning to Amsterdam after several years we were looking for a small and intimate hotel to celebrate Valentine's Day - the Seven Bridges Hotel was perfect ! This is a small hotel with a number of canalside bedrooms with stunning views - each of the bedrooms is individually designed and furnished with antique furniture. There are no public rooms - a large and filling breakfast is brought to your bedroom on Villeroy  Bosch crockery and this just adds to the charm. The hotel is well situated for all the tourist attractions and yet is in a quiet street. The hotel website gives a true impression of the property with plenty of photographs of the wonderful bedrooms. It was easy to book directly with the owners, who were very helpful. Would we return - absolutely, we can't wait !Recommended for romantic breaks, couples, and anyone who likes an individual hotel with character. Not recommended for disabled or anyone who has difficulty with steep stairs.

<Content>The Gem of the Canals We are a couple (both 29 years old), and this was our first time in Ams.The hotel location is perfect: close to everything (sights, shopping, public transport), but still peaceful. The room furniture is magnificent - choose your room on the hotel website. Everything is very clean (bathroom, etc).The breakfast is very nice, and enough for lunch also. The hotel is very romantic, but popular so book ahead.A little extra: the coffeeshop next door is very nice (small and personal), and it does not disturb the hotel at all. People who cannot climb: go for a first/ground floor room, or avoid the hotel (no elevator, but this is standard for building around there).

<Content>a perfect, yes perfect, small hotel A perfect, yes perfect hotel. O.k., can anything truly be perfect? But as close as one can get, this hotel, and it鈥檚 staff, are.We spent a wonderful and all to typical rainy winter week (January 鈥?7) in Amsterdam, and the room, room 7, was such a wonderful and welcoming place to look forward to, to sit in and watch the beautiful views, (yes, there really are seven bridges) and to relax and really feel Amsterdam. We were lucky enough to see some of the other rooms during our stay, as a matter of fact as we came and went, Gunter, who is justifiably proud of the establishment and its contents, would ask, 鈥榃ould you like to see such and such a room, it is open at the moment鈥? so we would. I can say that the website is very accurate in its representation of the rooms, both in size and decoration. All different, all lovely.Be aware that all small Amsterdam hotels have stairs, and few if any have elevators. These are old buildings, protected by law from changes such as elevators. It is truly part of the charm, and memory, of amsterdam to navigate the infamous stairs! And i mean navigate!We were treated to the wonderful breakfasts, tea in the afternoon, wonderful conversations with Gunter and staff, ideas of things to do and see, help finding restaurants, all of our needs met and more.One day, caught in a devastating downpour close to home, we rushed back to the hotel, soaking, no, dripping wet. Before i could get the key from my pocket, the door was flung open and there was Gunter, towels in hand, 鈥淐ome in come in, let鈥檚 get you dry鈥? says he! When i asked how he could have possibly been at the door with towels waiting, he said he had just happened to look out the window and saw us running in the rain, and grabbed a couple of towels.I can not guarantee this type of experience for you, but this is typical of the level of service we had from our arrival to our departure. Perfect.

<Content>Glad to have Discovered this Gem My wife and I had this Hotel recommended to us by our daughter who liked the look of it from outside and ventured in. She was staying at the Grand Hotel at the time which is a 5 star and she said that she would have preferred to be in the Seven Bridges.We were still impressed even after reading the good reviews on Trip Adviser. It was everything we wanted and more. The room we had was in the attic and you had to negotiate a lot of stairs but that was not problem to us. The room was lovely and spotlessly clean. I was disappointed that there was not a tea/coffee facility in the room. The breakfast was excellent and we couldn't manage to eat it all.The location of the hotel was fantastic with easy access to all the 'sites' and within walking distance of good shops and restaurants.We know where we will be staying on our next visit to Amsterdam.

<Content>Fantastic Quiet Getaway...Perfect Location! We spent 3 nights at the Seven Bridges Hotel (Room B) in December just before Christmas. The hotel is exactly what we expected judging from the hotel website. The furnishings in the room were lovely, we were not disturbed or bothered by any noise from the street or staff or folks in other rooms. It was quiet with a beautiful view of the canal. The drapes were beautiful and heavy and blocked out all sunlight so that sleeping was very enjoyable. We spent our days in Amsterdam sight seeing and walked for miles ;-) We enjoyed returning to the hotel in the evenings for the peace and tranquility before heading out again for dinner. Room B does not include any food service (but does have facilities if you want to make your own tea/coffee etc in the room). Because there was no food service Gunter recommended a couple of nearby bakeries which we found and totally enjoyed...it actually enhanced our overall experience in Amsterdam. The room was very well priced and was a nice size with a large dressing room and well decorated bathroom. We plan on returning to this hotel!!! Happy Travels!

<Content>Gracious living In October 2006, I took my children on a European holiday and chose the Seven Bridges Hotel, Amsterdam, for our last two nights. I am partial to antiques and wonderful soft furnishings, which is why I chose this hotel.Another attraction was the age of the place...300 years old! It more than satisfied my expectations. We were given room 5, a large, magnificently furnished room to share, with its own balcony overlooking a private garden at the rear of the hotel, away from the noise and bustle of the canals. We had our own marble ensuite and a flat screen TV, which the children loved. Each morning, the owners brought a breakfast tray to our room, full of delicious fresh food, served on fine china....what a way to be pampered! The room was tastefully decorated with fine antiques and rich fabrics, Persian carpets and interesting artworks.We were right next to the canal, so made use of the canal cruises and enjoyed ambling along the cobbled streets and looking at galleries and shops. At night, we found a few restaurants nearby and were close to major shops and bus routes on the Rembrandtplein. Amsterdam is a joy to explore and we all loved the relaxed feel of the place and the tolerance of the Dutch to different customs. The owners were most accommodating in storing our luggage and calling taxis or advising us where to go and I would definitely like to return to this hotel.We paid 550 euros for two nights, which included the breakfast and all taxes.

<Content>New Year Bliss From start to finish our experience at Seven Bridges Hotel was A1. We arrived early in the morning and was expecting to be told that our room would not be ready until later that afternoon to our suprise we was informed by Pierre that although it was only 9:30 in the morning, that our room would be ready by 10:00 where upon we procceded to the local cafe for some refreshments. Once we returned Pierre took us to our room (Room C) which was more like a mini appartment, showed us around and gave us the keys.The room was equiped with cutlery, a fridge, tea and coffee facilities and a massive 32inch Tv. To be honest we spent most of the day in our room relaxing and enjoying the beautiful view of the cannel, and when we did venture out we came back to a lovely clean room, fresh towels and even our washing up had been done.We throughly enjoyed our time in Amsterdam and at the Seven Bridges Hotel, and cant wait to return.

<Content>Return Visit - Just as Good as Before! My husband and I returned to the Seven Bridges for a 3 night stay from 12/13/06 - 12/16/06. Our prior stay was 24 years ago!!, but the only reason we had not returned before was that the only other time we came to Amsterdam we could not get a booking. I love the fact you can select the room from the pictures - and since we were familiar with the hotel (last time staying on the top floor), we cleverly booked the room on the main floor (as we had several suitcases for a 1 month trip). The management was extrememly attentative and helpful and it made our return trip just as wonderful as the first! The guest that did not like the stay probably wouldn't have been happy anywhere!

<Content>Great Hotel in a lovely location My boyfriend and I stayed here between Christmas and New Year as a surprise birthday present for him and we loved it! The hotel is small and beautifully decorated in the unique style that the owners have put so much care and attention into. The breakfast is a real treat and is delivered to the room at whichever time you request. We stayed in room 6 which has excellent views of the canal, so our first evening was spent chilling out with the bottle of wine which was awaiting us in our room on arrival and watching the world go by along the canal.The location is perfect as you can walk to all parts of the city from the hotel. Didn't see much of the staff but they were friendly and helpful when we did! Would recommend this place to anyone, especially as a romantic treat!

<Content>The Quintessential Amsterdam Experience Seven Brideges Hotel is an ideal place to stay in Amsterdam. It's centrally located 300 years old canal house in a beautiful residential neighborhood with spectacular views of the canals and of some of the many bridges if you stay in one of the front rooms (we stayed in room 7). It's place like no other if you are there with someone special or just to rekindle your love! Waking up in the morning and looking into the canals with the sun arising in the horizon and savoring this delicious breakfast (which is delivered to your room! Wow!) made of many fresh breads and croissants, yogurt and seasonal fruits and freshly brewed coffee served on fine china and sitting on those chairs from Louis XV era around an Art Deco table from Cafe Slavia in Prague, it sure feels like you are staying in a museum or in the house of a wealthy uncle or friend (and definitely Gunter and Pierre go out of their way to make you feel like their friends!). This is a beautiful city with liberal attitude and full of civilized people and there is no other hotel with more charm and sophistication than Seven Bridges!I will go back and stay there in an instance! Many thanks to the owners and management who take much pride in their little gem!

<Content>I am very cynical Yes, I was very skeptical after having read what seemed to be too many positive reviews of a little three star hotel in Amsterdam. I mean really, I thought, how great can this place REALLY be? Just so you know my experience and so this review can be placed in context, I have stayed in three star hotels all over europe, so I know exactly how three star quality and service can vary greatly. I will say that my experience at this hotel was excellent. A friend and I stayed in Room 8 December 13th through the 17th. The day I arrived there was some trouble connecting my computer to the wireless internet, so Erik ran up the stairs to correct the problem. After he left, it occurred again, so once again he cheerfully ran up the stairs and corrected the problem again. He then went downstairs, and 5 minutes later called up and asked if I would like some tea. He again cheerfully brought up an entire tea tray for me as I awaited the arrival of my colleague. (yes, the wireless internet ended up working for me quite satisfactorily) This is the way that guests are treated here. I found Gunter and Pierre to be similarly helpful with questions, and very kind and friendly in general. All in all these gentlemen are extremely professional in the way they run this hotel, and they clearly take a lot of personal pride in how they run the hotel. This is without a doubt one of the more pleasant experiences I have had in a three star hotel.

<Content>What a charming hotel My daughter and I arrived on Sunday 17th December 2006 for a 3 night stay in the Seven Bridges Hotel. We loved it even before the door opened. Pierre took our details gave us the key and he told us we were in room 8. Up some steep stairs, but the nice thing was the doors to the rooms that were not occupied were left open so you couldn't help but see how lovely the rooms were. When we arrived into our room it was just as lovely. The bathroom was very tastefully tiled. We unpacked and went out to look at the shops. The breakfast in the morning was brought to the room and was very fresh and filling. We would certainly use the Seven Bridges Hotel again and have no compunction recommending it to anyone. My only slight criticism would be that the mattresses were too soft and the beds too low but hey we are young and coped with it. Thanks to all at the Seven Bridges Hotel and Merry Christmas

<Content>Justifiably sought-after accommodation I booked a stay as a result of reading the positive reviews on this site, and don't regret it. The key points have been mentioned elsewhere but in summary they are: 1) it's a beautiful old townhouse overlooking one of the most attractive, but quietest, hotels, just a short walk to the Rembrantplein and two tram stops; 2) the decor is tasteful and the rooms contain attractive antiques;3) the owners take an obvious pride in what they do.In answer to the couple of negative reviews I think people should be realistic in their expectations - given the age of the property it's unsurprising there are steep steps, there's no dining room and they don't welcome big groups or unruly kids. If you want to stay somewhere faceless and efficient go to the Ibis or similar.

<Content>We loved it We just spent a week at Seven Bridges (Nov 28 - Dec 4). We were in Room A, the smallest and least expensive room in the hotel. It is in the basement of the second canal house, and, at 110 E. per night (breakfast not included), is very economical by Amsterdam standards.We have been to Amsterdam 5 or 6 times and have stayed at a different hotel each time, All of them came well recommended on this website (each with a bad review or two amidst a ton of good reviews) and all have been nice -- imperfect in some way, but all very good in some way. Seven Bridges is one of the better places we have stayed, and we can recommend it without hesitation. If you want a traditional hotel room at a major inner city hotel with a fancy lobby, this is not the place for you. What Seven Bridges was for us was a quaint, local guesthouse, a very nicely appointed room in a very convenient and central location, very convenient to public transportation, yet on a relatively quiet street in a great neighborhood. It would have been nice to have a larger and more expensive room that was eligible for breakfast (particularly after reading the reviews of the breakfast) -- we would have gladly taken it had it been available -- but Room A was the only room available, and it was charming and perfectly acceptable, and made up for the lack of breakfast with a kitchenette. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was small but perfectly adequate, it was very clean and well appointed. The kitchenette had a fridge and a stove that came in very handy (we were able to eat a meal or two in, and reheat some great Indonesian food from Indrapura and Tempo Doloe, two excellent restaurants nearby). The pictures of Room A on the hotel's website are completely accurate.Apart from the room, the owners and the staff were helpful and courteous to a fault, and the only other room in the hotel which we were able to see (the owner showed it to us briefly on the morning we checked out) was much more substantial and charming as well. Perfect?? No, not perfect. Did we love it?? Yes. Is this a place we would consider returning to in the future? Yes, without a doubt. Our compliments to the owners for creating and maintaining such a wonderful B  B.

<Content>A gem full of ambiance We spent a delightful seven days at the Hotel Seven Bridges and will again at our next opportunity to visit Amsterdam.If you're looking for a large five-star hotel that caters to your every need, has expensive restaurants and a fancy spa, stay at the Amstel. But, if you want to stay at an authentic canal house with all the touches of home and truly delightful staff, then go to the Seven Bridges. Notwithstanding the hike up the stairs, our room at the top was most comfortable and steeped in ambiance. The furnishings, selected by their proud hotel owner, were authentically European. The location was ideal for walking the old city and if we needed a taxi for dinners out of the area, the staff made sure our reservations were in order and car arrived on time.We can't wait to go back.

<Content>A realistic review We Stayed in room b in the summer of 2006, 2 adults. Choosing this hotel after reading alot of good reviews on this site.First of all all the good things... the location is good. Except the location, theres really nothing good to say about our stay in room b.Theres NO AIRCONTION, the room is VERY SMALL, and the view was straight out to the street, walking people can look directly in the room, if curtains arent closed. That leaves you with NO VIEW.Theres NO BREAKFAST served in this room, thats due to an tiny tiny kitchen in this room i guess. Allthough there no proper diningtable avalible. And not atleast the BEDSHEETS WAS NOT CHANGED AT ALL, thats in a period of 6 nights, in the summer. The bedcarpet is a heavy thing, and wonder if this is ever washed.For a price of 135euros/night ($180/night) this hotelroom is to be reviewed as below average.This is a no go.And it has to be sayed, this is a honest review, no personal critisism of the owners of the hotel.

<Content>A Gem of an Hotel Just returned with my partner from a brief 2 night stay (13th-15th November 2006) at the Seven Bridges Hotel. What a gem to find in the heart of Amsterdam within easy walking distance of shops, restaurants and museums. We stayed in Room A which is the basement of the annex property 2 doors down. A front door opens into a small lobby and a second door enters into the room. I say room but it's more like a self contained studio flat with bedroom, adjoining kitchenette (sink, 2 ring gas hob, pots  pans, kettle, cutlery  crockery for 2), en-suite bathroom (sink, toilet and a huge walk-in shower - exellent for sharing!!!). Tea, coffee, sugar and powered milk are provided as this room does not come with served breakfast.The double bed was extremely comfortable and modern along with the other furnishings. There's a circular marble table with wicker chairs and cushions in the kitchenette and a glass coffee table with 2 cane chairs  cushions to the right of the bed. There's a TV to the right of the front door which has a number of channels including BBC. On the marble floor there are 2 colourful rugs.The photos of the room on the hotel website are just as you will find the place. Indeed, whilst we were checking out, Gunter was kind enough to show us Room 5 which is the Jewel in the Crown of this splendid place. The room is even bigger and more elegant than it looks on the website photos!The whole place was spotlessly clean and fresh towels were brought each day.At night, a doorlight comes on as you descend the few steps to the front door making it easy to see the keyhole. It felt just like it was our pied a terre. I thoroughly recommend staying at the Seven Bridges and we can't wait to go back.Our next trip hopefully will be for my birthday at the end of February 2007.

<Content>Seven Bridges of Happiness My wife and I arrived on a rainy night from Athens. Wet and tired we were greeted at the door by Gunter and Pierre. Right from the start we knew this was the best place to stay.They helped lug our suitcases up a winding stairwell to the third floor, into a marvelous room overlooking the canal below. What a relief after spending the day in taxis, a subway, a train, and an airplane.The room was charming and had a neat European atmosphere. Not overly decorated, yet visually pleasant. Our room was clean and tidy, with spotless windows. The furniture was stylish and the hotel provided a short history on some of the furnishings.The bathroom was larger than expected with a shower that had steamy hot water and room for two. We slept like logs on a very comfortable, large-sized bed. The radio on the nightstand was a delight.Breakfast was served in our room. A multitude of warm breads, cheeses, yogurt, fruit, and a pot of coffee made our stay the Seven Bridges Hotel complete.When we return to Amsterdam, we will request our room at the Seven Bridges Hotel. A fun and fabulous place to stay.Warmest regards,Chris Krajniak  Anne Kuhry

<Content>Elegant Amsterdam We have stayed in Amsterdan many times ( at least 10!) and this hotel was one of the best we have stayed in.Our bedroom was furnished with some lovely antiques ; a huge inlaid wardrobe and heavily laquered table. They added an elegant, romantic dimension to our trip. Our room was described as the Garden Room, accurately as we had access to our very own roof garden. Gunter and colleague were good hosts and brought a delicious breakfast to our room every morning.. I would check out the photos on thier website. I think they give a good flavour of what to expect.

<Content>Private and charming, with great service We fell in love with Amsterdam during our vacation and that had quite a lot to do with our stay at the Seven Bridges Hotel.The location is wonderful; we could walk to many places, including the Albert Cuyp market, galleries and museums. There were several excellent restaurants very nearby that were recommended by the hotel owners.The room we stayed in was furnished with beautiful period antiques, and had a charming terrace that overlooked the small gardens of the neighboring houses. The bed was very comfortable. Every morning a tray would be delivered to our room, laden with tender, buttery croissants; several types of fresh and excellent-quality breads; good cheese and sliced meat; delicious yogurt; fine quality jams and real butter; fresh fruit; and truly exceptional coffee. We would linger over breakfast while deciding how we would while away the day in this beautiful city.The hotel owners were promptly responsive when we needed an adapter for our laptop, and they happily provided a corkscrew every night for our wine. We found them to be friendly and courteous, yet respectful of our privacy.Overall, I cannot think of a single negative point regarding our stay at this hotel. We loved Amsterdam and if we return, Seven Bridges Hotel is definitely where we would stay.

<Content>The best hotel in Amsterdam . . . I've been to this fabulous city several times, but have never been able to get a room at this hotel. Happily, my husband and I were fortunate enough to stay at the Seven Bridges Hotel for 5 nights at the beginning of this November. Our room, with a wonderful view of the canal, was charmingly furnished, very comfortable and spotlessly clean. We felt so at home, it was very difficult to leave. Breakfast brought to our room was the ultimate luxury; the fresh breads, croissants, cheeses, and coffee were the perfect start to every day. The location was great: off the beaten path, but within 5 - 10 minutes of multiple restaurants, shopping, museums, etc. Pierre and Gunter are perfect professionals. They were friendly and informative, but never intrusive. What more can I say about an establishment that loaned us an umbrella, an extension cord, and a flower vase? We would go back next week if we could, and certainly plan to stay there again sometime in the future.

<Content>Stay away ! Tried to book 4 double rooms, but he manager didn鈥檛 want us at he the hotel. This is what he said: 鈥淭he problem with a group of people is that there is a chance that they might disturb the other guests, simply by talking with each other in the hallway, visiting each other in the rooms, etc.鈥?br/>We are all 33 years old, and not a bunch of teenagers. We really wanted to stay at this hotel, so it was very sad that they didn鈥檛 want us there.

<Content>Feels Like You Live in Amsterdam Perfect retreat in a quiet but central area of the city, Seven Bridges makes you feel like you're at home. Breakfast is served in your room where there is table space in front of a beautiful picture window. Room 8 overlooked gardens, but all the rooms had beautiful views. Beds were very comfortable. Evenings were quiet for sleeping. Canal location is gorgeous. The best thing were the hosts as they were as accomodating as possibe - gave guidance on restaurants, provided laptop for use for free internet, provided a great fan when needed(perfect for noise masker and cooling as we like the room cold). You get your own key to the front door so you can come and go as you please. Drawbacks are the very steep stairs (almost ladder like) and the lack of air conditioning (though most places in Amsterdam do not have AC). But overall, the room quality, cleanliness, breakfast and hospitality make this a true bargain.

<Content>Beautiful direct canal views! Very spacious room and wonderful direct view of the Seven Bridges canal. Nice location although quite a few blocks to the downtown shopping and major restaurants. Nevertheless, in nice weather it is a very nice and scenic walk through the canals and gorgeous buildings with unusual architecture. Word of caution: there are no elevators in the hotel and it is a very, very steep and narrow climb up and down the stairs if you have to carry your luggage! We were fortunate that the owner was very charming and assisted us with our luggage but if he had not been there it would not have been easy. Overall, a very nice experience primarily due to the owner going out of his way for us and the beautiful direct canal views from our room.

<Content>fine small hotel My family of 4 (2 children aged 10 and 15) stayed at the 7 Bridges for 4 days in July. The hotel is the quintessential Amsterdam canal house- charming, authentic, perfectly located- walking distance to every major attraction. The room was clean, comfortable, spacious- no air conditioning, lovely outdoor terrace. It was the only room that could accommodate 4 people. Excellent breakfast served in our room daily. Helpful staff- stored our luggage until room was ready. This is not a modern American style hotel. but for those seeking to experience the true Amsterdam, this was a wonderful place to stay. My children thoroughly enjoyed it, and we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful Experience - Highly recommended We just returned from a weekend break in Amsterdam and we couldn't be happier with our experience at the Seven Bridges. The hotel is charming with a capital C. The owners' care and pride is evident everywhere, and we enjoyed staying in a centuries-old canal house, with its typical steep staircase.We were in room 10, which is a smaller attic room under picturesque steep eaves. The double bed was incredibly comfortable and we slept well. Coming from the noise and bustle of London, we found Amsterdam in general and the Seven Bridges in particular very quiet and restful. The hotel is in a very lovely part of the city, on one of the prettiest canals in central Amsterdam. We walked everywhere and found the hotel convenient for all the must see sights. When it was time to go to the airport, the owner called us a cab which came right away.Breakfast was brought to our room promptly both mornings, with a courtesy phone call five minutes before to let us know it was on the way. We couldn't finish all the plentiful, lovely food - several types of bread, yogurt, meat, cheese, orange juice and delicious coffee. What a terrific way to start the day!We would definitely return to the hotel - it's a unique, special experience.

<Content>Be prepared! We stayed in this hotel in September after reading the rave reviews on this web site. We were in canal room C which was a great room with a sitting area and a huge window overlooking the canal. The room was great really, you felt like you actually lived there. However it had a few major problems...although the window was huge it barely opened and we were warned not to open it at all due to the mosquitos(more like vampires) and when we were there it was hot so the room was somewhat uncomfortable. Another thing was if you are sensitive to smoke(specifically the kind at the coffeehouses) try another room. The odor drifted into the room from the coffeeshop downstairs. Besides that the location was good and although we never saw the owners they were friendly enough when we checked in. We had our own key to the front door so like I said you really felt as if it were your own home.

<Content>Another great stay at Seven Bridges I just enjoyed a three night stay at Seven Bridges. I must agree with all of the positive comments made by other recent guests. A lovely little hotel, elegant yet unpretentious, within walking distance of all major attractions and shopping therapy. Amsterdam has to be one of the greatest walking cities in Europe, and this is an ideal base for the active traveler. I would recommend adding some kind of informational folder in the rooms, with the history building, hotel services and descriptions of local services and amenties, standard fare for an accomodation of this class. I like Room 9 at the very top and Room 5 if you are into antiques and mirrors.

<Content>A perfect retreat! We have just returned from a 3 night break at Seven Bridges. Perfect location, very picturesque, quiet, yet in easy strolling distance to main attractions and plentiful cafes and restaurants. A real find, beautifully furnished room - stayed in room 5 with its french windows overlooking the garden, with the added bonus of an outside seating area. Peaceful surroundings, a perfect place to unwind after a day's sightseeing.

<Content>We could not have asked for more Seven Bridges is truly a special hotel. We were anticipating the beautiful period decor and picturesque canal location, but the charm of our room and the warm hospitality of G眉nter and Pierre surpassed expectations. My husband and I were there for four days in September following a couple of weeks on safari in Kenya. Our immaculate, comfortable room was a great place to reacclimatize and a luxurious way to begin and end our days of sightseeing walks and boat excursions through lovely Amsterdam. It is located on a quiet street and canal yet is convenient to good restaurants, cafes and the museums. I would never stay anyplace else. Thank you Pierre and G眉nter for making our first visit to your beautiful city a wonderful memory.

<Content>Simply Wonderful I have just returned from a three night stay at the Seven Bridges Hotel.It was simply wonderful. I had consulted this website before booking the trip as suprise birthday present for my boyfriend. I almost expected to be let down on arrival because it seemed impossible that it could live up to the rave reviews. But it did. And it did it in such a charming, effortless way that this was the most relaxing holiday I think I have ever had. In fact, contrary to the review previous to this one, I don't think I've ever had a better night's sleep. Our room (number 8) was charming, clean and very well decorated. We were served the finest breakfast in our rooms and the hotel staff were incrediably accomodating. The even managed to satisfy my hunger with delicious jams and breads so that I was not at all envious of my boyriend's coffee and croissants which I cannot eat because of an allergy. The location of the hotel was also top notch and I wish that I had been able to stay for longer. It is not possible to give this hotel anything but 5 out of 5.If you do decide to stay there, please do not be put off by the two beds in room 8 rather than one double, they are a very generous size and are simply a slightly smaller version of a double.

<Content>Over rated We just came back from a 3 night stay at this hotel. The room ( # 6 ) is very small and obviously the web site photos are very unrealistic. Furthermore facing the street and canal you are assured of sleepless nights from all the party goers at nearby Rembrandtplein.We stayed at hotel Pita 2 years ago and although not as central as Seven bridges at least we were able to sleep at night.

<Content>What a very special hotel! This is a very special hotel for people who appreciate staying in a genuine canal-side house rather than a plastic hotel that you could find in any city in the world. The staff were very kind and helpful, the rooms delightful, breakfast delicious and the whole experience one I will remember for ever. We went there for a very special birthday - we loved Amsterdam - and a stay at the Seven Bridges Hotel just made the whole trip perfect. We spent a lot of time just savouring the view and watching the comings and goings on the street and on the canal.

<Content>Lovely Stay at the Seven Bridges My husband and I stayed at the Seven Bridges for 3 nights in August. The location is outstanding. The friendliness, service and helpfulness of the owners/staff are unparalelled. We especially enjoyed Gunther's restaurant recommendations! Rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated. Cleaning service was excellent and discreet. Breakfast was simple but hearty, allowing us to focus on our sightseeing and excellent dinners, rather than looking for b-fast elsewhere. Overall a great experience, which we will highly recommend to our friends and family! Seven Bridges recently appeared in an article about Amsterdam in National Geographic Traveler (in an issue we picked up in the airport on the way there) so book early!

<Content>Surpassed our expectations My boyfriend and I stayed in this gem of a hotel for two nights and I wish it could have been longer. We booked it on the strength ot all the good rewiews on Trip Advisor and I can honestly say it surpassed our (already high) expectations. The owners are really so nice and make you feel welcome as soon as you arrive. The room was gorgeous and so comfortable. The location is great, on a lovely quiet canal but just two minutes walk to a great selection of restaurants and bars. The breakfast, which is served in your room on lovely china was really good and kept us going until after lunchtime each day. All in all, we can find no fault with this lovely hotel and will definately stay there again when we return to Amsterdam. It definately was a major part of our brilliant weekend in the city.

<Content>quiet and charming hotel I have just returned from staying here with a friend. The hotel is lovely, well decorated and very very clean. We both really liked our room- with two double beds it was big enough to give us both some privacy and we had a beautiful view over the garden. We couldn't belive how quiet it was especially as we were so near to the bars, coffee shops and places to eat. We slept very well after all the walking and sight seeing. We were, like other people, in awe of the breakfasts being delivered up all those stairs. Thank you to Gunter and Pierre for looking after us so well. We will definitely be returning again for another visit.

<Content>Amazing place to stay We stayed in Room 5. It was lovely and massive. Had breakfast on the private terrace overlooking the garden. Really enjoyed staying here. Unique and in a lovely part of Amsterdam within walking distance of everything. Enjoyed not seeing anybody at all. Very unpretentious. Went to really nice Italian restaurant on the corner of the same street which I would also recommend.

<Content>Great location for Gay Pride visitors We stayed at Seven Bridges during this year Gay Pride Weekend. This small, charming, friendly hotel met all of our expectations. The room, view, location and communication with staff were all amazing. We stayed in the room no. 6 with canal view, equipped with nice pieces of furniture and huge behind the bed mirror. Hotel has a absolutely perfert location for Gay Pride visitors, just one hop to canal parade, to street party, also to all other city attractions, everything is within 10 minutes walking distance. I was really surprised, how quite was the street and the room even during this very busy days and nights, when thousands of visitors are dancing on the nearby streets. Equipped with our own key from the building, we were our own masters, not slaves of receptionist or consierge, as in some big chain hotels.Breakfast served each morning in the room is a really athletic achievement for Gunter (I admire you:-)) Sufficient amount of coffee, tea, ham, cheese, juice, jogurt, bread, rolls. We only missed some fruit or vegetables, but understand because of limited space on the breakfast tray.We were satisfied in all aspects and hope to come again,Martina and Kristina

<Content>Two Germans at Seven Bridges plus unusual sightseeing tips This has been a wonderful stay, for one night only - unfortunately. We truly enjoyed the unique atmosphere, the two owners' kindness, and for sure the beautiful room which is full of antiques.Located in the centre of the town these two neat and knowledgable guys will fill you in with any information you might need for making your trip to Amsterdam as much fun as can be. One of them being German helped a lot in this respect.As an unexpected add-on a Tibetan Buddhist center is right next door where you can join meditation sessions and find a well-assorted bookshop. What was the biggest surprise was the fact that in two minutes walking distance you will find Amsterdam's most beautiful garden as part of Geelvinck Hinlopen Huis museum (-). This is still an insder info as this musuem only opened in Feb 06. Have a coffee in the mystic garden and enjoy chatting with one of Amsterdam's Grand Dames who is running the museum and actually is inhabiting it.Coming from Hamburg we are familiar with high priced parking lots. But man Amsterdam is cheeky. They will ask EUR 3,40 per hour ! So if you are lucky (as we were) to find a parking lot right in front of Seven Bridges, have a lot of small change ready to feed this parking machine. It will not accept bank notes, but only coins. So, if you want to stay over night ... ask at Seven Bridges for not as high piced alternatives.Having said that it's been a great trip and we will come back definitely to enjoy Seven Bridges and this beautiful city.Best wishes to the two of you and to all who are lucky to stay for a night or longer at Seven Bridges.Gabriele  Eric

<Content>As good as the reviews said it was We stayed 3 nights in July and it was truly excellent. We had room 4 which overlooks the garden and seems to be really quiet It was very hot in Amsterdam and it was a godsend to be at the back of the building away from the direct sun. The room was clean, the breakfast excellent, and the staff all very helpful. I would not hesitate to go back again or recommend others to go there. The hotel is well located in a nice quite canal area, within walking distance of all the sites.

<Content>Brilliant Hotel My wife and I have just returned from Amsterdam after five nights at the Seven Bridges Hotel. I booked the room in April after reading rave reviews on Tripadvisor and was surprised to read a negative review just before we set off in July. I have to say I cannot understand how this hotel and particularly our room (no 7) could get anything other than a fab review. The room is large and extremely tastefully furnished and the view from the windows which form one whole side of the room is stunning as it looks over the canal and you can see some of the seven bridges. The location is fantastic only a short walk from Rembrandtplein and a choice of trams to any part of the city. The breakfast, served in your room on Villeroy and Boch china, is more than you need with superb coffee and enough to keep you going all day until evening with perhaps a very light snack through the day.I cannot recomment this hotel more highly. Check the web site sevenbridgeshotel.nl the chairs in room 7 are now wonderful Louis XV fauteuils purchased recently at Christies.

<Content>We had a wonderful time at the Seven Bridges Hotel My daughters, who are 22 years old, and I had a lovely stay at the Seven Bridges Hotel in Amsterdam. The location is just perfect... on a pretty canal street within walking distance of everything. Our two room suite in the building two doors down from the actual hotel had a small refrigerator and a hot water pot, and tea and cups for a relaxing spot of tea before of after sightseeing. We had a wonderful three window view of the canal, and the street was very peaceful. Gunter had the foresight to include a glass vase for the flowerws we bought at the flower market which we enjoyed during our three day stay there. The furnishings were very pleasing and the accomodations spacious. The futon which was in the second room was a perfect place to sleep. The rooms were airy and very comfortable.We got perfect directions to and from the train station using the tram. Gunter was very helpful to me when I left something at the hotel and will be sending this forgotten itme to me in the states. I highly recommend this hotel for a stay of any lenght in Amsterdam. I would certainly stay here again and recommend the Seven Bridges to my friends as well.

<Content>Fabulous Find My husband and I have just returned from a week in Amsterdam. We found this hotel through a travel book on Amsterdam and then verified the reviews through Trip Advisor prior to booking. There was no room available in the hotel so they put us up at an apartment belonging to the hotel next door. It was a studio suite with bathroom (shower), kitchen sink, stove and fridge, double bed and T.V. It was very comfortable and private. We never saw anyone from the hotel unless we wanted to. If we had any questions, we popped over to the main hotel. There was daily maid service too but unlike the hotel, no breakfast. Initially I was disappointed that they wouldn't be offering breakfast but in the end it was okay because it gave us the freedom to eat when and what we wanted and we had the fridge to store any groceries we bought. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Amsterdam. The proprietor, Mr. Glaner is very helpful and friendly.

<Content>Wow I love this extraordinary hotel. I have stayed there twice, May 99 and June 06. The rooms are the most beautiful examples of the long tradition of Dutch excellence in decoration using a charming ecclectic style. Each room is unique with beautiful oriental rugs, leather chairs, elaborate tilework, and mirrors which are cleverly placed to reflect architectural details. The excellent service is discreet, the rooms VERY clean. A true Amsterdam experience located two blocks from Rembrandtplein on the most beautiful canal in the city. I just would not stay anywhere else.

<Content>Loved it This hotel is perfect, its in a gorgeous location, overlooking the canal and easy walking distance to anywhere you will likely want to go to, with many bars and resturants nearby. We stayed in room 9, which even though was at the top of a severe staircase (i did feel sorry for them who ever brought our breakfast up each morning, thank you Gunter) was absolutly charming, clean and everything you needed. Amsterdam is a beautiful city and we really loved staying at this hotel, which made our stay even more enjoyable. Thank you Seven Bridges Hotel.

<Content>Home Away From Home Besides a terrific location (near lots of good restaurants, museums, yet quiet and peaceful)and a very friendly and helpful staff, staying at the Seven Bridges was like having our own small apartment. We had accommodations with two beds and two rooms (plus frig to keep food/drink available). Can't imagine a more inviting place to stay in Amsterdam!!

<Content>Everyone should stay here at least once as for me I'll stay again I guess it depends on what a person likes, I like antiques and good beds with lots of covers, hot coffee and croissants served to my room on pretty china and friendly faces in the morning. My room was # 5 it was beautiful and spacious with it's own bath and a shower with wonderful and plentiful hot water. It had a terrace overlooking gardens that we spent alot of time on. Gunter and Pierre couldn't have been nicer, even when we caused that little electrical accident. I was able to see most of the other rooms before I left and would have stayed in any of them, I just happen to like the one with the terrace the best. If you stay there tell them Donna Hodges says hi.

<Content>Charm  June 4th,2006Reviewer: From New York CityJust returned from a 5 day stay at Hotel Seven Bridges-a beautiful historic canal house very centrally located (an easy walk to Anne Frank ,House, Van Gogh Museum  other major Amsterdam attractions). We stayed in room #7 which had large windows overlooking a canal. The room was quite spacious and contained lovely antique furniture as well as a roomy bathroom which had beautiful white tiles accented with a floral design and the floor was done in a rustic ceramic(probably Italian) tile-this gave it all a very clean look  cleanliness is the operative word for the entire room. We loved being served our breakfast in our room while we sat in plush leather chairs at the exquisite marble table. The innkeepers, Gunter  Pierre, couldn't be more accommodating and they take great pride in the decor they have created. We had an opportunity to see room #5-which is like a palace! It's quite large  is appointed with some gorgeous antiques. It also has it's own garden space where one can sit  have breakfast  plan the day. There are also some great restaurants in the area within a 5-10 minute walk.

<Content>Character hotel Despite being aprehensive after a bad review three days before going, we really enjoyed our stay in room 6. The views of the canal from the room were gorgeous, the unusual Art Deco room was beautiful and very clean. We loved having breakfast served in our room where we could watch the world go by at our leisure through the huge picture window.Very handy for bars, coffee shops and restaurants yet a lovely peaceful location. No smoking (understandable given the standard of the furnishings) so we enjoyed our morning nicotine outside taking in the views.Staff were very friendly and accomodating,staying late at reception due to our 10pm landing and also arranged a taxi for our return flight. We look forward to staying again. Thank you very much!

<Content>Great stay at Seven Bridges Hotel Myself, a travel agent, and 2 friends stayed at Seven Bridges Hotel for a week recently. We were not disappointed. We stayed in #5, the biggest  most special room with a private terrace  to-die-for antigues. Breakfast ( brewed coffee, croissants, assorted fresh breads, cheese, meat  yogurt) brought to us each morning  served on real china. Antiques are amazing. Big bathroom with good-sized shower and PLENTY of hot water. Our hosts, Gunter  Pierre, showed us all 8 of the rooms and we thought they were all just charming. Location 1 block from Rembrandtplein is another plus. You can walk just about anywhere from here. Too bad the weather was rainy, windy  cold but we still had a very memorable and enjoyable experience and recommend Seven Bridges for anyone visiting Amsterdam.

<Content>CLEAN AND SPOTLESS I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Seven Bridges Hotel in early May 2006 and was impressed at the condition of the hotel and the upgraded services from previous visits. For someone to say that this hotel is anything other than perfectly maintained is misleading. Perhaps the reviewer who thought the hotel not up to snuff is more familiar with the sort of artificial anitiquity one can find at Disneyland or Las Vegas. This hotel is the real thing. An elegant well staffed and maintained hotel. I stayed here days before the persons who said it needs a good cleaning and I completely disagree. Everything was perfect as usual. I have nothing to complain about. The breakfast by the way is something I always look forward to before arriving, for me it is very special and a wonderful welcome to the day ahead. I would not stay anywhere else in Amsterdam. This hotel has true character.

<Content>Charming Oasis in Vibrant Amsterdam We stayed at Seven Bridges for six nights in early May of 2006. Our room, Apartment C, was not in the hotel itself, but rather in the annex two doors away. The only drawback of staying in the annex is that you do not get breakfast. But the apartment has a small refrigerator and you can purchase breakfast fixings in the neighborhood, thus having exactly what you want for breakfast whenever you want it. Cups, glasses and silverware are provided as well as a water heater and instant coffee. The primary advantage of staying in the annex is total independence. Upon arrival you are given a key to enter the building and one for the apartment, allowing you to come and go as you please. Someone miraculously appears while you are out to leave the place spotless every day. There is no contact with staff next door unless you need them. They kindly provided us with an adapter plug when we realized that we had left ours at home and forwarded our telephone messages efficiently. Check in and out was handled quickly and easily. The apartment itself is lovely 鈥?located on the first floor up a typically narrow Amsterdam staircase. The sitting room is nicely furnished and has three large windows with a beautiful view of the charming canal below. The bedroom is separated from the sitting room by a glass partition and has a good firm queen size bed. The bathroom has all the needed conveniences. Several large mirrors make the place feel even larger than it is. The neighborhood is ideal with friendly locals (both human and feline) and plenty of excellent restaurants. The hotel is within easy walking distance of several museums, the Opera and tram lines that will take you anywhere you might want to go. At night, it is very quiet and we had no trouble sleeping even with the windows open. We had ideal weather, but a possible drawback in the summer might be mosquitoes. There were a few in early May and if the quantity were larger, one would want to keep the windows closed 鈥?a possible drawback on a hot day. So why didn鈥檛 I give the place 鈥渇ive stars鈥? Small quibbles. Although there are two dressers with drawers sufficient to store your clothes, there is no real closet and little space to hang things up 鈥?a small inconvenience during an extended stay. Also, it would have been nice if the bars of soap were somewhat larger. The tiny bars (that seem to vanish after one shower) are okay for a one or two night stay, but larger bars would have been appreciated for six days. Might I also suggest that shampoo be provided 鈥?a not unreasonable amenity to expect for the price?All in all, highly recommended. We will definitely return.

<Content>Needs a good cleaning! May, 2006 This could be a charming hotel. It is conveniently located by some of the most popular art museums. Our room overlooking the canal had a great view. And the staff were helpful. Also, the breakfast brought to your room added a romantic touch (although the food was nothing special). But it needs a good cleaning (especially the carpets) and it is looking worn and a bit shabby. If this place wants to keep its reputation as one of the top guest house/small hotels, it needs to start working!

<Content>Loved Seven Bridges! We just returned from five nights in Amsterdam where we stayed at the Seven Bridges Hotel. Location is perfect, a few blocks from Rembrandtsplein and multiple tram stops, a 10=15 minute walk from the Rijksmuseum, but quiet and peaceful at the same time. It's a wonderful retreat from the busy city. We also found many good restaurants within a few blocks, including Thai, Rijstaafel, and Italian. The room was lovely with a beautiful canal view. Though not huge, it was space enough and very homey. If you're looking for something more expansive, room #5 seemed large and had its own little outdoor patio (it was on the garden, not canal, side). Everything is clean and creatively decorated. Each day began sitting by the window eating the breakfast brought to our room on china and watching the passersby along the canal. There were vast quantities of breads, croissant, yogurt, sliced cheese and turkey, along with juice, coffee and tea. You can even make lunch with the leftovers and carry it with you for a picnic! My only recommendation would be to vary the breakfast a little - even if it's just changing the types of breads or pastries, or perhaps a different cheese or even slice of quiche. The hosts were unobtrusive but helpful when asked. They even let us make short calls to our kids back in the States for free, and let me check-in for our return flight on their computer. All in all, it's a wonderful place to stay-quiet, perfect location, lovely room and courteous, professional staff. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Lovely and private I have been fortunate enough to stay at the Seven Bridges five times in the past six years, and I would not want to stay anywhere else in Amsterdam. A canalhouse-turned-boutique hotel, the Seven Bridges is situated in a landmark district and lovingly decorated with early-twentieth-century antiques. While it has the feel of a particularly comfortable private home, the location just off Rembrandtplein is wonderfully central and convenient. The Seven Bridges offers an illusion of seclusion in the midst of the city's metropolitan center.

<Content>Wonderful This is a beautiful hotel - quiet, elegant, and friendly. Our room was full of wonderful antiques, and was spotlessly clean. Breakfast was brought to us on bone china every morning. The area is chic and central, but at night the streets are silent. We stayed for 5 nights and couldn't have been happier.

<Content>Beautiful location Highly recommended. The location on a beautiful canal, quiet, near Rembrandtplein, good restaurants, and walking distance from nearly everything else is hard to beat. Good size rooms, some quite luxurious, nice breakfast served in room. Only lacks a central living room/lobby area. (Stayed here 6 days.)

<Content>reserve in advance and stay for 5 days! Imagine that you want to make reservations for 3 nights in a hotel and you check availablity 4 months ahead. The hotel tells you that bookings can only be made 2 months in advance, so you go back 2 months before your scheduled arrival date. Quess what? Fully booked!! Oh yeah they forgot to tell that bookings in excess of 4 days can be made anytime of the year... How would you feel? The hotel where this happened? Right: The seven bridge hotel.

<Content>our new home in amsterdam We are usually in Amsterdam (on holiday) two to four times a year. The owners of our usual hotel, Els and Yvo of the Hotel Agora, sold their hotel in October of 2005. So we decided, at their recommendation, to try the Seven Bridges Hotel. We were just there a few days ago for five nights. We have found our new hotel!!!Pierre Keulers and Gunter Glaner, the owners, have a beautiful, small, intimate hotel. They provide excellent service and are very helpful. The rooms are incredible--oriental rugs, comfortable chairs and beds, and all are imaginatively decorated. The canal side rooms have wonderful views and the garden side rooms have green, soothing views. A huge breakfast is brought to your room at the time you request on fine china.On arrival, we paid cash for all five nights. On our departure, Pierre and Gunter both saw us off and gave us our receipt with wishes for a safe journey. On our future journeys, the Seven Bridges will be our home in Amsterdam!

<Content>Started the year out the right way..... My husband, brother-in-law and I started out the new year at Hotel Seven Bridges. From the moment we arrived, we were treated courteously, yet always given our space. The entire staff was always ready and willing to accomodate us with various requests, i.e. making restaurant reservations, checking into concert performances and ticket availability, serving all breakfasts in our larger room and exactly when we requested it, etc. It was a joy to begin the year in one of our favorite cities and be able to retreat to the cosy warmth and welcome of the Seven Bridges. We can't wait to return.

<Content>Wonderful and warm atmosphere, great service We celebrated the 40th birthday of my husband in this charming hotel in my home town Amsterdam. It was a surprise stay for my husband, and I wanted to give him a champagne breakfast. The management was very helpful, and helped me whereever they could. I brought them a bottle of champagne, they cooled the bottle in their fridge until the morning of my husbands birthday, and served it together with the breakfast and a big smile. I asked lots of friends to send a birthday card to the hotel, in the days before our stay. The management collected all the cards and served them also together with the breakfast. All this extra service was totally free. The hotel-owners even gave my husband a present: a cd with classical music. We felt very welcome and enjoyed the warm atmosphere of the Seven Bridges hotel very much.

<Content>Wonderful hotel, lovely people, charming room, great service We love this hotel. We travel to Amsterdam frequently to visit our son, daughter-in-law and new grandson. The location is perfect. The room is lovely, clean, spacious and quiet, we enjoyed the view of the garden. Pierre, Gunther and Eric are lovely, always, pleasant, always there to help and yet they are private people as we are. The breakfast is delicious and served in your room which is very nice. We had absolutely no problems with our reservations, with our payments or anything else. The whole experience was a happy one. We were so complimentary about our stay, our family wanted to come and see our room. Thank you Pierre, Gunther and Eric. It is truly one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in and for that reason, it is unforgettable.

<Content>Wonderful place! The Seven Bridges Hotel is a beautiful little place, an excellent location, with exceptional staff. The rooms are both quaint and eclectic, and many have canal views. The rooms are very clean, and were well attended to each day of our stay. The owners were incredibly helpful, and made our trip to Amsterdam a complete pleasure. The price of the rooms was a value compared to some of the other rooms available in other hotels. As some have noted, it is sort of a mix between a hotel and BB, and is very quiet, with broadband internet connections in every room, some with mini-refrigerators.I have to admit that when I ran across this website, I read through some of the reviews below out of curiosity, 95% of which are quite accurate. As far as the ones stating that the owners had tried to double-charge them... Well, I have a very, very difficult time believing this now that I've stayed at the Seven Bridges. The staff of the Seven Bridges was incredibly helpful, especially given our unique circumstances, and I'm certain that they would never, ever intentionally try to cheat someone.I highly recommend the Seven Bridges, and if I am ever in Amsterdam again, I will go out of my way to assure that I can again stay at this exceptional place.

<Content>Charming hotel in a great location We loved staying here, and would go back in a heartbeat. The owners were gracious and helpful - in fact, they rescued us when the internet reservation we'd made elsewhere didn't work out. The neighborhood is charming and conveniently located near the museums and Rembrandtplein. Our room was tastefully decorated with a loving eye and combination of styles that was elegant and comfortable too. Our room overlooked the verdant back garden and was very quiet at night. The rooms have mini-refrigerators, TVS, phones and Internet access -- all the modern conveniences in a charming and comfortable setting.

<Content>Seven Bridges; good but not that special I booked this hotel well in advance since everywhere else seemed full up and the reviews were so good. We asked for one of the back rooms at cheaper rate (110 euros for double b and b) for three nights. It was easy to find; we took the train from the airport (ticket machines don't take cash and wouldn't accept our cash cards so we should have just queued at the counter). And then straight out to the trams and on to a number 4 (bought the tickets on board, asked for Prinsengraght). From the stop it was a short walk to Seven Bridges. The reception was v efficient and we were directed straight to our room on the ground floor at the back (Number 4 I think). The room was very pleasant with large open windows looking out on to a tree filled back garden/yard (no view). The bed was v comfortable with lovely cotton sheets and pillows. The shower room was fine, soft towels etc. The other reviews rave about this place; we thought it was a great location and an ok hotel. It actually felt quite impersonal and I don't think we saw any other residents although it was full. It was difficult to get a conversation from the receptionist; i guess it is just a quiet reserved place. You could choose your breakfast time from 8 to 9am. I thought this was a bit tight since the only thing which would actually need preparing was the tea or coffee (they could have sorted the trays at 7am and been a bit more flexible for us lazy late starters). I know they started preparing at 7am since our room backed on to the kitchen and they woke me up each morning making a load of noise. Would have commented on this to the staff but wasn't asked if I had enjoyed my stay so tdidn't bother mentioning it. The breakfast was lovely fresh croissant, orange juice, breads and hams and cheese. On the first day we has yoghurt too but didn;t eat it and never got any more!Ermm I would say that this a nice safe clean functional hotel (well, more of a b and b really)in a good location but it's not cheap and it isn't quite as special as the other reviewers try to make out. Having said that we had a great stay and enjoyed coming and going from the hotel with no hassle.

<Content>A beautiful little hotel We stayed at the Seven Bridges Hotel in Amsterdam five years ago, and again at the beginning of August this year. It is a beautiful, well-run retreat from the crowds of Amsterdam in the summer. There are 8 rooms, each one carefully and comfortably furnished, each one different from the others. The hotel is very quiet and peaceful, despite it's location close to Rembrandt Square. It is easy to walk anywhere in the city from there, and there are restaurants nearby. Breakfast, which is a very complete continental with several kinds of breads, cheese, ham and yoghurt, is served on lovely china and is brought to the rooms. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Book ahead for this one!

<Content>My favorite hotel in Holland I always stay at this hotel when I stay in Amsterdam (I regularly go to Europe for business). The nicely furnished rooms and special breakfasts only add to its charm and provide a real break from the run-of-the-mill megahotels I usually stay at. If you want peace and quiet, try to take one of the rooms in the back. If you like watching tourists passing by beneath your window, take a room on the front side.

<Content>Fraudulent credit card transaction I you look back at a review from March the 1st 2005, you will see a complaint from a customer who paid by cash and was charged by credit card also. I stayed at the Hotel seven Bridges for a few days and left on the 4th of April 2005. They did exactly the same thing to me. They took a cash payment and then charged my credit card for the same amount. They are currently under investigation. DO NOT....I repeat....DO NOT book this hotel as there is enormous risk involved. They are not to be trusted.Their modus operandae is to take a cash payment and THEN charge your card. They have taken 拢321.00 sterling from me and did not have the decency to phone me to explain this, I had to phone them at which point they told me that it was just 'fantasy'. This is nothing more than reality. PLEASE ignore any reply that they make, it is simply not worth putting yourself in this kind of position. You have been warned.................

<Content>My favorite home away from home I have stayed several times in the charming Seven Bridges Hotel and can recommend it to anybody who likes to have a tast of an old Amsterdam canal house. It is charming and very well furnished. Although not inexpensive it is worth a visit.With kind regards,Gerry Winters

<Content>Perfection On the Canal This was our first stay at The Seven Bridges. Since we visit Amsterdam--one of the truly wonderful cities in Europe--at least twice a year, it won't be the last. If we're lucky. I write this rave review with some concern--concern that the next time we try to book the hotel, TripAdvisor readers will already have snared MY room!This hotel has two owners/managers (Pierre  Gunther) and several assistants, including the superb Eric. They somehow manage to care for the guests (and I talked with seven other guests over our week's stay) as if they were house guests. When I requested a firmer pillow it was followed up. And when a change of linens meant a change to a duvet, Pierre asked if we were comfortable with the new bed treatment. At the same time, they are not obtrusive in the least--one could stay there and have a conversation only at check-in and check-out if that would be preferred.The room service breakfasts were just about perfect--we wouldn't change a thing. And the cleanliness of the individually-designed and furnished rooms was at the ultimate world standard--namely, the Dutch standard!Now, remember fellow TripAdvisor members--PLEASE DON'T BOOK WHEN I WANT TO BOOK AT THIS EXCELLENT HOTEL IN AMSTERDAM!!

<Content>Would Stay There Again and Again I have been to Amsterdam a half-dozen times in the last few years, and Seven Bridges is where I will stay the next time and the time after that. The location is nearly unbeatable. The view from canal-side rooms is unbeatable. The rooms are charming, spotless and spacious. The price was right. I have paid a lot more for standard Amsterdam charmless fare, but I won't again.

I think the problem is that some rooms are quite a lot better than others and so you're taking a chance that you will get one of the good ones. Ours was right on the top flooor and it was quite nice, on the small side but quite cosy. The bathroom wasn't much to write home about, there was no bath (I think there are showers only at this hotel), and no toiletries. The assorted bread rolls at breakfast (there is no restuarant so its breakfast in bed every day!) were very good. As a previous reviewer has mentioned it would have been nice to have juice. My partner doesn't drink tea or coffee in the morning and although we requested juice instead for him it never came. There was no explanation and this happened twice. I think maybe they meant to buy juice but forgot.So although the attention to detail in this hotel is good in some areas such as eclectic furnishings, in other areas they just don't seem bothered. As I paid 拢100 per night for the room it wasn't good value for money for me- small room  poor service. I think this hotel is coasting on its past reputation as an undiscovered treasure, but as it has become more popular they have become complacent.

<Content>dishonest management We stayed at Hotel Seven Bridges for a few nights in October 2004. The evening before we departed I went to the owner and said I wanted to settle our bill as we were leaving early the next morning. He said he did not have time to do it then. The next morning , October 8, 2004, as we were leaving for the airport to return home to Portland, I went to the owner and paid him the 240Euros due. I paid him in cash and asked for a receipt. He acted indignant and said he was out of receipts and did not have time to go get more since he had to run the place alone. As we had a plane to catch, I was unable to do anything other than write down the amount I paid him in my spiral notebook. I signed a blank VISA paper when we checked in and I was told it would be destroyed if I paid cash,WHICH I DID. Imagine my surprise when VISA said I owed for three nights lodging and they had a signed receipt for 10/21/04......ten days after we were home and back at work! I think the Seven Bridges acted fraudulently and advise youto be ware.

<Content>Top floor canal-facing room is amazing Stayed at this wonderful hotel during August of 2003. The top floor room that faces the canal is a real treat. Manuevering the tiny flights with luggage is worth the effort when you open your door and see an amazing bank of windows. They all open in to afford one beautiful canal scene - it feels as if you are in treehouse. The breakfast was one that you dream of being greeted with every day......

<Content>Charming with Character We visited Amsterdam at the beginning of October 2004 and stayed here for 4 nights. Our room on the 1st floor has a nice view looking out into the street and canal. The other bedroom in the 1st floor (which we managed to peek through as it was being cleaned) was much larger and has nice views over a garden. As it is a quiet area (and yet only one block from Rembrandtplein), there was not too much noise from the streets to be a bother.The room itself was decent and spacious although there could be more amenities in the bathroom (just small pieces of soap). The breakfast in the room is a nice treat (but could be better with juice). Those steep stairs were a bit tough with the luggage but I think you find these in almost all such places in Amsterdam.It is a nice charming place with character. We didn't encounter any other guests during our stay (which for us is a good thing) and the owners were friendly without being overly so. Recommended for someone who likes something other than a large chain hotel experience!

<Content>A wonderful place to stay and while away the time I've been going to Amsterdam for some 12 years now for a yearly convention in September.I was lucky to read a write-up about the Hotel for my first trip to this lovely City, and can heartily recommend it. (Of course, perhaps too effusive praise will make rooms even more difficult to rent....!)Pierre  Gunther are the calm, welcoming hosts. They do just enough to make you feel at home, but don't pry or try for any forced cheeriness. I recommend the 2nd floor of the second building. You can sit in the perfect little drawing room with sun streaming through the window, with the peaceful Reguliersgracht in front, viewable through the trees. If you enjoy peace and romance, this Hotel is for you.
