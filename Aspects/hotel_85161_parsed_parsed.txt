<Content>Terrible experience It was just a waste of money!! Rooms were so dirty.. especially the restroom was a total horror.. toilet seat was worn out with a rusted look.. too congested.. dirty floor.. We had booked for 2 days, so we had no other option.. but to stay there restless.. Reception staff were too rude, he gave a lame excuse that the building was 45 yrs old.. I dont understand how they can charge this much money for a ditch.. After reading the horrible reviews, still i took a risk of staying there.. NEVER AGAIN!!!

<Content>Health Hazard - Don't risk your health to stay in this hotel We stayed in this hotel just for one night but we had horible experience. The room was so dirty and bath room was worsen than public bath room. All of above there was so much bugs in the room we could not sleep the whole night. When we woke up next day we had about 15-20 bug bites. It's all swolen and very itchy. First the price looked OK for the good location but risking our health is not worth it, even after 4 days the whole body is itching and bites are very painful. When we called the hotel back they did not care and asked what we can do for you. Then we spoke to some one in the hotel they mentioned it's been a common problem in the hotel and they don't care.

<Content>Budget Motel- Unlikely to Return We chose this motel for the lower price and prime location knowing that it had some poor reviews- so we were prepared when the expected happened. My friend parked his car in the lot adjacent to the motel where they provide valet parking. His car was broken into with items stolen while in the monitored lot. Motel management took no responsibility and would not even reimburse him the parking lot fee of $20 paid the night of the break-in.The dead-bolt security locks have been mysteriously removed from all motel room doors. As a single woman, I did not feel very safe/secure when a repair person came right into my room while I was in the shower. He left right away when he realized the room was occupied- but still- not a safe feeling for me.Lots of tiny ants in the bathroom and room- but don't worry- they don't eat much!!1st floor rooms very noisy from foot traffic in the rooms on the 2nd floor- not conducive to sleeping. Daytime manager (male) has a very gruff personality and demeanor. If you are persistent and repeatedly ask for what you need, than the other staff on day and night shifts seem more than willing to assist you. Overall this motel has a long way to go to improve cleanliness, safety, parking lot security, consistent customer service and convenience.

<Content>Great Location I stayed at this hotel over Labor Day weekend and the location was amazing. Just steps from the beach! The restaurant outside the hotel served a great breakfast- ORDER THE OMLET! Rooms were very clean, bedding was comfortable. Only issues I had was the air conditioning, you arent able to control it from your room, each floor has its own setting. Other than that the hotel was wonderful! would definetly go back again!

<Content>Not perfect but worth the money After reading all the horror stories on this hotel, 2 days before we left our home in Belgium, my family and me prepared for a visit and leave to another hotel....But once we arrived we got a good reception and were happy to see that the 2 computers do work perfectly. We found our rooms in just 3 minutes, witch is nice after a 20 hours trip..., we got 2 clean airconditioned rooms with view on a little clean swimmimg pool.We took a look at our rooms and found 2 very clean rooms with clean sheets and beds. The rooms looked like the ones on the website from the hotel.The lady at the recepton, Sonja i think, immediatly told us that we could use all the accomodations from the Deauville that is 2 minutes walk from the Bay Breeze. We went there to use the internet, the pool and the beach accomodations. Got 4 towels at the pool service without a problem. Also the reception there was friendly to us...We stayed 3 nights and our rooms were cleaned every day at about 10 o clock. I must add that the beds are really confortable!Is this hotel perfect? Not really, there was for example only 1 fridge in 1 of the 2 rooms we occupied. The bathroom was clean but very old. But you could see that the staff was doing what they could to keep everithing working. We got clean towels every day.There was no safe in the room. You can have no breakfast at the hotel but that is mentionned on their website and we knew that from our reservation... We went to a nearby donuts shop and had brekfast near the pool every morning...If i have one complaint, than it would be the man from the valet parking who spoke no English and came over quite rude to tell us we had to pay for the parking, but when he sensed that we kept it friendly he also changed and was friendly too.So i can say, the hotel was what we expected for the price we payd... I have been in worse rooms that i paid a lot more for.

<Content>My first stay at the BBH I visited the US in April 2008 and stayed at the Bay Breeze Hotel in Miami Beach. As I was looking for some kind of bargain on the net, I found the BBH would be just right for two weeks: an affordable hotel and still have enough money on hand to get around and have a good time. (For a bit more insight: I was visiting from Germany, but I was born in the States and have been living in Germany for many years. Now I鈥檝e decided to move back to the US and used my vacation to take a look at Miami.)I arrived in sunny Miami at around 5 pm. I took the J-bus and reached the hotel at around 7 pm. After the long tripfrom overseas, I called it a day and was happy to get to my room.My first impression wasn鈥檛 that good though: the room looked a little worn, it wasn鈥檛 very tidy and the window overlooked a parking lot with the air conditioners of the building next door at full blast, quite annoying that night.The next morning I talked to the manager about this. He assured me that they were working on improving the state of the hotel and set me up with a much nicer room; good condition, sunny and at poolside. As the BBH doesn鈥檛 have a breakfast room or any equivalent, I was told that the Deauville, a few minutes down the road, offered breakfast. Afterwards I usually went out for the day; sightseeing, swimming, shopping and so on. All in all I had a good time: the manager and the hotel employees were very nice and considerate towards me and they helped me out with my questions and queries. Of course, I could have checked in to a much higher priced hotel, but with my limited budget, it worked out fine for me. The beach is a five minute walk from the hotel. There is also a good (and affordable!) public transportation system with bus stops in a few minutes reach that get you into town or to South Beach. So, if you don鈥檛 need the whole plushy business, like it simple and prefer to get around, check out the BBH.

<Content>Very Nice stay at Bay Breeze Miami Beach. A very nice stay at Bay Breeze Hotel in Miami Beach...Accomodations were very good, hot water, nice beds, TV, AC...I;ve enjoyed the stay there...no bad comments to do, there is a swimming pool but I could not try because of the storm but for sure that looked nice as well.From my point of view is a recommendable site to spend your stay in Miami Beach.

<Content>Sketchy, but works on a budget We booked this place because it was spring break and we wanted to be in South Beach. We arrived not really knowing what to expect. Walking to the room my heart sank because it was SO dirty and pipes were sticking out and it just looked VERY sketchy. We got in our room and things didn't really improve. We spent the next hour trying to see how we could get our money back for the prepaid room and also to find a room somewhere else. Neither worked out. Once I relaxed a little, it all set in and I was just like you know what...it's just for sleeping. We travel with locks on our bags so theft wasn't an issue, we moved the table in front of the door while sleeping just because it did seem rather questionable but at the end of the day....it had hot water, decent enough bathroom and a bed. Not to mention that the area, at least to the eye was great! Super little restaurant about 2 doors down with free internet, and practically right on the bus route, so hop the bus for a dollar and something and head whereever you want. Only about a 20 minute ride down to the South Beach strip. There was also a great balcony on the room. Sure, not much for a view....but coming from the snowy north, I don't need a view...just the heat!So as long as you can hack the horror movie set look to the place, it's not THAT bad. If you can't afford the other places, it'll do just fine. The accessibility to things is a real asset, and with the money saved, means you can do other things especially since we were only in the room to sleep and nothing more.As long as you don't go in with high expectations, it will suffice.

<Content>Overprice for a dump I'm glad I didn't have the reservation for this hotel. I made a reservation for my friend who decided he wanted to come to Winter music Conference in the last minute.I booked this hotel because I couldn't find any other hotel avaiable (winter music conference and sony erricson tournament at the same time in miami). I booked thru hotelclub.com, paid and got a receipt and a confirmation.I did read the bad reviews, but I was just going to have my friend use his room to sleep but hang out with me at the Conrad most of the time.We arrived at 6pm, we got lost because the hotel didn't stand out, and there are so many hotels along that road. And their sign was Ocean Breeze with a paper that's said Bay Breeze taped on the window.There were 2 people working behind the front desk, but apparently 1 guy couldn't even do anything. He just stood there. The other guy was helping the person in front of me. There were only 2 guests (together) in front of me and my friend, but it took the front desk guy 30 minute to help them. And then after that we saw the guests were leaving. I wasn't sure what happened because they were speaking spanish.I asked the guy that was just standing behind the desk doing nothing if he could help us, the other guy yelled at me very rude: Can you please wait?What's the point having 2 people behind the desk if only 1 person can help guests? So after 30 minute wait, it only took the guy 2 minutes to look through his reservation papers (there is an old computer but I think that's just for decoration) and told us that he couldn't find my reservation. I showed him the receipt and confirmation email from hotelclub. He didn't even look at the code, instead he wrote down a fax number and told us to call hotelclub and ask them to fax over a confirmation page. I WAS HOLDING THE CONFIRMATION PAGE!!! I was so mad, we left the hotel. We couldn't call hotelclub because their customer service closed at 5pm. So we couldn't take care of it until the next day.We left the hotel and called intercontinental hotel and luckily they still have rooms available (I would've booked intercontinental if their website didn't show fully booked). So my friend stayed there for 1 night and the rest of the weekend he stayed with me at Conrad.We called hotelclub the next day and the customer service was really helpful. She immediately processed the refund for my friend's credit card. She actually called Bay Breeze hotel to find out what happened and got yelled at by the front desk person that answered the phone. Bay Breeze hotel should be closed!One more thing, the lobby area smells horrible.

<Content>This is NOT a Hotel!!!! When my friend told me that she had booked this 'hotel' I checked it out on the website and was pleasantly surprised.However, upon arrival, I realised we'd been hoodwinked. We tried to make our way upstairs with our luggage (there were 4 girls staying for a week so you can imagine!) and got no help whatsoever. Trying to load our luggage into the lift was a nightmare as it seemed the lift had come from the 50's or whenever that building was erected and the door just kept shutting on you the moment you stepped foot inside!The room - this was not a spacious room, they had tried to squeeze 2 double beds in what was supposed to be a 1 double bedroom, one of the beds limited the access to the bathroom.The windows were broken so the air conditioning unit had to remain on and even that was tempermental.The bathroom was so skanky and vile, there was dirt coming from outside daily as the windows wouldn't shut. The dirt, I can only assume, was coming from the building being worked on only yards away.Every morning from the first day we got there, we were awoken by a woman screaming checkout and banging on our door even though every time I got up to yell back at her, her clip board clearly stated we had 5 more days before check out!Cleaning service was sporadic, again having to inform reception that it hadn't been done. There's so many other things I could mention but it really depresses me to even think about it.Oh and lastly, the swimming pool? Right next to the car park, because that clearly makes a lot of sense right?

<Content>Scamming with Deauville's overbookings Booked at the Deauville for 3 nights across the street via priceline, so I was prepaid. The Deauville was overbooked when I checked in after midnight - after waiting in line behind other irate customers for 25 minutes (the Deauville front desk staff is pathetic) I was told my only option was to stay across the street at the Bay Breeze. I walked over and if it wasn't 1:00 in the morning I would have left. As other posts have noted, this MOTEL is disgusting. The first thing I did when walking into the room was kill a bug that was crawling up the wall. I had to shut the water off to the toilet in the bathroom to keep it from running. This place has no redeeming qualities - it is a dump. I later learned that the Bay Breeze and Deauville have the same owner, so I think the scam is that they overbook the Deauville on purpose at higher rates and then send the poor saps who check in last over to the Bay Breeze. I stayed here for 5 hours and left - tired, angry and ripped off.

<Content>Nightmare on Collins We first drove by the so called hotel about 5 times before actually finding it..if they would've called it a MOTEL it would be a lot easier to find.Check in was quite ok, considering the receptionist who just woke up.He found my reservation in a box instead of computer..oh well appearantly that works too.Valet parking for 20 dollars a night..well i refused that and parked next to the parking for a whole week at the pizza hut personnels parking ( perfect )..Valet parking is nice but if they oly wouldve tried to create a system out of which they could easily trace a car back when guests asked for it...the entire day - and i mean the entire day you hear them honking the horns with the remote to trace back cars..unbelievable..Further they dont even charge 10 dollars per minut for long distance calls in the Hilton i believe - here they do..maybe because they have the old fashioned retro phones.On the info card in the room it says that the 0 is for calling the operator..well i guarantee you that you will never reach them through the 0..i had to call them through their ouside line...believe it or not..then they pick up..We were not the only guests in the room..found about twenty very little bugs or whatever...bathtub height is about 30 cm so good enough for your pets.Plesae please do not believe the pics on the net..it is a total hell !!

<Content>Not the best place to stay Booked this hotel as was one of cheapest in miami....Website said was across the road from the beach which is was...But i expected to see the beach not the case...Check in took 3hrs as we were not aware that we had to pay a $50 deposit, $20 a night carpark and $10 resort fee per night... The receptionist had an attitude problem... Fortunatley i spoke to the websitei booked threw and they managed to persuade the hotel that we didnt have to give a deposit nor have the credit card swiped (we just didnt trust the hotel) never had a deposit taken before....All we had to pay was the carparking...Went in to check in and agreed that we wud pay for the carpark...we isssued a travellers check which the receptionist said they cannot accept...What a nitemare!! In 15years of USA holidays i have never been refused the use of a travellers cheque. So off we went in the car to find somewhere to cash the cheque and get some change....Ended up in Publix and bought a few bits...Told the receptionist that we defo having room!!!Went back to the hotel....where we had lost our parking space....which resulted in us driving round and waiting for another hr to get parked...Finally got parked thanks to the valet parking guy from hotel across street....Went to check in and got told that we paid the carpark on departure!! So we had wasted over an hr going to cash in the cheque and lost our parking space for nothing....The hotel looked a dump....the room was ok....relitivley clean....air con was hanging off the wall as well as plug sockets....didnt leave anuything in the room wen we went out as it didnt seem safe and we just didnt tryust the hotel...our room was next to the fire escape which the door wudnt shut so anyone could get into the hotel.....I would not recommend this hotel....i certainley will never stay there again....

<Content>Digusting! This hotel was filthy, had sockets hanging out of the wall, bugs, moldy pizza in the cupboard and if you put your towel on the bath floor, it comes up black. Bedding was not washed, noisy and rude people at the front desk. Also put extra charges on my credit card for parking fees and an extra $150 deposit, per room. Did not stay overnight and was told that our credit card would be credited back. They did not, and we could not dispute it, as it was booked through hotels.com...even though I had a receipt that said they would credit it, seems they give everyone a receipt that says no charge as hotels.com booked you, versus them. I called the Miami Health dept to place a complaint at (305) 835-2200 and the Dept of Community Development at (305) 693 - 3120. I encourage others to do the same, as this hotel is not safe fire wise or health wise. It needs to be shut down.

<Content>BEWARE OF THIS PLACE! Don't expect to get what you've paid for. This hotel is not only severely overpriced, has poor service and dirty rooms, but its staff will try to steal from you as well. Expecting to get a decent room for $200 per day I booked this hotel for 2 nights and after the first night I couldn't bear to stay there any longer. I left and asked for the refund for the remaining time. I was told by the stuff that in order to receive the refund I'd need to call Orbitz. I did, but after Orbitz contacted the hotel its personnel said that I stayed the whole time and rejected to credit money back to my credit card.

<Content>Not the worst place I ever stayed I was a little concerned about the hotel after reading some reviews, but it really wasn't bad. The rooms were clean, new 27 tv's with cable, and the beds were actually comforable. The elevator was a little scary, and I didn't use the ice machine. The staff was nice, however, telling us about nearby restaurants and giving directions. You won't get fluffy towels, there is no room safe and no view, but my daughter  her friend insist is was 100 times better than a Days Inn they stayed in on the beach at South Beach. There is a small pizza place down the block open 24 hours that will deliver, and the beach is only a 2 minute walk.

<Content>this is not the worst hotel in Miami We booked two rooms during spring break to get together with our college age kids. My son and his girlfriend arrived first. One of the employees came up behind him and whispered  this is not the worst hotel in miami. It's not the worst, but we paid way too much for way too little. Rooms were dingy, dark and moldy. I was certain that someone was running teen prostitutes from the room across the hall. My son offered to stay with me in my room - so that I would feel safe. The three of us ended up watching tv. - at least they had decent cable.My best memory was of a cuban cafe up the street. They made the best cafe con leche.

<Content>OK First of all, this is the Ocean Breeze Motel, not hotel, at least according to the sign. Do not stay here. All you need is the basics - bed, bath, and a roof over your head.The room smelled moldy, the air conditioning is a wall unit, but at least it had a remote. The room was dark, even with the lights on. I tried not to open the windows because then everyone in the parking lot could see into the room.The only plus was the TV, which I think had pretty much every TV channel that a regular cable Tv subscriber would have.The bathroom was a terrible pale blue color, the cold water wasn't cold, and the toilet worked if you flushed twice. Small sink with no counter space.They were very particular about the checkout time of 11:00 am, at other hotels you can usually stay in the room for a little bit afterwards, but not here. My friend was coming at 2:00 pm that day, but I had to check out and wait in the lobby.Most of the staff spoke only spanish, with the exception of the clerk at the front desk. I was awakend at 10:30 on the day of my checkout by a lady who only could say checkout in english, despite having a do not disturb sign on the door. I wonder if the sign should be in spanish.The phone was missing some buttons, and the phone book was only L-Z.All this for a room that was $90 a night. Don't stay here, there are much better deals out there. Just keep looking around.

<Content>unauthorised charges!! Very concerned about unauthorised charges that go through on your credit card after you have checked out of the motel, that the manager or his staff cannot tell you what the charges are for and despite 4 phone calls from England to the States they still cannot tell me why I have been charged.Hotel booked and paid for on Expedia via internet but hte hotel insisted on photocoping my passport and credit card.

<Content>worst place I ever stayed at I booked this Hotel thru Orbitz thinking it would be halfway decent. It was the worst place I ever stayed at. It was listed as a two star but I wouldn't even give it a 1/2 star. The room was dungy and dirty looking and it smelled horrible. They photo copied my ID and credit card and at check out they would only give me the credit card copy back. I was not happy about that with all the identity theft going on. I would not recomend this hotel at all.

<Content>Was sad to see the cops pull up and tell him to turn down the music @ 5 am So myself, Robb Diggitty Dogg Shawn E Mac and Dj mamaluke roll up to the OCEAN BREEZE for The Winter Music Festival and to relax a bit from daily corporate hell life.WHAT A BEAUTIFUL hotel !!I loved the TOILET repair man who was in our room not once not twice but 3 TIMES to fix the toilet that in the end...was never really fixed !!2 times to the beautiful residents in the hotel such as the girl we called  CAPS  .... The 300 lb white women who had gold teeth and could talk more ghetto then any brother in Liberty City !!Loved the ALL NIGHT dj there as well..all 80's / spice girls / 90's commercial techno ...ALL NIGHT !! Would love to watch the tv and see what was going on in the world...but ------...it DIDNT work ( big surprise ) ...but who really comes to south beach to watch tv !?In the end Id say I would hit up the OCEAN BREEZE yet again...only if my ---- toilet worked!!! I love the conversations with the turkish toiler repair man and his quest to buy property in Turkey for little money, but I can only handle so much of that.Robert D Dogg

<Content>It was cool if U got a rent a car The Ocean Breeze Motel, is an inexpensive way to save while in Miami. I had a rent a car, so getting to South Beach wasn't a problem. South Beach is just a straight shot up one street and your there in fifteen to twenty min. Getting to downtown takes about the same amount of time. The staff was helpful, with directions on attractions. When I checked in I asked to be moved to a room with one King or Queen size bed, and they did it. It wasn't a problem at all.. The only negative is that you have to ask more than once for more than two sets of towels...But other than it that it was ok...fo A Two start

<Content>North Beach MOTEL, some problems Stayed here in Feb 05 (boat show weekend), after having booked and pre-paid through Expedia.Location is North Beach, near 65th street.Upon arrival, we were told our reservation was cancelled, even though Expedia had received and sent us a confirmation number from the hotel.As we arrived early, the staff was able to offer us the only single(!) room available, which kept us off the streets.The hotel is located a block away from a bus stop, with busses to Miami Beach, South Beach, and Miami Downtown.From the airport, it's a fixed USD 33 cab ride.The hotel is OK for a motel (though in our case expensive), but the troubles with the room were unacceptable.Recommend calling Ocean Breeze yourself in advance to confirm.

<Content>Stay away from it! This is one hotel to avoid. The pictures are deceiving. The room was smelly and dingy. The bathroom was dirty; especially the floor and the halls smelled of alcohol. There were just 2 towels, no remote control for the TV available and just soap, no shampoo. The hotel was poorly lit, and it wasn't renovated as advertised in the website. The neiborhood is nice but the hotel is depressingly dingly, dirty and old.

<Content>not worth it Dissapointing. Web Site made it look better than it was. Nothing major, but had no towels or washcloths or TV remote in room (had to ask from desk) and the pool was filthy==had trash floating in it! Great neighborhood, though, lots of good restaurants nearby and free parking.

<Content>What a deal! This is definitely the most affordable place to stay in Miami Beach. It cost me only a bit over 50 dollars with an AAA rate, and the parking is free (like manna from heaven in this neck of the woods). The room was clean, the pool was nice, and I even had a small patio space outside my room. You can zip to South Beach or Haulover in about 15 minutes by bus. Heck, there is even a direct bus route to the airport in Miami for those who want to save on cab fare. A wonderful find for the vagabonds among you. An added plus: it's in a delightful, walkable neighborhood with grocery stores, bakeries and great ethnic restaurants.

<Content>bit of a shock we visited Miami in Septer 2002. We just wanted some place to have a hot shower and sleep. The Super 8 was cheap and not too cheerful, for the price it was okay.The lobby was dingy the elevator was creaky and by the time we got to the door of the room I was thinking what have we done.When we opened the door the room was a pleasant surprise, very clean the bed was comfy and fairly new. All in all not too bad for the money.The young chap on the desk was very pleasant and couldn't have been more helpful. Don't think I would stay there again though.Am off to Miami again in about a month and am looking for someplace nicer this time. So if anyone can reccommend someplace nice for 3 adults for 3 nights please feel free to get in touch
