<Content>Lovely gem of a hotel for a family winter break We visited Berlin for the purpose of sampling Germany's Christmas markets in Dec 2008. We have a 3yr and a then-3month old so any mini-break choice would have to be carefully thought out. The Hotel de Rome impressed us by its friendliness and enthusiasm about hosting our young children. We booked directly with the hotel's staff, who excitedly told us about their children's program.The location of the hotel in Mitte (old East Berlin, now the museum hub of the city) was fantastic; it was within a 5 minute walk of two of the best christmas markets, including a charming one in beautiful Gendarmenmarkt. Near the hotel was one of Berlin's upscale shopping avenues, for those needing a break from the museums. The Brandenburg Tor and several other famous Berlin sites were only 20-30 minutes by foot, in all a great location.The hotel lobby impressed us with its luxe feel. It was more quiet sophistication than business hotel atmostphere. The high ceilings of the old bank building site were breathtaking and the parlour for tea/breakfast was lovely. Staff were so friendly and went out of their way to fuss over the kids.The kids club is new so will need tweaking, and is targeted towards older kids. THey had special classes, including cookie baking, which a 5-10 year old bracket would enjoy. The staff dropped off cookies with our children's names spelled out and candies on individual plates. My husband and I enjoyed sampling them, in lieu of our 3month old.The room had an enormous bed and even with a crib for our toddler, it was spacious for the four of us. Top notch finishings in the room too, again more quiet luxury.In all, this was a lovely, sophisticated hotel that would appeal to couples, business travelers and yes, even young families on a short weekend break looking for an elegant, enjoyable place to relax.

<Content>stay in a bank This is a very agreable hotel in a perfect position if visiting the main museums of Berlin is your intention. The rooms are huge and very well appointed, but the public spaces are too empty and barren to be welcoming.This is very much a business hotel - I can't image it as a suitable one for family visits.

<Content>Simple luxury I was impressed with Hotel de Rome from the moment I spotted it down the street. Set in a beautiful square in a very impressive and grand palladian building which used to be a bank it makes an immediate impact. The public areas are impeccably appointed in grey, brown and black colors with classic contemporary art-deco influenced furnishings that really do the large scale halls justice. My classic room was huge, beautifully decorated in red and black, and very comfortable. The bathrooms, evoking Rome with their mosaics and marble walls, were perfectly equipped. The pool was magnificent, if a bit cold. Breakfast was absolutely worth the price: I was particularly impressed with the array of smoked meats, cheese and breads, and the delicious exquisite jams. The service was top-notch in all aspects. The concierge's many advice on restaurants and shops were priceless. The maids meticulously displayed my personal beauty products and utensils on a clean towel beside the wash bin. The sympathy and attention to detail was constant throughout. The downside was the lack of jacuzzi in the spa, and the charged internet (20 Euros per day).

<Content>Worth visiting Berlin for Among the best hotels I have stayed in. The rooms are spacious, well designed, and although modern, a pleasure to be in. A fantastic health club, and brilliant staff.It is expensive, but I didn't regret a cent

<Content>5 star with a few issues I stayed at The Hotel de Rome on business. I normally stay at the Hilton which is a good 4 star hotel by US standards. The Hotel de Rome is a full notch higher. It is a 5 star hotel by US standards. The service is top notch. You are walked to your room and shown and amenities. You are also shown around when you visit the spa. I interacted with several employees, one was a snob, the others friendly and respectful.My room was fairly large with a contemporary design, new furnishings and very clean. The room was very quiet (not surprising being an inner room). There were three issues I had with the room: 1. There is no iron. It costs 6.5 Euros to have a shirt pressed. If you come is late at night with an early morning meeting, this could be a problem. I always think it is a bit of a scam not to provide guests with an iron, in addition to being a pain. 2. There is no alarm clock so you have no idea what time it is during the night (the clock on the TV goes off when turned off) and you have to use wake up service. The front desk attendant seemed very surprised when I suggested it would be nice to include an alarm clock in the room. 3. The hotel was formerly a bank and the bank design, particularly the large halls, gives it a certain grandeur. There is a problem with this however, when you stay in an inner room. There are a couple of atriums which gives the inner rooms light. The rooms are at two ends with large hallways on each side (perpendicular to the rooms). The hallways have windows which allow a line of sight into your room. Thus, you will have to decide whether you want light or privacy. Not a choice you should have to make in a 5 star hotel. I would not stay there again if I had to have an inner room.The spa also has a modern design. The gym is furnished with high end equipment including treadmills, cycles and stair climbers. There are only three types of weight machines (chest press, leg press and shoulder press) which only perform one type of exercise so a full weights workout on machines is not possible. There are dumbbells but no other free weights. The room is very small but it was empty when I was there. The indoor pool area is also very small with one 20m lane to swim. I do not think there is any food/drink service in the pool area. The water was pretty chilly. The steam room is small and okay, the sauna nicer. The gym is provided with robes and slippers.The food was very good (surprisingly well prepared), albeit pricey, and arrived quickly when I ordered room service.

<Content>Five star service My friend and I stayed for 2 nights and the staff couldn麓t have been more helpful. They mistakenly gave me a smoking room which was quickly resolved for a non-smoking room. The rooms and bathrooms were lovely and the room cleaning and turn-down service thorough. The concierge was very helpful in finding us a lake nearby where we could spend the afternoon as well as advising on nearby attractions and services. The doormen were also friendly. The breakfast was superb with wonderful homemade breads and pastries as well as all the usual five star trimmings one would expect. We wanted to dine there too, but it was a bit too quiet (being late July) for our social appetites so we went elsewhere, but it looked promising. The spa was good although you are unlikely to get 2 people doing laps at the same time and the freshly squeezed orange juice they offer on paper is not freshly squeezed in reality. I had a great pedicure. Overall this hotel was wonderful and worth the stay.

<Content>Expensive but great! An excellent hotel - quietly located in the Mitte district (within what used to be East Berlin), opposite a quiet square and Humboldt Univ. About 10 minutes walk from Brandenburg Gate, about 10 minutes walk from Museum Island, about 15 minutes by taxi to Kunst Forum where the superb and newly built Gemaldegalerie and Neue National Galerie have excellent art collections.About 20 minutes from Tegel airport by taxi at 6pm in the evening (cost E20 which we thought very reasonable) and about 40 minutes from Schonefeld airport (cost us E40 to get there for our return flight).Much larger hotel than the other Rocco Forte hotel we have visited (Savoy in Florence). Also has outside space (4th floor terrace and bar) which was much appreciated as weather was in the high 80s (in May!!)Extremely stylishly decorated, pleasant bar with live music in the evenings, extensive (but expensive) breakfast buffet. We had lunch there too in the Parioli restaurant (Italian) - very good.In room internet is expensive E20 per 24 hours. Wifi downstairs free of charge but did not try this (if you are on business, you will be in your room!).We had deluxe rooms - extremely large and airy. Not sure I would pay the extra as we heard standard rooms are pretty good too, and we did not spend long in the rooms. Bathroom was perfect - up to date, absolutely clean, and separate shower and bath. We paid E400 per night including breakfast so we had high expectations.Did not visit the Spa.Staff a mix of other Europeans and Germans - without exception they were friendly and pleasant.In the vicinity, there is the Michelin starred Vau restaurant (rather expensive but with a pleasant courtyard for warm evening dining) about 5 minutes walk. Other restaurants a short walk away - mixed quality. Concierge gives good advice.Not perhaps the most exciting place for younger people to stay (no local buzz) but extremely comfortable for middle aged folk. Those of us who like swirly carpets and traditional decor might be better off at the Adlon but we would certainly return if in Berlin again.

<Content>Superb Stayed here on business for 1 night only but wished it could have been longer. Arrived at 4am ! and was warmly welcomed including hot coffee and warm pastries waiting in my room...now that is service.I have stayed at a number of the Forte collection hotels and this one has stunning public areas, very smart indeed. Room was quiet and simply furnished but still luxurious.Sadly didn't have a chance to try the restaurants or bar this visit but the staff i did meet were helpful and friendly.Perfect location for a weekend break, will make sure I return for a longer stay.

<Content>a very very good hotel - right in the center, BEST location we - family of 2 adults and 2 kids - stayed past christmas in the Hotel; it was fantastic; folks are very very freindly who work there; the rooms are very nice and the material used for deco is high standard. we liked the spa, albeit the water is not too depp, but you swim in the old Tresor of the Dresdner Bank! what an experience. we had a technical problem, the rooms where overheated, and it was not really possible to turn off the AC/Heating, but the next day we got that sorted. i give it a 5-star, as this was immediately sorted.i like the breakfast area, you are for once not forced to go to the buffet but can have a coffee and a croisant and enjoy the morning. we paid a very competitive rate of 250 Euro per room.we walked by the Adlon Hotel, which compared to De Rome, is overly glitzy and had a huge construction site infront; LOCATION - this is really the best, withing a few hundred meter walk to the museums and to the opera. while there are many hotels that arrived in the last 10 years but do not really distinguish themself from one anotehr, her is finally a new place that shows character.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel but Overpriced Services We travel to Berlin annually to visit family and usually stay at our relatives' houses. However, we decided to get some private time and are so glad we chose this hotel. It is located in a great location. The decor is done flavorfully well and extremely modern. Bed is absolutely comfortable. Our bedroom window looked out into the interior courtyard though and people walking down the corridor could see into our bedroom if we didn't have the shades down. Bathroom is extremely spacious and clean. Bar downstairs is great for visitors. Internet is charged which is ridiculous. I had a basic mani/pedi and it cost $225.00. Too much. Otherwise, it is a great hotel.

<Content>Practically Perfect I stayed here with my wife and 13 year old son for four nights in January. It was my first experience of a Rocco Forte hotel and I can't wait for the next, it may even be Hotel de Rome again. We were upgraded to a junior suite on arrival and it just kept getting better and better. The beds are great. The breakfast is exceptional with a huge array of fruits , fantastic bread, bircher muesli, meats, cheeses, juices, smoked salmon, great coffee and a huge selection of teas. The spa is really great and when we were there it was practically empty. But best of all is the concierge service which is the most helpful I have ever come across. Get them to make restaurant bookings for you and I heartily recommend San Nicci on Friedrichstrasse and Nola's am Weinberg in the park on Veteranerstrasse for the best authentic brunch among the beautiful people of Berlin. Also go on a walking tour with New Berlin Walking tours. They start in Pariserplatz outside Starbucks and are a fantastic, moving and funny introduction to this great city

<Content>5 stars for service and comfort! stayed here with my husband for 3 nights on a recommendation from a friend who does a lot of business travel in Berlin. This was a genuine 5 star experience with one of the best concierge services I've experienced. Charming young Welsh concierge spent at least 20 minutes advising us on getting around and making recommendations for restaurants. Decor is modern, minimalist but very dramatic and attractive. We were upgraded to a superior (De Luxe) room overlooking the square, which was very quiet. Both room and bathroom sizes were huge, very comfortable bed and top class bathroom fittings including double walk-in shower. Didn't eat in the hotel restaurant, but did stop a while at the very trendy bar with pianist and singer where the beautiful people seemed to congregate. Overall a lovely, city hotel with discreet and very knowledgeable staff, but not at all pompous or stuffy. Would highly recommend the Hotel de Rome and would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Almost the best ! Just came back from a long week end in Berlin. I choose Hotel de Rome as i wanted a mix of contemporain and historical Berlin. Perfect , this is the place! Hotel de Rome gets really a trendy chic place. Select a junior suite 230 if you want absolute quiet, space in room, lots of light and feel like in a room of one of Cesar's palaces. Room service excellent on ponctuality, good food small quantities. Housekeeping excellent on request. Small pool but agreable. Excellent massage specialist, ask for the tunisian masseur ( sorry i don't remember his name ). Concierge very helpful. i wasn't in the restaurant but ordered very good plates from it. One negative thing, i asked prior arrival for a DVD player in my room: no one told me about it or about the impossibility to get it! I would have expect a answer to my request. All over, one of the top 3 worldwide hotels of my private list.

<Content>absolutely fantastic we loved this hotel and thought it was perfect. it is in a great location in the old east berlin amongst some of the most beautiful buildings and it is easy to get elsewhere.the hotel is luxurious without being pretentious and the service is second to none. each and every one of the staff went out of their way to help us and welcome uswe had a room on the second floor and it was fabulous. it was a standard room but immacualte. the bed was comfy and the bathroom gorgeous plus a huge walk in wardrobethe spa was a bonus and very quiet in the eveningthe food in the restaurant was stunning. my only gripe would be that the resturant doesn;t have much atmosphere and the lighting is dreadfuloverall - wonderful

<Content>trendy designer hotel Recently spent 2 nights at Hotel de Rome,Berlin with my husband who was on a business trip. It had only been open 6 weeks and so there were some minor teething troubles such as the TV internet facilities not working. Bedroom very comfortable but the duvet was heavy and it was too hot to sleep - there were no alternative bed coverings available. Also the pillows whilst being of the highest quality were too thick for my liking. The aircon was difficult to work out as there were no temperature markings and it was not possible to open the window only a little.The bathroom was very luxurious but the towels did not smell that fresh. The decor of the hotel is minimalist and beautifully colour coordinated. We had dinner in the dining room with guests and although the 'italian' food was of a very high standard, we were surprised to be charge over 80 euros for 7 bottles of mineral water! Breakfast is charged extra and you can help yourself from the buffet for 19 euros or have cooked stuff as well for 26 euros. Fantastic buffet of best quality cheese, meat, salmon, breads, cakes, fresh berries, cereals, juices etc. We did not use the spa but the water in the pool was warm.Good location in beautiful building with helpful staff.

<Content>Rocco Forte Hotels, march on! This 5 star hotels opening day was the 12th October 2006.The day we arrived in Berlin for the first time.I had paid a cancellation fee on my existing hotel reservation and accepted an opening offer rate,with extras included.New hotel so taxi drivers dont know it.New door man but he takes care of the bags.New reception staff,well I say new but it seems staff were brought from all over the chains empire,even England.Mid afternoon,opening day,but room not yet ready.First drink on the house came with last bar snax I ever saw.Due to very poor communications from central reservations (Germany) I had already complained and was told at the hotel that they had a nice room to show me.Room 402 is extra pleasant,if small, (there are about six room grades).Roof top views,private sun deck,three windows (including two patio doors).The hotel is on the famous square of the Nazi book burning,surrounded by fabulous buildings,but is itself dour and somber.If it were not for flags you could miss it.The mini bar was filled after we entered the room,and a security gaurd spent each day near our door.There was no in room information,no room service advice,no building history,no mention of breakfast was ever made except at reservation,when 26 euros each was quoted.The bathroom (as with the complete hotel)was lavish.Large bath,seperate shower,the heated floor often too hot or off.Volume control from TV,magnifying mirror,but alas hum drum toiletries.The bedroom too appeared fabulous,curtain and decor wise,but we found the mattress too firm,the air con difficult,the chairs uncomfortable.The generous fruit plates were due to my earlier complaint I think.The next day the room was not made up by our return at 3,30pm,we retreated to the sombre bar for cocktails on the house.The basement swimming pool in the old bank vault basement looked good,but as a T shape is not built for passing,and the water was cold.We were shown the sauna and steam as we left.There was no recepticle for used towels but plenty lockers and a large gym.The following day the room was not made up again, this time by 4.30pm,despite the lit up door indicator being set.We were given a bottle of Champagne that evening.We did not use the restaurant,but had expensive bar drinks,no snax provided.It felt like half of Berlin had wandered arround the hotel by this time,just to check it out.Despite pointing out to reception that my reservation offered,room upgrade if available,welcome drinks with canapes,plus a welcome gift, we recieved none of them,so on departure ,when presented with a higher rate than booked,I opted for a lower room rate than the one I had reserved after a difficult negotiation.At no time were we clear if a hotel manager existed.The concierge service was excellent.
