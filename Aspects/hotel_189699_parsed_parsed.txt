<Content>superb superb hotel. Our room was a deluxe and was particularly large and so nice with its typical parisian decoration and furniture. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom very convenient. The English Bar is very nice for a drink before dinner. Breakfast was amazingly good.The fitness room is very well provided and has a (very) small hammam and a small sauna. It is just 2 minutes walking from the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs ElysèŒ…es. The staff was very nice.

<Content>Over the Top Raphael Just returned from a magical week in Paris with my two adult daughters and cannot say enough nice things about the staff at the Hotel Raphael. The concierge group was ever-ready to arrange, to assist, to interpret, to inquire on our behalf - even to order a pizza when we collapsed one night after a long day of walking. We wake up every morning at our respective homes wishing that the Raphael staff was there to prepare the delicious breakfast in such a lovely setting. The Hotel style is Old World - filled with beautiful artwork, lovely flowers on each floor, tres, tres elegante. Yes, the elevator is tiny, but it is the most charming elevator you will ever see. Our rooms were spacious and had a wonderful narrow balcony where we could step out to check the temperature or just watch the world go by. It's not on a busy street, so the noise was just ambient city noise. The bathrooms are deluxe - fantastic showers and the housekeeping staff was incredibly diligent - everything was beautifully cleaned and the ironed sheets were heavenly. The location of the hotel just steps away from the Metro station makes this a great location for exploring the city. There is no dinner service except for the summer season - not a drawback for us, but some might be concerned. You can always get room service or order in. Do NOT miss the view from the terrace atop the Raphael. Although the restaurant was closed, we went up with a glass of champagne on our last night and saw the most spectacular view of the light show at the Eiffel Tower (maybe at 11 p.m?) It was the perfect end to a most wonderful week.

<Content>Good, not great The hotel's location is really good, room was nice and large (in Parisian standards) and a welcome basket of fruits were waiting. Still it lacked something in the atmosphere. One night concierge gave a good (local) restaurant recommendation but totally wrong walking instructions!Next time I will try one of the Grand hotels (George V, Le Meurice etc.)

<Content>Very posh! Me and my girlfriend decided to stay here on our train journey to marrakech. we stayed one night in paris, and chose this hotel because it appears in the daarjelling limited, and because it looked VERY nice.the hotel is beautiful, with antique furniture, and paintings. the staff did seem a little perplexed at us, in our shorts and rucksacks, but i 'spose they don't see too many people like that staying there.we had the cheapest room, which was nice, but you could tell it was the cheapest room in a very expensive hotel. also the roof terrace was closed for 2 days while we were there, which was annoying, as this was a real plus point of this hotel for me. everyone spoke good english, which was also very helpful.

<Content>Amazing Hotel! This hotel was absolutely gorgeous! The lobby is kind of small and stuffy, but the gracious staff more than made up for it. There is an amazing cafe on the roof with incredible views of the city. The decor was spectacular, with beautiful antique furniture. The bathrooms were also very nice, very large and comfortable. We had a two room suite with two full baths, and it also had a very nice vanity with a huge mirror and great lighting for doing makeup. The location was great, literally right in the heart of a lot of luxury shopping. The area was very safe, also. My sister and I walked a couple blocks around the hotel well past midnight and still felt completely secure. All in all, staying at this hotel was an amazing experience and I would love to do it again.

<Content>Big Rooms, Great Location This elegant, classy hotel is conveniently located a block away from the Arc de Triomphe and just steps away from a metro stop. This gives you great access to the main stops in Paris.The breakfast buffet was very complete and of high quality. the bread basket alone would have been enough, but you also have a choice of cold cuts, cheeses, fruits, yogurts and enev scrambled eggs and sausage. Service in general was great; the staff made an effort to speak English or Spanish if your French isn't up to the task. The concierge was very helpful in making recommendations and helping with reservations at restaurants, be it a fancy restaurant or a small bistro in the Latin Quarter.One surprise was the sheer size of the rooms; big for anywhere, huge for Paris. The bright bathroom was also very spacious, allowing for two persons to get ready at the same time without having to fight for space. The only complaint is that the pillows weren't very comfortable (European properties are lagging in bedding in general).The price tag is up there but you certainly get the service and amenities you would expect from a hotel of this caliber.

<Content>An exceptional beautiful hotel The Hotel Raphael is a truly beautiful hotel,operated with charmand efficiency and with the best concierge team of any I have encountered in Paris de luxe hotels.This hotel manages to be luxurious but homely at the same time.The restaurant is excellent,the bar small but lively and popular and the whole ambience is enjoyable and thankfully completely devoid of the snobbery and self congratulatory manner of other top Paris hotels.I understand this hotel is privately owned and it shows.The attention to detail,the personal service and the feeling of being an individual and not part of a production line.Although the hotel is located on a main Avenue,Kleber,the hotel is set back and is quiet.The rooms are superbly furnished and the junior suite that we had was magnificent..the word junior being amusing as these suites are larger than many others I have stayed in.All in all,a great hotel.Sometimes I wonder at the feedbacks that hotels get on these websites and generally I see those for the Raphael are good.It is hard to see how anyone could be negative about the Raphael..everythings a matter of opinion but there is nothing ambiguous to say about this hotel.It is,quite simply,one of the top 3 in Paris.

<Content>Beautiful hotel- great service We just returned from a three night stay at the Hotel Raphael. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfortable. We arrived early in the morning (8:00a.m.) and tried to check in but there were no rooms available. We had reserved a Junior suite with an alcove. The front desk suggested that we go out for breakfast and and come back about 1:00 p.m. but at 10:30 they called our cell phone and told us that our room was ready. Much to our surprise, they upgraded us to a larger, beautiful suite. The hotel is in a perfect location. It seemed that it would cost about 10 euros to go anywhere in a taxi. The concierge is very helpful. Every suggestion they made for dinner was excellent. I agree with the previous reviewer about the drinks. We walked out of the bar because of the cost of the drinks. Nineteen euros for a vodka tonic!!!!! We could not justify paying that.I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>So convenient Found the Raphael staff to be charming and very polite and helpful.The hotel is well located being vertually on top of the Arc de triumph.The rooms were lovely, well sized pretty decoration and the bathroom was fabulous.It was a resplendant hotel at every level.The only negative comment relates to the price of drinks at the bar, as these were very expensive.Overall we had a great stay, were able to wander around Paris with ease from this location.

<Content>Excellent location and wonderful bed Definitely in the leading hotels of the world category. Didn't get to partake of all on offer, but was pleased to be close to the Arche De Triomphe and Champs Ellysees. Wish I had more time for the breakfast (looked good), but the wonderful bed sucked me under and I had a good nights sleep. Perfect location for a business trip and different than my experiences out in the no mans land of La Defence.

<Content>Breakfast disaster Compared with the other palace hotels in Paris, the most traditional is the Raphael (even more so than the Bristol): original interior, old-fashioned service, not at all corporate or hip, like a luxurious private mansion.The room (junior suite) was very large by any standard with a luxurious bathroom (well renovated). For 600éˆ§?per night, the room was a little worn, though, and some upgrading is necessary: more comfortable furniture, flat screen TV, hifi, etc.The reason I am rating the hotel three stars is the breakfast: 36éˆ§?for a low-quality and very limited buffet! The Raphaæ¯›l has a very good chef for lunch and dinner, and they should put him in charge of the first meal of the day. For this reason, I will not return.

<Content>Solid choice in Paris it was very passable, nothing too over the top, about what I expected in this price range. Staff was fine, bathroom amenties of good quality, linens of good quality, just nothing extra for 350 euros/ night. Breakfast is not included and is 30 euros and looked okay but for that kind of money I would step outside the hotel and find another spot for a coffee and pastry for around 4-5 euros. Very business oriented type clientile. Why no 5 star review? The TV's suck. At this price I expect a flat screen and free interenet. Good ocation right by the Arc. Walking distance to Champs and Eiffel.

<Content>Enjoyed Hotel Raphael Stayed at the hotel Raphael for three nights in March 2006 with my girlfriend. We were two females travelign alone and th lcaotion can't be beat. the hotel is within walking distance to the Eifel Towe, Arc de Triomphe, and Champs de Elysees. We ordered room service and found the choices to be somewhat limiting, but the hotel rooms were very nice. We had a one bedrooom suite and found the separate area to be very good for two women who sometimes want their own space. The cocierge was also very helpful and courteous. For the price would probably try another hotel next time, but did enjoy this hotel. We ate at the hotel one night for dinner and found the food to be excellent. The only complaint I have about the hotel is that the gym facilities are very small and didn't provide enough equipment for a full workout. But due to the excellent locaiton I made it up by walking everywhere. Have fun!

<Content>Wonderful hotel We spent 5 nights at the Hotel Raphael at the end of October. I can't understand the negative reviews of this hotel. All the staff was very friendly and spoke reasonable English. We had a beautiful deluxe room on the 4th floor with a huge balcony and a view of the Arc de Triomphe to the left and the Eiffel Tower to the right. The hotel has the look of a private club, and the bar is heavily used by businessmen. We had one dinner in the restaurant and it was excellent. The buffet breakfast was included in our rate and was quite good. It is very expensive at 35 euros if you are paying for it. The location can't be beat, especially with a subway stop almost in front of the hotel. We can't imagine staying any place else when in Paris.

<Content>Nice place, but don't ask the concierge for advice The Raphael is nice boutique hotel with quite a bit of character. My wife and stayed there for Bastille Day and actually enjoyed it. First of all, they upgraded us to a two room suite with both rooms the size of a normal Four Seasons Hotel. The hotel is older, but is clean and has the modern amenities. Our bedroom had french doors seperating it from the sitting area. The bed was very comfortable which is more than I can say for the other furniture in the room. The couch was ornate, but was small and hard as a rock.  The shower was tiny, but did have the mutliple jets (one of the self-contained units). If you are overweight, I am not sure you could even use it. The bathtub was very beautiful (antique free-standing with brass feet). Its a bit of a hike from the Louvre and about the same distance from l'Orsay, but is very close to Champps Elyesee. It is very quiet which we enjoyed (even on Bastille Day). Its fairly close the Tower.So the part I did not like was their concierge. Nice enough people, but terrible in recommendations. They recommended a couple of Jazz clubs for us to check out. We visited the first one, its was the size of a small basement and full of smoke (most clubs in Paris are), but the problem was that everyone there was in their early 70's or late 60's. Which would be ok, if we weren't in our early 30s. The second recommendation (which we stopped by only out of shear curiousity) was supposedly the happening place where we could use his card to get in. I am glad we had it as there wsa not a doorman or anyone else there for that matter. I think there were about 10 people in the entire bar and there was not a band. Needless to say we ended up going the bar at the Plaza Athenee, which is definitely a place to see and be seen (several celebs there when we went). Its worth seeing and the staff was actually fairly friendly. I could give another paragraph on their restaurant recommendations, which were actually worse than the clubs. They will encourage you to eat in the roof top restaurant and its actually not bad. It does have a nice view and is the like dinning in a garden in the middle of the city. The tables are seperated by hedges  assorted plants. A bit pricey, but compared to other places its not outrageous. All in all, its nice hotel. There are definitely better the Four Seasons was truly amazing (go there for high tea), the Plaza Athenee  the Crillion, but then again you are not spending $1000 a night either. For what you spend, its a nice hotel with large rooms that have character.

<Content>Disappointed by the Raphael We had high hopes for the Raphael as it looked beautiful on the website and the staff we spoke to prior to the reservation were very helpful. When we arrived, we were shown to a suite that was very dark, with wrinkled, old carpet and sagging beds. The furniture was uncomfortable and too dainty to actually sit upon. The small and ancient television in the salon was placed on a side table that looked like it was taken from someone's basement. The only redeeming feature was the large and beautiful bathroom - very French, and completely renovated but we could not bear the thought of staying in the room for 4 nights. We requested another suite which was brighter and had a nice bathroom but the the salon and bedroom were still a little shabby; the doors to the cupboards stuck, the light switches had a mind of their own and on the last night, a fuse blew when we turned on a light in the sitting room. The art in the rooms and public areas was impressive but did not make up for the dated and shabby decor in general. While some people may view the decor as charming, I do not feel that this hotel is first class or luxurious - perhaps it was 30 years ago. It was very expensive and neither rooms nor the service merited the price.We did visit the Roof Restaurant and the view and the atmosphere were magical. Unfortunately, the food was poor and not what we expected for the price - two main courses had to be returned and one was essentially inedible even after the 2nd try yet we recieved no apology and were charged full price for all of the meals. We left a message for the concierge and/or manager but did not receive a telephone call from either. However, regardless of the mediocre/poor food, the Roof was worth the visit because of the view. We would have liked to have visited the Roof bar but on 2 of the 4 nights we were there, the entire Roof area was closed for a private party. We will not return to this Hotel.

<Content>Not Impressed I was very disappointed in the quality of the room they gave us. Not only was there water stains in several locations of the carpeting, the a/c unit leaked profusely thru the room, the television had to be replaced, and the complimentary fruit they left in our room had rotten items. The decor was old and not just in the historic sense, and my companion and I both experienced extreme itching on our legs both days at this hotel. We had to either assume we were both allergic to their detergent or possible bed bugs. We never had this issue at any other hotel prior nor any after. We stopped into the bar after dinner and although there were at least 6 others sitting, there was not a bar tender present until someone finally complained to the concierge upon which the hotel manager stepped in. My next experience was while I was frantically trying to use the internet to change my flights after the London bombings. There was a lady using the internet for hours to check her email. After discussing how much longer she would be, I found she wasn't even a guest at the hotel! She walked in off the street and needed to use a computer.On a postive note, the concierge went above and beyond to help in any way possible during our trip.

<Content>The Raphael: Our Favorite Hotel Ever! We were there May 24-30, 2005. Every staff member speaks fluent English and none could have provided more impeccable service. They treated us not only with respect, but like welcome family members. I arranged the trip through an auction on LuxuryLink and the value was unbelievable; I recommend it without reservation. We received a huge, lovely bouquet of flowers and a sumptuous basket of fruit when we arrived. Our suite (the Duplex - you can see it on their website) was impeccably decorated in Louis XV style and included a spiral staircase to a study area and a balcony from which we could see the Arc de Triomphe, Sacre Coeur, Champs Elysee and (standing on a chair), the Eiffel Tower, all while surrounded by jasmine, roses and more in the little garden area. Sunrise and sunset were both staggering. The breakfast could be taken in a lovely dining room from a buffet or in our own room - either way, there was a wide variety of delicious breakfast food and tons of coffee with hot milk in silver pitchers. Dinner was equally delicious and also very graciously served. The metro station Kleber and a taxi stand were literally right outside the door. The bathroom was luxurious - my favorite soaps, plus huge, thick towels and terry robes and slippers in a bathroom that felt like an Italian tile work of art; a fabulous multi-headed shower plus a huge tub, bidet, toilet and generous sink, too. The furniture and bed were covered in fine silk and the furnishings were exquisite. Reservations were made seamlessly and all manner of confusions were straighted out by the concierge staff. We felt like royalty!! Perfect place for a romance of the century!!

<Content>The place to stay for a perfect Paris visit... If you're looking for a gorgeous hotel with superb service in an elegant but convenient area, look no further than the Raphael. It's everything you'd hoped for and more. The rooms are lovely and the staff is friendly and efficient. The breakfast buffet is divine! Yes, it's expensive, but the Hotel Raphael delivers.

<Content>An Experience Not To Be Missed! We've traveled extensively, through Europe (even lived there) and around the world, and Hotel Rafael is one of the only hotels we have frequented numerous times because it exemplifies the definition of class and timeless style. The hotel is pure elegance without a hint of being ostentatious; the staff bend over backwards to be helpful even with our French which is severely lacking they manage to communicate efficiently; and the breakfasts are the best we've ever eaten with fresh juices, cafe and breads beyond compare (so much so that when they were overbooked, we went there to indulge in breakfast). This is a hotel that delivers an experience you will relish forever......just writing about it makes me want to visit!

<Content>An elegant address We just returned from a six day trip to Paris and stayed at the hotel Raphael. Overall we were very pleased with the staff (they didn't break out laughing at my attempt at French), quality of the rooms and location. We booked two rooms- there were 5 of us. We had a standard and a deluxe room. Both rooms were very elegant with the deluxe room being slightly larger and the bathroom had a separate shower (amazing water pressure). There was plenty of closet space, the air conditioning worked well, beds comfortable and efficient maid service. There were only a few things to criticize like smoke - its everywhere in Paris and the lobby and bar are no exception- just exhale as you exit the lift and make a dash for the entrance and you'll be OK. Also pillows- what's with the foam pillows - I prefer feather pillows so to me foam pillows are like sleeping with your head on a brick. All in all we really enjoyed are stay at the Raphael.

<Content>Experience the bourgeois days of Paris We traveled to Europe for the first time and decide to stay in the city of Paris.  We are discerning travelers, very very very choosy in our accomandations. Hotel Raphael was our choice and we are telling you that this place was initimate and romantic and right out of the 18th century! We had a junior suite so we do not know what the other rooms look like but the room we had was beautifully furnished, decorated and it was in immaculate condition. Our room was constantly cleaned, towels replaced, there was always fresh fruit and flowers.  It is VERY expensive at this hotel, if you are looking to watch your pennies do not stay here, you will be highly upset! The roof top restaurant was SO BEAUTIFUL! You can see the eiffel tower to the right and the Arc de Triomphe on the left! Champs ElysèŒ…es is less then 5 minute walk and the metro entrance is 100ft from the entrance!  This is a beautiful initimate hotel regardless what the other reviewers stated.

<Content>Most awful hotel we ever stayed at My husband and I stayed at the Raphael in May 04. The rooms were not that great for the amount we payed, and the staff was not friendly. We also got really bad food poisoning from their room service and we both were extremely sick. I will not recommend this hotel to anyone!!!!!!

<Content>Superb Location. Wonderful Staff. Hotel Raphael is ideally located in one of Paris' upscale neighborhoods. When you step out onto the sidewalk, you have an upclose view of the Arc de Triomphe since it is only about 200' away on your right. The famous Champs-Elysees is three streets behind the Hotel. One street behind the Hotel you have a clear view of the Eiffel Tower on one side of you and the Arc on the other. The Hotel Raphael was a Palace in the 18th century and still maintains it's palatial presentation inside. Although very expensive (we had the cheapest room at $320 Euros/night) the Louis XIV decorated rooms are spacious with updated/modern bathrooms - including a heated towel rack and a full shower. The staff was exceptional. Metro riders will rejoice in knowing that the Kleber metro entrance is only 50' from the front entrance of the Hotel and Avenue Kleber is dotted with a few family ran Cafe's and Brasserie's, but know some French because most did not speak English. We would have given 5 stars, but our room was located on the side of the hotel where the daily 4 a.m. trash pickup awoke us, and once neighbors moved in above us, the floor would squeak when they walked across it and their every move or conversation could be heard. Also, the rooftop Jardin Plein Ceil was closed when we were there in late-March 2004.

<Content>Treat yourself to La Vie en Rose We have just returned from 6 nights at this wonderful hotel. It is a truly wonderful find. Our suite was right out of a movie about a grand Paris Hotel--extraordinary antiques and boisserie, incredible architectural details, swag draperies and mahogany, endless closet and drawer space, a brand new and beautiful big marble bathroom with seperate shower and tub. The service is truly wonderful and the staff could not have been nicer. The concierge made every lunch and dinner reservation we requested and even got us the hardest table to find in Paris. The Salle A Manger is clearly a power breakfast spot loaded with high power types enjoying the buffet breakfast at 27 Euros!!!! (Ours was included in our rate). We had dinner one evening there -- also included in our price and it was classic French and very well done and presented. The location is also excellent--in an extremely posh residential district so its very quiet yet just steps from the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysee. The Raphael is consistently listed as one of the top ten hotels in Paris and from the moment we arrived until our bittersweet departure we could easily see why.Vive Le Raphael!

<Content>A Beautiful Gem! This is a truely beautiful hotel with fabulous antique furniture in the lobby and rooms. We admired the Turner on the wall as we checked in. The staff was outstanding in every regard. We had booked a deluxe room and were delighted to find we had been upgraded to a junior suite. A large bouquet of fresh roses and tulips was waiting to greet us. When this bouquet wilted, a different one replaced it. The food was excellent, although pricy. This hotel truely deserves five stars.

<Content>Do NOT stay here My girlfriend and I had a terrible time at the Hotel Raphael. Value for money is extremely low and I will never return to this establishment. If you are looking for a luxurious hotel in Paris, this is the wrong place to be.

<Content>Best for romantic dinner and drink I did not stay this trip at the hotel Raphael, but likely will next time. It is a gorgeous old hotel near the Arc. It is like old, elegant Paris. The staff were friendly, not stuffy when I went there for drinks. You must try the Jardin Plein Ceil which is a rooftop open air garden at the top of the hotel. The food is great and beautifully presented. Beware it is expensive, but try the open area lounge by the restaurant for champagne or cocktails Average champagne by the glass is $19 euros). Again it is expensive, but you can nurse one drink a long time and the staff doesn't bother you. It is so romantic with a view of the Eiffel Tower on one side and the Arc on the other. It is very tranquil and small. It doesn't get better than this. You sit amid a garden setting. They should add some soft french music or old standards via piano or in a pinch by CD. I am surprised the movies haven't found this spot as a location for a romantic scene. It seemed like Cary Grant or George Clooney should show up, but alas, you must bring your own Cary or George. This place is a well kept secret. Even my hotel conciege who knew alot had never heard of it. But it is small so book about 6 days in advance to be sure to get a spot, and take someone very special!
