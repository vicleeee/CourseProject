<Content>Horrible dirty bathroom! The clean room and bathroom is a basic requirement in a hotel even without any stars!!! here the maid forgot to clean the bathroom, I assume! dirt and hairs were all over the bath, in the tube, on the floor, on the table! however the bed was clean. The walls are soooo thin, that I thought they were made of paper! the location is good, mainly for those clients staying for 1-2 hours with a local 'lady'. I wouldn't go back to this hotel.

<Content>Budget hotel in great location I believe it is the best hotel location at the end of Orchard at bugis vicinity for its price.It is small but clean. The lowest price clean hotel with good location in that area.Expect a decent sleep, nothing luxurious. Across the road is 7 eleven and 24hr food court. Walking distance to bugis MRT, City Hall MRT and duoby ghuat MRT. Just a few bus stop away from Orchard Road.I would recommend to budget travellers who prefer a basic decent hotel to a guesthouse or inn.

<Content>over priced and dodgy This hotel was booked through Wotif.com and was a self rated 4star hotel, which included breakfast for AUD128.00. The location was quite good, 5 mins from the bottom end of Orchid Rd, 10 mins from Little India and Sun City.The room left alot to be desired, and was more like a double room in a hostel, to be honest. The lino on the floor was the first giveaway, along with the tiny reception. On arrival we were issued with breakfast vouchers and 1 room key. Our room was on the 11th floor, fairly quiet from street noise, however, we heard every step made in the corridor. The room size was crazy, not much larger than a double bed, no room for suitcases, the bed was one of the hardest I have ever tried to sleep in, aircon that didn't work, the room was freezing even when the aircon was turned off. At a minimum the room could have easily doubled in size. As it was I rang reception to complain, and was told we were already upgraded to a 'superior' room. I mentioned the pics on their website only to be told by the Manager these had been 'altered to look much bigger', HELLO! The only thing that was good was a nice hot shower. There was only room for 1 prerson in the bathroom at any one time. Breakfast was next door in the back of a nightclub, which was decorated in black and smelt like all good nightclubs do, was corn flakes, toast, cold scrambled eggs heated by old style bae-marie, tea and coffee.Our flight on the last day was at 830am, we were unable to have breakfast as it did not commence until 7am. If we were there for longer than 2 nights I would not have stayed at this hotel. Sorry, not a brilliant choice.

<Content>Budget Hotel While reading the reviews for this hotel before going to Singapore, I already expected the worse since i've already booked my reservations. If you set your expectations that it is a budget hotel then you won't expect too much. Staff is okay though the bell boys(or electricians) are not wearing uniform. I chose a standard room and to my surprise it was neat and groomed. The toilet is so-so, what's important is the hot and cold shower and clean toilet bowl. I was able to sleep well since i'm on the 7th floor. The hallway was narrow. The elder staff got me the nice room and even gave me two tickets to the river cruise. Overall experience - average.

<Content>Over Rated Hotel, Check Other Options had i know earlier, i would have stayed in this quaint apartment that i discovered near sommerset mrt station which is cheaper and has a common kitchen where you can heat food. rates are cheaper and place is cleaner, across is a chain of small restaurants and grocery. we booked online for a 5 night stay. although i was fore warned about the unfriendly frontdesk staff, i was surprised that they were quite receptive, considering it was the convention week, which btw has a rack rate of a whopping S$260!first two nights were okay, considering we were given a room with a balcony. the nightmare started on the 3rd day onwards when we requested frontdesk to tell housekeeping to clean the bathroom floor and replace the tissue bos we used up. everyday that we called for the bathroom cleanup until the day we left, it was not cleaned leaving it with a stench smell that we had to endure at night during sleep. note that houskeepers clean only during the day when we are out.frontdesk would always say yes to our request but we come home to a bathroom reeking of smell and the tissue box never came.you may want to forgo the free breakfast offer and opt for a cheaper rate, bec they don't change the food at all. its rice,eggs, sausage and beans every single day. a 24 hr fastfood is just across the street for a hot, reasonable meal.other than cleanliness, staff were accommodating to our other requests just didn't understand the bathroom thing.during our stay, i discovered a quaint apartment near sommerset mrt station which is cheaper and has a common kitchen where you can heat food. rates are cheaper and place is cleaner, across is a chain of small restaurants and grocery. next time i will surely stay there.

<Content>Great location, the room's a bit cramped though. Overall, I give the hotel a B- I was actually a bit apprehensive, with the not so rosy reviews posted by some of the travellers who stayed at Hotel 81 Bencoolen. But surprisingly, my parents and I had a pretty okay time at the hotel. Of course, we knew that we were not getting first class service, unlike those who previously stayed there. Anyway, we were actually impressed with the location of the hotel since it is right in the middle of the city. Most of the fancy museums, schools and decent eateries cafes are within easy reach. Orchard Road is practically 10 to 15 minutes away by foot. Regarding the room were we slept (we stayed on the 9th floor), it was VERY basic and quite cramped, considering that we chose the Triple, which was good for three adults. However, it was still okay since the amenities were complete and thank god, in okay condition. The bathroom was alright, bigger than what we've expected. Needs a little maneuvering though if you want to take a bath since the shower is handheld.Overall, we had a decent stay, but housekeeping, UNFORTUNATELY, was a big letdown. I'm not really sure if they know how to clean as the beddings were ALWAYS haphazardly arranged, and the floors, not properly swept. Another thing, the walls are kinnda thin, so we sort of heard the footsteps and converstaions of those staying next door. But the noise did not bother us that much as we only went back late at night at we're just too tired and sleepy to complain.

<Content>Average hotel, great location Checked in 81 Bencoolen and found that the pictures posted on the net were stretched and magnified and the rooms were actually cubby holes; definitely not for a small family, despite asking them about it earlier. We were allocated what the reception staff told us was one of the most spacious rooms, and was taken aback when I discovered our room actually faced a closed courtyard and other rooms. The corridors are like little alleyways on a boat with people of the night in the corridors. Apparently, they rent out rooms by the hour too (!!!!). Definitely not a place for a small family with children. Decent accomodation can be got for the same rates or a few dollars more a few hundred metres away at the YMCA (Orchard road) or YWCA (Fort Canning Lodge), where we did move to for the rest of our otherwise enjoyable stay. I must admit that 81 Bencoolen is ideally located for tourists with accessibility to transport and plenty of good affordable shopping options; also close to Bugis Street and Orchard Road. The staff at the hotel know that they are not really into providing an experience; they are just what they claim to be: an affordable, budget tourist hotel.

<Content>What A Nightmare ! During my 5-days stay at Hotel 81 Bencoolen, a purportly claimed 3 star hotel, I found unbelievable that the hotel's housekeepers did not use vacuum cleaner while tidy up rooms. Therefore, rooms were full of hair, dust and even tissue paper. Ants were found all over the dressing table, wash basin and sometimes on the bed. I just wonder how such a hotel obtain it's ISO certificate and is it a room worth USD100+ is about in Singapore ?

<Content>Not too bad In the past, I haven*t bothered about staying hotels like 81, 69 or wahtever. But at the helm of Air Show, all the other available hotel rooms were $300, 400, 500, 700 and more (per night) and we had no choice but to stay at Hotel 81Bancoolen.After reading the other comments, we were ready for dirty floor, dirty shower room and poor service. The impression changed after 1 night, - not too bad.It is in a central location - walking distance to Orchard, Ruffles, Suntec and few minites walk to MRT station if you are heading out further. The decent local restaurant Kopitiam is just across the road and Sevel-Eleven as well.The hotel staff does not bother you and house keeping is good. There is a hair dryer, internet connection, free bottle of water in the room.So we have ended up staying here for thye rest of the stay in Singapore. After all, it is what you expect and if the stay is value for the money.

<Content>Stay here only if.. Stayed here for four nights from the 26th to the 30th of December. 2 pax, me and my best friend. This is our first time staying in a budgeted hotel.All in all, so so.. Very much a budget hotel.The check in process was very slow although we already had our vouchers in hand. No roomboy to help, we have to drag our suitcases by ourselves, which was no problem on check in, but a big problem on checkout (we shopped a lot during our stay).The room was unbelievably cramped, we literally have to jump over suitcases just get to the other side of the room. Floor was dusty and to my surprise the pillowcases in our bed were made of some kind of disposable material which reminds me of a kleenex tissue.Bathroom was okay, a bit bigger than I expected since the room was very very small. Nice and clean.The thing is, I really don't recommend guests who bring children to come here. It could get nasty and scary at nights. You get to see hookers, drunken men and even transvestites.. Eeeyoughh..The good thing about the hotel is the location. Very good location. It's close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT (one of the biggest MRT station in Singapore) -- about 5 mins walk, and located just in front of the Kopi Tiam foodcourt which opens 24 hours a-day, a 7/11 also is close by. Bus stop in front of the hotel and buses going through Bencoolen mostly can take us to major touristic and shopping site in Singapore. So if you plan to travel like us, which is went out of the hotel at 9, back at 4 for a quick shower then off again until midnight (we spent the day exploring Singapore), this is your place. But if you plan to enjoy any luxury (there is none by the way), then find someplace else..

<Content>Pretty Awful Generally uncomfortable experience. Door lock broken. Hotel Internet broken. Bar of soap in bathroom? Not available. Bedside reading light? You must be joking. Interesting black mould between tiles in bath/shower. Worst of all. the mattress had a horrible plastic cover, which provided the distinct impression of sleeping on an incontinence sheet. These things might be bearable in a budget hotel, but at a minimum SGD159 per night it wasn't even particulary cheap. One night of this and I headed next door to the Bencoolen Hotel. Same price, but welcoming and comfortable.

<Content>Decent Hotel with Location Advantage We stayed at the hotel from 8 - 11 Nov on the 11 Floor in a DBL room. Had not expected much from the property, hence was not shocked. Room was small, but comfortable bed for 2 adt n 1 child. The room was not sparkling clean, as there was lot of dust on the floor corners and behind the TV. Everyday a bottle of water, 1 cup noodles, coffee/milo sachets were provided in the room. Daily toothbrush and shower caps were replenished. The choice was made based on the hotel location. Orchard Rd, Suntec City, Sim lim square, city hall are all within a walking distance of 10 - 15 mins. Dhoby Gaut MRT is 10 mins away. Also was a bit sceptical about the night activities in the hotel as trvlg with a small daughter, but was pleasantly surprised to find none. The breakfast is local buffet breakfast with bread and butter being served, though we never had bf at the hotel, as there was a small hawker centre opposite and kopitiam, delifrance arnd the corner. Will recommend this property for budget family travellers.

<Content>Good value, but could have been better. Wound up at this hotel after looking for a room not to expensive but in a decent shape - something really hard to find in Singapore. I was quite pleased when seeing the room, fairly new and modern with a view over the singapore skyline, but I quickly realised that it was not very clean on floors and the bathroom was a bit shabby. Overall though I must say that it is good value in Singapore standards, and I would probably return next time.

<Content>Budget hotel? I have been a regular at Bencoolen 81 over the past 3 years. Either for a weekend getaway with my girlfriend, or checking in for 2 hour transits, just to have some quality time with my girlfriend. Standards more or less remains the same over the years, with only one thing that is changing. The price of the rooms. The rooms are getting pricer each year, and now the prices even varies on weekends or public holidays. Previously the rates are standard. SG$20 for transit SG$79-89 per night.However prices now range from SG$30 for transit and $119-$150.Sometimes I wonder am i still checking into a budget hotel anymore, with the ever growing prices.But I will still go back to the hotel mainly for a few reasons. Location is good as it is walking distance from town, making it easy to make plans.Room is clean, with adequate facilities (hairdryer, thermal flask, television with cable channels, bathtub, etc) Pay $10 to get a DVD player room, although chances are you will have a spoilt remote, or the lack of one.

<Content>It was our first time in a budget hotel... and it will probably be our last. We stayed one night on a 5th floor room and another on a 7th floor room. We got a room on the 5th floor when we arrived in Singapore (on the way to Krabi, Thailand). It was big enough with a big enough toilet and bath plus a balcony. Back from our trip, there were no more balcony rooms (despite our previous reservation) so we got a room on the 7th floor. We barely fit in the room with our luggage. We keep on bumping our feet and arms/ hands on the wall, bed posts, etc. There was definitely no space to move around. The toilet and bath was half the size of the previous room. Rooms were clean. Both baths didn鈥檛 have shower panels or curtains thus it gets flooded when one is taking a shower. They do have hot water. You also get a cup noodle, milo, 3 in 1 coffee and a bottle of water; water thermos/ boiler also available in the room. Halls in the 5th floor smells like a laboratory. Check-in and check-out were quick and fuss-free. We were able to leave our luggage for storage for free after check-out. Location was excellent; train stations, convenience stores, coffee shops, malls nearby.Prices were SG$129 (5th floor room- holiday rate) and SG$109 (7th floor room- regular rate). It was acceptable although I did not expect it to be like that looking at the pictures on their website. If you do decide to stay there, it would be best to get a balcony room. Also bring your email confirmation for your reservations.

<Content>Terrible place. The Orchard Hotel said that they did not have a booking for me (despite my having proof from Opodo) but they found a room for me in Hotel 81. This was just about the only hotel room left in Singapore and I soon found out why. I was propositioned by a prostitute in the lift on the way up to my room and that set the tone for my stay. The hallway on the tenth floor was covered with cigarette ends. Always suspicious of dirty hotels I turned down the top bedsheets in my smelly room to find a very stained sheet with a couple of hairs. I got that changed pretty quickly, but with no apologies from the staff. The bathroom was covered in cigarette burns and the shower would only point at the wall, so I had to shower one handed. There was no shower curtain or screen so the floor got soaked. I went out for the evening and returned at around 12 to hear that there was an orgy happening on my floor. At least it sounded like that, with lots of screams and groans going on through the night. Oh yes, and the guy who wrote the previosu review is right about the lights. There are no switches by the bed. Ridiculous!What a grott hole and not cheap at Sing $160. Do not take your family there.And yes, they really do rent rooms by the hour!!!

<Content>Very small rooms. Inexpensive though. Not exactly the greatest place you'd want to stay with your family. From the website, it seemed that the rooms were big. In reality the rooms were cramped and lacked some basic things that I've come to expect of budget hotels. For instance a set of switches near the bed! One has to walk up to the door to turn off the lights and then fumble ones way back to the bed. Bad design! No shower curtain. Plenty of hookers... if thats what you want. We didn't. But we ran into a plethora of them in the hotel lobby since we returned back at 11pm one night after an evening tour of the city. But the hotel was clean and the staff was reasonably polite....oh well!
