<Content>Sensational hotel with that brand new smell I have been staying at the Embassy Suites since it opened roughly two years ago. The rooms are very spacious and luxurious. The Internet works flwlessly. The gym is relatively small but has top of the line equipment (and there are never a glut of guests working out). The breakfast (included) is excellent too. I travel quite a bit (I have earned 2 million miles just on American Airlines over the last 5 years) and this is my favorite hotel. The only minor criticisms that I would share are that (1) they installed generic brand elevators that leave you longing for the new intelligent ones and (2) the staff can trend towards being too aggressive in helping you. For example, I once checked in with a small carry bag on wheels and the bellboy almost ripped it from my grasp. But if the elevators continue to brake and the service staff chill out about 10%, this will continue to be my favorite hotel property. I highly recommend the Embassy Suites in Mexico City.

<Content>Fabulous Place to stay I read the other reviews and agree with them that the Embassy Suites Reforma is a Great Place to stay. The location is great, quick access to the Centro Historico and to Chapultepec, Zona Rosa etc. The concierge was excellent and even though I had lived in Mexico for years, knew how to get around and speak the language he had some great tips. The breakfast in the morning is wonderful, and the free drinks and snacks at night are both real money savers. Evita the restaurant downstairs is nice but there are many very nice places in the city. You must try Hacienda los Morales and San Angel Inn. Both places you can get to with the hotel arranging a taxi. All of the employees at the Embassy Suites were very friendly and cordial. The rooms are large, modern and clean. I had asked for a high floor and my request was honored. The maid service is also excellent with them cleaning the room while we ate breakfast every morning. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel This hotel was outstanding. The service was excellent, the room was fantastic. The staff was helpful each day no matter what we asked. One of the things we enjoyed was the breakfast each morning. You chose your fixings for omletes or you could have scrambled eggs. There was also fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, different kinds of breads, etc.

<Content>All you could want Wonderful hotel. The suites are spacious and well-presented - two large screen TVs! The service is excellent - very helpful, cheerful and good-humoured. The concierge service is especially great. We found this out when we wanted to take a trip to Teotihualcan (not to be missed). The advice was clear, informative and understanding. There was no attempt to push private tours, though this is what we did in the end. Same quality of advice about getting around the city and getting back to the airport. One brilliant thing about the hotel was the free cocktails every night!! A bit of a rush to fit three in the time slot, but well worth the effort.Visted 25 to 31 October 2008 and from Wales

<Content>Hands Down, Our Favorite Hotel Ever! We were absolutely thrilled with the rooms, the service, the location, the food - everything at this hotel was top-notch! The concierge was extremely helpful in arranging private tours to the pyramids at Teotihuacan and the Basillica and even a Segway tour of downtown Mexico City last minute. The head bellhop went above and beyond to get us taxis, teach us about the bus system and even ran to get us an airport to the taxi at the last minute.The breakfast was terrific and the service there was again great. They had the standard cereal/cold food station as well as a wide assortment of pastries and omelettes, pancakes and waffles made to order. A special treat was the nightly manager's cocktail hour where we were offered free drinks and appetizers.The rooms were spotless and very luxurious with nice views of the city, very well-appointed. The hotel features a great double- staircase in the front as well as a (very convenient) Starbucks on the main floor.I can't think of anything more I'd want from a hotel. They went above and beyond and we can't recommend them highly enough!

<Content>Great place We enjoyed last weekend's stay greatly aided by the superb staff at all levels.You have seen all the raves re: included breakfast and mgr's reception and I agree.The breakfast bacon is great (and I seldom eat it).Most MXN hotels/BBs no longer serve it as it's expensive here.El Caminero is the taco place just around the corner - make a right just out the hotel's front door, and an immediate right on to the side street off Reforma; walk about 75 meters to the other side of the street. You can't miss the orange facade.Possibly the best and cleanest in all of Mexico?6 Tacos for $64, pesos (about US$5.00 last w/e).The hotel has a Great location with easy walks to El Centro if you are in decent shape and the altitude is a nonissue on a clear day(we're mid 60 and 70, but live at 6700+ ft here in Mexico).Would not hesitate to stay here again and recommend it to nearly all.

<Content>Embassy Suites - great for families A family of 5 stayed twice at the Embassy Suites Mexico City at the start and finish of a trip to Cancun - once for 3 nights and another time for 2 nights.The 2 bedroom suite was suitable for us as there are 2 doubles in the bedroom and an extra sofa bed in the living room.It is not the largest of accomodations for 5 people but we managed.The service was outstanding throughout especially the concierge who was extremely helpful with booking a car and driver for us for a day trip,getting tickets to a folklore evening and general reccomendations on reatusrants etc.The breakfasts were a smorgasbord of good taste and the evening open bar and snacks were a pleasant respite from paying for drinks every evening.The location is OK - in a safe and central area on Reforma ave but still slightly too far for walking to the Centro Historico.All in all a good experience in Mexico City.

<Content>Very Nice Stay This hotel is great for couples or families. We had a great suite, clean with a nice view of Reforma. They also provided a car service for us, on request. This is more expensive than a taxi but a safer alternative.There were some unfortunate maintenance problems during our stay, but the staff worked as quickly and efficiently to resolve them as possible (there was a water leak into our bathroom from above and they helped us move into another suite and the elevators broke down at one point).The breakfast and manager cocktail reception are excellent. The food and beverages are high quality It's an excellent value.The pool was nice but chilly and the hot tub was uncomfortably hot.We ate in the Argentinian restaurant in the ground floor of the hotel both nights we were there and were pleased with the food and service.This is our new go-to Mexico City hotel.

<Content>Excellent Hotel! We recently traveled to Mexico City and stayed at the Embassy Suites for approx. one week. We chose the hotel based on the reviews provided by fellow travellers and we were not disappointed.The hotel is located on Paseo de la Reforma (close to the Centro Historico and to Chapultepec). It is right at the Glorieta Colon, and the Turibus stops in front of it.The hotel is fairly new and is very clean and well maintained. The rooms are big, like a suite, nice big bathroom, tvs, kitchenette. You have everything you need in the room, but if you need anything else you can call the 24 hour service line and they will help you with whatever it is you need. The hotel offers a complimentary breakfast buffet which is very good and very complete. Evita restaurant is also a great Argentinean restaurant, and there is also a Starbucks right in the lobby. The pool and jacuzzi were located in the basement and they were a great spot to relax after being all day in the streets of Mexico City. The gym is also right there.The best feature of this hotel is its staff. They are very friendly and nice to their guests abd very accommodating. They are ready to help you out whenever you need it. We felt as they were treating us like family, and this was very nice! The concierges are also present at the hotel from early in the morning until late in the evening and they can guide and help you in a very good way. We have them book tours for us with the private guides of the hotel to the Basilica de Guadalupe and the Pyramids. The price was good and what you get for it is priceless. Ask for Mr Fernando Piro. He is an excellent guide and taxi driver, and he can take you whereever you need to go. We used the hotel taxi service quite a lot. They are very friendly and helpful, and are also very reliable and on time. If you travel alone this is an excellent way to feeling safe in Mexico City, although we never felt unsafe while visiting the city.The concierge also booked tours for us with a touring company called Estur. We took a day tour to Puebla and Cholula, and another to Cuernavaca and Taxco. Both tours were excellent, with very pleasant and knowledgeable tour guides who speak both Spanish and English.We also bought tickets to the Ballet Floklorico Nacional. We recommend it. Very nice!Conclusion: if you are traveling to Mexico City stay at the Embassy Suites. You won't regret it. We highly recommend it and next time we're in Mexico City we will stay there for sure!

<Content>Wonderful stay The Reforma marked the start of almost a month round trip to Mexico for my wife and I, and this proved to be an excellent start. We spent 3 nights here, giving us two full days to explore some of the city. If returning to Mexico we would certainly be very happy to use the Reforma again.We found all the staff, without exception, to be courteous and helpful at all times. Our suite was large and extremely comfortable. One drawback was the slightly noisy air-conditoning. The buffet breakfast was delicious, offering an extremely wide choice and very attractively presented. Unfortunately, we were in a room towards the back of the building, overlooking some construction work. (No noise though, whatsoever) It might be worth requesting a suite overlooking the main street .. the Reforma. We used the in-house restaurant, 'Evita's' on one night and enjoyed the meal very much, though thought it was a little on the pricey side.We used the small pool in the basement ... and had it all to ourselves. The laundry service was excellent.We chose the Reforma, partly through recommendations on this site, but also for it's location between the two main tourist attractions ... the Zocola area and Chapultepec ... for us, both were within walking distance (about 30 mins and 50 mins respectively). Both are well worth a visit, particularly the Templo Mayor, the Castillo and the Zoo (free entrance, but full of school parties when we were there). The tourist circular bus trip is well worthwhile.We used an 'authorised' taxi from the airport to the hotel, costing 240 peso and got the hotel to arrange a return taxi which cost 270 peso. Be very wary of flagging down taxis or using 'unauthorised' ones. I would not entertain driving in Mexico City!

<Content>Loved the Embassy suites We stayed at the Embassy Suites in July and where very happy that we did. The building is somewhat new, the suites are larger than average, with 2 large flat panel tvs in each room, the view was spectacular from the 17th floor; also a large pull out bed in the second room. The pool was pretty nice located in the basement of the hotel, so didn't have to worry about the rain or thunderstorms outside. The breakfast had a cook for made to order eggs, pancakes, fruit, cereal, some local flavor food (chilaquiles, quesadillas) which was delicious - so the breakfast was excellent. In the afternoon from 6-8pm. there was a hotel managers reception wherein you get free drinks, including tequila, wine, beer, chips, nuts, etc. which was great for meeting with associates prior to going out to town for dinner. Our first night, we tried their Argentinian Restaurant - Evita, it was more of international menu instead of Argentinian for authentic Argentinian you need to go to a restaurant called Cambalache and another is called La Mansion. The hotel is located on reforma, walking distance to the Monumento a la Revolucion and within 10 minutes in taxi to the Bellas Artes and 15 minutes to the Zocalo - Main Plaza of Mexico City in front of the Cathedral. If you are there on Sundays, the hotel will loan you a bicycle to ride in the Reforma Street which is closed for traffic on Sunday so people can rollerblade and ride bicycles with their families. The hotel staff was very friendly. The hotel does not have a self parking, so you have to use the valet and the driveway is somewhat cumbersome. Also, be careful with the local police you try to make a left turn into the hotel in the afternoons, so you will have to make a right turn, then another and another to get onto the street that goes in front of the hotel which by the way is located in front of the Christopher Columbus (Glorieta Colon) which in spanish is Cristobal Colon. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great value! We booked this hotel based on Trip Advisor comments and the fact that all four of us (2 adults, 2 teenagers) could stay in the same suite. We were not disappointed. The view from the 17th floor was gorgeous, the bed was very comfortable, and the staff was accommodating and friendly. Free pool and workout room, and free internet access on the second floor. The location was great - walking distance to the metro station, Ballet Folklorico, and - a little further away - the Zona Rosa, and only a $3.5 peso bus ride away from the spectacular Anthropology Museum. MUCH more interesting than taking cabs, and perfectly safe. The only word of caution would be to book a rental car online ahead of time. Doing so from the hotel costs a small fortune, although the service was great, with the rental car company giving us a free ride to fill up the car and back to the airport. We'll definitely stay here again on our next visit.

<Content>Excellent value Huge suite rooms (can accommodate 6 easily), best of all were the great staff. Incredibly reasonably priced, and N American style buffet breakfasts. Ideal for large families.Only slight minus was that it is a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro.

<Content>Great place, small drawbacks Clean, classy, good breakfasts, brilliant managers cocktails in the evening (basically, an open bar from 18.30 to 20.00). Rooms spacious, two TVs (one in living room, one in bedroom), great staff, especially the porters. Which made the litle additional charges a bit annoying - we tipped the porter and bar staff directly, only to find additional tips added to our final bill. It wasn't enough to make a fuss about, but an irritation.Also, the hotel will kindly get you a taxi at any time, and they are secure - however, they are also vastly more expensive than the clean, fast and metered red taxis you can get on the street, which always gave us good service.Food in the Evita is good, but service - from the same staff as the hotel - is erratic. One meal was great, the other marred by long waits (e.g. it took three requests to get the bill).

<Content>nice stay, perfume stolen... We stayed for 4 nights in this hotel, actually it was nice, but when we where about to leave my wife didnt find her perfume, we searched everywhere in the room and we didnt find it, we called reception, they sent security and they said that they were going to look in the cameras, and also that day the maid from the day before was on her day out, so they couldnt ask her, so we had to leave to catch our flight and the receptionst told us that they were going to fix this, and a few days later i got mail from a lady (Mary Paz actually) shift manager and she told me that they asked the maid the next day and that they didnt find my perfume, but they were going to refund 25 dollars on my account. So she believed the maid and she got out with my Versace perfume 120.00 dollars. I am very angry with thismore then the cost of the perfume is the thingt that they didnt believe in the word of a customer.

<Content>Unbeatable service, huge value for money I have stayed at the Embassy Suites in Mexico City a few times already. I spend 90% of my time travelling throughout the Americas and I still have not found a better city hotel, and I am member of 5 other frequent guest hotel chains programs. The service they provide is remarkably good (Guest Services, Front Desk, Suite Services, Housekeeping, Laundry, 鈥? you name it), guest鈥檚 requests are never forgotten and solved immediately, and expectations are always exceeded. Superb Breakfast is included, courtesy evening cocktail, excellent business centre, delicious meals served at the Argentinean restaurant at the basement.I read a recent bad review (unfortunate experience) of this hotel a few days ago, and I happened to suffer the same issue at that time too. The Engineering department showed up immediately upon request (1 AM), and I was offered an immediate room change. They sorted it out the next day, and I changed back to my original room.In summary, Embassy Suites is a great hotel, great people at your service, very competitive tariffs (often MUCH cheaper than the ones in Santa Fe, the financial district), great location for both business and family travelers. What you get for the money you pay is outstanding, compared to any hotel in the city.

<Content>Lovely hotel This was a lovely hotel -- extremely comfortable having two rooms. The breakfast was delicious and the evening manager's reception was a treat. It was clean, staff was very helpful and friendly. The only minor complaint is the location. We don't take taxis if we can help it, we prefer using local transportation. It was 5 long blocks to the Metro and the hotel is in a business district near, but not in, the central part of the city. We walked a lot. If you are a taxi person you will probably find this to be a good location because it is just off a major road and probably a short ride to all the sites.

<Content>Unfortunate experience After reading all of the reviews on here, I was excited to stay at this hotel. Unfortunately, I did not have the same experience as most others.From the moment I entered my room, I noticed a loud thud coming from the roof - this noise occurred every minute or so, and it did not go away for the duration of my stay. I repeatedly asked for them to come look at the problem, which they did - 5 or 6 times throughout the two nights I was there - but they never fixed it. I asked them to move me after just a few hours in the room on the first day I was there but they kept saying they would send an engineer to fix the noise instead. Ultimately, only after I refused to have them send yet another engineer to look at my room (after the 6th time), did they finally allow me to change rooms. The worst part is that they did not once apologize for the issue and made it seem as if I was bothering them, when I was just trying to get some sleep (and I am not a light sleeper by any means). All in all, I was quite disappointed.

<Content>Great Conceirge I have one thing to add to the many favorable reviews - the concierge was excellent. I was travelling with two teenagers and the Concierge made sure that we had the right restaurants recommended, tickets to the folkloricko and the right tours booked.She was sharp, in charge and helpful. The hotel overall is perfect for family travel - the suites are comfortable, the beds great including the foldout, and you can't beat the value.

<Content>I love this hotel! I stayed at the Embassy Suites Mexico City for four days. I choose the hotel because I was traveling with a friend, and I did not want to feel cramped in a regular hotel room. I was not dissappointed! The rooms were modern and spacious. My friend and I never felt like were in each others way. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The restaurant Evita had good food. The area is safe as well. We went out walking late at night, and did not have a problem. Always use caution though, and I guess it helped that my friend was a big guy...but do use the hotel taxi's even though they may be a bit more expensive.

<Content>Only place to stay in Mexico City Wow, What a hotel. Staff was excellent, Breakfast was very good, Evita was good for steaks. Rooms are big and beds are comfortable. Wireless works well. Starbucks on ground floor, but Breakfast coffee was some of the best I ever had. Also very safe, with safe cabs.I will use this hotel again for my business trips to Mex. City.

<Content>Will not let you down! This hotel is great. It's pricier than a mid range hotel, but you will be impressed by the value for money and the service. I had a suite (bedroom plus lounge and bathroom with two massive TVs) for the equivalent of $130 per night (and that was including expedia's significant add ons - try booking direct through the hotel's website).The bathroom is very modern and the shower so powerful it could knock elderly relatives over unless turned on slowly.The wireless internet is $11 per day - the cheapest i've found (unless it's free). The service is helpful and friendly and the breakfast buffet is better than average (and complimentary).If I had to say something negative i'd say the location, while in between the two highly visitable areas of central Mexico city, isn't really close enough to either to mean you can live without taxis - Centro historico is 30 mins walk, and Zona Rosa/Chapultepec about 20 mins. But don't let that put you off - it's easy enough getting around. If anything would put me off it would have been the air conditioning which was loud enough to break noise pollution laws in some countries i'd imagine, but the hotel itself was cool enough to not need it on anyway (temp was about 25c in the day when I was there).

<Content>Fabulous and Comfortable My Husband booked this hotel after asking him to book another that was closer to the ruins of Teothihuacan. I am so glad him he booked this hotel instead.We arrived close to midnight and without any fuss we were checked in quickly and shown to our room. The suites are large! And wonderfully decorated. The sitting room has a flat screen tv, a comfortable sofa, chair and small dinette set. A large counter in the hallway has a small sink, refrigerator and coffee maker. ****FYI the coffee package also containers the sugar and creamer***** The bathroom was spacious and well appointed. One word of caution...use the handrail to get in and out of the shower, the enclosure is high. The robes, slippers and towels are soft and plush. The bedroom is large and the bed is almost as comfortable as a 'heavenly' bed, there is also a flat screen tv in this room. We booked our room with the breakfast option and it was well worth it. They have made to order eggs and bacon. Potatoes, sauage and other goodies in warming trays. Regular and sweet breads, cereals, fresh fruits, juices and yogurts are also avaible.On the first level there is a Starbucks and small convience store. I was amazed that not once did we hear any of the housekeepers or other guests in the hallways. The staff was warm, friendly and extremely helpful and courteous.Without a doubt I will ask my Husband to book this hotel again when visiting Mexico City. It was safe, comfortable and relaxing.

<Content>Loved Our Stay Arrived in Mexico City with my family and didn't know what to expect. Our whole stay was GREAT. Starting with the Hotel. The staff were very kind and friendly. We had a Welcome Cocktail included in the rate.. and for our surprise.. the breakfast was also included! Our room (Suite 1404) had an EXCELLENT view of Plaza Colon and Reforma Street. The beds were reaaaaaally comfortable. We went to the indoor pool and enjoyed the jacuzzi for a while. I will DEFINITELY recommend this hotel and if I ever go back to Mexico City, I'll stay at the Embassy Suites again. Monica Tola (Lima, Peru)

<Content>Outstanding Value, Wonderful Experience This was our first trip to Mexico City and we happen to visit during the Easter Holiday. We took a chance on the Embassy Suites Mexico City - Reforma based upon the Tripadvisor reviews - we were not disappointed! The Hotel was wonderful in all aspects from the room rate, the room itself, the buffet breakfast and most importantly the knowledgeable concierge staff.We highly recommend this hotel for first time or repeat visitors to Mexico City. While in Mexico City we relied upon a local guide to show us the sights and he did a great job - reasonable price and no worries. If you need a guide let us know and we'll provide the details.

<Content>Very good value I can whole heartedly agree with the comments that everyone has made, the staff are very well trained and the concierges are very attentive.The gym is nice and compact and there are even laundry facilities there with dryer as well, at a reasonable rate ( 拢3.00 wash and dry).My only slight complaint is the price of the taxis there; we found other hotels that charge 50% less for taxis than them.And these taxis were the radio controlled secure ones, not the green and white Beetles.As another reviewer stated they should maybe adopt a different price strategy to there cabs to be more competitive.But all in all a fantastic place to stay in Mexico City

<Content>Clean  My two room suite was very large, clean and comfortable. It had 2 flat screen tv's and a nice view from the bedroom. The bed was very comfortable. The staff, especially the bellmen, were very helpful and friendly. One in particular followed up with me to ensure an issue I had the previous day had been resolved.I was not able to make the evening cocktail reception during my short stay but the breakfast buffet was very good. I enjoyed the made to order huevos rancheros.Traffic in Mexico City is horrendous. Thankfully, the drive from hotel to airport only took about 30 minutes. I suggest pre-arranging ground transportation in advance to the extent possible.

<Content>Check your buttons! Nice big rooms, great bar (free each evening for a couple of hours), attentive service. For me, this is not a great location, as there is nothing in walking distance. However, be careful with your laundry. I handed a blazer in for dry cleaning and was wearing it to a meeting when I was asked where the buttons were. Good question, as there should have been 12 of them and they were ALL missing. The laundry had taken all of them off and not replaced them. When I got back they quickly put them back on - badly - and they're all coming off again!! Bizarre.

<Content>Best value ever -- excellent experience at a bargain I booked on the hotel website. This hotel only has suites. They are divided in three categories. I booked a lower-end suite on the basis of the net direct/advance payment rate of 143 dollars (i.e. around 97 euros at the time).And what did I get for this?Simply the best-value room I've ever seen. When we showed up at 7 in the morning they apologized that the room wasn't ready yet. The reception staff were very nice and smiling and efficient. So we left our bags there and explored Mexico City that morning. When we came back we got a top-floor corner suite of about 50 square metres including two huge flat-screen TVs, nice sofas and an excellent bed.The gym was small (about 5-6 machines plus about 4 cardio treadmills and bicycles) but clean and inviting, with lots of available towels, water and apples. The pool area was also very nice (although windowless and in the basement), with lots of chaises longues, excellent lighting and nice blue and gold mosaic.And the breakfast was amazing, with cooked-to-order eggs with lots of vegetable, cheese, bacon and toppings (plus lots of other sweet and salty stuff). Excellent service in the breakfast room too.I got the IHT delivered to my room every morning at 8 and when I asked for a power plug adaptor it took them about 30 seconds to deliver it at my door. And checking out took about 10 seconds.Ah, and the location is unbeatable, with Insurgentes metro station, Polanco and the city centre (Zocalo etc) all nearby (by Mexico City standards).Overall: a near-perfect experience. For 97 euros this was simply amazing.

<Content>great hotel-plus a word of warning I agree with all the comments that were previously written about this hotel ...comfortable and large suites, great location, friendly staff, great breakfast , enjoyed the manager cocktail, good concierge service ...but I would like to add a word of warning concerning the taxis booked through the Embassy Suites. I noticed that they are 30 % to 100 % more expensive when booked through the hotel. For instance, the cost of a taxi from the hotel to a restaurant was 190 pesos and to come back we only paid 100 pesos , both transfert were with private car service. We paid 115 pesos from the bus terminal to the hotel compared to 210 pesos when done with the hotel and lastly from the hotel to the airport , the hotel charges 260 pesos but the cost for the same taxi ride from Fiesta Americana Hotel or Imperial Hotel ( across the street ) costs 200 pesos.I notified the hotel that they might need to revise the cost of the taxis in order to give a better value for their clients.

<Content>much more than we expected We ended up booking our room at the Embassy Suites at the last minute because I was told by friends in Mexico City that our original hotel was not in a safe walking neighborhood. Our expectations were not very high, but we ended up loving the Embassy Suites. My husband, 2 kids (12 and 15) and I stayed for 5 nights after 3 nights in Puebla and we loved the hotel. The service was outstanding, especially the concierges - Antonio and Edwardo. They helped us with tours, dinner reservations and even got my husband and son tickets to Lucha Libre (mexican wrestling) which they loved. The free buffet breakfast was delicious and varied and a truly amazing value for a family of four with a growing teenage son. The location was better than I thought - we walked regularly to Alameda Park, the Zocalo as well as to Zona Rosa for dinner. The suite was very large and great for a family - there is a real door that closes between rooms. It worked out very well for our family.

<Content>Great stay at the Embassy Suites We stayed at this hotel - Xmas week 12/25 thru 12/31. Chose hotel based on member reviews. Wow what a great hotel. It's a good 4 star , Doesn't have a fancy lobby or coffee shop but there were several outstanding features1) Room was Incredible. There were 3 of us - 2 adults - 1 teenager - She had her own ensuite room with HD TV . Ours was similar - very well appointed, huge room, marble everywhere.2) Staff were amazing - They all spoke great english and were unbelievably helpful - especiially the front desk and tour desk. I wish I could remember some of their names . when I read some reviews of other hotels, we really were fortunate to have such a great staff, that really went out of their way to help us.3) They have a great pool/execise area in the basement - it's spacious and beautiful.4) Breakfast - included in the room rate - was outstanding. They made the usual American eggs to order, but had a great choice of Mexican dishes as well. It's one of the best breakfasts I've had in years.5) There's a free happy hour with Hors d'oeuvres, They could do with redecorating the dining room/coffee shop - The munchies are pretty basic - mostly fried fillers.6) The rate was good - we paid about $110 a night for 3, with breakfast includedThere's an unbelievably expensive Agentinian steak house on the ground floor - as well as an equally expensive Starbucks.Overall the place is fantastic. - It's well located on the middle of the polanco. It's a pretty quiet , commercial section, but we used to walk to the city center /Zocolo each night after dark. We never felt worried, there were plenty of people and there were cops hanging out everywhere. Not sure I'd walk down some of the side streets - but the main street are fine.We loved MC. everybody in my office turns up their nose and says why would you go there' - We had a great week, the Mexican people were wonderful and there were some Wonderful places to visit - and we never got ill once !.

<Content>Excellent choice! I have stayed in Mexico City several times, the last stay being at the Four Seasons, which is, of course, fabulous. I actually prefer the Embassy Suites because of the large rooms (and it is a REAL suite, not just a room with a divider) and the wonderful breakfast, included in the price. The hotel is new, the decor is sleek and beautiful, the service is impeccable, and the food is excellent, both at breakfast and at Evita, the Argentine restaurant off the lobby. The exercise facilities are nice, and the pool is small but there is a jacuzzi to relax in, as well as many (mostly empty) lounge chairs to chill out in. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Mexico City, for business or vacation. This will definitely be my first choice for my next trip to DF.

<Content>All-Round Excellence We stayed at the Embassy Suites Reforma during January 2008, and we loved it. It had a very convenient central location on the beautiful tree-lined Paseo de la Reforma. The rooms were very comfortable and quite large, and we were very impressed with the service - staff at the hotel were extremely helpful, from the concierge to the bell-boys.

<Content>Great value and service We spent a week in Mexico City, six nights at the Embassy Suites and two at the Four Seasons. Can't say enough nice things about the E.S. The suite was big enough for the five of us (two adults, two teens and an almost teen). It was clean and well appointed (two flat panel tv's, mini-fridge, ironing board). The maid service came twice a day, cleaned in the morning, pulled out the sleeper sofa bed and turn down the other beds at night. They kept us stocked with bottled water (necessary in Mexico for those of us from up north). The workout room had a nice selection of equipment, with little towels and bottles of water on a side table. The pool and hot tub worked well with the kids. Between 6-8pm there is the manager's happy hour with free drinks and snacks. The staff was all very friendly and helpful. But the best part of the E.S. was the breakfast in the mornings. They have eggs made to order, two types of juice, lots of cut fruits, cereals, coffee, teas, pancakes, and more. The six nights we spend at the E.S. cost $1400ish US after taxes and the two at the Four Season cost $950 (because we had to have two rooms, maximum of three to a room). The F.S.price does not include breakfast or the occasional cocktail. When we go back to M.C, we are staying at the Embassy Suites.

<Content>Don't travel alot, but loved Embassy We needed to go to Mexico City to visit our daughter who is studying there. As infrequent and frugal travelers, we wanted a place that would be comfortable to return to after exploring the city . Embassy Suites was the right choice for our family. No matter what your budget(ours was tight), a person can find everything they need here. You can experience Mexican culture, but are able to find someone to help out in English when needed.  Enrique the concierge treated us as very well during our stay and was sensitive to our needs(not wanting to spend more than needed). He was also very upfront about what was okay to do and what wasn't. We felt very safe during our time in Mexico City...the people were wonderful.  Every single one of the staff was helpful, friendly and all about service excellence. The things that stood out for us were, the concierge service provided...from helping us rent a car, to calling a safe taxi for our daughter to take back to her school at night when needed, they were there; we used the washing machine/dryer several times during our stay; our older teen/early twenty-year olds loved the exercise room; the staff that allowed us to break a few small rules such as allowing our daughter to sleep over with us without creating a fuss; the breakfast service was out of this world;and the housekeepers did an excellent job as did room service. Jorge even arranged a larger car to take us to the airport when we left. It is doubtful we will ever be back to Mexico City, but if we did, this is where we would stay no questions asked. No one in our group became ill, but if we had, Embassy Suites would have been a piece of heaven to stay at. Our only regret is that we couldn't leave larger tips for the services provided.

<Content>Sincere Gracious Service My husband, an architect, and I just returned from a memorable week at the Embassy Suites Reforma! We had considered 3 other hotels before choosing the ES on the basis of the intelligent, thoughtful, glowing reviews of other visitors. Thank you trip advisors! This is the way a hotel should be run! Everyone from bellboy to housekeeper were not only impeccably professional, but genuinely concerned that our needs were met. Excellent breakfasts, delightful mgrs. choice happy hour. Gisela and Enrique were enthusiastic, knowledgeable and truly helpful in planning trips to places like the Luis Barragan home/museum now a UNESCO world heritage site, the Saturday art market in San Jacinto Square, walking tours of Coyoacan . Decor understated but luxurious and well-planned. Finally a hotel counter large enough for all our toiletries! Excellent extras like ironing board and wall safe. A high ceilinged glamorous lobby with 2 spiraling underlit staircases leading to lobby. Very large dramatic fresh flowers under a 25' blownglass floral chandelier that evoked the color and joy that is Mexico.How nice to be able to recommend a hotel so whole-heartedly.Thank all of you for suggesting Moon Guide and JJ's An Opinionated Guide for the Curious Tourist.The city is spectacular! Museums like nowhere else.Kudos to everyone at the ES REforma!MaisouiNewMexico

<Content>Great, Fantastic, Wonderful Every moment at this hotel was great...check-in, the room, breakfast, open bar at happy hour, work-out facility, pool, maid service, and bell man arranging car services. This hotel gave service like you would expect at hotels 3x the price but usually do not receive. There is a good Argentine restaurant and a Starbucks on ground floor. I will definitely return when I visit Mexico City.

<Content>no better place to stay in Mexico City I'm happy to see people are giving Embassy Suites the credit they deserve. The hotel is beautiful: luxurious suites with 2 flat screen TVs and every amenity required, a lovely breakfast room and bar area, and all is in like-new condition.The breakfast was terrific, including made-to-order omelets, fresh pastries, good coffee (in addition to the Starbucks in the lobby).The hotel hosts a complimentary happy hour from 6-8, which includes hot and cold hors d'oeuvres and a full bar.The location is great, within walking distance of the Alameda Central and the Zocolo,Best of all, the staff could not have been more helpful. We met with Gisela and/or Enrique every morning, and they helped us plan our outings, providing useful tips that came in handy each day.My only complaint is that the internet access costs $11 per day for those of us who are not Hilton Honors members. That seems steep to me. Some were able to access the internet for free inside Starbucks, but I had no such luck. This is a tiny grievance and should not discourage anyone from staying there. I found the best rate on Embassysuites.com by paying the full price in advance. Enjoy!

<Content>as good as the reviews said... Credit where credit is due..... I was a little bit sceptical of all the positive reviews on tripadvisor (before I went) but have to say that this hotel met expectations. The staff are all genuinely helpful and friendly including an excellent conceirge.The rooms are great.The only slight negative was the cost of the hotel taxi service (three times that of a local radio cab) but at least you know it is safe.The only problem was after the Embassy suites the other hotels we stayed in mexico were not as good.

<Content>A great hotel and a great price My husband, 7 year old daughter and I stayed at the Embassy Suites for 7 nights during this winter holiday and we loved it. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. They even have a washer and dryer available, a real boost for anyone travelling with children. The suites are very roomy with the living room being more than ample for the fold out couch. The buffet breakfast has something for everyone. It is located exactly 2 miles from the entrance to Chapultapec Park and a little less tha a mile from the Palacio de Belles Artes and the Zocalo. The bus runs up and down Ave. Reforma all day so if you dont' feel like walking you can just hop the bus for 25 cents. The metro stop (Hidalgo) is about a 10 minute walk away and from there you can get virtually anywhere in Mexico City that your heart desires (yup for 25 cents). My husband who travels weekly on business rates the service at this hotel as some of the best he's gotten. We highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good choice Definitely a good choice for staying in Mexico City. Seemed to have all the necessary business amenities. Most of the staff that I encountered spoke English well, probably because the vast majority of the guests seemed to be Americans. Rooms and facilities are well tended to, beds are comfortable, all suite rooms are a good size, staff is generally helpful and friendly. However, the hotel does not seem to be well known and I did not encounter even one taxi driver who had heard of it during my entire stay- so be sure to make a note of the street address. Other than that, this is a good choice for a hotel in Mexico City.

<Content>Embassy Suites - Convenience and Good Service My family and I just returned from a 6-day vacation in Mexico City. We booked two suites at the Embassy Suites-Reforma and found the place more than adequate. I can see why it would be very popular with both tourists and businesspersons. It is about a 15-minute walk to the Historic Center. It is located right on Reforma - Mexico City's beautiful major artery along which are located many office buildings. I understand the building itself used to be a government building but you couldn't tell that from the excellent renovation and new furnishings. Service is first-rate most of the time. The breakfast room does get crowded at times but then again we were there during the holidays when there were a lot of other families vacationing. The concierge can arrange for just about any tour or transportation you need. I would recommend doing that but I did find that prices kept on varying depending on the concierge you deal with. For most destinations, the hotel has published rates. Ask to see their rate card to ensure that you are at least getting a standard rate. Overall, a very good hotel that we can highly recommend. Anyone who is interested in the name of the excellent tour guide we had can contact me off-line.

<Content>Love the brand-new Embassy Suites! Will stay here again! We chose the Embassy Suites based on the reviews on TripAdvisor. We are so glad we did! The hotel is brand new (celebrating its first year on Jan. 1, 2008), and the accommodations are top-notch. We booked a room with two extremely comfortable double beds in one room and a pull-out couch in the other room -- ideal for a family of four. Both rooms had flat-screen TVs (a plus for the kids). We got a great deal on the room. Since December tends to be the low season, we got rooms online for $100 per night. We returned after a five day trip to Acapulco and paid $129 per night. Upon our return, the room contained a nice card welcoming us back and a card from the manager. A very nice, personal touch that made us feel even better about a wonderful hotel.The complimentary breakfasts are amazing. A full buffet with cook-to-order omelettes, traditional Mexican dishes, lox, fresh juices, a full selection of pastries and breads, a beautiful array of tropical fruits, cereals, and more. There is also a complimentary managers reception in the evening.Service at the hotel is very attentive. Other highlights: the gym, pool and a self-service laundry for a low-price. The location is good. We walked to the zocolo and other sites in one direction and Chepultepec Park in the other. This is a wonderful hotel for families with small children or teens, as well as adults traveling. We would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Ok, but not great I had read all the outstanding reviews here of this property before making my reservation to stay there this month. I was in town for an industry meeting and stayed two nights. It does have a kind of boutique feel and reminded me somewhat of the Doubletree Washington D.C. But I wasn't as impressed as the rest of you have been. 2 out of the 3 lifts didn't work while I was there. The furnishings in my room were nice and new, but the A/C fan in the room doesn't shut off ever even if it reaches the set temperature, and it's loud! The public area is really small and the hotel has no buzz about it. For some that may be a positive.The staff did want to help however they could and repeatedly asked me about my stay. They spoke good English and were able to hail taxis for me. You'll need a taxi too because I found the location somewhat inconvenient. It seems like it's in between major areas along Reforma. My meetings were at the Intercon Presidente - not a far ride away but a bit expensive fare. Next time I think I'll try the W Hotel near the Intercon Presidente.

<Content>Great Hotel, a little Pricey but worth it! I stayed in this hotel for a week on a business trip. I have to say it's amenities and services were great. There is a 2 hour cocktail hour everyday from 6-8 where you can get free drinks and snacks, while tipping of course, and breakfast is also free and a huge variety of items to choose from. The hotel also has a nice hot tub, work out room, and pool in the basement level. They also have business services and currency exchange and a Starbucks on the ground floor areas. It is also located in the Reforma district and in front of the Turibus stop where you can hop on and take a 4 hour tour of the city for nearly 100 peso's per day or 150 peso's for a 2 day weekend pass, which is well worth it. The area is also central to many great tourist area's, museums, downtown, and shopping areas. If you plan on driving, the valet is $8 per day which is comprabable to most 4 or 5 star hotels. Overall I had a great experience at this hotel and if needing to go back, I wouldn't mind staying at this hotel again.

<Content>Excellent Location  Excellent location, restaurants are few  far between, but the location is wonderful and everything is just a few steps away. The bus stop is around the corner, the 'metro' is only 5 pleasant blocks of a walk away. The staff was quite attentive, repairs in the room were taken care of almost immediately, especially when we were gone for the day. The buffet breakfast was excellent, with nothing missing, or needed aside from what they had prepared. The cocktail hour in the evenings was very nice, but appetizers were not always available as you had to arrive immediately when it was opened, but drinks were never a problem. Tours can be arranged with the 24/7 concierge  you are able to charge them to your room without any hesitation. Would return to this hotel for business or pleasure without any 2nd thoughts, thank you.

<Content>Great hotel with excellent service The Embassy Suites is located at Paseo Reforma. The historical centre of Mexico City is a 20 minutes walk or a short taxi ride away. Except for the steakhouse in the hotel itself, there are only few restaurants in the immediate neighborhood of the hotel, but the restaurants of Zona Rosa can be reached within a few minutes.The hotel is new, the two-room suite was very large, nicely decorated, clean and quiet. Flat-screen LCD TVs are provided in both rooms. Wireless internet access is available in the rooms. The bathroom was spacious and clean, and free bottled water is provided each day.The staff was extremely friendly and efficient. The excellent breakfast buffet with made-to-order omelettes is included in the room rates.The Embassy Suites is well worth the price, in particular compared to other four-star hotels in the area. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>World class hotel finally is here!!!!!!!!!!!!! Joaquin, Tucson, AZ Finally, I world class and well known hotel opened in Mexico City. Located at Paseo Reforma makes this hotel unique, accessible within walking distance to many places such as Zocalo Plaza, Independence Monument, and within few miles Museums, the Zoo and other turist attractions. The hotel personnel are great, friendly and dedicated to make your stay unforgetable. Breakfast (full) is the best. I recommend a tipical plate called Chilaquiles Rojos(made of tortilla) they are good!!! No more to say. We all know how good are the Embassy Suites in the states. I used to stay in another well known hotel in Reforma close to work but not anymore. Thanks,

<Content>4-5 Star Excellence Adding to what has already been written, this is an brand new, high quality property that has still to be discovered. Differences vs regular Embassy Suites:1) Extensive Breakfast: local fruits  foods; chef makes a great huevos rancheros2) Beautiful basement pool, spa and fitness room3) Highly efficient staffed business center: fast and professional help with color and b/w printing4) Concierge that arranged excellent local car service (vans @ 200P/hour)5) Extremely high quality room construction and amazing beds/linnens/pillows6) Managers reception that includes liquor7) A handy-dandy Starbucks in the lobby.8) High-end bar/restaurant attached (didn't try it)Location is central and 10 minutes from Polanco.I highly, highly recommend it to business travelers as a lower price but same/higher quality than Polanco. I have stayed at the Intercontinental Presidente and this property blows it away.Paid $189/US for a Premier Room: large window, large table for work.

<Content>4 Seasons Quality-Suite Price I am not the type to gush about Suite Style Hotels. However, I must commend Embassy Suites for their new property in Mexico City. The hotel is well located on the Paseo de La Reforma and boasts a full service Starbucks in the lower lobby. The hotel is new( 6 months ?) and looks it. The highlights are the rooms.First you get two rooms for price of one. There were two flat screen LCD TV's ( 36 inch ?) in my suite. Marble in the bathroom. The beds were very comfy with similar linens,pillows etc that you would find at the Ritz or 4 Seasons. The staff was friendly and appeared happy to be there ! There was an excellent buffet breakfast included !All for $159/night plus tax !Negatives would include noisy AC and only one window in the suite. Also, the business center is small and cramped. The biggest minus is that you need to cab it to Polanco for most dining options.The hotel was a great value relative to other 4-5 star alternatives. A pleasant surprise !

<Content>World Class Customer Service at Embassy Suites from a road warrior My 23 year old sister and my 15 year old brother were in Cancun when rumors of Hurricane Dean frightened us. There were no flights out and we did not want to risk it. So we got on a bus and drove 24 hours to mexico city!! We picked Embassy Suites because of the reviews on tripadvisor. We did not care much for Mexico city but we were blown away by the way we were treated by the hotel staff. I have never experienced customer service anywhere the way I experienced customer service at this hotel. After such a firghtening experience we felt right at home at this hotel. From the bell boy to the front desk staff were all fantastic. Hotel was very nice and clean. In fact, they came in while we were out in the afternoon and re-cleaned our room and un-did our bed so that we could easily go under the covers. This was a world class experience. I am a road warrior and I stay at a different hotel every week from Hyatt to Holiday Inn but I have never experienced such customer service before. And No, it was not more expensive. We booked our hotel for a Monday night(usually expensive) on a Saturday and it was $150/night and it was in the same range as the other hotels. Over all it was great. Thank you Embassy Suites.

<Content>Great new hotel! We really enjoyed our stay here. The hotel was clean, safe, and centrally located. The service was excellent. The two-room suites make this an excellent choice for families who need a little more room to spread out. The complimentary breakfast buffet was a great bonus, allowing all four of us to fill up before a day of sight-seeing. The only downside was a noisy air conditioning vent. Overall, it was well worth the money. We will certainly go back.
