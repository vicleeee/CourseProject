<Content>Not what we expected We chose the Bali Spirit Hotel based on the great reviews from other travelers and amazing photos posted on their website. We booked a 3-night Spirit and Relaxation package offered by the hotel. Upon arrival the hotel staff was very friendly and helped us settle into our room. After a 5-night stay on Sanur Beach, the standard room seemed very dull and unlike the photos we had seen online, the toilet did not flush, etc. Through our stay, the food offered by the resort, whether it be the complimentary breakfast, the poolside menu, or the romantic dinner included in our package, was terrible. We instead chose to eat the majority of our meals at the amazing restaurants in the town of Ubud. Our package included a couples massage which after arriving we were told could not be done together because they did not have two massage therapists on staff at the same time. Instead they insisted that we each schedule 1 1/2 hour massages separately while the other waited, very much taking away from the couples getaway that we had anticipated. We chose to skip this part of the package and received no compensation from the resort. The distance from town was nice although with close proximity to the road we did hear road traffic throughout our stay. We liked the distance from town and actually had a very nice moonlit walk one night from town to the resort. Overall, just not what we expected.

<Content>A tiny slice of heaven We spent 5 glorious nights in Ubud and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Bali Spirit. We stayed in one of the Legong suites which gave us a view over the gorges that make up the hotel property. the rooms have aircon, though we turned ours on only briefly in the afternoon, after a long day out. Didn't need it at night. Our bed was huge and comfortable. Only problem was that the bath, which came with a tub, had no shower curtain. Breakfast was substantial if you wanted the American style, or flavorful and very adequate, if you went for Balinese. Either way it was very good; we got fruit, lots of coffee and warm smiles. As you'll see, it's the Balinese who make Bali really special. We thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the servers and porters who made our visit so comfortable. I got a massage on premises, which was both very moderately priced and just fantastic by US standards. The hotel is located quite near the Monkey Forest, and a walk through that (about 15 mins) took us into the center of Ubud. I'd recommend trying this at least once; the forest is shaded and pretty cool, and you're thoroughly entertained by monkey antics. The hotel's shuttle service, which runs once every 2 hours or so, served us well the rest of the time.

<Content>Mediocre We booked for three nights, but checked out after one night. It wasn't so awful, I suppose, but we stayed at the Tegal Sari for 3 nights right before (TS was fully booked after that, so we had to move) so we knew what other hotels in Ubud had to offer. Our room at Bali Spirit cost $100, twice as much as our Tegal Sari room, and it wasn't nearly as nice. It was so dark that it was hard to read in it at night. The bed looked nice, but it was hard and uncomfortable. The balcony was so small that there was room for two chairs facing each other across a small table, but you could not put the chairs next to each other. The river gorge is nice when you are right next to it, for example when you are in the restaurant, but when you are in your room you don't see it. You only see the tops of trees. There is a nearby bridge across the gorge which has a lot of traffic that you hear constantly. Extras, such as laundry and minibar, were much more expensive than in other places we stayed. The website mentions special Balinese outdoor shower. What a load of BS. The outdoor shower is an indoor shower with a 20 cm high hole cut in one of the walls to let the bugs and the heat in, but you certainly know you are indoors. There is in fact no proper shower. The whole room is the shower, so the whole floor gets wet when you shower and when you get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom you get back into bed with wet feet. The location is inconvenient. It is a very long walk to Ubud (maybe 45 minutes or more) and much of it is along a road that is not interesting, so you have to depend on the shuttles, which leave every hour or two and drop you at a centralized location. (Compare this to the Tegal Sari, which had a personal shuttle available at all times to take you wherever you wanted.) This makes it hard to go out to restaurants at night. When we told then we were leaving they quickly offered to discuss the price, but we told them that we just didn't like the room. We went to Artini 3, where we paid $45 for a room that we liked much more and that was available without booking ahead of time.

<Content>Another great stay at Ubud Bali Spirit Hotel and Spa was a five night stay for 4 Adults in Ubud in June 2008. It was just lovely. It was a fourth holiday in Ubud for 2 of us and we were not disappointed. The other couple had not been to Bali before but were really happy with the Bali Spirit. It is not a five star accommodation but who needs that in Bali with places like Bali Spirit.The staff, meals, pool and views were all great.it was just a lovely break.I would recommend this too any one, just one catch with any accommodation in Ubud, bank on A LOT of stairs.Bali Spirit is just across the road from an Orphan day centre. They are looking for people to sponsor children for their education costs. Please consider this as it's a trivial amount for us to pay.

<Content>A delight Breakfast overlooking the river, the wonderful scenery, the pool and it's bar! and charming staff made for 10 days of pure heaven. Good value too. I guess the food could have been more exciting but had it been we probably would have never left the hotel. It being our first time in Bali, we availed of all the hotel facilities, in hindsight, you'll find all the same classes/ spa cheaper in Ubud. Our Tantric ;-) suite was lovely and many 's a happy moment was spent by husband, on the veranda, drinking chilled Bintang!We'll be back !

<Content>Sensational Spirit We have recently returned from the Bali Spirit  loved it! Travelling with two families (4 adults  5 children aged between 7  13 ) we arrived to a smiling welcome, cold drink  fresh towels. The first room we were given was not suitable (balustrading on balcony not safe for young children) so we were quickly allocated another room. As previously rated there are many stairs - very difficult for young children or the elderly.I cannot even describe how great the staff are - always friendly  smiling  happy to accomodate any requests. They also love to hang around  have a chat - the Spirit definately operates on Bali Time!Breakfast is very nice and we also ate lunch a few times - also very good. Also did the cooking class including market tour which was excellent. Pool  pool bar are great - have a laugh at the locals all coming down to the river for a bath at around 5pm. Massage was wonderful - very relaxing!The complimentary shuttle bus will take you into town at set times or you can hire it any other time for $10US for the whole bus ! ( 8 seater ). We ate at some fantastic restaurants including Casa Luna  Nomads ( also the place next to Nomads - can't remember the name ) and if you visit Ubud you will realise you are very spoilt for food up there! This tiny hotel set in the jungle on the cliff overlooking the river truly encompasses the Spirit of Bali  it's people - dont miss out !P.S. Anyone travelling to Bali regardless of where you stay - please take any old clothes, toys, books, school supplies with you  donate them ( there are many orphanages - google Bali Orphanages or contact me for details ) to these wonderful people who could really use a little of our help.Cheers Roz

<Content>Paradise at Bali Spirit hotel We (family of three) stayed in River Villa. We loved the place. The pool was superb, perfect for a quick dip mid afternoon dip before getting ready to head into town again. My seven year old loved drinking lemonade at the pool bar (whilst sitting in the pool, sooo cool) Regular Free of Charge shuttle into Ubud (5 minute drive) but less than 5000 ind rupiah (30p) each at other times. Villa on two floors - downstairs consisted of kitchen area with double sink, fridge and kettle (tea and coffee sachets), twin bedroom which is curtained off from the lounge/kit area, outside bathroom (with bath, very good overbath shower, loo and sink and rack to dry swimsuits on (plenty of plants and wildlife as well!), lounge/hall area with small table and two chairs plus a balcony with small table and two chairs. Upstairs is just a double bedroom (four poster with mostiquo net) - note: no mostiquo nets downstairs, but our daughter immune to them so unsure if they were a problem.Property built on hill, so everyone feels very secluded. Breakfast was a difficult choice - everything but the cereal was very very good. Choice of noodles or rice or full cooked or cereal all served with fruit/fruit juice + tea/coffee - milk not like English milk - but we stuck to the excellent juices instead.Bring US$ to pay the bill as the exchange rate to Ind Rp awful - GB拢 even worse. Still very cheap.Do not come here with wild run about toddler, as many stairs and no handrails and sheer drops.

<Content>Not suitable for families with small children We stayed in this hotel with our toddler and were a little disappointed. The hotel is not what it seems from the web-site. The scenery is nice and the surrounding jungle is beautiful. But Ubud is quite a distance away. Pool and Spa close very early so there was not much to do for us when our toddler was asleep in the evening. The staff seems a little annoyed by the guests. The rooms are fairly dark.It might be a good place for singles and young couples without children who want to enjoy some quiet. But with children I wouldnt go there. The walkways and paths are much to steep and not any good for play.

<Content>Bali Spirit will keep your spirits high We selected the Bali Spirit for our first visit to Bali based on reviews in professional guidebooks, balancing an authentic experience with a reasonable price. The Bali Spirit fit the bill, with a beautiful and atmospheric location and very comfortable accomodations.Although the hotel is a ways out of town, that is actually an advantage. The jungle is thick and the hotel located on a river gorge. We were in Room 107, the closest to the river, an ideal location. The views through the windows of the two-level villa were wonderful, with local residents often washing clothes and bathing in the river. We were surprised to find a TV and DVD player, since we had read otherwise. The outside bathroom is a nice touch. Our two teenagers were quite happy there and slept like logs. Our only complaints about the villa are that it did not have the most comfortable lounge chairs nor adequate lighting for reading.The pool is very nice, and the restaurant good enough. A driver was always available to take us into town as needed, and, as was the case everywhere else in Bali, the staff were very kind and thoughtful.

<Content>Over-rated, the odour of the mosquito nets disgusting! Our third hotel on a recent tour of Bali. We loved Ubud, but in hindsight wish we had booked a different hotel.Location - it's quite a way out of town. There is a free shuttle bus, but it doesn't run that frequently. We ended up paying for private shuttles quite often - they weren't that dear. The driver who took us all the way back to the airport (via a long stop at the Ikat handweave centre in Gianyar) was particularly helpful. You can walk into town through the monkey forest, but it's quite a long walk in the heat. The resort is on a hillside - quite a lot of stairs and steep paths.Room - our main complaint was the smell. We've travelled a lot in the tropics, we know things get steamy and damp. But there was absolutely no excuse for the mildew odour from both bed linens and the mosquito net - huge incense sticks, sprays and hairdryers failed to shift it!Restaurant - don't! Eat somewhere wonderful in town. Bored waitresses, over-priced lowest-common-denominator food.Spa - didn't try it.

<Content>Definately Book It! Fantastic place to stay. We went to bali as part of our honeymoon. Having spent three nights in Hong Kong previous to our arrival, the Bali Spirit seemed like a world away from all things commercial. The hotel is set in the middle of a jungle and feels like it is meant to be there. It is a real oasis of calm and nature. We had our own little bungalow in the grounds which i would really recommend if you go. Great pool which is never busy and great service from all staff.The walk through the neighbouring monkey forest is very exciting especially if you are carrying bananas. Ubud is fantastic if you love shopping for bargain crafts and eating out. A free hotel bus runs regularly in and out though it's a nice walk in day time.The food in the hotel is nice but head into to town for more choice. The spa treatments are a real bargain but beware of the volcano massage....boy it is HOT! Loved our four nights there, a great location for white water rafting and a visit to the island volcano and hot springs. Hope you enjoy!

<Content>beautiful hotel, fantastic staff We stayed for five nights in the Spirit hotel, having booked it through Asia Rooms, for only 拢35 a night for the Legong Suite. The room was spacious and comfortable-the bathroom was fairly basic, but considering what we paid this was fine. The grounds of the hotel were stunning, particulalry around the pool area which was lovely and relaxing. The staff and management at the hotel were fantastic and couldn't be anymore polite and helpful, but unobstrusive.A minibus service is provided into the centre of Ubud so you can shop during the day or eat out at night, and we arranged a trip through the hotel, which was good value.We stayed in this hotel as part of our honeymoon and i would well recommend it for a relaxing stop off.

<Content>Beautiful location and rooms It was my first time in Bali and this hotel was a welcome part of the trip. My wife and I stayed there for six nights and we would stay there again.The property is beautiful, it was a treat just to walk down for the breakfast and to the pool each day. The room we had was also very attractive. The place was very quiet and relaxing. They have a handy shuttle into the main area of Ubud.  My wife also had a very good massage there, though this service can be had anywhere in town also. One bit of advice there is that the tours of the area they list in their services when you get there cost about twice as much as you can arrange at the main tourism office in downtown Bali, and both tours go to exactly the same places. The other extras also seemed more expensive on an island where you can bargain down the price of just about anything. But I think the difference in tour costs comes from the fact they would set up your own driver for you.

<Content>Tranquility in the Jungle The drive from the airport to Ubud through the streets of Denpasar may make you wonder if you've really arrived in a magical island. But soon you are clear of the urban sprawl and passing stone carving and carpentry workshops, compounds of the local villages and rice padis. Bali Spirit Hotel is beautifully perched on a steep hillside above a river. We had a River Villa with a 2 single bed bedroom alcove off the small lounge and a large double bed upstairs. The villa was beautifully finished in local stone and wood, with a lovely private open air shower/bathroom. The pool was a short walk through the well maintained gardens, with an adequate no. of loungers and a nice swim up bar, to partake of a Bintang beer in the late afternoon sun. There is a 3 or 4 times daily free mini bus run into Ubud, but its a really pleasant 15m walk from the hotel to the south end of the main street, Jalan Monkey Forest. The restaurant is nice but quiet as most guests head for the town to eat in the evening. Staff helpful and friendly. We would go back in a moment. Price for villa $99 night plus 21% tax, incl breakfast. Superb value for money.

<Content>Magic place After spending a few nights at the Hard Rock Hotel, it was a delight to go to the Bali Spirit. In this hotel it really feels like Bali!Ok.. it is not a mega 5 star hotel chain with marble and everything, but this hotel is a magical jungle. The rooms are nice and comfy. We booked a Emerald room and were very satisfied. It has a lovely balcony overlooking the white water river and the forest. Everything is so peacefull and quiet. It has a free shuttle bus to go into town even if it's really doable on foot. Morning breakfast by the river is great. The pool is fresh from the spring water. Loved it!!!

<Content>OK, but not great My family of three spent 11 nights here. Ubud is a wonderful area to explore, but we felt the hotel didn't live up to its image on the website. First, we'd reserved the River Villa as it is described on the website as having a kitchen and we wanted to be able to cook. There was no cooking facility at all--just a double sink, a mini-fridge and an electric kettle, which are also available in the cheaper Emerald Rooms. The River Villa was dark and mildewy and we moved to an Emerald Room after just one night. The Emerald Room was much brighter and better, although to be honest, humidity was still a bit of an issue. If you have allergies, take some medication along to be comfortable. In all fairness, humidity/mold problems are found to some degree elsewhere in Bali, even in the five-star hotels. We actually tried to find another hotel in the Ubud area after just a few days but everything was booked. There were some nicer and cheaper accomodations nearby. Second, if you are travelling with a small child, please note that the balconies on the upstairs rooms are low and some have big gaps in between the posts. Also, the hotel is located on a hillside near a river, so you have to keep a close eye on the kids and deal with mosquitoes. On the positive side, the staff are very helpful and friendly, and the grounds are beautiful. The free shuttle into Ubud was very useful. We found plenty to keep us busy during our time in Ubud. Room service is the same price as eating in the restaurant.

<Content>Absolutely Gorgeous, Relaxing and Deliciously Sweet Don't book over the phone. Instead, book your stay through the internet and you will get an online discount. Make sure to confirm your stay 48 hours prior to your arrival, or you may not get the room you requested. My husband and I stayed in this absolutely gorgeous resort for less than $60USD/night. This place is just beautiful. The staff is so friendly and warm, and not in-your-face at all. They have a free shuttle service that will take you back and forth into Ubud town, about every 20 minutes or so, from morning through the evening. Totally worth it. Only recommendation - do not use the Hotel Drivers for personal day trips. Too expensive. Instead, bargain with someone that you find and trust. Or, just use our driver, Wayan. He was wonderful - on time, reliable, and responsible, and we were referred to him by several friends who use him all the time they're in Bali. You can reach him at: 011-62-81-239-92237. He charged us $30USD/full day of travel back/forth/across the island. Plus, we tipped him $5/day, for which he was immensely grateful. Use my name, if you like: Aria, as a referral. You will love Bali. Have fun!

<Content>Great spot, Room and Staff but Beds are torture Very convenient spot in Ubud a short walk from the Monkey Forest on your way to town. The resort has expansive grouynds with a truly in the jungle feel about it. This is both great and at times a bit dark and wet feeling. The resort is adjacent to the river and set high along its banks. Overall the location and Resort works very well.The only thing against it and its a bit of a deal breaker is that the beds are beyond extremely firm bordering on some type of torture. Couldnt handle the beds and had to cut our stay here short. Ubud has many great restaurants, warung and bars and bars and there is plenty to see and do. The Spirit Hotel was nice but I would have to say I would go to Ubud again but just not to the Sprirt Hotel.

<Content>good value We recently stayed at the Bali Spirit, after seeing good reviews at Trip Advisor. It's in a lovely location (the river flows through) and local people come down to bathe, fish, do their washing, and the children come down to play. Rooms were big and cool. Restaurant nothing special, but location overlooking the river is great. Good walk into Ubud through Monkey Forest. Pool and pool bar we had to ourselves most days! Only hiccup, the regular pickup bus, was often early from Ubud.

<Content>Tropical Hideaway We chose this hotel to spend a few days at because of the location - it's just within walking distance of Ubud centre but also offers a free shuttle bus to and from the centre, which was invaluable!The hotel itself was nice, nestled amongst rainforest. We stayed in one of the bigger rooms, which was decorated in a very traditional balinese style and very beautiful, with a lovely lit balcony overlooking the valley.Swimming pool was lovely, and the restaurant did great food at very reasonable prices. Wouldn't be suitable for business use though, there was an internet service but no printer.The only real criticism I have of this hotel is that, compared to other hotels we stayed at in this price range, the facilities and quality of the room were not as good.

<Content>Magic Hidaway We stayed at Bali Sprit for 3 nights in the Emerald Room. The room was lovely and clean, the outdoor bathroom and the private outdoor shower is absolute bliss and very relaxing. This room also have a patio that has a day bed and small table and chairs for you to sit out in nature and read a book and unwind. The hotel grounds are immaculate; they have a great sized pool that gets a lot of sun and a TV hut with a DVD player provided so you can watch all those DVD's you purchase in Bali! The hotel restaurant has delicious food for a very reasonable price, and the view of the river from the restaurant is stunning. Whilst this hotel isn't right in the middle of Ubud, they have a regular shuttle bus that drops you off and picks you up on one of the main streets. I would definitely recommend Bali Spirit as it is excellent value for money, I have previously stayed at a higher end (and way more expensive) Hotel and Spa in Ubud and it just doesn't compare to the value you get at Bali Spirit.

<Content>Fantastic surroundings Bali Spirit is a great place to stay. The grounds are lush  tropical, well maintained making for a peaceful environment to stay. Restaurant  pool were excellent (cheaper in town of course). It's about 2km out of town, but has a good shuttle service to the centre of Ubud. We walked in most days as it was a pleasant walk through the village  monkey forest (free entry through the back entrance) to town. Service was good as was the breakfast. Only complaint was distant traffic noise from a road nearby(not too bad though). Would definitley recommend!

<Content>Musty, moldy and dark (but friendly staff!) We stayed in everything from mosquito-filled bungalows with no hot water to a luxury beach resort during our time in Bali. We absolutely loved eveywhere EXCEPT Bali Spirit. It was dark and dingy and smelled awful! We had to leave after only one night. In that short time, the clothes I put in the closet turned damp and smelled like mildew. The bedspread was damp to the touch. The pillows were the worst of all, though. They smelled so bad that my husband and I couldn't use them. Good thing we don't have asthma. I even walked outside in the pitch-black darkness in the middle of the night just to get some fresh air. And the bathroom is dark and depressing. We love outdoor showers, but this one was just plain depressing. I hate to write a bad review, because the staff was SO FRIENDLY. They did their best to help us. They offered to move us to a room on the second floor, but it had the same problem--though not quite as bad. There was a strange sink in the room too. It was old and no longer hooked up to anything. Weird. The breakfast was not great. The grounds are GORGEOUS, but the location is not good. Sure, I like privacy and peacefulness, but that can be found in Ubud as well. You don't have to be in a river valley to experience Balinese nature. It's everywhere. The shuttle was not convenient at all. We felt trapped in our dungeonous dwelling. So sorry for the bad news. The good news is that we moved to a $30 a night room that was amazingly beautiful. The grounds were gorgeous and our view was heart-stopping. Much better hotels can be found for MUCH LESS MONEY. I promise.
