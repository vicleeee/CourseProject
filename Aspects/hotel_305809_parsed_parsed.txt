<Content>Worse hotel EVER!!! Not even a hotel, should call it a MOTEL!! We also booked this hotel through travel agent in Sydney and was told this is a good place to stay. But when I arrived at this hotel back in March 08, my kids and I was shocked, this can't be a 3 star hotel, I have checked through their website and there was not much information!! First of all, they showed us this room in level 7 that took about 6 steps from the lift and the room smelt [their explanation was because of the renovation then they should fix this problem before they open their business!!], the wall paper was dark, wet and stained, the room was also very small and the most worrisome problem is that there was another wooden door that was broken to the room next door! The toilet and shower door was broken too!! That is unbelievable! You could practically kick the door and it would open! After my complaint, they took me up to level 12 to another room, that room is a little bit better but still have the same problems. I ended up not even staying there and went to my family's place and went back there 3 days later to pick up my luggages and the worse thing was that all my clothes had absorbed the smell and I had to take all my clothes to dry clean!!! It was the worse experience that I even had. I definitely will not go there again or recommend anyone either.

<Content>Dirty and stuffy hotel We booked a hotel through the travel agent and she assured us that this hotel is a very nice hotel with a very good location. Lo and behold! it is a dump. the bathtub was so dirty and the room was so stuffy.we were shortchanged, so i called our travel agent by overseas to complain. with the assistance of her travel agent partner there, we were transferred a a better hotel in the area.never, ever set foot in this dump unless you want to ruin your vacation.

<Content>Grotty hotel  We booked the Imperial hotel in Hong Kong online using elong.com which specialises in hotels in Asia and was recommended by one of their staff so we were confident it would be a good quality hotel - especially as it cost $1200 HKD per night. How wrong we were!We realised something was wrong when we walked through the door in reception mid Oct 2008 which was filled with suitcases across the floor and people everywhere. The room we were given in the Imperial hotel was 1712 located on the top floor. The small lift did work, but we were surprised when the doors opened to view a narrow hallway carpet covered in a dust sheet and a laundry trolley in the way. Our room was at the very end of a dimly lit corridor.On opening the door to the room the smell of damp hit home, along with the noise of an air-conditioning unit and a dehumidifier. The windows were locked shut so there was no way to vent this foul smell. To add to injury there was a hole in the wall.The room itself was fairly small though the bed was of reasonable size and the bathroom was compact with a bath, shower and WC which were clean but certainly not worth $1200 HKD ($154 USD or æ‹¢90 GBP) per night.We decided to go for a walk to discuss options before returning, collecting our bags and leaving the Imperial Hotel. Total time from check-in to check-out being approx two hours. In view of this we asked for our money back, but the manager refused point-blank to return any money because we had booked the hotel online. The fact the service received and quality of room were sub-standard seemed to have been missed.My recommendation to any visitors to Hong Kong. The Imperial Hotel in Hong Kong is one hotel that should be avoided at all costs - there are plenty other hotels in Hong Kong at a similar price range offering far better facilities.Though I was forced to sign 'under duress' the credit card slip before leaving the Imperial Hotel in Hong Kong, though I will now be contacting my credit card company to demand a full refund.Basil Fawlty would have been proud of the totally crap service provided by the Imperial Hotel  staff. The word 'Imperial' being somewhat misleading, well apart from their service charge.My Recommendation - AVOID THE IMPERIAL HOTEL IN HONG KONG AT ALL COST!

<Content>I would rather sleep in the gutter outside I didn't stay here by choice. I was on a tour. The lobby seemed like an average 3 star hotel but everything else was worse than terrible. The hallways smelt musty, the room smelt even more musty, the room was so tiny, the bathroom was filthy and old, there was mold on the walls and curtains. The sheets had stains on them, therefore i couldnt bring myself to lye on the bed. It was so bad i had to walk the streets until the morning. Lucky we only had to stay here 1 night. The smell and the look of this place makes me think of death. I will never forget this hotel. It ruined my trip in Hong Kong.

<Content>Don't stay here This hotel has a great location and great price but ..... the first room I was allocated had condensation running down the walls. It was very damp. I asked to be moved and the second room was better but very cold - there was no heating (middle of winter) and I slept in my clothes.

<Content>Hotel condition is horrible We were booked here for 2 nights. Staff was friendly and it looked like the cleaning staff tried to clean the room, but this place looks 40 years old. The mold was so bad I had to find another hotel for the second night of our stay. When the elevator door opened I thought I was in some sort of abandoned warehouse. But it was the hallway.For not much more money you can do a lot better in the same area.

<Content>Needs vastly improving! We stayed for 2 nights in October and after a long flight from the UK we were expecting something far more decent, particulalrly as the agent recommended it to us! The room was awful, small, dirty and dingy. I was too tired to complain which is what I think they must rely on plus it was only for 2 nights. It really is rundown and seedy especially on the floor we were located, I have a feeling other floors were of a better quality. Location is great but I wouldn't stay there again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone it really is dreadful and believe me I've stayed in some rotten places!

<Content>A Great Disappointment Avoid this hotel at all cost. Although it was located strategically (in shopping belt and next to train station), its room was tiny and cluttered with furniture, damp, dark and smelly. Walls had stains on them and the air-cond vent was old and dusty. Very noisy as well because of thin walls and poor sound-proofing, so I could hear my neighbours talking, sneezing.... And the wooden bathroom door was rotting. Worst hotel I have stayed in in Kowloon. Never again!CharlesSINGAPORE

<Content>rip off imperial Probably the most disgusting hotel I have ever stayed in. I was charged HK$1600 for one nights stay in Nov. The smell in the room was awful (damp)and I did not sleep under the covers of the bed as I felt it was not that clean. Luckily I was able to book the Harbour Plaza for my remaining two night stay in Hong Kong. I would not recommend the Imperial hotel to anyone. Would actualy tell anyone I KNEW GOING TO HONG KONG TO STAY CLEAR OF IT. UTTERLY DISGUSTING HOTEL.

<Content>Great Location, On Nathan Road!!! Hotel had a great location, right on Nathan Road and close to MTR Train system (transport was amazing very good and easy) We had dripping problems with our air condition unit, lets just say if my suit case didn't have a hard cover case all of my belongings would have been soaked with water. Staff were very good as soon as we complained about it they moved us straight away to a different room. Iwould only stay here again if i was desperate.

<Content>Budget Property with Location Advantage stayed at this hotel from 1 - 6 nov on 3 floor. Property has just been refurbished. Got an free upgrade from DBL to Trpl room. The room was decent. But first night we had to fight with Bed Bugs. The location is an advantage in TST, bang on Nathan Road. Very next door is the famous Chungking Mansions. The crowd as night is not recommended for young child. Lot of fake watch agents move arnd. TST MTR is just opp or i think just below the hotel. Indian food was not a problem plenty of options arnd and in Chungking Mansions also. The hotel is ok, but since location is advantage the price was ok. Most of the locations like promenade, star ferry, science museum are within walking distance of 5 - 10 mins. Not really recommended for small families with young children. Otherwise, this hotel can be considered.

<Content>Well satisfied from Essex Booked Imperial THEN read reviews so was expecting the worse, BUT, was pleasantly surprised. Flashy with chandeliers it aint. However, the staff were lovely, the room was exceptionally clean, spaghetti house and Murphy's pub were a godsend after a hard day trawling the sites and were excellent.There was a musty smell in the corridors but with the humidity outside it could be expected and it was not in the room. Great value for money and I would definitely stay again.

<Content>The most horrifying stay of my life My husband and I treated guests to a Hong Kong trip and booked them at the Imperial Hotel. We could not be more embarassed when we arrived at the place. Upon entering the lobby and checking in, there was a bell boy loitering the area. He just looked at us with our suitcases, and did not even offer to assist us to our rooms. That's just the start.When we got to the 17th floor where our room was located, I was instantly dismayed to see that there were several rooms in the same floor which were under construction. There was no attempt to cover these up, as the rubble and construction mess was in plain view. Also, there was a garbage bag in the middle of the hallway. When we entered our room, we found that it was tiny. The bathroom was even tinier. One would have to be really skinny to use the toilet because there is not much space between the wall and the bathtub, where the toilet is located.The glasses provided in the bathroom were smudgy, as if they were not washed since the last occupant left.The bed cover was old and caused us to itch. When we removed the bed cover, the blanket was worn out and looked even more uncomfortable. Worst, when we removed the blanket, we found that the bedsheet had a stain which looked like blood.The towels were no better. Two out of three towels provided had stains. Bathroom amenities were terrible. The hotel was very stingy with shampoo, which was contained in sachets. This is the only hotel I've been to where the shampoo is provided in sachets. The toothpaste tasted like putty and did not produce foam. The bristles of the toothbrush came loose in my mouth as I was using it.Cleanliness is not a priority in Imperial Hotel. When the cleaning lady came to our room, she only changed the sheets (thank God!) and made up the bed, and nothing much else. She failed to clean a big mud spot in the middle of the bathroom which was impossible to miss.Forget about sleeping in, too, as you will be disturbed by staff who do not care much for peace and quiet. The cleaning lady knocked on our door asking if she could clean. When I replied Not yet, she came back two times more in a span of five minutes. On the day we were leaving, our 35 guests, plus luggage, were in the lobby waiting for the shuttle. The moment the shuttle came, the manager asked my husband if the group could leave already. My husband found this completely rude, and told the manager that if our group had to go, he would have to ask the other guests loitering in the lobby to leave too. It was only then that the manager backed off.We actually had arranged to stay for one more night at Imperial Hotel after our guests left. However, the never-ending horrors in this hotel led us to look for a room for our remaining night in another hotel. Guess what -- a room in Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel cost only HKD100 more than booking an extra night in Imperial! Needless to say, we were out of there in a flash.After our stay in Imperial, Marco Polo Hong Kong hotel was heaven. But then again, it isn't difficult for most hotels to top the nightmare that is Imperial Hotel.

<Content>What a rip off!! My husband and I were coming in to Hong Kong for an exhibition. As we could not get a single room in any hotel, we finally ended up with the one room available at, The Imperial'.I read the reviews and thought, how could a 'three star' hotel be that bad. Well, after staying there for five days, all I can say is that the three star rating has to be only for the hotels location. Location: Excellent: You can walk down the entire stretch and do your shopping. There are seven elevens as well as the Sheraton on one side and the Holiday Inn on the other. The mrt station is just opposite the hotel. Brilliant location.Food: There is none! No room service or restaurant. No breakfast! You have to go out for anything to eat or drink. You can make packet tea or coffee but it is awful.Room: Smelly, damp and hardly any lights. I think they keep the room lights dim so you miss seeing the dirt and everything else. Bathroom: Tiny. But the shower was good. Hot water and basic toiletries.Reception: They hardly smile or speak english. They will write down things for you and help with directions. Overall, only stay here if you don't get a room some where else, or you are going to be out all day anyway. Being Indian, we paid enough for one night here, that would have gotten us a night at the 'Taj' a five star hotel chain from India. Price: Ridiculously expensive for this place.Hope this helps.

<Content>Ayayay!!!! Oh it wasn't nice!!! It was tatty and spooky especially during nighttime. There was a time that somebody knocked at the door at midnight and though I opened it quick enough there was nobody, no noise of running or any giggling or any trace at all. The rooms were not uniform although they were of the same category. It was like built on recycled scrap material. The bed was not fluffy at all. The TV only had news and channel v in English. Especially that time I was experiencing sinusitis and all those nasal dilemmas, I cant have the air-con on when I'm sleeping so my sister had to endure no air-con with me. When we turned it on at the mildest setting it was still too cold and when you turn it off the room smells old and rotten. It's never supposed r to smell like that.  The stuff are old and creepy, as in the cabinets have dust bunnies, some areas have spots on them. There was no doorbell. and when we got there there was not enough space to move around and we would always have to wait for each other before we could navigate (we=*sister) or sometimes bump into each other. It was so really really small, from the lobby to the room, and people just smoke around in the lobby, and the concierge was the only thing nice and the location. I, never ever, not in a million years, ever want to stay at that hotel again.

<Content>what to expect?? Location on Nathan Road is perfect. Everything was and is working. Service ok so what else to expect??The finishing touch. In Asia you will find many new buildings. Ready and now we are going to make money. Maintenance why?? we make money.Imperial hotel is one of those buldings. Everything is working but nobody is looking after cracking doors and paint. Old smelly carpets and maybe some guests are interested in having a breakfast but why to invest more money if everything is running well.If the management of the Imperial Hotel wishes to have repeat business instaed of one time staying guests they will have to invest in renovatng the place.For some extra dollars they have many good looking neighbours

<Content>A small-roomed, smelly last resort First of all, if you visit this hotel's website and look around you'll find pictures of the lobby and one of the rooms. I'd say that the lobby picture isn't that deceiving, if you can accept that what you see in the picture is all there is to the place, save for a tiny niche containing a circle of couches and a table. There is a toilet, but this is actually a shared toilet with the adjoining restaurant, and requires a walk through an incredibly shoddy and depressing hallway.The elevators up the hotel are inconveniently shaped and are cramped like none I have been in before and there are no staff to help you bring your luggage up (although in my experience there were almost no staff to help you do anything). The lift stopped at the 16th floor and when the doors opened my first thought was Basil Fawlty, the hallway was stark white with imitation foam as a ceiling, some of which was sagging for God's sake.Since I was travelling with a small group at peak season, we split in to pairs and had adjacent rooms at the rear corners of the hotel. Me and my partner opened the door with a sense of foreboding, and when it swung open I felt like I was going to laugh at how ridiculously bad the room was and break down crying about the fact I was staying in it.I walked over to my friends' room and it appeared to be even worse, there was a rough hole in the bedside table and the ceiling was cracked concrete. I walked to the curtains and threw them open to be met by two large panes of immovable, frosted glass. My disappointment increased when I ran back to my room to inspect the area behind the curtains to find one frosted pane, and one normal one giving my a stunning city-scape view: towers of dejectedly browning slum-like buildings.The rooms were ludicrously small (I'd guess 2.5m by 3m), barely fitting two beds, a desk, a poorly positioned closet, a mirror, a TV, a fluorescent light and two wall-mounted lamps. Those lights and lamps were the one of two sources of light and they failed at being those very things. That was accompanied by the fact that the only other source was sunlight from the windows, and that light requires you to view that horrid sight of deteriorating buildings. The beds were insanely uncomfortable, causing me to change positions every few minutes (even when I was sitting on it) and making me have a back ache in the morning.The room constantly stank of a dank stench similar to that of a basement, only the room also had carpet to absorb it. We bought a can of disinfectant spray to combat it, but it took three rounds of spraying to make it bearable. The TV had an average-to-poor amount of reception, and very limited channels, although it was edging on alright.The bathroom is a roughly 1.5m by 2.5m area with a small bath, a toilet and a basin with nothing to hide the grimy pipes below it. To be fair it stank a lot less than the actual room and I could bear to be in it for a fair length of time. That's it on the rooms, you can make the judgement on whether you like them or not, but I for one severely disliked them.I had a few normal run-ins with the staff, two with the reception (which was okay) and two with doormen/informative standing people. The first was alright, and he helped us make it to the ferry and to Hong Kong island, and the second helped us call a taxi to another ferry terminal that we would take to leave to another destination. The latter sped off with our luggage, forcing one of us to run to keep him in sight just in case he ran off for good, and he managed to get four of us and oh so many pieces of luggage jammed into the car. Although he could've done worse, this was less than desirable.The location of the hotel just gives you access to shops plastered with flashy neon signs, most saying 'Sony', and many people trying to force you into their shops to buy something, though the only reason you would would be so you could just go away and be left alone. The hotel gets points for being near the MTR station but when it comes to location that's all I can give it that's positive.All in all, stay away from the Imperial Hotel in Hong Kong unless it's the absolute last option you have to be able to stay in Hong Kong territory, and even then, you may consider just not going in order to avoid this atrocity, because if you befall the same fate I did, your opinion of Hong Kong will become very low, and the best time you'll have with the hotel is the time you check out.

<Content>stay away!!! Greasy, sleazy, stay away! On rip-off street Nathan Road, amidst the Camera-stores with their well-earned reputation of no service - high price lays the 'Imperial hotel. Three stars - well, one would be more appropriate - this hotel offers microscopic, run down rooms (even for HK standards) with bathrooms not worth the name (because who would ever take a bath there??) and dirty carpets and walls. The whole hotel is so run-down in fact that it badly needs a renovation since at least 20 years. The prices are ridiculously high (we paid 1240 HK$ in december 2007, room booked through Asia travel) for this location, the rooms not worth half this price. Stay away and look for another hotel, with clean rooms and most of the time a better rate. G.S -Germany

<Content>Most uninviting We moved from a very good 3 star as it was full to this awful hotel of the same star rating. While the lobby may be new it is uninviting, but when you get to the different floors it is awful...the smell of dampness and the grubbiness of the corridors is very uninviting. I dreaded what to expect in the bedroom. However, our room was not as bad as the corridors. HOwever, there were parts of the room where the paint was peeling away and the bathroom was very basic...more like a 1 star. I asked to see other rooms with a view to moving...and the smell of urine in one of them was just awful. This irregularity in the star ratings is very misleading and hotels should give a full refund if guests have a genuine reason to move property.

<Content>stark room, hard beds, crooked staff We got a good deal from a travel agent that recommended this hotel to us as a 4 star hotel. This hotel could barely rate a two star experience in my opinion.When we checked in I already had a bad feeling. The lobby is a small crowded hallway leading up to the elevators, which were probably the smallest elevators I have ever been in. Stepping out from the elevators into the skinny hallway didn't raise my expectations either. The hallway walls were bare. We entered our room and we were greeted with more of the same.The room was barely furnished with two beds, a cabinet, TV, and a refrigerator (which didn't seem to work). I turned on the TV and found out that the remote didn't work. (dead batteries?) There was one window in the room and it was frosted so you couldn't see out. (I felt like I didn't want to see what was on the other side anyway)The air conditioning was on full blast and even after turning it off the room was freezing. (even in the morning) The room also smelled strongly of an antiseptic odor.The bathroom didn't have any power outlets. The bathtub was really skinny and practically a hazard while taking a shower. There were wires connecting all the metal fixtures in the bathroom, for safety purposes. (weird)I sat down on the bed and it was like sitting on a desk. I've felt more comfortable sleeping on the ground outdoors than in this bed. The pillows were pretty sad too.They had wireless internet for 120 HKD for 24 hours, which I tried and was able to use. They charged us 5 HKD for local calls too, which surprised my girlfriend.After one night, we had enough so the next day we packed up early and checked out. We had paid in advance through the travel agent so we asked the hotel to refund the second night. (we had reserved two) The staff gave us the runaround. At first my girlfriend discussed the issue with them in cantonese. The agent at the hotel (who turned out to be the assistant manager !) claimed that the hotel wasn't in possession of the payment and was under a contractual obligation to charge for two nights. (The travel agent denied this) He also stated that he didn't want to refund the money to the travel agent because there would be no guarantees that the travel agent would refund the money to you. My girlfriend continued to talk to him and the agent while I went to check us into another hotel. When I finally came back 30-40 minutes later they were still going back and forth. We left to take our luggage to the other hotel.When we returned to the hotel I spoke to the same agent (in english). I explained to him that if he billed us for the night we didn't stay that I would call the hong kong tourist hotline and file a complaint. He eventually capitulated.We later found out that the hotel was in fact already in possession of the payment. After the hotel refunded the money to travel agent the agent returned the money to us nearly immediately.I tried to come up with some good things about this place and about the best I could come up with were: no bugs that we saw, there was hot water, and it seemed clean. (nothing to get dirty!)

<Content>Imperial - average,. don't expect more I agree with all the reviews. The bedroom, the toilet, the carpet stink. Worst of all, the front-desk people do not know much English. Most of the time, I had to write my messages or exaggerate my gestures. I think they put on a snob front just so you would not ask for more and force them to speak in more English. Hongkong Chinese are some of the worst people i have encountered in Asia. In Bangkok and Manila, even if the facilities stink, the people are warm and hospitable. Singaporeans are ok too

<Content>Not recommendable! We stayed for three nights. Our room was surely not as nice as the one that is displayed in the internet. No reading lamps, much smaller and no light coming inside, because we faced the wall of a neighboring building.The matrasses and the bathroom were OK (room 1006) and if you are a single and just use it for sleeping it might serve your purpose, but if you are tired from walking through the city, you don't want to go back there, because it's no place to relax and feel comfortable. The TV reception was very poor, too.I agree with other reviewers about the unfriendly reception staff, although that's the thing you can cope with the easiest.Why I only rate it with one star is the cost performance ratio. It is far too expensive for what you get. I travelled through SE Asia and I'd say that for the same category you might pay 20USD (if ever) in Thailand, Malaysia or whatsoever. In Vietnam I had mere luxury for 15USD, but for the Imperial we paid 200 USD per night for a decent hole. Stay away!

<Content>Extreme Yuckiness Here's the lowdown on this hotel. We stayed there in 2004 and to this day I remember the awful time we had in it. We were stationed in the second floor which reeked of cigarette smoke, had worn out carpets and a toilette that didnt even flush well. What made the experience worst even was the discourteous staff, a bellhop that stayed by the door of our hotel room and kept saying thank you in broken English with his hand outstretched demanding! for about an entire minute or so that he be tipped. Fazed by such bad attitude we refused to tip him and days after before check out the room was checked by some none-english speaking attendant who called the FO and upon check out the FO Officer said, you stole a towel from your room. We are charging you for it. We are well travelled and have never experienced such a merde-hole. NEVER will we recommend this hotel.

<Content>Not worth it!!! (from an Asian tourist) Stayed here for 3 nites and the room was gosh...too small and smelly (cigar smoke). The room you see on internet is definitely not the nice room you will have. The front-desk people are very unfriendly and you never see them smile at all....poker faces! The price for the room is very high compared to what you will get from service. Bad quality curtains and mattresses. Not recommendable though the location is quite nice. Stay on other hotels!

<Content>A dump. Stayed here as a last resort, because other well located hotels in Hong Kong for less than HKD1300 were booked out. We paid HKD900 which was WAY too much for a small room with a frosted glass window, sagging matresses on the beds, musty smell, tiny bathroom, dim lighting, low ceilings, surly staff and arctic A/C which was either on or off, no thermostat to control it. DON'T STAY HERE!!!! You may as well stay next doo in Chongking Mansions for a quarter of the price and similar quality.

<Content>Adequate - No Frills First and foremost, the location is excellent! Situated along Nathan Road (Holiday Inn Golden Mile, Sheraton, Kowloon  Hyatt hotels are either next to or across the street). I traveled in a party of four people. We reserved two rooms, each had a double bed and a twin bed. The rooms are VERY small with little room to maneuver. We place out baggage on the extra twin bed. Both rooms were in the front of the building, overlooking Nathan Road. Because of the size of the room, just inches separate the bed from the window, thus you can hear the traffic. Needless to say the rooms are not soundproof. The rooms are basic and clean. The housekeeping staff is very pleasant which makes up for the front desk staff, whom lack personality and charm. Although the prices are lower than other hotels in the vicinity, you get what you pay for - no frills.

<Content>Wish I would have stayed somewhere else. I stayed here a few years ago and I have to say that I certainly hope they have improved on ALOT of things about this hotel. First, the lobby is small and uninviting. The fixtures are old and need a good remodeling. This is the same for the rooms themselves. They are small and very bland. Don't expect any frills at this hotel. We were a group of 5 people but requested adjoining rooms. We had requested a roll away and because of the small size of the room, our only spot to put it was right in front of the adjoining room door. Generally I'm not too worried about leaving used cups or food around in a hotel room. I suggest that YOU be worried about leaving food out in this hotel. I had a soda and left the empty glass on the counter. The next morning there was a very large cockroach stuck in there. I was very tempted to bring this down to the front desk but I figured we were out of there that day.At check-out, I was charged for pay-tv that I didn't even watch. I had told them that but the management took out a book with all the times we supposedly had the television on with the pay-tv on. Though we were out shopping and sightseeing, I was forced to pay about $50 USD before I was allowed to leave. Trust me, there is no way I would have wanted to spend time watching any type of pay-tv in that hotel.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless changes have been made. I think you can find a better deal at another hotel for the same price.
