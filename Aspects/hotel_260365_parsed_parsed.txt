<Content>Location, Location, Location I have to agree with some of the earlier reviews regarding this hotel. It has an excellent location, with a bus stop outside the door that takes you on Bus 245 to the main rail station in two stops (or it鈥檚 an interesting walk through the line of the old Berlin Wall). There is a U-Bahn stop within 50 yards 鈥?and it鈥檚 a very shallow line, so you can be on a train inside a couple of minutes 鈥?only two stops to Friedrichstrasse, with an easy walk from there to Unter Den Linden or Checkpoint Charlie. There are also two tram lines, one of which will take you right through to Alexanderplatz, that are just as close.The downside is that it is set up as a 鈥淏usiness Hotel鈥?and some of it鈥檚 charges are extreme 鈥?16 Euros for an hour on the internet, 16 Euro for breakfast, 3.5 euro for the bottle of water in your room, plus a hard sell on the in-room movies. There are ways around things 鈥?a local convenience store and 鈥淪ubway鈥?sandwich shop avoid the prices in the bar and restaurant. There is a free internet terminal in reception 鈥?but it鈥檚 in high demand. One suggestion was the use of a local T-Mobile Zone that does seem to give a decent signal to rooms 鈥?however, this isn鈥檛 all it seems, as although you can get a high apparent bandwidth, the capacity is such you get extremely poor response 鈥?unusable at times.The TV has a good selection of channels 鈥?including BBC World News and CNN.I sampled two rooms advertised as doubles 鈥?one was two twins pushed together, the other a more conventional double, but both provided two single duvets.I would certainly revisit this hotel because of the location and convenience.

<Content>Excellent Value This was a cut above a basic hotel. Small rooms, but clean and comfortable for two adults. Location was very convenient--walk to the Hauptbahnhof, walk or take a tram to Frierichstrasse and the Brandenburg Gate, convenient to a laundry where we washed clothes (a tram ride away). And the price was exceptional, lower than we would expect to pay in the U.S. In fact, we found in general that hotels in Germany were better priced than their U.S. counterparts, and definitely the least expensive places to stay in Europe.

<Content>Not bad for a business trip but where's the food? This hotel isn't too bad: I didn't have many choices as there were a number of trade fairs and other events on in Berlin at the time I needed to be there for a conference. I found the room fairly comfortable, the female staff helpful, the male staff generally arrogant and annoyed about needing to provide service, the location convenient. A few small niggles- a double room with two single beds pushed together is fine, but putting two single-bed duvets on it does not a comfy night's sleep make- I tried a number of configurations and none of them really worked. On the other hand, I've never experienced such fluffy comfy pillows. They offer very expensive wifi access in your room- but I found a strong connection to T-mobile from my room that saved me a lot of money. The thing I couldn't get was: where's the food? You arrive late and want something to eat- if you know what to ask for, you can go for a 10-minute walk to a supermarket- but there's no kettle or mugs to make a hot drink, no room service, no minibar- nothing but a very expensive bottle of water. There is a restaurant and a cafe/bar downstairs, but these are not really comfy, they are a bit dressy and expensive; when I travel for work I like to slob out in my room and work or watch TV. Otherwise- nice, and a very convenient location for Berlin's fantastic transport system- and they will sell you travel tickets at the reception desk.

<Content>Excellent for a 3 star hotel We had booked our double room well ahead of time and paid only EUR 60.00 per night, for 5 consecutive nights. We wondered if this would mean that they give us the worst room... but we got an excellent room, totally refurbished, with TV and a brand new bathroom. There was no safe in the room but they have one at the reception if need be. Also, there is a computer connected to internet that can be consulted free of charge in the hotel's hall. We did not take the breakfast option, but had breakfast every morning at Balzac's (German Starbuck), which is located 100 m from the hotel and where they serve fabulous caramel macchiatos (soy milk option was great). Another great thing was that there is an underground station next to the hotel (Zinnowitzerstr.) with a line that takes you directly to the shopping paradise of Friedrichstrasse! We will definitely stay there again on our next trip to Berlin.

<Content>Cant go wrong with MERCURE We decided on the Mercure Hotel Berlin an der Charite for its closeness to the main station as we had to leave early for our next destination. Not only this but we have also stayed with the chain before and we were very pleased with the service.The hotel was located on a main road and was close to the jewish quarter and brandenberg gate.The staff are all very helpful and most speak good english.The rooms were nice and spacious but most of all very clean. The rooms seemed to be soundproof as we could not hear people next door nor outside.We were on the 3rd floor which could be accessed via the elevators.Breakfast wasnt included in our stay and was offered at an extra charge of 15Euro per person... we opted for sleeping in followed by a coffee  cake from down the street.All in all our stay here was very good with out any complaints and i can recommend staying here to all.

<Content>They gave away my room! I'd booked this hotel because of its proximity to Berlin's main station where I was arriving late in the evening and leaving at the crack of dawn the next morning. I booked through Octopus who I regularly use. I'd pre-paid, my room was guaranteed for late arrival and I'd even stated on the booking notes what time I would be there.Having got there as planned at 9.30pm, the reception was packed with a tour party and I was told they had given away my room. No explanation and very little apology was offered but the receptionist brightly told me they had booked a room in another hotel for me, which when I asked to see it on a map turned out to be miles away, not to mention cheaper than the Charite. They said they would send me there in a cab and I could have a complimentary drink in the bar when I got there by way of compensation. Uh, no. Worse still they couldn't given me a cab back to the station the following day. Seeing as I had pre-paid and the hotel admitted they were aware I was arriving late this was shocking and I told them they would have to find me another hotel nearer to the station. Of course by that time of night everywhere was full, at least on the list of other Mercure Hotels or hotels they regularly dealt with. They'd also had full contact details for me on my booking form and could have contacted me at any time that day giving them time to find me a more suitably located hotel but had failed to do so. I had to kick up a huge fuss, which I'm not prone to doing, to get them to even try and rectify the situation. Their main response to anything was to say it wasn't their fault! Eventually they booked me into the Jolly Hotel Vivaldi (which was jolly nice), which took all of two seconds and they could have just done in the first place. Then they took half an hour to get me a cab. I finally got to check in to the Vivaldi at 11pm.I know that the Charite gets good reviews on here and I don't doubt them for a second, it was part of the reason I chose the hotel over others in the area, but their handling of the situation was very very poor and it should never have happened in the first place. Hopefully it was a one off.

<Content>Clean, quiet, convenient This was my second stay at the Mercure Hotel Berlin an der Charite, and on both occasions I've found that it met my needs and was generally good value (it was booked for me by a colleague I was visiting). As a woman travelling alone, I also appreciated the fact that I felt safe here.Location: convenient for public transport, for access to the main station (Berlin Hauptbahnhof), and for the Humboldt University of Berlin. The staff are all helpful, efficient, and speak good English and in some cases a number of other European languages. Rooms are spotlessly clean, showers are good, and beds are comfortable for one, though I agree with a previous reviewer that for two tall adults the double beds would be a little cramped. Bedroom lighting: good in comparison with many hotels where it's insufficient. Heating/cooling: when I stayed in early June, Berlin was experiencing 30 deg C temperatures, so I kept the window shut and used the air-conditioning - very effective and quiet, if not very environmentally sound. The breakfast buffet is of good quality and offers plenty of choice.Minor criticisms: 1. I would have appreciated a safety-deposit box in the room, and a kettle etc. to make hot drinks; however I appreciate that this facility is less common on mainland Europe than in the UK or US. 2. Internet access was convenient, fast and reliable, but very expensive at nearly 20 Euros for 24 hours, unless you just wanted a few minutes (0.3 Euros per minute up to 1 hour in any 24 hour period). A budget/mid-range hotel should really offer better deals than this.Otherwise, a good choice for this area of Berlin.

<Content>Acceptable Economy Hotel, Not for Everyone We stayed here for 5 nights while my husband attended a conference, but we would not stay here again.Good Bits: Very reasonable price, convenient location (almost next to U-Bahn Stop), safe neighborhood, acceptable food, adequate serviceBad Bits: The beds are not intended for 2 people, much too small. Plus, we are both tall people (about 6 feet tall) and our feet hung off the end. The bed was very lumpy and uncomfortable. Plus, the sheets  duvet are 100% polyester. Extremely scratchy and way too warm. It is also near a hospital and there were sirens all night long.If you are someone inclined towards sleep issues, DO NOT STAY HERE! I got next to no sleep on this trip and spent my days wandering about in a daze from sleep deprivation.Meanwhile, my husband slept like a log and lost no sleep whatsoever. I spent my nights wishing desperately for sleep and suppressing an overwhelming desire to poke him for being able to sleep so well!

<Content>Good standard value without frills Good standard Mercure hotel; well located within walking distance of the Mitte business and govt district and the restaurant and bar areas of Oranienburger Strasse. Very competetively priced, like most Berlin hotels. A no-frills chain product; can be recommended without second thoughts.

<Content>Great Location in Berlin This hotel is right next door to the Museum of Natural History. It is a 15 minute walk from the Hauptbahnof (main train station).Museum Island is about 15 minutes from the hotel as well the Friedrichstrasse U-bahn and S-bahn station. Both this and the Hauptbahnof let you connect to the rest of the city in no time.Room was clean and more than adequate for a short visit to the city. Great breakfast buffet selections.

<Content>Great value and great location This hotel is very comfortable, clean, quiet and centrally located. It is very reasonably priced for what it offers. Its functional modern decor should please any traveler unless he is looking for super luxury or romantic glamor. The staff speak good English and are very helpful.

<Content>Warning - sky-high fee! What an unpleasant surprise at a moderately priced hotel. I found that the internet use fee in my room was over $35 a 24-hour day! They had a computer in the lobby for those who object to the fee. It is free - you can wait in line to use it, and lean against a seat support while doing so in the public area near the bar.

<Content>Not quite as good as last time Stayed here again almost exactly a year after my last stay. The room was slightly bigger and the receptionist put me on the 7th floor right at the back, so although it was a hike to the lifts there was a great view over the rooftops and the room was quiet.However, on the 3rd morning I was rudely awoken at 7:00 by workmen tearing up the carpet, which was being relaid throughout the hotel (and by the time I left the next day, had not been relaid, making the floor look very tatty). On asking at reception, there was no explanation and in fact the receptionist seemed to have no idea that this was going on. Later that afternoon on returning to the hotel, I found that my key card had been cancelled in an effort to get me back to reception to be offered a change of room (unwanted) and a voucher for a drink (unusable in the time I had left). Not impressed; this whole situation could have been handled a lot better.

<Content>Good Location, Good Value, Clean Modern Not quite in the centre of the city, but a short walk or next-door tube stop makes getting around easy. On the edge of east berlin with some interesting archiceture in the surrounding streets.Clean modern efficient hotel. Works well. Gets on with the job of being a clean efficient hotel without some of the pointless pompousness you find in more established hotels.Room was large and clean. Bar and Restaurant modern, clean and efficient. Good value means it is recommended for all.

<Content>Excellent value! Immaculate 3 star offering allround excellent value. I paid EUR 87 per night (including a delicious and plentiful breakfast). Must be one of the best deals in Berlin!Though the hotel is not in the most hip and happening part of Berlin, it boasts very good transportation links to places that are. The Oranienburger Strasse area, Kreuzberg, Mitte and Prenzlauerberg all can be reached by U-Bahn in a couple of minutes. From Sch枚nefeld it is the S-Bahn to Friedrichstrasse, then 2 stops on the U6 in the direction of Alt-Tegel to Zinnowitzer Strasse. Hotel is literally 50 meters away. From Tegel, it's best to take a taxi (about EUR 14) as public transportation links to and from Tegel are rather bad.The hotel doesn't look very appealing from the outside but the rooms are clean, comfortable, modern and are furnished with nice accessories like an Artemide Tolomeo desk lamp. Bathroom well appointed with high quality toiletries and a walk-in shower.I would not choose this hotel for its atmosphere, facilities or location. This hotel is a great option for a business traveller or tourist who wants comfort and the basics but can do without a spa or swimming pool.

<Content>Modern, quiet hotel with friendly staff and excellent value for your money! Modern hotel with very friendly staff. Breakfast was very good. Rooms weren't big but clean, modern, practical and quiet. The bar was lively at night with hotel guests only. 80% of hotel guests were German. The hotel is a few steps away from a U-Bahn station, which makes it easily accessible. Not much night life in the vicinity but the U-Bahn runs until the wee hours of the morning.We paid 66 Euro a night for a double room with twin beds (pushed together), breakfast, a welcome drink and one Tageskarte for transportation. It was a summer special for 3 nights.We felt it was an excellent price for an excellent hotel and would stay there again.

<Content>Great location in modern hotel This hotel is nice and modern.Rooms are well appointed and clean. Great shower.Could do with having seperate beds in the twin rooms.But I understand that all Accor hotels are like this.for a three star you are missing some things like mini bar, safe, tea/coffee. But there's vending machines in the coriddor and there are shops and cafes just moments way (some open all night)Service was just okay. Rang down for an iron and had to go and get in myself and bring it back almost immediately. Reception staff were fine but lack of a manager on site the weekend I stayed meant that a lot of guest problems were never sorted out. But staff were pleasant and as helpful as they could be.Location is good. U bahn station next door takes you to Friedstrasse for connections all over Berlin.Short walk to the Oranienstrasse area for bars and restaurants.Hauptbahnfoff is 15 minutes walk and a bus there takes you to Tegel (less than half an hour). Didn't find the bargain prices that some reviewers found though.But they were fairly competitive in a city with a lot of choice of hotels.

<Content>Excellent value for money We wanted a hotel for three nights whilst we visited the Christmas markets. It was easy to find after we took a bus from Tegel airport and a single journey on the U-bahn.We had made an advanced internet booking which worked out at just over one hundred English pounds for three nights for the room alone.The staff made us welcome and the room was excellent. We did not take any meals at the hotel but used the bar in the evening where prices were similar to local cafes. Free internet access just by the bar was useful. We will certainly return.

<Content>Great Deal We stayed 4 nights at this hotel (2 adults 1 child). It is quite modern (not more than 2 years old), very clean, they gave us a large beautiful family room, staff is efficient. Just beware the pillows, they are too soft but you can ask some more at the reception. Nice breackfast and wonderful located, 50 meters from an U-Bahn station and 1 Km away from the Main Railway Station (HauptBanhof). And Berlin is a great lovely city. Will be back and at Mercure Charite.

<Content>Great location, gtreat value This hotel is in a great location. It is within walking distance of Oranienburger Strasse and all its bars and restaurants but there is a tram stop and subway stop less than 1 min from the front door of the hotel.Its a very clean and modern hotel and the bar always seemed to be quite popular but not noisy.We stayed here for three nights over a weekend and it was great value for money...鈧?00 for the three nights for a double room.We would stay here again , next time we visit berlin.

<Content>Great Stay The hotel was clean, spacious, inexpensive, and more than anything, hospitable. The staff was very willing to help with questions and plans. The waiters in the breakfast room were equally pleasant, and I might add the breakfast was great. I would ABSOLUTELY stay here again. The only thing that was slightly disappointing was the lack of restaurants in the neighborhood and exterior charm. You really have to take the U-Bahn to do anything. Nevertheless, I would prefer returning to this hotel to staying at the much more expensive hotel my friends stayed at on the KuDam.

<Content>great value - in der mitte just returned from a two night stay at the mercure - a very unpromising facade, but don't let that put you off! We payed around 70 euro a night - and i was pleasently surprised. We had an enormous room, big comfy kingsize bed and a great shower. Couldn't ask for anymore really, about a 20 minute stroll to mitte and hackescher markt. A good value base in Berlin.

<Content>Excellent value! My husband and I stayed at Mercure an der Charite (former Dorint an der Charite, according to the towels鈥? in August 2005 during our Berlin weekend break. We travel a lot, and in my opinion the deal was excellent: 59 euros per night (the breakfast would have been available for 13 euros per person).The hotel is conveniently located next to Zinnerwitzer subway station, and you can easily travel from Tegel airport by using public transportation. Our room was smallish and simply decorated, and very clean. The only thing we missed was a minibar (in other words: a fridge to keep water bottles cold), but for this rate it is fully understandable that there is not one. I was very glad that the hairdryer in the room was powerful enough, unfortunately many hotels have these wall-mounted jokes and it takes ages to dry thick long hair with those. There are 2 supermarkets, Subway sandwich shop and Balzaco coffee shop around the corner. I would also like to recommend SpeiseKombinat - the restaurant located at Chaussee Strasse (again, around the corner). Delicious, affordably priced eastern-mediterranean food - if weather allows, enjoy your meal at their patio.We also visited Hafenbar near the hotel. If you are in your early twenties, german speaker plus love 70's hits - this disco is for you. Other folks - you'd better skip the place ;)

<Content>Ideal for the tourist I have just got back from a long weekend in Berlin, once I had mastered the S Bahn and U Bahn it was easy to get to Zinnowitzer Strasse station (50m away from the hotel).Rooms were nicely furnished, very modern and light, however room is a little small- but if you are a tourist it's ideal. Only a shower in the bathroom, so if you like a soak in the bath after a lot of walking then this is probably not for you!Safe deposit boxes are available from the main reception, so don't panic like I did thinking their is nowhere to leave your money! Their is a deposit to pay which is refunded when you check out. Staff were very polite and helpful, they spoke much better English than I spoke German and had a lot of helpful information to supply me with. Close to Oranienburger Strasse, with numerous places to eat, and from their most attractions are within walking distance.Berlin is accesible by foot, however the U and S Bahns will probably be used, so being close to a station is helpful. Only takes a matter of minutes to travel between stations - be careful though, on weekends the U Bahn does not run as frequently!

<Content>Great value and location in East Berlin I've stayed at this hotel twice - once right after it opened in December 2002 and then in August, 2003, when it was still a Dorint. The staff was friendly and helpful. The clientele is mostly European with few Americans - so few, in fact, that the bartender remembered me on my second visit! Rooms are compact, but well designed. Location is terrific - convenient to bus, tram and U-Bahn. Buffet breakfast (included) was plentiful and good. On my second trip, I had a package which included two dinners, not nearly as good as the breakfasts. The menu is unaccountably Italian, which seemed to stretch the skills of the German chef. But since the meals were esstentially free and they served late, I didn't much care. I prefer staying in the East, where most of the hotels are new and expensive, so I consider this a great find and would definitely stay here again.
