<Content>OK but watch for the expensive food! We had a mixed experience, staying for 3 nights with 2 children (3  7). When we arrived the staff were very friendly and kept the children entertained while we checked in. We were advised of a special offer were we could upgrade our room for a minimal charge which we declined (we were tired and just wanted to get to bed!) but with hindsight I wish we'd taken it up!The room had a funny smell - others have mentioned damp and this was my first impression. My husband thought it could just be the cleaning products but it smelt like damp. Otherwise the room was OK - spacious with 2 double beds that were comfortable and clean. The decor looked a little tired and work out but was otherwise OK.Our biggest complaint was with the buffet in the Spice Market. After a day of sightseeing we decided to eat in the restaurant and had the buffet. There was a great range of food but our kids were tired and ate very little. Subsequently we also didn't eat a lot. When we got the bill we found that we'd been charged HK $1200 for the meal! Wildly expensive and over-priced!!!!One hint is to try the self-serve take-away bakery on the road to the right of the hotel entrance. Cheap, delicious and a fun experience for the kids.

<Content>WOW , Prince Hotel Marco Polo Prince hotel is the best budget price for me with my family because of easy access to Tsim Sha Tsui station,Nathan Road and to harbour city shopping malls which you can do shopping, eat , stroll and many more which you will not get bored. No problem if you get tired because all you have to do is to return to prince hotel without walking to the streets, the hotel is very convenient for travellers who wants to visit HK !

<Content>Awful The rooms in this hotel are awful and nothing like the pictures that were featured in the trailfinders brochure that we booked from. They are outdated and grubby and in serious need of refurbishment. The first room we were given had a serious damp problem (no 1112) and one wall was all lumpy due to the damp on the plaster beneath, but rather than deal with the problem, the hotel had just tried to crudely cover it up with some new wallpaper. When I asked to move rooms they told me that we had been given one of their best standard rooms as we were on honeymoon (this just meant that we got a glimpse of the side of the harbour where the China Ferries dock, past an office building. In my humble opinion, not exactly a view to die for). They then showed me to another room that was the same grubby outdated decor, but at least it didn't appear to have a damp problem. The lady who showed me to the new room told me that they have had a lot of guests complain about the rooms, but they are always busy so they don't want to close to renovate. Clearly they are only busy because of first time chumps like us who didn't realise how bad it was, and are not interested in making the hotel a nice experience so that they get repeat bookings. This hotel is awful and I will be warning off everyone I can from staying there. I don't know what hotels the reviewer below who said this hotel was the best in the world has been staying at before, but it seems to me they are either connected with the hotel, or their review relates to a different hotel entirely. Whilst the shopping centre attached to the hotel is nice (Harbour City), Kowloon is very frustrating if you are western, and this is not because of the locals. As you walk along the street you will see many Indian men loitering, waiting for westerners to walk past to offer copy handbags, copy watches or the services of a British tailor. This gets very annoying as even if you walk on the other side of the pavement and there are many local Chinese people in between you and them, they will push through to target you just because you are western and they know that you are on holiday. My hubby got so annoyed with one that kept talking at us even though it was clear that we weren't interested that he shushed him, which did not go down well. These men really spoilt our enjoyment of the place, and as there are none over on the Island, we wish we'd stayed on the other side of the harbour instead.

<Content>What a Disappointment We had just return from our trip to Hong Kong last week. It was our first time there. The Prince Hotel was not like the photo's at all. We have four kids and it was not place to take kids too. At first, when you arrive and was taken to the lobby, it looked like the hotel was elegant and was living up to it's name but then when you had stayed there for a couple days, it turns out to be a drag. The Lobby is too small an narrow with not enough seats for guests. There were heaps of people coming and going. The staff walking around the lobby stared at us (our kids) constantly giving us the evil look. We were waiting for our pick up to the airport and had to wait outside on the stairs in the shopping mall.The rooms were very old. The carpets seems like they hadn't been changed since the hotel was erected to matched the old furnitures and TV set. We had rooms with the interal access and they had put a single matress in between the doors. The hot water tap was so sentative that a slight turn meant that you were in serious trouble of being burnt while the bottom tap was running while you were showering. We had full buffet breakfast included in the Spice Market but it was no way a family orientated.Another thing was that they give you keys instead of cards and everytime you went out of the hotel, you had to give them the keys....The two positive comments I can make is that the the location of the hotel was in walking distance to the shops, restuarants etc, and the staff (front desk) were very helpful in giving you directions on where you want to go.

<Content>Excellent Hotel I was a little bit hesitant in booking at this hotel due to varied reports.Stay 1 - 10th to 18th Sept 2008.I am glad I did. From Limo transfer, check-in, standard of room, staff helpfullness, we could not have done much better.Our room, on the 15th floor, was clean and tidy with a well stocked mini bar, and a bowl of fruit. All room facilities were in good working order and room was well serviced during our stay.Food in the Spice Market restaurant was of a high standard and plentiful.The hotel is in a shopping mall, and can be accessed from Canton Road or through the mall itself.Stay 2 - 27th to 29th Sept 2008.Had an upgraded room, on 16th floor, arrived at 0700 and room was available.As before thoroughly pleased with our stay there.

<Content>Location and Breakfast were great Stayed with my family in a room with two queen beds. The room was a bit small for all four of us and was looking a bit worn, however we were not in Hong Kong to sit in a room.The location of this hotel is fantastic. Located in Harbour City so close to the ferry terminal and Tsim Sha Tsui MRT Station gives you access to everything. Kowloon markets can easily be walked.We also loved the breakfast which had plenty for my kids who have very western tastes and for my wife and I who wanted to try more local dishes. I think we all left the hotel 1kg heavier each morning.Staff were friendly and helpful when we needed it. We would definately stay here again.

<Content>Marco Polo Prince - great location shame about the rooms I stayed here for a very hot and steamy week in August on a business trip. And I can say that the experience overall was only satisfactory and no better.The hotel itself could not be situated any better. It is built into the Harbour City mall, and what a place that is! 700 or so top brand name shops that you could seriously bankrupt yourself in - Hong Kong is not the shopper's paradise it probably used to be, but you can still shop till you drop!Unfortunately the Marco Polo Prince probably lives off it's location - whilst the main hotel areas are perfectly perfectly presentable, the rooms themselves are in need of a makeover. That's not to say that they're bad, everything is there and cleaned as best they can be, but you know that a hotel is a step or two behind when you're handed an actual key (yes a key! How often do you see one of those these days?) for your room.The breakfast buffet was only average at best. On the first day that I was there the cereal that I chose was stale and way past it's best. And when trying the hot alternative, the bacon was so overcooked that it exploded into a million pieces as soon as it was touched with a fork. If you'd had to pay HK$120 for it, you would have been very disappointed.The lunch buffet I had at the Prince Deli was awful. It was in theory a beef goulash that I'd chosen, but it more closely resembled something that I'd feed my dog. By contrast the bubbles lounge bar served an excellent lunch, gnocchi as a main course followed by a delightful cheesecake and coffee afterwards.The staff were throughout the hotel were friendly and helpful, particularly the reception staff and bellboys (one of them was very helpful in elbowing me to the front of the taxi queue to get to the airport in a hurry!), so it was just a shame that the rooms and food don't quite live up to the staff's enthusiasm.

<Content>Good location Stayed at this hotel with my wife and 2 children (11 and 14) as it was one of very few hotels to allow us to stay in one room. Like many of the other reviewers, I found that it was in an excellent location. (part of a huge shopping mall with over 700 shops from small supermarkets to many designer shops). The hotel was within a short walk to many of the museums, star ferry etc. Found many great restaurants nearby including the beckinghams? bakery on the ground floor of the shopping centre across from the entry to the hotel, the quarterdeck - in the shopping centre same floor as toys are us (steaks, fish, pasta - great views of hong kong island from the back tables). The room (I stayed in 1505) was fine with reasonable space..Staff at the hotel were helpful and the breakfast had a good range of food for all tastes.

<Content>Great location, outdated rooms The hotel is in a great location to check out the sights in Hong Kong. It's about a 5 minute walk to the MRT. It's about a 10 minute walk through the Harbour shopping mall to the Star Ferry, which takes you to Central on Hong Kong Island.It's also a great place to check out Kowloon on foot. It's only a 5 minute walk to Nathan Road. It's about a 10 minute walk to an restaurant/bar area called Knutsford Steps (on Kimberly Road) that has a variety of resturants: Turkish, French, Italian, Russian, Austrailan, etc. There are also local Chinese restaurants near the hotel.The rooms were clean, but outdated. The room looked drab with tones of tan. It really didn't bother us though since we didn't spend much time in our room. The breakfast buffet was ok, nothing too exciting. There was a selction of Asian and Western breakfast foods. Overall, the staff was helpful and friendly when we had questions about how to get around.

<Content>World's best hotel I have stayed in hotels in 63 different countries in the past 3 years and the Marco Polo Prince Hotel would have to be the best 4 star hotel yet.From check-in, the room itself, the restaurants - everything was perfect.I wanted to attend a Trade Show and the staff went out of their way to oblige me.

<Content>Honest value, efficient staff Had stayed in this hotel many years previously. We do like the slightly larger than average superior level rooms. Even though they and the perhaps the plumbing are in need of some refurbishment, it was very clean and quiet for such a busy area. Corner glimpses of the harbour but no direct views as far as I could see, not that this was a problem for us. Extremely handy for our pre and post cruise stay. The cooked buffet breakfast in the Spice Market restaurant, although plentiful and catering to all tastes, was a little disappointing and not up the standard of other similar hotels we have stayed. There was a slightly greasy, over-cooked aspect to many of the hot dishes on offer and even some of the bakery offerings seemed as if they had overstayed their welcome. Overall reasonable value for money.

<Content>Great Location, good value for money for a family This was one of the few HK hotels that would allow a family of 4 to stay in one room- most wanted us to book two rooms. Our room was quite large with two double beds, and space for a little table and two chairs. As others have noted the decor in the rooms needs updating, and some of the fittings definitely need replacing. However it was very handy to have cupboards and a fridge to store food for snacks/breakfast. Besides the Spice Market Deli that others have mentioned, there are two supermarkets in the shopping complex that are handy for buying milk, bottled water, fruit etc. For dinner, there is an almost overwhelming choice of restaurants but we found the Canton Deli on the 3rd floor to be very reliable and good value for chinese food. Overall, our experience of the hotel was very good. A minor criticism was that the arrangement of lights in the room was not convenient. It is impossible to read in bed or elsewhere in the room without disturbing the other occupants. I ended up reading in the bathroom!

<Content>Location, location, location I've been staying at the Prince Hotel for several years, most recently in March 2008. What this hotel really has going for it is its fantastic location, attached directly to Ocean Terminal and close to other major shopping destinations, to the Star Ferry, and also to the underground (MTR). It makes going around Hong Kong (or even across the water for a quick getaway to Macau) extremely convenient.However, the hotel is in dire need of a renovation. It looks exactly the same as it did more than a decade ago. The carpets are old and faded, the bathroom tiles and fixtures worn out. It doesn't even have its own gym, and instead just offers a discount to a local gym in the area.Food is good, and moderately priced. The staff is courteous enough.On the whole, I still think it's a great place to stay, since when in Hong Kong, I barely spend time in my hotel room anyway, and its prime location makes my days of shopping and sight seeing extremely easy and convenient.

<Content>Good Value, friendly staff, good food. Spent 5 nights at the Prince and returned a week later for 2 more nights.Hotel rooms are a bit old, but functionable, clean, well serviced and comfortable. All staff were excellent - reception, rooms, restaurants (Spice Market has a superb breakfast and equally good staff.)We had a slight communication problem with one of the Concierge staff, but eventually we managed to work out our tours and all went off smoothly.Hotel is located at the northern end of the huge shopping complex - Harbour City. Use a map if you enter - you'll need it. Level 3 is best and easiest to get used to. It is on Nathan road, close to MTR. (Underground Rail) on Nathan St

<Content>Great Location. So-So Hotel. Marco Polo hotels seem to proliferate around Hong Kong, which must explain why attention to detail and good service were overlooked along the way. Marco Polo Prince sits adjacent to Marco Polos Hong Kong and Gateway. I don't know about the other two in this area, but Prince felt more like a spruced-up Holiday Inn motel to me. Which is a waste, since it's very near the Harbor City shopping mall, this gigantic shopper's haven which occupied a lot of my time (and cash!). The overall look of the area felt and looked like it was in a pretty upscale location, but from the instant we entered our hotel, it felt dark, dingy, and the staff were stiff and overly reserved, making us feel unwelcome. Budget-wise though, they gave good packages. The only reason why I'm rating it 3 stars instead of 2 is because we didn't really encounter any problems with the hotel per se. It was just the whole atmosphere of the hotel that didn't agree with me, and I'm usually a happy camper.

<Content>Worth staying in, BUT... Upon arrival, I was greeted with an irritating shock. Despite nobody mentioning otherwise, our room would not be ready for a few hours after we arrived, leaving us to carry heavy bags to Starbucks, where we killed some time until the rooms were ready. The receptionist also tried to charge us $2000HK extra for mini-bar and in-room movies (something which also went unmentioned) and we had no plans to use these. Fortunately, they let it go. Unfortunately the reception staff are inefficient and keen on charging extra for something or other...but once you can get past them, the hotel is quite good. The hotel is connected to a shopping complex, which is a guarenteed advantage to those who enjoy aimlessly spending cash. Compared to what is available in my native Australia, it is bloody huge. The location is overall very good, with the MTR a few blocks away, the ferry a short walk, and a collosal shopping centre connected to the building. As for the room? Well, it was quite a good size. Fairly clean and nice looking too, although the refurbished lobby may overinflate your expectations, and the view from the window was crap. It has a television, wireless internet access, and free room-to-room or local calls. I suggest avoiding the in-room movies, though. They are much more expensive than a rental at home, and if you're lucky, you might even see the film for free on the plane home (I did). In the same vein, the mini-bar is horrendously overpriced. The mall below has a Wellcome grocery shop, which will sell you exactly the same things for much less. As for the breakfast? I think we have a winner. It doesn't cost a lot, either. The Spice Market restaraunt on the third floor of the hotel has buffet breakfasts with western, continental, local, and Japanese options. With unlimited bacon, waffles, danish pastries, dumplings, grilled salmon, rice, and fresh fruit, you won't be leaving hungry. So if you can get over the poor view and the inefficient staff, you probably won't be disappointed. The hotel is not for everybody, but if you come prepared for the downsides, the Prince should provide a good stay.

<Content>Central Hotel is busy Kowloon There are a number of hotels in this recently completed shopping complex in Kowloon. The Prince Hotel appears to be one of the older ones and is in a good location. With the large shopping complexes outside the door and its proximity to Nathan Road it is a good base for exploring Hong Kong. There is some refurbishment ongoing so the leisure centre was unavailable and there wasa cost to use the one in the adjacent sister hotel. We travelled with young kids and felt that the hotel was neither chield friendly or child unfriendly.

<Content>Basic family friendly hotel in a great location My husband, 5 year old daughter and 3 year old son stayed at the Prince Hotel from Dec 28 to Dec 31. As other people have noted, the reception area and lobby has been beautifully refurbished but as you get out of the lift to get to your room it is little like entering a time warp. However as I had already read this I had prepared myself, so it wasn't as bad as I had imagined!! The room in general was very large and clean, but the bathroom badly needed refurbishing. The location of the hotel is EXCELLENT - right at the doorstep of the malls and only a couple of blocks to the MTR. Breakfast was not included with our room so we looked for the Prince Deli that I had read about on this website. We walked through the Prince Spice Market that had a buffet breakfast that looked and smelt divine. Immediately at the end of the Spice Market was the Prince Deli that offered a few breakfast choices - my husband and kids picked the bacon, eggs, sausage, hash browns with tea/coffee or juice and I picked the congee with dumplings with tea/cofee or juice. Each meal was only $27HK and the food quality was very good. BARGAIN!!In general we were very happy at this hotel and would stay there again.

When we asked the reception, they gave mixed  unclear explanations. However, rooms were very clean and although a bit small (but good size for hong kong standard). Got 2 double beds, which is a plus point. Overall service was very good and efficient. At first we got a room, which had some problems with the bathroom pipes. We asked to be moved, and they moved us right away. For its location, the hotel offer good lodging at reasonable price. We would probably try the MPHK next time.

<Content>Good, but a different world beyond the lobby A shining bright lobby welcomed me to this hotel, which enjoys an excellent location. However, once I got out of the elevator to go to my room I wondered whether I had stepped into a different hotel. The ambiance looked somewhat cheap, old and outdated. The room itself was just alike, though very clean, with a large bathroom and a very comfortable bed. Just what I needed after an 11-hour overnight flight.Indeed the hotel is nothing exceptional but overall I had a positive experience, thanks also to a scromptuous breakfast buffet. There are, and I have used several better option in HK, but I enjoyed my stay and the value for money was good. I think I will use this hotel again in the future.

<Content>nice second choice While I prefer the more upscale Marco Polo HongKong Hotel, the Prince is a very good alternate during periods when the hotel rates are high, as the Prince is about 20% less expensive. Location is sensational. The rooms are not tiny or huge, a little above average for Hong Kong. Bathrooms are large and lots of counter space. Beds are very comfortable. Buffet breakfast is very good and the hotel offered discounted prices for this 3 day stay. High-speed internet in room is very fast and not overpriced. Lobby is small but well-manned and the service was friendly and professional.

<Content>Adequate. Stayed at the Prince for one week whilst on business. On arrival the Porter took my luggage and I checked in. I had half an hour to get ready for a night out - 20 minutes later still no luggage. I rang reception and they said it had been taken by the members of my other party? I told them I had checked in on my own and they were very confused. After much running around, my bags were located 6th Floors down with the people who checked in before me. Nobody apologised and they looked quite put out by the incident.Room was not as good as I thought it would be. 1970s MFI furniture and decor. The bathroom also had a stale smell. On the plus side, the bed was big and comfy and the bathroom adequate. Would have liked the 'free' water to be visible rather than in the mini-bar and wasn't informed on my arrival that local calls from my room were free - only found this out on the last day.Lobby Lounge - nice but I ordered a PImms and got a whiskey! Only believed me when a friend pointed out that Pimms is red.Best bit about the hotel was breakfast - good variety and friendly staff.The other thing about this hotel is that whilst it has it's advantages being attached to a shopping mall - anybody can gain access to the hotel and wonder around. Wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Great hotel, superb location We stayed in the MCP for the first 3 days of our honeymoon and what a start. We upgraded to a business class room for the princely sum of HK$350 per night (about 鈧?0) and for that had our own private breakfast room (full silver service), a larger room and higher up so a bit further away from the street noise.The hotel was spotlessly clean, and attached directly to a shopping mall (which the wife loved!) which ran the length of the Canton Road and came out at the Star Ferry terminal. We were ther in September so being able to stay in the lovely air conditioned confines was a god send!The hotel is also directly opposite Kowloon City Park, well worth a visit early in the morning to watch the local residents practicing their tai chi and Kung Fu - brilliant!Hotel gets 5/5 for me.

<Content>good place to stay Great location. Near Nathan Road and the Tsimshatsui MTR station. Also about a ten to fifteen minute walk to Avenue of the Stars to witness the Symphony of Lights. Staff are very accommodating. Very large rooms! A typical room for 2 can easily accommodate about 4 more people. Hotel was also connected to Harbor City Mall so easy access shopping (and dining) is also possible. Since its near the MTR station, access to everything on the island and HK island is easy and possible. I'd recommend this hotel.

<Content>No problems at the Prince My husband, 13 yr old son and I spent 5 nights at the Prince. We initially found it hard to locate because everyone kept directing us into a shopping Mall until we finally realized that the hotel was integrated into the Mall.We found this strange at first but quickly accepted the idea and after a day of sight seeing would stop off at the supermarket on level 3 and pick up supplies.Our room was comfortable, clean and quite spacious, it had no view however. This didn't bother us and so we didn't take the offer of a harbour view room for another $100 HK a night. We found the staff helpful and the location quite convenient especially to the ferries. You can walk through a series of Malls all the way to the ferry.We had breakfast at the hotel every day and it was good but not fantastic. Would I stay there again? Yes, it represents value and just good service and accommodation.

<Content>Not what we hoped for ... OK, we get it, Hong Kong is expensive! :) The Marco Polo Prince is an entry level upper-ish tier hotel in Kowloon, so our expectations were at least above average. If you pay that much in a city like DC or Boston, you get a pretty decent place. Plus it's not that much less than the Sheraton down the road in Kowloon ($30/night less or so), so again, we were hoping for a nice place to spend a romantic vacation. (BTW, after the first night we would have moved in a jiffy if the Sheraton had rooms).While the lobby is nice, the hotel rooms feel OLD. They are tiny. The view was of a building right across an alley. We were on a rare vacation and wanted a view, so we called down politely asking if we could move, even if it meant paying more. We were told no, there were no rooms left in the hotel. I got internet access ($18/night BTW), checked online, and found that there were indeed other rooms available in the hotel for THAT night at a range of rates. Whatever.The electronic circuitry is old, so much so that there is actually a sign in the bathroom saying that the plug there is ONLY for razors because anything that draws more power will blow a fuse. My wife was looking for a blow dryer, which we couldn't find, so we called the reception desk. They told us to look in the drawer of the desk (the one the TV is on top of!), where sure enough an antique blow dryer lived. It was wired/attached directly into the desk (you couldn't remove it), so you were in the odd situation of drying your hair with nothing to look at except the TV. An amenity in the eyes of some, I suppose.We were there in January, so the weather was a bit cold at night. The heating system was at least 20 years old, and its controller was simply an Austin Powers era 4 push button deal (off, low, medium, high) with an odd little dial that you could twist towards + or -. We tried all combinations, and while the fan worked, none spat out any heat at all.One night we tried to watch a movie ... the Pay-Per-View didn't work. We called reception, who sent someone who confirmed it wasn't working. They were very helpful, but I had to stop them from sending in a repairman at 11 pm ... thanks but no thanks (probably should have bought a $2 DVD off the street instead).Plus two mornings in a row they tried a ploy to charge more $. They left a message on our voicemail. I called and got a friendly recording reminding me of the increase in rate that night. Huh? My online reservations said nothing of this. It turns out they were about to charge us an extra 100 HKD for a breakfast we didn't ask for. I told them the first time that we don't eat breakfast, and they assured me they would remove it. It happened again the next day, and I again called them to ask them to remove it (somewhat annoyed I wasn't spending this time out enjoying myself). They said they could do it for day #2, but since I never asked them to remove the charge for day #1 (!!!), they had no choice but to charge me for the breakfast I didn't have yesterday. I argued, and they did eventually remove both mornings. But for $200 a night, should you have to put up with this crap?My strong advice is get a bargain hotel that actually goes for a bargain price, or pay the small extra and go for the Sheraton. Forget about Marco Polo ... it ain't worth it.

<Content>It's all in the service This was our final stop after a 4 week trip around Mainland China and was a treat for 2 tired travellers. We arrived at just after 1am and they way we were greeted you'd think it was the middle of the afternoon, the staff were bright, cheerful and keen to help.The room was surprisingly spacious with acres of space in the wardrobe for our clothes, a large bathroom and plenty of cubby holes to stash our gear in.View wasn't much to write home about but when Hong Kong the last thing you need is a good view, far better to be 10 minutes walk from the harbour so you can really soak it up!The location is sensational, there are loads of little shops just across the road which can cater to all your needs, we ate in a little noodle restaurant across the street where all the staff from the surrounding shops and hotels ate which served great food really cheaply.Couldn't have hoped for a better place to stay for the money! Although it was a little confusing at first when we realised that there are 3 Marco Polo hotels in Harbour City!

<Content>Prince staff shines My wife and I had a six night stay at the Prince Oct 9-15. The staff are very accomodating and welcoming. The rooms are currently being updated. They are spacious enough with large bathroom that is clean. The Housekeeping staff are diligent and friendly. The location is perfect; short walk to the MTR, Ferry and 20HK taxi to the airport train (kowloon). Close to the Temple street night market and all that TST has to offer. A must do at the Hotel is the Buffet breakfast that you can make a deal for. THe dinner is also great for a change. Connected to Harbour City mall, there is a great food court area with ample choices of fresh Thai, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese, Taiwanese, Japanese and fresh bakery. Would stay there again.

<Content>will return Booked a last minute break in HK in early September 06 and the travel agent advised me of a good package deal to the MP Prince how glad we were that she did. The staff were extremely helpful and courteous, the suite was large and well furnished although all views from the windows were of other buildings walls. Hey how long do you stand at the windows looking out.Can really advise anyone to stay at the Prince you will not be dissappointed.

<Content>Good service, great breakfast We stayed one night June 06, and one night July 06 (stopovers) - great location, staff are excellent (especially Ivan), room was large - we had two adults and two children, so had a rollaway bed and two doubles. Bathroom is spacious and very clean. Toiletries are plenty - and they supply robes and slippers. Breakfast buffet is fantastic - what a choice. Curtains are so thick that you'd better set the alarm if you don't want to miss breakfast. I'd stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful housekeeping staff at the Marco Polo Prince We've been to Hong Kong many times but always stayed on the Hong Kong side. This time, we chose to stay in Kowloon and picked Marco Polo Prince. We paid a bit more than if we had stayed in a 3-star hotel but no way did we regret the extra expenses incurred because we had a wonderful time. First, checking in was a breeze. The receptionist even graciously agreed to a late check-out time because our return flight would be at late night. Second, the huge bathroom came as a surprise to us. We had read about how HK hotel rooms are cramped but the one assigned to us was more than adequate. The bed was a bit hard but we still managed to sleep soundly. The toiletries are of good quality and the bathtub was clean, perfect for soaking after a tiring day.Third, Marco Polo Prince is adjacent to the Harbour City Mall, which houses the top and expensive brands (Gucci, Chanel, Coach, Louis Vuitton) and home-grown HK brands (Episode, Jessica). There is another mall (Ocean Terminal) that is connected to Harbour City, so it seems like you are walking forever in the mall. There are Western-style restaurants in both malls, for those who would like to defer from Asian food, though I must say that Hong Kong offers an eclectic mix of cuisines to choose from.Fourth, Marco Polo Prince is near Nathan Road, which is where you will find more shopping. There is an MTR nearby. If you walk towards Salisbury Road, you will find the Star Ferry terminal, Clock Tower, Space Museum and Avenue of Stars.The best part of our stay in Marco Polo Prince is discovering that the housekeeping staff are an honest lot, particularly the cleaning lady named Michelle. On our 3rd day, we forgot to lock our safety box. When Michelle came to clean our room, she discovered the open box and proceeded to inform the duty manager about it. For security reasons, they double-locked our hotel room and not even our key could open the door when we got back. All valuables (camera, cellphone, etc.) were in place when we checked. Nothing was lost.Because of our great experience, the Marco Polo Prince is now on top of our list and each time we visit Hong Kong, we will make sure to stay at this excellent hotel.

<Content>Excellent hotel in Tsim Tsa Tsui Stayed at the hotel from 14-18 June 2006. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The room was very big, especially for a hotel room in HK. The location is excellent as well. It is attached to Harbour city, an upmarket shopping mall with more than 700 brands. There are alot of cafes, restaurants and shops in the mall. There are many shops outside the mall as well, including a duty free shop and several other branded stores. Hard Rock Cafe is nearby too. The MTR station is a stone's throw away. You will not find it far as there are alot of shops to look at along the way there. Overall...a good hotel to consider, though it may be quite old....but it is still well maintained.

<Content>Marco Polo Prince gives excellent value in a great location We have now stayed at the MP Prince on 4 occasions, and it has become our first choice when travelling through Hong Kong with our 2 children. The rooms are large by Hong Kong standards - 2 double beds and spacious bathroom/dressing room area. I would say that it is some years since the rooms were last redecorated, but this is more than compensated by the great value they represent (at least when booked through Trailfinders!) and the space they offer. The Spice Market buffet has a wide variety of Asian and western cuisine and is a big hit with our kids (who love cooking their own waffles!) The staff are always extremely courteous and helpful. Good location on Kowloon - in Harbour City shopping mall with dozens of upmarket shops, leading down to the waterfront and the Star Ferry. Also near MTR.

<Content>Great Location - Tired Hotel - Not Recommended We stayed at the Marco Polo Prince Hotel in Kowloon (Hong Kong) for 2 nights in April 06. This hotel is in a great location - walking distance to all the Kowloon action - the foyer is modern but the rooms are very tired. The beds are a shocker - hard and very uncomfortable and if you are looking to get the head down on an comfy bed - this is not the hotel for you. The pillows are worse - they sink flat - so combine that with the hard old bed - and you get no sleep and a bad back - all for plenty of HK$$$. The spice marekt on lkevel 3 has the best buffet in Asia - no issue there and there is value for money in this buffet. The hotel is connected to a shopping centre - good shops and a good coffee shop. The bar prices in the hotel will send you broke - find a better place to drink - there are plenty around. On the streets around the hotel you will get hustled for girls - mostly by a sexy female mama. Thats just par for the course in Asia. Find another hotel - this one is too uncomfortable.

<Content>just the best jusr back from 10 nights at this great hotel. upgraded to a suite and loved the room. great size for a family and all the shopping bags. great position and great restaurants nearby. service was excellent rang for an iron and it arrived so quick i thought they must have been waiting in the corridor. my only problem if you could call it that was the one bed i slept in was very firm and it took some time to get used to..i would only stay at this hotel or maybe another marco polo hotel on my return as it made the vacation special.

<Content>Impressed by the Prince My wife and I have just returned from 8 nights in HK staying at this excellent hotel. On arrival check-in was completed in a matter of minutes and all the booking details and inclusions were spot on. We were upgraded to a standard suite due to the length of our stay. The room was very clean and attention to detail was excellent. The toiletries supplied was a very nice touch as were the bath robes and scuffs. We found the buffet breakfast to be excellent, numerous choices of hot and cold dishes. This was paid for at the time of booking the hotel at the travel agent and is a must. Great value for money. The staff at the hotel were always polite and friendly. Nothing was to hard. The location was great as well. Being on Canton Road you are only a few minutes walk from the MTR, Star Ferry Terminal and buses. The hotel is part of a shopping complex with very easy access. Overall we would have no hesitation in staying again and throughly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Tricky bookings.... We stayed there for the complete Chinese New Year. The staff is very friendly. We got a suite room but then we were told, this could only last until New Year, then we had to move into a different room with a higher price. With a smile on the face the receptionist explained high booking season.. O.K., but what a surprise - we came into a single room, very small, small bed.. really terrible. After our complains we could move back into our previous room (the price didn麓t move back, of course).I did the booking through my HK partners, the Marco Polo never sends out printed/email confirmations! You only get a booking ref#, that麓s it. Pre-programmed trouble. They overcharged us on the breakfast rate, we had no proof of our deal. The location is good, you can reach many POI in a footwalk distance.
