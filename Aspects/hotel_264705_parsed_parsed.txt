<Content>Excellent Paris Hotel We stayed for 3 nights. The first night we had a room facing the street which was very noisey. When I asked that we be moved to a quieter room the staff were very nice about it and we were given a larger and much quieter room. Everything was very clean and looked to be recently decorated. This hotel is excellent value for the money and I would definately stay there again.

<Content>Good big city hotel We recently stayed in Paris for a few nights and booked this hotel based on availability and reviews from tripadvisor. Our experience confirms much of what we read here. The hotel is well located to the Metro and some great bakeries across the road with restaurants not too far away (the bar downstairs even does ok food and good people watching drinks with great service). The size is as most other Paris and European city hotels and, typical of other Paris stays in this class of hotel, the walls can be a little thin and those above having late night showers can generate a lot of noise through pipes. However it suits the need given the price. Furthermore the staff were happy to help as required - particularly when we were impacted by the Eurostar tunnel fire.Happy to recommend hotel Innova.

<Content>Second visit We first satyed here in September last year and had a great time. So when we deicded to visit Paris again there was no hesitation to book once more.The hotel is in a fantastic location with a Metro just yards from the door. This allows easy and very cheap transport to anywhere in Paris.I can't reccomend the Metro highly enough. It is cheap (buy the carnet tickets, a book of ten) punctual, clean and safe. It is currently under going a major refurbishment at the moment so the occasional station may be closed but free busses are laid onStaff in the hotel are brilliant. the desk staff are extremely helpful, their English is far better than my French and they are always on hand to help. The domestic staff do a great job. Cheerful and the rooms get cleaned + new towels every day.The rooms are freshly decorated, the lift new and a lovely smell of leather from the new furniture in the reception.Within a 5 minute walk there loads of cafes, resturants, fruit shops, small supermarkets, pharmacies.All the major tourist attractions are no more than 15 mins by metro away.For the money you'll be hard pressed to find better. It's the perfect base.

<Content>Can't say enough about this Hotel! - Please read about lost wallet!!! Hotel Innova is terrific. It was my runner up for a trip last december, and I was glad I got to stay there this time. My girfriend and I stayed for a couple nights and everything was great.They were renovating the lobby when we stayed, and it looked like it would be very nice when finished. The rooms were nice, and the elevator was newly renovated. It's easy to see that they are putting a lot into the place. Breakfast on the 1st floor was very good, and they also offer free internet in the lobby.The best part - I left my wallet in the nightstand, and the manager went way out of his way to get it back to me. If you're a frequent traveller and have ever left something in a room, you know how hard it is to get it back. Well, the housekeeper found it and gave it to the manager, who then called my us cell phone and emailed me, before I even noticed it was gone. We took the TGV to the south of france that morning, and arranged to have DHL pick it up. He put the wallet in an envelope inside another envelope and sent it back, everything inside. My GF and I both speak french and had a good time in France, but as always, there were a few times when we struggled with the 'indifference' french people in service businesses show to travelers. That's why we were so amazed with the extra effort and professionalism the hotel showed. I would definintely recommend that you stay at the Innova.

<Content>Great location We have just returned from the Hotel Innova having had a wonderful short break. The hotel is everything you could ask for on this kind of budget (90 Euro per night). The hotel is no more than 50 yards from the metro station (Pasteur) and has a wide variety of bistros, cafes, bakeries, restaurants in its immediate vicinity. There is also a couple of pharmacies within 50 yards should you require toiletries/medical advice. The hotel does have digital air conditioning, wifi, pay as you go internet, lift (great disabled access) and very good showers. The rooms are typical in size for Paris and furnished more modernly than your typical Paris hotel. Breakfast is an optional extra at 9 Euro per person although we chose to use the bakeries in the area instead. Location is ideal for Montparnasse which hosts a large number of restaurants, you are only 2 Metro stops away or a 7-8 min walk. If you are in the area you must try the Sud Ouest Et Cie, it is very reasonable and specialises in duck dishes although others are available. Overall the Innova ticked all our boxes, great location/friendly/well priced and spotless.

<Content>great value for money, very friendly and helpful staff My husband and i stayed at Hotel Innova for 4 nights and we arrived back in Ireland today. I have to recommend the hotel on its cleanliness, friendly staff and location in relation to the metro. The room that we stayed in was not that small and was exceptional clean, with a very powerful shower. When we request information for our daily trips the staff were very informative. The metro is right across the street, which will take you to the Champs Elysees in 10m mins. I would definitely go back to this hotel again.

<Content>We Loved The Innova! We absolutely LOVED our stay at the Innova. Its location was beneficial to us since we had to leave for Lourdes via Gare Montparnasse and it was just 5 minutes walk away. We were 5 travelling and asked for a twin and triple rooms, preferably with a view of the Eiffel tower. We were given a quadruple room and one of the rooms had a view of the Eiffel!! The people running this hotel are very considerate towards personal requests and in a city as impersonal as Paris, that is a PLUS! The rooms and bathrooms are clean, we didn't need airconditioning since April is a delightful month climate-wise. One of the really nice thing about the area is that there are so many boulangeries and food shops and it is not in a touristy area so you can see the locals do their thing everyday.The metro is just across the street and being newbies to Paris we didn't find it hard to use the subway at all. Everyone speaks English so no problem in that area. And since we had to leave for Lourdes~ their luggage storage facility is a bonus. All in all I would rate our stay at this hotel a 9+. Only the receiving area is old and needs to be refurbished. Otherwise, everything is great. We would stay there again and would gladly recommend the hotel to our friends.

<Content>good value and perfectly fine We stayed at the Hotel Innova for 2 nights in mid-February. We took the Air France bus from Charles DeGaulle to the Montparnasse train station and walked to the hotel (maybe a ten mnute walk?). The hotel is in a good, safe neighborhood and is a short block from the Pasteur Metro station. We took the Metro everywhere. We had two rooms: one with a double bed for me and my husband and one with twin beds for our two teenage daughters. Both rooms were small, but the twin room was a little bigger. The rooms and bathrooms were very clean (and I can be very picky about that kind of thing). The common areas of the hotel seemed a little worn, but were also very clean. The breakfast was good, but a little expensive. We had it both mornings because it was fast and easy. We ate dinner one night in the neighborhood, at a not-too-great pizza place, but there were many better options. I liked the neighborhood because it was not too touristy. It was fascinating to watch the real Parisians from the area hurrying to work in the morning. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Tidy and Tasty ! Two Star hotel located within a stones throw of Metro Pasteur. Close to Montparnesse. Small but comfortable double room which suited my wife and myself. Breakfast served up to 10.30am - friendly service from all staff. Ideal base to discover Paris. Close (15 min stroll) to La Coupole restaurant in Boulevard Montparnesse - well worth a visit also, but book in advance. Enjoy it.Excellent choice of eateries in locality - even right next store to Hotel.

<Content>Perfect for us Our stay at Hotel Innova was excellent. The double room we stayed in was small but perfect for my wife and I (both 27 years old). The room was clean and well maintained. We booked last minute via the hotel's website directly, which was very easy. The best part about staying at Hotel Innova is its proximity to the Pasteur metro stop. It made traveling around Paris a breeze. I would stay here again for future stays in Paris without hesitation. If you are looking for something simple, affordable with an excellent location, you should consider looking into this hotel.

<Content>Cheap and Cheerful Hotel Innova is a cheap and cheerful hotel in Paris. It was exactly what we were looking for - clean, centrally located and reasonably priced. The room we had was small, but comfortable. It was a 1 minute walk from Pasteur metro station - this was easily accessible from the Gare du Nord.It was located close enough distance from the tourist sites (10 mins to Invalides, 20 mins to Eiffel Tower etc), but with the charm of coming across local markets and parks on the way. What we liked was that it was a bit off the tourist track - there were lots of Parisiennes buying their bread, vegetables and meat from the local shops. We felt like we were experiencing the real Paris.There is a great cafe across the road (Cafe Pasteur) that does a great breakfast for 7.50 Euros - cheaper than the hotel.All in all it was great value for a two star hotel in Paris. We would totally recommend it to people wanting a nice weekend in Paris, but without breaking the budget on accomodation. Because how much time do you want to spend in your room in a city as fantastic as Paris anyway?!

<Content>Hotel Innova - A winner! Going to Paris for the first time i didnt know which hotel to book. Based on other reviews i choose Hotel Innova and was not dissapointed. Staff- Excellent!! Always helpful with sound advice on where to eat and where to visit. Rooms- Clean, tidy and cosy. I bit small but i assume everything is small unless you stay at the Hilton. Nice view also. Cost- Bargain!!Location- I really liked the location of the hotel. Right outside the Metro for trips into the city (10 mins). Walking distance to the Ivalides and Eifell tower. This hotel is not located in a 'touristy' area which is nice because you get a more 'local' experience. The nearby bars and restaurants are excellent!! Easy to get to from CDG.Overall- Fantastic!

<Content>For the price..... Let's face it, for the price your paying for a hotel in Paris it is probably a pretty good deal. My husband and I stayed in room 77 a double superior. It had one full size bed and one twin bed, a small t.v. and a what looked to be a newly remodeled bathroom. There were cracks in the walls paint, the wood on the window ledge was crumbling. The bedspread looked as if it came from the 70's on god knows when it was last washed. The edges of the entire bed spread were heavily frayed and filling was coming out of the sides. Once I was looking over our guidebook and got a bit chilly so I stupidly just shoved my legs under the bedspread and I had a rash for a week! You have to pay for the internet in the lobby, and if you use the A/C in your room. Our room had a view of the Eiffel Tower so for the price this was a good deal for me. But if I had a room without a view, I don't think I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Recommended We stayed here for 3 nights in January and would definately stay there again. The hotel was spotless, and the room looked recently redecorated. It wasn't a huge room, but by Paris standards it was plently big enough for 2.The breakfast unfornately wasn't buffet style, you sit down and there is already a plate with a croissant, small baguette and a pastry. A lady will bring you coffee, tea or chocolate. You can help yourself to cereal and yoghurt and juice. There is a metro opposite and its not far from the train station., about 5 minutes. There are loads of restaurants within 10 minutes walk. The area seems pretty safe too.Overall I was very happy with our stay here, the only reason I wouldn't stay again would be I would rather stay in a more central area.

<Content>Great Place to Stay We were very impressed with the staff, the room and the location! It is not fancy but has a charm about it. Jean Pierre who manages the front desk during the day is one of the most charming hotel managers we have every met. He gives five star service. He was able to direct us to good and reasonable places to eat. He always called ahead to make sure they were open. I would stay here again in a minute and I am very picky!

<Content>As promised! I booked a night in hotel Innova on the basis of Tripadvisor reviews and was not disappointed: exceedingly friendly staff, good breakfast for only 8 euro, perfect connections through two metro lines stopping in front of the hotel (Pasteur station), easy and lovely walk to Tour Eiffel and nearby museums. Room is small but well appointed, good bed, good shower, only bother was noise from neighbouring (bath)room. Certainly great value for money, as promised by the reviews. A practical solution for a short stay.

<Content>A Gem ! My teen daughter and I loved this hotel. We stayed for a week at the end of Oct./07. The place is really clean and the staff very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is a good start, fresh orange and grapefruit juices, fresh delicious rolls, croissants and baguette, corn flakes, jams, honey, emmental cheese ... it's buffet style but coffee, tea, or hot chocolate are served to you at your table. The location is quite convenient. The Pasteur subway station is right across the street. From Pasteur to Passy the train runs above ground. The 95 bus goes to St-Germain des-Pr茅s, the Louvre, and Op茅ra Garnier (direction Pte de Montmarte). The 70 bus goes to Ile de la Cit茅 (direction Hotel de Ville).We felt safe in the area even when returning past midnight. I would definatly return to this hotel.

<Content>A wonderful place! We stayed at this hotel for 4 days in September during the Rugby and found it to be in a wonderful location (about 50 metres from the Pasteur metro station), with a few great cafes in very close proximity. 3 stations from the eiffel tower - very easy to get around Paris. Rooms were comfortable and whilst not palatial, they were spacious enough with a good ensuite. Very clean, 24 hour internet access and very friendly and helpful staff. Highly recommended.

<Content>Cheap and cheerful Booked in this place for a Rugby World Cup game when the city was really booked up. This place is in a great location with great links on the metro. Rooms are basic but clean. I'd suggest spending a few extra euros on a double even if you are on your own . I had a great view of the Eiffel Tower from my window which was a bonus. Breakfast was fine, staff were friendly. Overall, for a couple of nights this place is fine.

<Content>Above average in Paris.Dont be thrown by only 2 stars I have been to Paris a number of times, stayed in Tonic Gare De Lyon and De Reuilly, Daumesnil. This hotel was cheaper tha both at 7h0 euro per night for a double room (booking.com)I as a little wary that it only had 2 stars but i was very pleasantly surprised!!I have no idea why it isnt a 3 star. The room was extremely clean and nicely decorated and much more spacious than the rooms n the other Paris hotels I have stayed in. The hotel itself is pretty and not at all grotty or run down and is righ in front of Pasteur metro stop. And best of all, a 5 min walk from Montparnasses with some lovely and affordable restaraunts. This was not a district i had been in before, i usually ate in Bastille but it was lovely. I have very little negative info about the hotel.Perhas the walls were alittle thin, we could hear next doors tv a lot but it really didnt bother us. All in all a gem and proof that budget doesnt have to mean grotty(it often does in Paris). I would reccomend this hotel to anone visiting paris on a budget or otherwise!

<Content>Great, clean, friendly little spot in Montparnasse Wow, we stayed at the Hotel Innova in the Montparnasse business district in Paris, and we loved it!It was very easy to get there from the Airport (you take the train, about eight euros, from the airport to the Metro, 1.25 euros, and then it was only a few stops on the #6 line to Pasteur station, and then just a few steps to the hotel)The manager of the hotel was exceptionally friendly, we had a nice room with a massive, clean and modern bathroom.The evening clerk was also very friendly and helpful.The room itself was small, but we didn't go there to sit in the room.It was very easy to walk to everywhere from there ... and if you don't like to walk, then the Metro is right there, and very easy to use.We loved it! We will stay at the Innova again!Vik

<Content>Great service -Great location My husband and I stayed for 12 days at the Hotel Innova in August 2007. We would stay there again.Pros: 1. Friendly and very helpful staff that speak very good English2. 24 hour internet service3. Excellent location as the hotel is located right at the metro station4. Numerous grocery stores, coffee shops, pastry shops and restaurants nearby5. Walking distance to many major sightseeing areas6. Excellent value for money -the rooms are small but you have your own bathroom and the rooms are clean and made up dailyCons:1. The bed was not the most comfortable, however clean 2. Not all rooms have air conditioning and if it is hot out, the room will be hot (however they all have balcony doors)3. Do not recommend the breakfast as for 8 Euros, you will get coffee and juice, a croissant and a bun.....there is a coffee shop right next door with very friendly service (also there is also another nice coffee shop across the street but some of the waiters tend to have the Paris attitude) However, for every cons one must remember that the price of the hotel for what you get is excellent. Would recommend this hotel to anyone and we would happily stay there again.

<Content>Excellent value We found this hotel through this website and due to the positive reviews and price stayed there in early July 2007.The hotel is easy to find (being opposite the Pasteur metro stop) and in a very pleasant and convenient location. You can get a good view of the Eiffel Tower by just walking a little way up the road and there are numerous restaurants and brasseries.While the hotel isn't really within walking distance of any of the main attractions, Pasteur metro stop is served by two lines, so it is very easy to get to anywhere in Paris. Inside the hotel, the foyer is very nice with internet access. We found the staff to be very helpful (booked a taxi for us to the airport) and English speaking. Our room was quite small and didn't have a nice view but was very clean. The maids came every day and changed the towels and bedding.The shower was excellent and there was plenty of wardrobe space. The weather wasn't particularly warm so the lack of air conditioning didn't affect us. In conclusion, for the price this is an excellent hotel to stay in whilst exploring Paris.

<Content>Exceeded our expectations I found this hotel on the website [-----] and kept going back to it, as I couldn't believe the nice things that other people were saying about it. It's a hostel that's been converted into a hotel, and afterpaying $150/night in Venice for an ancient room that hasn't been updated since it was built, I was scared to see what we'd end up within Paris for $100/night. Well, we got a private room with a private washroom on the 7th floor (yes, there's an elevator) with a view of the Arc d'Triomphe and the Sacre Couer in the distance. There was a TV, telephone and air conditioning (although we didn't use them) and there was a computer in the lobby that we used (2 Euros for 15 min; 3 Euros for 1/2 hour). The hotel is right across the street from the Pasteur Metro station so we went everywhere by Metro. Purchase a Carte Orange card - it costs 15 Euros and is good for all Metro and buses for an entire week. (The hotel staff will photocopy your passport picture for your photo ID). Breakfast isn't included, but there's a great creperie one block away. For the price, this hotel was perfect for this mother travelling with her teenaged daughter!

<Content>Great Views of the Eiffel Tower This hotel has amazing views of the Eiffel Tower and all you have to do to get a room with a view is to email them! They are very friendly and helpful and recommended many great places to eat. The hotel is centrally located and you need only to cross the street to catch a bus or walk a couple blocks for the rail.This paris hotel was great. Paris itself is overrated.

<Content>Simple and Affordable We stayed at the Hotel Innova the first week of July 2007. The room was a typical hotel European hotel room (smaller room, smaller bath, etc.) The location is not entirely convenient with relation to the major sites. However, if you enjoy walking, it might be ok, I would map it out first. There is a metro stop just outside the hotel which was great for us because after the first few days of walking to everything, we needed a break. The metro is a wonderful tool to navigate through Paris. It is very easy to use once you figure it out after a few times. If you plan on using the metro often, do yourself a favor and buy in bulk. We bought a 20-pack of metro tickets for 21.20 Euro (or there about) when a one-way ticket is 1.5 Euro each. Back to the hotel----house keeping was good. The sheets and towels were changed daily. There is an elevator in the hotel, so getting luggage upstairs was not a problem.We did have a room that faced the street which was quite noisy. However, after a long day of sight-seeing, falling asleep was not really a problem. Also, the windows were pretty sound-proof, but being that there is no air-conditioning, we had to keep the windows open. And don't get the breakfast at the hotel. It is 7 Euros per person. There are soooo many shops you will pass where you can buy delicious and fresh pastries for MUCH less---we would buy 4 croissants for about 2 or 3 Euro, for the two of us.

<Content>Great view of teh Eiffel Tower We stayed at the Hotel Innova for 5 nights in June. Three of us shared a triple room, which was a bit cramped with all our luggage (we had a lot of luggage).We were pleasantly surprised to have an excellent view of the Eiffel Tower from the top floor. (They only have a few rooms like that) We didn't order an airconditioned room but didn't need one in June (coming from a warm climate). The room was clean, and about average size for Paris. The bathroom was modern and a reasonable size for the price. The Day staff couldn't have been more helpful, but there was just one guy (who worked nights) who had an attitude. The breakfasts were good, but basic. The breakfast staff didn't speak English, but receptionists all spoke good English. It's in a nice enough part of Paris, and very handy for facilities. There is an excellent Patisserie across the street, and a good bar/ bistro at the corner just down from it (service was lightning speed). There is also a laundry about a block away. We tried most eateries in the area (including fast food) and didn't have any complaints). The crepes were beautiful. They have just one busy internet computer at the hotel, but there is an Internet cafe one street down towards the Pasteur Station (turn left and it's a couple of blocks). Watch out for the motorbike lane when crossing the Boulevard Pasteur !We'd stay there again.

<Content>Not so sure I liked this hotel! I read the reviews for this hotel, and honestly was a bit dissapointed upon arrival. While it is located next to the Pasteur metro station and an easy walk from the Gare Montparnasse and to the main attractions, I found the hotel lobby to be really grotty. We booked our room on Hostelworld.com and got a good price. The room however was a smoking room and it smelt really awful the whole night. The linen just reeked. The bed was pretty comfortable, but nothing special. It was 40 degrees and very hot in Paris and the room did not have a fan or air conditioning, which made it very hard to sleep. We stayed at Hotel de Suez in the latin quarter at the beginning of our trip and much preferred this place to Innova Hotel. I would not recommend for a romatic getaway!

<Content>Bon If you're looking for a relatively cheap place to stay in Paris, this hotel is as good a place to stay as any. Located just across the road from the Pasteur Metro station, it's minutes away from the main tourist attractions in Paris. The room we stayed in was clean and comfortable. At the end of the day, that's all you want. Why hang around in a hotel room when you're in the most exciting city in the world!

<Content>Oh La La We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in early June of 2007. The day staff were terrific and very helpful - the night staff were not so helpful and I must say bordering on the line of rude. The rooms were small but very clean, well maintained and recently redone. For the price - this is a terrific little hotel - well located - train station almost right in front of the door. I would go back.

<Content>Great Value for budget This review is a couple of months overdue now :) We stayed at the Innova in March 07. Well, we were looking for a budget hotel and did the bookings pretty much at the last minute. Considering that, this was a fairly decent hotel. Room was clean, very clean, warm and cosy. But yes, really small. The bathroom was tiny and rather amused us more than annoying. In retrospect i think it was cute :)  We also were able to see the top section of the eiffel tower from our room. And well at the end of a tiring day... it was pleasant indeed seeing the hourly lighting of the tower from the comfort of the bed! Never mind if this was not the entire view of the eiffel.The location is good. Many pattisseries around the hotel and the metro just a minute away. You can even walk to the eiffel... a pleasant and slow stroll took us about 25-30 mins to reach the tower, took the train on the way back. Invalides is again about 10-15 mins walk , and Gare Montparnesse a 5-10 min walk.. so yes the location is pretty good.From the airport we took the Air France bus, and well had quite some trouble finding the hotel. Its about 5-10 mins walk and we had to ask several people for directions before we made it to the hotel. Its not that difficult, just that we still didnt have a map. Bought one immediately as soon as the shops opened :)Well for the price, i think its a good deal. Would i stay here again- well if we were on budget - yes definitely. If not - perhaps not.Having said that, nothing takes away the magic of paris. This was our first time to Paris and one of the most romantic trips ever. well..not the last in paris for sure :)

<Content>Nice little Hotel This hotel is located close to the Montparnasse railroad station.Our double-room was quite small but very clean and newly furnitured. The bathroom is the minimum size, what you would expect from a hotel of that category. Our room was quiet and we even could see some meters of the top of the Eiffel-Tower from our window!!! Staff is extraordinarly friendly and speaks English very well.The next underground-station is one minute, Gare Montparnasse about 5 minutes away. The nicest area of this district with its cinemas and restaurants can be reached in 7-10 minutes by walking. I would recommand this hotel to everyone who needs a place to stay for less than 100鈧?/ night. Don't expect some flair our anything special, it's a two-star-hotel.

<Content>Great Little Hotel Hotel Innova is a great hotel and doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't. I stayed there with a friend in May 2007 and although it's not the luxurious surrroundings you might want for a stay in Paris, it is excellent value for a very good price.Room was clean and spacious, staff were very helpful, towels changed and beds made everyday, tasty breakfast, Metro stop just across the road and a quiet location. I'd definitely go there again on the same budget.We had a very busy and enjoyable few days and this hotel was great to come back to after a hard days sightseeing. I can highly recommend the Cafe Pasteur across the road as well for a croque monsieur and a cold beer!

<Content>Pleasant stay in Paris The Hotel Innova had wonderful members of staff at the front desk. They were very helpful and the bowl of candy was always visited. They did everything possible to help us, even writing a note for us to obtain train tickets (since we didn't speak French) and letting us leave our bags there after our check out time so we could explore the city some more. We had two rooms, one was very lovely with an amazing bathroom including towel warmer and bathtub. The other was much smaller and smelled badly as if it had just been painted. Considering it was Paris though and we were out and about almost all day, that wasn't too much of a problem. The friendliness of the staff more than made up for the stinky room, and this was a very nice hotel to stay at.

<Content>Decent Hotel But Far From A High Class Paris Experience Just stayed 4 nights at the Hotel Innova on a business trip that allowed plenty of free time for Paris sightseeing. I found this hotel through the positive reviews on Trip Advisor.While I have no particular complaints about the hotel, let's keep it in perspective. The location is near a Metro stop (Pasteur) which is about 15 minutes to Concorde and about 10 minutes to the Convention Center. Not bad. There is very little to see or do near the hotel although it is about a 10-15 minute walk to the restaurants of Montparnesse.The rooms are about typical for a European business hotel which means it is rather small by U.S. standards. Those accustomed to a hotel as basic as a Marriott Courtyard or a Hampton Inn will think those are luxury hotels compared with the Innova. The double bed is actually two single beds pushed together and while the mattress was not terrible, nobody should think they are getting anything like what they would get in a typical U.S. chain hotel. There was a TV in the room but it could not have been more than about a 12 inch screen (not that you come to Paris to watch TV).The rate paid was around 鈧?0.00 per night making this hotel an excellent value for a business traveler or a budget traveler. If you are on vacation or a honeymoon and want a memorable romantic/Parisian experience you should try to find a good deal at one of the better hotels in a different part of the city as there is nothing at all romantic about this 2 star property.

<Content>Nice little hotel We stayed at the Innova for two nights in March. The hotel is in a good location with a metro stop just across the road. The staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful and were happy to give directions and make recommendations. Although the furniture in the lobby and public areas was a little tatty the rooms were clean and we had a view of the Eiffel Tower from our window. Good value for money and we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great little hotel Our visit to Paris was unfortunately too short, however our stay at Hotel Innova was absolutely perfect for the trip. We stayed in a Triple room; this was a bit small for a family of four but the room was very clean and tidy (housekeeping each morning). The shower had really good pressure, and we had an absolutely fabulous view of the Eiffel Tower from the bedroom window, - this was a real bonus!The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was not included, but we ended up paying extra because it was more convenient (especially with two young children). The food was served by staff which we thought was done very nicely for a two star hotel. Croissants and breadrolls were served with freshly squeezed juice and hot beverages (extra servings were given if required, at no extra costs).Parking the car on the opposite side of the street was extremely annoying as we had to circle the block repeatedly to find the privately -owned carpark (this turned out to be in a more obvious location than we had initially thought). We parked our car there for three days (sunday- free parking on the side-streets) and used the Metro to go sightseeing. This was done with ease as the Metro is immediately across from the hotel. However if you're on a low budget, a 20-30 minute walk following the Metro line will take you to the Eiffel Tower too.All in all, a GREAT hotel for the price and location. Vietnam, Australia, The Netherlands.

<Content>Great Choice I stayed at the Hotel Innova for four nights in Feb, 2007. I chose it based in large part on Trip Advisor reviews, and I was very pleased. The rather tired looking furniture in the lobby didn't do justice to my brightly painted guest room, which looked as though it had been recently redone. The room was cheerfully appointed and immaculately clean. While the bathroom was small, the fixtures (shower only -- no tub) appeared new and everything was in excellent condition. There was plenty of hot water and the water pressure was great. The bed was even pretty comfortable, and the sheets were always crisp and clean. My room looked out over Boulevard Pasteur, which would be a bit noisy for sleeping with the window open. Obviously this wasn't a concern in February, but it might be in the summer, as I didn't note any evidence of a/c in my room. The walls were fairly thin, as I could hear my friend's voice from the neighboring room, but happily, the hotel was always quiet at night, and my sleep was never disturbed.I availed myself of the breakfast on a couple of mornings. At 8 Euros, it might seem pricey at first, but if you compare the cost of coffee anywhere else, it's actually a pretty good deal. You get unlimited coffee refills, along with bread, pastry, jam, cheese, cereal,  juice. There is a Metro stop on the same block, which makes this location a standout. There are also some decent places to eat nearby -- the cafe on the corner (turn left when you exit the hotel) seemed to be the neighborhood place where everyone knows your name, and the food was quite good -- try the cassoulet for some traditional French comfort food.The hotel offers one internet station in the lobby; cards start at 2 Euros for 15 minutes. The daytime front desk staff was very accommodating and efficient, and language was never a barrier, as all spoke excellent English.I was completely pleased with the hotel, thought it was a terrific value (I paid 80 Euros for a room with a double bed), and I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>A nice trip to Paris Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Hotel Innova. It is ideally situated, being only a minute away from a metro station (Pasteur). The Eiffel Tower and Les Invalides are in easy walking distance. The hotel isn't luxurious but it is clean. The rooms are fairly small but sufficient and the hotel staff are friendly and speak reasonable English. I would recommend staying here if you require a good convenient hotel to explore Paris.

<Content>The reviews are right Myself and my boyfriend went to paris for 4 nights. We choose this hotel due to the reviews it received. We booked a superior room on the 7th floor 400e for both of us for 4 nights. The staff were lovely. The man on reception advised us to go to lavel restaurant which is only across the street and up the road. If you say you are staying in Hotel innova you get a glass of kir champagne free! (its 9.50e on menu. I have to sing the praises of a restuarant only doors down from the hotel 'manger la salle' something like that, but a 3 course meal is only 19e it is wonderful and the man running the place is so nice. I cant understand why people gave out about the lift it is bright mirror lined and modern. Fab FAB fab hotel hopefully going back in the sringtime. Great location you dont realise how good it is to have a metro station across the road until you get over there, i want to take the paris metro back home to Ireland.

<Content>Great Place To Stay We stayed for two nights at Hotel Innova. My fiance and I were doing a 6 week trip of Europe. This hotel was great. The location was awesome, it was about 2 stops (on the metro) away from the Eiffel Tower. The stop to catch the metro was literally across the street. It was clean and the staff were friendly. While we were staying in Paris we had decided to book two nights at Hotel Innova and stay the other two nights in the neighbouring city of Versailles. The hotel we stayed in , in Versailles was a $900.00 dollar a room night (we wanted to live the high life and rough it a little while we were visiting here). The expensive hotel had a cockroach in it. Definatly for your dollar you will not be dissapointed with Hotel Innova! We wish we had stayed at Innova all four nights.The hotel was also great for people of all ages, young and old. If you want to party though this might not be the hotel for you as it is quiet. Happy travelling.!!!!!If you have any questions feel free to email me at suga_baybee77@hotmail.com

<Content>Great hotel, great location Spent only one night. Great value for money in a great location. As others have said double rooms on the small side but you are in Paris. Staff more than helpful. Recommended.

<Content>Great little hotel My girlfriend and I have just returned from Hotel Innova after staying for four nights. We trusted other traveller's reviews and we were not dissapointed. The hotel is small and charming. Our room was surprisingly big for european standards and definately very clean. The hotel's location is what we enjoyed the most. Located just across from metro station Pasteur, the entire city is easy to access. Our first night we walked to the Eiffel tower in less than half an hour after our eight hour flight. The Latin quarter and saint germain are also very close. The area is quiet at night which we enjoyed after a long day of walking and crowds. The hotel is located near Gare Montparnasse which is literally a ten minute walk to the hotel. From CDG airport you can take the Air France bus for 14 euros each to the station and be at the hotel in no time. If you purchase a round trip ticket it is 22 euros each.  Just outside the hotel the are beautiful restaurants and cafes in every direction. We found a fabulous restaurant named Bistro de Breteuil on rue Breteuil right in front of the Invalides. The meal and ambiance were definately the best we experienced in Paris. The hotel was amazing and there was not one complaint with anything. We will definately stay at the Hotel Innova next time in Paris!

<Content>Great place to stay Hotel Innova, Paris.We stayed at the Innova for three nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. We had a third floor front room with en-suite, and although our accommodation was fairly compact it suited our needs perfectly. The bedroom consisted of a double bed, wardrobe, two small tables with two chairs, and the en-suite was fitted with a powerful shower instead of a bath 鈥?which suited us just fine. In addition there was a colour TV and hair dryer provided. Our room had a small balcony that overlooked the main street; the access to the balcony was via a pair of new upvc double glazed French windows, which in turn were covered by drapes. Considering our room was at the front we weren鈥檛 really bothered by any traffic noise, it just seemed to be part of the normal background ambience. However, for an extra cost there are rooms available at the rear away from the main road for anyone wishing for that extra bit of piece and quiet!The room was cleaned and serviced daily to a high standard and we found most of the staff to be helpful and friendly, especially the French gentleman (I think he may have been the manager) who was on duty in the mornings. The location of this hotel was excellent, in the immediate vicinity there are plenty of shops of all descriptions including cafes, bars, restaurants, supermarkets, pharmacies etc. Just over the road from the hotel is Pasteur Metro, which in turn links you up to anywhere within the city. Most times we would walk to the major attractions located alongside the river and enjoy the unexpected sights along the way. An easy stroll to the Invalides or the Eiffel Tower would take about 15/20 minutes. The whole area around the hotel felt safe and there wasn鈥檛 any sense of aggression or intimidation even later on in the night, in fact we found most of Paris to be the same. We didn鈥檛 really have any complaints considering we were staying in Paris in a low cost two star hotel 鈥?although a very good two star! Okay, the bathroom was a bit small but if you want a huge apartment you have to be prepared to spend a lot more and we found it perfectly adequate anyway. I guess it would have been just right if the room was fitted with a small fridge in order for us to store drinks etc. but that is only a minor fault. As an afterthought, if we stayed again at this time of year (July) and the weather was just as hot I think I would spend the extra few Euros for a room with air-con; as it was, we just left the balcony window open 鈥?no problems. Next time we visit Paris we would definitely stay there again, and recommend the Innova to like minded travellers who just need a base to rest and recuperate while enjoying this marvellous city.

<Content>Great Place to Stay We stayed at Hotel Innova for 4 nights at the end of June. My husband and I shared a family room with our 2 daughters, our first trip to Paris. We were really pleased with the hotel, which we had chosen over the Internet, with help from Trip Advisor. It's in a very good location, with an underground stop right outside, cafe's all around, supermarkets, etc. We had a wonderful time in Paris! Would definitely stay in this hotel again. One tip for future tourists - bring along some little plastic bowls and some cutlery sets, get food at the local supermarkets, and you'll save a lot of money and have fun picnicing in the bargain.

<Content>loved it me and my husband travelled through italy and france last month, and this hotel was my favourite amongst all the places we stayed at...for starters, its a hotel room for the price you would pay for 2 beds in a hostel dorm...the rooms are very clean, and the bathroom , private..:)...the rooms also have a small balcony, with huge bay windowsthe staff is very helpful, and the hotel very conveniently located...so if you are in paris, and feel like seeing the eiffel tower (15 mins walk) everyday of your stay, Innova it is..:)the hotel can organize airport shuttle for you, so if you dont want to change trains on your way back to the airport, its fine...though the hotel is right across the street from the pasteur stop...in paris, especially on a saturday, pack a picnic basket with breads, rose wine, candles and a guitar and head for the eiffel tower...for an evening you ll never forget...and dont worry if you think you re not the sorts, paris will make you wanna..:)

<Content>Great Little Hotel I stayed at this hotel from May 24-27 and I really enjoyed my experience there. The staff was welcoming and very friendly. Prior to my stay I emailed them and requested a specific type of room. A member of staff quickly responded and my wish was granted. Overall the hotel is neat and well-kept and I would definitely stay there again.The hotel requies that you leave your room key at reception whenever you leave for an extended period. Be forewarned that there aren't any non-smoking rooms. The staff does a great job of cleaning but if you have an overly sensitive nose the smell of cigarettes might be a problem. My room was fine and I couldn't tell whether previous guests had smoked or not.The hotel offers breakfast every morning from (7:30-10:30) at a charge of 鈧?. I never tried the breakfast so I can't comment on whether it's good or not. Instead, my friend and I chose to visit the local bakeries and grocery stores for breakfast-a cheaper option.The hotel also provide internet access. However, there is only one computer...sometimes there is a line. You can purchase a card to access the internet from reception. The cards are offered on the following basis: 15 minutes 鈧?, 30 minutes 鈧?, and one hour at 鈧?.What I liked most about the hotel is the location. As previous reviewers have said, the hotel is directly across the street from the Pasteur metro stop. Pasteur is serviced by lines 612. Also, there is a taxi stand across the street so if traveling my metro is not your thing taxis are easily available.The hotel is within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower, Invalides, the Rodin Museum, and the Montparnasse Tower. You can get to all those places within 15-20 minutes walking. In the immediate area there are plenty of restaurants, bakeries, and pharmacies. Across the street there is a Banque Populaire Rives de Paris across the street so getting Euros is never a problem.There is a high school about a block away from the hotel so you may see lots of teenagers early in the morning and again in the early afternoon.Pari Roller rolls through the neighborhood on Friday nights (around 10PM) so if you like to see hundreds of people on rollerblades this is for you.

<Content>Very nice hotel, nice staff, great location Me and my gf suppose to stay 4 nights in this hotel, but at the end it was only 3 because our flight from Prague to Paris was cancelled and we had to spend one night in Prague instead. I did lots of searching and reading reviews and finally i decided for this hotel.I am glad we have chosen this one. Nice rooms, staff was great, great location, only 20 mins walk from Eiffel Tower, metro is right outside the hotel. We stayed on the top floor and had a nice view of the city and the Eiffel Tower.We did not eat the breakfast as we wanted to try the local caffees. We stayed 3 nights and payed only 180 Euros wchich is very nice for this place and location. When we will travel to Paris again, we will stay this place for sure. I would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Great hotel, perfect location We spend a week in Paris last October and Innova Hotel seems to be one of the best options in low budget hotels. A perfect location, you just have to cross the street to be in Pasteur Metro Station. Near from restaurants, boulangeries, shops and about half mile from Eiffel Tour. Rooms are small, but comfortable and clean. It's perfect to rest and sleep, not to spend time inside (you're not in Paris to stay in the room !). Breakfast is perfect : 3 types of bread, juice, yogurt, butter and the best : you can eat and drink as much as you can and want. Staff is nice and prestative.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great location Group of 12 family members stayed here during our 4 day trip to Paris, 8 adults and 4 children plus 1 baby. Lovely and clean hotel and very well located to tourist spots. Lots of patisseries nearby and nice restaurants. Air France bus from Paris CDG stops at Gare Montparnasse (10 mins walk). Lovely service and very enjoyable stay had by all. Staff speak good english and maids very pleasant. Room with balcony and boulevard view recommended, view out of quadruple room not brilliant.

<Content>Good for the money We stayed at the Hotel Innova in July 2005. The room was adequate but small. There is no air-conditioning so we had to leave the windows open most of the time. This wasn't a problem unless we were trying to sleep. The hotel is located on a busy street and so is too noisy to leave the windows open at night. Breakfast is served at the hotel for an additional price of 7 Euros per person. We never ate at the hotel and instead visited one of the many pastry shops each morning. It was delicious and much less expensive (5 Euros for both of us). The location is fairly good. We walked to most of the main tourist attractions, but unless you really enjoy walking, you may want to take the metro. The staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful. They made us feel welcome and gave us useful information during our stay. Over all, I would recommend staying here. It was a good value for the money.

<Content>Great value for money We were a big family group and stayed in the hotel for 1 night on July 22, 2005. Everything was very well managed. We arrived at 1PM and our rooms were ready. We had booked 2 rooms - a double and a triple - but since the triple was for some reason not available we were given 3 double rooms for the same price. The booking had been made over the internet. The rooms and baths were clean, the towels and linen were fresh, the lift was good sized, and the service was very helpful. Internet was available at 5 euros an hour beside the check-in desk. The car parking across the street for 10 euros a day was secure and convenient. The Eiffel Tower and Champs Elysee were within walking distance. Overall we were very satisfied and will return again.
