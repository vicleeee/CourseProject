<Content>A Faded Star In Need of Redecoration the room we had was a bit jaded but the concept of a minimalist style hotel with an eastern influence still works well. The location is satisfactory and is in good proximity to Gaudis main works but is probably a 15 minute walk to Las Ramblas and Barri Gothic which while not excessive is perhaps a little further than idealWe did not dine at the hotel but enjoyed our stay - not quite up to expectation as it is all a little bit worn

<Content>Excellent Hotel The Prestige is an excellent hotel in an excellent location. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious, bathroom slightly dated but very clean. The room was at the front of the hotel, and unlike some reviews I have read, noise from the main road was not a problem. There was a free mini-bar and safe in the room. We didn't try the breakfast in the hotel as we thought 19Euro each was a bit pricey and it wasn't as though you struggle finding somewhere nearby for breakfast. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great experience We spent our honeymoon in Barcelona and were more then pleased with the Prestige Paseo De Gracia. The location is hard to beat, the staff very friendly and welcoming. The ambience of the hotel including its rooms is modern, minimalistic and pleasantly stylish. The modern take on design does not come at the expense of functionality though - all the amenities one would expect from a hotel in this category are there. I found it to be a little oasis of calmness after coming back from a busy day in this exiting, bustling metropolis. Little details like the free Minibar (refilled every day), fast and free wireless Internet access and international newspapers delievered to our room daily at no additional expense added a nice touch of comfort. At the time of our stay the hotel offered four room categories: Functional, Executive, Superiour and Junior Suite. We stayed in a room of the second category. Personally I would not choose the Functional room - those rooms are smaller and offer no view.

<Content>Great Little Hotel, Fantastic Location We are just back from a 3 night stay at this hotel and can highly recommend it. This was our first visit to Barcelona and were delighted with the location, close to all the major sights with great shopping on the doorstep. The reception is small but very smart and the staff very polite and welcoming. We stayed in room 501 which had a large split level private terrace with great views across Passeig de Gracia (did have double glazed doors that shut out any street noise so was also very peaceful). The room itself was simply decorated with huge, very comfy bed, flat screen tv and quite nice bathroom. I would have given this 5 stars and they are obviously trying really hard but there were a few shabby edges that let it down when you looked closely, such as wardrobe doors that kept jamming, towel rail/glass shelving unit that hung precariously so you kept thinking it was going to collapse every time you grabbed a towel and a bit of a mad paint job in the bathroom - looks like they have painted over nice slate tiles with jet black paint and perhaps the only important thing - a not very good shower. Having said that, we would go back and even ask for he same room. We booked direct on the hotel's website and got a great rate (500 euros in total). This included a free mini bar every day of water, juices, sodas, a couple of beers and some chocolate plus buffet breakfast which was very nice. The Ask Me concierge service was wonderful - really knowlegable staff with honest recommendations for sightseeing and eating out. All in all great value and location and nice enough room - the terrace won us over!! Also highly recommend a close-by tapas restaurant Cerveceria Catalana on Calle de Mallorca - we had some good food in Barcelona but this was the tastiest!

<Content>Excellent location on a budget This small budget hotel is not to be confused with the Prestige Paseo de Gracia. With the sad state of the dollar, this budget hotel offers a small, pretty clean room with decent towels and a good size bathroom. Our street side room had very little noise for being in such a major street. The location is unbeatable. The hotel personnel is helpful and friendly.

<Content>Loved tha Prestige I booked this hotel for a city break , I was not too sure if I was going to like it because the photos of the rooms in the hotel website where not very good in my opinion ,but I have to say that when I saw the room I was happily surprised. The room was spacious and had a balcony to the paseo de gracia ,despite the traffic if the balcony's door was closed there was no noise at all. It was my birthday the day we arrived (24/5) and we went out ,when we came back we found a bottle of cava and a bowl with strawberries and cranberries with a note saying happy birthday !!!I found the staff very helpful and when we asked someone in the ASk me service they always did as much as they could to help us or find what we wantedThe location was also great as it was only 7 min from Plaza de CataloniaI would go back to this hotel if I decide to go for a short break to Barcelona.

<Content>Lovely Prestige Paseo de Gracia We stayed here last week for 4 nights. This is a boutique hotel right on the Paseo de Gracia that is absolutely wonderful. The location is excellent and you can walk almost everywhere. The Ask Me Concierge people were so helpful in every way. I had emailed and ask for a car pick up and Paola arranged everything. When we arrived she made sure she knew who we were and gave us wonderful recommendations for places to go. Then she made suggestions for tapas and dinner and made reservations. All the recommendations were superb and delicious. The whole staff could not do enough for us. All the rooms have free WiFi and the mini bar is all free. Because we booked online our breakfast was included. We stayed in room 501. It had a beautiful balcony and overlooked the Paseo. We definitely did not have enough time in Barcelona and plan to return as soon as possible. We definitely will stay at this hotel again and again. An excellent value.

<Content>The Best Ever Please, please, stay here!!! You will not be disappointed at all. Okay, yeah, the rooms are small, but this hotel is wonderful. Great location, great staff -- especially the personal travel/concierge person they have. Also, they sometimes provide complimentary breakfast when you book online and it is very much worth it. They had these little salami sandwiches, rubbed with olive oil and tomato and garlic, yummmmy! The hotel is romantic too, nice bathrooms, and in a great location. We stayed for 8 days and each day we enjoyed breakfast, and their complimentary coffee. I can't say enough about this hotel, especially if you are like us and like the boutique hotels.

<Content>Wonderful stay in a great neigborhood! My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon before going on a Mediterranean cruise. What a great choice! First off, we were not looking for the goofy honeymoon suite with a silly lip- or heart-shaped tub - we were more into seeing and doing on our trip while relaxing in the evenings and sleeping in late. So, first off, all the staff in the hotel were very kind and helpful. Thierry helped us with our bags and was very helpful with some places to eat late night since we didn't arrive until about 10:30pm, but then again, that's normal dinner time for Barcelona, eh? The ask me service guy was awesome, too (sorry I can't remember his name right now - Stefan, maybe?), but he was truly great - provided many maps and options for getting around/touring no matter what your tastes are. The hotel itself is in a great location - not very far from a dropoff point at Placa Catalunya from the airport shuttle. The location is close to a couple Gaudi apt. blocks - including Casa Batllo. There are great restaurants nearby, but we really liked eating in the Born district - cool part of town not too far away via either Metro or bus. The room was made out in a Mod style - very nicely done. Room was quiet, bed was nice and big and comfy which pleased us. It was also low in case that is a concern - it did not bother us (we liked it), but elderly folks might care about it. The room was spacious, had a nice view of the paseo and nice, mod bathroom with both a stand alone shower and a separate bathtub. I will agree with other posts that the lighting system is odd, but Thierry helped us out with it upon entry. It's nothing to be concerned with - it's just not the normal on/off switch, but it actually works pretty well to suit your dimming/lighting needs and to save energy.The breakfast options were AWESOME here and we loved the style of the hotel. We didn't think the lift (elevator) was loud at all and we didn't hear a peep from anyone else. In fact, I think we may have only seen 1 or 2 other guests while staying here. We had the best time, felt very comfortable, and the staff were very helpful and kind! Great place! We would definitely come back!Also, if you're not in command of your Spanish, not to worry, everyone there speaks very good English and I believe French as well. The pictures that have been submitted are quite accurate.Wonderful hotel with a great view, great staff, and great location at a great deal!

<Content>3 Night Stay Oct 07 Stayed two nights in room 410 (Superior Room) located at the rear of the hotel, which was nice and quite. Yes the lights are quirky to operate, but used correctly they can create a lovely ambiance in the room, a good tip is to ask the doorman who brought our bags up to run through how they operate. We booked our stay through the hotels website this entitled us to inclusive breakfast which was delicious and had some thing for all tastes. The whole vibe of the hotel was calmness, which was perfect after a long day of sightseeing around the city. We used the Ask Me concierge for recommendations to eat for each night of out stay. They came up with the following El Tragaluz, - 5-minute walk (good selection of Meat, Fish, and Catalan food), - Botafumerio 2 stops on the metro (traditional fish restaurant with fish platters etc. but if you don鈥檛 like fish don鈥檛 bother. Hisop 20 minute walk: - modern Catalan restaurant, fabulous food we had 6 course tasting menu - 49 euros cannot praise this restaurant enough, the quality of the food along with the service, wine recommendations, were outstanding.

<Content>Uncomfortable furnishings, Great Location This hotel was furnished with the eye toward contemporary design but not comfort. The bar area sofas were very uncomfortable as were the lounge chairs on our patio(Try to sit in one with out sliding off!) Also there were no drawers for clothing. I used one of the sofas in our sitting room to store clothes. Bathrooms were nice and well appointed. Free minibar was well stocked. Rooms were large and beds were very comfortable.ASK ME service was the best concierge service we had while in Spain. They were very helpful and we enjoyed all of their suggestions.Hotel location was great...we walked almost everywhere.

<Content>Disappointing We use TA as our bible and were encouraged by the reviews of this hotel. As usual many of the comments are totally bang on, especially.. Excellent Concierge Ask Me service Excellent Location Noisy LiftBut..We booked rm602 (the meeting suite) not 502 as everyone seems to suggest. Its one of their 2 suites (above rm 502 we overlooked their terrace) at front. We got over the complicated light switches but couldn't cope with the poorly maintained bathroom. Our shower didn't leak but only partially worked. The overhead shower head dribbled out ok but no power shower, but the handheld didn't work and the tap had come out of the wall. The sliding doors between the bathroom and bedroom always jammed stuck. This was very irritating.We are family of 3 and booked the suite thinking it would be big enough for our daughters bed. It wasn't really - being just a big room with wonderful glass windows overlooking street. Fine for a couple not for family.When does a room become a suite ? I always thought that a suite was more than one room but obviously not.The concierge was excellent - making bookings giving advice etc. The rest of the staff were good looking but useless. The pretty boy who waited breakfast should stay on the beach. The doormen in the silly hats more concerned with how they look than looking after you.So you don't think this review is wasted I'll give you 2 non-touristy places to eat. Modern tapas at Paco Meralgo (carrer de muntaner) and where they still treat tourists as interesting guests and for lunch (excellent fish) L'Oliv茅 (balmes 47).The food at both these places is very good.

<Content>Loved this hotel! We stayed here for 3 days as part of a 2 week trip through Europe and this was by far the highlight. We booked a standard room and when we arrived at 7am, we were greeted by a friendly staff who had a room ready for us. For a standard, the room was very spacious, especially by European standards. The room and bathroom were very moder, clean, and had all the amenities one could ask for, including the mini bar filled with free beverages and a couple of snacks. We loved the city and this hotel was the perfect location to explore every major site by foot. We will definitely visit this beautiful city again and when we do, we will be staying at the Prestige Paseo de Gracia!

<Content>A great hotel. This is a lovely hotel. We booked a 'superior' room through their website - the room and the hotel as a whole was stylishly decorated - in a very comfortable way - clean, with no signs of wear and tear at all. Our room on the 5th floor had a 18 foot, bi-level 'terrace' (not to be confused with a balcony - as the man who checked us in informed us!) with stone floors, loungers and a table which, overall, had to be seen to be believed. Granted, the lighting system is confusing at worst but a fun quirk at best. Huge, comfortable bed and huge, high resolution plasma screen on the wall. Bathroom does get a little wet when showering but this does not leak through to the living quarters.All staff were friendly and helpful - also the 'Ask Me' guy was refreshingly frank about some of our more dubious restaurant choices from our guide book (naughtily we checked them out anyway on the first night and he was 100% correct). Good value for money - plus booking through their website gives you free breakfasts throughout your stay - and the breakfasts are good enough that I can recommend taking them up on the offer (the minibar is also free). If you like smaller, boutique-style hotels, this is of the highest quality and comes highly recommended.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel in an Excellent Location My wife and I decided on The Prestige based on reviews we had read on this web site and I must tell you that we were not disappointed. The hotel is very conveniently located on the train route from the airport so once you come out of the station, the hotel is right in front of you. The reception staff are professional and very helpful. The Ask Me service is beyond reproach and the rooms are functional and very comfortable. The bonus is that the mini bar contents are free of charge. We stayed for one night and our room did not have view but when you are jet lagged and tired a comfortable bed and great shower and attendant amenities like shower gel etc is all the doctor ordered. On the return to Singapore we stayed again and this time they gave us a room with a terrace over looking the Paseo de Gracia.We would highly recommend the hotel to any first time visitors to Barcelona. its a mere 15 minutes walk from the Sagrada, a 5 minute walk to the Gaudi Residences and amazing shops and tapas bars.Mohajers

<Content>Loved it, but not for everyone Ultra boutique hotel in an excellent location between two Gaudi buildings and just steps from a Metro station with both subway and rail system out of town. Yes, the room gets some getting used to, especially the lighting system. We found it to be funny. The shower does drip on the floor, but the candle and incense make up for it. The Zeroom concierge staff is GREAT!!!! Friendly, willing to chat, helpful, and well informed. We just totally fell for each of them and their charm. Free wi-fi, friendly staff, and top location. The breakfast was elegant and includes cava. We received a free newspaper every morning. Our only complaint is that we asked for a front terrace three months before our stay and received a room facing the back. Sigh. Overall, know what you're getting into and you will be satisfied. This is not a European Westin, or the Hotel Majestic. We loved it.

<Content>Great location, variable quality. I booked 2 rooms recently for a 4 day stay with the family. Rooms contrast greatly in quality and comfort. My wife and I stayed in room 502, which is probably the best they have. Excellent Zen inspired terrace, jaccuzi, etc etc. Kids stayed in one of the back rooms. Terrible. However, lift (elevator) noise is a real issue no matter which room.We found staff to be helpful and attentive, no problems at all other than the Zeroom staffing could do with better English given that this sounded to be the native tongue of almost all guests when we were there.Location of the hotel is probably the key reason to stay here. Central to all the main areas and walking distance to many of the better restaurants and shops.Would stay here again only if we were assured of specific room.

<Content>Form over Function! A friend and I recently spent six horrible days at the Prestige.Paseo de Gracia. Billed as sleek and modern, its high-tech form sadly precedes any semblance of function--that is to say customer comfort. We stayed in the Superior Double at $330. This undersized room and bath with insufficient closet and storage space for two people travelling lightly was equiped with a high-tech amenities including a lighting system that required a PhD engineer to operate. For example, you turned off the lights and the window curtain closed whether you liked it or not.Speaking of the curtain, upon arrival Day 1 and badly needing a siesta, the curtain wouldn't close. The supposed customer-oriented staff shrugged this off and told us a technician would come some time in the afternoon. We chose to stay away from the hotel until 18h only to find the problem unresolved. Finally, after a number of angry phone calls, the general manager arrived at 21h with the tecnician. He claimed he'd just learned of the problem. There are only 45 rooms in the hotel.It was downhill from there. The manager left his card and told us to email if we had any other requests. I did mail him and he never responded. The next day, the room wasn't cleaned but someone left a note saying they'd been there and didn't want to disturb us! Good form, no function.The hair dryer was conveniently affixed inside a closet next to the safe in an unlit entry. The terrace view included clothes lines and air conditioners. The shower leaked and the bath stopper was broken. The exit door handle on our floor came off in my hand and wasn't repaired during our stay. The elevator noise was unbearable at night. Despite a hotel filled with English and Americans, the only english language TV was CNN. The buffet breakfast was over-rated and over-priced. In addition, the hotel staff gave us the evil eye during our entire stay beause of my complaint.I could go on but it would only remind me of the $2000 wasted on this experience. If I could find something positive to say, it is that the hotel is centrally located near a lovely neighborhood.

<Content>Great time in Barcelona Just returned from four days at the Prestige Paseo de Gracia. This is an elegant, boutique type hotel (45 rooms) in a fabulous location on Passig de Gracia. The metro/train station is just outside the door, Las Ramblas was about a 10-15 minute walk. Plenty of shopping and interesting restaurants nearby. The desk staff were very helpful. This was our first trip to Barcelona so we had lots of questions which is why we found the two gentlemen who worked in the ASKMe service so helpful. Alvaro (hope I spelled that right) even helped us with some arrangements before we arrived at the hotel. We also made frequent use of the free internet service provided in the Zeroom. We booked our room on the hotel website and therefore our breakfast was included in the price. The breakfast was exceptional (much better than what we had in Madrid) with delicious fruits, yogurts, meats, sweets and fresh juice. Another nice touch were the free sodas, beers and candy available in the minibar. The room was rather small and the bathroom was downright tiny. However, the bed was super comfy and a joy to retire to at the end of a long day. With all these pluses, we did have a couple of problems. This is a smoke free hotel, however, our room smelled of smoke. Since the hotel was full our only resort was air freshener and opening the windows. This did help but nonetheless, I continued to smell smoke off and on in the room and definitely in the hallways. We had some problems with our toliet which they attended to immediately but it never did work properly. Despite these glitches, we enjoyed our stay here. The ambiance, personal touches and excellent location made up for the minor problems.

<Content>A super hotel! Super location, very friendly staff and management and a super lounge with internet access and an 'uber concierge' system so you get the personal touch too. The only slight snag was that our check in was delayed - the room was not ready at 5.15pm - but when pressed the hotel manager was most sympathetic and gave us the extra time we asked for on the day of check out. The beds , pillows, etc are super comfortable and no outside noise due to very good glazing. Very good a/c, and in room music, tv and toiletries added a nice homely touch. The airport - bound bus is a block away. Gaudi's 2 major apt buildings are right there and there is a direct bus to Parc Guell. We could not have asked for more in a hotel.

<Content>Excellent location and staff We stayed at the Prestige for 3 nights dutring our honeymoon and loved it. The location was excellent and the Ask Me Service was so helpful. Alvaro from the service recommended our 2 favorite restaruants from our whole trip: Con Gracia and El Nou Ramonet. Both delicious and great experiences. We would highly recommend the hotel!

<Content>This is a fabulous hotel! We just returned from a 3 week honeymoon and this was one of the best hotels of our trip. We stayed here for 5 nights and were very happy with the whole experience and also felt like we got great value for our money.The room was very modern and comfortable and we slept very well each night. We were on the inner courtyard, which was very quiet and had a nice breeze coming in the window. There was an automated shade you activate by a button on the bedside table which completely covers the windows and makes the room very dark for a nap. The bathroom was very modern and nice. The free drinks (water, soda, beer) in the mini bar were a nice treat. As a bonus for booking online, we got free breakfast. The buffet was excellent and included lots of pastries and bread, meat and cheese, fruit, cereal and juices. You could also order hot items but we never got around to it because the buffet included these excellent little sandwiches of ham, salami or cheese that fueled us through all our tourist activities.The people there were also fantastic. The front desk staff was very professional and helpful. The AskMe service was extremely beneficial since neither of us spoke Spanish or Catalan. They were able to answer questions and help us with restaurants, attractions, trains, everything. They recommended an amazing Tapas bar called Tapas 24 that was one of the highlight meals of our trip.Hotel was also very accessible by taxi and there is a metro station just outside.We will definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends.

<Content>Best Hotel in Barcelona This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. It is small, in immaculate condition, in a perfect location for sightseeing or being downtown. The staff, in particular the concierge staff, both alvaro and alfredo were attentive, caring, took all the time in the world with you, and knew the city well. You never felt they were rushed. If they said they would do something [eg make a dinner resrevation, print out a train schedule, etc. it was done]. The breakfast [free if you book online with them] is phenomenal, order what you want or get the buffet, or both. Very trendy design. Just the nicest people. We had a room on the 2nd floor facing right on the main street, and it was absolutely quiet in the room. You just can't do better in a boutique hotel! Because it was booked for part of our stay, we had to move tot he Claris. That was very nice, but the staff just didnt have the personal interest in you that was evident in the paseo de gracia.

<Content>Excellent stay Just returned from easter trip to Barcelona where we stayed at Hotel Prestige. We stayed at superior room at the top floor which had greatviews and there was no noise from the street. Location was excellent,short distance from shops and sights and area is very beatiful and safe. I recommend having breakfast at hotel, it was one of the best we have had. Room was spacious and bed was excellent. I also recommend using AskMe service provided by hotel.

<Content>Loved the Prestige We stayed here for a week after Christmas 2006, and enjoyed our stay. Our room had a cool outdoor terrace with plenty of outdoor furniture for us to have friends over for drinks. The mini-fridge had complimentary drinks and snacks that were refilled everyday. The room is very contemporary with clean furnishings and linens. The bathroom is modern and had nice amenities. The room had a nice remote electronic lighting control and shade control. This is something more hotels in America need to catch onto. We had complimentary breakfast buffet everyday which was served by pleasant waitresses. The food choices and quality were great. The conceirge wasn't as helpful as one would expect, but nice to have one anyway. Overall, the hotel is nicer than the website would suggest. For the price you pay, you get a smaller, more private hotel, excellent personal front desk service, free breakfast buffet, free in-room drinks and snacks, nice trendy furniture and room layout.

<Content>great location, design hotel A lovely modern hotel in a great location, on a wide, very smart shopping boulevard in the centre. Also about 30 seconds from the (underground) train station to the airport (25 mins).Apart from the usual complaints about working the lights/blinds, and flooding the bathroom with the shower, we really enjoyed the room and our stay. Booked through the hotel website which gave us a free breakfast. We were at the back, and didn't hear any noise apart from a little from the corridor.

<Content>Close but no cigar A great location and a text-book good hotel. Not particularly interesting or distinctive in any way and not quite as special as billed. We had a executive room and got a bit of extra space but it had the smallest bathroom in the world, in need of some work and really not somewhere to whallow. No english tv/ movie channel also caused some annoyance, particularly on a wet afternoon.Breakfast was very good , however, and free as we'd booked directly with the hotel. Definitely worth doing if you're going to stay here!

<Content>Bit over designed but good ok, the lighting buttons/system are tricky, and the shower does flood the floor etc and the bathroom is generally 'form over function', the safe was inaccessible and the corners of the bed were sharp/easy to catch. But the bed was huge, low and comfortable, the sheets were lovely, the lighting masterful (once you got the hang of it) and the free soft drinks (generously replenished daily) appreciated. A lot of the things we value in a hotel were in evidence. We worried on arrival that our room was near the service lift (we like a quiet room) but it wasn't a problem - the housekeeping staff and other guests returning to their rooms seemed very respectful of others (maybe we were just lucky) and it seemed well soundproofed though of course you could hear a little plumbing noise. I deliberately booked a room at back (overlooking the Japanese garden - which was a bit disappointing - asnd only the basement level rooms out back have a terrace) for quietness, but suspect front ones ok if you're not too noise sensitive.Overall we enjoyed the hotel's good quality, highly contemporary decor, the fact the wooden corridors were strip carpetted, the door closers were quiet + smooth, and the glass lift the swiftest and smoothest we've encountered - all in all a stylish refurbishment of an old building. Small hotel so not too many guests.The staff were exemplary, paticularly Alvaro, the ask me person on duty our first day - who gave us a highly intelligent suggestions on how to plan our day given our length of stay, how well we knew the city and the age/type of people we are - this really helped us make best use of time in a city where there's so much to do and see. The dining room food was very good (though we didn't eat dinner there - if you like this hotel , you'll love CinqSentits restaurant - about 15 mins walk - a Nicolas Lander FT food critic recommendation which proved excellent). Reception staff were courteous and caring, and room service cheery and upbeat (though the room service food seemed a bit disappointing compared to breakfast). Laid back clientelle - mix of business/conference and up-market private guests. Let's face it, this is the price you have to pay these days to get a nice experience without the riffraff (340 E a night, with an excellent breakfast thrown in if you book over the Internet - trust this, it does work!). And best of all, it's right in the middle of all the best shops, and within easy walking distance of all the others. There are probably quite a few other hotels in Barcelona which compare with this one - it's such a stylish city. Would we stay again - yes.

<Content>Great Experience, Great Location We just returned from a 3-night stay at the Prestige. It is in a great location on Paseo de Gracia, just a few blocks up from the Placa Catalunya and 1-2 blocks from two of Gaudi's apartment masterpieces.The Good: Wonderful location. It felt very safe, especially as we were concerned about personal safety (i.e. pickpocket warnings) in the old city and around Las Ramblas. We had a car and we parked for FREE in the underground parking structure right in front of the hotel (the hotel gave us a card to exit when we left). The rooms were good size and nicely appointed. Wonderful shower. Most impressive of all was the service. We had lost our luggage at the beginning of our trip (7 days prior to our stay at Prestige!) and after we notified them that the suitcases may arrive before we did, they asked us about them, then when they did arrive on our second day at the Prestige, they actually called me on my cell phone that afternoon to notify us that our luggage had just arrived 2 minutes ago. We also utilized their free and very helpful concierge service.The Bad: (1) We booked their least expensive room (168 euros/night) and it was an internal room, which meant the only window looked onto a wall and if you cranked your neck up, you could sort of see the sky through an atrium skylight. We could have moved to an exterior room for an additional 35 euros/night but decided against it since we weren't planning to spend much time in the room. But, it was pitch black in the morning until we hit the button to open the shade - which couldn't be controlled independently of the lights! I could not tell the window situation when I booked on their website. (2) The system of master light switches in the room were ridiculous to operate and we never could get the lights on and the shade positioned as we wanted them. My advice to the hotel, forget the fancy master switch and just install switches that your customers can actually operate! (3) Breakfast was expensive, so we skipped it for simple cafe breakfasts nearby.Overall, however, we had a wonderful stay at the Prestige and in Barcelona. We walked to Sagrada Familia (a definite must-see) then took a taxi to the Picasso Museum and walked all over the old quarter. Dinner at Cinc Sentitis (found in Frommer's) was absolutely wonderful!

<Content>Form defeats function We have gone to Barcelona during one of the biggest conferences in the city, so we were pleased to be able to get a room. But for the amount the hotel is charging one would expect everything to work and for the service to be well-nigh perfect. The so-called advanced audio system never worked, nor was fixed while we were there; the lighting system was an ordeal to figure out and the shower a near disaster. To design a shower head that can only be adjusted by the water-pressure, invites regular flooding of the bathroom at every shower. What difference does it makes to have lovely bath-salts, candles and etc. if they are dissolve in water all the time? Then the 'best' that happened with us at any hotel room so far - one night my wife just closed the bathroom door, when the WHOLE FALSE CEILING IN THE ENTRY HALL FALLEN OFF! Sounded like a rocket boom, but no one seemed to care. I called the desk - the chap, who was there all by himself lumbered himself up, looked at it, said not the best design, I think, then said that he cannot fix it, we'll have maintenance fix it in the morning which they did. All through this and even upon leaving the hotel, not one soul could be bothered to say even as much as a simple 'sorry'. Also, be very careful of the free internet service: when we were there the machine had a trojan; a couple of sites I was working with was attacked after I logged off. A couple of pluses though: the cleanliness is exemplary, the breakfast food and service staff are excellent and the AskMe people are great, knowledgeable and helpful. But overall, for the price, you will find better value elsewhere.

<Content>Fabulous hotel Great hotel ,slick ,cool rooms ,we stayed in an executive ,one of the most comfortable beds and pillows i have experienced in a hotel.The crowning glory is the fabulous concierge service.We were extremely demanding and asked for very specific suggestions on everything to from things to do, to see ,where to eat ,where to to shop. Even out of the ordinary requests where to buy spansih ham and cheese, to a place to watch the football world cup ,non touristy inexpensive local restaurant reservations ,and every bit of advice was absolutely FANTASTIC.STAY HERE!!!

<Content>Fantastic We loved this hotel and Barcelona. The hotel was fantastic, slick and modern with really friendly and helpful staff and our room was gorgeous. The free mini-bar is a nice touch - there's nothing expensive in there and I'm sure it costs them next to nothing to keep it stocked, but it's great to come back from a day tramping around Barcelona to a free mini-bar. The products in the bathroom were good quality, and we loved the dimmer switch and candles in the bathroom - very romantic!I would definitely go here again.

<Content>Great location good points hotel was gorgeous, really trendy and minimalist and in a fantastic location. we also got upgraded to a superior room with nice japanese garden and decking. the ask me service is great (although he always seems to be VERY busy so make sure you have enough time to wait and speak to him properly!). staff very friendly. free mini bar which even contained a few beers along with soft drinks. becuase we were staying a sunday night, the hotel paid our return taxi to the airport.bad points - rooms are that well sound proofed so it was quite noisy as we had screaming children with jet lag in the next room to us who were awake late into the night! other bad point was that there was a leak in our bathroom from upstairs which couldn't be fixed. they offered to move us however it would've been back to an executive room and seeing as we loved our superior room, we decided to put up with it! all in all, i'm not sure the hotel was worth the money..... the majestic was 拢100 cheaper than this and right next to the hotel so maybe we'd try that..... but no huge complaints to be honest!

<Content>a great place to stay this is a great place... our room was spacious and funky with some nice touches like candles, nice toiletries etc. dont forget your CD's! the atmosphere is very relaxed the library a nice place to just sit with a drink or have breakfast. food is lovely at breakfast. the best thing though, is the ASK ME service... whatever you want they can help you and you feel no question is too stupid to ask ....it means you end up eating and drinking (or shopping, or whatever!) in places to suit you rather than some horrible tourist place with pictures of food in the window! finally everything is pretty much walking distance... thoroughly recommended

<Content>disappointing We chose this hotel because of its location, and the location turned out to be about the only positive thing about the Prestige. We had to change rooms the day after our arrival as the TV set was out of order and one of the sliding doors stuck denying us access to the bathroom. The room we moved to was smaller, the bedside lights regulation didn't work, terras doors were stuck, there were also other small irritating things. Everytime we faced a problem it took at least three calls to the front desk (and half a day) to have someone come over, only to say it could not be fixed.The Ask Me service was good and a free minibar a pleasant surprise.Overall, the hotel is in a very bad shape and definitely overpriced. Modern design in itself does not guarantee a nice stay.

<Content>Nice hotel, great location Just returned from a 2 nights stay. In Barcelona for 5 nights with 3 nights at another 4 star hotel. I prefer to stay in newer 4-5 star hotels. Location is ideal on the nicest street in the city with easy access to metro and bus touristic. No restaurant but you will not miss that as there are a multitude very close. Had a room in the back...very quiet. Rooms are nicely appointed and spacious but bathroom is quite small. Bathroom amenities are very good quality. At your service concierge is extremely helpful. Breakfast is good but not included. The other hotel I stayed at the breakfast was included and still about 40 euros less but you're paying for the location. Access to Holmes gym is complimentary and about 3 blocks away. Great gym facility! Overall, a nice boutique hotel but a bit expensive.

<Content>Modernist style with substance This is an excellent base in Barcelona for those who like style minimalist luxury but not at the expense of professional but friendly service. The hotel has a library and their Ask Me service was a really great bonus - dedicated staff on hand who know the city well  can reserve tickets / make restaurant reservations for you. We'd not stayed in Barcelona before and found it invaluable as nothing was too much trouble. Great location - central for classy shopping / nice cafes and restaurants as well as the very convenient for one of the open top bus tour stops about 150 metres away. This is a fantastic way to orientate to the city as we'd never stayed before. Rooms are quite spacious, with free soft drinks and chocolate in the minibar. Bathrooms have opaque glass sliging doors and are large. There were good generous bathrobes and powerful shower. It was really good to have wifi internet access as the Hilton hotel I've stayed in makes you pay. A tremendous find !

<Content>Yes, i'd recommend it to my friends! We went to the Prestige after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor: it's been the right choice! The location is actually convenient, for shopping eand it's a few steps away two Gaudi's houses. The entrance is minimalist and impressive, the living room on the first floor is useful (they help you with reservations at restaurants and if you need to take a look at books on the city) and it is a quiet place to stay for a rest after a long day sightseeing. We asked for a room off the road to avoid the traffic noise (Paseo de Gracia is a very busy road, there's a taxi stop in front of the hotel) but the rooms on the last floor are more spacious and full of natural light. We enjoyed the bed: large and soft and there's also a nice shower. Everything was fine but, honestly, going back to Barcelona i would try one of the Hotels in the Barrio Gotico, so full of spanish taste! The Prestige is still a very good place to stay, i would recommend it to my friends.

<Content>Ultra chic hotel Prestige Paseo de Gracia is a first class boutique hotel. It is located on Paseo de Gracia(center of Barcelona)not very far from Gaudi鈥檚 La Pedrera. The rooms are modernly decorated in wooden hues. Hats off to the interior designer. The bathrooms are of a very high standard with all the modern amenities and some nice oriental touches. Everything is electronically activated including the curtains. TV can be watched through Bang and Olufsen sets. The hotel itself is small and has no restaurant and therefore no room service. However the lounge area is very comfortable where you can read the large selection of books while being served champagne and strawberries. There is also the Ask Me desk which is their concierge service. They can practically find anything you are looking for although we had them stumped on where to for a good vegan meal. I stayed here with my wife and spent 3 romantic nights in absolute luxury. The only caveat is that the rooms at the front of the hotel, though possessing small balconies, can be somewhat noisy due to having an overview of the busy Paseo de Gracie. The back of the hotel is quieter though at the expense of any type of interesting view.

<Content>5 Star in all Aspects I have stayed in many acclaimed hotels in Barcelona (Hotel Ritz) and throughout Europe, USA and Asia and have never received such great service. Barcelona was my first stop on a 3 city European business trip. My luggage was lost, causing a catastrophe, as I was leaving the next day for Paris. The concierge or Ask Me person took all my information and worked on locating my belongings while I was out for the day. Upon returning to the hotel, both he and the hotel General Manager were on phones tracking the luggage. The both went above and beyond the call of duty. The rooms are completely renovated and have modern decor and electronics, which is not always common in Europe, especially ones I have stayed in Barcelona. The location is ideal for shopping, restaurants and site seeing. It was the best trip to Barcelona by far due to where I stayed. I will not stay anywhere else in future trips.

<Content>Unimpressed in Barcelona I guess I should have heeded the review that stated 鈥渢his is not a luxury hotel.鈥?I will be the first to tell you in fact that it is nothing of the sort. It is a very nice hotel in a great location, but don鈥檛 expect all those extra touches that make a luxury hotel so special. I love small, trendy hotels mostly because I love attention to detail and oddly that is exactly what the Prestige neglected, the small details. Many of the things I have to complain about are very small issues that alone would be silly to complain about, however as a whole turned our experience into a bit of a disappointment. Firstly we were given a room on the main street although I had specifically requested a room off the street. Our room was quite small (not too surprising for a Metropolitan hotel room) and had no table and only 1 chair (which I thought was hideous and disturbed the otherwise well decorated feel of the room). One of the much advertised points of the hotel is 鈥渉is鈥? 鈥渉ers鈥?toiletry kits, my kit had nothing more than a comb and broken nail file. Additionally the hotel does not offer conditioner. When I asked the front desk to send up some conditioner I was greeted with utter incredulity, the man at the desk told me, 鈥淗otels in Spain do not have conditioner.鈥?When I politely stated that the last hotel I stayed in had conditioner he actually asked me if I was sure the hotel was in Spain (all in the entire incident was rather amusing, but frustrating none the less). They also tout their 鈥渇ree minibar,鈥?which consisted of a Kit Kat a couple of sodas and 2 small bottles of water. Another supposed great feature is the fully automated lighting system, although very cool in theory, the reality was a pain. Other small oversights: no washcloths, hooks for robes were located over the toilet and not accessible to the shower, no in room movies (not that we would鈥檝e watched them, but鈥?, our room was skipped-over for turn-down service twice despite us being out for the evening, there were several tears in the carpet and holes in the artwork on the walls, etc... On a positive note the 鈥淎sk Me鈥?staff was absolutely fantastic and did their up-most to accommodate even our most bizarre requests. The rooms were very quite (despite being on the main road) and dark, with ultra comfortable beds; ideal for those who want to enjoy the Barcelona nightlife and sleep til afternoon. I would not stay in this hotel again especially since there are many other great small hotels around Barcelona, which are less expensive, but if money isn鈥檛 an issue and you don鈥檛 care about the 鈥渓ittle things,鈥?then the location is great and you should be insured a good night鈥檚 rest (unless the room above you floods, but that is a whole 鈥榥other story).
