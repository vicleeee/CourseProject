<Content>I was lied to about water view! When booking this hotel for a very special New Year's Eve stay, I specifically asked for a guaranteed water view, and paid the premium price for one. Upon check in, they acknowledged a water view, but when I went to the room and opened up the curtains, all I could see was this huge container ship right in front of my window! I could not see a drop of water, much less any view of the Sound or the mountains. Surely a mistake had been made, but when I went back down to the front desk, the staff insisted that this was a water view room, and it wasn't their fault if there was a huge cargo ship there completely blocking the view. They wouldn't let me cancel without forfeiting the entire night's fee, and said they had no other rooms available. There was only one towel in the bathroom, and the room was very small and crowded with the bed and one chair. It sounded like a party was going on overhead, and the noise continued until about 4 am. I have never been more dissatisfied with a hotel. I found the staff to be curt.

<Content>This is a great hotel I have stayed at this hotel twice now while visiting Seattle on business. It is in a great location right on the waterfront. Walking distance to Pike's Market and many other downtown locations. You can take an elevator just outside the hotel to go up to the next street level (Seattle is hilly).Hotel staff is great. The rooms are nice. Many rooms have water views. The hotel restaurant (Fish Club by Todd English) is very good.I will continue to stay here when I am in Seattle.

<Content>Location makes this place We stayed here on a rainy Seattle weekend. Very nice waterfromt location. This hotel is great for first time visitors to Seattle.You are only 3 blocks away from the Pike Place Market. That is where I advice going for breakfast or lunch. It is very easy to visit the Market in the early opening hours, before it gets so busy. This hotel is within walking distance of ferry terminals , downtown, and the sculpture park. Very nice location. The staff, especially at the front door were friendly and welcoming. Nice lobby. The beds and linens were great . A nice quiet place. My only complaint - 32 dollar a day parking.

<Content>Great hotel and location Stayed at this property for a combo business/pleasure trip. Service and amenities were excellent. Attentive, helpful staff, great food even in the business meetings, which is often just so-so. Only negative - hard to see from Alaskan Way so drive carefully.

<Content>Good but not great - close to everything It has a very different look from a standard Marriot. Location is great for access to the waterfront. There is a railroad that travels on the back side of hte hotel and a main road along the front, so a little challenging getting across the road to the piers and restaurants. Also, the pier for the cruise ships is directly across Alaskan Way in front of the hotel, so when the ships unload, it gets pretty busy. Other than the above, typical Marriot quality and service.

<Content>awesome for cruisers We needed a place near the Bell street Pier for our cruise to Alaska. The Marriott Waterfront was wonderful for location and service! Cannot thank the people there enough for the wonderful hospitality and kindness. Traveling with someone in a wheelchair has special challenges, and I think this hotel filled our needs perfectly including delivering a shower chair immediately to our room. Classy and comfortable rooms with beautiful views of the water, and my personal favorite thing in a hotel a great bed and quiet sleeping environment!  The bellmen were super!! Each went beyond the call of duty including helping us get to the dock before the cruise and helping us after we arrived back in Seattle after the Cruise. Thank you Men for getting us to the Airport ontime...helping us find a taxi that would meet our needs as well as keeping luggage for us in a safe place until it was time to go.  The restaurant, The Fish Club, had a most delicous breakfast omelet I have ever had...far surpassed anything I ever found on the cruise ship.  The lobby was beautiful and so comfortable...actually took photos of the glass sculpture prominently featured. A library-like nook with comfortable chairs and books to read. I could move in! Never felt so welcome at a hotel in my life and I have stayed at 5 star places in major cities. I will go back definately. Short walk to the Acquarium, steps from an elevator taking you closer up the hill to the Pike's Place Market (maybe 3 blocks away?), and felt safe, but near so many of Seattle's attractions. Many thanks to all the Seattle Mariott Waterfront employees that helped us! you are the best!!

<Content>nice location, 24 hr room service a plus front desk staff kind and courteous. very comfortable beds. 24 hr room service with a limited menu, but this was great. interesting pool which is 1/2 indoors and 1/2 outdoors. deck on the outside of the pool area was very comfortable and a nice place to relax. liked that 1/2 of the pool was outdoors. indoor pool hotels tend to have a real chlorinated smell that hits you when you open the door. with this pool because 1/2 of it is outside, you can actually swim in an area and not breathe all that chlorine which is definitely refreshing! hotel is in a great location, 5 mins walk from aquarium, miner's landing (small arcade and eating place next to aquarium), seafood restaurant across street, pike's market easily accessible through shortcut up elevator. cruise ship terminal across street. a very tough walk up a hill to get the space needle, even though we did walk from the hotel it was somewhat of a distance. flat screen tvs in the rooms, very long granite counters in the bathroom and very large closets. coffee place in the hotel that serves starbucks and yes, another starbucks right across the valet parking area, but this is seattle so who's counting coffee houses? good concierge with great recommendations. very good restaurant in lobby. would not hesitate to recommend hotel.

<Content>Beautiful VIew and great overall experience I Stayed at the Seattle Marriot Waterfront from July 9-18 for work. The hotel is right on the bay and the views are pretty amazing. You are walking distance to everything. Only a mile or so to the M's and Seahawks stadiums, the SPace Needle etc. The food in the city was imo not great. I didn't eat at the Hotel restaurant, The Fish Club by Todd English, while there but did have room service. Room service was average or slightly above, nothing to write home about. The room was great, very clean, roomy, nice bathroom. The hotel is very nice. Ultra Modern, a nice lobby bar overall a pretty hip spot.

<Content>This is a fabulous hotel Just went to Seattle for the first time and got hotel recommendations from a friend of a friend who lives there. This hotel is right on the Puget Sound and is spotlessly clean, with an amazing staff. We travel frequently and I have to say these folks surpassed all expectations! We paid a bit extra for a waterfront view and was definitely worth it. A short walk uphill and we were in the middle of the Pike Street Market with lots of great shops and restaurants. A few short blocks away was Pioneer Square with much more shopping, clubs and restaurants. Right in front of our hotel was the waterfront, with yachts and touristy restaurants intermingled. Parking was a bit pricey at $32 a night and this hotel is not inexpensive - but the comfort, amenities, location, ambience and service made it our favorite of our Pacific Northwest trip.

<Content>Loved everything Marriott We just stayed 3 nights at the Waterfront Marriott. Everything was great, couldnt find anything to complain about. Thought the price was compareable for Seattle hotels. The view was amazing. We had a corner unit with two balconies. We loved every minute of the stay. Loved watching the cruise ships come and go. The room was really nice and was surprised it was so big.

<Content>Great hotel - great location I thought would add some comments here since the reviews here go both ways. Location: This hotel is in a good location - right on the water front as the name implies, and a quick 5-10 minute walk to Pikes market. You do have to take an elevator or stairs and then walk up a block or 2, but no big deal. I think being below Pikes Market, and on the water-front gives you quick, convenient access to 2 of the great features Seattle has to offer. (Tip: Check out the park at the end of the street -- to the north of the hotel - it is a very nice park!) Hotel: Nicely decorated. Concierge floor has very nice views. The salmon offered in the morning was a very nice touch. Parking is steep but all parking in the area is high priced and the valets have to make some money. The only negative I have is that the rooms were a little smaller than a normal Marriott - not that big of a deal if you don't spend much time in the room. Other than that, highly recommend.

<Content>Nothing special for the $$$ We just returned home from our Seattle vacation and our last night was spent at the Marriott, based largely in part because of other members' recommendations. While the hotel itself was okay, we expected more, especially since we'd just stayed in another really lovely hotel in Seattle earlier in the week for less money. I tend to be pretty particular about hotels, but can forgive certain things if the place is clean. We noticed that the towels had a funky odor to them, which was kind of nasty, and that the bathroom wasn't as clean as I would have hoped for. Also, when we made the reservations, we were informed that our breakfast would be included in the price of the room, which was a nice bonus. However, upon checking in and being told that we'd been given a room on the concierge level, we learned that whatever amenities came with the concierge level didn't extend into past Thursday...and we happened to be staying over on a Friday. Kind of a bummer. Also, the hotel info book in our room listed the hours that breakfast is served, and from that, we learned that our free continental breakfast wasn't offered on the weekend. My husband happened to wander down to the concierge lounge this morning, just to see what was happening, and lo and behold - we'd just missed the breakfast that wasn't supposed to be happening. Oh, well. On the plus side, we were very close to Pike Market - just a short walk from the elevator and then another couple of blocks to the market itself. The bellhops were attentive and offered us water every time we left the building and we were able to secure a taxi back to the airport in a matter of seconds. It was a decent hotel, but for nearly $400 for one night, I would have expected much more.

<Content>All the details are excellent! We loved this hotel. The location was ideal - walking to Pike Place Mkt, Aquarium, downtown. The lobby is beautiful, water-themed. The beds extremely comfortable. Showers are strong. Bellmen are super attentive. I commented to my daughter going into the hotel that we needed to get some water and a bellman came over and handed us two bottles of water. The concierges are extremely helpful. One emailed us before the trip and called with information. On site, another helped us plan kayaking on Lake Union. The designers of this hotel planned well -- little touches like quaint rugs in the elevators, candles on the front desk at night, generally lovely atmosphere.

<Content>good experience Stayed here for two nights with our 4 and 6 year old kids. They had no problem going up the hill to Pike Place Market. There were some great restaurants nearby, and it was very convenient to the cruise ship terminal. We carried our luggage across the street. Really no big problems at all - kids loved the pool, lobby was nice, breakfast was expensive for a buffet, so we walked to Pike Place. Concierge was friendly and helpful.

<Content>Yea and YES I stay here often, as in every month or so. I am either with children and a nanny in a suite which is ultimately luxe or I stay in a single room because I am adjacent to night life but without the noise. BAR staff is top of the line. Brown haired barmaid is always at your service and food is great no matter what the hour. Keep in mind I love this place with 2 boys under the age of 6, or with my husband, or sans any accompaniment at all.

<Content>Marriott Waterfront.....Yes  After researching and reading reviews for this property, for the most part, I felt accounts were accurate. On the other hand, for those seeking a realistic account of this property, please read on.1. Good location if: You are departing/arriving for an Alaskan cruise, interested in exploring Belltown, love being in a wharf type atmosphere. 2. Previous accounts and hotel website act as if Pike Place Market is merely an elevator lift away.....not exactly. You have a bit of a walk (uphill) so keep it mind if you have a elderly guest or child in your party. (We did not, but as a mother of two small ones, I could imagine the hike would have been an issue.)3. We were guests of an upgraded room with a balcony (#674) We did indeed have a more spacious balcony than others, but with that perk came a consistant group of drunken, foul mouthed local (perhaps homeless) individuals peering directly into our room from the elevator leading to Pike Place. So, with the audience, we didn't spend much time on the balcony.4. On a good note: Friendly staff as you would always expect at our beloved Marriott.5. My local favorites: Metropolitan Grill if you are looking for a special night. Just know going in $$$$$Belltown Pizza has a jerk of a bartender (possibly owner) but sweet waitress  amazing pizza (very close to Marriott)88 Keys is a dueling piano bar in Pioneer Square (easy walk if your tipsy) and tons of fun.Salish Lodge is great for a massage!!!!!Red Hook  Chatuea St Michelle in Woodenville make for an easy daytrip....beautiful drive.Have fun in this wonderful city :)

<Content>Great hotel, Great location My family and I stayed at this Marriot for two days before a Holland America cruise (which was beyond fantastic by the way!). The hotel was well-appointed, clean, helpful, had great amenities and had a perfect location. It is a five minute walk from the Pike Place market, a short walk from the aquarium, and a few minutes from many great restaurants. As to the room, the beds were wonderfully comfortable and the bathrooms were perfectly adequate. On a side note, I would suggest a stay here especially if you are heading out on a cruise. the piers are right outside the hotel for Celebrity and Norwegian cruise lines and a five minute cab ride for Holland America and Royal Caribbean.

<Content>A Wonderful Stay We stayed for a night before our cruise to Alaska. Beautiful hotel, great location for access to our cruise ship and for seeing Seattle waterfront area. Just steps away from Pike Place Market and all the sights along the waterfront. Walk or take the free trollys to lots of area sights including the Space Needle. We made reservations months in advance so the price was reasonable (under $300.00 per night for Concierge level which included breakfast, snacks and evening wine and cheese). Wonderful friendly and accomodating service, really yummy apples at the front desk, we enjoyed all the perks of this beautiful hotel. Our room could have had a nicer view but we were gone except to sleep. The train runs along the back of the hotel but the noise was faint. There wasn't enough wrong to keep us from staying again in the future.

<Content>Nothing really to complain about Stayed in this hotel whilst on a business trip. The location was ideal - plenty of restaurants nearby, the market and downtown Seattle is no more than a few minutes (and fortunately one lift) away. The hotel restaurant, although on the high side of the price window is excellent - had by far my best Clam Chowder there. The hotel itself is not the cheapest but you get what you pay for, staff were excellent, rooms spotless and very comfortable, the bar and restaurant equally relaxing and room service without fault. I shall be returning soon and will have no issue with using this hotel again.

<Content>Absolutely wonderful experience My husband and I recently celebrated our 10th anniversary with a 4 day stay in Seattle at the Waterfront Marriott. I cannot say enough good things about our time there. With the help of the wonderful concierge Margo, my husband was able to surprise me by having local cheese and wine waiting in our room on arrival; on her own, Margo had added some chocolate and a lovely bouquet. Margo also arranged reservations for two fantastic dinners (Palisade and the Waterfront Seafood Grill) during our time there. The staff--from the front desk to housekeeping to valets--were all extremely courteous and attentive. Our view, which looked out on Elliott Bay, was magnificent, and the room was very clean, quiet, and comfortable. I enjoyed the modern decor of the hotel. Very convenient location, just down from Pike's Place and right across from a free shuttle that goes to Pioneer Square. We had a perfectly wonderful stay and look forward to returning sometime.

<Content>Marriott Waterfront Seattle, a good Choice Stay one night on points, before flying out of SEATAC on a mid day flight. Very nice hotel which is close to the Pike's Place area and shopping. Norstrom rack is just 2 or so streets above the hotel. The rooms are very nice and the beds are very comfortable. They have a Starbucks right off the lobby and another one acrross the enterance way to the hotel. Park in the World Trrade Center above and to the left of the hotel, it is much cheaper than the valet parking. Nice location and good eats across the street at the Bell Street Dinner, you get Anthony's Homeport food at a much cheaper price.Also great views of Elliott Bay.

<Content>Great Location and views Stayed 3/28-30. Was in town for Springsteen at Key Arena. Room was not ready for early check-in nor was it ready at 4pm when it should have been. So that was a negative. As was parking fee of $32/night. But in terms of location and views this was great. Had a bay view corner room. Plenty of windows to take advantage of the view. Walked to Pikes Market (one block south on Alaskan Way, turn left, up elevator, one block east, one more block south on Western, and there you are. Walked to Anthony's Pier 66 for dinner and Elliot's for lunch. Quick drive to Key Arena and about 20 minute drive to Ray's Boathouse for dinner. Pretty quick access to I-5 to Woodinville for wine tastings. Property is clean and well kept. Stopped in excecise room - looks decent - indoor and outdoor pool combo too. Nice enough lobby bar with pianist one night we stopped. Because it is down by the water you avoid the typical city street driving hassles for the most part. Looking to return for Yankees games.

<Content>An Ideal Location with an Ideal Staff This hotel is all and more than what I had hoped. When we arrived I felt that the room we initially booked was a bit too small and we were immediately given a suite with an extraordinary 180 degree view of Elliot Bay and Puget Sound. The staff was extremely helpful although ironically the concierge seemed a bit immature for her profession. I must add that the restaurant, The Fish Club, was wonderful. Cuisine that I would expect at more exclusive eateries. I would also recommend this hotel for those wishing to be close to the Pike's Market as it is just an elevator ride away. Altogether a wonderful visit. It is clean and quiet as well despite, the weekend we were there, loaded with children.

<Content>newish and clean I stayed here just one night for a meeting. The lobby was obviously decorated in a new style and I was told the property is 4 years old. I asked for a room with a view on check in, and they did their best to accomodate me as it was only 11am. My room had a balcony-smallest I ever saw-about 5'x5'- I would more properly call it a viewing platform. My direct view was of the other wing of the hotel,but off to the side I could see the bay. The room had a digital thermostat which I always appreciate. Typical new Marriott comfortable bed with down bedding, nice Bath and Body Works toiletries. My only complaint was the room was poorly lit and desperately needed a desk lamp. If I had been staying longer, I would have asked if I could get another lamp. Internet worked well and although it was $10/day, I have paid more at other properties. The hotel is immediately adjacent to rail road tracks and I had been warned by locals that the trains may keep me up all night. I actually found the room to be very quiet. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Had a great dinner directly across the street at Anthonys.

<Content>Not sure about this one, more on my part than the Marriott's Not sure about this one because I suppose much depends on what you expect from Seattle. We had a very limited time there, less than 24 hours.Reception staff were thin on the ground. It took 15 mins to get to the front of check in (and we are elite members).I had expected more of the waterfront area. Of course it was winter and rather grey and gloomy as one would expect for Seattle at this time of year, but the waterfront (in case you don't know) is very industrial with big freight ships and a railway track nearby. To be fair I had not done my research, as we were staying such a short time to catch a flight back to London, but I don't think I would be in a rush to return.The hotel has adequate room service and the staff do seem willing to please. There is quite a nice (small) pool area which goes outside, so is part in and part out, which the kids liked.The bar menu is very limited, but they are willing to serve options from the fish restaurant attached to the hotel in the bar. At 3p.m. it was not possible to obtain bar or restaurant service, and we were referred to room service (but we had already checked out, and to be honest wanted a meal in a bar/restaurant,) but as a special request, the fish restaurant would serve us a late lunch (they did not open for dinner until 4p.m.), this was a rather nice touch and the staff were friendly and helpful.Our fellow travellers had difficulties with a less than perfectly clean room, but ours was fine, very clean and the Marriott bed was as usual lovely.At the time we stayed in early January, the area felt a little deserted, but may have more atmosphere at other times of the year. It reminded us of a rather jaded English seaside resort, but with more of a big city edge. Limited experience with the locals, and the mounted police (the kids wanted to stroke the horse) was very positive. There is a handy lift from the waterfront area up to Pike Place (the market) if you turn left out of the hotel past the fish restaurant you should find it on the left. Not sure how I would feel about walking around in this area late at night though, if necessary I would perhaps check with a local. It may feel better at a busier time of year.In all the Marriott did feel homely when we were in a completely new place for such a short time.

<Content>Best HOTEL...Make it a trip to remember! My husband and I could not stop talking about how great we felt when staying at this Marriott. The rooms are clean and modern, the views were great, and the service was unbelievable. Every person we passed would acknowledge us as guests and do whatever they could to make our stay better. The little touches make a difference like how quickly they bring your car around and how they give you water to take with you at the valet. The concierge made us a reservation at a local restaurant and she ordered up a special appetizer for us at dinner...on her! What a great surprise. I can't say enough about the manager of this hotel because he or she must set an awesome leadership example to have EVERYONE so focused on service from the front desk clerks, the maids who clean the rooms, and the valet guys. We can't wait to go back!! I have never felt sad to leave a hotel until staying at this Marriott. Perfect loaction near the market, downtown shops, and beautiful walking trails near the water. Don't miss staying at this great hotel!!!

<Content>Classy, comfortable place We stayed here using a voucher but certainly weren't treated as coupon customers. Nice, helpful staff, clean, comfortable rooms. Don't miss the indoor/outdoor pool, which was great even in October. Our voucher included breakfast buffets at the Todd English restaurant downstairs, which filled us up well into the afternoon.

<Content>AS BAD AS IT GETS.... My one night at this hotel- which cost almost $1000.00- was as bad an experience as I have ever encountered at a Marriott Hotel. While very pleasant, management was totally ineffective at resolving any of the issues brought to their attention. The General Manager particularly seemed ill at ease in the hotel and avoided guests and their feedback.Despite three calls to the hotel's Room Dvisions Manager prior to our arrival, our assigned room was not in any way what had been both promised and guaranteed.Food in the Tood English restaurant was barely edible. Service was spot on, but one wishes the food would have been up to this Chef's capabilities.Every department- from Room Service to Housekeeping- managed to repeatedly provide service of the lowest standard.An absolute disaster!

<Content>We enjoyed our stay at the Marriott Waterfront This is a nice hotel in a wonderful location. As the name implies, it is situated on the waterfront. The lobby is lovely and spacious. It has a nice bank of elevators which resulted in us never having to wait. Our room had a small balcony with a delightful view overlooking the bay. The room was light and airy. The room had a small refrigerator, which we prefer, rather than the overpriced honor bar one usually finds. There were only three dresser drawers, which was a drawback for us as we were staying for several days. The bathroom had adequate space with nice granite countertops. However, shower caps were not part of the amenities and one had to be requested. Surprising for a hotel in this price range. The beds were quite comfortable. Room service was tasty, but slow. We were advised the wait would be between 30-40 minutes and it was actually about an hour. Newspapers were delivered to our door each morning, even on weekends. The hotel is within walking distance of the Pike Place Market and the wonderful downtown Seattle shopping. However, many of the streets are quite steep, so wear good walking shoes. There is a Starbucks in the hotel as well as directly across the plaza. In addition to the hotel restaurant, there are several restaurants within easy walking distance. There are only two options for parking: Hotel valet parking for a flat daily fee of $32 plus taxes or a parking garage next to the hotel that is not associated with the hotel. For this parking, one has to pay each time one leaves the parking lot; therefore, it would be cost effective only if one left once a day. We used the hotel parking and, while it was not cheap, we never had to wait on our vehicle after calling for it before leaving our room. The hotel staff was always courteous, friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay and would certainly recommend it to others.

<Content>Nice location, but a bit pricey We stayed here the first week of September, 2007. Great location, yes, but a bit pricey. We had a deluxe room, corner suite, with nice views of the Sound. However, at $300+ per night, a bit pricey! Although the room was nice size, certainly not what we would expect for a suite, with no designated sitting area. The room was, in fact, a bit cramped for their largest room size. Also, although the view was good, it looked out over the roof before you had a view of Puget Sound. Great location, convenient to the Market, etc., but a bit too pricey.

<Content>Good location but not worth what you pay We were in Washington and Oregon for a week, and this was the most we paid for a room and the least satisfied we were. To be fair, the location of this hotel is fantastic and the staff was friendly. Unfortunately though, that's where it ends. We were paying close to $300 a night for our room and did not feel like it was worth it at all. Here are my specific complaints:1. Our confirmation said we would have a spectacular view of Elliott Bay. We were able to see the bay, I'll give them that. Spectacular would be overstating it, though. If we stood in one of the corners of the room right up against the window and looked off to the side, we could see the water over top of a couple of parking garages. Spectacular? Not really. This alone would not have been enough to make me complain though since we don't really spend a lot of time in our room.2. The bed was not comfortable AT ALL. I usually like Marriott beds and think they're very comfy. This one was awful. I read another review saying they felt like they were bouncing around all night any time their spouse moved. Yup, I'll agree with that. I don't really have back problems, but by the end of our 3-night stay my back was killing me and I really hadn't slept well because of all the bouncing around. 3. The third morning of my trip, the shower was ice cold. This was the last straw for me. $300 a night for a cold shower? Really??? At this point I filled out a comment card for the manager. I would have called and talked to someone directly but we were in a hurry to get on the road and my husband didn't want me to take the time. I was very specific on the comment card and left all my contact info hoping for something in response, and I have heard absolutely nothing in response to my complaints which makes me cranky. I may still call although I don't know what I would expect to happen at this point. To sum up, the location was really great and for that reason I could give it 2 stars instead of 1. Otherwise I felt like it was a total rip.One more tip: I wouldn't really advise paying a lot of extra money for the concierge level unless you get a good deal and it's not too much more than a regular room. You get free breakfast which is always nice, but it's basically bread stuff (cereal, muffins, etc) and scrambled eggs and bacon. It's the same thing every morning. They have free muchies in the afternoon and you can buy drinks, but the drinks are just as overpriced as they would be in a bar. So it was nice enough and all, but not worth a whole lot of extra money. . \

<Content>Marriott's a lifesaver. We were booked at the Fairmont in Seattle for one night before an Alaskan cruise. We arrived at 1 am. to find that in spite of our calling to confirm arrangements earlier in the day, there were no rooms left, except a double smoking suite. Since there were three of us who were non-smokers with allergies, we could not use that room. Fairmont had their driver take us to the Seattle Marriott Waterfront instead. This inconvenience was a blessing in disguise. The Marriott is situated right near Pike's Market and the Seattle aquarium. The lobby is beautiful. It has a multi-colored carpet and an amazing display of Murano glass (Rumor has it the carpet alone cost $250,000.) One sitting area has a fireplace. Soothing music plays in the background. The manager at the desk welcomed us warmly, accepted our transfer letter from the Fairmont with no question and put us in a non-smoking room with sufficient space for the 3 of us. (Actually, the entire hotel is non-smoking. )The room itself was comfortable, but not exceptional in terms of decor. It looked like a typical business hotel room. The toiletries were a very nice citrus scent from Bath and Body Works. We ordered cereal and milk from room service. It was outrageously priced, but at 2 a.m. we were not in a position to haggle. It did arrive promptly and the people who handled the transaction and delivered the food were very friendly. The next day we were able to tour Pike's Market, have breakfast at Lowell's and see the Seattle Aquarium. Both were only steps away from the Marriott and hotel employees were more than helpful in terms of recommendations and directions. Walking along the waterfront was a pleasant experience, too. To conclude, even though this was not the hotel we intended to stay at, it was a lovely experience and when I return to Seattle, I will stay there again,

<Content>Cheesey and not worth the money We stayed here for two days in August and were not impressed!It is well located on the waterfront right across from were the huge cruise ships come in and there is an elevator that takes you up to Pikes market whcih was celebrating 100 year aniversary so that and the great weather made up for some of what the hotel lacked. We stayed on the club level and there is a cheesey room where there are cheap snacks as in small bags of potao chips and other delicacies. The room was clean but the toilet was like something out of a public restroom and it made a sound like a jet taking off when flushed. There are small balconies that you can barely stand on. But what is really amazing is that there is a train that runs by the hotel several times a day with all of the associated noise that you can expect from a frieght train! Also, when we took the elevator back from the Pikes market at night we thought that we would be killed becasue there are some very unsavofy charecters hanging around!There is better for the money!So unless you enjoy staying on the other side of the tracks for $350 a night, don't bother with this paradise!

<Content>Great experience Stayed at the Marriott Waterfront Seattle over the forth of July holiday. The room we occupied faced the water, and it was your typical Marriott room. The room was clean, as was the bathroom. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Brunch at the restaurant was a bit pricey, but worth every penny. This hotel is in a good location. It was our first time to Seattle and we were able to walk to all the sites we wished to see. Yes, you do have to walk up a hill to reach the market, but there is an outdoor elevator that will take you up about 1/2 way up the hill. The rest of the hill was steep to us, but we live in a flat part of the country so I am sure that the steepness was a relative concept.Like other reviewers, we cashed in our Marriott points to stay in this hotel and were treated exceptionally well by any standards. I would stay here again.

<Content>Not Worth the Money! We stayed in two hotels during our trip to Seattle, the Hotel 1000 at the beginning of the trip and the Marriott Waterfront the night before we left after taking a side trip out of Seattle. Both were the same price per night. The Marriott Waterfront was extremely overpriced. We reserved a room with a King bed and at check-in asked if there were any waterview rooms available. The woman at the front desk was friendly and was able to accommodate our request. Although we had a top floor room, the view of the water was blocked by another large building. My biggest complaint, however, was that the bathroom could have been cleaner, there were several hairs stuck to the ceiling. The bed was not as comfortable as it should have been. Every time my husband rolled over in his sleep, the bed was too bouncy and I would wake up. In general, the hotel needs a bit of updating. On the plus side, the location was very convenient. It is within easy walking distance of the Victoria Clipper pier, many great restaurants and Pike's Place Market. Also, the staff was friendly and helpful.We stayed at a really nice Marriott in Victoria and were disappointed with this one at $300 a night. Not sure why this hotel receives such high reviews, I would choose another hotel.

<Content>One of My Best Marriott Stays Just spent 3 nights at the Marrriott Waterfront Seattle using Marriott Rewards point. Often when using Marriott Points I have been given less than desirable rooms, this was not the case at the Marriott Waterfront Seattle hotel. This was an absolutely perfect stay at a beautiful hotel. The room was very clean and comfortable with a small balcony providing a waterfront view. The location is perfect for waterfront activities as well as visiting the Pike Place Market. Walk out the front door and a Starbucks is right across the entrance from the hotel. I can't say enough about the professional and friendly service we received from every staff person we encountered during our stay. Marriott Waterfront Seattle - thank you for a most enjoyable stay!

<Content>Great View and Location Staying on the waterfront is terrific. The view was great. We had a balcony and spent time watching the watercraft of all sizes. There was also a concert accross the street. The hotel is close to Pike's Market--an easy walk. The Marriott beds are so comfortable.

<Content>Good Location, Nice Room The room was very nice...lots of space. The location is also good. Cruise ships dock right in front of it so it was fun to see which one was in port. The only negative I experienced was the front desk staff was not the most informative.

<Content>Excellent Room, Service and Location! Upon arrival at the Waterfront Marriott, check-in was seamless. I had requested a room closeby the elevator, and not only was it ideally located, the room I was placed in was wonderful. I had a corner room with two balconies and an amazing view of the beautiful waterfront and Mt. Rainier in the distance.The room was clean and comfortable. I ordered room service a couple of times and the orders arrived promptly. The Marriott employees were all pleasant and helpful to talk with. As for location - it couldn't be better. The waterfront restaurants and stores were all within walking distance. The double decker bus was located right across the street and stopped by twice an hour. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to go up to Pike Market through the elevator connected to the Marriott, but that alone was handy. And if you were to walk to the Space Needle, it would be a leisurely 20-25 min. walk or a quick 5 min. taxi ride (approx. $6).My stay at the Marriott was for 3 nights, 4 days and although I was there for business, it definitely felt like a quick vacation. Should I have the opportuntiy to come back again, I would love to stay at this particular hotel purely for its convenience and lovely experience.

<Content>Beautiful Marriott, excellent location This is a really beautiful hotel. The bed linens and the bed were absolutely heavenly! It is right on the water and just up the hill is the famous Pike's Market. There is a Starbucks right next door to the hotel. Excellent downtown location, tons of shopping (Macy's, Nordstroms, Nordstroms Rack, etc) nearby as well as wonderful restaurants. You should also check out Ohana's on 1st Ave, which is an excellent sushi restaurant/tiki bar (about a 7 min walk from hotel).

<Content>Location and Service Stayed for 3 nights at the Marriott Waterfront and couldn鈥檛 have been happier with this choice for location. I would definitely recommend this property for a Seattle visit.The hotel is one of a few that are right on the water offering up close views of the Sound. Pike Place market is literally a few blocks away (the elevator takes you up the hill). There are many restaurants along the waterfront and also near the Market within walking distance. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful 鈥?from the bellhops, to the front desk, to the concierge. The concierge was a great help in recommending activities and restaurants. The concierge floor was nice for breakfast/snacks. Activities - The concierge recommended a great place to rent kayaks on Lake Union. The free tours at top of Space Needle are very informative and worth the price of admission to the top. I would not recommend the Double Decker tour bus. It wasn鈥檛 really that informative. Ivar鈥檚 and Pink Door were our 2 favorite meals. Ferry to Bainbridge was nice, but there wasn鈥檛 much going on over in Bainbridge on a Sunday afternoon. Try to catch a game at Safeco.

<Content>Great Service Great Hotel I have to give this hotel 5 stars for the service I received. The staff was friendly and accomodatiing. I am a Marriott Silver member and they did give me access to the club floor because they did not have a king bed available, which is my preference.. They do a followup call to see if your room is ok. Little things like that keep me coming back to Marriott properities when I travel. I like the E shape or U shape of the hotel. You do not front the road that runs along the waterfront. Good design. It cuts down on street noise and you can still see the harbor. I love the infinity pool and the beds here. You are not centrally located for downtown but it may not matter depending why you are in Seattle. You are close to Pike's Street Market and if you are cruising this is one of your best choices.

<Content>Great hotel! This property was truly excellent! The room was clean, the view was excellent, and the staff were friendly. The concierge was excellent!!My only complaint was the pool scene. The pool was located in an odd location, and was not big enough for the people swimming in it. This was not a big deal to me, as I only used the pool once, and had no problems. This is a great hotel. It is clean, spacious, and the staff are kind and helpful. This is a great place to stay if you are planning a trip to Seattle or the surrounding area.

<Content>Just look at the water view! Recently stayed three weekend nights at this property. Overall the property is up to the chains's standards: clean, good bed, plenty of tv channels, etc. However, this property is not without its quirks.A previous poster mentioned the u-shaped design of the property wherein your view is that of your neighbor's room prompting closure of drapes of all times. This is not technically correct as the hotel is actuially E-shaped, so the chances of getting a room with a view of your neighbor is double!I had one of these rooms the first night and requested an outer-facing room for the remainder of my stay. I received a south-facing room on the seventh floor with a lovely balcony which afforded terrific views to the right of the water. However, looking forward, one's view was of the elevator/stairs to Pike Place Market. This is a much used access and is filled with families, business folks, vacationers and, sometimes, a couple of guys smoking crack (I assume) in broad daylight!I stayed on the concierge floor and can report that the lounge is decently equipped with all-day fruit, soft drinks, coffee and bottled water. Food presentations were unimpressive but tasty.The lounge itself seemed a bit small for the property, easily filled to capacity with guests (and this was a weekend). I saw many guests taking food back to their rooms because of the lack of seating.The lounge staff was intermittantly available but in general courteous and helpful. Some staff seemed less-than-well-versed in local restaurants and/or food quality as I was sent to place with the best prime rib that proved to be just about awful. The downstairs concierge seemed more knowlegeable albeit much busier.The hotel restaurant was very good. Staff were knowlegeable, wine selections thoughtful and food very good to excellent. Seems many locals come to enjoy the food and outdoor bar/patio.The waterfront location afforded spectacular views of the Sound and easy access to the cruise, ferry and tourist boat terminals. Also at hand are many trinket stores as well as many seafood restaurants (of which Elliot's is very good). Access to the main town is either via steps or elevators. And then you walk under a highway viaduct (strewn with garbage) and uphill a couple more blocks. So people with below average physical conditioning (or anyone late at night) should consider taking a taxi.Next time in town, I think I'll forgo the lovely view and stay somewhere a bit more centrally located.

<Content>One of the best Marriott hotels around - Seattle Marriott Waterfront This Marriott goes over and above the call of duty to take care of their customers; they know that you are a repeat (when you have been more than once). They bend over backwards to upgrade your room to a water view, everyone remembers your name, it has a great restaurant on property. They have a wonderful coffeee bar downstairs but also offer Starbucks in every room. Rooms are a little larger than the typical Marriott rooms and very comfortable.Great location if you are taking a cruise also....

<Content>Great stay We used points to stay memorial day weekend. We arrived at 10AM and they were able to check us into a good waterfront room (it appeared that the hotel was not very full). The staff were pleasant and efficient.The lobby was clean, spacious and had a good bar. We did not eat at any of the on-property restaurants as there are many great choices nearby. The rooms were typical good quality Marriott, and well maintained. The room size was decent for two people. The Concierge desk was very knowledgeable and helpful. The location was great for us - we love to walk and hills are not a big deal. There is an elevator next door to the hotel which goes up from the waterfront to Pike's market, but it was broken for the time we were there. We enjoyed walking to Pike's, around Bell Town (great restaurants, good music clubs.) Favorite restaurants included: Restaurant Zoe, Flying Fish.

<Content>GREAT experience!! My husband and I stayed three nights here...before we got on a cruise. I had no idea that there was a marina across the street from the hotel. We spent many hours just looking at the gorgeous yachts!! Our first afternoon there was one docked that had three decks and a Bell helicopter on the top deck!!! Wow, someone has a LOT of money! The bed/bedding was extremely comfortable!! We didn't eat in the hotel as I had so many restaurant recommendations from tripadvisor to try!! I'm planning on going back same time next year and I'll stay in the Marriott again!! Oh, another note, RCI and NCL use the pier directly across the street from the hotel....and I saw a hotel valet wheeling a cart of luggage down the sidewalk for a couple who were getting on a cruise ship!

<Content>Disappointed We stayed at the Marriott for one night in June using our points. While we had a room with a view of the water there was no privacy. The design of the hotel is U shaped and neighboring rooms looked right into our room (and us into theirs). A third of our window looked at the neigboring rooms' balconeys. Basically we had to keep our curtains closed at all times our smile and wave to the other guests in three or more rooms!Restaurant was okay but service at breakfast was terrible. We had the buffet but it took our waiter four tries to get us tea, coffee and juice. He mixed up our bill and we had to pick up our own custom egg order because he disappeared for 10 minutes while it sat under the heat lamp.The properrty is convenient for the Clipper to Victoria and Pike Street Market. But we would not return. Other properties offer better value and more privacy.

<Content>Awesome Bed! The hotel is nice and convenient to everything, including the markets and shops in the downtown district. The room was comfortable  quiet; it had a nice view and the bed was awesome; very comfortable. Previously, we had requested extra pillows and they had been placed on the bed prior to arrival. Earlier than expected check-in was greeted warmly. The staff were helpful and courteous. A last minute city tour booking was handled with ease. Room service was prompt, although they forgot part of the order and charged us for it. I called and they took the charge off our bill and then unexpectedly brought the remaining dish at no charge. Although booked by internet, we found the hotel through friends. The total cost for the night was $391 USD, which is probably in line for this part of the city.

<Content>Fabulous service, location, view. It has it all! I used my Marriott points for this stay. Marriott, unlike a lot of other hotels and airlines, treat you the same OR better if you are using your points for your room. Our room was beautiful with a fabulous view of the harbor. The room was beautiful as well.When we arrived, I was telling the front desk about our horror story with an airlines. They felt sorry for us, and gave us access to the Concierge Level!The lobby of this hotel is gorgeous. The location couldn't be better. I can't imagine going back to Seattle and not staying here. It just can't be beat.

<Content>Exceptional Stay I stayed here while attending a conference at the Bell Harbor conference center across the street. Overall the hotel was fantastic- it has a waterfront location and I was fortunate to have a room overlooking Puget Sound. As an early morning person, I was treated to sunrise views of the ferries and Olympic Mountains. That said, the location isn't the most convenient for first time visitors to Seattle. One one hand, its right on the waterfront and within walking distance to plenty of restaurants. On the other hand, some of the other popular destinations (Pike Place Market, downtown Seattle) are a good uphill walk.The room was very comfortable with a large desk for working. As a business traveler, nothing bothers me more than excessive charges for internet access. The room had a reasonable price for internet ($9.95) and internet access also included unlimited long distance phone calls on a cordless phone (nice touch).Breakfast at The Fish Room restaurant in the hotel was very good (if a little on the pricey side). Hotel staff were all extremely friendly and helpful.

<Content>Perfect location The Marriott Waterfront is a perfect location. We stayed in a waterfront room on the fifth floor. There is a lot of noise from interior doors slamming and you can hear people talking/yelling in the hallways. At one point we heard hotel security knock next door and ask them to quiet down. The bed was VERY comfy with great linens. Turndown service is provided upon request only. We requested turndown before going out to dinner and when we returned, over 2 and a half hours later, it had not been done. We called at your service and someone came, dumped a load of towels on the counter and refilled the TP. No turndown of the bed, empty wastepaper baskets, etc. We stopped at the front desk on our way to the lobby bar to ask if that was the Marriott standard turndown,which the reply was No. They asked if they could return to the room to complete the service, which they did. We ordered room service the first night there. We placed our tray outside and called at your service to tell them they could come and pick it up (this was after 11:00pm). At 9:30am the next morning when we left our room, it was still outside (along with other trays in the hallways). We booked a package that included breakfast at the restaurant. The second morning our food arrived over one half hour after we ordered and it was lukewarm, even more on the cool side. I could understand if the restaurant was busy or had a limited staff, neither of those were a problem. Valet parking does cost. However, they don't mind if you come and go, and were happy to go get your car for you. The Marriott is in a perfect location for walking or driving.

<Content>Seattle downtown waterfront Marriott The service at this hotel is way above avarage. Everyone treated us like we were special. I would stay here again. I was a little worried about the parking after reading other reviews, but the service from the vallet was excellent. It was a real pleasure to watch the cruise ship dock from our room.

<Content>Good hotel, good location, good service I stayed here for a couple of night recently for business and will be staying 6-8 times a year.The location is very scenic, by the water down town Seattle. Unfortunately everything else is uphill - but there is really only a steep hill to 1st Avenure (two blocks) and the shopping in from around 4th to 7th. 5 mins walking access to the Pike Place Market, surrounding restaurants and bars (check out Kells Irish Bar on Post Alley).The room is spacious and comfortable.I didn't try any of the restaurants, but the fish restaurant looks great and has a good reputation

<Content>Love the Marriott!!! "At your service" A very nice Marriott to stay at but they always are! Really comfy beds and nice clean rooms. It is very close to Pike Place Market a quick 5 minute walk and you are there. It is also close to transit and other tourist places like the pier, the aquarium and the ball fields. We walked from our hotel to Pacific Science center and it only took about 20 minutes. (there is a big hill to climb so if you are not into that you may want to take the bus.) The hotel staff are very knowledgable about the area and always willing to help. The restaurant is called the Fish House and is very very good! It is pricey ( $20-$36 US Per Entree) We went once in our week stay as a treat and a treat it was! Wonderful service staff and excellent meal! The breakfast was not included but you could get it from the restaurant meals ranged in price from $10.95-16.95 US. We found it more fun to walk to Pike Place market and go to Lowells or the Athenian for half the price. The only problem we encountered was the valet parking. It is $28US which is a bit more then other garages in the city but you do get in and out priveledges which you do not get at other garages. We were charged for our car as well as someone else's vehicle. The valet staff thought we were trying to scam them and they were demanding we pay! It was pretty good service up until that point. We found out that the valet service is a seperate company that the Marriott hires to do their valet( at this location) Once we got the front desk staff involved they were horrified by the treatment we were getting from the valet staff and they immediately sorted out the problem. The valet staff didnt even apologize for their mistake which we found to be annoying since we did drop a good amount of cash parking our car with them. Other then that small problem everything else was wonderful.

<Content>Loved the Marriott Wonderful hotel. Good location, great views, nice staff. I would definitely return.I called shortly after my arrival to inquire about the availability of a product in the hotel sundries store, and was told a complimentary supply would be sent right up. Nice touch.The valets were so nice, making you feel very welcome on your return. More often than not there were two to attend to each arriving vehicle, opening all doors. While waiting for a ride the valet even offered me bottled water.A very nice touch was the airline check-in station, with printer for boarding passes, next to the front door. The restaurant was very nice. The service was impeccable and the food tasty. We had a late night dessert and the buffet breakfast the next morning and both experiences were pleasant.One of the nicest things is the street elevator located just north of the hotel that takes you up from the waterfront to the next street. It's a pretty steep hill. From there it was a short walk to downtown shopping or trendy Belltown.Contrary to rumors that cabs are difficult to find, I had quick success with each attempt to hail a cab. But the downtown bus service is exceptional as well. I was a little worried about hailing a cab after the ballet, so the hotel arranged for a towncar pickup. The driver was waiting for me right on schedule by the front door of the Phelps Center on Mercer, and the price was only a little more than a taxi.I will definitely be staying at this hotel the next time I'm in Seattle!

<Content>Great location, family friendly I recently stayed at this hotel with my wife and 7 year old son. The location of the hotel is excellent, right on the waterfront and about three blocks from Pike Place Market - you go via a public elevator. There is a Starbucks opposite the hotel's front door. It has a unique pool, half inside and half outside and the water laps right up to the edge. The lobby is beautiful and has some unusual glass works of art. The only negative was one late evening we ordered dessert in the bar area, it took a very long time. I would advise against ordering food at the lobby bar. We did not visit any of the hotel's restaurants, there are plenty of places to eat in Seattle. The staff were excellent and made us feel welcome. The room was comfortable.

<Content>Great For Biz...Probably Better For Relaxation! Recently returned from a 3-night business trip to Seattle, with virtually all of the time spent across from the hotel at the conference center. This property does an excellent job of justifying what would otherwise be somewhat outrageous rates, given the deals that can be had in SEA. Their staff is very well trained, responsive, and friendly. The check-in was quick and smooth and garnered not only a large corner room, but also a key to the concierge lounge. I spend a lot of time in hotels, both here and abroad, and have never had bedding of the quality that this hotel provided. I even meant to tear the bed apart before leaving so I could read the tags on the sheets! But it was truly their staff that made the few days so pleasant; they are to be congratulated. Even to the point of their valet staff providing me with a bottle of water when I would take the car out. (I guess that is their way of softening the blow of a $28 daily parking charge!)Would I do it again? You bet.

<Content>Good place to stay before cruise We stayed here the night before going on our cruise. The location was perfect to get to the Celebrity pier. We just walked across the street. The room we were given had a nice view of the bay, and we could see our ship from the room. The room itself was clean and nicely furnished with comfortable bedding. We were able to walk to Pikes Place. The front desk was pleasant. We enjoyed the lobby bar in the evening. It was a nice place to start our cruise vacation.

<Content>Great Location My husband and I stayed at this hotel because of a trip we had to take to Seattle for his company. We probably would have chosen a similar hotel if we booked ourselves. The hotel is very nice and clean. It is in a great location down on the pier and has a terrific view. The employees are very nice and always have a smile and politely greet you in passing. My only complaint and the reason I didn't give it a 4 or 5 rating is that, in your room when you arrive is a menu for breakfast. Supposedly, if you fill it out and put it on your door knob before midnight, the breakfast you choose will be delivered to your room within a time frame specified by you. However, we filled this out and put it on our door knob 2 different times, and never had it picked up or breakfast delivered to us as we requested. The first time, I put it on the doorknob early in the day, because I had a full day planned and didn't know if I would make it back before midnight. When the maid cleaned the room she removed it from the door knob and placed it on the desk in the room. Needless to say, we didn't realize she put it on the desk, so we didn't get breakfast the next morning. How hard could it have been to have left it there? The next night, I put it out at around 11:00pm, and it was still there the next morning. They didn't bother to pick it up. Why offer a service, that you have no intention of providing. I would have thought this was an isolated incident, but a couple of weeks later friends of ours stayed here with the same company, and the same thing happened to them. They actually wanted breakfast delivered 3 days. After the first 2 request were not picked up, they complained to the front desk and at the same time ordered their breakfast for the next morning. When their breakfast was delivered, there were 3 days worth of breakfasts. When they checked out, the front desk tried to charge them for the entire 3 days worth of breakfasts. I probably would stay here again (on my dime), but would order breakfast through the front desk instead of using the door knob card provided in the room.

<Content>Very Good - not great My wife and I returned from a three night stay. This is a fairly typical Marriott as regards room accomodations, bedding, etc. The location is excellent; it is adjacent to the waterfront and close by Pike Street Market and other downtown activities (wear your walking shoes!). Noise from adjacent rooms (e.g. cell phone rings, loud conversation0 was a definite negative. Also, the room had a noisy ventilation system. We had a second floor room with a limited view of Elliott Bay; be sure to ask for a higher floor. This was an entirely satisfactory hotel, and I'd probably stay here again - but not before searching other spots.

<Content>Wonderful Marriott My husband and I stayed at this Marriott May 18-23 2006. Great location walking distance to Pikes Market and downtown. Room was lovely with beautful views of Puget Sound. Alaskan Cruise ships were there during our stay. Did not like like Todd English's restaurant The Fish Club .Food was not good and pricey. We did take a trip to Victoria on The Clipper which is walking distance also from the hotel. Highly recommend this hotel .

<Content>Great service and all round experience Wow what a great hotel. Very modern. Hotel had complimentary washer and dryer available on 2nd floor. Our room had a view of the ocean and we didn't have to pay extra for it. You couldn't get any closer to Pike's Market if you tried. Service staff is outstanding very impressive.The indoor outdoor pool and fitness facility is second to none in Seatlle. Truly enjoyed my stay and will be back again in November!!

<Content>Great hotel w/ Ideal waterfront location Great Marriot hotel. The location is nearly ideal. You're basically on the waterfront, so views from the rooms are great (higher floors obviously better). Also, it's just a short walk to pike place market and downtown (there are stairs/elevetor to get up righ next to hotel). Was initially planning on staying at another dt hotel (westin) since it was a little cheaper, but 100% content paying the extra to stay here. The location alone is worth it. Also, the Anthony's trio of places to eat right across the street is nice, have a fish n chips counter, middle range Bell Street Diner, and higher end Anthony's (was very good) all just across the street.Only negatives would be the doors are very loud when shut, try to avoid being next to the maintainence/houskeeping closets as the doors are loud when shut and you likely won't notice this problem. Other downside is the pool is pretty much a waste. It's very small and in a horrible location. If they had put it on the roof and made it an infinity pool... I'd given 5 stars, and probably stayed in the pool for the entire trip.Didn't eat at the fish club, but I'd say the same thing, they should have put it 8 floors up and had some of the best views on waterfront... again sure why they didn't.

<Content>Great room but questionable value Wonderful property and a fine experience. Excellent location. Food should be available in the lobby bar at all daytime hours and not with gaps between regular mealtimes. The room was very nice. The price, however, was high and I have to wonder about value for money here. I would gladly stay at this property again but would probably shop around the downtown area. SAFE TRAVELS - thedonk

<Content>First visit to this city Excellent views over Puget Sound, well worth having a room with a sea view to watch all the cruise ships coming and going.A good location as we could walk to many tourist attractions such as Pike Place, Space Needle, Pioneer Square or use the free bus along the front and the lifts to avoid the steep slope inland. Hotel staff were polite and helpful; rooms not large but had all you need, fridges being installed while we were there. Swimming pool disappointing; small and no sun after 4pm as located at the side of the hotel. Breakfast service good and the coffee/gift shop useful. I would definitely return.

<Content>Always love a Marriott We always love staying at Marriott Hotels Worldwide and this was no exception. The hotel is centrally located on the waterfront,with wonderful views. Loved the room- Marriott feather tops on mattresses, clean and well appointed. Only criticism was not enough towels were left and rooms were serviced so late in the day. Concierge was helpful, but most appreciated were the efforts of the bell staff and doormen who must field thousand of questions a day about directions. Loved this hotel and would not hesitate to go there again.

<Content>Nice hotel, great location My husband  I stayed at this hotel July 5-9, 2006. I loved the location of this hotel because it was right on the waterfront and was so close in walking distance to some nice sights/attractions. Mainly, I adore Pike Place Market, and this hotel allowed me to walk to  from there easily. We also loved the bedding used in the rooms. We did have an unpleasant experience at the get-go when we tried to check in - the clerk speaking with us said the system only showed us as having a reservation for one night, instead of 4 nights! This was a little annoying, but we figured it would be easily solved, so it was more the clerk's attitude that ended up escalating the situation and making us angry. She just kept insisting that whatever the computer said must be right, and did a poor job of handling the situation. It wasn't until the manager, who was standing nearby, came over that the problem was fixed, and then she was able to fix it quickly, and see our enire 4 night reservation. So it was unfortunate that our first impression as we checked into the hotel served to thoroughly anger my husband due to one clerk's attitude/incompetence. Some other semi-negative notes: I only saw a concierge at the desk once during our entire stay, the ATM machine in the hotel charges a fee of $3.25, and the laundry prices are outrageous. There are fortunately free washer  dryer available in the hotel, but be warned that the laundry room consists of 2 small washers and 2 small dryers, so you may have to wait awhile behind others, as I did. The only fee though is $1.00 for a box of detergent or dryer sheets. I wish our room had had a little better view (peek of water in the corner, otherwise view of other buildings  train), but overall I was pleased with this hotel experience. With the exception of the first clerk we encountered, most of the other staff we interacted with were helpful, and I thought the lobby entrance to the hotel, with the sparkling lights in the ceiling, were very pretty. The overall great things were the bedding and the location, right by the water, and close to things I wanted to see and do. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Friendly Hotel, Pretty Glass This hotel is in a great location. A very quick walk to Pike's Place Market, and even downtown or the Seattle City Center. The hotel appeared to be very new, and everyone, even the visitors staying there seemed friendly. The beds were very comfortable. Our family wished that the hot tub would not have been so small as to only accomodate 4 people at a time. It was the smallest hot tub I have ever seen. I also became disturbed after my husband pointed out the mold growing around the perimeter of the bathroom and coming out of the vent in the bathroom. Everything else about the hotel was fantastic, hopefully they will deal with the mold quickly, which we did mention to the front desk. This was a nice hotel all in all.

<Content>Great Location, Comfortable Rooms, nice restaurant We stayed at this hotel 6/21-6/24 2006. This hotel is down on the waterfront, near everything. Our room included 2 doubles with that fabulous Marriott bedding, including a small terrace. The view of the harbor was spectacular. No refrigerator in the room, but one was sent up at no charge. The small pool is indoor outdoor, partly in the building and partly outside. My eight year old daughter loved it. The Fish Club restaurant was excellent, if a bit pricey. We used Marriott flex anytime awards, which were 25,000 miles per day from American Express. These awards included a great breakfast buffet including smoked salmon and huge prawns. The room rate was about $330 per night, plus about $30.00 worth of breakfast, so the award was very good value. The free #99 bus/streetcar runs in front of the hotel and will take you up to within 3 blocks of the Seattle Center, which includes the Pacific Science Center and Space Needle, and direcly up to Pioneer Square. You can walk to the aquarium, and to the argosy cruise dock. An elevator immediately adjacent to the hotel whisks you up to the Pike Street market area. As another person wrote, park in the Wall street garage, near the World Trade Center East elevator. It takes you up to a walkway and then to an elevator down to street level, a few hundred feet from the hotel. This is $12.00 per day, vs $28 at the hotel. The bell people wil give directions if you ask.

<Content>Enjoyed Honeymoon at the Marriott Waterfront We stayed at the Marriott Waterfront -- received a free upgrade (from a waterfront view) to a room with panoramic views (from windows on 2 walls) of Mt. Ranier  the waterfront. The room  bathroom were nice  typical Marriott. Our only issue was with the curtains. They were thin, more like liners. There were no other drapes to darken the room, so with all the city  harbor lights, the room stayed pretty lit all night.The location was great -- we walked down to Pike's Market and along the waterfront. I would take the other reviewer's idea about alternative parking as the parking fees were pretty high here. We were here just part of 1 day, so we didn't have time to venture too much further out to see other sights.

<Content>Wonderful Stay at the Seattle Marriott Waterfront My sister and I recently stayed at the Seattle Marriott Waterfront. It was the most enjoyable experience. We stayed on the conceige level, paid abit more for this room but well worth the money. When we called the conceige line, it was answered prompty and were great with directions and bus schedules. Located along the waterfront it is within walking distance to all pier activities and Pike's Market. We felt very safe walking home from finner cruise at 11 pm. Would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Wonderfui if your budget allows Drop dead views of the Bay, easy walk to Pike's Place and any number of great restaurants and 4 star service.I attended a Microsoft conference held in the hotel. Decided that the $279 was justified as I would have paid any difference in cab fees or parking for a cheaper hotel and spent time in transit.Beautiful 4 star facility. Lobby is lovely. Bathrooms are well appointed - think marble counters and lots of space. Highly recommended if your budget allows, or if it is a business travel expense.

<Content>Sleepless in Seattle I'm reading some of the lavish reviews of the Marriott Waterfront and I'm wondering if the people who wrote them and I stayed in the same hotel. Yes, the Waterfront has a terrific view location and it's near the Pike Place Market. It's a relatively new hotel and the rooms are nice. But I'd never stay there again. Two reasons: Some significant flaws in the service delivery, and second, and more importantly, their utter indifference to my polite complaints about those problems.First, the flaws:A room heating system so loud I had trouble sleeping.No hot water for a morning shower.No shower caps or bathrobe in a premium hotelA big hole in the middle of a bath towel.Second, their reaction.When I went to the desk to check out ($379 for room, taxes, parking and a meal for one.), I politely mentioned to the clerk the issues above. Her only response was that I should have called down to get a shower cap. No apology. No promise to look into the situation and certainly no offer of even the smallest compensation. All the empathy I got from her was Sign here.I'm not a flagrant complainer, so I waited until the next day to call the hotel. I talked with the operations manager. He listened and promised to take up my issues with the manager. Its now been 10 days with no follow-up. No call. No letter. No expression of concern. I don't enjoy writing negative reviews, but I feel the disparity between the price I paid (in mid-winter) and the response I got merits recounting my experience. I hope yours is better.

<Content>A great location! The Marriott Waterfront is perfectly located, close to downtown and Belltown. A great place to base yourselves for a family vacation (we were very happy with the deal we received booking a package through the marriott.com web site -- airfare, hotel and car rental.)Unlike many hotels, this one was very quiet. We stayed five nights and never heard the folks on either side of us. The waterfront view from our room (652) was very nice, and the small balcony was a plus.You are in easy walking distance to Pike Place Market and some wonderful restaurants in the Belltown neighborhood. A great find was La Bella e Vita on 2nd Avenue between Battery and Wall. Or just walk across the street to Pier 66 (we'd recommend you stick to the first floor, which they call the Bell Street Diner. An excellent menu, very fresh fish nicely prepared and if you like micro-brew beer, try the Manny's on tap. You can't get it in a bottle so enjoy it while you can.For breakfast, the Fish Club in the hotel offers a great buffet for a reasonable $14.95 per adult ($7.50 for children) or order off the menu (check out the French Toast). But most days we just walked up the adjacent stairway to the Pike Place Market and dropped into the Le Panier French bakery. There is also a great little donut spot at the south end of the market -- about $2 for a half dozen mini-donuts that you just watched them make.One caution: If you are staying for more than a couple nights and have a car, you might want to park it for $12 a day in the Art Institute parking garage to the north of the hotel. Turn right out of the hotel, go up a block to Wall, turn right on Wall, turn right at the next light and head up about a block to the garage's upper entrance. If you park on that level, you can walk through the garage and take an outside elevator down to Alaskan Way and you end up about a half block away from the hotel. A bargain compared to the $30 per night for valet parking at the hotel.

<Content>Amazing View Our room at $219.00 per night was amazing, feather bedding, lots of pillows, starbucks coffee. Book the corner room #484, king bed, smoking, walk out only balcony. The views of Elliott Bay were breathtaking. Room service food was hot, however, they ran out of steaks on a Saturday night at 6pm.I will stay there again. Lobby was regal.

<Content>Review by a manager in the service industry As a manager in the service industry, I felt compelled to share my review of this property. We stayed 1 night with guests from California. From the moment we entered the Lobby, this hotel far exceeded my expectations. I would recommend it, without hesitation, to anyone staying in the Seattle area. The service was above and beyond; the rooms inviting and very clean; the view, breathtaking!

<Content>Wonderful hotel Just got back from 3 nights at this hotel and it was great. With it's waterfront location, fabulous beds, and outstanding service, this year old hotel is a good choice. They have 2 concierge floos that give you access to a lounge that includes breakfast, afternoon snacks, beverages, and evening deserts. We were upgraded to this floor, upon asking, at no extra charge because we are Marriott Rewards members. A definite plus. Concierge was very helpful in planning activites and dinner reservations. Our favorite meal was right across the street at Anthony's on Pier 66. They brought us a complimentary appetizer and said it was from the concierge at the Marriott. Very impressive. Will defintiely stay here again.

<Content>Great service and location We found both the location and service at this hotel to be excellent. It's walking distance to many of the sites and a good base for an intown getaway. The concierge, in particular, went out of her way to assist us with hard to get reservations and really made our stay enjoyable.

<Content>Great Place! We stayed here 1 night pre-cruise and it was great!! We had a 5th floor room overlooking the pool and a diagonal view of the water. NCL ships were parked directly across the street. Excellent location to the waterfront and Pike Place Market. Staff was friendly and accomodating. Bell boy even offered to push our luggage across to the pier...but we were leaving out of Pier 30. Excellent bathroom amenities. We managed an awesome government rate at this hotel...but even at full price, (atho pricey) I would stay here again!!! Previous posters complained of train noise...but we heard NOTHING!!! Great Place!

<Content>Not again Beutiful in lobby and but a disapointing experience. It is adjacent to a two track frieght line that really spoiled our sleep time. I'm surprised other reviews did not mention it. We were in a concierge room for this! Very surprised at the concierge evening snacks: chicken wings and salami like meat with some celery sticks. Just too much fat for us.

<Content>Great place to spend a night prior to a Cruise! Although we spent only one night at the hotel we found the experience very pleasant. My wife and I arrived on Saturday 09/03 and spent the night before we departed Seattle on the Sapphire Princess to Alaska on Sunday 09/04. We found the hotel staff, hotel restaurant and our room to be excellent! Our room package came with a breakfast on Sunday and transfers to our cruise ship.You are literally across the street from the dock if you cruise with NCL or Celebrity. In our case we took the shuttle (part of our package) to the Holland America and Princess Cruise Line dock (about 5-10 minutes away).Much to our surprise the hotel is very close to Pike Market (what a place!)and downtown shopping. The friendly and polite hotel staff gave great directions and tips for our short excursions in Seattle. In closing, all we can say is that we would stay at this hotel again on our next visit to Seattle. In addition, consider Anthony's Restaurant (across the street) for some good seafood. Happy Travels to all!!!

<Content>Marriott Waterfront- Mixed Reviews Positives... definitely location. Being on waterfront and near Pikes Market forinstance, beats being downtown at the Westin, Grand Hyatt, etc. where once you leave the hotel there's not much there.Negatives... as last poster said.. cold, impersonal.. just nothing special considering what it costs ($390 for our room on the Concierge level). Hotel looked like a hospital from outside--even drapes were green. Concierge lounge too small to accomodate all the 'elite members' fights for seats at breakfast.Question.. just what does it cost nowadays to get a really nice hotel/room. Used to be $300 was something.. now it's run of the mill.

<Content>Marriott Waterfront is an awesome hotel and great location My finance and I stayed at this magnificant property for a bit of romance and relaxation from out hectic schedules. The location is ideal for walking to all points of interest and attractions within the Seattle area. This includes Pikes market. We particually enjoyed dinner at the hotel's restraunt Fish. Food was spectaular coupled with a tranquil setting made for a relaxing evening after spending the day on foot. We give this property a five star rating. Staff was friendly, curtious and very eager to please. I might add facilities were spotless.

<Content>Waterfront Marriott disappoints We like Marriott's in general but were disappointed with this one. Although it's on the water, this Marriott was cold and impersonal. We felt it was really geared toward the business traveler and expensive for what it offered. Breakfast in the restaurant was outrageously expensive and on one day, the maid didn't make up our room up at all! I'd try something different next time.

<Content>Didn't know what to expect  I thought this was better than most JW Marriott Hotels. Good location--right on the water and near the Market and other great restaurants. Service was friendly and very helpful. Rooms were clean and up-to-date. This hotel is only 2 years old (found this out from the front desk) and it is clearly a demonstration of Marriott's efforts to be more competitive with the Westin hotels. I hope they upgrade their other hotels to this new standard.

<Content>Nice Hotel But Noisy Air Conditioning We stayed at this hotel over July 4th. Check-in was fast and pleasant. I had wanted a room with a direct waterfront view but the only one they had available had only 1 bed (there were 3 of us) and connected to another room (not a good idea I've found). We reserved a Concierge Level room and it was very nice. Almost all the rooms in the hotel have a partial water view. Our only complaint with the room was the noisy air conditioning. As it was warm in Seattle over the weekend, the air conditioning went on and off all night. There was a vibration and it kept us awake almost all night. In the end I don't think we would have wanted one of the direct waterfront rooms. There is an old streetcar which runs right in front of the hotel (like 10 feet from these rooms) and it rings its bell or blows its horn as it passes the hotel. It runs until very late at night.The Concierge Lounge was nicely stocked and the evening appetizers included hot and cold dishes. They also had a hot buffet in the Concierge Lounge in the morning, consisting of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage as well as all the other stand buffet items.I am surprised by the earlier posting by some folks who also stayed there over the 4th of July. I know the General Manager was on duty as he came into the Concierge Lounge to greet everyone. Oliver may have thought he was IT, but he wasn't. There was a fellow at the front desk who seemed to have an attitude, but I don't know if his name was Oliver.Other than the vibrating noise (which we reported on checkout), we had an enjoyable stay and would choose this hotel again.

<Content>Wonderful experience!! Great family hotel. We loved our stay at the Marriott Waterfront. When we booked our room we choose to upgrade to the conciergers level which included a view of Elliotts Bay. I believe it was a $25 upgade. After we checked in our kids were diappointed our room didn't have a balcony. One call down to the lobby and we were easily moved to a different room with a balcony. The upgrade also included the conciergers lounge which was awesome. The four of us enjoyed a generous breakfast, which was more like a full breakfast, not continental which it had been listed. We had access throughout the day to a frig. stocked with water, milk and sodas. Starbucks coffee was also always avaliable. In the evening nice appetizers were put out and drinks could be purchased for a reasonable rate and to top it off fresh baked cookies were always out around 8:00. Our teenage boys were in heaven. The concierge was always in the lounge to help with any questions we might have and make necessary arrangements. Margo is who we worked with the most and we couldn't say enough good things about her. I'm sure our upgrade had a lot to do with our experience but the benefits far out weighed the cost. Breakfast alone would have cost at least $25 for a family of four. We also took advantage of the business center, which is avaliable to anyone.The hotel in general was very clean, nicely decorated and the location is great. Everyone we dealt with was extremely pleasant. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>Very Disappointed We just returned from a 2-night stay at the Marriott Waterfront and likely will not return. We have stayed before and enjoyed the comfortable rooms and views, but this time we requested a room next to the pool to enjoy over the 4th of July holiday. As soon as we arrived and settled in, we went out to get in the pool and were shocked to see at least 3 young babies in the rather small pool, with diapers! We immediately called down to the front desk to ask their policy on this, and were told that someone would be up to our room to see us.Oliver, Front Desk Manager, arrived at our room saying they have no pool rules and that he saw nothing wrong with diapers in the pool. He was quite disagreeable and also said that whatever comes out of diapers is taken care of by chlorine, and that their paying guests were very important to them. We reminded him that we were also paying guests, to which he had no response. We asked to be able to speak to someone else, and he said he was IT. That was pretty much the end of the discussion.Needless to say, we had no desire to swim from then on and found the attitude disturbing, especially considering the potential health risks.We specifically chose to stay at this hotel for the holiday weekend for some sun, swimming and relaxing and left this hotel feeling no one even cared to hear our concerns or disappointment in not being able to use the pool. We are definitely not likely to return.

<Content>I don't think I'd go back In the lobby, this hotel may seem pretty elegant. Actually it isn't! My family and I had asked for a suite with two twins in one room and a king in the other. What we got was two kings. The mistake they made resulted with my young child sleeping with my wife, my teenager sleeping on the king and me sleeping on a pullout. It was extremely uncomfortable. Then when we had breakfast I found hair in my eggs. It was very unhygenic! I was discusted. From then on we ate out. I recommend this hotel if you're only staying for a couple days.

<Content>Great stay!! I really enjoyed my stay at the Seattle Waterfront Marriott. The location is great, right along the water and very close to the market. I enjoyed taking walks/runs along the waterfront. The hotel itself is very pleasent and is nicely decorated. An added bonus is that the hotel has a business center where you can use their computers with unlimited completely free access to the internet. What a nice amenity to have when traveling! I had a great experience and would recommend this hotel to everyone!

<Content>Excellent Honeymoon Experience Stayed at the Marriott Waterfront on each side of an Alaskan Celebrity Cruise for my honeymoon. The location was terrific, as it was only a block from the pier where the cruise ship docked.I can't say enough about the customer service at the hotel. Friendly desk staff, bellhops who not only took bags to our room, but also took 7 bags worth of luggage across the street and waited with my wife and I until the cruise company loaded them for boarding the ship.On the night before the cruise, the front desk graciously gave us a room on the 5th floor with floor to ceiling windows, a balcony and a stunning view of the waterfront. They also stored a bottle of wine we'd been given by our airline as a honeymoon gift that couldn't go on the ship with us.On the night after the cruise, we were in a room on the concierge level with a partial waterfront view. It still faced out towards the pier and the Marriott's courtyard area, providing a decent view. Our bellhop brought our luggage to our room, as well as the bottle of wine we had checked. Additionally, he went the extra mile and returned with two wine glasses and a bottle opener. Both rooms were clean, well appointed with amenities and had plenty of room for stretching out or doing office work if that's what you need. The concierge lounge on the 8th floor for business workers also had snacks and a very nice plasma TV if you needed to unwind a bit.Restaurant staff at the Fish Club was also very friendly from host to wait staff, attentive but not intrusive.The location is a bit far from the airport, as is all of downtown, but well within walking distance of many prominent Seattle attractions. A trolley runs right outside the hotel, which will take you to waterfront locations, and the monorail that goes to the Space Needle is about 6 blocks away (although it's a walk up a very steep hill if you go on foot.) Great customer service. Close to the Waterfront and Cruise Ship Piers. A short (but occasionally steep) walk to downtown attractions. It doesn't get much better than this.

<Content>Stayed here May 28 We really enjoyed our stay at the Seattle Waterfront Marriott. The room was very nice. The lobby was beautiful. Everyone was super nice  helpful. The hotel restaurant is Todd English's Fish Club. We had a very nice breakfast there. The service was also very good in the restaurant.

<Content>Fantastic Experience My husband and I decided to spend the night near the market in Seattle and picked the Marriott Waterfront mainly because of its location. We had a wonderful experience at your hotel from the moment we pulled our car into the entrance. The men that greated us, loaded our luggage and parked the car were very friendly and helpful. The person who brought our luggage to the room was extremely nice - showed us the in's and out's of the intertainment system, got ice for our drinks and gave us directions for finding the market as well as suggestions for dinner and breakfast. Our room was fantastic - I've never seen such a polished bath tub. The sheets on the bed were to die for - had to be 600 count! We had an excellant gourmet dinner in the hotel dining room as well as the best manhattans we've ever experienced! After dinner we moved to the lounge area and listened to beautiful piano music. We felt very special as the pianist played some of our most favorite music at our request. We were greeted by the manager while enjoying our after dinner drinks and wonderful music, he was extremely friendly and made us feel right at home. We both enjoyed the spacious feeling in the main part of the hotel and the music selections that seemed to surround you as you walked to and from the elevator were incredible. The whole experience for us was a memorable one - believe me, we will be back!

<Content>Nice view.....Nice room.....A little pricey...... I had a corner room facing the water and the view was spectacular. The rooms are very tastefullt decorated and, at least the corner rooms, are large. The employees are very friendly. Now for the stunning news. This room runs $200 per night,very pricey for what it is. What's even more stunning is the $26 they charge to park there overnight and there really isn't anywhere else to park. Thats gouging at it's best! Food and drinks are very pricey also.

<Content>Simply Stunning From my window I saw the bay, the moon and Mt. Ranier. The room was tastefully decorated and was more spacious than other hotels at which I stayed. It was a very pleasant time spent at this hotel, and I would recommend it.

<Content>Simply horrible... This hotel is a generic hotel with no character. On first glance, it appears to be somewhat elegant. But quickly you will see the hollow wooden doors, the extremely low ceilings (my head hits the exit signs in the corridors), and so on.This hotel is NOT waterfront, unless you consider waterfront to be 2 streets away from the actual water. Be careful, too... when booking, you may get a water view... since the hotel is shaped like an E (to afford the most rooms a view of the water), your view may be a tiny little sliver.The rooms are literally the smallest I have seen for a hotel of this caliber. They are a shoebox. The king size beds, in my opinion, have been foreshortened to fit in these depressingly small little rooms. (Oh, and for health club fans... don't bother. The health club is in what would otherwise be one of these small little guest rooms, with all of 5 odd machines. The ceilings are so low I was unable to use the stairmaster in the rooms.)Tomorrow night, I will move to the excellent Hyatt. (We stayed here because I thought that waterfront would mean a better setting... it doesnt.)

<Content>For the price, rather disappointing This hotel has the best location in downtown Seattle, and you'll pay quite a premium for it. I stayed here for New Years', because our party was across the street. It's quite expensive, one of the most expensive hotels in downtown, bar the really high-end ones like the Four Seasons or W.For the price, I was hoping for a bit nicer hotel. The rooms are TINY and rather poorly equipped. They did upgrade me at no charge to a waterview room, which was very nice. The view is lovely. However, the room is more cramped than a budget hotel, with a tiny bathroom, very little in the way of complimentary toiletries (I had to go buy my own toothpaste since I forgot it, for example - most hotels will supply things like that if you've forgotten them). There were no supplies at the coffeemaker, just a couple of opened packets. The beds are adequate, but be sure to ask for down alternative if you're allergic to down. Our room had only down pillows and comforters, which I'm rather sensitive to. The heating/air conditioning was noisy and difficult to stabilize at a comfortable temperature. The windows do not open unless you have one of the rooms with a mini-balcony. The windows look pretty much right into other rooms' windows, which is a bit off-putting (I had someone else's kids staring at me the second I opened our curtains).My major complaint is with noise. I always request a high floor, quiet room in any hotel. I got put in a room in the central hallway, which meant we had other guests walking past our room all night, and I could hear EVERY door in the hotel closing. Now, granted, this was New Years', and you can't avoid a certain amount of noise then, but the soundproofing is quite poor. I got to hear every detail of every drunken conversation in the hall and at the elevators, all night long. The doors SLAM like the 1812 overture. BANG!The lobby is very nice and the service quite good. The gift shop is nominal at best. Parking is costly (as it is everywhere downtown), but your parking space is not guaranteed if you use your car when the hotel is full. For the cost, your space should be guaranteed.The regular bathtubs are nice, much deeper than standard, and there's a light above the tub, which is a feature I wish every hotel had (I like to take baths and read in the tub at hotels).If this hotel cost approximately half as much, it would be a very nice place to stay. For the price, even with this location coming at a premium, I really expect a room a cut above what these were. They should have designed this with fewer, larger, better soundproofed rooms, and they need to make sure the room is fully equipped with toiletries and coffee supplies before guests arrive. The doors need to be properly adjusted so they don't slam loudly. Nothing puts me off a hotel as much as hearing doors slam all night.

<Content>Seattle Marriott-- A Very Nice Hotel My husband and I stayed here Dec 25  26 and thought it was a very nice hotel. Got a great rate of only $89 through the Seattle visitors burueau site and their Super Saver rates....we had a waterfront room. The room was large and the bed was SO comfortable! High-end bedding. There was also a nice comfy chair and ottoman in the room. Everyone on the staff, from the bellmen to the valets to the front desk, were beyond courteous--very freindly and helpful. $25 was a lot to pay for parking but with the low hotel rate it worked out OK. Finally, the location can't be beat as it is within walking distance to the waterfront, the ferries, the football and baseball stadiums, and great areas to explore like Pioneer Square and the Public Market.

<Content>i really like this hotel i stayed at this hotel for one night (12/29/04) on the top floor in a waterfront room. it was a beautiful room and a beautiful view. the windows created a great view south and completely west of my room. the balcony was nice to grab a quick smoke on, however, it wasn't covered which was a little bit of a drag considering how much it rains in seattle. as the hotel is still fairly new, everything still seemed new and clean - which was kinda like not feeling everyone has used or slept in the same place as you are -- i guess time will cure that ... i also loved the convenient elevator to get up to the street where the pike place market is on; it was like staying right at the market -- i couldn't believe how close the hotel was to the market .. i had thoughts of having to trudge up the hill or stairs. the staff was nice and courteous, check in was a breeze and the hotel was cozy and warm. although i was there for only one night, i'd surely stay there again. in fact, it would be my first choice and i've stayed in a lot of other places in seattle.

<Content>Not What Expected I had a reservation for the Seattle Waterfront Marriot in Seattle and I went to check in and they said that my room was not available (I had a discounted room) and that I would have to pay the normal rate. After I had already made the reservation. They were rude and I asked my manager and he was just as rude. Though the hotel was beautiful I thought the customer service was poor.

<Content>Location Location Location This Marriot hotel couldn't be in a better location . Imagine sipping hot Starbucks coffee on your balcony while watching seafarers enjoy Elliot Bay, or looking to the left at the magnificent Mt Ranier . The beds are the most comfortable I've ever sampled . How about those white glove breakfast buffets in the convenient  Fish Club  located next to the gorgeous lobby complete with a real fireplace and piano ? This Marriot can make a pauper feel they just switched places with royalty . Just outside the club take an elevator up to Pikes fish market ( what , 3 minutes away ? ) . Or the open air theater and Aquarium directly across the street with guests like Barbara Striesand -hello ! . Want to see the Space needle , ride the seattle ducks ( Awesome ! ) , or down the best Oysters at Three Coins ? We walked a few short steep blocks from the hotel both day and night and felt completely safe at all times . Did I forget to mention the old Shuttle train in front of the hotel or the Real Freight trains in back ? ( No, you cant hear them in your soundproof rooms ) . They even have a indoor pool that leads outside into the Seattle sunshine . This hotel was a $ 40.00 limo ride from the airport and a $ 10.00 taxi ride to the cruise ship . When we returned from the Princess Alaska cruise we stayed at the Marriot on a hill next to the airport and that was nice too . I would suggest this place to anyone . I cant imagine a more enjoyable stay elsewhere.

<Content>great place to stay We stayed at the Marriott Waterfront hotel for three nights, Oct. 18-21, and enjoyed everything about it. We selected the Marriott because it is the newest Marriott hotel and we used our reward points, but would stay there regardless any time. We were given a choice of either the 2nd or 6th floor, but after reading posts of other reviews, we knew better than to select a room on the lower floors due to the trains. The 6th floor room had two double beds, so we requested and received an upgrade from the 6th floor to the 7th (concierce level) floor with a kingbed. It came with a center view of the waterfront. Acquiring high speed internet access for our laptop was easy and efficient; for $9.95/day you also received unlimited local and long distance calling, a definite plus. Everyone on the staff that we encountered was friendly and professional. The hotel was very convenient to downtown shopping and dining and Pike's Market; we ate twice at the Bell Street Diner across from the Marriott because we enjoyed the casual atmosphere and the food was great. There is an elevator outside the Fish Club restaurant that takes you up one street to the public parking lot. From there, it is only one block up and two blocks north of Pike's Place and within those two blocks are Tully's coffehouse and Etta's restaurant and several art galleries. We could have forgone the $25 daily parking fee because we walked everywhere and didn't need the car. It was altogether a very enjoyable and positive experience.

<Content>Incredible Hotel and Unbeatable Location My wife and I stayed at the Marriott Waterfront for 4 nights in September 2004. We were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and our experience was truly outstanding. Our room had windows and balconies on two walls and overlooked Elliott Bay. From our room we could watch the ferry boats on the bay, see Mt. Ranier and enjoy the street scenes. The rooms are very well appointed, quiet and comfortable. The windows are made of thick glass and virtually soundproof the room from outside noises.The staff was courteous and attentive. They always greeted us (in a very unobtrusive way) as we departed/arrived back from touring. All of our requests were fulfilled promptly, professionally and with a smile.There is no need to rent a car as just about everything is within a short walking distance. Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, ferry boat terminal can be reached in a matter of minutes by foot. There is also a great trolley rail car with a station just a few steps from the hotel that can take you along the entire waterfront. We used the trolley to get to the Mariners baseball game.Finally, the indoor/outdoor pool, hot tub and workout facility allowed us to relax after a day of touring the city. In short this hotel had it all: great rooms, unbelievable location and a friendly staff. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel and look forward to a return visit.

<Content>Great hotel We recently stayed at the Seattle Marriott Waterfront and found the staff friendly and helpful, the rooms nicely furnished and the location within walking distance to several sights, including Pike's Market and directly across the street from Anthony's Fish Restaurant. We had a room with a small balcony and were able to leave our sliding door open if we wanted. We were on the club floor and the continental breakfasts and evening canapes were a very nice plus. We definitely recommend this hotel

<Content>Very Nice Stay We stayed at the Seattle Marriott Waterfront the week of August 16th and enjoyed our stay very much. The hotel is not large, but is well maintained and in a great location. It is true that a train runs behind the hotel, but we did not hear any train noise inside the hotel during our stay. 5 minute walk to Pikes Place Market and 10 minute walk to downtown. We experienced superb customer service through out our stay. Concierge lounge was small, but nice. Only drawback was $25 valet parking, but there really wasn't another viable option and we knew this going in, so not a big deal. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Choice!!! WOW! What a wonderful hotel! We stayed here for two nights at the end of a cross country trip that involved nine different hotels.The location is excellent. You are on the waterfront (there are only two waterfront properties in Seattle) about one block from the aquarium and across the street from one of the cruise ship docks. From this location we walked everywhere - Space Needle. REI, Pike's Market, etc.Because my husband is a platinum member, we had access to concierge lounge. Free breakfast items, afternoon snacks, evening appetizers and desserts. It was a very nice touch. Our room had a beautiful view of the bay and the skyline. Gorgeous at night. Lovely lobby, very friendly and extremely helpful staff. We truly felt welcomed and at home here.Only negatives were the hot tub at the pool area was not functioning properly and parking is $25/night but that is average for area. Minor issues compared to all of the great things about this hotel.We would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Nice Hotel, Bad Location I stayed at the Seattle Marriot for 3 days, August 9-12, 2004. Coming from Vancouver, I was surprised to find that Seattle has an industrial port. Since the hotel is across the street from the seaport, the hotel and its surrounding area can become very active with cruise ships and ferry passengers. Although the hotel is only 2 years old, it has some hits and misses. The hits: The rooms are very clean, including the carpets. The hotel has a nice interior and good rugs. The lobby is small but has a cozy atmosphere. The hotel has an upscale restaurant, if you like infusion-type food (lamb stew with oranges, for example). The gym facility is small but well maintained. The guest laundry room is clean, has well maintained machines, and is free of charge. The weekend staff (Wed to Sun) is professional and courteous. Now for the misses: overall the staff was, generally, not friendly but forcibly hospitable. There is a freight TRAIN that runs behind the hotel (the Santa Fe Express), and it's wheels squeak all night. In fact, I had to change my room because it ran right pass my window. This may also explain the reason each room has a dream machine (it plays soothing sounds). The pool and sauna area is small, the water a bit murky, and it needs a little attention. Next, besides the Edgewater Hotel which is at the other end of the seaport, this is the only hotel in the area. It can be kind of lonely walking there at night. Thank goodness for the trolley, which runs right in front of the hotel. Last but not least, there are no spa facilities in the hotel. You'll have to book your facial elsewhere.

<Content>Excellent hotel and restaurant! Stayed at the Marriott WF on Mothers Day weekend with wife, baby and mother-in-law (yes, two rooms...), and had an excellent stay. Staff was prompt, courteous, and had a great attitude. Rooms were excellent, and although booked on Priceline we got lucky and had great ocean views in both. The restaurant was also great (especially for a hotel restaurant), their Mothers Day brunch was just excellent.They offer valet parking only I think, so that's a bit spendy, but service was very prompt.I do 50+ business trips a year and stay mostly at Marriotts; this was the best Marriott I've been to and one of the best hotel experiences I've had period.

<Content>Very Nice Place To Stay Stayed here in May, 2004 for two nights after a one week Princess cruise to Alaska. Location is close to everything you would want to see in Seattle. Trolley is right outside the front door. Stayed on the Concierge level close to the elevators and the club. Continental breakfast in the morning included in the rate. Staff is very good. I cannot say enough about the concierge staff both on the ground floor and in the club. They were terrific helping us with tours, directions and reservations. Thanks to them we were able to see a great deal of Seattle and had a great time for our two days.

<Content>A Perfect Stay! I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in June 2004 with my family and several of my co-workers. We were greeted at check-in with friendly and courtesy staff members. Our rooms were clean and offered a partial view of the water. All the staff, from the front desk, house keeping, valet and especially the consierge staff were very helpful and friendly. A special thanks goes out to Margo and Hope who helped us with baseball tickets and other sightseeing tickets. Hotel is within walking distance to the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and the piers. We'll be back! I would highly recommend!

<Content>Excellent value Got a great internet rate, but as one would expect it wasn't a view room. Staff was friendly, rooms were spotless, well insulated against noise from outside and adjacent rooms, but noise did carry in from the hallway from less considerate guests. The hotel did handle the noise soon after I called at 1:00 am. Great location for exploring the city either by foot or public transportation.

<Content>Unfortunate Faux Pas I decided to stay at the Seattle Waterfront Marriott for a special weekend, where I was to propose to my now fianc茅. In deciding between the Marriott and the Edgewater, I chose the Marriott because they were able to guarantee the type of room I wanted specifically a Deluxe King room overlooking the water a very romantic setting with wraparound windows. (The Edgewater claimed that while I could specify a water-view - the room size, location and balcony, etc. were all first-come first-serve at the time of arrival).Prior to the trip, I contacted Marriott several times to confirm the reservation and the room selection. However, when I arrived at the hotel with my fianc茅e, I was disappointed to learn that we had been moved to a standard room, and all other room sizes were booked.I can not complain about the hotel itself or the service, (the desk manager did compensate us for one of the nights after some argumentation - luckily I had with me a written confirmation of my reservation, including the room type), however I was very disappointed that this happened on such a significant occasion, when I had spent so much time researching our place of stay and verifying our plans.I really relied on the Marriott reputation for service and class for my proposal weekend I felt the splurge for this hotel would be worth it in order to insure that everything would be handled well. It s a shame that they didn t live up to expectations.
