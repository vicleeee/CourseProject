<Content>nice location, nice hotel We stayed at the Casa Fuster for 5 days and enjoyed it very much. Nicely located in the city at the end of the passeig de Gracia, the exterior of the hotel is very nice. Staff was helpfull, roof terrace was very nice, great views of the city.The room was wonderful, spacious, very nice bathroom, good beds.All in all very good, maybe only the prices in the bar could be a bit more sensible. But I guess that's part of the 5 star status*

<Content>I agree - not 5 star I have rated this hotel 2 star only because it falls so short of the five star it claims. I stayed with my wife for one night prior to a cruise from the Port on a ship that WAS almost 5 stars the brilliance of the Seas. The Good: Concierge staff and reception, friedly and professional.The Building: Excellent and in a good location.The Room. Comfortable and well furnished. Public Areas: Well furnished if a little gloomy, due to 'atmospheric' lighting.The Problems: We retired early (10.30pm) after along day travelling to meet our cruise. We were woken by the dreaded mobile phone being used at full throttle by a memberof staff in the corridor outside our room. Resolved this by getting out of bed and remonstrating.We were next woken at about 3.am by revellers returning to the hotel. Repoteted this to reception 3 times before action was finally taken.Breakfast: is a joke for a 5 star hotel. It is now taken in the dining room and the 'hot' section is not kept hot, althogh the cold section has a decent variety. Another problem here is that the meal is taken on low (cabaret drink type) tables making for an uncomfotable experience.En suite: This is my main gripe, the bath/shower is now very old fashioned and looking very tired. I am sure that when it was first built it was at the edge etc. But now it is out of date, in my view a little dangerous to step out of the quite high sided bath after a shower requires more a lot more care than it should (I slipped, and my balance, weight posture is very good).Friendly professional staff are up to the job, there are now better quality and value hotels to be has in Barca.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel This really was a great hotel. It's beautifully decorated, and the service was real 5 star service. Right from the moment we arrived we felt welcome. There was no stuffiness, the staff were very professional, and very friendly.The rooms were lovely, just the right size, and free internet connection in the room which was a bonus. Shower was excellent. Location was great too, we walked everywhere from here!

<Content>Very Satisfied We stayed in this hotel at the front end and tail end of a cruise. This is a beautiful hotel with unbelievable service - from their custom pillow menu to their bed turndown service. (note- do not use the do not disturb sign on the door if you want to take advantage turndown service , because they will not disturb you for any reason...PERIOD!! The room, although smaller than comparible American hotel rooms, was impecibly decorated and furnished. The room bar was fully furnished (but a tad expensive - even by European standards)We traveled with relatives but they didn't share the same experience (some construction jackhammering was occurring outside their room during the day) , but I'm sure the hotel would have changed their room if they would have complained to the hotel staff. All staff were fluent in english as well as other languages. The doorman even greeted us by name when we went out for dinner (amazing since we never gave him our names)! When we requested to have a 7:00am taxi night before we departed (which can be difficult in Barcelona as there is sometimes up to a two hour wait for Taxis), they had two of them right on time - waiting for us (about 30 Euros from the hotel to the airport and visa versa)This hotel, while not being on La Rambla, is in a perfect location. It is only a few hundred meters to many architectural landmarks - yet is not on a busy street. Walk out the doors and you can immediately shop for Gucci bags or Valentino dresses (Yea, right! - but it is nice to window shop - as they are truly beautiful garmets). is only a 20 minute romantic stroll along outdoor cafe's, bakeries, eateries and shops to reach La Rambla.The food from their resturant was fantastic, however the breakfast buffet was probably the best I have ever experienced. Imported cheeses, specialty hams, sausages, breads, coffees - even specialty diet foods (low fat preserves, crackers, cereals), etc., or you could just have a normal cooked to order meal such as an omlet. We had a most pleasant stay there and will definately stay there again when we return to Barcelona.

<Content>Historic building in an excellent location! Casa Fuster is located in the most fashionable section of Barcelona - an amazing location, close to shopping and all major Gaudi sites. The building itself is historic and absolutely breathtaking. Since the hotel is located on a major street, and, this being Spain - where dinner is served from 10pm onward - I would suggest you request a room that does not face the street. Mind you, the noise is not overbearing, but it may be too much for light sleepers. The lobby bar/restaurant is beautiful. Stop by for a glass of cava and feel oh so cool. Food is also quite good. One drawback....the electrical outlets and closet space (or lack thereof). There was only one outlet in our bathroom. This meant my husband and I could not get ready for dinner at the same time. Closet space was minimal. Still, I would return. The rooms were clean and well appointed. Location is amazing!

<Content>Amazing building Booked Casa Fuster via Expedia where they had a very good rate. I was concern they would give me a bad room as a result of the low rate but that was not the case at all. I had a nice corner room. The building is amazing and has been refurbished to very high standards. Breakfast is in a very nice room downstairs but is does not have windows so you may want to consider getting breakfast elsewhere.

<Content>Exceeded expectations Absolutely nothing but praise for this first class hotel. The location was perfect and having booked through What a Hotel found that we had the most amazing upgrade and lots of little touches that just make the difference between a good hotel and a luxury hotel.We ate in the main restuarant and the food was excellent.Nothing was too much trouble and the staff were exceptionally courteous and friendly.Having researched many of the hotels before we went, I am just so pleased that we picked Casa Fuster and would advise anyone else to do the same!

<Content>Not a Five Star Hotel The Halekulani on Waikiki is a five star hotel. The Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo is a five star hotel. Hotel Casa Fuster is not a five star hotel. There are three areas that make this hotel less comfortable than a Marriott.First, the design. We had a Junior Suite. There is a lttle extra room, but no curtain between the sitting area and the bed. I dragged a chair into the hallway to read while my husband was sleeping. Where do they expect you to put your clothes? There is no armoire. There are no dresser drawers. There is a very small closet that wasn't tall enough to hang even my shortest dress. It is filed with extra pilows and blankets and the totally uncomfortable hemp robes. I had a hanging bag that I attached to closet door, then had to stand on a chair to access. The rest of my clothes had to remain folded on top of a suitcase. They could have put a dresser where the totally unnecessary second television is jammed next to the bed. Exactly how were we supposed to watch the large and expensive main television? In front of the main television is a HUGE, heavy three foot round unmovable table. I stubbed my toe on it several times, but could not move it more than an inch or two. Others have mentioned the archaic keying system. There is only one key so my husband and I could not explore on our own without elaborate plans about who would be in the room and awake. That key is necessary to turn on the electricity. That means your room will be VERY warm when you return, since the air conditioning will be off the entire time you are gone, Don't expect any electrical outlets in the bathroom. I ended up curling my hair on my knees against the tall wall mirror in the bedroom. Yes, there is internet access in the room, but it took me three days to find the plug hidden behind the desk. And you better have taken your own ethernet cord. There are no instructions that access exists or how to use it in any of their literature. I spent an uncomfortable time using their reception area WiFi, because there are no sofas or tables in the lobby. just some beautiful wooden chairs.The second fault is the lack of maintenance. Three times we had to return to the front desk because our key failed to work in our door. The bathtub was a deep whirlpool tub, but the OFF switch and the volume adjustments did not work. You got a rather ineffectual splashing if the water was over two or three inches. Our room contained a permanently on lamp right near the bed. The only way to turn it off was to pull the plug. The room was so dark that you will need to get on your knees and plug in the lamp again when you are awake.The third fault is the unprepared concierge. We wanted to buy a Barcelona Card (free Metro and buses, discounts to museums) and even had a picture of it to show them. They tried to tell us where to buy a Bus Touristique card (a sad transportation system with lines an hour long even in October). They totally underestimated the time to walk to Sagrada Familia and the direction to take. They always seemed surprised that our key didn't work. They must know their system is flawed.I do want to say a few nice things about the hotel also. The bed and linens were very nice. The room was relatively quiet, if you didn't mind the children screaming in the playground next door during the day. The location was perfect for exploring the Eixample, the neighborhood with the most Gaudi buildings, and was very convenient to the Metro and several bus lines. And the best part was the hotel restaurant, Galaxo. We ate there because we were too tired to go elsewhere, but we should have gone there prepared for a feast. The food was spectacular.

<Content>Great personal service One of the best hotels I have stayed in for years. Everything was spot-on from the moment we arrived at the front door. The servce was very personal and nothing was too much trouble during our three day stay.The rooms were very comfortable and the 'pillow menu' impressive. Im usually very critical of service and could not fault the hotel and its staff in any way. Before I booked I had read previous reviews and somone recommended usng 'whatahotel.com' . I found this US companys website exceptionally user-friendly. Their electronic communication was efficient considering we were arriving only 12 hours following the booking. We also saved over 50% on the room rate compared to other well know UK sites. Its not often you can say this these days but all in all a very good experience and we will be definately going back.Gents - you will certaintly score some serious 'brownie points' with this choice of hotel.

<Content>Loved the Casa Fuster Hotel We were thrilled to stay at the Casa Fuster Hotel! I accompanied my husband on a business trip, where the hotel arrangements were made for us. The hotel location was great, for easy walking to most of the city sights, and in a very nice quiet safe area. Our room faced the inside courtyard, and was extremely quiet and comfortable. The staff was very helpful and spoke English very well. One favorite restaurant nearby was La Pomarada - great food at very reasonable prices, with excellent attentive service. The restaurant is about a 5-minute walk down the street. from hotel, at Passeig de Gracia 78. I took a full day trip by bus, to Girona and Figueres, to explore the Dali Museum. I highly recommend this trip, sponsored by the Barcelona Tourist company. Highlights in Barcelona: guided tour of Palau Musica, Sagrada Familia, Casa Mila, Picasso Museum, Cathedral and cloister, Park Guell, Joan Miro museum at Monjuic. We walked everywhere except to Park Guell and Montjuic - very reasonable taxi rates.

<Content>Great Location We treated ourselves to a short break in Barcelona. What a city! The Casa Fusta Hotel was a perfect choice for 2 nights. Slightly on the expensive side but a perfect treat. We loved the rooms, very comfortable furnishings, Jacuzzi in bathroom, great views over city from the balcony. The staff were great, perfect English which was a plus considering my Spanish is atrocious! You just couldn't beat the location. I would definitly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Perfect romantic break I booked this hotel as a surprise birthday present. Location is very good, just at the top of the high end shopping street (Gracia), and walking distance from many of Barcelona's main sights (Gaudi buildings, las rambla etc). The beach is a short taxi/bus ride away.Initial impressions were very good - amazing building, set just off a busy road so not too noisy. Bags were taken at the door by attentive staff. Check-in was very good and quick. We arrived at around 230 and were taken to our room straight away. Clerk also immediately gave us a map with the hotel on it and briefly explained it's proximity to local points of interest which was a nice touch.Room on the 5th floor was very nice with high class furnishings and large comfy bed - not huge in area, but then that doesn't really bother me. Beautiful views over La Familia and the city from the balcony. The bathroom was huge, with double sink and great whirlpool bath.Turndown/cleaning all done well and around our timing. Complementary water was nice, and bathroom kit was first rate. Also notable is the sound-proofing. There appeared to be a local festival one night, but we couldn't hear a thing! Downstairs bar is very pricing, but also very nice for (probably only one) drink. Concierge was also excellent, and recommended a very good restaurant in the mountains.Overall an excellent hotel.

<Content>Sophisticated Charm We stayed one night here before a Mediterranean Cruise. The staff was very helpful and could speak English well. The hotel is kept very clean and the building and its鈥?d茅cor are impeccable. Our bathroom was all marble 鈥?very clean. However, we did have a problem with water getting on the floor when we took a shower because of a lack of a shower door. You have to use your room key to turn on the power in your room on 鈥?great energy saving feature! We ate breakfast at their downstairs buffet 鈥?it was the best breakfast buffet 鈥?very classy and lots of choices no matter what you鈥檙e in the mood for. The king bed was two twins pushed together鈥?it didn鈥檛 bother us 鈥?we just figured it was a European thing鈥ot really sure. However, we found them quite comfortable. The only complaint besides the minor shower door issue was the price 鈥搘e paid $600 US dollars for one night 鈥?it was nice but not sure if that price was justified鈥he room was quite small. As for the surrounding area鈥here is a nice little coffee shop just down the street we visited. They tell you are within 15 minutes walking distance to Sagrada Familia 鈥?however we found the walk to take more like 30 minutes鈥he hotel is about 3 or 4 blocks from one of Gaudi鈥檚 more famous buildings. I would defiantly stay here again if I could get it a little cheaper鈥?/p>

<Content>I wouldn't stay anywhre else in BCN I love Casa Fuster and the wonderful staff there.The only negative thing is the breakfast room. I am nottoo happy starting my day in a 'more suitable for a disco' -lookspace located in the basement with a staff consisting of lazy daydreamers and paying a lot for this 'fun'.Nevermind....there is a coffee shop with outdoor tables just across the entrance. There You can have a sunny start for your day.Special thanks for all the ground floor staff! Best service ever!

<Content>Exudes class  Casa Fuster exudes class, style and superior service 鈥?but as with anything in life you get what you pay for. We stayed at the Casa Fuster for three nights April 25-April 28 2008. We had a bit of a lesson in supply and demand as the weekend we were there was the same as the F1 race in Barcelona and so room rates were higher across the entire city. And so it is鈥?Anyway we are middle class folks but like to stay in quite nice hotels when we travel (and don鈥檛 mnd paying for it), but I think you鈥檒l find some fairly practical comments relative to the hotel and its amenities. The hotel is optimally located at the top of Passeig de Gracia. One simply cannot beat the great shopping up and down Passeig de Gracia. It was a 5 minute walk to the Casa Mila, our first tourist stop one morning and a Bus Turistic stop as well. As someone else noted its about 10 mins give or take to Placa de Catalunya. There are some very nice restaurants within 2 minutes of Casa Fuster including Fernandez (where we dined one day for lunch) and El Toc de Gracia (where we dined for dinner 鈥?the hotel recommended the place). Cervesseria Cataluna was a 10 minute walk and a great dinner one evening as well. Hotel Majestic is in an even better location a bit further down Passeig de Gracia but I cant comment intelligently on that institution as we never set foot in there. We arrived at 1 PM on a Friday and were immediately checked-in. We had a reservation for a standard room and we were given Room 412 facing Passeig de Gracia with a decent view and a very small balcony.Because of the building鈥檚 historic landmark status, the rooms were not allowed to be expanded at all and thus space is definitely at a premium. In the standard room we had to move the chaise over a few feet just to open the balcony door, then slide our way through the balcony if we wanted to catch some fresh air. Having stated that its not as if the balcony is truly intended for spending significant amounts of time out there. We had to step around our suitcases just to get in and out of bed. If there is a next time we would definitely pay for a larger room. The bed was a true double and very comfortable, the pillows plush. There was a small desk and a flat screen TV just above the minibar. The closet was large enough and we managed just fine. The bathroom was very nicely done in marble and complete with bidet and his and her toiletries. We were religious about using the room safe and had absolutely no issues with any lost belongings or anything of the sort. As a matter of fact I will state that Casa Fuster provided an overwhelming feeling of safety relative to the Las Ramblas area etc. You could just feel you were in a better neighborhood and the staff acted accordingly. We tipped the maid one morning and noticed a difference in the level and timing of service (room cleaning and turn down) the next day 鈥?not sure if there is anything to that or not, just an observation. One gripe 鈥?the hotel claimed to have an iron (I checked before we left the US) in the room 鈥?not true. We arrived to find no iron in the hotel room (much to my fiance鈥檚 dismay!) and as with many luxurious European hotels, the hotel would not furnish one. Instead the hotel offered to press any item of clothing through its Laundry/Press service. The hotel charges 10 Euros to press one pair of pants, as an example. This is what one would expect for a high end hotel and so we do not mean to be talking out of both sides of our mouths 鈥?just thought there should be an iron when advertised as such. In retrospect it turns out that the Travelocity website noted the Casa Fuster provided an iron, not the hotel website itself. The rooftop terrace was very nice 鈥?we enjoyed a drink or two up there one pleasant afternoon and soaked up some 70 degree sun while admiring the view. As with most hotel pools in Barcelona 鈥?the rooftop pool did not impress at all 鈥?it is a tiny footpool by American standards. We then walked over and fell asleep for an hour or so in the lounge recliners on the roof. Very relaxing.If you are into exercising/working out, please don鈥檛 be too misled by Casa Fuster鈥檚 boasting of an exercise room. We are talking about one treadmill, one bike and a bench with no weights. Don鈥檛 get me wrong, the treadmill did its job just fine and there is a flatscreen TV in the small fitness room to boot. However there wasnt much equipment is all and had there been someone else wanting to exercise at the same time I wouldn鈥檛 have been altogether pleased. The sauna is a tiny room just off the exercise room. By far and away the most admirable trait of the Casa Fuster was its staff and service. The staff was absolutely fantastic, especially when compared to the Hotel 1898 (where we stayed for the next three nights). You leave your key when you depart the hotel (you should see the size of these things, remarkable :) and the staff will do their best to accommodate any request one has. The services provided to us ranged from: recommending casual, local restaurants as well as booking restaurant reservations at places like Arola et al, changing money at the front desk, providing information on local attractions such as Bus Turistic, Montsterrat, printing out the train schedules for us, booking a rental car, you name it really. On our last day there the staff held our luggage for 4 hours while we shopped and prior to our departure for Hotel 1898. Hailing a taxi was no problem through the equivalent of their bellboys and even the lowest ranking staff member truly seemed to be informed and happy to assist. I guess that is the point 鈥?many hotels offer such services but the folks here seemed to do it with a smile. Again I make these statements in comparison to the Hotel 1898, which was much more of a 鈥榳e provide some info, you do the rest yourself鈥?type of feeling. Would we stay again? We probably would. For the feeling of a fantastically constructed 5-star hotel and the service it provides. there is no mistaking the architecture and history. However, I would likely first explore other properties like Hotel Majestic or Claris (acknowledging Claris is a step below Fuster). In the end, no real complaints, we loved Casa Fuster.

<Content>casa fuster-another great barcelona hotel Casa Fuster is a 5*GL hotel with prices to match. We did an air miles deal, so did not pay cash to stay.The hotel is 12 minutes walk from Plaza Catalunya, just north of the Diagonal-not totally central, but not too far either.The architecture and design is cool, Catalan and classy.Soem will say too dark, but we thought it atmospheric.The room was small but beautiful.The bathroom was remarkably large, but with no bidet and a shower along the side of the bath, it was not well thought through.The freebies were the best we have ever had in any hotel.Breakfast was superb, except the tea made with luke warm chlorinated water!Overall we had a great stay, but for the money, we would chose 1898 or Les Arts any day.

<Content>Beautiful hotel I just come back after a weekend spent in Barcelona at Casa Fuster. I loved it, the entire concept. Architecture and design of the hotel is quite special. Room was spotless and breakfast excellent. Staff speaks fluently English and they are really helpfull. Special thanks to Mircea (concierge) which was really helpful (my friend lost her mobile and they delivere it in 20 minutes to the airport). We also enjoyed the sangria served at hotel's bar. About the location I have to mention that hotel well served by public transportatinon (metro is 100 m away) and 2 stations away from Plaza Catalunya.

<Content>Classic and Sophisticated Beautiful, elegant, and sharp. Casa Fuster was incredible. I loved the decor of the rooms, although I found the beds a little less than average considering the caliber of the hotel. It was conveniently located close to a lot of the major sights of Barcelona. The staff was friendly and spoke english (my spanish is horrible). Overall I had a pleasant experience and would stay there again.

<Content>top notch What can I say that has'nt already been said about this gem of a hotel.My wife treated me to a short break at the CF for my birthday what a treat it was.From check-in to departure there was'nt a thing that could be faulted,exemplary service, spotless, helpfull and knowledgeable staff and all the thoughtfull little things like the upgraded room with a spectacular view towards Las Ramblas the fruit and chocolate platter hand piped with 'happy birthday'and the bottle of cava made our stay a very memorable one.We never paid any where near the rack rate for a room at this hotel which is what makes the treatment we received all the more special.All in all a truly memorable experience.Thank you to the staff and Management

<Content>Expensive but lovely hotel We booked the room in a Spanish discount site called www.atrapalo.es and got a great deal compared to the advertised rack rate, about half price if I remember well.The hotel is a bit away from the action. It didn't bother us as the walk was quite pleasant and it also meant that the area was quiet at night. Food can be found in the streets behind the hotel, Gracia neighbourhood. Very authentic with far fewer tourists than Las Ramblas or El Barrio Gotico.The building is gorgeous and not too far from 2 of Gaudi's most famous buildings.The rooftop bar and plunge pool are beautiful at sunset. Great place to relax with a drink after an afternoon about town.The rooms are nice, maybe a bit small for the price but quite modern and elegant.The bar close to reception is very nice with a modernista feel. They had jazz concerts when we were there.Would definitely recommend it.

<Content>A top choice in Barcelona I spent two nights at the Casa Fuster from 26-28 November. I had spent two nights at the Hotel 1898 on Las Ramblas before checking in to the CF, and although a night in a Standard room at the CF was 110 Euro a night more expensive than a Superior room at the 1898, the CF truly is in a different class than the 1898 and is worth the extra money.I should say however that a local travel agent quoted me a rate of Euro 240/night inclusive of breakfast at the CF for the weekend of November 17th, but I ended up having to change my travel dates due to work. For the days I traveled 鈥?even though I did not stay at the CF on a weekend 鈥?were much more expensive 鈥?at Euro 330/night not including breakfast. Obviously, it would have been great to get the cheaper rate, but I would pay the higher rate again for a chance to stay at the Casa Fuster where the service and the accommodations are truly top notch. Let mention that I have a love-hate relationship with large hotels. I like the hustle and bustle of crowded lobbies and get kind of depressed when I am staying at smaller boutique hotels that have empty-ghost town lobbies. That doesn鈥檛 mean I am a fan of large numbers of tour busses dropping off tourists to gawk and gape while they wait in line for afternoon tea. Still, my second impression of the CF (the 1st being the absolutely stunning building exterior 鈥?wow!) with bellhops coming and going and groups congregating all over the lobby was 鈥渘ow this is a real hotel鈥? I would say that the CF and the 1898 are of similar size, but the lobby of the CF was much more lively than the 1898 although they both had high occupancy during my stay. The 1898 does have a somewhat larger lobby however so this may account for why it seemed so sparkly populated. After check in I decided to walk around town a bit. Of course, the first thing I noticed as I was walking back up Pasaig de Gracia towards the hotel was a Large grey tour-bus parked outside the hotel. Oh well. Guess you cant have the crowded lobby without the obligatory tour bus parked outside. Still, this lobby was crowded in the way I enjoy so I cannot fault it Although I expected the Standard room at the CF to smaller than the superior room at the 1898, the room at the CF had a very, very large, luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent of the bathroom at the Hotel de Russie in Rome. I think the bathroom is the most important part of a hotel room and would gladly give up extra room real estate if it would buy me a larger bathroom. You could comfortably fit two people in this bathroom which I appreciated even though I was traveling alone.In fact the entire CF reminded me of a smaller version of the de Russie. Something about the decor, and the layout of the hallways though I can鈥檛 put my finger on it. I did have a minor problem with the shower 鈥?either there was no shower curtain or glass panel to keep the water from spilling all over the place, or I just count figure out how to use it, but I ended up making a minor flood in the bathroom that I had to use up all my towels to dry up. Thankfully when I returned to my room the attendants who had done turn-down service had replaced my wet towels with fresh ones.Although the CF felt from the start like a real deluxe experience, it proved itself to be such on my very first night there. After a long day of sightseeing in the area around Palau Nacional I wanted to enjoy a glass of wine in the Lobby bar before heading off to dinner in town. Regretfully, there was a private event going on at the time and the gentleman at the front desk apologized and offered to have me served in the upstairs library-quite area which I happily accepted. Shortly after finding a place to sit where I could write my postcards a waiter appeared to take my order. When he returned her informed me that the glass of wine was 鈥渙n the house,鈥?which could not have made me happier. Very unexpected and very, very nice. Skeptics might say that a small gesture like that is not worth the extra Euro 110/night over my other choice for accommodation, but to me it makes all the difference.I did eventually make my way to the lobby bar after midnight where I enjoyed a glass of Cava, finger foods, and deserts. The later was on the pricey side but no more than I expected to pay at such a fine hotel.Although I would stay at the 1898 again, if I budget was not a constraint I would choose the CF hands down. You pay more, but you get so much more. This was my second trip to BCN and some of the TripAdvisor members warned that the area has become a lot more touristy than in it was in 1997, I didn鈥檛 really find that to be the case. Still, L鈥橢ixample is not all that far away from Placa Catalunya and Pasaig de Gracia is really so nice to stroll along 鈥?leisurely or otherwise. There is no reason to stay on Las Ramblas. Even if you are not a walker, the Diagonal Metro station is only two stops form the Ramblas. A note of caution for those of you who only travel by car or taxi: At 11 AM on a Monday morning to took over 30 minutes to travel from the Hotel 1898 (on Las Ramblas) to the CF. I could have walked to the CF in just over half that time if I didn鈥檛 have a large suitcase with me.I would also like to try the Hotel Majestic, which is only 2 or 3 blocks from the CF and so many Trip Advisor members have spoken so highly of it. But I wouldn鈥檛 think twice about staying at the CF again. I cannot fault the experience 鈥?well maybe the 5 pound room key system REALLY does need to be done away with in favor of a keycard 鈥?but otherwise it was truly wonderful. I never made it to breakfastas I had saved that for my checkout day but ended up having to check out at 4:30 AM due to a last minute change in my travel plans. The reviews on TA are a little bit misleading for the CF. I noticed a lot of people gave the CF 4-out-of-5 while nearly all the reviews of the 1998 are 5-out-of-5. These reviews, coupled with the uber-cheap rate I was originally given for the CF, made me originally want to avoid it. Too often have I stayed at a 鈥済reat鈥?hotel at a steep discount and regretted doing so. I was seriously afraid that the CF was past its prime. Thankfully the CF was everything I expected 鈥?actually better b/c it surpassed the 1898 鈥?truly a tough act to follow 鈥?in so many ways. But I would explain the stellar reviews that the 1898 gets by saying that it probably exceeds people鈥檚 expectations as a 4 star hotel while it sounds like the CF sometimes does not live up to people鈥檚 expectations. I would say that the CF met my expectations in every way and exceeded them in certain ways as well. The 1898 may be a better value because it is much, much more affordably priced while offering many similar amenities and services. But there really is no comparison. These hotels have a different vibe 鈥?that of the CF is decidedly more up-market. Of course most of the tourists in both hotels were Americans and the dollar is just not what it used to be. I believe people are judging by 鈥渂ang for the buck鈥?鈥?as Euro 300 is now worth closer to $450 while it once was as little as $240.. a whopping 87% increase in 6 years. That is no small consideration.The CF is amongst the best in Barcelona. I hope to eventually stay at the Majestic and may find myself at the Hotel Arts at some point, which I visited for lunch one day and felt like I was in Battery Park City, NYC 鈥?totally cut off from the rest of the city. And what鈥檚 up with the lack of a restaurant on a high floor? How could they forget to utilize the best amenity they have, and charge dearly for: the stellar views! It must be reserved for hotel guests (no less than one nights stay is the cost of admission to what is probably one of the most spectacular vistas in the Mediterranean). And they probably want to avoid the afternoon tea phenomenon 鈥?not that I blame them. In the meantime, the Casa Fuster will be for me the best place to sty in Barcelona. Hopefully it wont take me 10 years to go back to BCN like it did this time.

<Content>Very nice but expensive Great location a short walk from main attractions and shops. Casa Fuster is beautifully decorated and furnished in natural tones. Room quality is better than we would expect in major city hotels. However at nearly 300 Euros a night it is a bit pricey.

<Content>Great stay - wonderful staff We stayed at Hotel Casa Fuster in Barcelona for four nights in September 2007 and we're very pleased with the hotel. While not inexpensive, the quality of this hotel definitely lived up to the price. The rooms were typically European in that they weren't overly large, but were extremely well equipped with many amenities, large bathroom, etc. We also had a great experience with the hotel staff. They were extremely helpful in tracking down and retrieving a piece of lost luggage for us - we had an update every time we walked past the front desk without even asking - and they recommended several great restaurants in the area. Overall, a great stay.

<Content>Very nice hotel Proberly not quite a 5 star hotel but definately a 4 star it has a great location, well within walking distance to plenty of shops and places of intrest and only a 5/10 min bus ride to the beach, the hotel itself had nice sized rooms the decor very plush and the staff were extremely helpful and very friendly, we avoided the breakfast as it was very expensive but there is a nice coffee bar close by.

<Content>Leading Hotel not recommended for Leaders Club members (and those who are not) I stayed at Hotel Casa Fuster for one night on September 17th, 2007. As a Leaders Club Access member I booked a standard room via Leading Hotels (269,64 Euro tax included, without breakfast). At time of booking it was the most expensive Leading Hotel of all four Leading Hotels in Barcelona for that night.I arrived at 1.30pm. One doorman and two bellboys were on duty but talking with each other. I had to carry the luggage about 10m from the street to the hotel entrance on my own (at the entrance a bellboy asked for help). At reception there was no room available, so I did eat a club sandwich in the meantime. One hour later room 520 was ready, I got the key at reception but no guidance to the room. The room was one of the smallest I stayed for a long time, the last on the corridor at the backside of the hotel with no sights. According to the floor plan the room was one of the smallest on the fifth floor. Beside of the definetely not given room upgrade there was no welcome card, no welcome gift or fruits in the room, what is unusual for Leaders Club members.The key fob was very big and heavy (400g?) and one had to unlock the electricity system. with this key. Very annoying: the air condition stops working when you leave and you return into a heated room (32 degrees Celsius that day!). The in the directory mentioned remote controlled lighting wasn麓t available and not necessary because you nearly could reache everything in the room without leaving the bed. There also were two small cupboard of maybe 40cm and a maximum length of one meter, no chance to hang trousers or to store a bit mor than three suits. The plastic hangers were fixed like in four star hotels. Beside two notepads there was no paper or envelopes available and any clock was missing, too (not even in the TV or telephone display). The bathroom was of good size, but without seperate shower stall what is unusual for newer Leading Hotels.When the bellboy with the luggage arrived I complained about the misssing clock (I don麓t have one on my own and forgot my mobile phone), the small room and asked if there are no welcome amenities which are part of the Leaders Club programm. 20 minutes later a bottle of Cava with choclates was brought to the room (without any card but verv nice arranged) the clock was announced to be delivered. After five hours I asked for the clock. The new receptionist didn麓t know about this request and told me that they could buy one for me by charging the costs to my room! Finally they delivered an alarm clock free of charge.Turn down was done correctly with a free bottle of mineral water, shoe shine wasn麓t done overnight, a paper was not given in the morning either.A concierge is missing. All request have to be made at reception which makes you feel uncomfortable because other guests have to wait when they want to check in or to collect the room keys (due to the size and weight most guest leave the keys at reception).All in all not a dramatic stay but not what you normally expect when staying at a Leading Hotel (...luxury sets them apart - Leading Hotels brings them together). Everything but the rate was mediocre and cannot satisfy guests who often stay in upscaled properties - and pay 400 USD a year for a Leaders Club Access Membership with lots of promissed advantages. So I rate this hotel with two Tripadvisor-stars: Okay, but some problems.

<Content>classy hotel Classy hotel, in a classy part of barcelona, near to all the sights, a bit of a walk to las ramblas so a bit further away from the party scene. very helpful staff, rooms very tastefully decorated with nice bathrooms. turn down service and a pillow menu! some of the rooms do differ considerably in size though, maybe ask for a larger room,,also the rooftop pool is only really aplunge pool but the rooftop is lovley to sit out and have a few relaxing drinks.breakfast very expensive!

<Content>Excellent Hotel Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of August. Hotel is well situated about 3 minutes walk from Diagonal metro station. Staff are very helpful and pleasant. Room was slightly small but well appointed and immaculate. The roof top terrace has superb views over the city and there is a small fitness suite and a pool. We had the buffet breakfast which was superb. I would highly recomend this hotel.

<Content>Fab!!! What can I say! This hotel is absolutely fabulous! Being a Travel Agent I have stayed at some luxurious hotels all over the world, but this has got to be up there with some of the best!The rooms the staff are all what you expect of a 5 Star Hotel and more.A special note has to be said for Antonio the doorman. His professional and friendly nature is a credit to the Casa Fuster.Stay here if you can it's well worth the money.

<Content>If Barcelona鈥檚 your thing then you鈥檒l love this hotel This property is spectacular when viewed from the outside and the interior is just as special. The bar and lounge areas have to be seen to be believed with huge marble columns and fabulous Art Deco furnishings. The service is excellent with friendly and polite staff that were always on hand to offer advice on getting the best out of your stay in Barcelona. The food was great and they do some wonderful cocktails鈥ry the Casa Fuster Bellini鈥ow! The interior of our hotel room was a visual delight and the bathroom was one of the best I鈥檝e ever seen with wall-to-wall marble and first class fixtures and fittings. The only negative point is that our room was rather small and so it felt a little claustrophobic at times. Although I didn鈥檛 care much for Barcelona - perhaps it was the non-stop rain we had - it was nice to leave all the traffic and pedestrian pandemonium outside when you stepped into this wonderful hotel. If Barcelona鈥檚 your thing then you鈥檒l love staying here.

<Content>Very enjoyable at Casa Fuster I was a little concerned upon checking in because I heard a guest complaining about something or other, but all in all we were well taken care of and given a room to our liking. We had to see a few rooms before deciding on one we liked best. My wife and I want to be as comfortable as possible when we travel, so it's not uncommon for us to look at several rooms before deciding on one. I'm sure we drive the staff bonkers, but I wanna be comfy! Sometimes it's a cleanliness issue, sometimes it's a wear and tear issue. At Casa F I'd call it a wear and tear issue. The hotel has only been open two or three years, but hotel years are like dog years. Sadly guests don't treat hotels the same way they treat their own homes...at least that's what my presumption is. Perhaps I'm wrong. In any event, the hotel is quite comfortable and in a nice area that is quiet and appeared to be quite safe. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast is incredible. I'm not one to eat breakfast, but at Casa Fuster, bring it on. They have the most delicious breakfast buffet, I dream about it. For someone who really doesn't enjoy eating, I absolutely loved the breakfast there. My wife has stayed there a couple of other times while traveling and has noticed a bit of wear and tear, but again that's the nature of the beast. During her first stay, the hotel was only open for about two weeks. As noted above, a couple or three years has shown itself. Nevertheless, I enjoy the hotel and can vouch for the staff by saying that if an issue arises and you're not happy with something, they do whatever they can to accommodate you.

<Content>Lovely staff, pretty building, but rock hard beds. The Casa Fuster is architecturally stunning, though the black floors and artful lighting give a bit of a cave-like feel. Every staff member was lovely and kind and warm. The bed rooms were modern and pretty and very clean, though I wished for more light. Unfortunately the beds are rock hard and there was street noise. After a couple of nights of tossing and turning, we moved out, forfeiting our pre-paid rooms (ouch). We were there with our children who stayed in their own room, and their experience was like ours. They were unable to sleep because of the hard beds and street noise.
