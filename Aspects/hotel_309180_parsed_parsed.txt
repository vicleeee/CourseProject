<Content>Great stay Stayed at the Staybridge Suites 31st Oct to 8th Nov with my husband. Check in was handled well and we got the rate we were given on booking. We had a studio room on the 4th floor near the lifts but it was quiet enough. Room was large with 2 queen beds a kitchen area with fridge freezer (had auromatic ice maker), microwave, a couple of electic rings and a coffee machine. More than satisfied with the room and fittings. Breakfast buffet was good, sundowner with beer and wine Tues - Thurs was an added bonus. Good location minutes walk from Canal street and Harrah's Casino. Handy for streetcars too. All in all an enjoyable stay, no complaints.

<Content>Good place to stay for work This is a hotel with small apartments -- studio, 1 or 2 bedrooms. The Studios can, my colleague, said be noisy because of noise from the hallways but my bedroom was very quiet, very comfortable and had lots of space. The kitchen was adequate and th working desk was good.The staff were great -- the General Manager offered to help carry my bags up to the room Lovely people who are clearly very committed.The one let down is the Internet access. Whether wired or wireless, it is slow and temperamental

<Content>customer service in need of help The rates at the Staybridge New Orleans was great. Unfortunately, they did not inform anyone there is a twenty-six dollar a night parking fee. This is not indicated online or when speaking to the hotel. I was shocked and realized it was not an oversight -several others checked in with me and was not pleased as well. The suites were roomy but in need of repairs. The notification of repairs did not appear to be an important issue. Each notification (there were several) took several hours to be addressed. I did like the location of the hotel, but will probably not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Fairly Solid, No Frills, Business Hotel.... I am currently at the four week mark of an eight week stay at the Staybridge Inn New Orleans. To date my stay has been pleasant, while not exceptional for a fairly standard business class hotel. I have a king suite which is average to slightly above in size to that of comparable hotels. I have been pleased with the full breakfast served each morning as well as the Sundowner dinners served Tues. - Thurs. My only real complaint with this property would be with the housekeeping staff. After four weeks I'm still trying to figure out the cleaning schedule, and to be completely honest, I'm not wholly convinced there is one. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't classify this hotel as dirty. However the cleaning staff puts forth minimal effort at best. I actually had to leave a note in my room at one point that read Please Vacumn. To top this off, one Sunday afternoon I happened to be in my room when the staff came through and the young lady actually stepped into my room and asked for a tip! Other than the previously stated issues I've been otherwise pleased with my stay here at the Staybridge. The location in great, within easy walking distance of all of New Orleans top attractions without the noise and raucousness of the French Quarter and Bourbon Street. I would recommend this hotel and will probably stay here again on return trips. Last thing I should note, this property has absolutely NO PARKING, so if you're driving plan on at least an additional $25.00 per day in your cost analysis.

<Content>A Reasonable Place to Stay.... I spent five nights at this hotel. My top priorities are a quiet room and a smoke-free room. For the most part, the hotel was quiet. The rooms are suites, which are generally quieter than standard rooms with connecting doors to the next guest's room. My only complaint on the quiet front was the doors from hallway into the rooms. They SLAM! They also do not block sounds from the hallway, so if anybody is talking within 75 feet of your door, you will hear the entire conversation. As for smoke-free, the first room I was assigned smelled very much like the nearby casino. It reeked. The second room had just a hint of old tobacco, but it was tolerable and I didn't want to risk trying a third room after my experience with the first room! One of the housekeepers told me the lower floors are more smoke free than the upper, and it is true that my second room was on a lower floor than my first.A couple of small hassles -- washrags were scarce. I didn't see one until my 4th day! Also, the scrambled eggs at the complimentary breakfast were consistently the worst I've ever eaten, which is ironic because the rest of the breakfast was decent, especially considering that most of the hotels in the area do not provide free breakfast. In fact, during the week, the hotel also provides a small supper meal, complete with free drinks, for those who may not have time or funds to eat in style every evening. Other plusses at the hotel were a fine business center with free printing, free internet throughout the hotel, a congenial desk staff, and a location convenient to the waterfront, the French Quarter, the Convention Center, the Casino, and the Aquarium.

<Content>Nice stay at the Staybridge! My wife and I stayed here recently for the BCS National Championship Game and we were very satisfied. We were the first people to stay in our one bedroom suite in the newly renovated warehouse building next to the main hotel. The suite was beautiful w/ engineered hardwood floors, granite counter tops in the kitchen and stainless steel appliances (including washer and dryer). The breakfast buffet hit the spot each morning and the food quality was average/typical. The location was ideal and quiet as the hotel is located close to the French Quarter but far enough away to allow for a good (quiet) night of sleep. We will definitely return to the Staybridge if our travels ever take us to New Orleans again!

<Content>Mostly good The Staybridge is located at the foot of the central business district, close to Harrah's, the river, the Rivercenter Mall, steamboats, about 5 or 6 blocks west of the French Quarter. Its not a four diamond, or even three, but it met our needs well. We had a two br suite which had a very large open area for a living or common room. Each br had two double beds with a small bath, no separate shower, and a single sink/vanity outside the bath. The bath has the extended curved shower curtain rail. There is a small kithchenette in the common room with a FULL sized fridge, toaster, microwave, dishwasher, no stove. Plates, silverware, lots of juice, regular drink glasses, wine glasses, pots and pans, kitchenware. Plenty of drawer space in chests both in the bedrooms and the common room. Three flat screen tvs, one in each br and one in the common area in an armoire. But, the d/w didn't work and door handles were off two of the four french doors leading to the bedrooms. One smoke alarm missing its cover and batteries. Taken by previous guest? Also limited housekeeping and towel service. Excellent breakfast, huge container of scrambled eggs, sausage good fruit selection, waffle maker, breads, yogurt, lots of options. Downtown New Orleans has street people. Lots of street people. Supposedly 3000 before Katrina, supposedly 6000 now. If you go north up Canal as far as IH-10, maybe a mile from the CBD, there is a tent city under overpasses there with hundreds of them. Two of the four days we were there a guy snuck in to the breakfast and I saw management removing another with a cup of their coffee in his hand while we were waiting checking out. Just be alert. Besides the breakfast seating area there is a decent sitting area in the foyer and a nice hd tv with four home theatre chairs between the foyer and the breakfast area. We found this to be a good central location for what we wanted to do. Its equidistant from the Quarter and the great WW II museum, a must see. Its also close enough to the three street car lines, riverfront, Canal and St. Charles. The St. Charles line is now completely open, we went all the way out to the end beyond Loyola and back. Staff was courteous and helpful. We would stay here again.

<Content>Great Place, Great Price, Great Service... Bad Parking Great Place. Hotel is super nice and clean, they provided a full breakfast with eggs, sausage, cereal, muffins, pancakes, fixins, etc. They also had a sundown reception when we were there with a mexican style buffet that was really nice (free beer, yay!). Room was really big with a couch and kitchen fully stocked with cooking utensils. They even have free laundry on site (although some of the machines were not working). Staff was super friendly and accomodating. We had a wonderful view of downtown and the river from our room on the top floor. Everywhere you want to go is within walking distance... The walk to the French Quarter is really short. Area is safe. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit New Orleans.

<Content>Great location but that is it. This hotel is in a good location, just a short walk from the French Quarter. However that is about the best thing going for it. I had asked when we booked the hotel 4 months prior to arrival for adjoining rooms or 2 rooms very close by as we are a big family. I asked again a few days before arrival. The rooms given to us were 4 floors apart! We asked for something closer but were told that we could spend the second night in a suite for all of us, but we declined as I did not want to pack up again. Then one of my kids got a pillow for another kid from the closet so they could sit and watch ESPN. My son smelled onions (!) and turned the pillow over, there was a lump which when we looked in the pillowcase was a half eaten dried out sub! So gross. Obviously no one had changed the pillowcase or the sub would have fallen out. I asked that the linens be changed because I was so disgusted, and they at least did that. I do not think the level of cleanliness or service is up to par, even for a moderate hotel. Will definitely not go back.

<Content>Great bargain, great for families with kids My family and I stayed here for one night, on August 1, 2007. I booked the hotel thru their website, mainly because of its location. We wanted to be close to the Aquarium and the Riverwalk.Here is our review of pro's and con's with this hotelPro's* Great location* Sundown reception- Awesome. The night we were there they had hamburgers and hot dogs, perfect for us since we had our 3 kids with us. They also offered wine and beer, all free of charge.* Breakfast also included in your rate.* Appliances in all the suites. We had a full size refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, toaster, coffee maker and a small (2 burner) range.* We had a studio with 2 double beds and a pull out couch, it was big enough for all of us.* Ironing board/iron/hair dryer all in the room* Room was clean (except for the towel- see below)* Goody bag upon check in, which included a handy map of the city.Con's*No vallet parking. We parked across the street, for about $25/day. *There was no one to help with the bags, which was quite challenging when you are dealing with 3 small kids plus bags.* Signs of wear on the carpet, definitely needs replacing.* A dirty towel still hanging in the bathroom. We called and asked for clean towels, since we weren't sure about the ones who were in the room. Not a problem.There is a pool at the hotel, just 5 ft deep. It's on a courtyard, so the water was very cold. Not a bad thing on a hot summer day, unless you want a big pool.Overall we had a great stay and will stay at this hotel on our next trip to New Orleans.

<Content>Like home with new friends!!! This is the hotel you want to stay in if you want to be right in the center of things but want to pay a little less! Staybridge was absolutely excellent! Its right across from The W, a block from Harrahs, a 5 minute walk to the convention center, and across the street from the World Famous Mothers Restaurant.I went during a festival weekend and the staff and management were excellent. Because they were booked to capacity, both the Operations Manager and General manager were on site 24 hours to make sure the guests were taken care of. There was a hot breakfast and plenty of space in the rooms with modern amenities.People I know who stayed at the W wish they stayed there because it was cheaper, with more space, breakfast, and modern. This is New Orleans Best kept secret!

<Content>Great hotel with a lot of room. We stayed here over the weekend, and were very pleased with the hotel! Only complaints were temporary glitches - nothing for most people to worry about.The suites are all good sized, although if you were living in one for several weeks, I'm sure the walls would close in. I used Priority Club points, so our room was one of the smaller ones, and it was big for a room. Nice firm king sized bed, bathroom was nice, kitchen compact but fine for one or two people - don't try to cook a four course meal there! All the plates, glasses, pans,  stuff were there. Convenience store in the lobby had food stuff - not a lot of fresh foods, but things for someone to cook an easy meal.Breakfast in the morning was included and better than most - not just muffins and hard boiled eggs like some, but actually scrambled eggs and sausage too. Not quite a luxury full-serve breakfast buffet, but much better than I was anticipating.Service was also good. Upon check-in we got a small goodie bag with water, chips, candy bar, etc... front desk called up to make sure everything was ok, too. We told him that toilet was making an odd noise when flushed, so they sent someone up right away that night and he fixed it.Air conditioning was weak, but that was unusual. A major thunderstorm came through that day, and the building was struck by lightning, blowing fuses and burning out air conditioning motors. They pieced the system back together the best they could for the weekend, and it was scheduled for major repairs on Monday.Location is good - on Poydras just a couple of blocks from Canal and from Harrah's. Easy walking distance to either, and 10-15 minutes from Quarter.Parking was one of the few problems, but apparently there's a plan to fix that too. Currently, the only parking the hotel currently has adjacent to the building is an alley next door to the hotel, but the entire parking has been purchased for 6 months by a single company with many employees at the hotel long term. Apparently there are 3 months or so left to go on this arrangement, so don't be surprised in the mean time. Parking alternatives include a surface lot 2 blocks away for $30/day or Harrah's for $20/day. If you play for 30 minutes at Harrah's, though, parking is free. The hotel has purchased the building next door so they can add two floors of parking and new, larger rooms, so the problem should be fixed at some point in the future.Pool was squeezed into a tight space, but I'm sure that kids won't mind. It's not a place to lay out and work on your tan, or to see and be seen.This is a hotel I would not hesitate to recommend, and I would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Very pleasant stay! We just returned from Jazz Fest and enjoyed our stay at the Staybridge Suites! Major strengths:* Best hotel BED I have ever stayed in - much more comfortable than what we have at home* Modern conveniences easily accessable such as FREE access to PC's, printers, etc.* Full FREE continental breakfasts including fresh belgian waffles, etc.* Very spacious rooms that could easily accommodate two couples or large families* Clean accommodations* Kitchen in room* Great location (right across the street from Harrah's and Mother's)What Staybridge Suites lacks in the French New Orleans decor/style shown in other hotels, it surely makes up for it in all other areas.

<Content>The only place we will stay We Pricelined this hotel for $100 a night for the saturday before Mardi Gras. We got there and were told our room was ready at 11am. I called ahead and was told the crews stayed here alot and parking may be tough, so we parked at the airport and took a shuttle in. We were only supposed to be here one night but since it was nice we decided to add another night and cancel our room on Bourbon. Since we didn't have a reservation I figured our price would go up but it didn't. The room was vey spacious and right on the parade route. Very convenient. There were quite a few families here. We didn't bring our kids but are planning on it next year and this is definitely where we will stay. It has plenty of room and a full kitchen. The area is safe and just a few blocks from Bourbon and the Riverwalk. The staff were outstanding and obviously overworked but great. I can't say enough about the hotel staff and the room. It was clean, nice and vry functional. We love upper scale hotels but cancelled ours to stay where the people were nice and the room was ready.

<Content>Staybridge was wonderful! A friend and I stayed during Mardi Gras and were VERY pleased. I am from Louisiana and have stayed in many New Orleans hotels during Mardi Gras. This was such a deal ... we paid over $100 less than all other available hotels were charging. The location is very convenient, the room was very nice (HUGE, full-size fridge/freezer in the kitchen, nice bathroom, great view), and the staff was polite and helpful throughout our stay. I'm planning on booking again for Jazz Fest!

<Content>Nice Hotel This hotel is very clean, including the rooms. Friendly staff. Nice free breakfast. Free meals 3 evenings a week. Free washer/dryer on 3 floors. You'll only get your sheets changed once every 3 days unless you request otherwise.One of the curtains on the (9ft.) windows came off it's track and my request to have it fixed was ignored. I wouldn't have cared except for the fact that the morning light woke me up way too early. Anyway, we stood on a table and fixed it ourselves. I couldn't get cold water out of any of the 3 faucets in the suite. Only lukewarm, no matter how long I let it run. Luckily, we had a fridge and kept a jug of water in there. Their water-saver showerheads are way beyond ridiculous. I was in the shower twice as long as I normally am due to lack of water pressure, so I don't see how they think they're conserving anything. Airport shuttle is $27.00. I would stay here again. Within a few blocks of the French Quarter and the AP. Quality hotel. A block from Harrah's. Our suite was right across the street from Mother's. We never ate there, but it was interesting watching the very long lines of people waiting to get in there several times a day.

<Content>Wonderful choice for this family's 1st trip to New Orleans!! I must say that this was the Best choice in hotels we could have made. We chose this hotel based on trip advisor views and boy were we impressed! Staybridge offered everything we expected plus much more. The staff was friendly and welcoming from the time we first walked through the doors and until the last minute by offering to book our swamp tour for us and even holding our luggage for us after we checked out. (Oh, one little tip, save yourself alot of money and don't go on a swamp tour in March or April, it is still to cool for the gators. All we saw were snakes and swampland. Our boys were disappointed!) We requested an upper level room and they gave us the 16th floor which our boys loved, we slept with the curtains open with a great view of the city @ night. Breakfast and evening snacks were an added bonus. They even offer light meals in the evening which we never had time to take advantage of due to spending every minute we had exploring NO. All in all this was a great stay especially for a family. VERY reasonably priced, clean and as close as you can get to FQ without being in it. We loved our stay and if we return this is definitly where we will stay!!

<Content>Great Staybridge was great, clean rooms, and good services. Not far from FQ 5-6 blocks. You should be aware that NO is tourist town and everything is overprice so bring money.Also there is no free parking to be found. We ate all local spots Mothers, Mulate鈥檚. We had poor service, but the was food great. I really don鈥檛 know what鈥檚 the big deal about Mother鈥檚. I though the sandwiches were ok, nothing more. NO is a fun town and I would go back. Just remember to bring lots of money!

<Content>Great place to stay! We were in town for a convention and the Staybridge was a great place. It is directly between the Convention Center and the French Quarter so you can walk to everything. The staff was very pleasant and friendly. They serve breakfast everyday, dinner's on Tuesday thru Friday (included with your stay), along with complimenatery beer and wine. We booked thru Harrah's Casino and got a better deal on the room's thru them. The rooms are very clean and having your own kitchen with refrigerator was nice also. If I go back, this is where I am going to stay.

<Content>Clean, convenient but no sofa bed We wanted to stay near but not in the French Quarter with our children, 5 and 2, and really wanted to have a suite so the children could sleep in a separate room. Fortunately, the 5 year old didn't mind sleeping on the sofa and liked the (quite small) hotel pool and the afternoon popcorn. Staff varied from lovely to not very helpful. Breakfast was convenient. For the price, it was probably a good deal, especially if you are travelling with very young children.

<Content>Not the right room, charged twice My husband, self, and friend went to New Orleans this February after a cruise stay. We had a one bedroom suite that was supposed to have a sleeper sofa. It didn't. They did nothing to correct this. Also, we complained three times of the sewer gas coming from our bathroom and nothing was done. Evening staff were very friendly but unable to help us. Also, I prepaid and was charged for the room twice and charged for an extra day. They reversed the second stay charges but I have not received the money back for the additional day. It's a shame, because the food they put out in the morning was good, and they had good potential based on the other reviews.

<Content>Fabulous! My 6th trip to this fantastic city, We stayed here during Mardi Gras this year and it was a great. Book early for a great price. Within walking distance to the quarter and the riverfront. Also a short walk to the street car on St. Charles. Staff was very friendly. It is a very nice, clean hotel. Free internet, breakfast, and light dinner certain weeknights. All rooms have a kitchen which was key. I will definately be staying here from now on when I come to New Orleans. See you in '06!

<Content>Great Hotel We were booked at another hotel on New Year's Eve. They overbooked and send us to this hotel. It was the best move. We loved the room. Never had a hotel with a dishwasher. The hotel room were spacious. The hotel offered complimentary breakfast. The front desk was so nice to us. We felt safe and comfortable walking around even if we did not get in until 3 a.m. Great hotel

<Content>such a deal! My husband and I (in our late 30s) stayed at the Staybridge Suites during Halloween and we loved it. The hotel is a five minute walk from the French Quarter. I would not recommend staying in the French Quarter during a rowdy holiday or special event (unless drunks and drama are your thing of course). There is a good complimentary breakfast available to guests (scrambled eggs, cereal, muffins and bagels, fruit, juice, coffee, the whole shebang). The room was comfortable and the A/C was working great. Our room was incredibly quiet. You can catch the St. Charles streetcar nearby (about a 2 minute walk). The hotel is located on a nice safe street (pronouced chop-i-toulis) and there is a big parking lot (not affiliated with the hotel) across the street (not cheap though). All the staff we dealt with were top notch.

<Content>Staybridge Great Location and More We stayed at the Staybridge Suites in July and enjoyed it very much. Huge double room w/ parlor for 3 of us. Great breakfasts every day and Tues - Thurs nice free snack (hot dogs, chicken nuggets, hamburgers). We could walk to just about everthing we wanted to see. There was one problem with the telephone -- it kept showing a messsage, but there wasn't one -- took days for the front desk to respond to it. Would definately stay there again.
