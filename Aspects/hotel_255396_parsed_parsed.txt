<Content>Fantastic location Booked this hotel after reading reviews on this website. Stayed for 3 nights with our toddler.Simply fantastic location. A very very short walk to Darling Harbour - a great location as a base to see the major sites of Sydney. We generally ate in the restaurants around the Harbour so didn't eat in the hotel. No view from the room but we didn't care - we were out having fun.Very clean hotel - pretty much what you'd expect + hope from one of the major chains, no noticeable traffic or noise from the other rooms. Friendly and efficient staff (travel cot included without charge). Couldn't ask for more!

<Content>Look Elsewhere! Many better options We first stayed in Sydney at the start of our visit to Australia at the Rendezvous Hotel, in the historic district and thoroughly enjoyed it. Great location, clean, bright, well appointed rooms. We thought when we returned for a night prior to our flight out, we'd try another hotel, so we booked one night at the Holiday Inn Darling Harbour. What a disappointment across the board! Even my kids were depressed by the state of this hotel, with its dark, dingy hallways. The supposed workout room and hot tub was enough to make you feel ill just walking into it, which you had to do through the filthy laundry room. The rooms themselves are well appointed, though the funky light system using the key card was annoying. However, the windows allow little or no light and the schlept through the odd lobby, hotel and hallways made it sad experience. Had we been planning to stay more than one night, we would have definitely changed hotels. The key card for everything made us feel like we were in a lock down facility and that the neighborhood was really questionable. Pay the extra money and stay in The Rocks area.

<Content>Satisfiying Stay I recently spent 3 nights at the Darling Harbour Holiday Inn and my experience was quite good. After a long 15 flight from San Francisco I was able to check in at 9:30 in the morning giving me time too freshen up and get in a full day of sight seeing. The rooms are on the smallish side, but this is the norm for a big city property. The rooms was very clean, quiet and as others have said the location is wonderful. There are plenty of places to eat nearby and attractions are also very accessible. I have no problem recommending this hotel.

<Content>Clean hotel in a great location The most useful feature of this hotel is its central location. It's less than a 5 minute walk to great eateries in Chinatown, Paddy's market and the Monorail station. Through Monorail, Darling Harbour and Sydney CBD are easily accessible. Note that Circular Quay / Harbour Bridge / Opera House still require either a 15 minute walk or 5 minute cab ride ($10) after using the Monorail. The monorail goes right next to the hotel so the lower floors (2-3) might not get that much privacy.The hotel is clean and has all the basic amenities. Internet comes at a pretty hefty price though. There are no detailed phone tariffs posted in the rooms (this seems to be the norm in Australia) and the front desk receptionist was pretty hazy when I called up (local calls are a dollar I think, toll free should be free except for some numbers blah blah)....I was keeping my fingers crossed till I checked out........it turned out not so bad in the end (toll free calls were free; local calls were 1 dollar per call)

<Content>Good location This is a great location but don't expect a great view from your room.The staff was pleasant but small.The mattress was very firm. It is right next to the market area which has a great place to exchange currency for no fee. It is also a good place to pick up a low priced breakfast or lunch. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Acceptable A convenient location on the Chinatown side of Darling Harbour, particularly if need to be in the area.Check-in was average. I stood at the demarcated location for Priority Club members, and was asked by a somewhat irritated reception staff whether I was a member and I replied in an equally irritated and sarcastic manner which resulted in a change of attitude.I was in the new part of the hotel, and the room layout is a bit strange - its very narrow and long with the bed stretching across the width of the room. A peculiar layout and not the best use of space. Otherwise room was fine, clean with all necessary essentials.Around a 10-15 minute walk will take you into the heart of the Darling Harbour action. The same amount of time will take you into the heart of the city. A monorail station is close by, Paddy's Market is across the road, and a range of eating options are close by, since you are in Chinatown.Not the best value for money as such, but acceptable.

<Content>Excellent Location What an excellent hotel in a great location! This is a holiday inn though so don't expect the sheraton, however...This hotel is in a perfect location for a visit to Sydney. Located in china town, a 1 minute walk to Paddys market and a 1.5 minute walk to a monorail station. Easy walk and access to Darling Harbour.If you want to go to Cricular Quay it is a bit tricky, but pretty much you just catch a bus straight down george street. Or alternatively, walk to Central and catch a train from there.Fantastic restaurant on Golbourn street, Mamak. Satay and Roti restauant. Cheap and the best satays I have had outside Malaysia. An absolute definite must eat here restaurant, and cheap too!As for the hotel itself. We stayed in an executive room on the 10th floor and for 2 adults and 2 kids it was pretty good value. The kids loved the foxtel! The rooms are a good size and the bathroom is great with a seperate bath and shower. They need to look at adding a micowave into the kitcheny area they have as this would add to the room. We had a room facing George street and the view was pretty non existent.Also be aware this property does not have a pool. It does have a hot tub/spa, but it is a 6 person residential type, and not really pratical for a hotel of this size.I would give this hotel a 7/10 and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Average Sydney hotel The hotel is sandwiched between Chinatown and the Entertainment Centre, which is quite convenient but means you won't get much of a view, at least not from the lower floors. The rooms are reasonably comfortable - not large, but I have seen much smaller in Sydney. Windows do not open, so it can get a little stuffy in the room. The gym is tiny, and the whirlpool (which seats just 4 people) would not operate when we tried it. Breakfast had quite a wide range including a self-serve juice bar, but was missing a few of my favourites e.g. toasted muesli, cream, and plain, gelatine-free yogurt. For tea and coffee, you have to catch the attention of the staff, but they do serve it hot. All the hotel staff were friendly and efficient. Overall it is a reasonable city hotel, but neither especially exciting nor a stand-out bargain.

<Content>This hotel is in the neutral zone. Upgraded room due to my mileage status.Nicely appointed room except the bed was too close to the wall on the side where the alarm clock/phone was on, so had to climb over the bed to get to the clock. (ie Odd placement of bed, may be due to lack of space or too big a bed for the room size?) That's all good however...I guess rooms are a little tighter since you are smack in Sydney. To get to the room I had to go up a mini-stairs (about 5 steps) after getting off the elevator, which has inconvenient when considering the weight of my suitcase.Location is excellent if you like China Towns. It is right there. It has a nice restaurants downstairs in the hotel, but go out to China Town. Just follow the smell of food and you won't go wrong.The staff was efficient. Not quite as friendly as ones I encountered in Brisbane or Adelaide however, but efficient. Concierge when asked about a good place to eat, pointed me to the Holiday Inn restaurants on the first floor when China Town is only a block away. He should have at least asked me what kind of food I liked or something.I hold this hotel in the neutral zone.

<Content>Great Location This was somewhat of an odd hotel. Staff was friendly and helpful. However, the hotel had quirks. When you turn off the lights at the front door, it kills the lights for the bathroom. Basically you had to turn the lights on in the entire room to go to the bathroom. No late night trips to the bathroom or you wake up everyone. In addition, there were only two lights, quite dark. The room overlooked the monorail, which was interesting, but quiet. The kids enjoyed waving at people when they rode by. The handicap bath was nice and functional, but two towels for four people no matter how nice you were. We also booked three rooms directly through Holiday Inn, which created a problem. There were apparently no double beds for accessible rooms as Holiday Inn stated. This was the reason for staying at the location. Wheel chair accessible means only five steps to your room. This was resolved only after I agreed to pay for a rollaway bed. After 35 hours of travel, you just accept defeat and live with the charge. The location is outstanding. Near Darling Harbor, Chinatown, 10 minute walk to quality shopping. The location and support staff makes the hotel tolerable.

<Content>Decent hotel, kind of strange location We stayed at the Holiday Inn Darling Harbour for one night, the last night of our honeymoon in Australia. We got to the hotel at about 11:30PM after an evening flight from Cairns and checked out about 5AM to catch our flight home, so we were not at the hotel very long at all.The hotel seemed fine - our room was clean and comfortable. We had a room on the first floor, which had a strange layout - bathroom and closet just inside the door, then about 4 steps town to a sunken bedroom area just big enough for the queen size bed. But furnishings were decent and everything worked OK.The area around the hotel is really Chinatown more than Darling Harbour. There are mostly chinese restaurants in the area adjacent to the hotel, but we found a diner-style place that was still open at midnight to get some food before bed.The hotel suggested we take the airport shuttle instead of a taxi - the shuttle picks up from the hotel every half-hour starting at 5AM. This was a fairly quick way to the airport and it was cheaper than a taxi, only about $10 AUD per person.

<Content>Poor "Front Desk" Service Whilst this hotel is in a good location - within walking distance to Darling Harbour the Front Desk service that I experienced when checking in was extremely poor. A queen bed room was booked but could not be offered to me as they did not have any of these rooms left. When I asked could housekeeping please come up and make the twin beds into a double for us, she rudely said that this could not be done due to the hotel rules, but if I wanted to make it up myself I could - this meant moving side tables, beds and requesting new sheets / doonas etc. - Not a great way to have to start your stay!When we then enquired about car-parking the same lady on reception was once again very rude to us and could not even tell us where we should park - we had to go and locate the concierge ourselves to find this out.The hotel itself is of standard quality, but beginning to show the signs of a needed upgrade.

<Content>Very satisfied After reading other reviews before staying at The HI, I was a little concerned. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The people at The HI were extremely pleasant and helpful. The rooms were clean and neat. We faced Chinatown. The view in our room wasn't the best. It was a brick wall and the roof of another building. I didn't mind though because we really didn't spend a whole lot of time in the room and when we did, it was only to sleep. The breakfast buffet was very good but was basically the same all the time. Know that you can ask for your eggs cooked to your liking. Transportation of all kinds were close. However, I wish I had done some research before hand on how to use it. The tram was easy to use but only went in a circle and made stops up to Cockle Bay and back. If you're going to take the bus, know how they run. Make sure you know the bus #'s and where they go and how to get back. The conceirge was very helpful for that. If you like to walk, there's a lot in walking distance. Especially Paddy's Market. Good shopping!!! Expect to spend hours there. Overall I had a great experience.

<Content>Decent hotel The hotel is located on the back of Chinatown in Sydney across from the convention center. Even though the monorail runs right outside the hotel, we barely heard any noise. The room was not that big but it was fine for us. The beds were all right too. The location is about a 30 minutes walk to Circular Quay but there are buses and trains near by. Even though it is near Darling Harbour, the walk to the ferry is not convenient. However, if you want to stay near shops, food, and street activity, then this would be a good location.

<Content>Quiet Treasure, great for newcomers, The best location! Close to the market, china town, darling harbour and the wonderful chinese gardens. Not to mention the transport system.This hotel is unintrusive, the staff are helpful and polite but not in your face.I have stayed there 4 times and have recommended it to my family and the directors of the company I work for, they loved it too.It's a great hotel for people new to sydney because of it's location and there is no need for cabs to get around.

<Content>Excellent location Stayed for business late May 2008. Location is excellent - walk to Darling Harbour, right next to Chinatown, monorail stations and light rail very close.Clean, room size good, and so close to so much. Make sure you book a higher room though - monorail/traffic can be noisy on lower floors.Service was professional, even at reception and concierge when busy.

<Content>Not on Darling Harbour ! We stayed at the Holiday Inn Darling Harbour for four nights as a city stop-over. We choose the Darling Harbour HI because we liked the sound of the location (Darling Harbour!) and the Trip-advisor reviews were pretty good. We had previously stayed at the HI Potts Point (which is actually in Kings Cross) so decided to give the other hotel and location a try. I would describe the hotel as average through and through, from the check-in experience, rooms, facilities and staff. The biggest disappointment however, is that the hotel is NOT on Darling Harbour ! The hotel is actually on the edge of China Town and about a 10/15 minute walk (crossing a main road) to the closest bit of Darling Harbour. Good points include easy access to the city bus services which stop just outside the hotel and a good range of excellent restaurants in China Town. If I was going to Sydney again I would try to stay in The Rocks part of town but wouldn't write off the HI Darling Harbour - just remember it isn't on the harbour !

<Content>Watch what you sign up for The hotel was nice enough, but I was there with my significant other and they gave us two twin beds. When we called down to get it resolved the first girl we talked to was NOT helpful and pretty much an airhead. The gentleman who helped us with our bags was MUCH better! He noticed the situation, went down and spoke to the manager on our behalf and they moved us immediately to another room. Although the room had a view of a cement wall at least it had a double bed. The location is within a 5 min walk of Darling Harbour.

<Content>Nice location We arrived May 25, group of 10 but only 3 rooms ready, other 2 were not. We were assigned to level 1 rooms, which for some structural/architectural design were sunken from the corridor. Bathrooms were level with the corridor. a little bit small for my comfort but sufficient otherwise. Rooms were clean, beds were neat, bath was standard ok. There were no complimentary slippers. Aircon controls were simple  accurate.There were NO electrical outlet for foreign electrical gadgets. We ask for an adopter from the front desk, but unfortunately, it was very very loose and wont work unless you hold it with both hands. Since the hotel had no more extra/spare I had to buy from a store which was pretty stiff at Aus$7.The breakfast buffet was nice  sufficient. what i find rather nice  extra-ordinary was that they provided a juicer so you can make your own fresh apple, pineapple, cellery, carrots, melon juice.The hotel was located near Chinatown so lunch/dinner was a matter of choices  more choices. It is also very near bargain shopping  the Darling harbour area.

<Content>wonderful hotel but the breakfast buffet guy is a total racist Well, this hotel is wonderful except for the racist breakfast buffet receptionist.The rooms were spacious enough and had well equipped beds and cabinets. The bed was wonderful and was a real comfort for our backs especially after an intense day of touring Sydney.The TV had enough channels and we didn't get bored with it. The furniture was also adequate and things went well.All in all, this hotel was wonderful- the housekeeping was superb and the room was really cozy for us. oh yeah, i forgot to say so but the hotel's location was really fantabulous! It was near Paddy's ( the flea market open only from Thursday to Sunday) and the attractions of Chinatown. if you stay in this hotel, food wont be a problem because of all the restaurants and kiosks just a few blocks away.BUT, here comes the pinch, as i've said several times already, the breakfast buffet receptionist was a TOTAL RACIST. He's a middle-aged Chinese guy and this is how he does his discrimination. When the guests are Caucacians (especially the blonde guests and the guys) , he's really nice and hospitable and he's like an angel. He gives the Western guests pleasant greetings and really speaks to them in a polite manner and he really hides all the rudeness in him. he's like this: Good morning sir/ ma'am! =)How are you today? having breakfast on your own or with your friends? Anyways, let me show you to your seat. =D But, when it comes to us, the Asian guests, he gets all bossy and mean plus he gets so impolite. He's like this: Hey you! X( What's your ROOM NUMBER?! COME WITH ME!!!!!!! Here!We felt that he's a very impolite receptionist because it's his job to show every guest to their seats PROPERLY and he should'nt just choose to whom he should he be polite to. And, the fact that the people he chose to despise were of the same race as him, we felt that he was very unreasonable.The most discriminating part of that receptionist's attitude was that when we were at the juicer station at the buffet, there were Caucacians sitting at the table near the station. There were three of us from our party who were helping out in making the juice so it was quite crowded that the only space i could stand on was beside the teble of the Caucacians and when the receptionist passed by, he just suddenly pushed me from where i was standingso when he could've just said 'excuse me' or asked me to move!If you're a Caucacian, you'd have fun at breakfast because he'll be all over you and he'll be really hospitable. But, if you're Asian, it'll really be annoying to deal with this receptionist.This is a good hotel, but I suggest that everyone have breakfast somewhere else instead (even if the food at the buffet is good) so that they won't experience racism at breakfast.

<Content>Great Location, great rooms Booked most of our hotels for Australia and New Zealand trip based on other trip advisor postings. Spent 4 nights in this Hotel. We made sure to ask that our room was higher up or on the other side of the hotel to avoid the noise of the monorail which runs right in front of the hotel's (about) 4th floor. Stayed on the 8th floor and had no noise problems. Room was updated, rather large, and very clean. Had a fridge in it as well. Location of this hotel is close to the train, touristy bus servive, light rail and monorail. Very easy to get around.Internet was $5 for 30 minutes, never had to wait to get in and log on. It was quick and fast, unlike some other places we stayed which took forever to upload pictures. Staff was nice enough. Concierge was kind enough to look up a few things on internet about Sydney, and make tour recommendations and food recomendations. Take note - this hotel appears to be right on the edge of Chinatown. We knew it was close, but was closer than expected. For a few nights we wandered up and down the bustling Chinatown streets and had amazing food. We just weren't prepared for that to be the main option in very close proximity. Would definately stay here again.

<Content>Lousy Service!!! We stayed there for a week. the rooms and housekeeping is ok. except that they do nor provide the basic toothbrush. though complementary, we need to call for housekeeping to get them...rooms are ok.comfy.first day when we checked in, we double confirmed with our breakfast for the week. the recept said yes, we had breakfast..all was well, when the next morning, we came down for breakfast, and we were told that our breakfast is not included in the rooms.. we gave them all references and they confirmed that no breakfast included.we were disappointed, confirmed with our agent the next day, and realised that the recept got it wrong. so the first day wasted for us. this is not the worst, no apologies.. nvm.about the internet, it is chargeable at A$0.55 per min, and a max of A$27.50 per dayso we double confirmed with the recept that max A$27.50 per day she said yes, and we only have got one point.so guess wat, we were billed double.cause me n my friend have got 2 diff laptops and this was not even stated that it is based on per computer.and when the bill arrives, the recept was rude and kept saying that... too bad... u never read... hahaworst week there!!!amenities are good, only that the service staff there sucks... beware!!SingaporePPs

<Content>Great value and location we stayed here for 2 nights 16th apr 08. great location short walk from darling harbour and next to monorail. we had a standard room on high floor and it was large clean and tidy. the hotel staff were very helpful and overall would recommend this hotel for anyone looking to stay on darling harbour for reasnable price. the breakfast was very expensive though and i would recommend venturing out instead!outside of the hotel we had some fantastic meals in particular Ice Cube in darling harbour. Fish orientated menu, great service and great value for money. Also the meat and wine restaurant was very good.

<Content>Great Hotel We needed a one night in stay in Sydney to attend a concert at the Entertainment Centre. Holiday Inn Darling Harbour could not have been any closer to the venue and is very handily located for other activities in and around Darling Harbour and Chinatown.I believe the hotel has undergone a recent renovation and had additional floor(s) added. Starting with reception everything was excellent. Desk staff were extremely courteous and efficient. The Concierge had an excellent knowledge of the city and was able to give great assistance with driving directions etc. Parking is limited and we were accomodated in the Entertainment Centre Car Park which was a short 3 minute walk.The room we had booked several months back direct through the hotel was a queen deluxe with breakfast package and we were pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade to an executive suite on one of the new upper floors. The room was great in every regard. Spacious, spotless,modern and well furnished. As we were on a high floor, monorail noise mentioned in other reviews was not an issue.Eating options at the hotel included a restaurant that served an excellent breakfast buffet and a bar/grill with a limited but good quality and well priced menu and drinks. They cater well for people attending evening concerts at the Entertainment Centre across the road. Meals are light with a reasonable choice on the special show menu.It was hard to find fault with this hotel and based on this experience we would most definitely stay again. Accor hotels often receive mediocre reviews for the perception of generic brand or sameness but to some of us there is a certain comfort in knowing what to expect quality wise. This is the case with most Holiday Inns we have stayed at. The same concept of familiarity seems to work ok for McDonalds !!. 10/10 Holiday Inn Darling Harbour.

<Content>Ideal Location- Pity About The Monorail Spent four nights at the hotel at the start of our Australian holiday.We found the hotel to be in an ideal location easy access to local transport , bus , monorail , chinatown and 5 -10 minute walk to Darling Harbour. Paddys Market is at the end of the road.The hotel room we had was very nice, large and well furnished, the facilities at the hotel are good. This is a large hotel, unfortunately our room on the first floor at the front of the building had the monorail right outside the window. Advise you ask for a room on a higher level or away from the front of the building.Sydney has so much to offer its hard to know were to start. We climbed the bridge, went on the ferry to Manly, visited the botanical gardens etc ,etc.

<Content>Just Lovely, My Favorite Hotel Stayed in the Executive Room on a high floor overlooking the Sydney Entertainment Centre and Gardens.I loved this hotel, everything about it. Lovely lighting and decor, very comfortable bed - and their hot chocolate is heavenly! I would definitely stay here again. It was very peaceful, central and well serviced!

<Content>Recent Upgrade I stay at this hotel regularly for business and pleasure. It is in a great location, right next to Chinatown, across the road from the Sydney Entertainment Centre and a short walk from Darling Harbour. They have recently renovated their bar/bistro and have also started to upgrade rooms. While it is not in the most glamorous part of the city it is well worth a visit.

<Content>very noisy i stayed only one night in this hotel in april 2008 at the end of our australian trip. The hotel is located nearby china town.I must say, that it was very noisy. We had a room at the back of the hotel and we heard the airconditioning machines from the buildings across the street. When you have a room to the street, you have the monorail directly in front of your window. So it is hard to find a quiet room.Overall the best years of this hotel are over.I also stood in the novotel darling harbour, it was cheaper and better.I would not choose this hotel again.

<Content>Better than expected The hotel was nicer than expected. We were given a good size room for the two of us and a baby. They provided the portable cot for free and when we put the cot by the window, there was still enough space for the baby to play on the floor. The TV remote has some problems and ABC channel appears black  white at times. We read previous reviews that the hotel has undergone some renovations recently and we noticed the foyer was done up quite nicely. It was great to be so close to Chinatown for some cheap meals. It was also very close to the Powerhouse Museum.

<Content>Excellent location, lovely hotel A high standard hotel in an excellent location. A short walk from Darling Harbour with plenty of attractions and places to eat and drink. We had a large room which catered very well for 3 adults. The breakfast was delicious, as was the meal we had at the hotel. Would definitely return here.

<Content>First two nights/days in Sydney We stayed for two nights before heading for the outback. Room was comfortable and decent size. Nicely located to see the lower CBD and Darling Harbour. Good breakfast buffet. Monorail stopped nearby and it was a short walk to Darling Harbour, China Town and Paddy's Market. Downside was the internet access was high speed CAT5 cable, no Wifi. Pricey but it seems to be the way of it in Sydney lately.

<Content>Great Location and Good Value This Hotel is near Darling Harbour and not on the waterfront. The location is excellent and in our opinion better than the Sydney Harbour Holiday Inn. It is less than 5 min walk to Darling Harbour and the excelent eating/drinking establishments there. It is also very near Chinatown, the light rail and the monorail.The staff were helpful and the value for money excellent. The rooms are small but adequate and very clean.We would stay there again and would recmomend this hotel and area for 1st time visitors to Sydney. It was an excelent choice as we were there for 4 days before a cruise.

<Content>Good for conference I stayed here for a few days when at a conference in early November 2007. Contrary to some of the other posts here I found the staff very helpful. The rooms are adequate (if a little on the small side) but the location is great. Chinatown is to the rear and a short walk to convention centre.

<Content>Lived to tell. I stayed here with 40 other students for a study abroad program. I was there at the hotel for almost two weeks! The beds were comfortable. The rooms were clean. The dining at the hotel was okay. The staff was extremely helpful. (Jeffie was my favorite!!) The location was great at first then after a week or two you want to be in a different area besides chinatown. The hotel was just across the street from darling harbor, which was convienient. Overall I wouldn't probably stay there again, but it was prearranged with my study abroad program. But then again, I never ever stay at a Holiday Inn, but for a Holiday Inn it wasn't bad at all. It was almost like staying at their sister hotel the Crown Plaza, but just not as nice.

<Content>Surprise construction ruined anniversary stay This hotel is under heavy construction. They are adding floors, so there is heavy equipment on the roof, which creates tremendous vibration and noise. I made two advance calls to the hotel to ask about room size and location, as this was an anniversary trip. Nothing was said about the construction. The night before arrival, I called them again to verify that we would have an upper floor/view location and, again, not a word was said about the construction--particularly amazing given my request for an upper floor. The room was attractive, but who cared? When I complained to the manager on duty, he said that the hotel had put this info on their website for months (not true), and that all desk/reservation personnel had been trained to tell guests --also absolutely not true. He refused any request for a discount or anything at all - too bad, live with it, we told you, it's your fault. Also, construction was supposed to begin at 9 a.m., but on the Saturday we left, it was well underway by 7 a.m. Avoid this place like the plague it is.

<Content>Good Hotel, Good Location We stayed at the Holiday Inn for 6 nights at the beginning of November.The location is very good 鈥?a 5 min walk to Darling Harbor and probably a 20 min walk to Sydney Harbor. We found the hotel to be clean and in good decorative order with contemporary furnishings. Our 鈥楺ueen Bed Superior Room鈥?was quite roomy with plenty of space to put luggage down. The bed was comfortable and we found the hotel to be very quiet which made it easy to get to sleep at night. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant only on one morning and we found the buffet to be splendid with a good choice of hot and cold food. Overall staff at the hotel were friendly, although I did find them somewhat uncooperative when they tried to throw us out after they bungled our reservation 鈥?still waiting for an apology for that! I would stay at this hotel again without hesitation.

<Content>Nice hotel. Convenient Location I chose this hotel mainly because it was one of the few 4+ star hotels not to jack their prices up considerably due to a soccer match being held the same night (which was the purpose of my trip anyway).The mention of Darling Harbour in the title is a bit of a misnomer, as it is one street off Chinatown, yet a good 10-15 min walk to the heart of Darling Harbour.The hotel is directly across the road from the Sydney Entertainment Centre. Very convenient for those attending concerts or basketball matches at that venue.Express checkout was very convenient. Porters and Front desk staff were quite friendly and efficient.The one downside is the power switch at the door (like many hotels these days) requires your room key to be inserted (or an unneeded card of any type will do). Housekeeping will remove the card if you are absent. In my case, my mobile phone and laptop failed to charge fully.Had absolutely no issue with the renovations at the property. There are many notices in the hotel advising of the renovations and the times you will experience noise (which from memory was from 0830-1800).While I did hear a bit of noise during those times, it wasn't enough to annoy me (maybe I picked a good day).

<Content>Great location, shabby rooms, renovations involve lots of grinding This was a Priority Club PointBreaks award stay for me - the hotel is offering award nights for only 5,000 points, probably because of the renovations. During the day there is a lot of grinder/jackhammer noise going on, though evenings and mornings until 8:30 AM are quiet.With my award stay my effective rate is US$50 per night - and I wouldn't pay more to stay here in the future. While its Darling Harbour location is very good and you can easily walk to the DH sights and attractions, the rooms themselves are shabby and not well maintained. Furniture is marred, nicked, scratched and worn. My room had several obvious paint patches, some of which are drywall patches that haven't been re-painted to match. Sheer drapes are yellowed and worn. The bathroom is small and outdated. Hallway carpet is appalling in its appearance and hallways have a musty odor. Cleanliness in the rooms seems good - the property simply isn't spending on maintenance.The king bed was comfortable though on casters, for some reason, making it move a bit when you got in. TV channel selection is about 12 channels. Views are so-so at best and there are no real water views from this hotel.If location is your priority you might consider this property at a very low rate. Otherwise, there are many better choices in Darling Harbour.

<Content>It'll be great when it's finished. The location of this hotel is fantastic, 5 minutes from Darling Harbour and right next to China Town and Paddy's market. The room was great (I had a upgrade) and for me pretty quiet.The biggest problem with this hotel is the reception, it's probably the worst run front desk I've ever seen. Nothing happens unless there's a manager present, they are completely disorganised, long queues were utterly ignored and the noise levels - echoes and background noise rather than building work related, made it a real battle to be heard. That said the concierge desk was excellent, really effecient, friendly and helpful; in stark contrast to the reception across the hall.The building work, they're adding extra floor wasn't too intrusive for me and I guess the hassle factor it did create was reflected in the good rate I got.

<Content>Dreadfull Hotel My parents stayed at this hotel last year and found it to be excellent and this is why I chose this hotel.BUT while the bed was Comfortable and the room tidy it was very noisy due to overlooking the back laneway. I was allocated a non smoking room but torists were smoking on the floor so smelled strongly of cigarette smoke.Room was booked direct with Hotel (not their website) and credit card number taken so room could be charged to the card. I was advised this was all fine. HOWEVER on arriving at hotel was told this was not noted on their records and I would have to pay cash for the room plus a A$100 deposit before they would hand over the room keys.Staff on front desk extremely rude and uncoperative. I intend to tell all my friends about this hotel and myself or none of my family will every stay at a here again.

<Content>Good Location, Nice room The hotel is currently under going work on the restuarant and they are adding further rooms to the top floor of the oldest part of the building. However, we asked for a room away from the work and I have to be honest, we did not hear a thing.The room was clean, well decorated but on the small side. Having said that, there is so much to do in Sydney we only returned to the room to sleep.The monorail also passes extremely close to the hotel (again as our room was at the back of the hotel, this did not disturb us). The hotel was a 15 minute walk to Darling Harbour which has lots of bars and restuarants and also the ferry service to Sydney Harbour. The hotel itself is two minutes from China Town.All in all, a pleasant stay.

<Content>An awful stay Stayed here for 4 nights. This would be the worst place I have stayed, staff were totally imcopetent and rude and when we finally got food it was not fit for human consumption. Everything was blamed on alterations taking place, even the fact that drinks could not be supplied. Rooms were not clean and smelt musty. Looked like there had been a flood in our room. Backpackers lodge would be better and you would be treated better. Staff up to management level were not interested in complaints either.

<Content>A disappointment We have just stayed at Holiday Inn for 6 days. This is not our first time staying here but this time was a real disappointment. We booked our accommodation a long time before our stay, we were give a rate which was very reasonable and were told this had to be paid straight away to get that rate, well after many phone calls to them when we arrived for our stay the charge had still not been put through and when we left it was still not charged. Finally after we were home the charge went through on credit card, and we are not happy with the charge but have not received an emailed invoice which we had asked for.Our room was not cleaned while we were there, clean towels were supplied and that was all. I spilled some tea on the floor on our first night and it was still there when we left, and rubbish bins were not emptied, but biscuits which we had bought did disappear. On our last night I had a call from housekeeping to ask if we were happy with the cleaning. I had not at that stage mentioned anything to them about it, so this indicates to me they must of had other complaints re housekeeping.One night we attempted to have a snack meal in the restaraunt, this was necessary as the bar was closed for renovations, something I think we should of been told before we arrived, because as we were there in a group, this was a place we had used alot on previous visits. This meal would have to be the worst dining experience I have had anywhere. On entering the restaruant we were told by other guests just leaving not to go there as it was terrible, as we were only having snacks we thought it should be ok, how wrong were were. There we 10 of us in our group, we all ordered drinks, of which our first two choices of wine and beer were not available, in the end out of 10 of us 3 people got a drink. The food was not much better, most of it was cold, and most was sent back, to be reheated. In the end 2 of our group left with nothing to eat at all. The staff on duty were very rude and immature, even slamming doors. When we said we were going to complain the attitude of the manager that night, changed and she tried to be oh so pleasant. They did not charge us for the 3 drinks in the end, but this was far from satisfactory. We made a written complaint to the hotel to which no reply has been received. We have stayed here many times before and the location is just fabulous. This time has been a real let down.Once before when we stayed we had a really noisy room and as the hotel was full we could not be moved, I was told that on my next visit I would receive a discount, this has never been received. I feel that the communication skills of the staff need to be addressed.

<Content>Bad experience Have just finished a 7 night stay from 25/09/07 through to 02/10/07 which was not a particularly pleasant experience.Admittedly the hotel is undergoing renovation but this should not be an excuse for poor service and quality. We have stayed at this hotel in the past because of its excellent location. I have also recommeded to several friends who also used the facility.This time around we encountered the following problems:-Walls painted in the hotel with no signage indicating wet paint. My husband ruined a new shirt through this. Hotel tried to have shirt cleaned but it was ruined. After 4 days agreed to credit the value of the shirt. Offer was not made willingly - I had to complain a second time before it was done..Group of 10 went to restaurant for a snack meal. As we were entering the restaurant we were told by guests that their meal had been terrible. They had eaten from the main menu. As we only wanted snack meals eg burgers  chips etc decided to carry on as surely this couldn't cause problems. 2 different bottles of wine ordered along with beers. After around 15 minutes told that neither wine was avaliable due to renovations and also beer chosen not avaliabe. Reordered 2 more wines and beers to again be told not avaliabe due to renovations. The result was after 30 minutes 3 out of 10 had drinks. When the food arrived this was another disaster. Remember we had only ordered snack meals. Some meals only just warm and others cold. Some meals sent back to kitchen to come out again cold. At this stage we decided to leave - some of the meals sent back to kitchen for 2nd time. After complaining to restaurant mangager we were given a credit for the 3 drinks we had ordered - 2 beers and one soft drink. Paid only for the food eaten.On checkout I was told I had a phone call to NZ for 1hr 11mins and 22 seconds total charge $152. I had called home that morning for around 5 mins to confirm arrival time. Agreed with hotel an amount I would pay. I had experienced problems with the phone getting a dial tone and maybe there was something faulty. I was made to feel that they were doing me a favour by not charging me for the whole 1hour plus.Have put my complaints in writing and I am waiting to see if I get a response before deciding whether to use this facility again.Will keep this updated.

<Content>Good value short stay Stayed here for two nights in January with our teenage children. I think they did a fantastic job considering Sydney and this hotel was packed with England cricket fans. Staff were friendly and helpful. The cheaper restaurant downstairs was great for children, if a little lively. The room was perfect for what we wanted; two queen beds and coffee-making area. It was clean, modern and in a great location. What more could you want?

<Content>Good location We booked for one night as we were flying out of Sydney the next morning. Whenen we arrived at the hotel, we were told that we were upgraded to a suite from the standard room we had booked for one night. The hotel is currently undergoing remodeling, and we found that it was either directly above to next door to the upgraded room we were put in. Starting around 8am, the drills started and it was incredibly disturbing. I suppose for the majority of tourists who are out an about during the day, it's not a problem, but we were sleeping in to catch a mid afternoon flight and were unable to sleep through the noise. Additionally, our room appeared to be through some remodeling with new carpet (but missing molding on the walls), and a new bathroom with separate shower from tub, and a very large living/work space with internet access (around $0.55 per minute). There was a mid afternoon heavy rainstorm and we found one of the windows failed to have proper seals and water came into the room. It wasn't enough to flood, however, it probably damaged their walls.The location of the hotel is okay, right in Darling Harbour and in Chinatown, and close to the train station. One of the hotel restaurant/pub is currently undergoing renovation, and so there was one restaurant open and the menu looked okay though it was a bit pricey (but we found all hotel restaurant food to be pricey on our trip).We didn't have a problem with the service of staff, and check in/out was fairly easy.

<Content>Great Choice My wife and I stayed here for a week. Our room was comfortable and quiet. There was a small regfrigerator filled with mini-bar items, but we had space to put some fruit and cold drinks. There is a gym on site, and a couple of coin-operated washers and dryers for hotel guests.You can't beat the location of this hotel. It's steps away from Darling Harbour, right across the street from Paddy's Market and an adjacent supermarket, and smack dab in Chinatown. In fact, we discovered the finest Chinese restaurant on the planet just around the corner from the hotel. It's called Red Chili. Don't miss it.Food at the hotel restaurants, including breakfast, is expensive. I'd recommend going to one of the local bakery/coffee shops a few blocks away on George Street for a quick bite in the mornings. You'll find two metro stops within about a five-ten minute walk from the hotel.

<Content>great location, bad service stayed at the darling harbour holiday inn. The location was great, right there at China town, restaurants everywhere, the monorail station is also nearby. Paddy's market is like 2 mins walk. Rooms were however very small. We were given the 1st floor rooms, and we were right under the monorail track, however noise was not a problem.Service is terrible. Staffs at the front desk were impatient, I made an enquiry about internet access from the room and the person on the phone was rude and unhelpful. Very shocking and unpleasant encounter.

<Content>Excellent buy for the money! Stayed for 4 nights at the Holiday Inn Darling Harbor, June 2007. Only (minor) complaint is room set up. As we arrived extremely early in the morning, room assigned on the 2nd floor was fully acceptable. After 2 nights, being seniors, requested if we could change to a room without the compulsory 4-steps from the room to the bathroom/closet/entry area. Not a problem. Concierge assistance excellent! Speak with Takeshi Hirama, he is most knowledgeable and willing to assist. Can't wait to return, stay there again. Definitely enjoy breakfast at McDonald's, across the street, in lieu of the restaurant buffet. Buffett is quite pricey!

<Content>Huge, comfy bed! Fantastic location (we were there 3 days and were able to walk everywhere)! The only downside was that we hadn't booked in advance but just turned up when we got to Sydney so it was quite expensive. Having said that, the facilities were excellent, the service was outstanding and the staff very helpful with regard to parking, transport and directions.

<Content>good choice for Sydney This hotel is ideally situated close to the Darling Harbour recreation/entertainment area of Sydney. Actually, it's more between Chinatown and Darling Harbour, but the beautiful harborside itself with a multitude of museums, activities, gardens, restaurants and shops is within easy walking distance.You won't get any surprises with this hotel if you've stayed at Holiday Inns before. Service is efficient, rooms are well-maintained and the hotel has everything you need for a decent stay. The building is not particularly new or unique, but compared to other hotels in Sydney it's a good deal; the Old Sydney Holiday Inn is substantially more expensive, for example.Chinatown's Dixon Street is an interesting stroll just behind the hotel, and the nearby huge Market City complex is a fun place to shop for souvenirs, branded goods and food.Overall this is a solid choice when factoring price vs. accomodations, recreational opportunities and transportation access.

<Content>Excellent place, excellent price The Holiday Inn Darling Harbour is a great location! We had a fabulous time in a wonderful city! Regarding the hotel, it is very nice-- It has all the basics you will need. It's not too fancy or extravagant, but the hotel is clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful! If you are looking for a nice hotel, this is the one. I would strongly recommend it.

<Content>Great central location This hotel is very central to everything in Sydney such as Chinatown, the shopping district and the beautiful Darling Harbour.The staff were always friendly and helpful.  The only slight downside for us was that we were staying on a room only basis and ravenously hungry on the first morning of our stay after arriving from England we found that the breakfast was very expensive compared to a lot of other places so we decided to leave the hotel and have a McDonalds breakfast which is just over the road next to the Entertainment centre.Nice clean rooms that were large enough for us and our two children and not at all noisy.

<Content>Excellent discounted rooms I've just stayed two nights in Darling Harbour with my 5yo son at theHoliday Inn on Harbour St, opposite the Entertainment Centre (which was therefore the view) and next to a monorail stop, the tram line and Paddy's Markets. It was amazingly quiet as the road directly outside seems to be a restricted access one with hardly any traffic. I booked the twin room through one of the websites that pop up when you google 'discount holidays sydney' or some such, and got it for $139 per night. This was a good price given the quality and standard of accommodation - lovely big, air conditioned room, comfortable beds, still new carpet, clean walls, Foxtel, gameboy facilities, internet; lovely bathroom with shower over bath and plenty of space. Complimentary everything ie shampoo and conditioner, shower cap etc, tea, coffee, milk - the only possible catch being the non-complimentary wine, orange juice, chocolates, muesli bars, crisps, soft drink etc which are also provided at exorbitant cost should you lack the discipline to resist them! Food at the in-house restaurants was also expensive to my mind although comparable with other classy restaurants in the area. We ate our own food for brekky and packed lunch, and ate elsewhere the 1st night. On the 2nd night I found I was able to get a decent room service meal for both of us by orderingfrom the kids menu - we had battered fish with steamed vegies, fruit salad  ice cream, about $18 and the single serves were easily big enough for both of us. Service at this hotel was impeccable and security is excellent as everything operates on cards. We were able to go from our hotel room to the Aquarium and other attractions without folding up our stroller! So if you're traveling with a young child or if you are yourself reliant on wheels through a disability, this is an excellent place to stay. If you're travelling on the cheap, treat yourself by searching 6 or 7 days ahead and booking the less popular, discounted nights. Our room went up to $199 if we'd wanted to stay a 3rd night.

<Content>Good hotel, good location We spent three nights in the Holiday Inn Darling Harbour and considered it a good hotel.Fair for the price. Helpful staff, clean rooms, good bar.Walking distance to Darling Harbour - through a nice park too. From here you can get a ferry to Circular Quay which is a nicer way to get around Sydney.The monorail stops right by the hotel so it is easy to get to from the centre (by the Tower and around that area).We'd stay again.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location My boyfriend and I stayed at this Holiday Inn. We booked it at the airport when we got in. See, we are airline employee travelers and didn't know when we could get on a flight to SYD. At first, the room we booked was not available. We were suppose to get a nonsmoking room with a double bed. They gave us a choice of a smoking room with a double bed or a nonsmoking with two twins. Luckily a manager was nearby and told the girl to give us an upgrade. She was reluctant to do it, so the guy did it for us. I would have been disappointed otherwise after flying 14 hours from SFO and not being able to sleep next to my boyfriend or dying in a smoking room. Other than that, the only downfall is that it does not have a pool for the hot summer months. Also, do not buy into the mini bar. You can go around the corner to a bottle shop and get alcohol for HALF the price. It was around 7.50 AU for a bottle of Bacardi. It's not cheap in Sydney.The location was great. There is a little fast food place called Aporto's that we just fell in love with for a quick breakfast or lunch. Across the street is Patty's, a great and cheap place for gifts. You can also walk to Darling Harbour, which is where we spent most of our time. The subway is a good walk away, but not too far. That will take you to the Opera House. I thought the hotel was a little pricey, but so were all the others. It was a nicer Holiday Inn at least with the room we got. We paid about $800 for 5 nights, I believe.

<Content>Nice We liked this hotel, there is complementary fresh fruit and water in your room each day, there rooms were very clean and modern, a magnifying mirror for makeup and shaving, lots of soap and shampoo, they supplied terrycloth robes and slippers being from the states it was our first encounter with the tea pot for boiling water but it worked great and the instant coffee was fine for a morning start. The Consignor staff was very helpful. The location, across the street is the market and stop for the monorail and the red Sydney explorer bus. One street behind the hotel is China Town; on Friday night they close the street and have an open market, three blocks walk to Darling Harbor, and a few blocks to George Street for the busses and train stop. The only point of contention was there in room internet service was expensive this is true thru out Australia.

<Content>a very good hotel to explore sydney from my wife and I and two relatives stayed two nites at the end of a cruise, our first time to Sydney - The Holiday Inn is well maintained and well managed and in a very good central location to explore all of Sydney ( Sydney is large enough and has seperate areas to explore that no hotel will be perfect for everywhere, but this is a good compromise ). Price was a fair value for the area, our only comment was the $25 asd per day for in room internet access is a bit steep.

<Content>Excellent base to explore Sydney The hotel is very well situated in close proximity to both China Town and Darling Harbour with all of its restaurants, shopping  bars. There are also transport links nearby with the monorail, tram and train stations all located close to the hotel which can take you into town, circular quay or further afield.The hotel itself is clean  functional but by no means luxurious. We had a high floor so were not bothered by the noise and i would recommend anybody booking the hotel requests to be higher up as there is a busy street  monorail line close to the lower rooms. The room was fine for a base to explore from with a comfy bed and reasonable bathroom, if you are looking for luxury then go elsewhere.We really enjoyed our week long stay at the hotel and would definately recommend it to others.

<Content>Great Location Stayed here for 3 nights in what they call a family room as there were 3 of us, essentially it was a normal room with 2 Queen beds. Check in was quick but average, I had requested a high floor thanks to previous post about possible noise from monorail which the girl completely ignored and gave us level 2, but upon telling her this was not suitable she promptly changed. Room was comfortable and clean with all the usual bits and bobs that you get at a Holiday Inn property. That evening we had houskeeping knock on the door to see that everything was to our liking and gave us each a tim tam! That was different! This property is just fantastic as far as location goes, in front of china town mall, 100mtrs from Paddy's markets and both the monorail and tram stations, Mc donalds across the road and a 5 - 10 min walk to all the great attractions darling harbour has to offer. Had two great concierges at the hotel that we dealt with and one completly sour fellow who should not be in the industry. All in all a great stay and would jump at the chance to stay there again.

<Content>Respectable A decent hotel in a convenient location, at the west end of Darling Harbour. We had a small suite on the 9th floor (an upgrade from the queen room we had reserved). The hallway carpets were disgustingly dirty, but the suite itself was fine, although unremarkable. As other reviewers have noted, the monorail runs right in front of the hotel, at the level of the second floor. We could barely hear it from our floor, so it wasn鈥檛 an issue for us, but I can imagine that it would be more of a nuisance lower down. The minibar fridge was turned off, so it and the drinks in it were warm, and the ice cube tray contained warm water. The only alternative for ice was to call room service, which wasn鈥檛 an appealing option.

<Content>value option Centrally located about 10min walk to Darling Harbour/Central railway station and next to monorail station. Rooms were quite basic- this is not a 5 star hotel- but it was comfortable enough. As far as city accommodation goes it is reasonable value for money but if your looking for stylish accommodation look elsewhere. A cramped gym but had all the equipment needed in good condition - there was no pool but a small spa next to the gym ( entry through laundry)Didnt try the restaurant but bar next door served as a good starting ending point for the evening.

<Content>Good location Good sized, clean room. Opposite the monorail and entertainment centre (we were suprised to discover that Kylie was performing there during our stay). Short walk to Darling Harbour and next to China Town.We had a nice meal in the lounge bar but have to say that the decor was a little dated. In all,this was an ideal hotel for our needs - comfortable and central for touring.

<Content>Fantastic  Me and my fiancee victoria went to australia to visit some of her familiy in a small town called Appin located in the suburbs of sydney which was excellent. we also stayed in the holiday inn at darling harbour in the heart of sydney for 2 nights staff and guests alike where very friendly. the rooms where a good size with a fully stocked min bar TV and king size bed.we ate out on both nights by darling harbour nice and romantic for couples with candle lit dinners. there is a ton of restaurants that will cater for everyones tastes whether that be a nice big steak or lobster both which was very nice. its not to expensive either although in coparison to some places in sydney it is with a whole lobster costing $40. A typical meal for two on darling harbour including starter and drinks is a between $80 - $100 after the meal there are plenty of bars and clubs to visit with a glass of wine and a beer costing around $8 which is 拢4, cheap compared to english prices. there is also a casino near by that was very good and intersting.through the day there is loads of stuff to do. if you dont fancy going to far there is an aquarium and martime musem just a short walk from the hotel. if you like to shop there are hundreds of shops and centres to visit. also there are banks such as the hsbc that i used free of charge. if none of that works for you, you can take a ferry to manly and spend the day there it takes about 30 mins on the ferry or take a ferry to sydney zoo ro just take a water taxi around sydney and get an excellent view of the opera house and the harbour bridge as you pass by. two other attractions worth doing but only on a clear day is the harbour bridge walk. Walk over the top of the bridge with a guide the views are amazing, although it is quite expensive costing $180 per person very worth while. The other thing to do is sydney tower again wait until its clear this costs $20 per person but you get a view of the whole city and ona clear day manly and the surronding areas.definatly going again hopefully sooner rather thatn later, brilliant experience.

<Content>Fantastic Bang For the Buck I found the Holiday Inn Darling Harbour to be a bargain compared to other hotels in Sydney.The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Factor in the friendly staff and good location with a very reasonable price and you have a smart selection for the budget traveller (but not too budget!).Lots of tourist sites, a plethora of restaurants and shopping areas within walking distance from this hotel.This is a solid choice for those who don鈥檛 need a four-star accommodation, but still want a well-kept, comfortable and centrally-located hotel.

<Content>Good Location and Price for Sydney Sydney is not the cheapest place in the world to stay, especially if you want a property that a reasonably central and clean and comfortable. This hotel is 5 minutes walk from Darling Harbour - cross the road and go around the back of the bar on the other side and from there on it is pedestrians only. The hotel itself is midern, well-equipped and well-run. Clean and comfortable, offering all you need for a stay in the big city. Prices are low if you book in advance and represent good value. I would not hesitate to return.

<Content>Very Nice We never heard the monorail from inside of the hotel. We liked having slot machines inside of the bar in the hotel. The room was clean with plenty of room for the 3 of us. We never had any problems with the staff. They were soooo nice and friendly. We stayed for 3 nights and enjoyed them all. If we ever go back to Australia we would stay again for sure. China town is right outside your door as well as Paddys Market....a great place to get some great deals on just about anything.

<Content>4 OUT OF 5 For a pretty central position in Sydney, the price we paid was very good value. The stay for the first 4 nights had been perfect but on our last day it went wrong for 2 reasons.1) Young drunk neighbours returned in the early hours making lots of noise so we were unable to sleep. It was like staying in a very expensive backpackers.2) We left our bags with staff after we checked out and when we returned to the hotel for pick up to the airport, the bags were missing. The hotel had no clue where they had put them.Time for pick up was getting ever closer and they had run out of ideas. Fortunately whilst kicking up a fuss an elderly English lady came over and said that 2 bags similar to what she had heard us say were put on a coach outside the hotel. The staff denied this but stopped the coach leaving, bags were taken off to find our missing luggage.It was an unnecessary situation and dealt with unprofessionally.Other than the bad luck(?) of the last night I would stay there again.

<Content>From Queensland Australia Spent 3 nights at the Holiday Inn. There was a mix-up with the room due to the booking agent giving us a twin room, but the hotel fixed this up immediately. Nice walk to Darling harbour. Convenient for the monorail, China Town and the Designer outlet stores :) at Paddy's market. Staff were pleasant and helpful at all times. The Breakfast was good! Loved the Turkey bacon. Didn't find the juice extractor annoying like a previous reviewer, but the coffee service was a bit slow at times. The gym facilities on the 3rd floor were good, and included a spa, steam room and sauna. You've got to be quick on the draw with your keycard in the lift. If not, you might end up getting there via the top floor. Try the Asian foodhalls around behind the hotel. They were great and inexpensive. Very handy for the Sydney Entertainment Centre. If you're going to a show, this is ideal accomodation. Think about an audience of 11,000 people trying to get in and out of there. We just walked across the road :) It was a better experience that trying to get a taxi from the Opera House the previous night.

<Content>good location Stayed here for two nights, room was a good size, we had the executive suite with seperate bedroom and huge ensuite with great ameneties(red earth) 4 towels not the usual 2 and bathrobes. Fruit daily was 2 apples so didn't get overly excited about that, room service very pricey, bottle of wine was $30 then you have room service charge and then a gratuity tax, so there are plenty of bottle of shops around where you can get wine at a 1/4 of the price. Huge tvs in living and bedroom, nice comfy beds with Duvets, we were on the elevnth floor so read tripadvisor like I did as it is well worth the effort . You just might get the monorail zooming past your window. Walking distance to the city, we got the mono rail and paid $18 for 2 on all day ticket, but really isn't necessary if you are capable of walking. Only one reall hiccup and that was that our door was left open while we were out by staff and wasn't offered any reall compensation for the stress involved, have an idea it was like that for quite a few hours, as my personal belongings and our laptop was there, although the lift has good security, have to swipe your card to go up so a bit hard if anyone else was to get in the lift. just a rude shock to come back and find it open, well worth joining the priority club ( cost nothing ) normally you would pay an extra night just for these extras. as we were able to get our room at 10 am on availability and check out was 2 pm, good when you are flying with Jetstar and their stupid flight times back to darwin, all over was a very nice stay and accidents can happen but could be costly

<Content>Had a Great Time Our trip to Australia was to visit our daughter and family who are there for a one year teacher's exchange. For a side trip we took to Sydney we booked the Darling Harbour Holiday Inn from May 24th to the 27th. What great place to stay, very central and easy to get to everything. The rooms are very clean and modern, comfortable and the staff are very friendly and helpful. We ate one evening in the bar/lounge area, the food was satisfactory but not that great. Paddy's Market is a must do, it is just a few steps from the hotel and Chinatown is there as well. We took a tour bus and were able to get on and off at the stops along the way, a great way to see the city. We booked this hotel using our Priority Club Rewards and it was great! I would highly recommend this property to anyone.

<Content>Can't Go Wrong With The Holiday Inn, Darling Harbour We stayed at the Darling Harbour for a week in July. We were very pleased with this hotel. The hotel is resonably priced and the rooms are comfortable and not a bad size for the price.The hotel is within walking distance of Darling Harbour and all the restaurants and shops there. It's a very enjoyable walk by fountains and palm trees with cranes perched in them.Near the hotel is The Power House Museum, a fascinating on hands museum that I highly advise seeing. Also by the hotel is the Chinese Garden. It's so beautiful and peaceful, it shoulden't be missed. They also offer a fun activity there. For ten dollars a person, Australian, you can dress in beautiful Chinese robes and the staff will take your picture with your camera. For half an hour you can walk around the garden in costume and take pictures. It's so much fun and such a different memento to take home!!!We were very happy with the staff at the hotel. They were very happy to give ideas for tour companies for day trips and to give directions when were walking in the city. They were also extremely helpful with getting us a shuttle back to the airport.The bell boys were especially friendly and helpful. Whenever they would see us in the lobby they would greet us and were very interested in what we had done that day. They gave us good advice on places to see!We loved our week in Sydney and at the Darling Harbour Holiday Inn! We can't wait till our next trip there, I wish it was tomorrow!!!!!

<Content>Great location hotel This hotel is in a fantastic location! Ten minutes walk from Centeral Station. Light rail and monorail 200 meters from hotel. The hotel in located in China Town and right across the street from Sydney Entertainment Center.The staff were friendly and the rooms could use slight more modern decor, but they did do a nice job with cleaning. Even received turn down service the first nights stay with Tim Tams!As for a room above the 3rd floor because the monorail runs directly in front of the hotel.

<Content>All round good hotel... We stayed here for 5 nights in April 2006 and found it to be a convenient location, good value, clean, comfortable hotel. I would probably class the location as China town, not Darling Harbour but it's only about a 5 min walk to all the bars and restaurants of Darling Harbour and the monorail station is practically right outside to get you around the city. For the money, I would deffinately reccomend this hotel, the service was good, our safe didn't work when we arrived but they sent someone immediately to fix it. Sydney is now one of my favourite citys in the world and I would stay here again without a doubt.

<Content>Location, Location, Location !!!!! Just returned from a 5 day stay. Hotel is centrally located, with most major attractions within reasonable walking distance. Having the Sydney Explorer bus stop across the road was a bonus.The rooms were of a good size and were clean and the beds comfortable. We paid $171/ night including buffet breakfast for 2 people.Couple of minor crticism's, would have liked a change to the buffet breakfast selections. The only variety was they alternated daily between baked beans and spaghetti to go with the bacon,mushrooms, hash browns,tomatoes and scrambled eggs. The other annoyance was the noisy juice extractor people were using to make fresh fruit juices.We ate a couple of times in JB'S bar and grill, the food was well cooked and reasonably priced. Not many people appeared to use the main restaurant in the evenings.We would definitely stay here again

<Content>Great location, good hotel Stayed two nights upon arrival in Sydney from Canada. Got to the hotel at about 9:30 am and were given access to our room early which was lovely after a 17 flight! Good room - great shower, try and ask not to stay on the street side as the monorail starts at about 6am. Nice staff, clean room - was a good stay. Hay Market is not open Monday-Wednesday so the value of the location does decrease slightly if you are staying those days. Highly recommend the Thai massage clinic around the corner on Hay!

<Content>Perfect location in Sydney! The hotel looked a little old but it was recently renovated which was the primary reason I chose this place. The 3-night stay with breakfast was part of the Austrian Airline package. We had a superior room on the 4th floor just above the monorail track which for some fortunate reason did not pose as a deterrent during our stay there. The room was pretty sound proofed. But I'm impressed with its superb location just a minute walk to Chinatown with lots of shops and restaurants along George Street. The room is very clean and I must compliment the hotel housekeeping for its efficiency to be applauded with. The concierge service can be further improved. The potter just left our luggage in the lobby and did not even bother to ask if we needed baggage service up to our rooms. Another setback is the elevator service. We had to wait quite long because one elevator was down during our entire stay and the hotel was pretty packed because the elevators were always full. For these 2 reasons, I'm not giving an excellent review. But overall, we had a pleasant stay. Our visitors liked the place because they could pick and drop us off very easily without the hassle of heavy traffic as the front entrance of the hotel was located on a quieter side with very scarce traffic flow. I'd definitely recommend this hotel to friends.

<Content>Good hotel and locatiion We spent 5 nights here at the end of our trip to Australia. We were pleasantly surprised to receive a room on the top floor, which gave us a nice view of the city, and was on the side of the building so we didn't have to worry about the noise of the tram. The room was what you would expect of a Holiday Inn, with one bed, a chair, a desk, refrigerator, etc. The air conditioning would only work if you put your key in a slot near the controls, which I assume is to save energy. The room was clean and the service was good. The only complaint I had was that they are renovating the elevators and only one seemed to be working consistently. The other would stop at every floor, whether you pushed the button or not, which is not fun in an already overcrowded elevator travelling through 11 floors. It is a 5 min walk to darling harbour and the ferry, and across from a market place. We took a cab to the opera one night and it was about $13 AUD. If you want to be close to Circular Qauy and the Opera House, then you may want to look elsewhere. We generally walked from the hotel to the Quay and it took 15 to 20 mins, but was pleasant. We would certainly consider staying here again if we were fortunate enough to revisit Australia.

<Content>Very good - Value for money We stayed at the holiday inn for 3 nights and found the hotel extremely good and great value for money. Its within a 5 minute walk to the darling harbour and just 10 mins from the main shopping district - George street. Despite this, the location is very peaceful. The monorail running along the hotel is no disturbance whatsoever and infact gives a better look to the hotel. The staff were very friendly and always ready to help. The hotel staff really takes care of you as we recd a bottle of champagne the first night. This hotel is definately highly recommended and we are for sure going back the next time in Sydney.

<Content>great location I just returned from a week at the Holiday Inn Darling Harbour. It was typical of the chain. I paid 160 AUD and stayed in a 34 SQ meter room which included a sofabed, a wing chair, a desk and a bar top with cabinets below that held the refrigerator and mini bar. The room was clean and spacious with everything in working order, except for the sofa, which they changed at my request. The bath was clean and spacious. The entire staff was friendly, courteous, and helpful. 2 restaurants with a good selection.  The location was great because it sits on the edge of China Town, Darling Harbour (a 5 minute walk), Central Train Station (a 10 minute walk unless you take the light rail that is located directly across the street), next door to a large mall and a market(open Thur-Sun), McDonalds across the street (if you are not a full breakfast person or do not want to pay $22), and a 24 hr internet shop across the street. I would stay here again and would recommend it.

<Content>Excellent location and value, helpful staff. Recommended. For about Aus$180 a night (about拢80 sterling)the Holiday Inn, Darling Harbour is excellent value for money. It's pretty functional, certainly not luxurious but the rooms are large, bathrooms very good and the location (within China Town) ideal for eating out (the Szeuchan restaurant immediately behind the hotel is outstanding). Darling Harbour is a very pleasant five minute walk away.Staff could not have been more helpful, responding flexibly when our backpacking daughter arrived to stay with us. We were upgraded to a double Queen room without charge.

<Content>Great location, nice rooms, helpful staff. Stayed at this hotel in Nov 2005 for two 5-day stretches. Paid $150 UAD per night for two people. This hotel has an excellent location--right near Darling Harbour and next to Sydney's Chinatown. Walking distance to main shopping area of downtown Sydney, and to Sydney Harbour (15 minute walk). 10 minute walk to Central Train Station. Rooms are spacious, newly-updated, and clean. Make sure you ask for a room above the 3rd floor (skytrain runs alongside the hotel). Concierge and desk staff were very helpful and pleasant. There is guest laundry and very small hottub and small gym on site. Location couldn't be better, and we felt safe walking in the area and staying at this hotel. Reservations made easily over the Holiday Inn internet site. We would definitely stay here again. A bit pricey but hotels are pricey in Sydney and often hard to get a room.

<Content>Good Value We stayed in this hotel 4 nights in mid December. The location is perfect; you are not more than 5 min by foot to Darling Harbour and all restaurants, and if you are not a lazy executive you can walk to circular quay.The room was really well equipped, with plenty of space, the beds were also great.We were on the 4 floor and we noticed no nuisance from the monorail.The only negative point, was two lifts were out off order during two days.I would definitely recommend the hotel and I would return there.

<Content>Good location and value, but service is below average My wife and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Darling Harbor for a week, and overall it was certainly a decent hotel. Darling Harbor is a good location for tourist activities and the room rates at this hotel are reasonable for Sydney. It's my understanding that this particular Holiday Inn was recently rennovated. Our room was spaceous and well-appointed, with the only downside being the bathroom - which must not have been a high priority in the rennovation budget. But our bathroom were certainly bearable.The biggest weakness that we encountered here was the service. For example, their concierge desk didn't have much of a clue when it came to the most basic questions about Sydney. But then again, this is a Holiday Inn. So I was foolish to expect much. The other element that may disappoint you is the gym, which is in a dingy room behind the laundry facilities and doesn't have much in the way of equipment.If you're wanting to request a particular room I'd recommend asking for something on an upper floor facing the financial distict (George Street). The only potential problem that you might come across with room location might be facing directly into the monorail, which runs right next to this hotel and may give off some unwanted noise. Otherwise, you shouldn't be disappointed with this hotel. Especially if you come in with Holiday Inn-esque expectations...

<Content>Would stay again We stayed here for 5 nights from the 21st November and were very happy with it. We had only managed to book a smoking room but when we asked to change to non-smoking the staff were very helpful and took a lot of time to try to change our room. In the end, I think we got an upgrade as the room was pretty spacious and was on the top floor. We didn't hear any noise from the monorail but did have the airconditioning on so that may have masked the noise. The bathroom was a bit compact and the bed was far too soft, but for AUD$140 a night, we were pretty happy.The staff were very helpful. We arrived at midnight having not eaten dinner and they recommended a busy little restaurant to us in chinatown, literally a minute's walk away. As it turned out, we ate there many times during our stay, even for brekafast! It was cheap and cheerful and had excellent food, but maybe not everyone's taste of course. The staff also provided us with a universal adaptor as we had accidentally left ours in the last hotel.I'm not sure how easy it is to get to Circular Quay by public transport as we walked everywhere, but it was certainly no distance to Darling Harbour.

<Content>Very good hotel, great location. Very convenient location next to Darling Harbour. Very good standard bedrooms, well maintained. Room service was very good - they offer a wide range of menu items at reasonable prices - in particular they have a menu where the food is delivered quickly and in take-away style and with no service charge - great for kids especially.In-room Ethernet/Internet access plus public Internet access off the lobby. Very limited parking, and the nearby Entertainment Center carpark is a bit awkward to navigate to if you are new to the city.Breakfast buffet is very good - better than average, and the staff (especially in the restaurant) were exceptionally friendly.Only negative point is that the corridors (but not the bedrooms) have an odour - smells like damp.

<Content>Not bad but not great On the whole, not a bad hotel but not one I would go out of my way to stay at again.Location good - but more Chinatown than Darling Harbour. Don't expect any great views.Hotel a bit dated in places. Corridors bleak, bathroom furnishings worn. Rooms basic with small soft beds. Noise from adjacent room doors slamming was a significant problem - why can't they fit something to reduce this source of noise.Monorail audible right up to top floor where I stayed but not a nuisance. Lifts slow and housekeepinmg have an annoying habit of ringing you at 11am if you haven't vacated your room to ask if you want it serviced (or effectively to wake you up). Another annoyance was the hotel internet access, for which you can buy a card for $5. This is supposed to give you 25 mins of access, but if you use the card more than once, it debits an access charge and rounds minutes to the nearest five. In other words you get very little for your money and there are far better value Internet cafes within easy walking distance.In contrast to an otherwise mediocre stay, the reception staff I dealt with couldn't have been more helpful and are to be commended for their professionalism.

<Content>Very good hotel in convenient location I spent three days in Sidney and I stayed at the Holiday INN Darling Harbour (I was on holiday with my wife). The booking was made well in advance from the Holiday-INN internet web site. This allowed to obtain a great price for what you get (booking however is not refundable). Cost of the room was roughly 100 euro per day (excluding breakfast which is priced around 15 euro).Our room was at the sixth floor and it was silent. It was spacious, clean and with all the things you would expect staying at the Holiday INN.The position of the hotel is close to Darling Harbour and China Town. With a ten minute walk you arrive at Sidney Central Station (we went there to get the trains for the Blue Mountains), in a few minutes you can reach on foot George Street and get the buses that reach Circular Quay (Opera House). So I would say that the position is very convenient (I imagine that the hotels close to the Opera House are much more expansive).The monorail passes adjacent to the hotel but for us it was almost of no use and on the other hand the noise of the monorail was un-noticeable (staying at 6th floor).Reception could be a little bit crowded early in the morning but the staff was helpful and we did not experience any problem whatsoever. I would definitely recommend the hotel and I would return there.

But this story of mine just shows you the value of having really great people as part of your staff.Imagine this, you travel half way around the globe (am from Manila) check into your hotel and get set for a full day ahead of sight seeing, picture taking and all that other touristy stuff; but then you check on your digital camera and realize that you forgot to charge your battery. I checked on the sockets and it was NOT compatible with our parallel flat plugs here in the Philippines.Should be no problem right? Just call the reception and ask for an adaptor. I call and front desk and get a male on the line, I ask for an adaptor and lo and behold 鈥渨e鈥檙e sorry sir but we鈥檙e all out of adaptors, they鈥檝e all been borrowed.鈥?I tried to ask them to think of a solution for me, but it seems like the guy did not want to be bothered. I thought he was rather rude and the tone of his voice was rather peeved. Perhaps my accent wasn鈥檛 Caucasian enough for him to go the extra mile.I then put the phone down and called the GENERAL MANAGER, I called not so much to ask for help with an adaptor but also to call the attention of the hotel to the rudeness of their staff. Lo and behold, a Mr. Lachlan Graney picked up the phone and as the conversation went on, he identified himself as the SAME person that I had spoken to seconds before. I had suggested that the hotel buy some more adaptors because I really needed one that evening and did not want to brave the cold night outside to get one. His response was 鈥淚鈥檓 sorry sir, but we think we have enough adaptors.鈥?I then replied, 鈥渨ell, my not having one, doesn鈥檛 that tell you that you might not have enough?鈥?To cut a long story short, I went out that evening close to midnight and walked a couple of blocks and went through 4-5 convenience shops before I found my adaptor. Me and my wife were not just peeved by the whole situation but it kinda left a bad taste in the mouth to have to deal with hotel staff that aren鈥檛 just unhelpful but downright鈥ude.

<Content>What a find... My wife and I were very impressed with every aspect of this fine hotel...the staff were very helpful, we liked the central location and the moniorail, and especially enjoyed the excellent buffet breakfast.It was certainly good value for the money, and we would not hesitate to stay here again if we are ever privileged to be in this fine city in the future..

<Content>Fantastic value My family (2 children and husband) stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. It is a nice hotel ideally situated to darling harbour and china town and as many have stated within easy walking distance to the rocks etc. There is also a monorail station nearby. We were on the 8th floor and way from the noise of the monorail. To avoid that possible problem I would suggest a floor above level three. As the monorial does pass right close to level two and possible level three. Good pointsNice friendly and helpful staff at all times.The breakfast buffet provided ample choice for all tastes. A full buffet was 32 dollars per person or continental buffet was 22 dollars per person. Under 12's ate free with every paying adult.The airport shuttle was cheap at 9 dollars per head. Far cheaper than a taxi which costed us 55 dollars!Not so good pointsWe were charged for a call to a mobile phone! BUT that was rectified and removed from our bill. BUT do check your bill carefully. The meals in the restaurant were rather expensive.Housekeeping was very slow and we often did not have our room remade up till past 4pm which I feel is not good enough! When I mentioned this to a housekeeper he stated he's had over thirty rooms to clean by himself that morning. ???Short staffed.However on the whole this is a good hotel and i would recommend it to the budget conscious and those that want easy access to darling harbour.

<Content>Great hotel Stayed here for three nights last week, and was very impressed. When it comes to hotels, i always expect to get what I paid for, but this hotel performed consistently above expectations. The front desk staff were superb, and all other staff were friendly. Was welcomed by name as a PC member (even on the plasma TV by reception!) and upgraded to a corner suite, the sort of treatment I would expect as a top-tier elite, rather than the joe nobody that i am in terms of status!The location is good without being spectacular, but that again is what you would expect for the price. The real advantage is the availability of china town and its food just next door. From here I was able to walk everywhere I wanted within 20-30 minutes, including the rocksI would recommend this hotel for any traveller on a moderate budget

<Content>Great Place close to everything Stayed there end of March. The place is what you'd expect from a Holiday Inn: nice, clean rooms with all the basic needs. What is really outstanding though is its location. Having never been to Sydney before this is what initially drew me to this hotel, the location. Boy am I glad I chose it. You can walk everywhere, Darling Harbour for sure, Paddy's Market across the street, Market City as well. China Town literally behind the hotel. We walked all over, all the way to the Opera HOuse and Back, which can be a hike, but Sydney is so nice and so full of people in the streets, that walking all the way is a treat! The breakfast buffet at the hotel is pretty good, although its the same everyday....but then again, I wasn't there for the food! Great hotel, would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Location couldn't be better! We were there for 8 days in March. Hotel was fine, rooms were clean, staff very helpful. Location was awesome. Walking distance to Darling Harbor and all its attractions, Paddy's Market, Market City, Chinatown. We'd stay there again.

<Content>Three comfortable weeks at the Holiday Inn Darling Harbour We spent 3 weeks in January at this hotel for business/pleasure and were very pleased with the room and service we received. We splurged on a suite which made for a very comfortable stay. Only thing that really needed improvement was the fitness room. It is very small and the machines are in desperate need of updating. The suite could also use a microwave oven. Location is fantastic for getting around the CBD and Darling Harbour. Train system is maybe a 10 minute walk to Town Hall station. If you enjoy Asian food you will be in Heaven - Chinatown starts here.

<Content>Monorail close encounter At least one other reviewer moaned bitterly about the monorail but we though it was fun having a little train go right past our window - and not noisy to the point of being a nuisance! It doesn't operate between midnight and 7am. The hotel is apparently in an historic building although to me it looked pretty much like any other international hotel. Room was huge and clean. We got a very good internet deal.Darling Harbour is a pleasant if very touristy location and a bus ride or 20-minute walk away from the harbour bridge. When we visited, this was a Furama hotel with mainly Japanese staff and guests.

<Content>Excellent Location Stayed at the Hotel for 5 nights 10 January. A nice room, no noise at all from the monorail, staff very helpful. Just around the corner from Darling Harbour, Paddy's Market and China Town. Would recommend the ferry trip to Manly from circular quay and the bus to Bondi. A great place and would stay at the Holiday Inn again.
