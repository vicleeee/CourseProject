<Content>Good Choice! My spouse and visited New Orleans on Halloween. He had stayed at this hotel during the summer and said it was a good spot.We were greeted for the valet parking and quickly checked in. The room was very clean, had good furnishings, two comfortable queen beds with crisp linens. There was an in-room safe and complimentary computer wireless connection. The view of the parking lot was nothing spectacular, but it was quiet. In the back of the hotel lobby is a charming little courtyard. The hotel is close to the Riverwalk shopping area and the convention center and approximately a 30-minute walk to the French Quarter on relatively safe and interesting streets. Breakfast buffet was very reasonably priced with two different options: a great 鈥渉ealthy鈥?selection or a more elaborate hot selection. This is a very nice hotel and I can recommend it without hesitation.

<Content>Best Convention Center Location You have a many hotels that say they are near the Convention Center and even fewer that are nice. This property exceeded my expectations. Rack rate in June of $89. Like all HGi's there is a restaurant and small bar. The rooms are standard HGI, upgraded amenities and very comfortable beds. The property is a couple of blocks from the Convention Center, just far enough away from crowds. There are several restaurants you can walk too, French Quarter is $4 cab ride. The rooms are clean, excellent work station and fast internet.Highly recommend.

<Content>Pretty nice overall, but a few things should be addressed. Many good things and some areas of improvement needed. As an Honors member, they might have given me a room on a higher floor rather than a 2nd floor rooftop view almost expecting to see someone walking by my window any time. I appreciated the proximity to the convention center and it not being on a noisy street. The pillows and comforter were nice, but the ill-fitting sheet directly on a rather uncomfortable mattress left a little to be desired. The TV remote and radio didn't work, and an hour after I requested working ones, I called again and about 1/2 hr after that a guy came up with a remote and tried to fiddle with the radio and said he'd be back , but was doing house keeping and maintenance by himself. In a 5 day stay, I never did get a working radio. Another night housekeeping came by trying to push towels on me that they were sure I ordered (I had not. She finally apologized and left.) I appreciated having a fridge and microwave and the room was well furnished. I had one dirty towel upon arrival; one day they didn't change my bathmat and the next day gave me a stained towel for a bathmat. Another day they forgot to re-stock my coffee and gave me a generic brand of lotion instead of the advertised Neutrogena. Front desk staff don't tell you about the little water bottles they give out early afternoon or cookies, fruit and punch around dinner time, but nice perks! One day there was a host gentleman greeting people and he was a sweetheart. Front desk staff need to give better directions. I asked how to go to Riverwalk, a LARGE shopping and dining complex. Down a block and you'll see a sign. Uh, no. That would be walk THREE blocks to the Convention center, turn left and follow the length of it being several blocks long, then you will see a sign and walk a couple more blocks until you get to the place, which is several blocks long (but I recommend it!! Messina's has great food!) Pluses and minuses of the place. I'd call it Convention Center rather than Downtown I enjoyed my stay in New Orleans!

<Content>Great for Overnite to catch a cruise Great room for one night! We caught a cruise out of New Orleans. Location was very close to the Pier ($15.00 taxi fare), HOWEVER, the location of the hotel was odd. Located in a run down warehouse district. From a visitors point of view, it concerned me. The hotel offered a Cruise package for $71.00 a night provided you show them your cruise ticket. They also extended my check out time to 3p.m. upon requested. The front desk were accomodating, friendly and very helpful. Showed us where to go and told us where to eat. The room was nice, clean and comfortable bed. Shower was hot and the room stayed cold especially during the time we traveled, hot and humid (June 08)

<Content>Nice, Newer Hotel with a lesser price I stayed here for one night in March for a concert. The city was getting booked up fast so I got what I could. It turned out to be very nice inside. Very modern, comfy beds, flat screen tv, city view, and a very large room. I think we only paid $115 a night. The only downfall was that valet parking was $26 a night. You can find cheaper parking in New Orleans so it pissed me off that they charged this much.

<Content>A Nightmare When We Pulled Up It was the weekend before Mardi Gras, and my husband, baby boy and I pulled up to the front of the hotel late at night after a long road trip. As a former resident of New Orleans, I knew to ask the person who made the reservation whether or not there would be parking, and she assured me repeatedly that yes, there would be parking even though it was during Mardi Gras. But when we arrived, the valet people told us the garage was full and we were on our own. Of course there was no parking anywhere in the city, nearby hotels had reserved spaces for guests-only (as ours should have) and there was zero off-street parking for miles. Not only was there no place at all to put our car, when I went inside, the front desk worker started telling me about her own problems, that she had to park illegally and would probably get a ticket, and that I should know this during Mardi Gras. Finally, after hours sitting in front of the hotel, parked in the middle of the street with nowhere to go, the parking manager said he would make an exception for us and stacked us behind another car in the garage. He was wonderful--but I can't say the same about other staff members. I sent a formal complaint to the CEO of HIlton, and it was sent down the chain. The result--the manager of this property called me and told me that they sent letters to the guests in advance telling them there may not be spaces available. I NEVER received a letter. And while she said the staff members have been told not to complain about personal problems to guests, after I hung up, I still had a bad feeling about the property. I will say the rooms were clean, and we slept well (with the exception of an evacuation due to the fire alarm pulled by one of the guests at 2:00AM one morning.) Again, I understand that during Mardi Gras there are severe parking problems in the entire City of New Orleans, but the Hilton Garden Inn should not have guaranteed me a spot.

<Content>Nice stay close to convention center I stayed at the Garden Inn while attending a conference at the Convention Center in New Orleans. For this purpose, the location of the hotel is excellent - maybe a 3 minute walk to the convention center. You can also walk from here to the French Quarter, though that will take you 15 minutes or more. Other than the convention center, this part of town is pretty quiet...it's mostly other hotels in the neighborhood. There are several restaurants within a few blocks.Our room was in nice shape - everything was very clean and well-maintained. One big plus is that the rooms have a refrigerator and microwave -- nice for keeping those tasty New Orleans leftovers. The hotel also has free wireless internet. The breakfast in the lobby is a little overpriced, but that's to be expected with a hotel like this. There is a market in the lobby that sells snacks, drinks, etc. The staff at the front desk were always very kind and helpful.It isn't a luxurious hotel by any means, but it's a great place to stay near the convention center, and I would recommend it.

<Content>Good hotel in good location This is a good hotel in a good location in new orleans. It is about a 15 minute walk to the french quarter and is only about 5 minutes from the casino. Only stayed in hotel did not eat there so can't comment on that. Room was very big, bed comfortable, room and bathroom were spotless. Coffee making facilities and microwave provided in room. Good place to stay.

<Content>Well located, clean and at a reasonable price I was in New Orleans for business and the Garden Inn was a very convenient place to stay, located in the central business district. Parking was easy and I could walk to all my appointments. At the end of the day, I was able to walk to the French Quarter in under ten minutes. The rooms are large and well maintained, with wireless internet available. There is also an exercise facility and business center. A breakfast of eggs, sausages, biscuit, fruit and coffee was quite good and very inexpensive. The daily room rate was less than $100.

<Content>Great Packages! Very impressed with the friendly staff and ideal family packages that were available. FREE PARKING deal starts in May and I will take advantage of it. Present stay was over French Quarter festival weekend and prices were very reasonable, cab to the event was affordable. My room was nice and clean and quiet and cold when I returned to my room.

<Content>Be prepared We stayed a week at the Hilton Garden Inn hotel.We found the room very clean upon check-in and in good condition. The best feature of this property is the fact that it is one of the quietest hotels we've visited (good soundproofing between the walls, no door-slamming in the hallways). However.....We found quite a number of front desk employees (not all) to be rude and disinterested and housekeeping left much to be desired (one night they made up the bed without any fitted bottom sheet at all, one night they didn't even clean the room, and one night they didn't place any towels in the room).Valet parking is $20.00 per night but be careful because they will leave your car on the street for hours. Self parking is $15.00 per night but after 6PM you're lucky to find a space in the parking garage. Apparently, the hotel rents spaces for special event/concert parking and also allows patrons to a large bar beside the hotel (Metro Bar) to park in their parking facility (charging them, of course) so there are precious few parking spaces in the three story garage attached to the hotel.We were very pleased at the beginning of our stay but the longer we stayed the more problems we found and, quite frankly, we wouldn't go back primarily because of the rude front desk employees we encountered.

<Content>Acceptable but not Luxurious For the amount of money I paid for the room, I was expecting a little more than an up scale motel. If your looking for something clean and better than your average holiday in, than this is the hotel for you if your willing to fork up the extra money, but if your looking for fluffy down comforters and lots of pillows DON鈥橳 STAY HERE. There is a double tree a few blocks away.The staff was very friendly if you could actually find them. Maybe it was just Mardi Gras, but they were quite illusive, especially on the phone. Expect the phone to ring for a few minutes before you get an answer from the front desk.They have a restaurant, but it is outrageously expensive. $12.00 for breakfast seemed a little steep for me, and the food is NOT worth the money.If you are not an early riser don鈥檛 stay on the east side of the building, because the curtains are sheer and you will get a great view of the sunrise whether you like it or not. Also, housekeeping is particularly over zealous and will continually knock on your door from about 7:00am on.If you are going to New Orleans for an event at the convention center though, you couldn't find a better location. It is well within a very short walk from the hotel.

<Content>Not what I expected The hotel location was great for access to the convention center; however, it was quite a walk to the parade routes (went during Mardi Gras) and the French Quarter. There are plenty of reasonably priced restaurants within walking distance though I wouldn't recommend walking alone at night. Overall the hotel was very clean and the snack bar downstairs was a life saver, even if it is a bit pricey. The staff was friendly and helpful; when we could get their attention as it was very hard to get them on the phone, even from our room.  Since it was Mardi Gras, the parking situation was less than desirable. We had to park in a poorly designed parking garage in which the elevator was broken for $30 a day, the hotel refused to validate our parking but offered to refund us the difference between the garage and valet (approx. $8 a day). The beds were pretty hard and the walls were thin. Since we had a east facing room the sun came pouring in through the sheer curtains at around 6 every morning, which is about the same time that housekeeping decided to knock on our door (put the Do Not Disturb sign before you go to sleep). --Bottom Line--It was a decent hotel, but not what i expected from a Hilton, especially for the amount of money I paid. We will not stay at this location again.

<Content>Valet left my car on the street for 6 HOURS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The valet service left my car on the street for 6 HOURS!!!!!!! I was walking out of the hotel to meet my friend at the riverwalk for dinner and found that my car had been left on the street since I checked in over 6 hours ago!!!! I complained to the front desk and was told their was no room in the garage. I replied that their must have been room when I checked in over 6 hours ago. They were very rude and I don't know if my car ever made it to the garage, it was probably around the corner. The restaruant was so-so but overpriced for what it was. The rooms were nice and well furnished. This hotel had wind-only damage from Katrina, no flood damage.

<Content>GM's Son So Rude In The Lobby I have say this is a lovely hotel and we really enoyed our stay. The one thing that was a little disturbing was a guest was screaming in the lobby at the front desk and seemed to be out of control. We later found out this was the General Managers Son. Other than this incident we had a great time and will return when we can. What a very friendly staff!

<Content>Great stay at Hilton Garden Inn We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn April 9-12 for a brief vacation. The hotel and rooms were very clean and the staff quite helpful. We found a very cheap rate through the Hilton website ($84). It was about a 20 minute walk to the heart of the French Quarter, or a $6-8 cab ride. The hotel is located in the arts and warehouse district, home to many galleries and many great restaurant's including one of Emeril's and is an easy walk to the convention center. I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>We really enjoyed our stay We really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. The walk to the French Quarter wasn't bad at all. The front desk service was great and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was very good. The hotel also has a nice pool/spa and fitness center. We would definately stay here again when we return to New Orleans. The only thing that kept us from using it as a base for travel outside of New Orleans was the price of parking, which was pretty steep.

<Content>Newer Hotel with Friendly Staff Just back from a business trip and one night at the Hilton Garden Inn. This is one of the newer looking facilities and while it may be out of the way for party people, it is a few short blocks to the convention center and the River Center Mall, where they have everything you could imagine to eat in the food court...reasonably priced. I have stayed at other older hotels and felt this one was MUCH cleaner and up to date. I am a Hilton Gold Member, spending 75-80 nights per year in a hotel. I am also a very light sleeper and did not find the walls to be thin...perhaps because I was at the end of the hall? Previously, I stayed at the Radisson and could hear folks using the toilet and punching the buttons on their in room phone...those are thin walls!!! I walked ( while it was daylight) and did not feel unsafe. I would certainly stay here again, the staff was very friendly and the breakfast buffet was good...hot foods and fresh fruit, yogurt and pastries. I am not sure why someone else thought it was greasy...I did not!

<Content>Hilton? .... more like Holiday Inn The Hilton Garden Inn is fine if you're looking for a clean, good-sized room without much in the way of service or amenities. Also, it's very close to the Convention Center and [cheesey] Riverwalk. The issues would be: very bland rooms for a Hilton; the breakfast buffet will double your yearly grease intake; the toilets clog on a daily basis; and the hotel is not in a very nice part of town. As a matter of fact while walking back to the hotel at 10pm last night, a cop stopped my wife and I to make sure we knew we knew where we were going. He said, Be careful, the projects are only two blocks away and you shouldn't be on the streets at night around here. In summary: clean, large rooms... not much else going for it.

<Content>Fantastic!!! This was really nice. It was about a $5.00 cab ride to the quarter and not a bad walk if need be. It was a short walk to the Riverwalk Mall and a great place to stay if you are going to the Convention Center. The walls were somewhat thin but it didn't bother us much. The room was spacious enough for the both of us and I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>not great Bad location. Too far from the action, unless you don't mind taking cabs everywhere. The neighborhood was downright ulgy. It felt like a mile walk to the french quarter. Harrah's shuttle was terrible, so be prepared to walk. The hotel itself was clean, and nice looking. The room was clean and comfortable. The front desk people were nice. The restaurant in the hotel was really bad, service and food.

<Content>Will not stay here again..... I would not stay here again. There are many better hotels in the area. The food in the restaurant is bad and if you have any other problems with the hotel or its service, the manager will not even have the courtesy to speak with you. They are too busy. It has the worst customer service I have ever experienced..

<Content>You'll Like It Me and my husband stayed at this hotel. Its located in the warehouse district of New Orleans (a bunch of old empty warehouses attempting to be converted into stuff.) Its not a bad walking distance to Burbon St. and surrounding areas. Its two blocks from the riverwalk shopping areas and where the cruise ships port, maybe 4-5 blocks from Harrahs Casino. The staff was friendly and our room were clean and fresh. There is a resturant on the main floor were we had a buffet breaksfast (for a fee). There is room service doing certain hours, and a little convient store for the small things that may be needed or that were for gotten. I enjoyed my stay. Absolutely excellent location if your staying in the area to get on a cruise ship!

<Content>Exceptional Spot Wonderful hotel perfectly located in the super-fashionable Warehouse District. Great shops, galleries, restaurants, bars, and nightclubs abound, with gorgeous loft apartments on the floors above. Short walk to convention center, casino, French Quarter, or lower Garden District. Near St. Charles streetcar line. Friendly, accomodating staff, and new, immaculate rooms. Outstanding prices too.

<Content>Beware! This hotel has nice clean rooms and very comfortable beds. However, they have no one to help with luggage and they have limited carts that are hidden in rooms overnight by the savvy customers. The casino/French Quarter shuttle is a figment of their imagination. Just try and see one, let alone board one. If you stay here, bring a carry-in bag and be prepared to shell out money for a taxi. It's way too difficult to get your parked car, although the valet staff is excellent. Taxies are another matter. We took several, and all were really good and reasonable. I've stayed in equally nice hotels in the French Quarter and the Garden District for the same price. I may stay there again, but I'll shop around. I think that the Hilton Corporation is doing themselves a disservice to allowing their name on this hotel.

<Content>Location, Location, Location My boyfriend and I stayed at this Hotel for the Essence Festival July 2001 and July 2002. The accommodations were very nice and clean. The staff was friendly. Loved the walking distance to the Convention Center activities. A few blocks from Bourbon Street and French Quarter, but cabs came by day and night like clock-work. The restaurant did not seem very appealing, we never ate there either stay. I did notice that they keep increasing the rates every year for the festival, which is very dissapointing! We're going back to the Essence Festival this year, but won't be staying there because of the sharp increase in rates.

<Content>Very Nice! Nice, nice, nice. We stayed July 2002; it seems to be quite new. We (2 adults and daughters age 15  11) stayed in a room with 2 double beds and we had plenty of room. The furnishings are very attractive  comfortable  included a club chair  ottoman and a desk. There were enough mirrors near electrical outlets for 3 females to work on beautification simultaneously. The staff were always warm and helpful. We had the continental breakfast bar one morning which we didn't care to repeat. We didn't use the restaurant otherwise, so I can't speak to the made to order services. Our girls loved the fitness room  pool. We stayed in a no-smoking room on a floor entirely of no-smoking rooms which was very nice. It is a bit distant from the French Quarter but there was usually a taxi at the front door. We made the walk to the Quarter in about 20 minutes. It is very convenient to the convention center  riverwalk area. We had a great rate of $89/night which seems to be much lower than they usually charge. When I checked other dates I found rates to be $129-$149.
