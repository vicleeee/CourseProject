<Content>Closest to perfection We booked this hotel based on the reviews that were written and it is safe to say thatit did not disappoint. This was our second time in Bali and we wanted to experience somewheredifferent from the first which was in Nusa Dua. Stayed two nights each in Jimbaran, Kuta-Legian and for the final leg Komaneka Tanggayuda. We were glad that we saved the very best for last. Initially, we booked the pool villa for 2 nights. Fantastic hospitality from everyone, the reception, the drivers, the staff at the restaurants, basically everyone we met plus the beautiful villa enticed us to add an extra night. The hotel offers an array of activities if you would like to just stay in. There were so many to choose from, both complimentary and payable. We tried 2 of them, the Balinese cooking lesson, which was taught by the friendliest chef you could ever meet and the other being trekking. The scenery was breathtaking and even though it rained for a bit during our stay there, it did not dampen our spirits, if anything, the drizzles enhanced the serenity and created a romantic atmosphere.I would have given a six star rating if the lighting in the villa was better though. By far, the best hotel my husband and I have ever stayed in. We are aready planning our next trip to Komaneka Tanggayuda.

<Content>Only in Bali...only at Komaneka We stayed at Komaneka Tanggayuda for three nights in early November 2008. We stayed at the courtyard pool villa. The hotel looks new and is very well kept. The villas and facilities are spread out on a large beautiful property overlooking a valley. This setting gave us the impression that we were the only gests there, even though we were told they were almost full. The villa is splendid - beautiful lining, enormous stone bathtub, nice private plunge pool with day bed, complimentary tea and cakes served every day and a full set of amenities. The infinity swiming pool is stunning, right on the cliff overlooking the rice paddies. Because Komaneka Tanggayuda is about 15 min. from the center of Ubud, the place is very quiet and peaceful. The free shuttle to town is convenient and have flexible schedule. Wireless broadband in the bedroom worked perfectly.But the best part is the amazing hospitality and service. The staff found the perfect balance between being dicreet and friendly - more so than in any other place I've ever stayed in Bali (it was my 17th time in Bali). Highly recommended.

<Content>Excellent place We stayed at this hotel for 3 days and it had been a wonderful and excellent stay. The hotel itself is very nice with tranquil and serene environment. Although it would be a very good place for couples or honeymooners, they have been very accommodating in providing facilities, i.e. a baby cot and coffee/tea facilities for our 7-mth-old baby girl. The staff are very friendly and helpful; they even know our names when we went to the resto for our breakfast the next day! It made us very welcomed indeed....Our villa was facing the valley and we have our own privacy which we loved. We would definitely come back again to this hotel the next time we come to Bali.

<Content>Enjoyed the Komaneka Just back from staying for three days at the Komeneka at Tanggayuda and we throughly enjoyed our stay. We were staying in a valley pool villa and everything was perfect. We enjoyed our villa and pool plus afternoon tea with Bali Cakes delivered to our room each afternoon also our outdoor bathing experience. The staff were very friendly and helpful and overall we were very relaxed and didnt want to leave.

<Content>Great place for a Honeymoon, Bad Experience Stayed with my wife in Oct 2008. We were booked for two nights, but moved out after the first night. The hillside had been turned into a major construction site which not only completely spoiled the view but also created a lot of noise. I think the hotel might need to be closed for a few months till the construction in over. The main reason to stay here is the quiet surroundings and the view, after all. The staff was very nice and moved us to there other property on Monkey Forest Road, but it was kind of disruptive as we were in Ubud only for two days.

<Content>Excellent My wife and I booked 4 days at Komaneka Tanggayuda and ended up staying 2 weeks. Located just north of Ubud along a quiet river valley it has the advantage of being small (20 villas) so you are barely aware of other guests. The staff are excellent and try very hard to please. You can order anything from their menu and eat it anywhere from your room to one of the two restaurants to a secluded spot by the pool etc. Nothing is too much trouble for them. The food is light and well presented and worth staying in for.An hourly free shuttle goes in to Ubud and stops at several locations in Ubud including their sister property Komaneka at Monkey Forest Road. Its really convenient and means there is little need to rent a car or negotiate traffic.We upgraded from a suite room to a Valley Pool Villa which was well worth it. It had plenty of space, a large bathroom a private plunge pool and outside bale to lounge under. The decor is tasteful and the owner is the son of the founder of the reknowned Neka Art Museum which is a must see gallery with free admission to Komaneka guests.We are frequent visitors to Bali and in the Ubud area we have stayed in the past at Amandari, The Four Seasons Sayan, Alila, Pita Maha and Ananda Cottages and we felt that the Komaneka Tanggayuda was the best of all of them and deserved its top rating on Trip Advisor.Negatives? It should be mentioned that a new resort is planned for the opposite side of the valley which initially will spoil some views but will eventually blend in with plants etc. Work has begun but seems to have come to a halt because of the economic crisis. As we left, the new resort was putting in plants to shore up the hillside during the rainy season.

<Content>Exquisite beauty  We've just returned from 10 days in Ubud; 5 days at Komaneka Monkey Forest  5 days at Komenka Tanggayuda. Both hotels were superb  offered different experiences. Monkey Forest is in the heart of Ubud with the excellent Cafe Wayan literally just outside your doorstep; Tanggayuda offers beauty  serenity but away from the bustle of central Ubud. The hotel shuttle service gets you in  out of central Ubud in 15 min. We woke to the sunrise streaming through the palm trees. Lush gardens, gorgeous pool  beautiful villas; everything is so aesthetically enchanting. But best of all is the staff who made our stay truly memorable; we met so many lovely people who were incredibly warm, friendly  welcoming. A very special terima kasih banyak to Kande  Utami!

<Content>Highly Recommend Komaneka We had a really wonderful stay at the komaneka. The staff there are very special, they are so helpful without being intrusive, polite and will always remember you name!Our villa was superb in every way. The main pool was also very special, it feels like you are swimming in a big lake in the countryside! .We stayed for four nights in Ubud at the start of a nine day holiday in Bali. Ubud  Komaneka is the perfect start to a Bali holiday, you can wind down in truly tranquil spot. I would highly recommend Komaneka.

<Content>Elegant perfection This hotel is just amazing... simple, elegant, luxurious with exceptional customer service. For example, when you go to breakfast they ask for your room number. Why? So that they can clean your room when you're eating and have it ready for you by the time you're done! The rooms are gorgeous... spacious with every comfort considered. They have a simple but perfectly functional gym, which we used almost every day, and a beautiful infinity pool which was empty since almost everyone has their own plunge pool in their villa. The shuttle is hourly into town (about a 15 minute ride) but admittedly there were times where we had fleeting thoughts that the Monkey Forest Komenaka might have been more convenient. The spa too is tasteful and gorgeous but I do have to say that the massage itself wasn't as good as the ones I got at half the price in the main drag of Ubud. Otherwise this hotel is pretty much perfection.

<Content>Not recommended for families This hotel is NOT recommended for young families or families with babies. The rooms have a lot of sharp edges and don't have doors between the room and the bathrooms. (In fact, there are no doors except for the entry door! so if you don't mind lacking the privacy when you go to the toilet, then it's ok)The staff are very pleasant and most of them have an excellent understanding of English and are very knowledgeable of the area and the Balinese culture. Laundry is a RIPOFF!! Find somewhere in town to do it unless you don't mind spending $100 on 3 small bags of laundry.The restaurant food is lovely and not that expensive although of course it's always cheaper in town.They run a great free shuttle bus that has several drop off and pick up points in Ubud. The pool is freezing... so much for the idea of sitting around the pool and soaking up some sun.

<Content>Loved Komaneka at Tanggayuda My husband and I just returned from a 10 day trip to Bali - we spent 5 nights at Komaneka and loved it. Our villa was luxurious and modern, yet we still felt like we were in the jungle. The weather was a bit cooler than we expected, but the staff was incredibly friendly (including Kande!) and the spa was amazing (try the aromatherapy massage). If we are able to return to Bali, we will definitely return to Komaneka. Afternoon tea was also a treat!

<Content>Komaneka - Unforgettable Like the classic old song: Unforgettable, in many ways.... My hub and I are still mesmerised with our stay in Komaneka Tanggayuda since our return to Singapore on 25 July 2008. As this year marks our 15th wedding anniversary (24 July 2008, the actual day), I wanted to give my hub a memorable celebration and we were given the best memory of our days when we gave this all important task to the staff of Komaneka. We have no idea what they'll do on our special day and we were not a bit disappointed with their arrangement. Tea light candles were placed artistically in the restaurant (the restaurant was closed to the public for us). Soft music was played, an attentative, personal butler was provided, table was set romatically. The ambience was perfect for our candle light dinner. Our butler knew when to serve and chat with us, making sure that all things were well and comfortable for us and he also knew when to make room for just the two of us (my hub and I). We were so blessed with what was arranged and it was beyond our expectations. Our first impression of Komaneka Tanggayuda was like a gem sprouted among the padi fields and village. I was in awe when the chauffeur drove into the small lanes of the village houses and then, we landed into the property of K T. What a contrast of both world. Check-in was a breeze and all staff at the concierge greeted us warmly. We were escorted to our villa by the concierge and were given a brief tour of the resort. Our villa was beautiful and overlooked the padi field. We even have a private pool to ourselves. Born and live in Singapore, where traffic, pollution, crowds are visible, what we experienced in K T was peace, tranquality, fresh air, simple way of life. No hurry and anxiety. Shopping area was accessible from the resort and the shutter was made available FOC. Even though there is a time table for shutter service, but we were given the extra mile service. I've learnt that if you initiate to be friendly, you'll be rewarded much. If you are there, go for the trekking and sight seeing to the volcano. What an awesome sight and the tour guide will ensure that your trip is not in vain.Our 3 days 2 nights stay with K T was a memorable one and we have no negative views or complaints. Though we were the only Singaporeans residing at that time, we were treated no differently from the Japanese or Americans. The staff in K T have given us their utmost professionalism and service.Thank you to the service staff and the management of K T for imprinting a mark in our heart and memory.

<Content>My first review after many stays at Trip Advisor hotels I have stayed at many hotels after Trip Advisor recommendations but this is the first time I needed to comment and agree with all the great reviews. The hotel is wonderful so peaceful, but with all the facilities you would expect. However the thing that really makes this hotel so wonderful is the staff. They are fabulous and enjoy your holiday experience with you. Nothing is too much trouble. I really recommend

<Content>True Bliss Our three days at Komaneka Resort at Tanggayuda was really the highlight of our holiday in Bali. The staff were absolutely faultless and saw to it that my wife and I had a relaxing and fantastic break. Being 15 minutes outside of Ubud town, we escaped the busy and noisy hussle-bussle of motor-bikes, tourists, etc but when we wanted to visit the town, the shuttle service would deliver us and pick us up with no hassle. The shuttle-service ran every hour on the hour. Both my wife and I were so impressed with the professional service and ideallic setting we will definitely be returning. Thanks to all at Komaneka Resort at Tanggayuda.

<Content>Excellent Place! My husband and I stayed at the Komeneka for 4 nights for our 1-year anniversary. It was a terrific experience. We stayed in the Valley Pool Villa with private plunge pool, and the room was serene and gorgeous - pretty much everything I had wanted and expected from a luxurious and romantic stay in Bali. The main pool was dramatic, set in a cliff overlooking rice fields, and the grounds were meticulously manicured and cared for. We had several meals there, and the breakfast (included with the room rate) was scrumptious - and they serve it to you anywhere on the property. The best part about the Komeneka was the customer service. The staff was completely courteous and helpful, and they could serve to be a case study for the hospitality industry of what service should be. In particular, one of the staff members Kande practically had our daily itinerary in Ubud memorized, and was always happy to help with the myriad changes or adjustments to our plans. The always-smiling faces of the staff members was definitely one of the highlights of our trip.Be sure to also try their spa - it was beautiful, again with the outstanding customer service that defines this property. The Komeneka definitely exceeded all my expectations, and I would recommend it to everyone!

<Content>Tanggayuda vs. Monkey Forest We had a great stay at Komaneka Tanggayuda. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful. The rooms were beautiful. We stayed in a room that had a tiled outdoor area with a plunge pool, cabana, and outdoor bathtub. The resort has a beautiful view from the back terrace looking over a valley. They offered a good free shuttle service and multiple activities including free daily afternoon tea (tea plus various balinese snacks cooked in front of you), cooking class, guided hikes, etc. The whole place is also has free wireless internet.For those of you deciding whether to stay at Tanggayuda or Monkey Forest, I thought I'd briefly describe the differences. Komaneka Monkey Forest is the original resort. It is located off Monkey Forest Road which is the main road running through downtown area of Ubud. Therefore most of the shops and restaurants you will want to see are all in walking distance, including actual Monkey Forest. On the other hand Tanggayuda was opened about two years ago and is located about 15 minutes from central Ubud. It might seem far, but the hotel offers a free shuttle service that runs every hour between Tangayuda and Central Ubud, a nice drive past rice paddies and roadside shops. They will drop you off wherever you want and pick up as well. It also means that at Tanggayuda you stay away from the more crowded downtown near the Ayung River Valley where there are beautiful hikes and whitewater rafting. In fact, some of the other fanciest hotels (Four Seasons and Amandari) are off the same road as Komaneka Tanggayuda. Both places are great stays but hopefully this will help you make the decision between the two depending on your own preferences.

<Content>Heaven! For some trips already my girlfriend and I have used tripadvisor to select hotels and attractions and so we did with Komaneka at Tanggayuda. The summary is: we agree with most of the comments, the hotel in our opinion deserves a 5 star score.I麓ll try to be brief: Reservation process: We arranged everything by email directly with the hotel. All communications were clear and stated all we needed to know. We scheduled a car pickup from DPS airport at Bali and there was our driver waiting for us at 10PM on a rainy day.Airport-Hotel Shuttle: He drove us to the Hotel after a long trip (from Argentina it麓s about 24 hours flight + stops). The drive to Tanggayuda takes about 70-90 minutes from the airport. Driving in Bali is not easy if you come from a developed country.Arrival:A lady greeted us in the reception and we were driven with a golf cart to our room (pouring rain), a private villa with pool, number 106 to be more precise. We could not believe our eyes. Room: Yes, we are not used to paying USD 250 (net including all taxes and fees, breakfast, tea, etc) per night. But the room was much more than what the photos show. Generous in size, a great bed (or had we travelled so much that we needed an incredible bed...), the bathroom was enormous, the toiletries were adequate, the shower was hot. The outside pool was fantastic, the varanda sooo relaxing. In short, the room was what we had expected and more. I think the location of the room within the hotel is also very good since it is very near the large incredible pool that the resort has, so the view and location is convenient, although it may be a bit far for elderly people or those with walking problems (maybe 50 meters away in a slope). The A/C in the room was adequate and the cookies that they left every day, a delicacy. The Wi-Fi internet connection was not great, slow and sometimes on/off, so we could not rely on Skype to make our calls. This is something minor (in our opinion) that should be amended.Another positive point is the staff. All incredibly friendly, calling us by our names, smiles on their faces all the time, attentive, ready to answer any question, we could not ask for a better staff.The gym was also adequate with a very modern treadmill and bike (all I use is that), so in my opinion, quite complete.To sum up: I would say that the outdoor pool is magnificent, the views from there are amazing, the premises are great, the staff is very courteous and the owner has done a magnficent job. Our driver has been working for the hotel for 7+ years as have some of the staff that served our breakfast. I understand that this is definetely good.On top of the reception is a very cozy library full of Bali books, guides, photo books and place to relax and read. You will also find a computer there where internet seems to work faster.There is nothing we disliked from the hotel, we fully recommend it, we would definetely come again and we are really happy we made this choice. After this hotel, we spent 2 days in Alam Gili in the incredible island of Gili Trawangan and 2 more days in Alam Jiwa. I will try to write reviews of these places soon.

<Author>Notoriety
<Content>Faultless I struggle to find any criticism of this hotel and can only endorse the other reviews. The staff were as welcoming and helpful as you could want and it lived up to the manager's aim to create a family relationship between staff and guests. The valley pool villas overlooked the steep gorge to rice paddies and came with their own infinity plunge pools.I've never stayed anywhere where they lay out his and her nighties every evening.The food was just OK (in common with all the hotels I stayed at in Indonesia). But they did give us a free cooking lesson in the hotel kitchens and the romantic red light dinner was wonderfully over the top; filling the villa pool with unfeasibly large numbers of flowers and candle lights. Had some great food at Ary's Warung in Ubud and would have liked to explore the local food scene more.The hotel is quite a way north of Ubud centre; far too far to walk or even cycle. But it is very peaceful there. Hiring a bike lets you explore the little villages that pepper the countryside, though it can be tough traversing the steep valleys that cut north-south around Ubud.

<Content>Slice of Paradise What started out as a five day holiday at this amazing resort stretched to a week and a half at the expense of further travelling in Bali. No sacrifice here, we loved it!!!! My partner, myself and our 4 year old were treated like family and no request was too much. The staff make you feel so comfortable and we were sad to leave. Our villa was gorgeous! Spacious rooms and so comfortable. Did I mention our private plunge pool and kabana? The resort itself is stunning in its natural surrounding and also beautifully manicured within the grounds. We definately recommend a holiday here and we will be coming back. Thankyou to all the staff for making our holiday at Komaneka a forever memorable one.

<Content>Fantastic Escape! As most reviews on this site indicated this is a truly fantastic resort. Spent three nights here in April as part of a 10 day trip to Bali. Began the trip in Nusa Dua taking in the touristy part of the island and the trip to Ubud was such a great experience. The resort, staff and grounds are just fantastic. The resort's food service was great, surprisingly large selection to choose from and very nicely put together... we enjoyed it so much we ate in our room every night, highly recommend the candle light villa dinner.. room is set up with candles/flowers and a multi-course meal is brought to your outdoor bed... The spa services at the resort were also very good and very reasonably priced.One thing to note;There are two Komaneka's in Ubud.. i was a bit confused by this when booking and was initially disappointed I wasn't able to get in to the Monkey Forest Road location. Not to worry, the Komaneka at Tanggayuda has a very easy to use hotel shuttle which makes the quick run to Monkey Forest Road every hour and is easy to get to and from... After making the trip to visit the central market there and shops on Monkey Forest Road I determined I hadn't missed out on anything... our return shuttle picked us up from the Monkey Forest Road Komaneka so we got to take a brief look at the Komaneka there as well

<Content>Our Family in Ubud Words will never be able to express our stay at Komaneka!!!It was our honeymoon and Komaneka was a suprise for my new bride as I did not tell her where I was taking her.I made my reservation approx. 6 months prior to check in and I planned my entire stay of 4D3N via telephone with Mr. Surya (Operations Manager). It's probably the best decision I made as there were quite a few choices for hotels in Ubud, but I decided to choose Komaneka simply because I was impressed with the way I was I was handled on each phone call to the resort and how helpful Mr. Surya was. After talking to one another over the phone for months prior to check in, we became more of family than friends. He assisted me in almost everything I wanted for my honeymoon and planned some designed a package that was perfect for honeymooners.Right from the Airport Pickup / Clearance to baggage transfers was a breeze as Surya had already arranged the neccesary for a smooth transistion.My true happiness set in when the doors opened to my Valley Pool Villa which was nestled privately right at the edge of the Ayung River and to see the glitter in the eyes of my wife is something I will never forget. At that very moment, I already knew that I made the right choice.The room was clean, smelled like fresh flowers, the bathroom was heaven in its own was and so spacious and complete.Everything was thought of and the amenaties were well thought off. Apart from being given a breathtaking room to stay, the level of service and hospitality from the staffs were no lesser. Right from the hotel driver, Guest Service Officer, Security Guards to the masseurs at the spa to the waiters at the restaurants had only one mission in their minds. TO GO THE EXTRA MILE JUST TO MAKE THE GUEST HAPPY!And for my wife who's an animal lover , she kept talking about Chelsea which was a pure bred German Sheppard which turned out to be more of a darling pet instead of a fierce security guard.On the third day of our tour, our driver Koman Suandiaka took us to the botanical garders for a picnic lunch and it was probably the best experience ever.The Chef had cooked some of his best dishes and it was all packged neatly into our hotel provided MPV and complete with drinks, fresh fruits, hand  face towels etc. etc. We made sure to have Koman (hotel driver and tour guide) to eat with us together as he was too pleasant and humble and he was like more of a brother to the both of us!!Komaneka is one of those hotels that you will remember for a lifetime because of it's people, level of service and excellent food. I've made my promises to them and YES, we will want to go back there again for a second honeymoon......Thanks to Surya and team for making our honeymoon meaningful and complete!!!

<Content>Most incredible Stay After many hours of searching for hotels to stay in Ubud, we finally decided on this resort. We were so happy with our decision. My husband and I absolutely loved staying here and cannot wait to go back. It is about a 15 minute drive into town but the shuttle from the hotel leaves every hour and runs until pretty late in the evening. Ubud pretty much shuts down at 10pm so we didn't feel like we were missing anything in town. We heard from other guests at different resorts that their hotel shuttles did not run as frequent or as late. The staff were so friendly and gracious. They all knew our names and made sure we were taken care of. Our room was beautiful. The food was amazing. They have a small fine art museum in the resort. The resort owner is a very influential art collector. He also has a famous art museum down the street with his personal art collection. It was impressive and worth seeing. If you are considering this hotel , you will not be disappointed. We had a great experience and look forward to visiting again. The only thing that can be improved is computer and internet access. There is only one computer in the library with slow internet. We used it a few times to communicate with friends and family but it definitely needs some updating.We had a driver. He was very honest and a good man. we made arrangements with him beforehand. If you are looking for a good driver. his name is Rocky . You can email him directly at [--]. He will remember us by this hotel.

<Content>Beautiful for honeymoon!!! It's impossible to overstate what a wonderful experience this was. Something I hadn't appreciated from reading other reviews was how much you feel a part of nature here; the lovely landscaping, with flowers and fruits growing up all around you, the voices of the frogs and geckoes, the views of the valley. It doesn't feel like a hotel at all. For the second part of our stay we stayed at a more expensive place by the beach and were sorely disappointed. Also, the staff were incredibly nice and helpful. Occasionally we had some miscommunications, but as long as we repeated what we wanted they were always happy to help. The restaurant and room service are both great. The villas are designed so that you have floor-to-ceiling windows all around and great views, but also walls for privacy. There's a convenient shuttle service for town, which is actually quite flexible and can sometimes drop you off exactly where you want to go. I would go back to stay again right away, if we only had the time and money!

<Content>Great Spot We stayed here for 4 nights during the beginning of our honeymoon, and it was a great place to start. Super friendly staff, great service and beautiful grounds. The free transit into town was definitely a plus. Our A/C broke the 2nd night we were there, so the management upgraded us to the highest end villa they had - that was great. We never actually ate at the restaurant onsite except for breakfast, so I can't comment on that. However, the breakfasts were pretty good - great muesli and yogurt. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Special Place Really enjoyed the location in the tropical rainforest. and is a distinct contrast to a few days in Kuta or Seminyak. We had a pool villa overlooking valley and really impressive. Villa was great. Great Staff. Meals pretty good and plenty of good restaurants nearby accessed by free shuttle. Moziac, Indus etc.We would go back again anytime.

<Content>Absolutely Wonderful!! We took the honeymoon package that the hotel crafted. AT US$845... it was definitely worth every cent... =)There are so many note-worthy elements... 1) Excellent Service... very friendly staff2) Attention to details (they even caught the gekko that was in our room when we were out for a few hours) 3) Good food preparation... home made raisin cookies in your rooms... they replenish the jar everyday! 4) Daily tea for guests5) Line-up of Activities (some free)6) Our package came with VVIP pick-up from the airport... absolute breeze to clear customs... moment we stepped off the plane, we went straight to baggage claim while the guide cleared immigration with our passports (including getting visas)We even went away with gifts... little things add up and we have already been recommending the hotel to our friends... perfect place to chill-out and rest to take mind off the hectic city life!

<Content>Wonderful, Exquisite, Perfect... I travel extensively but have never been compelled to write a hotel review...before now. During a 12 day trip to Bali, my boyfriend and I stayed at the Komaneka Resort at Tanggayuda from 21-25 February. This resort is exquisite and the staff is extremely warm, charming, and helpful. It would behoove you to stay here if you want a relaxing, romantic vacation.I am accustomed to staying in luxury hotels when I travel (eg: Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, boutique hotels) and Komaneka at T is right up there. The hotel is beautiful and tastefully interweaves Balinese culture, art, and nature throughout the hotel. The pool villa (106) was amazing and lived up to the expectations based on the other tripadvisor reviews--spacious, wonderful plunge pool, spectacular view of rice paddies across the valley, and relaxing outdoor bale. We loved that the hotel accommodates for every possible request/desire before you have to ask: complimentary bottled water, cookies, bug spray, umbrellas, shopping tote already in the room; bedtime stories, and nightgowns at turn down service; extensive and creative breakfast menus and afternoon tea. This hotel also has numerous activities scheduled that guests can attend, if desired: yoga, Balinese appetizer preparation course, woodcarving class, etc. The spa is also great--perfect pressure for massages. You arrive and the spa takes care of everything--bathing suits to jacuzzi in after your massage, safes for your belongings, etc..The duck dinner was also yummy and beautiful. I loved how they covered our pool with flowers and floating candles and lit tons of candles around our courtyard.This hotel is about 15 minutes outside of central Ubud and we loved that it was amidst a little village with rice paddies surrounding. There are frequent daily shuttles into Ubud where the drivers will drop you off where you want to go, so transportation was never an issue. Moreover, the convenience of being able to enjoy afternoon tea or swim at the other Komaneka property at Monkey Forest (in Ubud) while waiting for the hotel shuttle or when we needed a shopping break was something we enjoyed.We were very pampered by the hotel's staff. The staff is extremely warm, always greeted us by name, and took time to ensure that our needs were well met. Actually, when we off-handedly suggested that one of their staff (Budy) come with us on two days of touring, they adjusted his work schedule so that he could accompany us! We had the best time seeing the sights of Bali with Budy and Eric (our driver)! They were great tourguides, informative sources of Balinese culture and practices, kept hawkers at sights from swarming us, and ensured that we were not charged excessively. They also made sure that the car was stocked with fresh cold towels, drinks that we liked, cookies, ipod music that we liked, and sarongs and sashes that were necessary to wear in order to enter temples. Ask for Budy and Eric--we loved them! On our last day, Eric took us to the airport and Budy changed his work schedule to be able to say goodbye to us. Overall, we were enchanted by Bali and we absolutely loved this hotel.

<Content>Wedding to remember My husband and I had our wedding and honeymoon at the Komaneka Resort. Although we were eloping and it was just the two of us, we still had a service and a few extra people there to witness our day. It was incredibly beautiful and romantic. The staff and management made sure that everything was perfect and that we were all set. Of course, the two hours at the exquisite spa before our wedding helped ease of nerves, too.We stayed in a Villa with a pool. Again, everything was wonderful. Clean, comfortable, and luxurious without going over the top. The food was always fresh and tasty. Room serve was timely and well-organized.Since this resort is just outside of the main area of Ubud, they maintained a good transport service into Ubud. But you also had plenty to do at the resort, especially if you were there to relax. A great pool and cafe were the main attraction for relaxation. Every night there was a cultural dance or something to enjoy. Further, the rooms were comfortable enough that you could enjoy a rainy day inside, too.Because we booked from the internet, we were given a special rate and then we were able to negotiate with the hotel regarding the wedding and a very special dinner, among other things. Roughly, the villa for 3 nights, basic wedding costs, and a wonderful romantic dinner came to about $225.00/night (excluding taxes). There were other costs, but those were incidentals, etc. The Spa treatments were among the best I have ever had, and I travel extensively to find the best treatments. They were expensive, but worth it.While we do feel we got a great deal, it was the people at the resort that made the difference. Every member of Komaneka wanted to make sure that our wedding was the best ever. There is no doubt that we will return as often as possible and will continue to give this hotel a very high recommendation. The people and place are the best!

<Content>Komeneka resort at Tanggayuda - wonderful experience We just returned from our 9 day trip to Bali. We spent 3 nights at Komaneka Resort at Tanggayuda. Our stay was wonderful. The villas are secluded and very romantic. You really feel like you are in the middle of the jungle when you are in your villa. The staff was super friendly and went out of their way to cater to our needs. During our stay in Ubud we went white water rafting, hiked Mt. Batur, shopped in Ubud, went to the Monkey forest and relaxed at the Komaneka resort. The resort had a beautiful infinity pool, room service, free internet.

<Content>Problem At Komaneka The hotel is lovely and is 15 minutes outside of Bali. My complaint is not with the staff as they were friendly and helpful, but with the management. We decide after four days to change our hotel and get closer into town. The hotel was given a two day notice that we would be leaving earlier than originally scheduled.The hotel was one fourth full.We were charged $200 for leaving early. I would understand this policy if the hotel was full, but not with it empty. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone due to this incident. It unfortunate that this beautiful hotel has such a greedy management.marlene

<Content>Would return in a heartbeat We spent three wonderful days at the Komaneka over Thanksgiving '07, and I can't wait to return. Although I booked a standard suite room, we were upgraded very unexpectedly at check in to a valley view pool villa, and wow, was it nice. Having our own plunge pool was the best part of the stay - we were in the pool 3-4 times a day, and it was a great way to cool down after a hot and dusty excursion to town. Loved the outdoor bathtub and the comfortable room and bed - plus the fact that once you walk in your compound and shut the door you are completely shut off from the world. the outdoor bale is a great place to read or nap, and the room feels almost outdoors with the glass walls all around. A great impression of being in the middle of nowhere and total privacy. The friendly staff will do anything you ask, but do know that it will happen slowly. That's ok, though, because part of the pleasure of Bali is the pace.The hotel is far from Ubud, but it isn't a significant problem if, like us, you were relaxing rather than strenuously touring or shopping. The hotel has a shuttle that runs all day, typically 10-15 minutes behind schedule ;-) We had the special candlelight smoked duck dinner at the main pool and it was good food and well worth the splurge to have the flowers and hundreds of floating candles and flowers. What a treat! We also booked a rice paddy walk via the hotel which we totally enjoyed - reasonable prices and really knowledgeable guide. I suspect that their other excursions are similarly worthwhile, and reasonable. I also had two very nice massages while there - the spa facilities are smallish but very pleasant.We're reccomending Komaneka to everyone we know -- and plan to return ourselves. Oh, and if you are dithering over the price for the pool rooms - just do it. I will next time, the privacy of your own pool can't be beat.

<Content>A place to return to My boyfriend and I recently escaped for a week-long break to Ubud and for the second time this year we chose to stay at the Komaneka Tanggayuda. We had stayed there in June and had such a wonderful, relaxing time that we decided to return again six months later.We chose the Komaneka because unlike many of the other high-end properties in Ubud it is a genuine Balinese experience. The staff are all from Ubud and surrounding areas -- in fact, many are from the village of Tanggayuda -- and are wonderfully friendly and very thoughtful and helpful. The owner of the resort is also from Ubud and well-known as an art collector and art dealer.The villas are very spacious and let in a lot of natural light, with gorgeous views of the valley and padi fields. They are elegantly furnished, with a relaxed, comfortable feel, instead of an overly-hip or business-like hotel feel. The villas also have a lovely and very private outdoor area, with your own plunge pool and outdoor seating area. I also appreciated the good reading material in the villa -- books and magazines on Ubud, as well as the well-stocked library with lots of books on Balinese art and design.We enjoyed going to the spa for an excellent Balinese massage. The spa is fairly-priced, and the upstairs section has great views. We also enjoyed having a tasty bowl of bubur ayam in the morning, and recommend the Indonesian food in the restaurant, especially the duck. There is also afternoon tea served everyday by the pool, with lots of tasty treats and iced tea and coffee.The staff were also helpful in making arrangements for us to rent a motorbike, which we rode up to the lakes around Bedegul, which was beautiful, especially the out-of-the-way villages along the way. We also had dinner at Mozaic, which must be the best French food in Southeast Asia and very nicely priced, and lots of martinis at Naughty Nuri's, a great hangout where you are guaranteed to meet some interesting characters.Bottomline is: Highly recommended for a great break. Felt very re-charged and relaxed after a week here. There is another Komaneka property on Monkey Forest Road near the centre of Ubud which has a similar look to this place, but we preferred the Tanggayuda because it is more secluded and retreat-like.

<Content>A real dreamland !! We love this villa!! Everyone there was sincerely very helpful and nice. At the same time , they know very well how to leave the privacy to the guests.It is a very quite, clean villa. Also, it smelled very nice, they had flower in many paces. However, my husband, who has a terrible flower allergy, was as normal as me !Their breakfast was great, you can try their Indonesia style breakfast. I was happy everytime when I orderd it !!There are too many good things to tell, even a nice picture can't show totally how wonderful this place is. Let me finish with one of my picky husband's words:  Finally, I've found a place in this world where I can come whenever I need a real vacation.We'll go back !!

<Content>Amazing hideaway Spent 3 days of our honeymoon here as recommended by a friend.A very relaxing hideaway, 20 mins in a car from Ubud.It has a very welcoming, family, cosy atmosphere with great service.The room we had was amazing (Valley Pool Villa). Very spacious, glass walls all around, nice plunge pool with view and a very comfortable outside day bed that is shaded from the sun.The food is of a very high standard and restaurant is in a relaxing, pretty setting.Every day they organise activities (yoga/walking etc) that are on the whole free.The gym only has a few machines, but is spacious and again with clear glass windows surrounding it.We stayed in Maya Ubud, but I got a much better feel for this place because of the above.We checked out their sister hotel in Ubud Centre, excellent location for bars/restaurants/shopping but missed the hideaway feel of Tanggayuda.I checked out A LOT of reviews for my honeymoon, and this is right up there and, for the cost, has to be one of the top spots in Bali.

<Content>People Power..! Great place,great Food with the great People. View is nice, room facility as well, but I think other place also have this point. It just so homey feeling attached in the place. I think the niche is really on their people. They use Balinese as their front liner staff (I just like it), and u almost see same people handle U from time to time. It comforts me. Oh, their people also like 鈥淏ali Traveling Dictionary鈥?(don鈥檛 compare with Jessica Alba in sleeping dictionary :p) , looks like the management already acknowledged them with the guest need so they can give you any information. Mmm..but the wifi is quite limited (come on, even in holiday I still need to check something). Definitely will be back to this place but of course..next time without my鈥漦eep talking鈥?cute daughter (prefer for couple I guess).

<Content>We'll be back I do not usually write reviews but feel that I ought to as I found this place through one of the reviews on Trip Advisor. We had decided that we would celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary in Bali at the Conrad Resort where we were in March this year when our daughter was married there. We thought we'dtake in Ubud and, not having been there before, used Trip Advisor as our starting point. Are we glad that we did. From the time I first contacted the Komaneka Reservations, I was impressed with the efficient and prompt service. The Komaneka at Tanggayuda is set in beautiful grounds and very low key. It is not a glitzy resort with smoking mirrors. It is very private and you only ever see the other guests at breakfast and whilst waiting for the shuttle. We had a private villa (as they all are) overlooking a valley. The staff, under the management of Surya, the Resort Manager, was friendly and eager to please. They went out of their way to ensure that our visit would b! e a memorable one. We were particularly grateful that he helped sort out our foreign exchange problem and this is something which many visitors to Bali may not be aware of . If you are bringing US$ make sure the notes (we had $100notes) are not pre 2003 notes even though they may be crisp and new as mine were - they won't be accepted by most money changers, hotels and restaurants - so bewarned. Eventually we found a bank which would accept it but only because it had the machine to verrify it's authenticity. Apparently pre 2003 US$ notes are easy to counterfeit. Anyway Surya helped us resolve the problem. that aside,we thoroughly enjoyed our 4 days atthe Komaneka Tanggayuda we cannot reccommend the place more highly. We definitely will be back !

<Content>A great base in Ubud. My wife and I recently completed a four night stay at this property. It is an excellent base to explore Ubud.When we checked in we were brought to our beautiful villa with our own private plunge pool. As we were there for our honeymoon, they also filled the bathtub with flowers. It was a very nice gesture but when we checked in the water in the tub was freezing cold.As other reviewers mentioned, the hotel is about 15 minutes from downtown Ubud. The shuttle service the hotel offers to downtown is very convienient as it leaves every hour. However, using it to bring you back to the hotel is not as easy. Although they have a schedule of pick up times, they always tried to push me to give them a set time when I wanted to be picked up. This was a little annoying as we wanted to spend the evening in town and weren't sure how long we wished to look around for.Our room came with an American breakfast which wasn't that great. The one night we ordered room service for dinner though was excellent.My only other complaint was the plunge pool. The water was freezing! It was so cold we were never able to use it, which made it not worth it to pay for it. You would imagine for what a Villa costs they would at least slightly heat the pools.Other than that the hotel is wonderful. The grounds are perfect, the rooms offer picture perfect views, and the staff is very, very attentive. I became ill when I was there from a meal I ate (whatever you do, do not go on the Bali Hi Dinner Cruise). When I called the front desk they said they could call a doctor who wold visit me in my villa. It made my trip a whole lot better.Overall, if you're looking for a quite, beautiful place to stay in Ubud, this is well worth it.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay at the Komaneka We found the Komaneka Resort at Tanggayuda an excellent place to start our Bali holiday. The service was exceptional; nothing was too much trouble for the staff to organise, which persisted even after we had left when we re-contacted the hotel to find out where to find/buy the special little lamps they use to light their gardens. Efficient spa, lovely infinity pool on the edge of the jungle and the gardens were particularly lovely at night. It didn't bother us at all that the resort was 15 mins drive out of town as there was transport organised to leave from the hotel/pick up from the town or market almost every hour.Breakfasts were excellent; our only quibble was with the evening meal where the menu seemed somewhat restrictive, but with so many other places to eat in Ubud, that's not really a negative.

<Content>Complete Relaxation We have our Honeymoon there and it was a great decision that we'll never regret. We're very well-treated from the very first moment we got on the shuttle at the airport. The second thing was the resort itself when we arrived. Tranquil, peaceful, authentic and we just couldn't have enough to say about it. The whole thing is just like a huge piece of art! Then was the villa which is so beautiful and strategically placed overseeing the valley. We're staying at the valley pool villa, which was specially arranged for honeymoon couple, has got everything that you need to revitalise. The other that impressed and surprised us was the high-tea that was being set up on the grass and under the trees. When I didn't feel like going out, I'd go to the library to read and to listen to some music and you could even borrow them. Food is good and service is excellent and one thing to stress is that you could have your meal served at everywhere you like, be it in the villa, by the pool or at the terrace. All this made us feel so well taken care of and exclusive. It indeed worths more than what we have paid for and we definitely feel like making a come-back.LaiMevis

<Content>Perfect place to stay! My sister and I recently stayed at a Pool Villa at the Komaneka at Tanggayuda and we loved it. It's about 15 mins from Ubud, but that was a real bonus as it was incredibly peaceful with fab views of the lush valley. We visited the Komaneka in Ubud in Monkey Forest and though it was nice too, the one at T was so much more pleasant with large open spaces and had a lovely tranquil atmosphere. It was also very cool and breezy.The staff were lovely and facilities great. DVD player in room and you can borrow movies, though we brought our own to watch. I would highly recommend the Komaneka at Tanggayuda. Brilliant... will def go back.

<Content>Unforgetable honeymoon experience at Komaneka Tangayuda Hotel We were received by a delightful staff with warm, aromatic washclothes, we were then escorted to our honey moon suite where there was a warm bath with flowers shaped as a heart.In our room there were assorted cookies, a fruit plate with exotic fruits of the area including mangosteem and snake skin fruit among others. We also received a delicious fruity cocktail.Our bed also had flowers and two cotton robes waiting for us, and this is besides the terry bath robes and slippers.The service was helpful and kind throughout our stay, and generous as well. There was no request of ours that was not fulfilled.The view of our room was delightful, as we were looking out to an endless private pool that overlooked the rice fields...The experience was sensuous and delicious to say the least, and the feeling was that of home. It was not pretentious or snobby, but all the opposite: friendly, warm and down to earth..We loved every minute of it....

<Content>The best place in Ubud Just come back from Komaneka on June 2. It's really a great place to stay. Very quiet and relax. The staff are excellent and greeted to us with our last name every day - with smile. we stayed in Valley Pool villa room 103~105. Room 105 has the best view. The resort manager Surya is a nice person. I suggest to book the room with Komaneka directly.Spa / yoga......many activity to go with during my stay. I recommend a pay tour - Trekking becasue you will see a very famous art village and astonish view. I will surely come back.

<Content>Great holiday! We had one of the best holidays in our life at the Komaneka! Great looking property, fabulous rooms and really friendly staff. Everyone greets you by first name through the entire stay. Went there with our 9 month old and the staff at breakfast would be more than happy to carry him and feed him fruit while me and my husband ate.....truly unexpected! My only grouse is that, like a previous reviewer says, after a day or two housekeeping tends to slip. By day 3 we had bins overflowing with dirty diapers that had not been cleaned - although clearly the rest of the room had been. Very thoughtfully they had provided a baby cot but the netting smelt mouldy. Location is a bit of a problem ... there is little to do after dark and the restaurant dinner is not that nice either (compared to the gems in Ubud town). But all in all a really peaceful retreat. Beautiful and quiet. A great way to see Ubud. We got a really good deal by getting in touch with the property directly, so would recommend that.

<Content>Beauty at its best This resort hotel is breath-taking. In a beautiful location, the rooms are gorgeous, the staff warm, friendly and helpful and the atmosphere makes you want to stay. It's worth getting a Pool Villa and luxuriating in the Spa with a massage. One night would not be enough- I don't want to leave after 5.

<Content>~ one heavenly nite ~ One simple comment for our recent stay-experience at Komaneka Tanggayuda: EXCELLENT!!! From the minute we arrived, during the stay and check-out time... everything was so perfect! The service was so precise and the staff were so friendly and warm...The Valley Pool Villa is stunning! We really enjoyed the room and loved the bathtub!!! :)Nite time was so romantic, we must say...that jazz lounge CD had beenour bestfriend all nite long...made the nite even sweeter! When morning came... time for some sunshine... my partner was enjoying himself in the pool while I did my sun-bathe... what a perfect weekend getaway! Breakfast was served in the villa and the food was sooo delish! You could never ask for more...One thing that we never thought about before, is that your car is also being taken care of!!! They washed and cleaned your car, with a small surprise of those small mineral water put in your car. Yet, the small unique spa gift upon check-out.It was really a great experience and excellent service given!

<Content>Happy Vacation First of all, if someone ask us whether we would like to return the Komaneka Resort at Tanggayuda again, of course, our answer is YES! Without doubt the friendliest and most helpful people in Ubud are the staff at the Komaneka Resort at Tanggayuda.We couldn't have asked for better service - booking a shuttle bus to the town, making afternoon tea at the pool side, recommending restaurants etc. All the staff are friendly and very kind, their hospitality made us relax and happy. The villa is clean and sophisticated.We enjoyed the nature from the window and the bird talk in the morning.There is no premium to pay for breakfast in your room. (We would like to try it next time.)This is a special place to stay. We plan to visit there with our parents shortly.

<Content>peace and elegance If you are looking for a quiet, stylish retreat for yourself and a partner Komaneka at Tanggayuda is the place to stay. Valley pool villas are very comfortable with a lovely open view on green rice fields and bush (we stayed in one, but all the other accomodation looked great too). There is peaceful and quiet ambiance in the whole complex. This boutique hotel is elegant in the best Balinese style. We were noticing and appreciating beautiful touches and details all through our stay. The grounds are beautifly kept and are artistic in their own right. The staff at the hotel are helpful, friendly, very discrete and unobtrusive. If you feel like for a chat or need information or service they are more then happy to oblige. All the staff members actually know your name from day one. The hotel offers complementary full breakfast and afternoon tea which were lovely. The restaurant is open all day. There is also a shuttle to Ubud and Neka Museum. There is a sister hotel of Komaneka in Ubud, called Komaneka Ubud. Guests are invited (and truly welcomed) to have their afternoon tea there if they wish (comes handy after browsing through Ubud), facilities like toilet and shower are also available there if required. The hotel also offers range of activities, like yoga, which are scheduled so you have to plan if you want to take part. We spent five days at Komaneka Tanggayuda and left rejuvenated. Regards to everyone there Anna  Peter

<Content>just like in a good friend's home My friend and I went to Bali this January. When stayed in Komaneka Tanggayuda, we were just likein a good friend's home because we could feel the staffstreats us sincerely from there hearts instead of in aprofessional manner.It's easy to find a boutique hotel, but not easy to find ahotel just like stay in a good friend's home.

<Content>nice resort but... Me and my wife stayed in komaneka for two terrible night which rank at the 4rd place on tripadvisor.com . At the beginning it was fantastic, the room was beautiful but than we realize this holiday is a nightmare. the floor was not clean, the white bed sheet turn to yellow, ants everywhere which makes us not comfortable. The toilet was also terible, there's no lights on. I think komaneka resort has no standart while recruiting the staff. Many of the staff cant speak english fluently. There were even staff just can say good morning, good afternoon, good evening, yes and no. The view of the resort was amazing but it was too far from the city. It takes about 20 minutes to go to the market by car. There also no choice than the resort restaurant for dining. I extremely recommended komaneka resort if you want to an unforgetable nightmare holiday.

<Content>Authentic and contemporary I stayed for a week at Komaneka Resort in Tanggayuda to celebrate my 50th birthday, and I felt like a different person when I left. In fact, it did not take a week to reach that state, as it was easy to relax there and experience my rebirth. I enjoyed the privacy of the secluded valley-view villa and the fact that I could use wifi in the room to write my daily blog posts. Few resorts offer that combination. The villa furnishings were contemporary while the entrance to the compound was traditional. Moreover, the staff were helpful and friendly - authentic ambassadors of their very own Balinese culture.
