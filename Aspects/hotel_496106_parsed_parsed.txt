<Content>Only at the Drake What do you call a hotel that gives you the warmest, most genuine welcome you've encountered in your travels? What do you call a hotel where the staff are actually people you want to talk to rather than automatons that simply go through the motions? What do you call a hotel where the rooms have character in addition to four walls and a bed? What do you call a hotel that willingly gives you a laptop charger when you've forgotten your own? And what do you call a hotel that's more than a hotel; a place with a soul, a story and a presence all its own?I call it the Drake and as a guest who stayed there on the evening November 26th, I can see myself returning. And an extra congratulations to Jonathan at the front desk for helping create an outstanding experience.

<Content>major player in one of my best days ever First things, Ana the hotel manager and Jonathan the front desk manager are two extremely shiny gems in a forest of dirty dusty coal in the world of hotels. This is one small attempt to thank them (belatedly) for the help and assistance in arranging for flowers, contingency plans, and a wonderful night with great care and diligence. I arrived to this hotel with my fiance of several hours, wet and fairly exhausted after the several hours of driving, also glowing and newly in on the big secret.This hotel had about 8 staff that I personally interacted with. All of them--and I used to work the front desk of a hotel--*all gave superior service. The sommelier provided my sweetie Steven extra and enthusiastic knowledge for the engagement night bubbly. Jonathan worked with Steven and his groomsman to coordinate arrival and help keep the big secret for dinner and a possible late evening proposal. The entire staff, including the restaurant, seemed aware of the engagement, taking an interest and offering a little extra effort to make us feel welcome and pampered. Never mind that the room (think space allocation of a Manhattan apartment, with very good chic) was comfortable, nicely adorned, and romantic. When we figured out the lights (forgot to pay attention when entering the room), the unique bathing and toilet, the facilities, tiles and colors worked well for us. Bed was soft and comfy, breakfast (beautifully on the house as a gift from Ana) delish, and dinner very very nice. Also, dessert came up to the room for us, when I mentioned I was beat at the dinner table. Two things to bear in mind, but not hold against the hotel, are that rooms require a flight of stairs and parking is not a good idea.When we left there after our one night, I felt as though the Drake Hotel was holding onto a piece of a day that would not have been the same without it. I was reluctant to go. I think of it now, and it is a really excellent boutique hotel, but the people in it are the real stars. Thank you.

<Content>great place for 20-something citydwellers I stayed at the Drake for 2 day, and it really made my weekend memorable. I stayed in room 207 (the crash pad), which was a small but beautiful room. Being someone who lives in a very small studio apartment, I thought they really made GREAT use of the space. On my last night, it was too cold and rainy to go out, so I stayed in and watched a movie and I felt like I was at home. The staff downstairs was very helpful, and were always eager to help 鈥斅爐hey gave perfect directions to the airport using the mass transit (which only costs me 2.75 where a cab ride would have been 40-50 dollars).The Hotel is right near the 24 hour streetcar on Queen Street, which is a hotspot for restaurants, galleries, shopping, and near several ZipCars. For the young Carless city-dwellers, this is a perfect location to stay when visiting Toronto!The only 2 reasons I gave it a 4 out of 5 was because I had to pay a cover charge to get into the bar downstairs (Which I thought was a little lame, especially when I'm staying there). Though the room was very quiet, there was a low buzzing hum you could hear and feel during certain times of the night and the morning in bed that made me grateful that I brought my earplugs with me.

<Content>A gem in a young neighborhood The Drake is a trendy boutique hotel in a local neighborhood. The outside of the Drake doesn't look like a hotel nor does it look appealing. But once you walk in, dine there and go to your room, you will be very pleased. I recommend this hotel for young couples or singles. The food was honestly the best we had in Toronto and I'm from NYC so my taste is very discerning. The service was excellent - Jonathan (front desk mgr) is so accomodating. The rooms are very cozy and modern, but there is very little privacy so love your mate or know your friend well. When you see the glass bathroom, you'll know what I mean. The nightlife was okay-the hotel has 2 bars and it gets crowded. The streetcars stop near the hotel so it's convenient to get around without a car although I highly recommend renting one so you can see more of the city. There are also local shops and cafes nearby so you won't get bored. For those coming from NYC, this is equivalent to staying in the LES. Hopefully, that helps. Enjoy!

<Content>Excellent We stayed at the Drake for a few days in a bitterly cold October but the hotel was cosy and comfortable in every way.The entire hotel was beautifully decorated with great pieces of art adding a playful and fun side and making it unique. The design was very clever, masking the small size of the rooms and making them very comfortable and a delight to stay in. The food in the restaurants and cafe was delicious and the semi outdoor skybar on the roof terrace was a great place to end an evening with a projector showing old movies above your head giving the place a very 'cool' ambiance. There is even a small club in the basement, which we didn't have time to check out but it apparently hosts a lot of live bands. We didn't get disturbed by any music though so I presume that they have their sound proofing well sorted out!The staff were all very friendly and helpful, making you feel very at home. It was situated in quite an arty area with loads of great boutiques and it was even possible to walk (approx 1/2 hr) to the city centre. It was also easily accessable by tram.Although this is a slightly pricier hotel ( although it held up well in comparison to other Toronto hotels), we would definitely recommend it and think it was worth every penny.If you want a more memorable stay, somewhere that can be romantic, fun and comfortable, I would say that this is the hotel for you!

<Content>Drake Too Techno I just returned from my second stay at The Drake. I returned because I like the Toronto Arts District,the fun attitude of the hotel and the nice coffee shop that serves great pastries. There are lots of galleries, museums, shops and eateries up and down Queen Street. My husband and I enjoyed the Drake restaurants and bar the first time around. The second visit I was on my own and was surprised at the change in ambience. The night scene at the Drake was loud and focused on the bar clientele, not the hotel guest. In the evening I had to pass through bar bouncers and lines of wannabe beautiful people to get into the hotel. I wanted to get a late night bite to eat with my son and his girlfriend at the hotel but were forced to look elsewhere because of the techno music was so loud, and permeated all the dining areas. (I am a jazz afficionado, so techno is not my cup of tea...)Still, the service was friendly and helpful. My room was quiet and far removed from the night time fray. I like the hotel, but may choose someplace else next time because it all was a bit tooooo much.

<Content>Unique, Bohemian, Exciting, not really me but... I'm the kind of business woman who stays at the Fairmont, The Ritz, and The Westin. The Drake is as far from those venues as you can imagine. There is no elevator in the three story boutique hotel, the Cafe restaurant is funky and not conducive to meetings, there are only two people running the front desk, and there is a music venue in the basement that attracts mobs on weekends. But I would absolutely stay here again. The 30s, retro atmosphere grows on you, the food is fabulous, the staff of two is welcoming and helpful in a warm kind manner, and the Jazz band in the bar/restaurant on the main floor was wonderful (and the sushi chef talented and creative). The rooms are comfortable and they have an in spa service that got my hair and nails done when I arrived their at 7pm. For someone like me it was a great change of pace--I need to loosen up in life and The Drake is one way for me to do that!

<Content>Take us back to the Drake I booked the Drake Hotel because it sounded interesting and the neighborhood exciting. Usually, we are rather conservative in our choice of hotels, but sometimes adventure is good. However, when we arrived in front of the hotel we were worried that we had chosen wrong.NOT AT ALL! From the moment we walked into the lobby of the Drake, we were happy travelers. The staff was extremely welcoming--mind you, we are probably well beyond the age of the usual guests--and we felt very much appreciated, advised concerning where to go and what to do and where to eat. Our room (they are called crashpads) was funky and minimal and fun--it was also very comfortable, functional and very clean. We loved the quirky touches and got used to the somewhat revealing bathroom arrangement. I am glad we asked for a room on the second floor on the side of the hotel where it was quiet, because at night the Drake came alive with droves of young people and music. After three nights, we felt like part of the hotel and were recognized by the young staff whenever we appeared. We also got to bypass the bouncer which was exciting. The neighborhood around the Drake is full of galleries, interesting shops and little restaurants that are not pretentious. Fabulous shopping for wool. At the recommendation of the hotel, we ate at the Cowbell on West Queen Street which was small and excellent. Breakfast at the Drake was very good.We will return to the Drake in a flash and are recommending it to our friends who like something out of the ordinary. EMcL

<Author>cindygirlOntario
<Content>Great place! We stayed at the Drake Hotel on Sunday November 2nd due to an appointment we had in Toronto. I tried to find something close to the Toronto West Hospital....to our extreme surprise this hotel was fantastic in so many ways. Firstly, its not your average hotel...it had attitude and style. What a difference from the norm. The room was a unique surprise and totally comfortable. There was even a card in the room that said welcome Cindy and Alex...what a magnificant personal touch of class. The girls at the front when we arrived made us feel welcomed and gave the impression they were happy we choose this hotel...what a breath of fresh air....you know yourself that alot of places have staff working for them that never think of giving guests this type of feeling.....We had drinks and snacks on Sunday night. Our server was perfect, friendly, outgoing and took great care of our table. Extensive wine list and unique food. Was a bit pricey but so worth it for the ambiance. In the morning I called down for some coffee, the lady brought it up immediately and called me by name when she arrived at our door....This hotel is a class act....its not your average Comfort Inn thats for sure.Parking is close and easy to find, checking in was a breeze.The only thing i would suggest would be a coffee maker in the room other than that everything you would ever want is in there...right down to snacks, wine with opener and a bottle of water...even a house coast, blow dryer, ironing board, dvd, mp3 and cd player. Nice vibe here.Whoever owns this hotel knows how to run a business!!We will be back!

<Content>One of the best hotel experiences EVER...truly I'm not sure where to start...The Drake Hotel has to be one of the most unique, wonderful, special hotels in all the world...and I've travelled the globe quite a bit. From the moment you walk in you are in design heaven. The design eye and sensibility behind The Drake is evident in every single detail. The lobby, the rooms, the cocktail lounge, the underground bar, the cafe--every single space is a visual delight, the kind that has you oohing and ahhing outloud. And while yes, the look of the hotel is ultra cool--and the vibe backs that up-- the people at The Drake could not be nicer or warmer or more genuine. Go to a spot like this in London or New York and you'd typically find the staff a bit pretentious; this is so not the case here. I think that pairing is what makes this place so fabulous and desirable:uber cool and of-the-moment in its look and hub of activity but wonderful, real, kind, helpful people bringing it all to life. I will definitely return to The Drake; there is nothing like it in the world.You should put it at the top of your list for experiences in this lifetime. Some of the unbelievably amazing people you should look out for and get to know: Jonathan, Zoe and Ana at the front desk; Mia the curator who will show you the hotel's fantastic art; and Anthony in the cafe. signed, Amy from Chicago

<Content>Wonderful Energy, Great Service What a wonderful place - full of beautiful art, interesting people and the staff is outstanding. Being 64 probably makes me a bit older than their average guest, but I would recommend The Drake to everyone. The energy in this hotel is warm and exciting and the people who work there are extremely helpful and fun! The food is delicious and even in The Cafe the presentation is beautiful. And, the neighborhood is full of art galleries and wonderful small shops. I can't wait to return.Ann

<Content>TIFF at the Drake I went with my film partner for this years Film Festival and he slected the Drake- I've traveled widely and stayed in many fine hotels but the Drake was a unique and deeply satsidfying experience. While a cab ride away from many of the festival events the distance was well worth it for the combination of laid-back coolness, a great decompression zone with plenty to do on site. The perfect hotel to stay in if you want to get up at noon and end the night at five a.m.- I stayed in 307- a crash pad and was as comfortable or more so than many larger rooms I've been in. Big shout-outs to the whole staff with special mentions going to Jonathan, Jason, Kiki and Jasmine. And also to the relaxed but ever-vigilent security. I've stayed in other fine hotels in Toronto before but now have a new favorite with The Drake.

<Content>Beyond 5 stars I am 57 years old and have travelled extensively and stayed in many beautiful hotels, but the Drake Hotel now sits at the top of my list. From the moment I arrived until I left, my stay was beyond my wildest expectations - absolutely fabulous hotel, room was amazing and a staff that went above and beyond what one could imagine. Jonathan Leclaire should write a how to book for all hotel managers around the world. Beautiful food, people, location, ambiance - please do yourself a favor and try this hotel - you will not be sorry.Betty-Ann CathreaKelowna, BC

<Content>Coolest Hotel we麓ve ever been!! We have just come back and we have to recommend everyone this cool/vintage Hotel: great decoration, great feeling, cool staff and a Hotel like no other. Wake up in a kind of small apartment that you wouldn麓t mind to live in, take a sexy shower (you will see what I mean when you stay there), have breakfast in their next door cafe, and ready to enjoy an amazing city. And when you come back tired after walk all day, relax and take a cocktail in their amazing patio!And you would also be in a great location to walk Queen St West, the coolest street in Toronto!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: THE KIND OF PLACE YOU WILL TAKE PICTURES OF AND SHOW TO YOUR FRIENDS!!

<Content>Great place! What a fun place this was to stay! We were in Room 205 in a Crash Pad and it was truly eclectic. The room was spotlessly clean and well outfitted. Considering the entertainment available at the hotel and the great number of people who avail themselves of it, our room was surprisingly quiet.The location is a little further west than the downtown/harbor area, but the tram stop is directly across the street so getting around was quite easy. Toronto is not a place you'd choose to drive around in if you didn't have to. While the hotel itself does not have parking, the lot across the street is convenient, safe and reasonably priced. The rooms, the drinks and the food are all a little pricey, but all in all we felt it was a good experience and a great place to stay!

<Content>Great for Sexy Getaway! We live in Toronto, but wanted to have a sexy, city getaway for our 3rd anniversary. I knew that The Drake was a hip, happening place that I had always intended to visit. I researched that the 3rd wedding anniversary is the leather anniversary, so when I saw the leather couch in the XL suite I knew this was the room and hotel for us. I booked directly through The Drake and the people there were fantastic - very helpful, friendly and professional! They arranged for fruits and truffles to be waiting in our room upon arrival, in addition to some items that I pre-ordered from their pleasure menu. They also advised that we could get 10% off on massages at the nearby Hammam spa which was amazing. We had an amazing, memorable night and would definitely recommend. It is not a traditional hotel, but great for modern couples that want a very cool hotel with great people.

<Content>Ok for a 30's middle class ocean liner stateroom Just spent 3 days in Toronto at the Drake. I had high expectations of this top design hotel but thundered down when you check in at midnight. The hotel staff is great but services such as room service etc needs some work.When your tired in late from the airport all one wants is food and a drink. There was no food after 11pm. period. A drink yes on a very hip roof top bar. So great if you need a cocktail and a smoke. But the room which was a salon so larger it was a bit of nightmare after travel and cocktails. Trying to find places to unpack, the lighting controls and the best clothes hangin directly next to your bed.It was a 30's middle class ocean liner stateroom with great staff.The morning is was much better, quiet night sleep and great cafe downstairs. In all the place is great for Toronto as there are not a great number of good hotels. I would stay here with a group of friends or groupies that might become friends.

<Content>A Unique and Unforgettable Experience I literally just walked into the Drake one afternoon and asked if they had any rooms available. I had no idea what I was in for. I immediately felt drawn into the atmosphere and the reception I received made me feel very welcome. My room was like a work of art, but easy, uncomplicated. The food at the cafe was delicious and the service was outstanding. I felt privileged to get to see the organic garden out back and the staff truly took a interest in what I had to say. For me, my short stay at the Drake Hotel, was unique and unforgettable.Linda DiBellaNew Haven, CT

<Content>Great style and friendly staff I had a really great time staying at the Drake. it was my first time in Toronto, and I felt the area was much more interesting than staying in the centre as the caf茅s and quirky shops on West Queen's Street are cool.The hotel is very stylish, with the roof bar and caf茅 having a great atmosphere. The room was also very nice and comfortable. the staff took good care of me, especially the manager Jonathan - thanks guys for a great trip.P.S. - the only thing i would recommend changing is the 'apartment sized' ironing boards which are silly - lets have some real ones when I return sometime next year!Patrick

<Content>Really cool place! We decided to book a room at The Drake because of all the feedback we got from the reviews. The reviews are pretty much acurate. Clean and really vintage looking but modern at the same time. It's a weird combo that seems to work. We were very excited about being able to come back from a concert and being able to chill and have a drink at one of the 3 facilities/clubs in the hotel... however, sure enough a week before we arrived we got an e-mail saying that all facilities would not be available due to some stupid green event. Disapointed is an understatement. What really irked us was that our room was still super expensive without the added benefit of using bars and dining areas. Although we feel like giving the place a worst rating we still believe that when all the amenities are available this is probably a great place to hang out. We just feel on a personal level that we got the short end of the stick.Great people though at check in! We might give it another chance some day.

<Content>Drake - the culteral hub of Toronto where the service is genuine! What a pleasure it was to experience genuine customer service in action -I felt the staff really wanted to help and were genuinely interested in what we were doing in the city, rather than talking from a script.The hotel is a great retreat and a culteral hub, offering good food and drink, with fantastic transport links to the tourist attractions, gallarys, museums etc. Although some distance from the centre of Toronto, it is walkable and enables you to get closer to the real vibe of the city.

<Content>A special getaway! My husband and I were just visiting our son in Toronto, and courtesy of him and a friend, we had a night at The Drake. Also included was a wonderful dinner in the restaurant. We absolutely loved the place! The outdoor bar was great, the meal was superb, and the room was something really special. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>My Stay at The Drake in June of 2008 When I stayed at The Drake in June, it was for a wedding. My two best friends where getting married on the Friday night.So I came into town on the Thursday night. Once I got to the hotel, I couldn't believe my eyes!!!! The way I would define it was Vintage/Modern design. The Service was EXCELLENT, the rooms where AWESOME. The night life was so ALIVE!!!!I felt like I was at home. If I ever want to take someone for a nice weekend in Toronto, I will return to The Drake hands down.Thank you again for an AWESOME stay at The Drake.Victoria

<Content>the total package - great vibe, great room, great sleep! I loved my experience at the drake - the restaurant, cafe, and sky yard were all awesome - great vibe, fun menu, and well-planned wine list. my room was small but not at all cramped - just extremely well laid-out, and the super comfortable bed gave me a wonderful night's sleep. Thank you Drake - can't wait to come back!

<Content>The Drake was Cake Stayed at the Drake Hotel while my partner was here on business. The staff here is PHENOMENALLY helpful and friendly (great-looking, too!).I mentioned that I wanted to go sightseeing and snip-snap they printed Google maps of locations I wanted to see and highlighted my route for me. They helped me print  fax anytime needed.I went thrift store shopping, returned to the hotel with my haul and asked for directions to a laundromat -- their manager offered to take my laundry home  do it himself! I asked for recommendations of hair salons; they offered several and then mentioned that their cafe' manager cuts hair as well. The haircut she gave me is adorable (I'm not making this up)!The food is generally moderately priced, and totally delicious. Downstairs outdoor cafe' dining is balanced with a fun, funky lounge, a restaurant area, and an upstairs patio offering outdoor drinks  mingling. The Underground is a great space for music; a gilded proscenium arch framing the stage makes it resemble an old-school theatre.Great design here -- every space is packed with something fun and funky; what might have been a pommel horse in another life greets you when you come in the lobby, and beyond the reception area an antique photo booth anchors a guest seating area. The hotel seems to be a hangout for Toronto folks as well as a draw for travelers. The Drake's renovation was apparently one of the anchors that drove the West Queen West renaissance in recent years.A few notes -- We stayed in one of the crashpad rooms, which were small (though their small space design solutions have a hip, clean minimalist Japanese aesthetic). Wireless in our room at the far end of the third floor crashpads required a lot of network surfing to stay connected, but elsewhere in the hotel fellow conference attendees had blazingly fast and reliable connections in their rooms, so might just need another wireless booster down this end.Finally, there's no lift / elevator, an issue for the differently abled.But for those of us who need a good flight of stairs to tighten our bums anyway, the Drake Hotel is a fantastic value in a unique place with great folks who will make your stay into a fun memory, not just a space to lay your head. An excellent value.

<Content>the country wife I think before I mention my stay I should say how I booked my stay..as other doesn't really do it!!, my brother lives in the UK .. with the rest of my family and decided to organize some last minute Christmas shopping for my wife and I.. he knew I liked Lulu lemon clothes and so called their branch in Vancouver.. they called him back and chatted for 10 minutes, organized my clothes gift and at the end of the conversation asked the girl he was talking to to recommend a cool hotel in downtown Toronto. She said she used to live in Toronto and thought the Drake a great place to stay.. he checked it out online and booked it for me as my Christmas gift.. I then thought that I should use it as my wedding anniversary present and left my son with the inlaws and headed down town with my wife. SO thats how we came to be here..the stay was excellent.. I was surprised to learn on my arrival that Stephanie knew of my name and knew about one of my ancestors.. after 38 years of travel finally someone knew the name and was so thrilled to realize that I was a direct relation to someone she had studied, and may have even depicted some of his plays on stage.. anyway I was blown away. I think she enjoyed that too!!Stephanie, Jonathan and Jason were extremely helpful and very welcoming.. the rooms were great, service quick, food excellent.. Loved the raw bar, and the sushi was exquisite.. ( lived in Japan for 6 years) .. I recommend it highly, food in the lounge was totally worth every penny and a drink in the roof bar finished things off perfectly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting something a little more exciting than the usual hotel.. its decor is amazing.. and who could really want for more.. other reviews depict the hotel perfectly.I will be booking my brother a night when he is over on this side of the Atlantic and look forward to revisiting again sometime in the future.Thanks for the help and making our stay so excitingcheersWillGuelph Ontario and Shrewsbury England

<Content>No mistake to stay at the Drake! With tickets to a Leonard Cohen concert in Hamilton but no desire to stay in Hamilton, the Drake looked good for a quick run to the concert and a couple of days in Toronto. With only 19 rooms of varying size (and cost) the hotel nonetheless provides all anyone could need. Great location on a major streetcar line in a burgeoning art studio section of Toronto, it includes a fine restaurant that serves breakfast till late afternoon as well as lunch and dinner, a lively bar scene that attracts locals as well as guests, and a commitment to fashion, design and art that is apparent throughout the hotel. The young staff who serve as a kind of collective Concierge are knowledgeable, eager to help and made our stay easy and fun. Parking across the street is $10 for a 24-hour period. Will certainly stay at the Drake again.

<Content>Loved the Drake! My husband and I had the unique experience of staying at the Drake Hotel in Toronto. The Drake is a venue for the artistic crowd and those who want an eclectic experience where amazing food, drink and warm atmosphere are second to none.Everything from breakfast in the cafe, dining in the comfortable, yet elegant dining room, munching at the raw bar or having a drink in the sky yard was a culinary experience we will not soon forget. The pastry Chef is AMAZING!The staff at the Drake really make the place. They are a group of professionals who have been well trained, extremely friendly and take pride in making your experience fun. We felt pampered for the three nights we spent there.The rooms are small but would rate five star on these small spaces. Everything we needed was in our room. I would suggest the third floor as the noise was controlled. Lots of action in the hotel in the evening, so not for those who are looking for three days of reading in your room.The area is a bit tired but you can see the positive changes happening in the neighborhood. Lots of great ethnic restaurants within walking distance.All and all, a terrific experience.

<Content>No reason to stay other than at the Drake I have an affinity for chic boutique hotels and The Drake met and exceeded my expectations. Located in the very trendy Queens West section of Toronto, Drake sets a high standard for the others to follow. The staff is professional, courteous, beautiful, engaging and committed to ensuring a pleasurable stay. The Drake is as advertised, Hot Bed for Culture. Toronto's bold and beautiful hang out here, be it on the second level Sky Yard, on the Cafe+Boulvard Patio, in the Lounge or The Underground with their live music and luxurious modern trappings. Be assured of a wonderful enlightened experience at The Drake. I've no reason to stay anywhere other than the Drake. Thank you to Anna, Jonathan, Kiki, Angie, Stew and all the other staff members who assured my return the nex time I am in town.

<Content>Always love the Drake - fun, funky, friendly I have been staying at the Drake for three years every time I go to Toronto for business. The rooms are very well designed, the vibe is fun, the restaurants are great and the staff is friendly. It's the best value in Toronto.

<Content>Cool vibe at the Drake I had the pleasure of spending at night at the Drake earlier this month and had a very cool experience...from the kind reception I received upon arriving to the awesome crash pad...only good things to say. Special mention must be made about their beds...honestly the best sleep I have had in a while...only challenge is leaving it in the morning.

<Content>Welcoming and helpful I was very pleased with my stay at the Drake recently.They provided an accomodation that was clean and welcoming, and I was especially appreciate of the fact that the staff went out of their way to set me up with another accomodation as they were fully booked for the second night. Recommend it without hesitation, and plan to stay there more often when in Toronto. Thanks!Mark Wilkins (the guy with the doppelganger)

<Content>Loved the swanky Drake. My boyfriend lives in Toronto, but we booked a night at the Drake for a nice getaway. We couldn't have been happier with our choice! All of the rooms at the Drake have corresponding names, and we booked a Crash Pad. The room was small, but more than adequate. Whoever designed this place was impressively good at optimizing space - there was room for the bed, a desk, a bench, an overhead luggage rack with a sliding ladder, and the entire bathroom area. Our bed was COMFORTABLE like I could not believe. I would definitely recommend this hotel as a place for open-minded young (or perhaps young-at-heart) couples. The shower is a glass box directly across from the bed, and the room service menu is billed as the first erotic room service in North America (there wasn't any food on it, by the way...) We had a lovely time bonding, and left feeling completely refreshed. The hotel had some nice extra little touches that I thought went very far to foster my good opinion. They use Aveda bath products, which are wonderful, and have a book-of-the-month club, where they provide you with a book at your bedside to read at night or take home (my boyfriend snapped it up before I got the chance!) Additionally, the most convenient parking for the Drake is a municipal lot across the street; if you give the desk staff your license plate # and keys, they will feed the meter for you and add it to your bill so you have no worries during your stay. The street car runs all along Queen St., making using the public transit in Toronto very convenient. Additionally, they have a very cool bar  lounge downstairs, an open-air patio on the roof, and a nightclub downstairs. We grabbed a drink in the lounge and caught some very, very cool live music before heading out for the night. Very swanky. When we got back, there was a line-up down the street for the nightly entertainment; we just flashed the doorman our room keys and jumped the line. The Drake definitely treats its guests like VIPs. I hope to be able to treat myself to another night here in the future!

<Content>Sort of grows on you if your not a chain junkie Okay, just got back from a 4 day stay in Toronto. This was our treat since we could not make it south this year. This is a hotel that requires an open mind. It is a small hotel that is extremely active and is meant for people who do not plan to hang around the room, order room service etc. We arrived on Thursday. Our plan was to stay at the hotel, eat in the DR then go dance a bit downstairs in the dance lounge. We wanted to take it easy after a 5 hour travel and stay low. Well, quash that idea! The entire place was reserved for a private party. We paid 219.00 for the night and we could not use any of the amenities the hotel offers. We were not happy. We explained this to management. They were very professional. They promised to work hard to make our stay memorable. OK so lets see. Friday night we had supper in the dining room. The manager Patricia came over to us aware of the situation from the previous night. She offered us a complimentary glass of champagne. The meal was great. We ate often at the hotel during our stay. Very good interesting food. A credit to the hotel. Prices are reasonable.After our supper we went out and arrived back at 3:30 am to find some people yelling in the hallway. I confronted them and things were okay after that. However 3 hours later at 7:30am we were awoken to blasting music from the hallway speaker system. I ran down the stairs to the FD to ask them about it. Turns out there is a short in the system. Went back to sleep awoke to find 2 comp breakfast passes. After that the rest of the stay was pretty uneventful. Summary: rooms are small but very nice and stylish. Very contemporary bathroom setup. No bath and could use more light for makeup etc. Beds are amazing. You cannot have other people in the room after midnight. Hotel has great food and a hot lounge for the younger crowd. Overall staff are excellent and very helpful. Although we asked a girl at the FD about the restaurants close by that they list in their guide. She said she just moved there so had no idea. Didnt bother asking the other employees who were there. Small thing but it matters in a place like this. Its a very personal hotel. One big warning!! Check the events calendar at the hotel for private parties. It can be a real hassle when they have these private functions and you are forced to go out. I must add the staff really understood this issue. I got the impression from mngmnt that they are reviewing that policy. You cannot charge guests 219 a night then say you cant use the dining room or the bar etc. Bad policy, plus we were checked at the hotel entrance twice. private party remember. Even the guests were in the way. We will stay there again but we feel mgmnt really underestimated our disappointment our first night. A glass of champagne did nothing to change that. On that one note the hotel missed the mark. Fun place, fun neughborhood, personal type hotel. We will see you again Jonathan.Dave  Monique

<Content>Canadian Perfection I can't say enough great things about the Drake. Brilliant use of space, the room is tiny but you almost don't notice because the execution is so perfect. The common spaces are hip, inviting and the staff is helpful and friendly. We were snowed in all day and didn't mind one bit. We spent the day entertained by great staff, food, drinks, movies and stayed warm by the fire in the lounge. There are boutique hotels that are 'cool'. This hotel is far more. It is inspired by the creative art community it is in and is a treat from check in to check out. It is not a business hotel; the stairs are a bit treacherous and the place is hopping til 2am, so if you want quite, easy and spacious, go somewhere else. This place is for those that appreciate the art of living.

<Content>Funky, fun and hip Drake Hotel My husband is originally from TO and we have stayed at all the typical hotels (King Edward, Hilton, Sheraton Centre) but this was our first time at The Drake. It was fun, hip, edgy and cool. The location is too far from the main stream to walk so a car is necessary. The rooms are uber hip but efficiently small. Saturday night was rockin in The Lounge with a great DJ. There was even the typical velvet rope and lines waiting to get in but we flashed our room card and walked straight in. Good reason to spend a weekend night! Sunday late afternoon/early evening the Skyyard (rooftop) was the place to chill with a mojito, sushi and a more laid back DJ. Lots of locals visit The Drake. Warning this is not your typical hotel experience, it feels more like staying at your chic friends SoHo/NYC apartment.

<Content>Irishcurse This was a last minute stay, only one night on Carrabana weekend. We heard about this hotel from friends of a friend while sitting over cocktails at Mother's in Buffalo, NY. These folks were so excited about this hotel that they actually had it on speed dial. After twenty minutes they had my girlfriend and I so excited that I called on the spot and made a reservation.The Hotel is in an artsy neighborhood, well west of downtown TO. We had drinks in the outdoor cafe while waiting for our room to be readied. To say the neighborhood is eclectic is an understatement, but it is fun.Our room (301) was a Den about 185 sq. ft. and it was incredible, what a great use of space! Hard to believe that there is so much in such a small place, the room itself is FUN. The public spaces were great. We had a great dinner in the Dining Room with a wonderful server named Allen (Al) quite a character. While dining they had a Jazz group playing in the lounge which is on the other side of a staircase that goes to the SkyBar. The SkyBar is the happening place in the area, again all kinds of people, all ages.The employees at this property are outstanding and always willing to help with all your needs. A special thank you to Stephanie the front desk clerk who checked us in and explained everything about the hotel.While this hotel may not be for everyone, be adventurous, go for it, you will not regret it.

<Content>Great place to stay! The room was spacious and clean with a very funky decor. Loved the shower. The people working there were incredibly friendly and helpful. I was worried that the evening entertainment would interrupt our sleep, but you couldn't hear anything once you were in the room. Loved having drinks and sushi upstairs on the deck. The neighborhood is great for window shopping, too! We highly recommend the Drake.

<Content>Great Place to Have A Wedding I was married on the roof of the Drake with the reception in the Underground and it was amazing. The staff is incredible. The artwork and vibe of the place makes the whole experience interesting. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>Had dinner and stayed, Loved It! Wow! It was an amazing experience. I stayed for the weekend and the hotel is so retro fun! I loooved it! I had dinner in the dining room and the service was amazing, and the food was incredible. Chef Anthony Rose really had a flare for his cuisine. I ended up staying after dinner and having a few cocktails on the Sky Yard then heading back to my room. The entire staff was so helpful and the building was immaculate. I would recommend this venue as a great place to stay while visiting Toronto. The whole Queen West area is so safe and there is so many interesting shops and cute bars. I can鈥檛 wait to visit again!!

<Content>A Funky, Trendy Alternative Oasis. I've just got back from staying at the Drake Hotel, Toronto.This place is so cool with lots of nice touches, (especially the 'Sock Dolls' in each room). Super Trendy roof terrace bar called the 'Sky Yard', and a really nice Cafe on the corner of the hotel. Great location for lots of bars and restaurants. this hotel will appeal to those who are looking for something different than the normal stereotypical chain hotel. We stayed in a 'Crash Pad' room which was so well laid out, you soon forgot that the room was small.Staff were excellent and will deffinatley return to the 'Drake'.

<Content>For the hip and not the hip replacements We recently flew to Canada from London, UK to produce an event at the Drake Hotel. As a first snap shot of Toronto is was a great starting point. The area is superb, probably the coolest part of Toronto - though i suppose we all have different cool-ometers! bars, restaurants, Trinity Bellwoods park, lots of shopping - it's all there. China town is a 20 minute walk as is Kensington if you are into a taste of Mexico and loads of second hand clothing stores. The experience at the drake could not have been topped. We stayed five nights and were gutted to leave. I think the hotel concept rocks - GREAT decor, amazing staff, cafe, roof top bar, lounge, bar, restaurant, club - all under one roof - all very arty and cultured in my opinion, complete with an artist in residence. Their finger is on the pulse and lots are seeming to follow. We were there on business producing an event called Shoot Toronto.. We ate breakfast at the hotel cafe every morning, used the free WIFI access to death - generally spent a lot of time in the cafe outside on the veranda - there was a heat wave that weekend... This hotel is for the hip and not the hip replacements. I can't wait to go back. See my blog for more - htttp://www.shootexperience.com/blog

<Content>Exceptional Service! I stayed at the Drake hotel on March 1st, 2007. I just wanted to say that your hotel was fabulous. I will always remeber how wonderful it was because my now fiance asked me to Marry him there! I found the service just amazing. I used to work in the hospitality industry and I really value good service. All of your staff was super friendly and definetly exceeded our expectations. Thank you so much for making one of the most important days in my life even more wonderful!

<Content>Once is enough Unfortunately I did not take the advise of a previous reviewer and I ended up in Room 203. What he didn't mention is the beer deliveries that commence each morning. Each keg as it is delivered at about 8 am is slammed onto the sideway. The finale is the noise as the empty beer bottles are sent dwon a conveyer to be loaded onto the truck. All this at about 8am.The design of the room was brilliant and unique. The sheets nice, mattress could have been better.The service was spotty. Some were pleasant and helpful at the front desk, some had an attitude - I think it is a age issue - all of them pretty young.There is no help in to the front door even if you are struggling with two back and opening the door. I think they must be amused to watch. No bell man. Though they did find me help to get my bags up the stairs. Though I was on my own on the way out. No elevator.I thought the location to be a bit out of the way in terms of downtown. There is a street car stop that makes it easier but if you just like to walk like I do - it is a hike.The cafe was great - I enjoyed the yougart, fruit and granola dish. Lots of locals like it as there hangout. I wasn't too disturb by the evening activities but i see how some unexpecting guests would be. There are three bars and they are very well known. Noise wasn't too bad the days I was there.Definite a place to stay at least once but for the price they charge I expect better service and attention and afternoon beer deliveries.
