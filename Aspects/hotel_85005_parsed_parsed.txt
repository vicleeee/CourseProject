<Content>Good location and shuttle service Miami: Red Roof Inn Miami Airport: Good location and Shuttle service.Date: November 25, 2008Reviewer: A TripAdvisor Member, Bruges, Belgium.We just stayed 1 night in Red Roof Inn Hotel, Miami airport. This hotel is good if you need a room 5 minutes away from the airport. We slept very well and did not hear an airplane. The free shuttle of the hotel works very good. You don't have to give a phonecall on arrival, because every 30 minutes the shuttle goes to the airport for pickup, excepted some hours in the middle of the night. In the morning we had to go to the office of Avis for pick up of our hired car, and the shuttle brought us to the entrance of the office, so very convenient. The room itself was clean enough, but does not look as nice as on the pictures on internet. In the corners were some big holes in the wall and the bathroom lacks some finishing touch. There is no coffeemaker in the room. Breakfast has little choice, but enough to start the day and there is a nice terrace at the breakfast area, so you can take the breakfast outside if you like. All by all a good hotel if you just need 1 night close to the airport.

<Content>Depressing hotel Depressing rooms, worn out with the smell of smoke that 200,000 smokers were in the room at one time. Decent price for an overnight but not worth the dark experience. Next time would find some thing better or sleep at the airport on the rug at a gate.

<Content>Not a bad place to stay. I stayed @ this Red Roof Inn and I rather liked it. No big whoop and really, who needs a fancy shmancy place to lay his head anyway?It's not exactly a destination point now is it?For me..just a stop between home and the Caribbean.I had a good time swimming and laying in the sun.I walked over to a fast food joint which served interesting Caribbean fare.I also walked to a nearby gas station for snacks and drinks.I found my 2 days there to be pretty relaxing.The desk clerks were friendly and helpful.All in all it was a good stay at the Red Roof Inn. Dig it!As a matter of fact, I will be staying there again this December.So, I say go ahead stay there and remember 'A good attitude goes a long way'.Satisfied guest.

<Content>Dirty, Filthy Flea Bay of a Hotel Booked this hotel for a pre-cruise stay for our group of 52 people. Our travel agent suggested this hotel as reasonably priced. IT WAS AWFUL. We had quite a bit of luggage for our cruise and only one elevator was operable. The rooms were gross. They smelled nasty and were dirty. No hair dryer either so a lot of our party looked a bit different the next day. Bennigan's next door was o.k. Shady characters hanging around.Continental breakfast was pretty much non-existent. Coffee and juice machines were empty or broken. The few muffins that were put out were pre-packaged frozen muffins. Those were gone so early because they probably put out a dozen and that was it. I specifically checked on the availability of the shuttle service to the port since our group was large. They told us it would be no problem and that we should be ready at the pool at 11:00. Only 12 or so people could go on each shuttle trip and there was only one bus. By the way, the bus had a flat tire and the driver drove us all around town to try and fill up the tire. We were the first group to go to the pier. The rest of our group had to wait almost 3 hours to get the pier. The bathroom in the lobby ran out of toilet paper and these poor people had to sit out in the hot Miami sun for a long time with no water or anything. It was a joke.I called the general manager of the hotel when we returned from our cruise. He denied any problems with the hotel. After months of wrangling with the general manager and the corporate office, we were able to get a refund for all of our group members.Very poor service and dirty rooms. Never, never, never would I stay here again nor would I suggest it for even one night.

<Content>Worst place ever We stayed at this hotel pre cruise for one night. We never did get a room key, they would have to walk us to the room and open the door. The room was not very clean. We only had 1 towel, and we were not able to get more until the next morning when housekeeping got there @9:00. We also ran out of toliet paper (before housekeeping got there) and asked the front desk for more and they told us to use the bathroom in the lobby. The shuttle list for the cruise was very long and they only had 1 shuttle, so the wait was a while. We took a cab. The coffee machine which made regular coffee (not flavored) was not working. I will never stay here again. We brought this to their attention, but they were not interested in helping us at all. Many other guest were complaining also.

<Content>Disgustingly dirty and badly maintained The desk clerk was solo and did his best to help us. The first room was filthy with dirty sheets on one bed. I asked for fresh sheets and the clerk had the security guard watch the desk while he ran them to me. I stripped the sheets and found that the mattress pad beneath was stained all over and the bed was broken and lopsided with an old, dirty, sagging mattress. The carpets were dirty and the walls ewre marked with stains on the upholstry and carpets. I asked for a new room and he obliged. The next room was similar but not as bad. One bed was sagging and unmistakingly broken. The property in general is run down with dirty, unvacuumed flooring, pizza fliers littering the halls and insides of rooms where they have been shoved under doors. The doors slam all night as there are no door stoppers and it is noisy. Based on the price and other comparably priced satisfactory hotels in the area one would expect a much higher standard of service or at least a clean room!!!

<Content>Great for the price and location I'm no professional hotel critic, but after reading all the negative reviews I expected it to be a dump, but it was a pleasant surprise.Free shuttle came every 30 minutes to the airport, just make sure to flag it down because it doesn't have a designated stop anywhere.The room was clean and the pool was really nice.The only discrepancies were with the staff...which there primary language was spanish but they did speak english. It was just hard to communicate some things I was trying to say exactly, but got the overall message across.Also the continental breakfast was doughnuts, muffins, and apples. They also had coffee and hot chocolate.Besides that it was a good overall experience and for only staying one night for a grad interview, it was everything I expected.I would stay there again.

<Content>Reviews are pretty much accurate I wouldn't stay here again. The rooms are plebeian, and the free continental breakfast is a joke. We had good luck w/ the shuttle from the airport, but the line for the port was very long; we opted for a taxi.I noticed that some people were able to pay $85 for a night here. That sounds about right for the experience. Unfortunately, we paid $180 for the Saturday night of Presidents' Day weekend; the hotel certainly isn't worth that. Benningan's is right next door and serves good food, although their signature sandwich, the Monte Cristo, really can't be finished by anyone who's not a glutton. Good for transients, but you wouldn't want to spend more than a night here.

<Content>Not Great, but OK for the price Was OK for a cheap place to stay before a cruise. Friendly, complimentary shuttle from airport and to the port. We stayed in one of the newly redecorated rooms out in the back building. Clean and comfortable for our group of 3. Continental breakfast not so great. One of the friendly staff recommended a cuban cafe a block away to get some really good sandwiches. Pool area really noisy with airplanes flying over, but couldn't hear them from the room.

<Content>online-booking in vain I booked the Red Roof Inn via RatesToGo, because they offered a real good rate. A deposit was paid by credit card, I got a mail from HotelClub confirming the reservation with a booking ID. The rest of the money should be paid directly at the hotel. When I arrived at the Red Roof Inn they couldn't find anything about my reservation. I showed them the mail from HotelClub I had printed out but it was rejected - quite unfriendly - with the wonderful argument a booking ID is no confirmation. I had no time to look for another hotel so I took one of the last available rooms which of course had to be paid in full and at a much higher rate.The room was clean and simple and would have been absolutely okay for the rate that went with my booking - but not for the price I finally had to accept. Maybe the problem was not caused by the hotel, but still their handling of the whole thing was pretty poor.PS: It's more than 2 months now, but I'm still trying to get the deposit back.

<Content>The worst hotel I've ever stayed in, in my life!!!!!!! I've stayed at some bad hotels but oh my goodness... this one takes the cake - BY FAR!!! We arrived to stay the night in Miami before flying to the Carribean. We chose Red Roof Inn because it was 5 minutes from the airport. The ONLY good thing about it! When we checked in, they gave us a room that was 50 degrees in it! I'm talking, the AC was on full blast turned to dark blue cold! They switched us to another which wasn't really better. We asked for a non-smoking room, but there was a muggy, stale smoking odor in the room anyway. The shower  tub was in bad condition, leaky  rusty. Hot water didn't work very good. We worried about sleeping in the bed, wondering if the sheets  covers were clean because there were women in the hallways trying to get customers (meaning prostitution). When we walked past 2 rooms on our floor, the smell of marijuana filled the hallway. The entire night we did not sleep. There was loud noise from the pool area, loud noise up  downstairs, the room's smokey odor made it hard for me to breath while I TRIED to sleep (cause I have astmha) and it was pretty much a nightmare. We even heard the front desk people chattering to eachother, using profanities while we were walking our 3 year old out the door. Totally unprofessional  a total SLUM is the word. PLEASE, do not stay here!!!

<Content>Just Say No!!!!!! Horrible.................. I booked this property because it was centrally located to both Miami Beach and Kendall. Things went down hill from the moment we walked in. At check-in, the clerk shouted out the room number, although she had written it on the folio, the lobby was full of people. The following day, we opted to assist with the conservation of water and opted not to have our linens and towels changed. To our dismay, after a long day of appointments and shopping we returned to find that our towels were removed and not replaced, upon calling guest services we were told to come to the front desk to collect towels, we also wanted a clothing iron which was to be collected. We walked over to be informed that they only had bath towels and that all of the irons had been lent to rooms for which they had no log. One of the clerks, Milton informed me that he was just coming on to work th 11pm-7am shift and as soon as an iron was available, he would call my room. Never happened! To add insult to injury, returning to the building where our room was located, the entire place was thick with the smell of cigarette smoke, the elevator did not work and the ice and vending machines were inoperable. This hotel boasts that it was recently renovated. What was it like before? In the future, I'll just stay away from anything that is remotely related to Red Roof Inns, and advise everyone to do likewise.

<Content>Poor Hotel and Staff This place is terrible, we arrived after a flight from Gatwick, UK we wanted to book in, get a coffee and a meal, bed and ready for the cruise the following day, we were told our room number by a chap that wanted to be elswhere, the room was on the 1st floor, we had 2 heavy pieces of luggage and the lift was out of order, we got to the room which had a strong musty smell, the bathroom was small but clean, the wash basin is not in the bathroom but in the main room ? the room was not very clean, although the beds were ok.We wanted a coffee, but at 9.30pm we could not get one, when I asked at reception they said it was not possible.We went to Bannigans next door which is adequate for a supper and a beer.The following morning I was up at 5.30 am and wanted a coffeeonce again this was not available until 6am, WHY ?The breakfast consisted of doughnuts and muffins, if you were quick enough.As I booked through Carnival I assumed the hotel would be of a decent standard, Carnival should look at this part of the operation, the feel good experience should start when we get to Miami.If you have a choice DONT STAY HERE.

<Content>Wow - cheap but awful Hotel booking process easy and simple - beautiful property on the outside. Transportation to the port was wonderful - quick and easy to utilize. That's the good - the not so good - The pool was lovely but couldn't be truly enjoyed because of the noise of very close airplanes taking off. Cleanliness of this property was not a priority - hallways reeked of urine, cigarette smoke; bathrooms in the rooms were not clean - moldy and smelled. Elevators were slow- one was not working; Walls between rooms very thin - could hear conversations through the walls. Coffee machine for continental breakfast was broken our entire stay; breads were of questionable quality.

<Content>Ok....for an airport hotel Stayed here with my family, after a week cruising in the Caribbean. We arrived before checkin in time, around 10 in the morning. But we were able to check in. The hotel is not a 4 or 5 star, hotel so we didn't expect any luxury And for the price we paid it was fair enough. The room were big enough to fit 4 and 8 luggages.This wasn't our hotel of choice since it was in a land  sea package provided by my mother's travel agent. The hotel staff were friendly and helped us every time we needed them. There's a Bennigan's next door (serves food like TGI Friday) and there's a busstop 100 meters away that goes directly to Miami Beach area. Shopping malls are 10 to 15 min away by car. Taxi can be expensive if you鈥檙e on a budget. The pool was great and was open 24 hour. We went swimming middle of night..!!The hotel is near the runway or landing path, but didn't have any trouble sleeping. Nor my mom (and she's a light sleeper) Free shuttle was handy and made sure we arrive on time to check in. All in all a great overnight /airport hotel.

<Content>terrible Had to call the hotel twice for the free bus to pick us up after waiting one hour it finally came. Went to check in at the front desk and they had the wrong price of about $40. After talking with the 2 ladies they keep telling me that I had the wrong amout, but when I told them what I was told even with taxes what the amount would be. Then an employee came out of the back room who heard the conversation and she told the front desk lady that the price that I keep telling them was on the computer and the front desk got mad at her and told me she was new and did not know what she was doing. I feel like they were trying to take the $40 for the two of them. Finally they gave me the price but I was told the manager could change it back the next day, so I paid by my credit card and had them make a copy of what I have signed. Rooms were not clean. The free bus to the port was so late that we almost missed the ship at 4pm. When we did get on the bus luggage was all over and people was sitting on the luggage and the floor. We all signed in the day before but the hotel made no arragements for all the people who were going and of course I was the last group but the first one on the list since the lady calling the people was the same lady that tried to get me for $40 so just be careful of the front desk workers:)

<Content>Bad and noisy From outside and still in the reception the hotel looks OK, but onece you get in the corredor, the elevator and the rooms the experience becomes worst and worst.The hotel fells unclean, in the elevator you get a felling that you will get trapped in it, the bath accesories are terrible, the bed just ok, Rooms are noisy, and everytime one door in your floor is closed you feel a terrible noise in your room.Breakfast is poor, one mini donnout, a small muffin and terrible coffee.Staff is nice and parking is safe and convenient. Location is very convenient since is just 5 minutes from Miami airport.

<Content>Pretty basic Needed to stay in the area at the last minute, and my husband booked the Red Roof Inn at Miami airport. It was a pretty basic room: no hairdryer, and toiletries included one soap sliver and a sample pack of Breck shampoo. Room was large, but a lot of empty space. Beds weren't very comfortable. The shower rod was not installed properly and hung, so the curtain didn't hang right and was mostly open. Toilet tank cover was too small (obviously a replacement) so there was an open gap at the top of the tank. Towels were pretty skimpy (more like hand towels than bath towels). The room did have a TV, safe and phone. The free breakfast included warm juice, donuts, apples, packaged muffins, and coffee from a machine. The breakfast area was not big enough to hold the many folks staying at the hotel. If I needed to stay by the airport and this hotel was super cheap, I would consider staying there again, but it would not be my first choice. For the price (150/night) it was not a great deal for us.

<Content>Not a bad deal, good service as well. This hotel was a perfect hotel for a lay over. I looked it up on Google earth after making reservations only to find out it is extremely close to the end of one of the airports runways. I have to admit I was pretty worried but I stuck with it to give it a chance.I have to say I was extremely surprised, the planes were flying overhead of the hotel yet all you could here was a very faint rumble as if the plane was extremely far off in the distance, I had no trouble sleeping! The rooms seem to have a double panned double tick glass that keeps the noise out; I was extremely happy.The room was very nice and clean with a very pleasant bathroom.My only complaints, location and breakfast. The location is pretty bad, there is a bennigans right next door but nothing else and the breakfast in the morning consisted of juice, apples, a few muffins and a few donuts. I was pretty disappointed with the breakfast.The Shuttle service was very fast and efficient and the drive was very pleasant. I thought this was a great value for what we paid.

<Content>Adequate It serves a purpose after a long flight but thats about all as there are some well dodgy charcters hanging about. Room was quite large but planes too close for comfort. Free coffee and buffet breakfast was ok, shuttle to Port was good. All in all wouldnt stay there again unless I had to

<Content>Disappointing The reception staff were friendly and helpful, but the room left a lot to be desired. The corridor leading to the room was littered with fast food leaflets  you could hear peoples conversations. The room was very damp, in fact the carpet was wet  the paint was flaking off the ceiling as a result. The television screen  pictures showed obvious signs of damp. The pillows had ominous dark stains on them, which could clearly be seen through the pillowcase. In all the room was clean, but very cold. The advertisments claim that this is a redesigned  rededicated property, I dread to think what it was like before. We chose the hotel due to its proximity to the airport  that Red Roof Inns are part of the Accor Group, but found it difficult to find. In fact it took almost 2 hours to find, not something you want after a 9 hour flight. Have subsequently complained to Red Roof Customer Relations, but their response shows disinterest. I'd think very carefully about choosing this hotel. Do your research, there are plenty of other hotels in the area, which offer better value.

<Content>Good hotel for the traveler. After staying in the Ramada Miami Airport North and being totally appaled at the conditions - I called the Red Roof and booked there for my layover on the return trip. The airport shuttle was fast and clean. The lobby was bright and helpful desk folks speed me through registration. The price was right $85, and the room was clean with the new comfort beds, pillows,and shower curtain. It had internet access, HBO, cold A/C, new paint and decorations. Not sure what the other reviewers were unhappy with. We loved it - maybe just redone??

<Content>Filfthy! Only one night couldn't kill me, I decided, despite the spate of bad reviews. Well, the reviews were right.When I checked in, there was no bellboy. The desk clerk suggested that I leave my luggage in the lobby overnight. Yeah, sure. I might've had an arm in a cast, but part of the purpose in staying at a hotel was to be able to access my luggage, right? For $175/night, I must've been mistaken. When I reached my room, it was filthy and disgusting. The toilet hadn't been flushed, the bed unmade (and this was around midnight), and there was no telephone. When I made it back down to the front desk, I was given another room, which was only slightly cleaner. At least it didn't appear to have been used since it was last purportedly cleaned.The halls were filled with garbage and left-over food. The doors didn't strike me as very secure.The continental breakfast? I've seen hogs slopped under more sanitary conditions. Ooze and goo covered the counters, and the facility looked prime for ptomaine. This place has to rank among the worst of all hotel experiences I've had in 50 years.

<Content>Put Chairs up against the door This Hotel was horrible. Never again. Figured one night couldn't be that bad, omg. We got to our room which was filthy but figured one night? So there were some advertisements under the door for take-out food and we ordered some . I called the front desk and asked how they would let them in because you needed a key to get in the building and the front desk clerk told me these were people who made the food in their homes and sold it. Make sick he told us. So I figured they couldnt get in the building since it was locked, well one hour later they are pounding on our door and yelling and calling the room. I was scared to death.So we didn't answer and we didn't sleep all night. So if you have to stay there is no security and you need it in that part of town.

<Content>Good enough My wife and I stayed one (last) night in the Red Roof Inn at Miami Airport onJjune 5 2006. Checkin in went fast and profesionally. The room was clean but very sober. Nothing wrong with the beds. They allow dogs in this hotel and there were plenty of them...... In the room opposite to ours someone left his barking dog unattended for more then two hours. At eight it kept quiet, either the dog has had a heart attack or his master returned. We'll never know but we were relieved anyway cause nobody in the hotel payed any attention to what was happening.The hotel loop on Lejeune is kind of hard to find. Once you know you're way around Miami Airport it is no problem. The question is who knows his way around this area? We've been here several times and it seems you drive from one detour into another. The hotel is located at the end of the runway of Miami Airport and planes fly over very very low but surprisingly they caused not so much noise as the barking dog. So we had a good night rest. Breakfast is a donut, but who cares? There is a Bennigan's at the site and it was surprisingly good. Rental car return is right around the corner. What more do you need?Nothing wrong with this airport hotel!

<Content>Terrible Terrible, Terrible! No one cares at this hotel. Employees are like zombies. Very busy,and loud. Location is horrible as well. Not easy to find. Good luck trying to get directions; or anyone on the phone who cares to listen to you. Poorly managed. TERRIBLE.

<Content>glad was just for one night Arrived after long flight from uk - was just booked for one night before we left for the Keys. Hotel staff very freindly and welcoming - pool looked ok. breakfast was ok. Room smelt of damp, and also the bathroom floor left a lot to be desired - some sort of wooden veneer on floor which smelt of urine! not ideal flooring for a bathroom. However the room and bath / sink were clean.Not sure that I would book again

<Content>OK for one night We stayed at Red Roof Inn for one night, because we had an early flight and wanted to avoid the hassle in the morning. First problem was that arriving by car we found it difficult to find the entrance to the hotel and ended up making circles around the place, until we decided to return the rented car first and then catch the shuttle to the hotel. Finally arriving to the hotel they did not have our reservation. I had made it and paid it through travel agency two weeks prior the arrival. The two receptionists talked spanish with each other so it was difficult to follow, but it seemed to me that they just made a new reservation, luckily fot us they had rooms available! The room itself was OK for the price, but nothing to tell to your grandchildren about... We took the shuttle to the airport at 6 o麓clock in the morning and that worked properly. Probably wouldn`t stay there again, but it was tolerable.
