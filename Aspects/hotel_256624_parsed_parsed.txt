<Content>Great experience at Quay West! After staying in Sydney for 3 weeks and experiencing 3 different hotels, we stayed for 5 nights during New Year's Eve. This was by far the best experience we had in Sydney (also stayed in Hilton and Radisson Plaza). There is no hotel at this price range (we paid A$227/nt) that combines space (we stayed in a 1 bedroom suite with king bed), location (in between Four Seasons and Shangri-La in the Rocks), and service (manager upgraded our room to have a bridge view; bellman courteously moved our luggage from one room to another with a constant smile).As always, we book everything on Wotif.com to get best prices.If you need another validation, the Australia cricket team during the Ashes tournament stayed in Quay West Suites (I'm sure they can stay anywhere).

<Content>Booked 5 nights...left after the first one Booked this hotel for 5 nights after reading former tripadvisor reviews and left after the first one. It advertises as a 5 start property, which has nothing to do with reality. I still can't understand why people write good reviews about this property because my opinion is very different from theirs.It all started when I checked in... I ordered a taxi to pick me up in an hour's time, when I went to reception the whole lobby was empty, needless to say no taxi was waiting for me.The rooms are big but the ceilings are very low which makesyou feel trapped. Windows don't have double glazing and the noise of the motorway kept me awake all night. Walls and ceilings seem to be made of paper, I could hear all the conversations of the rooms around, let alone their children crying at 5am. The gym is tiny and old and the pool was full of kids and dirty.The remaining of my stay in Sydney was at the Park Hyatt (see review there also), which really made a difference.

<Content>No compassion or understanding for changes of booking dates We were very disappointed to hear this hotel is not very compassionate about guest who need to make changes to their booking due to extreme circumstances. Our situation has us caught up in the Bangkok protest meaning we are not able to get to the hotel as we originally thought. We attempt to call them up to 'change' our booking dates and not cancel it and advise them we are stuck with no other alternative. They were quick to shrug off our desperate request. We understand of their No Cancellation Policies and we accept this, but we are not trying to cancel, but merely just change our dates. At the rates charge per night, I think they could have been a little accomodating. So basically our hard earned money put towards this hotel has been forfeit due to the lack of understanding by this hotel. Again we stress, we did not want to cancel as we still wanted to stay at the hotel, only just change as we are currently still stuck in Bangkok till the airports are re open.

<Content>Good choice for extended stay with family Stayed at the Quay West in October for one week. Arrived via taxi and baggage was immediately taken and delivered to the room. Hotel was quiet and check-in was very quick. Our room, 1003 was a nicely sized one bedroom apartment. Room looked to be in good shape (little wear and tear). We had a partial view of the harbour, mostly of the city. There was a full kitchen. We cooked dinner a few nights. Although plenty of plates, glasses and utensils, there were a limited number of pots and pans. Technology wise, there were plasma tvs in both the living room and bedroom and broadband access (although quite expensive). Washer and dryer were in a separate room. The bathroom had separate shower and bath but some of the towel holders were coming off the wall. Electronic safe was particular as you needed to use a personal credit card to open and close the safe (versus a keypad). However, plenty of space to lounge out.One problem was the street noise. Surprisingly, the windows can be opened and the insulation was poor. We could hear the music coming from outside late into the evening on the weekend.Bed was ok, not the most comfortable bed that we slept in while in Australia. Hotel location is excellent. Walking distance to the Rocks and Circular Quay. In between the Shangri-La and the Four Seasons. Was a steep hike but there is an elevator that takes you up to the lobby from the street below. Breakfast was included in our rate and the buffet breakfast was good but not the largest number of choices. Swimming pool was on the roof. The pool was heated and had a wonderful view of the city of Sydney. Very popular with the kids including my son who wanted to swim every night after we got back.No problems with checkout. There was a 1% credit card charge as they had indicated when I booked the room. Had booked a taxi the night before and was there waiting for us. Overall, enjoyed our stay. The Quay West is a good choice for an extended stay especially with family.

<Content>Great for a longer stay My husband and I recently stayed at the Quay West for a week, having been recommended to go for the comfort of a suite rather than an ordinary hotel room. This turned out to be good advice, as we thoroughly enjoyed the spacious suite and excellent amenities, with plenty of storage and somewhere other than the bed to lounge if we needed to. Housekeeping was sometimes slow, to the point that we had to remind of the need for our room to be serviced a few times after returning from a day on town. But overall, the hotel was very nice and comfortable. The Quay West is within short walking distance from Circular Quay, the Botanical Garden, Hyde Park and the museums as well as shopping. Unfortunately, if you are returning from Circular Quay, the last bit of the road is on a rather steep climb. It feels twice the length when you're suffering from jet lag, but is not insurmountable. Coming in from other parts of town, various route options bring you to the hotel on easier paths.While the location allows you easy access to the ferries and shops, the area as such is a bit dull. Typical fringe-of-financial-district kind of atmosphere, with restaurants and pubs catering for the office crowd. For an interesting and different feel, it is worth heading under the bridge towards Darling Harbour and taking in the new (?) pier conversions along the seafront there.

<Content>Great Family Choice in Sydney My wife and I and two teenagers recently stayed at this suite hotel for a total of 7 nights. We stayed here for 3 nights and then left to tour other parts of Australia (conveniently leaving several pieces of luggage in storage at Quay West) returning for 4 nights.We were very pleased with our choice. First off, the location is excellent. Very well situated with walking distance to Circular Quay and the main shopping district. Secondly, it was a very convenient choice for a family such as ours. we had a two bed, two bath suite so we avoided having to get two separate rooms. It had a full kitchen, living room and laundry facilities which is great for extended stays and to prepare a simple breakfast. The buffet at the hotel is very nice, but expensive. If you prefer that, at least ask the front desk for vouchers, which reduce the cost from AUD 30 pp to about AUD 21 pp.The very best feature of the suite was our stunning view of the Opera House and Harbour. This alone was worth the price of admission. On the other hand, I'm not sure this is a great choice for a business person trip. Taxis aren't easy to come by, the internet service was down and even when working, not handy, etc. The service was friendly and good, but I would classify this property as a 4 star, not a 5 star. Still, for a family, this is a wonderful choice.

<Content>Not just a hotel.. more like an apartment with privacy and quiet I checked out of Shangri La to stay at this place, and really wished I had stayed here the entire 30+night stay in Sydney. The hotel is in the Rocks area, sandwiched between two streets, which makes it SUPER QUIET. It is hard to find, as the back entrance is off Harrington street. Full laundry, dishwasher, oven, microwave, fridge, yet maid service, mini bar, etc. Everything anyone needs is at this hotel, including room service. Why eat in the room, though? We brought water, soda, Arnott's cookies , etc to the room and really had peace and quiet. The views were amazing as well. Not once did we hear other people. There are very few rooms on the floors. The residents live in the high floors. We loved this place. My biggest complaint, however, is they changed the rates on us after we booked the place. I really had to argue with them about this. I suggest getting your rates PER NIGHT in writing 100%. They upped our rates on various nights by $69 AUD. I had to speak to the manager, as I felt scammed. They ended up finally just increasing it by $19 on various nights. How can a place get away with this? We were told our rate was $159 per night for 7 nights. When we checked out, some of the nights were $180, $205, $169.. very strange--WHAT A SCAM, and WHAT UTTER BS. Other than this, we loved the staff, the hotel, the convenience of being so close to everything, yet blocks away from the noise. We would return here, but would simply request the nightly rate--BY DATE-- in writing. The hotel does not have the service of Shangri La, but feels more like home to people. LCD TVs in the living room, bedroom also, nice bathroom, Bliss shower products, dish soap, laundry soap. Doing laundry while traveling is a nice convenience and this alone makes this place worth staying. Even if there is noise, which we did not hear, you can turn up the air such that it is loud. DSL, etc for a price, pay per view, etc. Staff was really nice here also. Did not care for the changing rates.. I am really not sure how the hotel can get away with this when they do not appear to disclose this with guests--they maybe forgot to do this with just us? Doubtful.

<Content>Nice view, shame about the hotel The Quay West Suites facing the harbour boasts spectacular views of the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. Unfortunately, the 5-star rating of this hotel ends there. Service at this hotel was poor, and certainly not up the the standard of a luxury hotel. The in-house restaurant is only open on Fridays...any meals taken at other times are solely via room service, which also happens to incur a $5 service charge. When orders come, they arrive with mistakes, and the standard of the cuisine is mediocre (though why you would want to eat in-doors being so central is another matter). Serious room faults were repeatedly reported, but never acted upon by front desk staff; the severity of the problem was only acknowledged when we were checked out by a more senior member of staff. The promise of a suite upgrade on a future visit however, is somewhat wanting. During our stay, the swimming pool, spa and gym facilities were being upgraded, though check-in staff neglected to in form us of this...would anyone have checked into a 5 star hotel knowing this? The hotel is well located in the Harbour area, though the standard of the hotel itself was inadequate, as were the facilities and usefulness of the staff. Book a suite if you want a room with a view; go elsewhere if you want the 5-star experience.

<Content>Room with a view but a possible security issue We had a two-bedroom suite with an absolutely amazing harbor view. Imagine walking into your hotel room and seeing the Sydney Harbor Bridge and Opera House out your room window!Window opens slightly, no balcony. Laundry facilities in the room. Two bathrooms with a kitchen area. There's a mini bar and an empty refrig for your personal use. Includes microwave oven. Comfortable and clean. We were on the 23rd floor which is the same floor as the indoor pool and fitness area. Can't comment on the hotel food because we didn't eat there. Staff was helpful. We did not rent a car. We were able to walk to all of the important sites. This hotel would have received a higher rating from us had it not been for the following.....Strange encounter: Don't mean to sound paranoid but we thought it strange when we we returned to our room in the late morning unexpectedly and found our room door inoperable. It had been bolted from the interior. We persisted only because we had had a room key issue earlier and were shocked to have a man open our room door. Although he was in a maintenance-type uniform and had a tool box, he was in our room and had bolted the door. He immediately said, Oh, your heat is fixed. This was really strange because we hadn't reported any heat issues. He immediately left. In retrospect, we realize this should have been reported to hotel management. None of our valuables were missing but we had only been out of the room for a short time before we returned.

<Content>Great Business Hotel Had a five night stay at this hotel - and it was exactly what you need for a business stay.The staff were superb, especially the Mel and Mel show at reception. Nothing was too much bother and they were all keen to offer their personal opinion on where to go and what to do.The rooms were large, very functional, had superb views and all the additional extras that you'd look for in an extended stay (love that they had individual laundry machines and dryers).Location could not be better, only five minutes to The Rocks and even closer to Circular Quay.Would definately stay there again.

<Content>Ideal location on the Rocks Quay West suites are superbly located for Circular Quay. The rooms were well maintained and quite spacious. We had a city view room, which was fine. There is a viewing room on 23rd floor from which you can see Sydney Harbour bridge and the Opera House. The suites are well situated for excellent restaurants along Circular Quay. Martin Place and the rest of downtown are within easy walking distance along George St. We would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Fantastic views and location We stayed for 2 nights at the end of March in a 2 bedroom harbour view suite. We were on the 19th floor and the views are stunning of the Harbour Bridge and Opera House.The apartment is well laid out with the bedrooms set back along a corridor before you reach the living/dining area and the spectacular view. The kitchen is small but adequate though with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby, you are unlikely to do much cooking. The bedrooms were very quiet, despite the busy Cahill Expressway in front of the building. The bathrooms were both fine with the en suite off the main bedroom having both a bath and a separate shower.The apartment is spacious enough for those of us suffering jet lag to get up at 430am and not disturb those still sleeping.We enjoyed the swimming pool on the 23rd floor as well as the gym on the same level. We did not eat in the restaurant and frankly, it is much much cheaper to eat out locally for breakfast. We bought lots of deli goodies at David Jones' food hall and there is a good Bottle Shop (off licence) a short distance a way in George Street.The furnishings are not lavish as some have noted and if you are not booking a room with a harbour view I am not sure it is worth the cost.We had free valet parking and we found the reception staff helpful.Our children want us to stay there again when we next return to Sydney.

<Content>5 star accommodation - a let down Was looking forward to staying at this 5star hotel. Had booked a 2 bedroom suite for 4 adults and a 1 bedroom suite for my elderly parents. The view from our suite was spectacular, however the general cleanliness of both suites were very dissappointing. eg. Grubby dining chairs, glassware needed cleaning before using. Pool was filthy. Smelly bathroom, large brown stains in grout around toilet, shower didn't drain properly, hence overflowed onto floor. Took ages to drain away. Worn and stained carpet. Have stayed in 5 star accommoation before and this was no where near it. Would not recommend this place.

<Content>This is definitely the place to be. We have just read the previous extensive review and every word is correct. We were amazed by the view from our 20th floor suite - it seemed like a four day entertainment that had been put on for us with the bridge, opera house, the harbour and the Rocks area in full and splendid view. The suite was just like a home with everything that we needed and the space...................amazing!Melanie, Graham and Melissa could not have been more helpful from the moment we arrived to when we left.Also, it is so convenient with George St, Circular Quay and the main shops just a few minutes away.Breakfast was excellent and although we had planned to try other places, after the first day, we only wanted to breakfast there. We were truly sorry to leave after our 4 days and look forward to going back as soon as possible.

<Content>Expensive but worth it We stayed as a family with 2 young kids in a 2 bed harbour view suite. My God well worth the extra for THAT view - a completely uninterrupted and direct view of Opera House, Harbour Bridge and Circular Quay - we could have sat all day and night and just looked out the window. We requested a higher room to get a better view and got the 22nd floor. Really great location for the quay (literally 5 mins walk to ferries, watch out for the steep walk back uphill), the Rocks and the CBD, so overall I'd say worth the price. They were chocca full but the service was still good. Our suite was thoughtfully laid out, spacious, clean, well decorated and maintained with all the facilities you'd expect. Kitchen and bathrooms nicely luxurious, living area furniture was a bit functional and practical, I guess geared at long stay families who no doubt give it a bit of a hammering, but still tasteful.  Good room service menu, we only ate once in the restaurant for breakfast as it was a bit businessy, but so many great restaurants around no problem. We loved this place, very sad to leave (had to relocate to slightly cheaper apartment!) and would definitely recommend.

<Content>A+ for Families at Quay West I have stayed at this property four times now with my family and the Quay West has yet to dissappoint. We first stayed at the Quay West seven years ago on the recommendation of a travel agent. After arriving in the middle of a record setting hailstorm, the entire city of Sydney was without power. The with charm and grace, the bellhops lugged our giant suitcases up 10 flights of stairs with only the glow of flashlights to guide us. Huffing and puffing, it was an experience I will never forget.We returned to Sydney in August 2007, again to stay at the Quay West. I must say I was just as pleased years later. We love the magnificent view and the spaciousness of the apartments. The location is perfect for sightseeing. Everyone in our family of five had their own comfortable bed - plus two bathrooms AND a washer/dryer. The kitchen is adequate. Perfectly suited for a take-out dinners and everything you need to make your own breakfasts. There are grocery stores within walking distance. One of our rooms had an enormous patio.But perhaps our favorite amenity of this hotel is it's swimming pool, hot tub, workout room and sauna on the upper floors. There is nothing better to combat jet-lag or relax from a day of sightseeing than a refreshing swim or a work-out. Most of the time, we were the lone occupants in the facility. The view over the city and harbor is breathtaking.I highly recommend Quay West for families looking for higher quality, spacious accommodations in a picture perfect location in the heart of Sydney.

<Content>Really Great The best hotel I have been at. Staff were great. Room was excellent, big, very big, clean, includes eveything you need (dishwasher, washing machine, dryer...) . Yhere is a big bedroom and a big living room. This is standard in every room. Rooms with seaview cost more (no need). Italian restaurant near at the corner is recommended (I didn't like the hotel restaurant). Hotel breakfast is O.K. (breakfat staff not helpful). All main places to see are walking distance (See view from bridge, from there walk to Sydney Opera House, from there walk to the botanical gardens, from there go to Hyde Park, from there to Shopping passage) I had good sunny weather. Only bad thing I can say was that the room smelt of cigarette smoke when turning on the A.C. The staff were helpful (even though they pretend the hotel is full when you ask to extend the stay, and afterwards say they have found an opening). I stayed 10 days for business. I would advise staying here. It made my stay in Sydney worthwhile.

<Content>Great Views and Location Stayed in a 2 bedroom/2 bath room overlooking the Harbour. The view from the room was amazing - you could take in the Harbour Bridge, Circular Quay, Rocks area and Opera House.Saw fireworks over Harbour one night from room.Room was really clean, with nice furniture, a good sized kitchen and a small laundry room with washer/dryer. Very quiet on upper floors.Great location for getting around and seeing the sights. Restaurants in the area are kind of pricey - better to go out towards Chinatown or other neighborhoods where the locals live.

<Content>Good location but will not stay again My newlywed wife and I stayed here on our first night as a married couple. Actually we stayed here for 3 nights (we booked a special package - stay 3 pay for 2). We arrived after our wedding reception at approximately 12.45am and we were checked in straight away. Our bags were brought up to our room by the bellboy - fantastic.When we booked the room we made a note to the reservations office that it was our honeymoon and we had requested either a harbour view or a floor high up. We ended up with the latter (approx 15 floors up from memory). The view was ok and if we looked to the very side of our living area we were able to see a glimpse of the harbour bridge. Lucky for us if we looked into the reflection of the windows of the hotel opposite we could in fact see the harbour.When we had settled into the room (approx 20 mins later) I phoned reception and requested a bottle of champagne or wine be sent up (because I was assuming this would be included already and 'waiting in our room'). We were expecting a no problem sir it will be up shortly but instead we were cut off and were told that we would be receiving a call back from the night manager. About 10 minutes later the manager phoned back and said sorry we are unable to offer you any champagne as you did not request it when you booked. WHAT? AM I HEARING THIS RIGHT??? We could not believe what he had just told us!! To be denied this on your own wedding night really got us down. I mean we have had friends and family stay in cheaper accommodation on their own wedding night and they even got a surprise in their room (strawberries AND champagne). But for us we got NOTHING. Only a room on a supposed high floor. We really felt like we were staying in a motel at this point on. Because thats how we felt we were being treated.Don't get me wrong, the room was lovely and spacious, bathroom fittings were ok etc. The location was great as well (5 min walk to Circular Quay, the Rocks etc). We would not stay again though and I would definitely NOT recommend it for honeymooners unless you ensure you email the property 1 week before checking in to make sure you get your complimentary bottle of champagne, even though they will probably try and charge you for it!!!!! How ridiculous...

<Content>Beautiful Views from the Quay West Spent one night here in October 2007, for a girls night away. There were 6 of us, and we were originally booked into a 2bdrm and a 1bdrm, but asked about the 3bdrm when we arrived. Although the 3bdrm is usually only available for a minimum of 2nts, they had one available, and the wonderful concierge was happy to book us in. He even gave us a tour of the 3bdrm vs the 2bdrm before we made up our minds...Well, the 3bdrm definitely won us over, as did the promise of access to the private swimming pool/sauna/spa. We had a great evening and no-one complained about the bedding.I'd recommend this hotel to anyone wanting good value with the MOST AMAZING views of Sydney harbour. We could see way out over the Heads and out to sea - 2 lots of fireworks went off on the harbour that night - what a treat!

<Content>Great views from here We stayed at the Quay West Suites in August. For two nights out of the three here, we paid for an upgrade to a harbour view room. It's expensive but the view is worth it. The hotel is in an ideal position in The Rocks and close to the main places to visit. Our suite (1705) was big with all the facilities needed for self-catering ; it had two balconies overlooking the bridge, harbour and opera house. Reception was helpful and quick. Getting back to the hotel means a walk up a steep slope which may not suit everyone at the end of the day. However, if you enter via the car park on Harrington Street, there's a lift into Reception at Quay West.

<Content>Phenomenal View It's worth staying here just for the view. Imagine the perfect postcard view of Sydney's landmarks and we got it in our harbour view 2 bedroom suite. To wake up to that view for the 3 nights we stayed there was brilliant. The rooms are excellent, plenty of space for 5 of us, the pool's were good, the only downside was the breakfast price but as someone else pointed out there are plenty of cafe's nearby so really a non issue. It's close to everything you want to see like the bridge and opera house plus close to the boats that take you round the harbour or too the beaches. All in all a great location and would recommend this with no fear of criticism.

<Content>Great Location My husband  I were really impressed with the standard of these apartments. We had views of the city from our balcony, which were fantastic - every bit as good as those of the harbour. The rooms were decorated to high standard (mini bar prices were even higher than normal though!).Location was excellent, right in the heart of everything and only a short walk to the Opera House, Bridge  commercial district. The last part of the walk to the apartments is fairly step, but nothing that someone of even average fitness should struggle with.Pool was fantastic, on the 19th floor so it has amazing views over Sydney. It also contains a spa bath, sun deck and sauna, and the pool was heated to a great temperature. We tended to go out in the morning, back for a swim and then out again later. We were there for 4 days and never saw a single other person in the pool!All in all a great choice, we would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Excellent value for view, space and location We spent four nights here with two 2-room suties for our extended family. We agree with most of the previous comments, except we believe this is excellent value for the views and location, and would stay there again. Agree it is not a 5-star hotel as far as quality of the rooms, but you are paying for the large room space, views and location. We have stayed at 5-star hotel suites in the same area and paid almost twice as much.....so, for a large family this is not a bad deal.Completely agree that the $31 breakfast price is a ripoff, although they offered us a deal that we could buy in advance for all the morning breakfasts for $20 if we took that price when we checked it. We declined....there are many little breafast shops in Sydney within walking distance. .

<Content>Spectacular View We have just returned from a 4 day stay at the Quay West suites. The view from our suite was spectacular, we stayed in a harbour view room which overlooked Circular Quay, the Harbour bridge and the Opera House. The room itself was self contained encompassing a small kitchen, laundry and full bathroom. A king size bed in the bedroom was not very comfortable actually it was rather hard. We felt for the money we paid $332 a night which was discounted due to an entertainment card discount of 10% the room was definitley not worth a rating of 5 stars. I think you are paying mainly for the position and the view.Also the buffet breakfast at $30 a head was a big let down, the hot food was not hot and the selection of all food catergories was very limited. Staff all seemed friendly and when asked would help out as best they could. Overall an ok stay but wouldn't pay the money again to stay there.

<Content>Nice stay, good hotel We walked in to this hotel on the way to see our suite that we had booked at the next door Shangri-la. The staff were welcoming and friendly ( Mr Ivada and Ms Catarina especially). We subsequently chose this property over the Shangri-la because of the wonderful views, the more useful and useable space, the balconies and a nice clean decor. We'd stay here again anytime.

<Content>Amazing Views From a 3* Hotel My family and I stayed at this apart-hotel for 4 nights at the beginning of April. We had booked a 2 bed, 2 bath suite facing the Opera House and the Bridge. We got exactly what we booked!We arranged with the concierge to organise a taxi for us. Although it was confirmed, the driver arrived 15 minutes after we came throughcustoms and only after I telephoned to chase. A great start!We did arrive earlier than the stated check in time and we did have to wait for the room. The suite itself had an amazing view and the size of the suite was excellent too with a fully fitted kitchen, dining room, 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The only downside which cheapened the suite was the furniture which probably came from Ikea. The beds were not the most comfortable either but the view was unbelievable only eqally by The Four Seasons and The Shangrai La located either side.Our room rate included breakfast which was an adequate buffet. Basically, what you would expect from a 3/4* hotel. The gym was quitesmall and clearly hadn't been cleaned for quite a while (a real let down), the indoor pool is simply a large plunge pool.Position of the apart-hotel in The Rocks area is ideal for getting around and there are many great restaurants close to the Hyatt (5 mins away).Would we stay there again? Probably not. I think we would prefer the luxury of one of the real 5* hotels next time.

<Content>We loved this apartment We stayed in the Quay West apartments during the Sydney Bridge celebrations in March. The apartment was well appointed and very clean and being situated at The Rocks very convenient for sightseeing. We found the reception staff very helpful and likewise the lady who cleaned our room each day.We enjoyed a concert at the Opera House and a trip under the Bridge in a flotilla during the 75th Bridge celebrations, altogether a visit to be remembered.We had a great time in Sydney which was made all the more enjoyable by our accommodation.[-]

<Content>You pay for the views!!! Great views- Yes!!! 5 star - not so sure...Found staff not very friendly at all and seemed annoyed if you wanted them to do anything or asked them anything. Bathroom was fantastic and the room itself was good but I'm not sure if value for money was obtained. A bit overpriced for me...I've stayed in better!!!

<Content>What a fantastic location!!!! We arrived in Austrailia very jet-lagged but when we were shown our room we all just stared out of the window. We were totally blown away by the spectacular view which encapsulated the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. Our next few jet-lagged sleepless nights were a joy with such a fantastic view! Day or night the view is amazing! The room was very spaious with two bedrooms and bathrooms and a very well equipped laundry room and kitchen. We were two minutes walk from Circular Quay so we were able to get ferries easily to Darling Harbour and the surrounding Sydney. There are also plenty of restaurants (although slightly expensive) within walking distance and the hotel has an ample buffet breakfast every morning. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and would most definitely stay there again.

<Content>Buisness trip okay Stayed at the Quay West during a business trip to Sydney. The suites are adequate, the location fantastic. I was in a single suite, which had a large living area. The kitchen had a very good set of kitchen utensils, crockery etc compared to what I have found in other suite hotels. Air conditioning could be directed either to the living area or bedroom. Cooling was okay but it is a cumbersome system, especially in summer.Staff are friendly but not that attentive to detail, such as having to carry my bags out to the taxi and requesting a hairdryer twice.

<Content>Great views, lacked service and poor security If you can get a harbour view 2 bedroom then you will have some amazing views from these suites. Bathrooms and bedrooms are not 5 star standard but they are a good size.Housekeeping in this hotel is terrible - our room attendant argued with us when we asked why our room hadn't been cleaned as requested and then got angry when we asked him to wait when he came back and he told us that we were keeping him from going home!! Rude and unacceptable. Hotel management were apologetic and did go out of their way to fix problems.Hotel security is a problem - 4 pairs of jeans went missing (assumed stolen) from the room / property store.

<Content>Amazing Hotel We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in September 2006. Everything about the place was excellent from the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out.The staff could not do enough to help us, especially the concierge. They helped us find our way round Sydney, giving us maps and information. Nothing seemed like too much trouble for anyone.The hotel itself was more like our own apartment. We had kitched, utility room, lounge, bedroom and bathroom. The view of Sydney was spectacular. The swimming pool and leisure facilties on the 23rd floor were good, and the views from here even better.The hotel was very clean and tidy. Its location is great too, as it is close to Circular Quay, The Rocks, Harbour bridge and Opera House. Overall an excellent place to stay and we'd definately stay here again.

<Content>Disappointed I was disappointed by Quay West. It is in a great location with wonderful views, true. But it is definitely not a 5-star hotel. I was excited to stay there after reading reviews here and it didn't live up to its billing. It was clean and tidy on the surface but there was no attention to detail, the furniture was tired, the front desk staff nice but not terribly helpful. The kitchen was really randomly appointed so cooking was actually quite difficult (and as I was staying there with a toddler I needed to be able to cook). That said, room service was good.It wasn't bad, but wasn't great either.

<Content>Great location and hotel This was our second time visiting Sydney and the Harbour Rocks area. But the first time at the Quay West Hotel. The hotel is in convenient location within walking distance to the harbour bridge, ferry boats, opera house, gardens, shopping, restaurants (you do not need a car). The rooms are suites with kitchen, living room and a laundry area. All the comforts of home. The view from our room was over looking the harbour. It was easy to stand by the window for long periods at a time. The staff at the hotel was very helpful. We look forward returning to Sydney and this hotel.

<Content>What a View !!! My wife,child(3 years)  I stayed at Quay West for six nights  during september 2006.We had a harbour veiw room and it  was great. The room was clean and tidy,and was much larger  than a hotel room.The view was fantastic  the location was  within walking distance of everything we wanted to do.We used the ferry system for any travel to far to walk so we saved on car  hire. Danielle (our daughter) loved the pool  swam morning and night. The pool  spa area was always clean  tidy. Quay West staff looked after us well  went out of their way to make Danielle happy. We would stay at Quay West again when in Sydney. (especially with children)

<Content>Amazing! What a view! This is an amazing hotel with good facilities and right in the centre of the Rocks Area of Sydney. The view from our room was priceless, with the sydney harbour bridge and the opera house. We only ate breakfast in the hotel but that was to a very good standard with our children eating free everyday. The pool, gym and sauna on the 19th floor was very clean and modern. Overall I would recommend Quay West Suites to anyone as it has a priceless view from the room and has excellant food and facilities.

<Content>Very disappointing We stayed at this hotel over Easter and had high expectations because of its cost and advertised features. When we had booked we were not told that this '5 star' establishment would effectively be non-functional due to the Easter weekend - the restaurant was closed ( and a 15% surcharge added to room service because of the holiday!), the bar was closed, the spa and sauna were out of order and unable to be fixed because it was a holiday weekend, much of the gym equipment was broken and only one lift appeared to be working. The rooms were average but smelt of cigarette smoke.Yes the view is good, but with no balcony there is a sense of distance and detachment to it and, having stayed previously in a hotel with a balcony, would strongly recommend - if you can afford the sort of price you're paying at Quay West anyway - go to a hotel with the view AND the balcony !The majority of staff there were polite. But when we tried talking to the management they were surly and argumentative, particularly when we suggested at check-out that a rate reduction would be appropriate. We took the step of writing to the CEO of Mirvac Hotels after our stay and received a reply from the hotel manager, offering us - wait for it - a complimentary night's stay at Quay West, Sydney. Apart from the unlikelihood of us getting to Sydney again in the remotely near future, it is only in our nightmares that we would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>The View is its saving grace i stayed here 4 times in my trip to Australia. 3 of these trips kept me wandering why I was in this hotel in the first place and the last answered it. I spent the 1st 3 trips in a room facing onto the four seasons hotel, a monument to bad design and an ever present figure in the room. The furnishings in no way made up for the lack of the view but they were functional and comfortable, while being very forgettable and not what you would necessarily expect in a hotel this expensive. The pool too was not as amazing as other reviews suggest: although the view was good, it could not be seen while in the pool which incidentally was extremely cold. On my final visit I was upgraded to a room overlooking the harbour (2105) which frankly took my breath away. In fact I was glad for the lack of fancy furniture as it would only have taken my attention off one of the most famous views in the world.

<Content>What a view! We stayed here for 6 nights at the end of our Honeymoon last month. We got a good deal which included parking  breakfast for the full duration of our stay and it was much cheaper than the ShangriLa etc. The view from our suite was just to die for! Sydney Harbour bridge on the left and the Opera House on the right - what more could you ask for! The suite itself was very spacious and comfortable. We ordered room service on a few occasions and each time it arrived very promptly and was tasty. I have to disagree with previous reviews of the conscierge in this hotel as we found all the staff extremely friendly and more than helpful. I do agree with the slightly dodgy tumble drier and very poor shower pressure but they were minor annoyances compared to our overall stay.

<Content>"Average" Have just returned from a trip to Australia/Bali via Bangkok and having stayed in top class establishments we were looking forward to our 5 nts at the Quay West Suites. The reviews on this site,apart from one honest person were good. What a huge disappointment. This apartment can be best summedup as clean and functional and may suit some families.The kitchen area is outdated with equipment at least 10 years oldand is in good condition because it's hardly been used.The whole apartment could have done with a complete refurbishment. .The only positive was the view especially at night.

<Content>Great in (almost) all respects Our family of 5 ( children are 16,14 and 11) just returned from a 3 week vacation to Australia. When in Sydney (total of 6 nights) we stayed at Quay West Suites. With one exception, we could not have been happier with our choice. Quay West is ideally suited for almost all activities. It is in the Rocks, about a five minute walk to Circular Quay and a relatively easy walk to both the CBD and Darling Harbour. Our two bedroom suite overlooked the harbour with a great view of the opera house, the bridge and circular quay. The facilities in the suite and the hotel were first rate and the employees were both friendly and helpful. You know it is in a good location when on one side is the Shangri La hotel and on the other is the Four Seasons!Quay West provided good value for us, especially considering our alternative, when travelling with 3 children, was to book two hotel rooms. The suite, with full kitchen and laundry facilities, was far better suited to our needs than a hotel room.When checking in we were offered the chance to sign up for a discounted buffet breakfast---and this was the only negative we found about quay west. Breakfast was mediocre at best and was still expensive for the five of us. There are so many other choices in the area, especially in the Rocks, that provide a good breakfast for great value, that I would not sign up for the quay west breakfasts again.Overall we very much enjoyed Quay West, would not hesitate to go back and would highly recommend to others, especially those travelling in groups of four or more.

<Content>WHAT A VIEW!! Just found this site so writing my first review. The Quay West, Sydney is wonderful. We were in a two bedroom unit as they call them over there with a sofa bed in the lounge. We were on the top floor and the view was spectacular, overlooking the bridge and the Opera House.The units are well equiped and we had one ensuite bathroom and a house bathroom, beautifully clean and tidy and the beds very comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped and spotlessly clean and there was a utility room with washer/drier. We also had room service most nights as we were exhausted from our sightseeing during the day. The food was good but not great but was delivered quickly, was hot and reasonably priced. With a view like that who would want to go out again!!They do drinks and nibbles in the bar around 5 which were great and the staff were delightful.The pool on the rooftop is incredible and you feel like you're swimming in the harbour!! Apparently it's one of the most photographed pools in the world. We were served champagne while enjoying the jacuzzi. Thought I'd died and gone to heaven!Wonderful experience and would definitely go again and recommend to anyone visiting Sydney.

<Content>So pleased with our stay Stayed for five nights in April. Thought the location was fabulous. We didn't have a harbor view and that was just fine. We had a one bedroom as we were traveling with our daughter. The layout was great and the staff was polite and helpful. Because we opted for a cityview, the price was very reasonable. I do agree with the last review that the shower pressure was weak. Just a small inconvienience.

<Content>Harbor View from 35th floor was a living postcard Just returned from Sydney and had four restful nights in the Quay West Suites. Note, these units are owned by investors/individuals and managed like a hotel. As such, furnishings and conditions will vary room to room. We stayed on the 35th floor with an amazing view of the harbor, including the bridge and Opera House.Our unit, a two-bedroom, showed some wear, but it was large and included a great kitchen, laundry, and 2 full baths. It is very convenient to walk to The Rocks, Circular Quay, the Opera House, etc. Secret to avoiding the two blocks of hills walking back from the Quay is to cut through the Four Seasons and go in the back door of the Quay West by the parking garage. This made walking to everything much easier for my 73 year-old mother and 3 year-old daughter.You will not get Four Seasons or Shangri-La service, but room service is fine and you'll have plenty of room to spread out. Contrary to previous reviews, a comparable suite at the Shangri-La or Four Seasons would cost more than what we paid for a penthouse 3-bdr at the Quay West. If you want white-glove service, pick a hotel. If you're a travelling family looking to spread out, I'd stay here. And for postcard quality views day or night, request a room ending in -03 or -04, and above the 25th floor.

<Content>Very Disappointing Upon review of the company's website and its photos, you are led to believe that it is a 5 Star outfit. Having stayed at Quay West Sydney for a week in a two bedroom harbour view apartment, this is very far from the reality. Despite the numerous positive feedback on Trip Advisor, we were very surprised with the poor experience we had in this serviced apartment. The positives:Harbour view (excellent)Proximity to hotspots (close to The Rocks and Circular Quay)The negatives:Extremely poor concierge service (not helpful at all and at times rude)Housekeeping (no attention to detail and at times missed cleaning bathrooms !!)Old and basic furnishings (not of a quality hotel standard and has stains on sofas and cushions)Mediocre room decor (very ordinary and basic)Bathroom (stains around the shower and old ripped towels)Poor air conditioning (either too hot or too cold)Expensive (5 Star cost for a 3 Star establishment, in my view)Small scale operation (asked to settle part of my stay before check out date further indicates low level operation)In summary, if you are merely looking for a view and convenience and don't care about anything else, then this is an OK place to base yourself for a Sydney vacation. However, if you have traveled around a bit and are used to the hotel standard high service levels, then you will be very disappointed. In future, I will make sure that I stick with the household names and will certainly not be staying here again.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel We spent 4 wonderful nights at this hotel. The suite was spacious, well appointed (a washer/dryer was an unexpected delight). We were travelling with a child, and it was a perfect layout. The location was great. Convenient to the Harbour, restuarants and shops. Unfortunately, our view was of the city and not the harbour, which I would definitely request in the future. We would definitely stay there again. Only small negative - the shower stall, while beautiful, was a bit tiny with mediocre shower pressure. But the bathroom itself was spacious and lovely. Overall, it was an excellent experience!

<Content>You really must spend at least one night here I stayed here with boyfriend (who proposed and became my fiance on the last night in this hotel!) and two friends in a 2 bedroom apartment in November 2005. What a fantastic hotel! It's expensive, but not if there are a few of you staying and not if you take into account what you get for your money. The view is literally to die for. You don't get a better view in Sydney, I'm sure. Look at the hotel's website and the photo they show you that represents the view from a harbour view room - that is 100% accurate. The photo could have been taken from our room. None of us looked each other in the face even once the whole 2 days we were there as we were so distracted by the view!Apart from the great view, the room was also excellent. 2 spacious bedrooms, one slightly larger and with an ensuite, one not ensuite but with a bathroom next door. Lounge area plenty big enough, kitchen very well equipped and with Smeg appliances. Laundry room a bonus, with freely provided detergent and conditioner. Decor of whole apartment fresh and modern.Only one bad experience. Got 2 Aussie friends to join us for dinner on our last night - didn't want to waste the view by dining out. Ordered room service which was slow and when it arrived, one meal was missing. Had to chase several times over 45 minutes! for it to arrive so needless to say my poor friend ate on his own. Excuse given was large wedding reception so they were busy; but this isn't good enough. Though they did give us the meal for free in the end plus a bottle of wine which at least shows some idea of customer service.Despite this, the staff in general were nice and obliging. One small tip: don't buy anything in the mini-mart in the basement of the hotel. Most expensive store in Australia! I would have been happy to pay a premium for the convenience (I was buying nibbles and dessert for the dinner). But $6 for a tiny packet of grated cheese! This is horrific but Aussie standards. I paid it anyway but advise you to seek out somewhere cheaper.One final point: don't underestimate how great it is to be in such a convenient location - everywhere easily walkable.A wonderful hotel - can't wait to go back on our honeymoon.P.S. finally remembered the fab top-floor swimming pool. An odd experience swimming a lap directly at eye level with the harbour bridge but definitely worth a try. Beautiful.

<Content>A really great view As a family of four with two teenagers, we all had the best time at Quay West.The apartment was fabulous, the best we stayed in while we travelled.Well equipped, clean and well laid out apartments with delicious food too. Staff were very helpful and couldn't do enough to help. But best of all was the view...really breathtaking at any time of the day. It's worth paying just for the view.Good location too for getting around Sydney- either by walking or catching other means of transport. Quay West was great for us.

<Content>The best view We had a 1-bd aparment with a view of the harbor. It coulnd't be beat. The room was lovely and clean, with a nice bathroom, kitchen and laundry. The service was great. But it's the view that makes this stay most worthwile.

<Content>A Fantastic apartment We arrived in Sydney on the 10th Nov'05, when we booked into our apartment the view that greeted us was out of this world.Our apartment looked directly over the harbour bridge and the opera house. To be greeted by that view every time you enetered the room was fantastic.Very friendly staff,location of the hotel couldn't have been better would definitely stay here next time.
