<Content>Unpleasant odor My flight was so delayed that I got in too late to drive the 100 miles home, so the airline put me up here. I got a room on the 3rd floor facing the parking lot, over the entry. It was nearly 2am. I asked for a fan because I like to sleep with white noise. The desk clerk said they didn't have any. The room smelled very musty, so I opened the window, which was behind a heavy curtain. If the curtain was open there were very bright lights right outside. It was 34 degrees out so it was too cold to leave open, and then I could also hear the sirens. I tried to turn the air conditioning/heater onto fan only and the nob was broken. So I put it on heat but turned it on cooler. The smell seemed to be coming from the air unit, and the hallway smelled the same and it was so late I didn't ask for another room, but wonder if anyone else on here noticed the odor. Also there was a hair under the toilet wrap. Breakfast was dry oranges and hard boiled eggs with invisible shell fragments and orange juice. I think I was already getting sick but had the runs by the end of the day.

<Content>Good for airport. I was put here after being voluntarily bumped off a flight. For an airport hotel, this is all you need. It can't be 5 minutes from the courtesy bus pick up to the hotel door. The service was fast, its next door to a Denny's and a place that does their catering, the gym is cramped, but adequate. The only thing I could've wished for is a hot tub and pool to relax in.

<Content>too expensive for what it is It's clean and the rooms are ok (althought privacy was not really an option in the bathroom with its odd sliding, thin door).The breakfast is below average, more like a super 8 motel type than what you would expect for such a price.It would not recomment this hotel, there are much better, less expensive options.

<Content>close to airport We stayed when arriving  again prior to an early flight on our departure. The first night was adequate  room was clean- just skimpy on towels (and I agree about the shower configuration- knocked the skin off my knee trying to get out)On our return, they checked in another guest under my name. The first clerk said I had to have my confirmation number  I explained we were there 2 days before and I had arranged for a late check. She said she had no rooms! She was accusatory  acted as if I wasn't being honest (yep, that angered me!)The second clerk then came over  said she had double booked another room  had to go verify that no one was in it. We finally got a room  asked for a wake-up call (did not get it).Overall, room is fine, noise not bothersome, continental breakfast better than most  price is fair. We would probably stay there again.

<Content>Okay budget choice in a pinch My family and I stayed in this hotel for one night when our flight was canceled. We were put there by the airline which paid for the stay. The good part is that it's close to the airport with a 24 hour shuttle. There's also continental breakfast, but we didn't eat there. Nothing special about the hotel - definitely a budget option without any extras - checked in at 2 AM and had to check out by 11 AM (no way to extend checkout). I wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Worked well for us Like most travellers who use this hotel, we had an overnight stay before an early morning flight the next day. We used the free shuttle service from the airport, which took a while to come, but only because of the congestion in the pick up zones. We had a room overlooking the airport - an absorbing view. The hotel is so well soundproofed that we were not disturbed by noise at all, from inside or outside.The room was more than comfortable, very clean, nicely decorated. Check in went very smoothly, and all our dealings with the staff were of a high standard. The person on the reception counter was able to attend to the needs of a number of guests simultaneously - she was obviously very skilled and exceedingly pleasant. We had no problems accessing the business room for internet access, and all our enquiries were handled well.A self-serve continental breakfast was available from very early and the range of choices was good - from fresh waffles, cereals, fruit, toast, eggs etc. We were close enough to walk to the airport the next morning, even though we could have used the free shuttle. It took about five minutes to walk, pulling our bags.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel - it was great value for money.

<Content>Very good experience! Stayed on a weekday in a superior room (at AAA rate). Bed was very comfortable, bath was clean, towels  robes thick, refrigerator. Overall, very clean and well maintained room. Hotel borders the runway, but with soudproofing the airport traffic wasn't a bother at all--actually pretty neat to have a front row view of gates A13  A14! Front desk staff was friendly and courteous.

<Content>OK...but not a favorite experience We stayed at this hotel on our last night of our vacation to Washington. The hotel is along a row of hotels directly near the airport. The main complaint I had was on overall friendliness and customer service of the front desk staff. I seemed to be bothering them when I asked them for something. One of the younger ladies at the front desk was constantly talking to her boyfriend and seemed little concerned about my needs. I asked about eating locations in the area and got a vague answer. Later in the evening I asked to get the key to the Business room and the key was almost thrown at me as she was again talking to her boyfriend about getting off of work. The room is fairly average and you do have some airport noise - though not bad. They did take us to the airport and the morning driver was friendlier than most. I would agree with the review of the continental breafast that it was better than most and the waffles were very tasty. If i had it to do over might consider the Red Lion Hotel which is nearby or the Holiday Inn.

<Content>Good place for a short stay I stayed at the Coast Gateway hotel from Feb4-8 08, while in Seatac for Business. The hotel is in Seatac, about two minutes from the Airport and not really in Seattle. Being close to the airport was a plus, but if the noise of planes bothers you, you may want to move down the road a little. My room was facing the street and you couldn't really hear the planes, but I bet it would be a little louder if you were tarmac side. Just a heads up.The hotel was clean and comfortable. No real frills, but not dumpy at all either. The staff was very friendlly. The continental breakfast was nice, but they don't change it up. So after a couple of days it got rather boring.I would recommend this hotel for a short stay and I'd consider staying here again if ever in the area.

<Content>Constantly impressed, time after time!!! We have stayed at the Coast Gateway Seattle well over 2 dozen times since 2002 and have yet to be disappointed.We have found the staff to be friendly, accommodating and most helpful with special requests. With 4 children we must book 2 rooms to accommodate all the bodies and often stay on both ends of our flights (or Mariner games) just to get in a few extra moments of pampering. We cannot say enough about the kindness shown the children and ourselves. The desk staff are quick at check-in/out and room service from the Sharps Roaster Ale House next door is always prompt.The beds are comfortable and the airport noise is practically non-existent. While the bathrooms themselves are on the small side, it functions for the intended purpose. The rooms are spacious, and when staying on the airport side the upper floors offer terrific views of the airport and hours of viewing pleasure if you like to people watch. The bathroom amenities are generous and the bath linens are satisfactory.The morning complimentary breakfast offers fresh made waffles w/ your choice of toppings, yogurt, various breads  bagels, hard-boiled eggs, oatmeal, coffee, tea, a variety of juice options, milk, hot chocolate, apple cider and three choices of cereal. We always walk away more than satisfied and the children look forward to breakfast before flying out.The business center is well supplied and complimentary. Access is controlled by the front desk so there are no children in the way when you need to print tickets or check email. Computers are up to date.Although a pool/ spa would be a nice addition, they offer a small fitness room that has limited equipment that is adequate to get a decent workout.The property offers airport shuttle service and while we have never waited more than 10 minutes to get the shuttle, we have begun to walk to and from the airport just to stretch our legs a little more. The airport doors are only a 7 minute walk away so the location is excellent for a little pre-flight fresh air.The Park and Fly lot is located at Masterpark Lot C, about 1mile north from the property. While it is a little bit of a hassle, the security and service of Masterpark is excellent and well worth the extra time and energy.We will continue to use the Coast Gateway as our primary Seattle area hotel. While we have on occasion stayed at other properties in Seattle, The Coast Gateway is the our preferred option and we have recommended this property to dozens of our family and friends and no one has been disappointed with many returning anytime they travel.

<Content>Stay somewhere else The hotel seems nice when you walk in but the rooms were very tired. The drapes didn't close properly, the popcorn ceilings seemed dirty and a tiny bathroom with a single shower door installed over a tub which receded into a wall making it a very claustrophobic design.The worst though was the cheap lumpy pillows and the turquiose blanket, time to update! The dishwater coffee at breakfast was just horrible and breakfast consisted mainly of white carbohydrates, why not have a bran muffin or whole wheat bread. Also our floor smelled like cigarette smoke even though it was suppose to be a non-smoking floor.Also the garbage bins were emptied at 6 am, not a nice way to wake up.There are lots of hotels around Sea Tac; my opinon is try another one.

<Content>Okay for one night Stayed at this hotel in early October with several business colleagues. The hotel is very close to Seattle airport and offers complimentary transportation. Check in was pretty smooth and the front desk staff are pleasant. The hotel itself is certainly nothing special. The rooms are small, and the shower appears to be nothing more than a stall, however, once you open the door there is a small bathtub. The beds aren't that comfortable, and the pillows are really really tiny (very odd!). Quite cramped however. There is no complimentary wireless internet here ($6.95 charge) which is disappointing. There is a tiny business centre on the 3rd floor which is complimentary. For me, this hotel might be okay if you are stuck at the airport overnight, and will be leaving first thing the next morning. Don't consider this however, for longer than an overnight stay, and only if you need to be right near the airport.

<Content>Won't Stay at any Other Airport Hotel I have stayed at this hotel several times now, the most recent stay on September 6th. You can't beat this hotel for convenience, cleanliness, and service. I liked my first stay so much that I became a Coast Rewards member on the spot, and each night I stay I earn 500 Alaska Air miles. I did learn to ask for a room that doesn't have a connecting door (you never know if the person in the next room snores or tends to talk loud on the phone at 3 a.m.) and that makes all the difference in the world - quiet and relaxing. Of course, this is true for most hotels, never get a room with a connecting door, always ask. The rooms are clean, furniture and bedding in excellent repair, the wireless high-speed Internet access in each room is amazingly fast, there is a mini fridge and microwave, as well as a coffee maker with an ample supply of coffee, etc., and the bathroom is well lit and comfortable with all the items one would need while traveling. You can either have a room facing International Blvd or the airport. On the airport side you would never know you were within walking distance of the jumbo jets unless you looked out the window, good soundproofing.The airport shuttle, I believe, runs about ever 15 minutes or you can go to the front desk and let them know you need the shuttle and they will radio the driver to alert him or her that a guest is waiting. I've never had a problem with this, and the drivers always help me with my bags and are friendly and knowledgeable of the airport - just tell them where you need to go at Seatac and they will make sure you are dropped off as close to the area you need to be as they can get you. During my last visit I needed to catch the Kenmore Air shuttle to Boeing Field to fly to Port Angeles (I live on the Olympic Peninsula) and the shuttle driver drove me right to the pickup spot where the shuttle would be arriving a few minutes later. The front desk staff are courteous, friendly, and very helpful. During my last stay I had arrived on the spur of the moment without a reservation and they had me in their computer system as a Coast Rewards member with my preferences, etc., and quickly checked me in, literally within 2 minutes flat. Non-connecting room, in the corner like I prefer, facing International Blvd. You can't beat that type of service, and they do it with a smile!The room service at this hotel is EXCELLENT. The restaurant next door, Sharp's Roaster  Ale House, provides room service from 11 to 10 PM on weekdays and noon to 10 PM on weekends. They make the best house salad I've ever had, absolutely HUGE for a reasonable price, and it is a complete meal in itself. Their staff is just as friendly and helpful at the Coast Gateway staff, and as a habit when I stay at Coast Gateway I'm on the phone to room service ordering my salad for dinner. All in all, this is the best place to stay at if you need a flight in the morning or have a layover.

<Content>Nice airport hotel In spite of being very close to the airport (walking distance) my room was very quiet. Staff were pleasant and efficient, the room comfortable and clean, the pick up shuttle prompt. Can鈥檛 talk about breakfast because I had to leave before it was served (it starts at 5am). They have a great rate for Alaskans (Seattle is our hub to the outside world). I have stayed here several times and will do so again.

<Content>Excellent airport hotel - great staff This is a great little aiport hotel. Infact its so close if you don't have luggage you could easily walk it - but the shuttle turned up quickly once called. Had we known the area we would have walked to it with our cases after a 9 hour flight - it really is that close.Check in was friendly and welcoming - all the details were just as booked. The room, on the 5th floor, was overlooking the airport but there was no distrubing noise - this is a very quiet hotel. The room was large, well appointed and exceptionally clean. Bathroom was well lit and had everything you needed - no complaints.Breakfast in the morning was very sugary - cereals and danish etc - but good coffee was available and it was served in a small area off reception.I'd recommend this hotel for a quick stay over to anyone. We paid $135 and I think this was good value.

<Content>Great Airport Hotel We were in Seattle for only one night and flew in from South Texas. We wanted a nice hotel near the airport, as we knew we would be in airports all day. Our husband's rode into Seattle on Harley's and we met them at the hotel. Being that we had never been to Seattle, we figured it would be easy for them to find the hotel and for us not to have too long of a taxi ride. The hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful. The rooms were very clean and spacious. Large shower was nice. We had a view of the airport and never found it to be too noisy. The only downfall for this hotel was it's location from downtown. We were told by many locals that if you are in Seattle for only one day, you have to see the Space Needle and Pikes Street Market. The taxi ride from the hotel to downtown was anywhere from $ 30 - $ 40 each way. Being that we made one trip to downtown that evening (Space Needle) and the next morning (Pike Street Market), we spent alot on cab fares. However, if you need a nice hotel near the airport, with no airport noise, this is a wonderful hotel.

<Content>Nice hotel but better choices elsehwere? We chose this hotel for their 鈥淪leep, Park and Fly鈥?package. It turns out they use MasterPark Airport Parking, which we always use. But, you need to drive to the MasterPark Garage before your flight, there is no pick up at the hotel. In retrospect, I don't think we saved much if anything by booking this package.Our room looked out on part of the airport, although it didn鈥檛 seem to be a busy section and we barely heard any airport noise. The room was clean and comfortable.We had dinner at the neighboring restaurant, Sharp鈥檚 Roaster  Ale House. It is in the same parking lot as the hotel and has great beer and food!We asked about staying at the Coast Gateway on our return, but the room rate was $119. We chose to stay at the Holiday Inn Express where the room rate was much less and the room just as nice, if not better! The next time we fly out of Seattle in need a 鈥淪leep, Park and Fly package, we鈥檒l stay elsewhere and use an on-line MP coupon for parking and save money!

<Content>Great Continental Breakfast! GOOD: A suprisingly good continental breakfast was served each morning including a make-it-yourself waffle station and hard-boiled eggs. Furthermore, the rooms were clean and spacious with free HBO. And front staff were helpful with all our questions. BAD: Located right beside the airport so it was occasionally loud. Planes could be seen taxing just outside the room window. The housekeeper knocked on our door to clean the room awfully early in the morning 8AM!! We were still in bed then. I suggest putting the Do Not Disturb sign on the door before you go to bed if you plan on sleeping past 8am. All in all, the hotel was approximately a 10-15min drive from downtown Seattle. But if you don't plan on staying predominantly in the downtown core then the location is great for visiting the Museum of Flight (highly recommended) or Boeing etc...This hotel is good value for your money.

<Content>Cleaning the rooms a bit too early ?? Nice hotel, fabulous breakfast !! Waffles you make fresh,cereal,fruit,yogurt,coffee,tea,toast, etc. but unfortunately at 8:05 (and I was sleeping in that a.m. because I was flying out from Seatac airport which is just minutes away) they were vacuuming right down the hall and you couldn't sleep through it. I asked about this when I checked out and suggested they clean the rooms and hold off on vacuuming until 10 am or so, you can't check in before then, but they didn't think this was an issue. Oh well, won't stay there again if ever flying out of Seattle Tacoma International Airport.

<Content>Not bad for an airport hotel Stayed in this hotel for an overnight in order to catch a early morning flight out of Sea-Tac. This facility is comparable to other Coast properties that I have stayed in throughout British Columbia.Location is perfect. Less than 2 minutes and you are in the Seatac airport parking garage. If you are plane buff, ask for an odd number room so that you can overlook the airport. Our room was so close to the A concourse of Sea-Tac that one could easily see travellers waiting for their flights at gate A-14.The hotel offers a complimentary continental breakfast which was quite limited. If you wish a meal outside of breakfast, that means eating outside of the hotel. Across the hotel's parking lot is Sharp's Roaster  Ale House; good food. Actually this restaurant provides the room service for the Coast.Check-in and check-out was prompt, friendly and efficient. Though a little dated, the rooms were fine. Comfortable, clean and enough space.Overall, this hotel was fine. For Canadian travellers, the Coast Gateway is an opportunity to support a Canadian company.

<Content>Reliable, safe airport hotel We always stay at the Gateway when we have early flights from SeaTac. It is safe, reliable, and the prices are reasonable. Check out the website and pick the Park and Fly option - it is a good deal and the parking facility is the best. Keep in mind, this is an airport hotel so it isn't fancy, but it is clean and it is safe. Many of the hotels and areas around the airport are NOT safe and others are grossly overrated and overpriced (DoubleTree/Red Lion and Hilton). They've added refrigerators and microwaves to the rooms and are in the process of doing more renovations and improvements.

<Content>Priceline overrated this hotel! This hotel was selected by virtue of using PRICELINE[-]. I only stayed here one night with my girlfriend at the tail-end of a trip which included Vancouver, B.C., Canada and Seattle, USA. Our stay was on July 31, 2005.My experiences with Priceline[-] have been mixed. When selecting a 4-star hotel, the quality has been quite good; however, results for 3-star hotels vary considerably. I used Priceline[-] in the USA and was booked into the 4-star Hyatt Regency in Dallas for $70 USD. Great deal. I used Priceline[-] to book while I was in Vancouver, Canada and obtained a price of $75 USD for the Hyatt Regency (good price). These previous bookings on Priceline were for 4-star hotels. For the TWO recent occasions when I booked with Priceline[-] for 3-star hotels, they have both been disappointments. Like several other reviewers of THIS particular hotel (Seattle Coast Gateway Hotel by the SeaTac Airport), phone calls to the hotel to make requests such as my preference to stay in a non-smoking room were treated rudely and no ATTEMPT at accommodation was made. They said disparaging things about Priceline[-] and were basically saying you get what you pay for (which to the hotel staff means bad service for low price).When the front staff noted that my reservation was based on Priceline[-] prices, they were very curt, rude, and unhelpful. They said that they cannot take ANY requests if I booked on Priceline. Frankly speaking, I ended up paying a few dollars more than their regular rate on Priceline[-] based on their bidding process. I recall paying about $90 USD for a one-night stay. Considering this, they still were very unhelpful and rude. You may want to also check out my COMPREHENSIVE TripAdvisor review for the Crowne Plaza Hotel Georgia in Vancouver, B.C., Canada. A similarly poor experience resulted from the front desk seeing a Priceline[-] reservation. You can read my review directly by copy  pasting this URL:http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g154943-d181923-r3816695-Crowne_Plaza_Hotel_Georgia-Vancouver_British_Columbia.htmlThe room quality was more like a cheap motel you see traveling through the middle-of-nowhere in rural areas. The mattress quality was very bad. It was not firm or supportive. I suspect the mattress coils were worn out and the bed needed replacement. The quality of the bed covers reminded me of the cheap blankets they hand out in economy-class airlines if you are taking an evening flight. They were neither warm nor comfortable.The bathroom was fairly interesting as well. The sink was not located in the bathroom. It was located just off the bedroom area. The toilet and shower were in the same (very small) room. While the shower was of the shower in bathtub variety, it was barely even a half-tub. The shower area was very minimal.We literally stayed in the hotel no more than 5 hours that evening as we had to make it back to Vancouver, Canada to make a 7:45 a.m. flight... so we had to leave at 3 a.m. The hotel had no room service at that hour so we had to walk down the street to a 24-hour Denny's Restaurant. While the location of the hotel may be conveniently located close to the airport, the quality of this hotel negated this benefit. I noted that there was a nice Doubletree Hotel across the street from this hotel. It looked much nicer.That hotel name is: Doubletree Hotel Seattle Airport. The downside of booking on Priceline[-] is that you cannot get a refund after your booking is confirmed... otherwise I would have gotten OUT of this hotel!At any rate, while I cannot say that I got to enjoy all the hotel amenities (if there were any) because of the short-nature of our stay, the service we received on the phone before our arrival combined with the very low-quality (1 or 2 star) quality room... makes it necessary to highly UN-RECOMMEND this hotel. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL. You are warned. Kudos  admiration to a previous reviewer of this hotel who choked up the cost and decided to stay elsewhere despite losing his money because of the poor phone service he received prior to his anticipated stay.If booking on Priceline[-], beware of 3-star rated hotels. You probably should try bidding on a 4-star hotel and cross your fingers for a good price. 3-star hotels do NOT seem to treat Priceline customers very well.Thanks for listening and I hope you heed my warnings. AVOID THIS HOTEL.

<Content>Comfortable, quiet stay right near the airport I got this hotel for $75 on priceline and was pretty happy. We stayed there the night before an early flight after a long west coast vacation. I was surprised at how quiet it was- I never heard a plane take off and it's right across the street from the airport. The bed was extremely comfortable. Aside from a few nicks and dings on the furniture and a small bathroom with no air vent, it was a pretty standard 3 star property. One drawback though is the no pool or hot tub - it would have been nice! Free breakfast with belgian waffles was very tasty!

<Content>If using priceline to book, beware! I have not stayed here (nor will I) so my review is limited to the phone calls I endured while trying to work with the hotel desk after getting a priceline room. Their policy according to the front desk is that they will not work with you at all for any arrangements if you use priceline. After using priceline on many occassions, I have always asked for non-smoking rooms and two beds. Even though I know it is not guaranteed, every hotel has always been pleasant and accommodating, until this one. My first call I was lied to and told there were no rooms available for the night we were to stay and we would get what we get. After checking online and reserving the room I wanted I emailed the company asking if there was a better way to handle this. I received no response. On my second call directly to the hotel, I again was informed that there were no other rooms available and that they would not accommodate priceline customers. The next day I called to see if the reservation I made online could be swapped for the priceline room (I would keep the reservation and then cancel upon arrival). The response was more than rude, I was informed that they were definately not full for the night we were to stay but under no curcumstances would they let us have a non-smoking room with two beds. I have since decided to eat the $65 I paid to priceline and book at another hotel that treated us right when we've stayed before-- like the Hilton (service was amazing). Unfortunately the Coast Gateway will get my money for a night I didn't stay but some things are based on principle. Just be careful.

<Content>I did not love it I got this room for $75.00 on priceline, they listed it as 3star or above. I thought it was gross. The room, although clean, was very run down, stains on carpets, AC didn't work and the worst thing of all was that the mattress pad and linens didn't fit the bed. I kept waking up on the mattress...YUCK. The one redeeming factor is an excellent free continental bfast.

<Content>Noisy and old Based on the positive reviews, I booked a stay for a short weekend trip at the Coast Gateway Hotel. I am usually not disappointed with tripadvisor reviews. This is one of the few exceptions. I do not recommend this hotel. I agree that the lobby, dining room, and hallways are pleasant and clean. The breakfast is adequate (enjoyable make your own waffle). However, the room I stayed in was old and noisy (expect 5-6 am wake up calls from dump-trucks). There were cracks in the sink. The cramp bathroom had a shower door that swung outward causing the bathroom floor to get thoroughly wet every time you exit the shower. Because of this, the tiled floor was discolored with mildew. I do not know if the managing staff feels that the customers are just the fly-in/fly-out kinds, and do not feel that there is a need to obtain customer loyalty. Oh well, I am flying into Seatac again next week and will try my luck at another hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed at the Sea Tac location in March 2005.This Hotel exceeded my expectations. There was no airplane noise, the breakfast buffet was ample, I loved the business center, the room smelled good and was clean, the staff was so accomodating. I asked for late checkout and it was not a problem. The decor was pleasing...I would recommed it to anyone!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Great park  The Coast Gateway is my choice for park, sleep  fly at Seatac. They frequently have a $99 special that includes a 1-night stay and 7 days parking. Although the parking is off-site, it is with the best parking facility in the area. Additionally, if you are an Alaska Airlines mileage participant, you can earn 500 points for each night you stay.

<Content>Great Hotel Great, clean, affordable hotel. My daughter loves playing the grand piano in the lobby as she goes into piano withdrawel when we travel. Clean rooms for a great rate, and the staff is exceptionally helpful. We really like staying at this hotel since the airlines can't seem to get us into Seattle at any time other than from midnight to 3:30 AM, and it is very near the airport and easy to find. They were even very understanding and helpful when we were nearly four hours late in arriving after being Dollar-rent-a-cared for most of the night trying to get our rental car. I will NEVER rent a Dollar rental car again, but I will ALWAYS stay at this hotel if I need a place near the airport. Truly great value!

<Content>Fastastic Value and convenient to airport. This reasonably priced hotel was the surprize of our trip. The hotel is located less than a block from SEA-TAC an has 24 hour shuttle. Coast appears to have undergone a recent remodel, and the did an excellent job. Located on International Blvd and next to the airport I was surprized to find that neither the street noise nor air-traffic were loud. Several nearby restuarants, and the hotel had a very good free breakfast.
