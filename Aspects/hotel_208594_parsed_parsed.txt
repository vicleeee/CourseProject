<Content>1 small step above a hostel For the price, I should have just stayed in a hostel. The only advantage was that there was a private bathroom in our room. This hotel is truly a 1 start budget hotel, so you should be aware of that when you book. Its the equivalent of booking a room at a Motel 6 or Knights Inn in the States. Although the pictures on this website make the rooms look ok (and I relied on that), what you cannot see are the moldy tubs and the cracks in the walls. Unlike some of the other reviewers, we didn't get a bottle of Cava nor was it ever offered. Of the three beds in the room, one of them had some gross black dust all of the covers. For the price, which was about $250 for 2 nights/2 people, I felt cheated. Especially, when I heard about a place across the street for nearly the same rate but much nicer accomodations.Like another traveler we had issues getting the heat to work. The front desk assistant came up and showed us how to leave the lights on (because they generally turn off eveytime you leave the room). Even then, the room was never quite heated. In fact it felt very much like an icebox. Additionally, the tv selections were scarce and the remote didn't work. I pretty much slept in my clothes and tried not to let any body part touch the surfaces.On the bright side, the breakfast offered next door was good. From what I hear, it was more hearty than more hotels offer. It included juice, coffee and tea, a sandwich and a croissant. You could also get cereal and fruit to go along with your meal. However, be sure you get breakfast, because after 11:30 the menu price goes up to nearly 40 euro.Another bright side is the location. It was nearly smack dab near everything you would want to be near. Plaza Catalunya was about 1 block away, Las Ramblas about 2-3 blocks away. We walked to just about all of the main attractions and took the Metro to others. The Metro is also right across the street.

<Content>Great experience at the Urquinaona My three day stay at the Urquinaona was great. I arrived after a long flight and was tired. I didn't know how to work the heating in the room and the attendant came up to show me how. Everything worked fine and the bathroom/shower was in perfect running order. The breakfast was adequate, nothing fancy, but it was fine for a complimentary hotel breakfast. The hotel restaurant was also good as I had dinner there one night. The staff were terrific offering suggestions on what to see/do, gave good directions, and helped in whatever way possible. I paid my bill the night before and checked out the next day. A taxi was arrived at the time I specified.I highly recommend this hotel for LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. Good for shopping, catching the tour bus at Plaza Catalunya, and some good restaurants.

<Content>Best 1 star Ever! Was a little hesitant to book this hotel as it was only a one star, however am glad I did. Getting to the hotel from BCN airport was extremely easy as you take the AEROBUS to Pl. Catalunya (under 4 euros), where the hotel is only a short walk away. Check in was easy and we were up to our rooms. The hallways were completely shaddy. The room was a lot better; I was relieved when I saw the room to see it was not as bad as the hallway. Room was clean, the bathroom was in good working order, aircon worked great, and they give you a free bottle of sparkling wine. The view was hilarious鈥? you looked onto someone else鈥檚 apartment, a little awkward to open the window and see some kid playing video games. We also found that long distance calls were extremely cheap. The breakfast was good鈥? for free鈥? it was served in the bar next door. Location was excellent you could walk to tons of places. Front desk was helpful with suggestion. We were leaving for the airport at 3 am and advised the front desk the night before鈥ere told to pay that night as the overnight staff did not know how to use visa, also asked if we could have snacks as we would not be able to have breakfast, which they gladly gave us. Next morning our cab was ready and we were on our way. Excellent location, Excellent value鈥? you forget about everything else.

<Content>Ok....but, when we went to check out.... Two friends and I stayed here for our entire stay in Barcelona. While I didn't mind the hotel for the respite of my stay, although it was very sparse, felt kind of cell-like, and the shower could have been cleaner, I wouldn't have felt like I had a bad experience there until I went to check out. We had to catch a flight for Madrid, and needed to check out at 4:00 a.m in order to do so. The front desk clerks the night before we left said it would be no problem, and arranged a cab to come pick us up. So, I was quite surprised and taken aback when I went to check out with my credit card and the new front desk clerk (who was not who arranged the cab for us) and who looked quite shady, demanded that I pay in cash because he didn't know how to work the credit card machine. He wanted me to go around and get hundreds of dollars out of an ATM in the dark. More than even my bank will let me take out! I was livid to say the least. I explained that I reserved with my credit card, and they could charge it later if they couldn't get it to work at the time. I was not handing over cash to this guy. He kept arguing with me, and wouldn't let me talk to a manager. It felt like a scam. Luckily the cab driver was able to help the guy work the machine, but it was while the meter was running, so we ended up paying more for a taxi, and almost missed our flight. Then I was worried the whole flight back that my card would be charged several times, or that this individual now had my information. It was very unsettling. Luckily, it was charged once, but the worry it caused wasn't worth it.

<Content>Good budget hotel I thought this was a good hotel for the money. It's clean, the staff were helpful and it is very centrally located. I loved having a fridge in the room cause I stocked that with some wonderful ham and cheese shortly after my arrival. I thought the breakfast was very good, and you don't need to get up early as they serve it until pretty late. There is also a computer for internet access which was helpful. Overall, I had a very good stay here.

<Content>good stay It is always a gamble when you book a hotel on-line, but I was very pleased with this one. It had everything we needed, was in a great location and the staff helped out as much as they could. Thanks for the lovely stay in Barcelona (and of course the Cava)!

<Content>Extremely disappointed... In traveling, I have always looked for the bargain...my view is, why spend all that money on a hotel when you are only going to be there to sleep and shower. And until my stay at Hotel Urquinaona, I had never been disappointed with a bargain hotel. Let's start with the pros. The hotel is about five steps from the metro station and you can easily walk to different parts of the city; the water was hot when all three of us took turns showering. Now the cons...the room was by far the tinyest room i have ever stayed at. Literally the three of us had to put our suitcase on our beds in order to be able to open them. Secondly we had a window that faced another building about a foot away, i felt like i was in a cell. The bathroom had no sink space and the tub had mold all over it. We saw some spiders and our last day there we woke up to someone screaming, we still have no idea what that was all about. And at this point i was still ok with the room. The tipping point was what the staff demanded when we left. Let me preface this by stating that the night before we asked to have a taxi requested at 4:00a.m. The staff said it would be no problem and when we booked the hotel we were told we could pay with credit card. Well imagine our surprise when at 3:30 a.m. the staff member states he doesn't know how to work the credit card machine and that we need to walk to an atm and retrieve 450 dollars. The three of us are all young and in our twenties, the last thing we were going to do was walk five blocks in the pitch dark and get that amount of cash. We insisted to speak with a manager since they already had our card number and were still demanding that we go to the atm. The staff member refused to call the manager at home. The cab driver came in and thankfully helped explain that it would be unsafe to walk to the atm and that we could not be expected to have that kind of cash. Luckily the cab driver taught the man how to use the machine, but we ended up having to pay the cab driver for his time anyway because the meter was running. We would never stay here again and we would never recommend it to anyone!

<Content>Great hotel, good location, budget appropriate! My best friend  I met in Barcelona and booked this hotel for the whole stay (89 E. per night). We easily booked it right off the website. When you get off the plane, there's a bus right outside the airport (its a nice bus  it's only 4 Euros) to take you to Catalunya Square  from there its just a short walk to the hotel. Our room was on the 3rd floor, not big, but fine for us. The bathroom was clean, tub, shower, mini-wall hair dryer, etc. And, of course, the big bonus, a bottle of Cava awaited us in the mini-fridge! We drank it on the porch later that night. The only little gripe I had was the bars are open there until 5AM and those kids paarrrttyyy. We like to have a good time, too, but we are in our early '30's and it was just a bit too much. Honestly, we wish we would've gone to Seville or some smaller city in Spain where we could've really enjoyed the food  culture. Barcelona was a very international city, with different languages flying everywhere and it's a very 20-something party town (and $$$). But we still had a good time and this hotel rocked our needs and our budget. The next door cafe was perfect for our (free!) morning breakfast. One last note, don't eat on Las Ramblas!! They'll overcharge you so find the little places (in Born) to have Spanish fare. You all are lucky you have me to tell you what I wish someone told me! :)

<Content>Fantastic location! We were wanting a cheap long weekend away in Barcelona - we began looking for hotels and thought that there was no way we were going to keep it cheap in a good location to view the city. Then we found Hotel Urquinaona!! It was cheap, only one star so we weren't sure. After looking online the reviews were good and so we thought we'd go for it. And we were so glad we did! Its a small hotel with possibly maximum of 12 rooms, everyday each room is cleaned and the linen is changed. Each room has a fridge (which had a free bottle of bubbly when we arrived!), a safe and ours had a balcony!! There was a cafe/bar next door which is where you get breakfast. The tube stop is 2 second walk away and we got the Aerobus to the airport which is in Catalyn Square about a 5 minutes walk away or one stop on the tube. We saw everything by travelling on the tube so what location could have been better?! The people were lovely, very friendly and very helpful. Our flight wasnt until midnight on the Weds but they allowed us to store our bags under the stairs free of charge until we wanted to collect them! We will recommend this hotel to anyone, and Barcelona was beautiful! Thank you very much!!

<Content>Very good location for a Barcelona weekend discovery I've returned recently for a 4 day stay in Hotel Urquinaona.After reading the reviews I thought it was a good choice for a budget weekend even if the one star classification was a little scaring.It was very well located, really near the Plaza Catalunia Square and Las Ramblas. We can walk to the Gaudi's masterpieces and it was really convenient at night to go to the animation of Las Ramblas and Barri Gotic.I've stayed in the 5th floor, with no view for the street, but the room was very pleasant, clean and quiet. We were 2 and we have 3 beds, so no problem of space. The air conditioning worked well, with low noise. The TV was quite small and not all the channels worked well.The breakfast in the coffee next door was good: orange juice, coffee, a bread and a croissant to begin the day.Overall I think it is a good choice for a stay in Barcelona!

<Content>perfect location budget hotel A perfect location for visiting Barcelona. Our room was pretty small, the bathroom was almost as large as the room but there was also a cute little balcony for viewing the street life below.I'd searched the web and using Trip Advisor had seen lots of good reviews for this hotel -- and I agree with other reviewers on the very good points of this hotel.The Hotel Urquinaona offered just what we wanted for a 3 night stay... we were out all day and just dropped into bed each night after tapas and tapas and sightseeing.There was a free wifi connection in the room and a free interenet computer just outside our door as well, plus a free bottle of red wine in the fridge. I've rarely seen a bottle of wine offered in 4 or 5 star hotels and often the more stars a hotel has the more it costs for Internet. Kudos to Hotel Urquinaona for a wonderful stay.Don't be put off by the 'just' one star listing for this hotel.Hotels in Barcelona are pricey and parking even more so. We drove down from Paris so the car needed to be in a parking lot... well, there was a public car park 50 meters from the hotel that cost nearly as much as our room for our stay. This hotel does not have its own parking, but it is a minor point.The hotel staff - on duty 24/24 were very helpful and mutlilingual and the cafe just next door was perfect for breakfast or an afternoon drink though this street side cafe was a bit noisy perhaps, or just a nice city sound. It'll depend on your mood.This is a modest hotel in a big city at a fair price. Yes, I have stayed in bigger rooms for less in France and other countries, but they were way out in the middle of nada, nulle part, nowhere.If you're looking for value for money and don't need a huge room to spread out in, and/or you are not planning on being in the hotel for much more than a siesta or short nights (you'll be in the tapas bars, restaurants, museums, wandering about almost all day in any case, won't you?)... then I do recommend this hotel.

<Content>good location The location is perfect and convenient. It was about a 5-7min walk to Placa Catalunya and las Ramblas. The room is clean and always cleaned in a timely manner. They also serve a substantial breakfast next door. When you make your reservation be sure to request for a room in the front (we did not do this so we got the wall of the next building as a view outside our window) The front desk person that checked us in was friendly and helpful. I am not so sure about the other person as she does not even look at us. Overall a good stay, the best was the location.

<Content>Central location, friendly service My husband and I stayed at this hotel in May of 2006. We are on a budget and did a lot of research on one and two star hotels in Barcelona prior to our trip. We finally decided on this little hotel due to its location, amenities and price of 90 Euros. This small, basic hotel was very centrally located and offered ample room space, a mini fridge with a free bottle of cava (their sparking wine), a full sized bathroom and a balcony overlooking the colorful street below. Breakfast was served in the adjoining cafe every morning and was pleasant and plentiful. The maid service was outstanding and the staff was friendly.One thing we loved about this hotel was the heavy drapes that we pulled across the balcony doors every afternoon for our siesta. They literally blocked out all light and any noise from the street, and provided pleasant surroundings for a much needed daily nap after touring the city and enjoying the nightlife.I would definitely recommed this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona.

<Content>Unbelievable value When I was looking for a budget hotel in Barcelona I found that one. I read the reviews in Tripadvisor and decided to book it. However, I was a little worried because it was a 1 star hotel... Well, it is an unbelievable value. The hotel is located just steps of the Metro, just two blocks from the Plaza Catalunha (so you can come and go using the cheap Aerobus to the airport) and within walking distance of anything you want to see in Barcelona. Now, do you know a one star hotel that has: fridge, TV, phone, free welcome cava (yes free!), breakfast included, hair dryer... I don't. You'll find all of this is the Urquinaona.The only couple of details that do not allow me to give them 5 stars are: the breakfast is served very late (actually is served in a cafeteria right besides the hotel) so I had to miss it both days and the door is man-powered (yes, somebody opens the door for you) and I had to wait a couple of times for that person to come up.Other than that, I highly recommend it.

<Content>Perfectly Located - Hotel Urquinaona was great Hotel Urquinaona was great - we booked this off of other Trip Advisor comments and were very impressed. The rooms were clean and simple - nothing flashy - no great style. The double beds were actually two single beds - which is typical for Europe - so don't be surprised. We stayed in a room at the back of the hotel which did face another building - so not a lot of sunlight - but defintely quiet. However, the real reason to stay at this hotel is the location. Location, location, location. It really was centrally located in between all the things you want to see in Barcelona. Although you are just steps from the Metro - you can walk almost everywhere. In 10 or 15 minutes we walked up to the Sagrada Familia. 5 or 10 Minutes and your down in the Gothic Quarter - a few more streets over and your walking down Las Ramblas. There are fantastic restaruants just a few blocks from the hotel like [Casa Calvet - C/ de Casp 48, Smart. Trad decor. High-end trad food. Gaudi building. Romantic. Expensive] or for a great roast lamb try [Restaurant Asador de Aranda C/ Pau Claris 70, Eixample Derecha. simple decor. Trad simple roasts. Mid-price.] The shopping nearby was also excellent. Lastly, the basic breakfast that was included in the price of the room, we thought was fantastic. Every morning, in the cafe - next to the hotel - we had a cafe con leche with fresh squeezed orange juice, a croissant and a roll with Jamon Serrano (ham)- just writing it makes me want to go back. We couldn't have been happier with a hotel anywhere - especially once you consider the price. We have already recommended it to several friends who will be traveling there soon - and to all who read this.

<Content>Central location - very friendly and helpful service This is a small renovated hotel with a personal service and a good restaurantnext door, where your breakfast is served. It has a nice informal atmosphere and offers free internet and a good free coffee machine in a small lounge on the first floor. And even a free bottle of Cava in the fridge. It is run by young and very friendly people who went out of their way to help us. It is within walking distance to many sights and the Metro just around the corner. I would definitely stay there again. Very good for the price.

<Content>4 Day break in Barcelona Just back after a four-day break in Barcelona. This was our first visit to the city and we enjoyed our time there. There are plenty of interesting sites to visit and there is a very efficient metro and bus service if you do not feel like walking. We stayed at Hotel Urquinaona and although it is classed as a one star hotel we got four star service. The double room was a good size, ensuite bathroom, fridge in the room with a complimentary bottle of wine on arrival! The rooms were spotless and cleaned daily and the desk staff were friendly, courteous and helpful. As well we had a lovely breakfast every morning and this was all included in the reduced rate room offer (around 鈧?50 for the 4 nights) we got through Rates To Go. Barcelona was quiet and many of the restaurants had few customers. However we got great value for money in all the meals we had.The weather was the only disappointment as it rained heavily during two days of our stay. Still we would return to Barcelona but perhaps next time a little later in the year.

<Content>Wonderful I stayed at Urquinaona and was pleased with my service. I was able to practice my Spanish with the front desk and the restaurant next door was about the best restaurant I and my friends enjoyed all around Barcelona. We stayed for about a week and enjoyed every bit of Barcelona. The staff are very courteous and helpful. If I were to come again I would stay at the same place. Location is wonderful! One qualm about the hotel overall was the elevator. But why use the elevator when they have stairs? It seemed at times we would get stuck but I got over it. Well priced hotel and great for starters coming to Barcelona.

<Content>Satisfied I spent 1 night at this hotel with my parents, sharing a triple room. The staff were very friendly and the room was clean. There's free internet access in the hotel, which meant I could still keep in touch with my friends by email, which was nice. I would recommend this hotel to everyone, and I would happily stay there again.

<Content>Great location The location of this hotel could not be faulted - metro on door step, 5 minutes from Las Ramblas, 5 minutes from Gothic area and 5 minutes from main tourist bus stop and shops. It was clean, comfortable and we slept very well (quiet despite being so central). Breakfast was adequate and the coffee ok. (no facilities in room) We could only get Euro Sport in English but who wants to spend time watching tele in this beautiful city?!We were situated at the back of the hotel - in 2 rooms as the door handle came off the 1st one(!) but we were quickly relocated - and my only criticism was that the rooms were very dark as backed onto another building. I love to wake to sunshine so that was a purely personal coment.I would certainly recommend this hotel for cheap, clean accommodation and would happily stay again.

<Content>If you want clean, keep looking... Not so clean...We stayed here based on the recommendations of a CLEAN hotel on this web site, but were very disappointed in what we found. Our room was ready when we arrived at 1 PM Saturday, which was nice. It was MUCH more sparse than how it looks on their web site, but there was so much hair everywhere (in the bathtub, all over the bathroom floor, on the room floor, etc) that we soon forgot about that.When we told the woman at the front desk that our room was not clean, she aksed with some amazement So, you want it to be cleaned AGAIN? We went out for lunch (and to try to find another hotel, impossible on a weekend) and came back several hours later. She said Your room is all ready now, whcih turned out to mean they had removed most of the hair from the bathtub. We ended up on our hands and knees wiping up the floor with paper towels and toilet paper, figuring that a few minutes ugly-work would be worth it for the next few days. The pile we swept up was DISGUSTING! I think they must use a broom to clean the rooms, not a vacuum cleaner, and the glass-like glaze on the tile makes the hair stick to the floor. Otherwise the hotel was unremarkable. Typical stale rools and meat / cheese plate for breakfast on weekdays, good breakfast with semi-fresh pasteries in the bar on weekends. Peeling paint and other signs that this is a true one star hotel. If you want to be close to everything but not in the middle of all the tourist crush, the hotel is well-placed, and from what we read and saw of other hotels may not be over-priced for Barcelona. But be aware that the other reviews here mentioning clean clean clean are not what we found, and we would not stay here again.

<Content>A grown-up, untouristy and very well-located pied-a-terre This worked out wonderfully. It's not fancy, but it's businesslike, clean, and perfectly located. It's situated in a grown-up part of town, not zooey, but completely citified, a world away from the Ramblas. But it's right on top of the metor station, so you can go anywhere. The rooms are large enough, comfortable enough, and completely clean. There's a computer with an open internet connection to check your email The room where the (very acceptable) breakfast is served is cramped and stuffy, but if you have any sense in the world you'll pick it up and take it down  eat it at the tables on the sidewalk in front of the hotel. In the basement is a not-bad-at-all restaurant, on the first floor is a cafe with Barcelona standard ultrajolt coffee and wine in ultrabig goblets for non-tourist prices. This is an expensive hotel town, but the Urquinaona worked out as a bargain. We'd happily go back again -- at the end of our stay, the subway station nearby felt like home, and we knew everyone there.

<Content>Basic but Well-Situated Our first impression was that the hotel was a lot sparer than the internet photos suggested. However, after staying at two other hotels in Barcelona we realized how clean and comfortable our room was for the money. The location is great - just steps from the metro and a few minutes walk to Placa Catalunya. Ask for a room facing the front of the building. If you want a safe, clean place to stay, this is the place for you. If you want luxury, look elsewhere.
