<Content>Enjoyed it About 2 mins walk to beach and casino, excellent breakfast, easy transportation, good service. We booked a suite and was later told that it's a room with 2 double beds. Upgrade is $20 extra. The suite accommodates 4 people nicely, would have been nicer if there is a kitchen. Overall it's been pleasant.

<Content>Great hotel close to the airport We stayed the last night of our vacation here. It was very clean and comfortable. A breakfast is included in your rate (cheese omelet ,sausage,bagels,cereal,yogurt,etc.). There was some airport noise due to how close the hotel is to it. Only a 5 min taxi ride away . Also, a 5 min walk to the Isla Verde beach. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Not bad for a stopover This is a fine location for a quick stopover in San Juan. The clean, nicely furnished hotel is in the Isla Verde tourist district immediately adjacent to the airport, close to several casinos and numerous eateries. People sensitive to noise should try to avoid rooms in Tower A, which is closest to the airport runways and immediately next to a cock fighting arena whose combatants greet the dawn collectively.

<Content>Best Airport Inn Ever! After reading many good reviews, we used Honors points for a free night before a flight back to Texas.This was the best decision we could have made. The front desk staff were all wonderful. When we checked in, we asked for a room with 2 beds rather than one. Not only were we given this change, but we were also upgraded to a suite. The room was immaculate and had every ammenity anyone could want.We used our room towels for the pool  upon heading back to our room, we asked for more towels. The towels arrived immediately after we got to our room. The pool was nice as was the pool swim up bar. We decided to go to Metrapol for dinner (good choice) but we were told by 3 other guests that the hamburgers were the best they had ever had....no exceptions. One guest said that he had been there 3 days and had eaten hamburgers at the pool bar 4 times!We heard a plane when we were in the pool. It did require that we stop our conversation for about 15 to 20 seconds. We did not consider this a major inconvenience. We never heard anything when we were in our room.

<Content>Good for a short time We have stayed at the Hampton Inn a few times before, and it was always only for a night or two before a cruise. The hotel is nice, but I wouldn't want to stay for longer than a few nights, seeing as there's not a ton to do. The location is pretty good, there are some nice restaurants and a beach nearby. The pool is good. You can get food, like burgers and grilled cheese, from the bar near the pool. There's a hot tub too and lots of chairs to sit on.The rooms are pretty good. They have a good amount of space, we could fit our whole family of five in one room, which had two queen beds and we had a rollaway as well. The first time we stayed here we had a nice view of the pool, the second time we had an ugly view of the parking lot, but we didn't mind much.Breakfast is great. It's free and a buffet is set up so you can get your breakfast in the lobby. They have coffee, cereal and fruit as well as some hot food like sausage and eggs, as well as toast. For other meals you have to eat at the bar by the pool or go to a nearby restaurant. The location was good here, because it was just a short walk to the beach and many restaurants, however it was very close to the airport as well, which is both good and bad. Good because it doesn't take long to get to the hotel, but bad because there are always planes passing by so it's quite noisy. I would recommend this hotel if you need somewhere to stay for a short amount of time before a cruise, or if you don't plan to do much on your vacation.

<Content>A first class concierge experience... My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights and 6 days during our honeymoon. From the moment we arrived we felt welcomed  taken care of. Everyone at the front desk was willing to go the extra mile for us, whether it was Diana finding us a last minute massage or Omar recommending the perfect romantic restaurant. They would always strike up a conversation and ask us about our stay. After reading all the rave reviews we chose this hotel to see if it would live up to the expectations but it exceeded them. Apart from the excellent service, the hotel is well maintained and beautiful (not like the enormous resorts near the beach). It has a very personal feel to it.My wife and I would recommend this hotel to anyone. We can't think of one negative thing to say. Enjoy!

<Content>Excellent choice Very clean and comfortable. While not on the beaches, on a very convenient (cheap and comfortable too) bus line and very convenient to the airport.We didn't use the pool as we were only there for one night, but it looked clean and inviting.The staff was some of the most friendly and accommodating I've seen. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Nice place to stay before a cruise I stayed at the Hampton with my wife, my son and his wife the night before our cruise left port. Other than the double beds being a bit cozy, we had a good stay here. The breakfast in the morning was good and the front desk personel were very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Good for a stopover We had booked a one-night pre-cruise stay at the Caribe Hilton, but after I read about the resort taxes at PR locations with casinos, I decided to explore less-expensive options. Traveling with two young children and likely exhausted from a long day of travel, I knew that we were primarily after a place to crash. So after reading some rave reviews of the Hampton Inn, we decided to give it a try. The price was still high since we were traveling during peak time, but about $100 cheaper than the Caribe Hilton overall.The hotel is well-kept, but it is definitely modest and showing its age. The pool area, about which I'd heard raves, is very small and noisy from the nearby airport. We weren't looking for a day in the sun, but just the time we spent on the patio eating dinner was enough to take us back inside for the rest of our stay. Many families seemed to be enjoying the outdoors a great deal. Happily, we really didn't hear any air traffic inside our room.We had a suite with two queen beds and a study, which was just right for the four of us, giving us a little bit of room to stretch out. The room appeared to be clean, with the nice Hilton linens. The hotel staff was very friendly, even at 3 a.m. when we had to request fresh linens and towels after one of our children was sick. The gentleman who delivered these items refused any kind of tip.The grill by the pool had been a major selling point for us, and we weren't disappointed. The sandwiches -- burgers, grilled chicken, and others -- were fresh and juicy and delicious and reasonably priced. It was nice to have a tasty, hearty meal without leaving the hotel property. We would have been tempted to try the swim-up bar if not for the airport din. The free breakfast the next day was typical Hampton fare (identical, in fact, to the breakfast we'd had two weeks previously at a Hampton in Frostburg, Md.), but did the job for us quite nicely. We did not have much of a chance to explore the neighborhood, but we were told that the El San Juan extended casino privileges to Hampton Inn guests, so that could be a selling point for those interested in more of a vacation. A pharmacy across the street proved to be convenient when we needed OTC medication. Next door, however, were cockfighting arenas. Overall, I can't see spending more than one night at the property. It was hardly a vacationer's paradise or more than an appetizer to the beauty of San Juan -- just a convenient place to lay our heads for a night.

<Content>not too close in, not too far away Location was perfect. Far enough out of the craziness of San Juan that we could relax but close enough that we could get there for the fun. The hotel was very nice, the pool and lobby areas were beautiful. The rooms were a bit worn down but were very roomy and comfortable. The hotels across the steet had casinos for fun and the beach was about a two minute walk away. The hotel had a nice grill/snack bar at the pool and there were several restaurants within walking distance. The airport is so close that the planes are loud out by the pool but you really couldn't hear them in the room.

<Content>Kudos to the Hampton Inn, Carolina, P.R. Over the last several years, it has been our rather distinct pleasure to spend part of our winter holiday at the Hampton Inn  Suites in Carolina, P.R. The hotel is most appealing from an aesthetic point of view as well as for its optimal location. It is easy to make day trips to various parts of the island. The individual guest rooms are most comfortable and serviceabe, and the common areas are attractive and spotless. A home away from home is more than just a location or an environment. It is a whole package that leaves a lasting impression. Every person at the Hampton from the owner to the manager to the desk personnel, the maids, the cleaners, maintenance and pool personnel and the breakfast and grill staff are always there to offer service with the proverbial smile. We have observed many courtesies extended to guests, over the years of our stay. Most recently, a rather tragic incident which ocurred off property, on a scuba expedition, was handled with great compassion, kindness, understanding and efficiency by the entire staff. One would have to look far and wide to obtain a full package as we have experienced over the years. Manager Gary Wallace and all of the staff are to be commended for all of their efforts. We feel like family when we are at the Hampton. We look forward to our continues stays at this most welcoming residence.Lawrence R. BologneseThomas M. Trevisani, Jr.

<Content>Worst Hampton in All of the America's I am a Hilton HHonors Diamond Member with more than 100 stays per year at the Hilton Hotels, this hotel was the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at, the place seemed like it was from the 1960's, the beds were horrible, the staff's attitude was very conflictive, this hotel should be priced at around $59 per night and not at $189. What a disgrace to Conrad Hilton; the pool, the carpet, the paint, the beds; were all dilapidated. My family and I decided that after a few days, it was time to move on, at which point we advised the hotel and they were insulting by saying Well, guess its time to go home, because Puerto Rico is expensive, and I responded with NO, we are moving to a real hotel, like the Embassy Suites; once we arrived at the Embassy Suites, the hotel manager personally took care of us and gave us the Diamond Member treatment. For a difference of only $20, our family was able to recuperate from the dreadful mistake of staying at the Worst Hampton in All of the America's. This hotel is probably ok for the flying crew; as they are only in for a night, but not for families. My kids had a wonderful time at the Embassy Suites with a Cascading Waterfall and water toys to pass several hours; also the breakfast and food was far superior to anything served at the Hampton. At the Hampton, the cafeteria or area serving food, closed at around 9p.m., what a disappointment. No more stays at Hampton Inns, neither in Puerto Rico nor anywhere else.

<Content>Great Stay Just returned from a quick trip to PR with mom to celebrate her 60th. Love the place and the people. We took a jr. suite facing the pool. We had 2 double cloud 9 beds and a large tv in the bedroom. A nice kitchen area with sink, coffee maker, microwave, and mini frig. We also had a living room with couch, chair, desk/table with 2 side chairs and a large tv. All was clean and very nice. Continental breakfasts w/ 2 hot items (eggs/sausage) were provided until 10 am and coffee/tea provided 24 hours. The breakfast made it easy to get our day started without figuring anything out.Pool and jacuzzi are nice with fluffy towels provided.Staff is friendly - recommending buses, restaurants and even having a few menus on hand. Location is very convenient to the airport and you can walk to the beach in a few minutes (ask staff where best beach is since access is limited due to private bldgs and homes). If you take public bus route A5 into Old San Jan as we did expect at least a 1/2 hour ride with a close up experience to PR and its wonderful and warm people.Great restaurant deli across the street - I know it looks like a diner but it is good. Metropol on the other side of the cockfighting arena next door had wonderful cuban fare and drums located in the Isle Verdre mall (2 o'clock from the Hampton front door) had a wonderful red snapper special as well as PR appetizers.

<Content>Good Place to Stay for the Night Before Your Cruise We stayed at the Hampton Inn, San Juan for one night before our cruise in November 2007.The property was clean and well kept. Since we arrived late we had dinner  drinks at the pool bar....the food (and prices) were very good.They provide a free buffet breakfast in the morning (average), but be warned....when they say it's served until 10:30.....they mean it. We noticed the staff waiting at the breakfast area 5 minutes before the end time and by 10:30 everything was gone.....so don't be late.The staff was very helpful.They have a business room with free internet  computers/printers.On the negative side....the property is not on the beach. Also you're directly across from the airport......at the pool bar it was very noisy.

<Content>Nice place; comfy rooms; close to beach! After a cruise of the southern caribbean, my husband, son and I needed a place to stay for one night because our flight didn't leave until the following day. I used my hilton hhonors points to book a night at the Hampton Inn in San Juan. First, they aren't kidding when they say it is close to the airport. I believe they are just off one of the runways. A few times, when we were at the pool, the noise from the jets taking off was deafening--drowinging out all other noises at the pool. But it didn't stop us from getting a good night's sleep. The windows are sound dampening, not sound excluding, so you will hear the jets. You just won't hear them as loudly. Second, the pool is nice. it was cold the day we were there, as was the jacuzzi. But it was refreshing. We ate at the bar by the pool which was a little expensive, but the food was great (grilled right in front of you). Third, the beach is just down the road. Maybe a 3-5 minute walk. It was a nice area of public access (all beaches are public in Puerto Rico) and not too crowded on a Sunday. Fourth, it is within walking distance of quite a few restaurants and a grocery store. If we had stayed longer, I'm sure the grocery store would've come in very handy. The people were very nice--the breakfast was okay--and the place was clean. The only problem were some not-so-pleasant smells. Our room smelled musty until we had the air conditioning on for a while. And the hallways smelled like, well, I'm not sure what, but we just walked quickly and got away from the smell. I would stay there again--although not necessarily for a long period of time. For an overnight, it was just fine.

<Content>Not Bad, not great, nice location The stay at this hotel was only over night for a flight connection the next day. It is a short $10.50US taxi ride from the airport. Check in was easy, staff is helpful. The room was a pool view suit on the ground floor. In general very old and tired looking, warn and stained carpets, but clean otherwise. Entry is into an office/living area with TV, desk, sofa etc. cable internet hookup worked easily. Sink, coffee maker area. Then the bathroom and closet area in a hallway towards the bedroom. Bathroom supplied with plenty of towels, shampoo, conditioner etc. blow dryer, the usual. Closet had extra pillows, an iron and I don't think it had a safe. Bedroom had a TV and comfy beds with down comforters. Walk to the beach is barely 5 minutes. The beach was mostly deserted in late afternoon, very pretty beach but the small waves looked muddy, maybe recent rains? It looked like you could rent chairs and umbrellas and jet skis at kiosks.Meals at Lupi's, a short walk up the street from the hotel, were wonderful for lunch and dinner and the karaoke was fun to watch.Poolside at the hotel, folks were having fun at the bar, I only tried the Jacuzzi which was barely warm and I was let down by that since I love a good warm Jacuzzi. Air traffic noise was VERY loud pool side, but not to be heard from the rooms.Breakfast buffet was standard fare of decent coffee, rolls, cereals, juices, toast, fruit. This is where you see all the flight crew.Check out easy, no hidden charges, taxi's right outside and ready.On my return trip, I got a MUCH less expensive and MUCH better room at the Radisson using priceline.com

<Content>look no further This hotel has to be a sleeper. We have stayed in San Juan on 4 previous occasions over the past 10 years prior to cruising and this is by far and away the best hotel we have experienced. Not only is it less expensive than where we stayed in the past, the rooms (suites?) are larger - about 500 sq ft if you choose a poolview room - the entire hotel is spotless, it's within walking distance from many restaurants, other hotels, car rental agencies, and the beach which incidentally we don't think is that good. The modest comp breakfast satisfies, the burgers at the pool bar are super and the airport noise is a non issue in the rooms due to excellent double paned windows. Forget the over pricing at the hotels with casinos on the beach, you can walk to 3 of them from the Hampton and it's more comfortable.

<Content>Bravo, Cudos, Triumphant, Tour de Force...!!!! We arrived at 4:15 a.m, although our check in wasn't until 3Pm we were permitted (with two teens and an 8 year old) to lounge by the pool and enjoy the continental breakfast at 6 while they stored our luggage for us. The staff was extremely pleasant even at midnight when we had to request a roll away bed, they delivered with in 15 minutes. We were able to relax poolside after a long trip in peace and quiet as we indulged in treats from poolside bar and restaurant. Our room was clean and spacious, even with the extra bed. Being English speaking only we found it very easy to communicate with everyone on staff and it seemed they all went out of their way to understand us. We were steps away from the beach and could smell the ocean from the court yard. Everyone of us enjoyed our stay and would absolutely return to the Hampton Inn when ever in Puerto Rico.

<Content>Perfect stop pre-approved by the flight crews! Perfect stop pre-approved by the flight crews! Stayed one night, Oct 6. Arrived early enough to enjoy the clean pool and tasty poolside grilled lunch of cheeseburgers and fries prepared to perfection, a bargain at $8. No South Beach diet, but we were on vacation. True, during the day the jets landing on the adjacent runway will momentarily shake your bones, but they don't fly at night. Took a cab to the fabulous (by any standard) Plaza las Americas Mall for the highest quality shops we've seen anywhere in the continental U.S., with better prices, too.The Hampton Inn rooms are spacious, safe and clean with very comfortable beds and all bedclothes are washed daily. Windows are double-paned to reduce noise, but I would request a room on the left wing as you face Reception farther from the runways if you want to nap during the day. Really, at night the noise is not a problem. The airlines would not put their crews there unless it was clean, safe and quiet and a good price close to the airport. Also, 2 blocks away is a fabulous, free, white powder sand beach with gentle waves, possibly the best beach we've ever enjoyed. This place could be a destination unto itself. Lots of good restaurants within safe walking distance. Prefer this to Old San Juan any day.

<Content>Nice and clean It's above my expectations. The hospitality of the staff, the cleaness of the room, close access to the beach. We got it with points. Can't comment on the price. The cab drive cost $11 to the SJU. $15 to old San Juan.

<Content>Great hotel, great people! My husband and I stayed at the Hampton Inn  Suites, he was working, I was on leisure. What a beautiful place to be and the staff was wonderful, so friendly and helpful. Housekeeping was excellent, everything was so clean each day. We loved the grill at the pool. They have delicious food and at a good price. The breakfast buffet in the morning was wonderful. There was something different each day. I appreciated the laundry and the computer room. We would go back any time.

<Content>Very impressed with hotel and staff The staff was friendly and helpful when it came to tips about San Juan. Breakfast was decent, the pool area was very nice (with a couple of submerged barstools in the pool for the swimming and drinking crowd). The only negatives were the airplane noise in the pool area (not a factor in the room) and the $20 taxi ride to old San Juan. This is a good place to stay with kids because of the nice, no-deep-end pool and the availability of suites with a separate living area (the suites are much nicer than the standard room - we stayed in both). No pay-for-view movies though - only regular cable with HBO. Very good italian ice cream place open late just across the street (they also serve diner food).

<Content>Exceded our expectations. We stayed at the hampton Inn after our first choice hotel in San Juan the Embassy Suites was full. A bit apprehensive beacuse the proximity to the airport, no noise on our room facing the airport. the food at the pool is absoltly delicious and well price. The $5.00 parking is the cheapest in San Juan. The staff was friendly and helpfull. The continental breakfast was plentifull. Like other hampton suites this location do not have happy hour...Overall a great location for the price. It will definetly be our second choice of hotel in San Juan.

<Content>Good Location Stayed here 2 nights in February 2007. This hotel is about 100 yds from the airport runway. Lots of noise from the jets as they take off. The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. Has coin operated laundry a plus when traveling with small children. Lots of fast food places nearby. A bit far from Old San Juan and the Ports (15-20 min drive depending on traffic), but I believe there was some sort of public transportation available. The continental breakfast was included, juice, muffins,toast some cold cereal. Overal not a bad place to stay for a night or 2. Swimming pool was small but has a hot tub and a swim up bar.

<Content>Superb Service - Very Clean I was more than impressed with this hotel during our recent visit. The location is very convenient to the Isla Verde area, the airport and highways. Although the hotel is not on the beach it is an easy walk (about 3 blocks). Several great restaurants in the area that are not too expensive - you have to look around and stay out of the big beach front places if you are on a budget. We upgraded to a suite and it was well worth the extra money. The rooms were very spacious. Bed and linens were beautiful and the housekeeping was immaculate. This hotel is a great option if you are new to San Juan and especially if you have a rental car - easy parking for only $5 per day. The front desk staff was the most friendly of any hotel I have ever stayed. They accommodated all our requests and gave great directions and were just really nice. I saw some other properties in the area - they were either much more money than the Hampton, or looked run-down and dirty. We enjoyed our stay so much, we extended for 2 additional nights. Only complaints: Pool has too much chlorine and made us cry, sound of the landing airplanes is annoying - but I never travel without my ear plugs. Hey, its is 5 minutes to the airport! You will hear some planes. But overall - this hotel is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

<Content>Good Value  We stayed here one night post-cruise.Friendly attentive staff. We arrived at 11am expecting to check luggage and come back later. Instead, they gave us our room!Small pool with a swimup bar serving excellent burgers and sandwiches.Airport noise IS annoying at poolside.I would not recommend this hotel if you are looking to spend several days relaxing by the pool. Would recommend for a night or 2 on the way through San Juan.Expensive to go to old San Juan via taxi - $25 or so.Could use city bus to Old San Juan which comes by frequently but would require 45 minutes of travel time each way.Nearby beach (3 block walk) is average. Go to beach a bit east of this location past ESJ towers, not directly from hotel (where a storm sewer possibly contaminated with real sewage drains).Room was clean and beds were fine. Bathroom was slightly in need of refurbishing though cleanand fully functional.We were in a 3rd floor room toward the main entrance side and facing away from the airport. There was no airport noise in our room.For the price and staying a night or 2 you won't be a bit disappointed. For a longer stay in this neighborhood, I would recommend the nearby Embassy Suites (stayed there 3 nights - nice pool which is much quieter) or Holiday Inn (looked at but didn't stay there).

<Content>Very Impressed We stayed at the Hampton Feb. 16th  17th 2007. We couldn't have picked a nicer Hotel. The rooms were very clean and updated. The king bed was incredible. Very high quality mattress and pillows. The manager and staff were very accomodating. We enjoyed the pool area and bar. The complimentary breakfast hit the spot in the morning. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and we will definately stay there next time we go to Puerto Rico.

<Content>Great Hotel Experience The hotel is located across the street from major hotels along the beach. The front desk personnel were great. Breakfast was a continental style breakfast but good enough to get your day started. The hotel and hotel room were clean. The hotel is located next to the airport. We felt safe walking in the area until 3am. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel - better than any Hampton I think this is the nicest Hampton Inn we have stayed at. We paid in the mid 250s because everything was booked Presidents's Day weekend, but we were totally pleased with the hotel. I had previously stayed at the Hilton Caribe and really liked that - its a better location for getting to Old Town - but the Hampton is opposite the street from the Ritz and other hotels, allowing more access to restaurants, casinos, etc. The hotel is very clean (far more so than the four star El Conquistador Resort, for example!) and the beds are as good as the best Westin beds. The breakfast is an actual hot breakfast, plus so many other choices of cereals, juices, breads, and bagels, fruit, yogurt, granola, etc. - better than most Hampton Inns. The rooms were quite, the pool looked nice (we did not use) and the staff were helpful. I highly recommend this hotel over many four star establishments in Puerto Rico!

<Content>Really liked this hotel My boyfriend and I booked the Hampton Inn for 2 nights pre-cruise. We were very happy with this hotel. The price was much cheaper than most other hotels in the area. Though the area is expensive as a whole. The hotel was clean, the bed was very comfortable, the breakfast was better than adequate, the pool bar area  grill were very nice also. The burgers are huge and juicy. We walked about a block or 2 to Isla Verde beach which was very nice. We also took the bus into Old San Juan. You catch it out front for .75 cents. I would not suggest it. Pay the extra money and take the cab. The bus was packed wall to wall people and the driver had people flying all over the place because he drove crazy. It also took triple the time as the cab ride home. We waited at least 30-40 minutes for the bus to pick us up also and the locals told us that is the norm because the drivers get paid either way so have no incentive to be on time.We did not have any problems with air conditioning in our room. Ours worked very well. It was freezing in the room. We also had no problems getting pool towels. They had an area at the pool whee u get get towels/dispose of towels. The grill outside does run out of things (certain beer,etc) but we just chose something else then. All in all we had a very good time here and would stay at the Hampton Inn again.

<Content>Very Comfortable We were here for one night post cruise just to relax and we were delighted with the service and amenities. Wireless internet is a plusafter being without for a week. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The location was decent just a two block walk to the beach and the main street. The beach was very nice. Would stay here again especially for the price booked with hotwire.

<Content>Nice Hotel with a Few bumps We came into Peurto Rico late and had previously booked another hotel. The hotel we had chosen was not going to work so we called a travel agent and she booked us at the Hampton. The first three nights our air was not working and we had someone come and fix it however it did not work. The phone in our room was also out of order. They had attempted to fix it but that did not work. We had a wedding to attend and we called again about the air and someone from the front desk came up to see that it was very warm and went ahead and switched us to a new room. We were late to our wedding due to switching rooms 2 hours prior to the wedding. The pool was a beautiful place to be. The airplanes were loud but tollerable. However people were constantly having to ask for towels. The bar by the pool had wonderful burgers available all day. On our third day the bar ran out of Corona, Nanchos, limes, and Medalla. This to me was frusturating. Some people go on vacation to sight see and others go to lay pool side and soak up the sun and just be free of a schedule and with these luxuries missing that is not easliy accomplished. The hotel was a very nice place to stay and I would recommend it. I feel that they really need to be more orgainized and on top of things after all you are not spending $1900.00 for two beds and a nice shower. We were compt one night and a rollaway bed. To me that is just not right when they clearly say Hampton Inn 100% Gurantee.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location We stayed at this hotel at the last minute when we missed our cruise ship out of Fort Lauderdale due to flight delays. We were flown to San Juan where we spent 3 nights until our ship arrived there. It was a last minute scramble to find a hotel and not knowing the area--but knowing Hampton Inns--I booked with them and was happy to see that this property is just like the others we've stayed at. I don't know why this is considered a 2* property, it should be at least 3 IMHO. The front desk stafff were pleasant and helpful, the pool area was great and the rooms were clean. The signature beds were a most welcome comfort after a very long and stressful traveling day. The location is close to some great restaurants, beaches and casinos. Unless you're looking to stay in Old San Juan, I would highly recommend this hotel. San Juan hotels are generally expensive but at $229 this was a bargain.

<Content>Great choice! We booked the Hampton Inn for a pre-cruise stay on the basis of recommendations on Trip Advisor and we weren't dissappointed. The king size bed was wonderfully comfortable, air conditioning fully functional, the room clean, quiet, and nice looking. The staff was fantastic --from check-in to tour arrangements to holding our bags for half a day while we did a pre-cruise tour of El Yunque. The food from the poolside bar was very good and the noise when outside, though loud, not overwhelming. We got a rate of $146 through Hampton's web site and felt that we definitley got our money's worth. For a pre/post cruise stay you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal!

<Content>One of the better values in San Juan We stayed here prior to a cruise as we had last year.Following our earlier stay I gave a generally positive review of this hotel (on February 13, 2006) except for the malfunctioning air conditioning unit for which we were given a suitable adjustment (we were compted).No such problem this time as every thing was fine, No airport noise in the room, the pool was great, the area has a lot to offer as far as restaurants etc. This is not a fancy hotel , but a Hampton INN and one of the better ones at that. One criticism I have is the price of ALL of the hotels in San Juan which have been creeping upward in each of the past 5 years I have been visiting San Juan. I believe an AARP rate of $200 is too expensive for this hotel just as the $300-$500 rates are too expensive for the fancier hotels nereby that were in the $200 plus range only a few years ago..

<Content>One of the nicest Hampton Inns! I enjoyed everything about my stay at this Hampton Inn. The room was very comfortable, and the amenities were terrific. The room thermostat could be programmed to the precise degree. Continental breakfast was plentiful, coffee was available all day. Beds and pillows were fantastic. I even liked the hotel's black and white graphics.If you don't have a car and don't enjoy the city bus, it can be a bit expensive to get around, because Isla Verde isn't within walking distance to many of the places to see. [We dealt with this by staying a few nights at the Hampton Inn, a couple of nights in Ponce, and the rest of the time in Old San Juan]. But try the Metropol restaurant on the other side of the cock-fighting (!) stadium next to the hotel -- terrific food, and you can watch the turtles in the pond outside the restaurant's glass window. Plato's was pretty good, too, if a bit loud. The ice cream place next to Plato's is enjoyable as well.

<Content>Great hotel We were in San Juan for a quick overnight prior to a week at Palmas del Mar. The Hampton Inn on Isla Verde Ave is close to the airport, and within walking distance to the Intercontinental/Casino and several restaurants. It is a clean hotel, very comfortable rooms and fabulous bed. Cool. quiet. nice pool. Clean bathroom, great shower. Highly recommend.

<Content>Convenient, clean, cute We wanted to stay near the airport since we were arriving late at night and leaving the next day to drive around the island. Since the Hampton Inn was near the airport, we decided to stay there. After we checked in, we saw our flight crew arrive and check in too. The lobby was really cute, with great colors, artwork, table and chairs - it was not like any other Hampton Inn we've stayed at. Breakfast included ham and scrambled eggs (in formed patties) and were good for making a scrambled egg sandwich. My friend had a hamburger at the grill by the pool and said it was one of the best hamburgers he has ever had. There is a city bus or trolley that stops out front to take you to Old San Juan.The rooms were clean and although a bit on the small side, included a desk, armoire with TV, a chair and ottoman and a king size bed. Every now and then, you would hear a plane fly over, but I did not find the noise annoying. We would have been happy spending several nights here.

<Content>Everything I needed ie: One Stop Shopping Stayed at the Hampton for three nights prior to my cruise on Sept 3rd. Even though the Hampton is close to the airport, not one person at the establishment seemed to mind.First night was quiet, with my husband (got married on the cruise) and I became aquainted with surroundings. We arrived at noon and our room was ready. Even though we had a view of the parking lot and nearby cock fight stadium this did not damper our enthusiasm. The room was great. Clean, king size bed, decent furnishings, safe, ironing board, and toiletries in the bathroom. Watch out for the AC or at least adjust it as our room was ice cold all the time.Staff was nice, and we even got a welcome call. Speaking of which 800 # calls  local calls were free and so was wireless internet and use of the business center downstairs for printing and web surfing. Pool was sufficient and stayed crowded after the first night with kids, and adults frequenting the swim up bar. The Hampton is across the street from a small strip mall., where I was able to do my nails (for the wedding) and purchase other essentails for the trip. ATM around the corner from the strip mall and if you tired of the free breakfast at the Hampton a Denny's was just feet away.Good resturaunt that locals and tourists alike is right next door (The Metro.....??) and cabs are stationed outside if you want to go Old San Juan. Hotel was able to arrange tour of Rain Forest, El Yunque and despite the rigourous hiking, the tour was the highlight of our stay there.

<Content>Feel welcome in San Juan We booked this Hampton from San Juan airport (we had run from Tropical Storm Chris on 1st August for international flights next day) and arrived there lacking toiletries, lap top cables and some first-aid items. Not to worry, all were provided by the very friendly and helpful front office staff. I was amazed that they were able to produce a Sony Vaio cable within five minutes, that is excellent service. There was an excellent business centre in its own air-conditioned office - good computers, a copier, phones and free internet access. Unusually for Hamptons, this one had a nice little bar in the lobby area. Highly recommended.

<Content>Great Place to Stay!! LOVE IT! Very clean, beautifully decorated! New carpets. Pool is nice, the grill by the pool is good. It's within walking distance to a bunch of restaurants and pharmacy. The supermarket is around the corner, just a short drive, which was very convenient. The breakfast was great, a slight change every day, everything was fresh and tasty. Our only complaint is that it's so close to the airport so you hear them when they take off (in rooms too).

<Content>Airport Hotel This was a very nice hotel for a quick family stay. We were there one night and it was perfect for a one dayer to see Old San Juan, enjoy a nice hotel room, use the pool and have a good breakfast. The place was clean and well maintained. Only draw back was that it was a bit noisy, as the hotel is located right at the end of the runway for the airport, so every time a jet takes off you know it.

<Content>Okay hotel This hotel if it had been on the beach would have been excellent. The hotel for the price is a great value. The people could not be any nicer. The breakfast in the morning was good value but boring by the end of the week. They did not have a nice restaurant on the premises, just a grill by the bar that grilled really good burgers. On other reviews people said the plane noise was not bad, But if you were sitting out by the pool it was very loud. Could not hear the planes in the rooms. We did a lot of day trips and the location was good since it was right off the highway. Was not very convenient to get to the beach. They said one block, but it was a long walk. I noticed that this hotel is used by a lot of airline personnel. It is reasonable in price and close to the airport.I personally would not go back to this hotel again and cannot recommend it if you are going to Puerto Rico and want a realxing hotel overlooking the water. However, Hampton Inn did do there best with what they had to work with.

<Content>Great hotel, Loved it !!!! Best rates This is a GREAT HOTEL !!! Excellent Value for the money, not too pricey ! My Family and I stayed here post cruise for a couple of nites, staff is helpful, the rooms are of good size,the continental breakfast is GREAT (better than expected). I would definitely stay here again. There's a swim up bar  grill, FREE INTERNET SERVICE w/office supplies if needed,restaurants  entertainment within walkin distance 5 minutes (churchs chicken, subway, ponderosa, burger king, wendy's, Ruth Chris, casino, cockfight arena, small grocery store), 5 minute walk to the beach. If you have children that's great too, but not for more entertainment do an excursion while you're there  sightseeing !!! The closet beach is not for kids, the waves are big and the sand swells with each wave, try another beach. The beds are comfortable as well, we had 2 Dbl bed room, nice and comfy for 4 people.

<Content>Great Business-class Hotel, Good Location The hotel was very clean, the staff was friendly, and every was exactly as I expected for this class of business hotel. Traveling on business, internet access was important and the in-room access was fast and reliable. There is also a small business center with internet-connected computers for those who aren't traveling with laptops.The location is convenient, with plenty of restaurants a short walk away - be sure to try the excellent Cuban restaurant next door to the hotel. There is a small market a five-minute walk away where you can get drinks and snacks if you don't want to plug change into the vending machines. There is also a drugstore across the street.The planes may be loud at the pool, but my room was very quiet with the air conditioner on.Like other Hampton Inns, there is a free breakfast, but this one offered food a step above some other Hamptons. The main breakfast entree one morning was a half-bagel topped with egg, cheese, and bacon - it tasted like something you would find in the supermarket freezer section, but better than fast food. The next morning was French toast and sausage, which was decent; more akin to a Shoney's buffett than a home-cooked meal, but it comes with the price of the room, and there was plenty of fruit, yogurt, cereal, and other breakfast foods. If you don't like it, you can walk to Denny's across the street or one of dozens of other high-priced restaurants in the neighborhoodWhen I checked out, I forgot a couple of shirts I left hanging in the closet. I was still in town, so I walked up to the Hampton Inn a few hours later and asked about the clothing. In about three minutes, my shirts appeared - neatly folded and placed into a plastic bag with my account number ready for me to claim.If you are traveling on vacation, or just have some free time on business, the beach is a short walk away - but it's far enough that you won't want to pop back to the room to use the restroom or grab a drink. The pool area seemed small and enclosed, but had a nice little bar that served food. Fine for business and probably acceptable for short periods on vacation, but this isn't a 5-star beach resort. FYI - if you have a rental car, parking is $5 per night, and you have to pay if you spend more than 20 minutes in the parking lot. If you're picking up a rental car for the day and need to stop by the hotel, make sure you get in and out fast. (NOTE - I rented a car from Charlie Car Rental a short walk down the street. They're open 24 hours, great service, clean cars, and you avoid the cab fare to the airport for a rental car if you aren't picking one up for the duration of your stay.)SUMMARY - I have absolutely no complaints. If I was on vacation, I might want a place on the beach instead of a 10-minute walk away, but the price is lower than an on-beach resort. For business travelers, this is a great location.

<Content>It's lovely if you stay indoors While planning our trip to Puerto Rico, I was shocked by how expensive most of the nice hotels were, even in low season (we went first week of April). This hotel lured me to book with it with its relatively lower price, nice photos, and good reviews. It turns out that the hotel IS pretty great. The front-desk staff was pleasant and helpful (we had to store our luggage with them for a day after checking out and there were no problems), the lobby was gorgeous, the breakfast was top notch (and free!), and our room was perfect, with silky smooth bedsheets, a clean bathroom, and ample space. The only problem is when you step outside to use the pool and hottub - the swim-up bar is cute and the hamburger fare offered there is good (albeit a bit too salty), but every ten minutes it sounded like an airplane was about to crash-land on your head. I could not believe how noisy it was, and I've lived near LGA airport all my life. It was literally like the planes were landing next door (and I guess they sort of were). Fortunately, the hotel itself is well insulated, so the noise doesn't affect you at all when you're inside. If it weren't for the noisy pool, the hotel would be an easy A+ (and probably cost a lot more). As it is, I give it an A-.

<Content>The Price is Right! We stayed at the Hampton Inn San Juan post cruise. We were looking for the best hotel for the money and I think we found it. Yes, the hotel is RIGHT by the airport - when you're at the pool you definitely hear the engines roar, but in the room I never heard the airport. The pool is nice - small, but clean with a swim up bar and grill. There were plenty of chairs by the pool and the towels were warm and cozy. The room itself was very well kept and clean and while the beds are on the smaller size, very comfortable. The location is very good - you're right across the street from the InterContinental and the Ritz Carlton in case you feel like you want to explore the resorts. We found the hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful. Cab rates to and from the hotel are fixed by the government, so you feel comfortable heading wherever you'd like. Our flight was too early in the morning to sample the breakfast, but I would definitely recommend the Hampton Inn for the money.

<Content>Airport hotel Yes the staff is friendly and helpful and if coming in late and leaving in the am i would recomend this hotel however it is literally on the runway where the planes take off. This is why everyone says no one is at the pool. It is so loud you cannot sit out there. I wish someone had made this clear before we stayed. The area itself is full of restaurants. The beach was close but further than a 2 block walk. I really feel there are better options that are the same or less money. Any questions, please feel free to e-mail me at luckyduck2001@aol.com.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location, Great Staff I travel to PR several times a year and always stay at the Hampton Inn in Isla Verde. I always have a wonderful experience - the staff are very friendly and helpful (will always point you to a great restaurant or book a local tour), the rooms are large and clean, and the location is excellent. You have a short walk to the beach, a ton of restaurants, and bars. There are several other large hotels nearby (on the beach) that are extremely overpriced and stuffy. I have stayed in a variety of these hotels as well and always have a poor experience. I highly recommend the Hampton Inn!

<Content>Not so Great Stayed here in March, 2006The Good: Overall it鈥檚 a nice hotel, although its far from a new property. The breakfast ins included and they do a nice job- choice of coffees and tea, fruit, a hot item, cereals, yogurt etc. The business center is a nice plus and offers free printing. The pool is on the small side- but never looked crowded. The people are friendlyThe not so good: The hotel has suites and standard rooms- I was in a standard room. The furniture is newer, but the rooms themselves are kind of beat up ( some mildew on the over calked bath tub, 鈥渂lack鈥?material coming from the piper in the tub, etc.). The hotel is very close to the airport and if you have the windows open you feel like you are sleeping on a run way. As with most Hamptons 鈥?this location offers no room service or restaurant- there is however a snack area at the pool- but it closes fairly early. Summary- stay there if the price is right but compare the Marriott Price and Availability first

<Content>Great Hotel! This is a great place to stay. Although there is airplane noise out at the pool, it was rarely heard inside. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The breakfast is great. The pool is wonderful and well kept. There are lots of good restaurants at the big hotels nearby but be prepared..they are pricey!all in all, we really enjoyed our stay here!!!

<Content>Way above our expectation We wanted to stay close to the airport and old San Juan on the first night of our trip to Puerto Rico. We booked the Hampton Inn as a place to sleep and didn't expect it to give us anything close to a vacation feel. To our superise, the hotel looked very nice and well renovated. The room has dark clean-line furnitures and a nice island pattern fabric deco. Looked clean and comfy. There are just so many things I liked about this hotel. Free wireless and cable internet in the room; A little nite-light in our bathroom which I thought was very thoughtful. The little store behind the front desk was great and helpful. The location of the hotel is convenient: 5-minuet drive from the airport, 3-minuet walk to the beach and there were some stores and restaurants nearby. The breakfast (hot) buffet was just a great way to start a day. The front-desk staff was very helpful and they have those nice direction cards to major attractions nearby.

<Content>Great place to stay! Clean rooms, wonderful front desk staff, great breakfast buffets.I had one small problem with my phone and one of the maintenance personnel overhead my comment. Next thing I know, he's upstairs fixing the phone! What service!Very personable staff - always friendly and polite. I can't say enough about them.The Tuesday night buffets are okay - get there early because the food does run out! The food by the pool area is good. As with everything in Puerto Rico, make sure you allow plenty of time - it's definitely NOT fast food!Close to the airport, but you can't hear the noise unless you're by the pool. You really can't go wrong here!

<Content>Hilton quality at Hampton Inn prices My wife and I stayed at this hotel for four nights over Christmas and found it to be excellent in many respects. Conveniently located near the airport, across the street from three major casinos, and with easy access to roads into and out of San Juan it deserves all the favorable reviews posted on this site. We had a suite which was rather spacious with a comfortable bed, refrigerator, microwave, room safe, coffee maker, and even the popcorn was provided. The breakfast bar offered an outstanding variety of food selections, far beyond what we expected. To top it off, on Tuesday evenings there is a manager's cocktail hour with free snack foods and drinks for guests in the lobby area. The Intercontinental hotel within the block has a nice beach/pool bar where one can enjoy a sundowner on the sand. The San Juan hotel and casino across the street is worth a visit,if only just to marvel at the lavish interior. The only negative was that on our last night maintenance work involving drilling and hammering was carried out within earshot of our room, keeping us from getting any sleep until we finally around midnight called the front desk asking that it be stopped.

<Content>Wonderful Find!! I have always stayed on the Condado when in San Juan; however, I had a last minute business trip and could not get into the Marriott.The Hampton Inn and Suites was wonderful from the time I stepped into the hotel. Front desk folks were very nice and very personable.The room was very nice and the bed was great.I will definately be back.

<Content>Outstanding service!!! We have just returned from a week at the Hampton. The hotel is magnificent and we experienced such incredible service. It was so great. We stayed in a suite. We were just expecting a few nibbles for breakfast but breakfast is a lovely continental spread with everything. The pool is lovely and the it has a pool bar and grill. Just walk up in the pool and have a good pi帽a colada and lunch. They offer pool towels which are large and think, not those cheap ones you would fine in other hotels. One thing i must say is that the beds at the Hampton are quite comfortable. Just like the Hilton's beds. The hotel is located in a central location so you can walk to a lot of places. Grocery store, restaurants, casinos, and the beach. The employees are wonderful. Especially Diana, she went out of our way to help us in directions, recommendations for dinner, and things to see. The price is great for the location and the service provided in this hotel. I would tell people to stay here.

<Content>Excellent hotel We stayed at the Hampton Inn and Suites for one night prior to catching a flight to Anguilla. The hotel is easily one of the best Hampton Inns at which we've stayed. Everyone is friendly and helpful and all facilities are very clean and well maintained. I really enjoyed the complimentary computer center located just off the lobby as well as the very attractive pool area. The hotel is very close to the El San Juan Hotel and the Four Seasons -- a 3 to 5 minute walk. Nice places to visit during your stay. There are numerous restaurants within walking distance. A cab ride to the airport takes 5 - 10 minutes and costs $12.

<Content>Nice, clean hotel This is a well-maintained, comfortable property in Isla Verde. It is a short cab ride from the airport and walking distance to the beach. It has a nice swimming pool. We stayed there for one night between flights and would do so again. If you want to vacation in Puerto Rico, this is not the place to stay because one can find equally comfortable hotels on the beach for comparable prices.

<Content>A Fine Choice We just returned from a stay at the Hampton Inn. The hotel is definitely not 5 stars or luxurious; a basic US style motor inn which excelled in one area: service with a smile. We are seasoned travelers and have rarely, if ever, encountered such a friendly staff, always willing to go the extra mile. We were frequently asking advice since the weather was dreary with constant rain. They never failed to be helpful and warm. Just great people! Also very nice was the free use of internet with a dedicated room just for a bank of computers so those of us who travel without laptops were able to stay conncected. There was absolutely never a wait and all of the computers were connected to printers which was very helpful for printing out boarding passes, directions etc. The free buffet breakfasts very very nice. Again, not luxurious spreads but all the basics in abundance, nicely presented and very very clean with all the spreads packaged. The breakfasts consisted of bagels, muffins, toast, yoghurt, fresh fruit, cereals, coffee and tea plus two hot dishes which changed daily which we, being kosher, did not eat, but seemed to be quite tasty. Everything else was kosher. The location of the hotel was quite convenient, close to the airport with no discernible noise, near some of the larger hotels (we always prefer smaller places) and with parking only $5./day and readily available.In short, if it's faux luxury you're seeking go elsewhere but if it's a basic , comfortable warm place dash over to the Hampton Inn.

<Content>Great Hotel!! We stayed at The Hampton Inn  Suites San Juan for 1 night pre-cruise. I got a great rate on the Hampton Inn Website of $149 for 3 adults for a king, pool view suite and included 2 free drinks! The room had a separate bedroom with a king-size bed, chest with 3 drawers and a 27 inch TV, 2 night tables and a closet. The other room had 1 huge chair, loveseat sized couch that pulled out into a full size bed, 29 inch TV, a table with 2 chairs, a coffee table, mini bar that had a small sink, small microwave, coffee maker and a mini-fridge. There was also a good size bathroom between the living room  bedroom. The room was nice and clean. The hotel had a huge sitting area in the lobby where they served a free continental breakfast in the morning and beverages all day along with a flat panel TV. There was also a nice sized pool with a swim-up bar and a hot tub. You also get free high speed internet access at the hotel as well! The hotel is walking distance from the beaches, Walgreen鈥檚, Pueblo鈥檚 supermarket, and many fast food restaurants. We ate lunch at the poolside grill and it was awesome!! We had hamburgers and my brother had a grilled chicken sandwich. They were all amazing!! They had great flavor and huge portions for only $22 with soda. We really recommend you try the poolside grill if you ever stay there! The only negative to the hotel is that it did have a slight smell of mildew and because it was Labor Day weekend, the hotel was sold out so it was a bit noisy!

<Content>Loved It!!!! The Hampton INN was a great choice, I planned a trip to San Juan a couple of months prior and since I was staying for a week I rented a house and ended up losing $1600 due to my military schedule and having to cancel the trip. This time I decided to get a hotel instead, the staff is great!! The rooms were nice and clean I stayed in a suit which was very roomy, enough for 3-4 ppl. But I think my favorite thing was the shower, whenever I go out of town I stay at the Westin because they have this thing called the heavenly shower and to my surprise The Hampton Inn has the same thing. There was one staff member name LUIZ and he was awesome and very helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone since it is in the middle of everything you won鈥檛 have to walk for to get places; also they always have taxis waiting outside for the guest. I don鈥檛 recommend driving around yourself unless you have been there before, the traffic is wild and they are not many traffic lights of stop signs plus they drink and drive openly. But once again this place it highly recommended.

<Content>Good choice We stayed at the Hampton Inn for one night pre-cuise. Although the hotel is quite close to the airport and the planes can be heard when outside, the room was quiet and clean. There is a nice little bar/grill by the pool, which had good food/drinks at reasonable prices. The breakfast buffet was good, with hot and cold food items. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Good value This hotel is located off the main strip in Isla Verde. It is next to the very pricey ESJ and Intercontinental, however costs half as much. The rooms were very clean, the staff friendly. The location is great, very close to the beach as well as restaurants and bars. The included breakfast saved money. The drawbacks were the following: The rooms were carpeted-since the climate is very humid, things took a very long time to dry. The airport is very close, so if the windows were open you would hear planes land and take off. Other than that I would definitely recommend this place. You would get all the benefits of the pricier places next door for half the cost.

<Content>Excellent choice Just returned from a pre-cruise stay here and it was perfect. Check-in was quick and easy and room on upper floor was clean -NO mold or odor. We enjoyed the breakfast and the beach, which was in walking distance. The hotel worked so well for us, we returned after the cruise for a day rate in order to have use of the shower and room and free Internet. I recommend this hotel for a pre, or post- cruise as well as for an affordable vacation stop. It is not a luxury hotel, but rather a predictable and reliable accommodation.

<Content>Pre-cruise Stay Stay here in February for one Saturday night prior to a cruise. Excellent room. Good pool area. Superb front desk staff. Great full breakfast and a really nice breakfast area. Easy to get to from the airport. I like Hamptons, but this was a cut above.

<Content>Only Place to Stay in San Juan, Puerto Rico Although close enough to the airport to hear the many flights, the HamptonInn  Suites was a comfortable oasis from home. Just a five minute taxi ride from the airport. I believe it was only rated 2 stars but it's a tipical4 star in USA. King size bed, extra pillows, extra toiletries in bathroom. Tubshower combination. Room service and deliveries accepted from in town places. Valet service if you need it. Breakfast at 6AM included in room charge. Hot and cold foods, fresh baked muffins. Fruits, juices and great coffee. Don't miss it. Gorgeous birds in residence in elaborate cages are fun to watch and one talks back. All the comforts of home away from home.Celebrated art work throughout the hotel. Small pool and separate hot tub.Poolside bar and grill. No bugs, mold, bad odors, peeling paint or wallpaper.Short walk to shopping and your tipical USA eateries-Burger King, KFC, etc.Try El Casita Restaurant-ten minute walk or less from Hotel. Local fare andgreat Italian food. Many locals eat there too. Short walk to sandy beach with lots of room to spread out and relax. Hotel gives AAA discounts so check before you go. A great place to stay-Hampton Inn and Suites.

<Content>Just say no! Stayed one night before sailing on a cruise. Chose this hotel because of the ratings and the price compared to other hotels in the area. Our room had a very musty smell. In the morning, there were small ant-like bugs all over the bathroom counter. Drinks at the Pool bar were way over-priced- paid $16 for two Bloody Mary's. Hotel lobby was nice and continental breakfast was decent. Out of all the hotels I saw in San Juan, Embassy Suites looked the nicest from the outside. Next year, I'll spend the extra $50 or $60 and stay at the Embassy.

<Content>Surprisingly nice Due to the snowstorm in NJ we could not depart on time to board the cruise ship in FL, so the airline flew us instead to the first stop on cruise itinerary - San Juan. Hampton Inn was the first hotel that had a room available when we arrived to PR around 1AM local time. We were very lucky to find out that it was a nice, clean place, located in a safe area. The breakfast was included and actually good enough even for our 4 year old - and she is very picky at that. There is a sizable pool on premises, and the beach is about 10 min walk away - that's with the 4 year old. They also have a gym - small but quite usable, and free use of computers with high speed internet - or use your own laptop with wireless access. Even though we lost 2 days of the cruise, I'd say that our stay at Hampton Inn still counts for vacation - and not a bad one.

<Content>Very nice! I stayed here with my new husband the last night before we were to head back to the states. It's a very good place--not what you'd think for an airport hotel. The parrots in the lobby are fun  friendly. The breakfast buffet was extensive and delicious. No beach, though--I'd recommend it as a great base while you're exploring the northeast of the island.

<Content>Great Bed's What a pleasant surprise! This was my first trip to San Juan so I read a lot of reviews. Trust me on this one, great deal for the money. I booked two king suites and they were clean, great beds, good service, good food at the bar and grill by the pool. You are a block and a half from the public beach that runs infront of the Intercontinental and Embasy Suites. Security is great on this beach, its clean and you have some access to the beach restaurants owned by the more expensive hotels. The pool and hot tub at the Hampton Inn was clean, with palm trees and bamboo surrounding the pool area. I will stay here again.

<Content>Great Value Stayed here for two nights and enjoyed the stay.The were a couple of things wrong with the room upon check-in, but the hotel very quickly corrected them, even though it was late at night.The location of the hotel is about 2 blocks from teh beach, and we wanlked the area from the hotel to the beach at night without trouble.The Hotel brakfeast is good, with hhot entrees, cereal, bagels, muffins, and a lot more.The only thing we disliked was that the jacuzzi/hottub by the outdoor pool did not seem to have a turn on switch anywhere and it was only warm, as opposed to hot.If going to Isa Verde again, I would stay here again. It's a great value when compared to the other lcoal hotels.

<Content>Reasonably Good Hotel I stayed at the Hampton Inn on a business trip June 21-25, 2004.The room rate was $150/night which I thought was a bit pricey, but par for the course in San Juan. Short, taxi ride from the airport cost $10. I arrived on Monday and didn't need a rental car until Wednesday, so I rented a car on Tuesday night = BIG mistake. By Tuesday, there were no rental cars in San Juan. I finally got one, but ended up paying a premium for the car. If you need a car, reserve in advance.My room was on the main floor with a view of the pool through a window. The room was very clean, the air conditioning worked well, and the furnishings were good. Found the room to be a bit musty. Safety deposit box in the closet (with key) and card swipe to get into the rooms. The pool and hot tub are in a courtyard - small but seemed nice. Maid service was every day and the bed sheets were turned down upon my arrival in the evenings. Washroom was clean with plenty of fresh towels.The Hotel was a 2 block walk from the beach with the Intercontinental ($$$) and Hotel El San Juan ($$$) right across the street. The beach there was nice, fairly empty, no waves, the water was warm with a bit of sea weed. I found numerous sand dollars in the water. There were a number of people kite sailing on the beach as it was quite breezy there.There is a shortage of parking in general in Isla Verde beach area. You have to pay to park at restaurants, etc. Parking at the hotel costs $5/day (you take a ticket when you enter, get the front desk to validate your ticket when leaving and feed your ticket into the machine on the way out).Front desk staff at the Hampton Inn were extremely courteous and friendly. One night, I drove into Old San Juan (25 minute drive with some heavy traffic in the Condodo area). The front desk staff recommded a number of nice restaurants and told me where to park + gave me a tourist road map and a little sheet with driving instructions. I ate at the Dragonfly restaurant - small, dark, romantic little restaurant in Old San Juan - had lamb chops and a rice dish that were to die for - expensive, but worth the trip. On my arrival back at the hotel, the front desk staff asked me where I ate and how I liked my meal. They even knew who my server was!The Hampton Inn has a free internet cafe with printers and a wireless WIFI internet system at the hotel. Internet access was free and you could access it from your room, the hotel lobby and even the pool bar! I borrowed a wireless card for my laptop ($100 refundable deposit) from the front desk. This enabled me to keep in touch with home and keep up with my email each evening. Local calls are free, but I was told it would cost about $5/minute to call Canada - expensive!It sounds like the jets from the airport fly right over the pool (very loud) but it didn't really bother me.There are several fast food restaurants (ie. Church's chicken, Ponderosa steak house, etc.) and well as reasonably priced restaurants (Mi Casita?) and expensive restaurants (ie. Ruth Chris steakhouse at the Intercontinental Hotel) within walking distance of the hotel. I walked to the restaurants at night - didn't feel uncomfortable walking at night. It seems that there is a police car patrolling the street every 2-3 minutes.The hotel offers a well stocked, free continental breakfast every morning (juice, milk, cereal, baked goods, yogurt, fresh fruit, toast and bagels, eggs and sausage).Expect traffic jams driving in San Juan in the mornings unless you get an early start (around 7:00am).Overall, a reasonable hotel with very nice front desk staff.

<Content>You can't do better than this! Just returned from a 7-day cruise out of San Juan. As I was traveling with a rather large group of family members (14) of varying ages, we made the decision to fly into San Juan one day early, and back home the day following our ship's return. SMART move on our part. Much less stressful, and our two nights at the Hampton simply added to the joy of our vacation!Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by the front desk staff and welcomed to a clean, cool, and attractive hotel. Our rooms were well appointed, comfortable and in excellent working condition. The pool was great - the swim up bar folks more than accommodating. Yes, you do hear an airplane take off now and then, but it seemed to us that the rooms themseleves were extremely soundproof - breakfast was fabulous too!When we returned a week later, the staff was waiting for us with the same smiles and friendly service they'd sent us off to the ship with. Imagine - they remembered us! We instantly felt at home, welcomed, and very happy to be there.I spend many a night in Hampton Inns around the country, but have to say that the San Juan Hampton deserves each and every accolade it has received. There's no reason to spend twice as much to stay across the street - or at any of the other pricey hotels - you can't go wrong here!
