<Content>All but avoid We thought we were getting a good deal based on rate ($170SG), location, breakfast included, etc. However, when we arrived, we found the following:- Rooms were old.- MRT is a 10-15 min. walk from hotel (need to walk through car port and then cross a couple streets).- No Wi-fi Internet access. Only Internet access is in the lobby at one of two terminals.We decided to look on hotels.com to make sure we're getting a good VALUE. We found that the global recession had forced many 4 and 5 star hotels to drop their rates. As a result, we checked out of the YWCA after the second day and moved to the Fairmont for the rest of our trip.Definitely look elsewhere before settling on this lodge.

<Content>Good value, could improve in some areas YWCA is centrally located, within walking distance of Orchard Street, as many reviews here already state. Checking in was quite quick, the only drawback was that reception asked for a refundable deposit in case we took anything from the room. This I thought was rather negative, as it clearly demonstrated lack of trust. The twin room we got on one of the higher floors was not bad, with views of buildings around. It was clean enough,though when showering I noticed that the shower tiles had mildew stains on them. Another negative point was that the kettle did not work. There was a TV and it worked alright though.The buffet breakfast was quite good though. (hang on to the coupon as they will ask you for it). There was a spread of boiled and fried eggs, tea and coffee, variety of juices, cereals, toast, ham, fried tomatoes, those fried potatoe things - can't complain it did fill you up. Other than breakfast, location and general cleanliness being ok, (some staff at reception were friendly, others were matter-of-fact) the hotel could improve by fine tuning the things that did not quite reach the mark.

<Content>YWCA Fort Cannning Lodge -- a great place to stay! I just returned from a 9-day stay at the YWCA Fort Canning Lodge, and I couldn't be happier. The room that I had was large, clean, and quiet. The front desk service was great. All the staff were very helpful and courteous. The breakfasts (included in the price of the room) were excellent. Best of all: the location. This place is a heartbeat away from Fort Canning Park (a must see) and from a major MRT station (Dhoby Ghaut). I'd definitely stay here again.

<Content>Never stayed there but it still cost us We booked the family room and I made sure they knew it was for a family with 2 teenagers , that is actually 4 adults. They confirmed the booking. We paid a non refundable deposit of SGD$297. About 2 months later they emailed us to say they had cancelled the booking because only 3 adults and a child under 12 can stay in the family room. We made a booking that day with another hotel and it was cheaper.. Fort Canning Lodge refused to refund our deposit despite the fact that they cancelled our booking after confirmation. After emails back and forth they offered us the family room for 4 adults back, but by that time it was too late. Why cancel it in the first place if they were willing to give it back to us. Still no refund and dont expect one but be very careful with this hotel. Also, even though its YWCA, its pretty expensive and you can get a better deal elsewhere in Singapore.

<Content>Y.W.C.A. (You Won't Come Again) That's what the taxi drivers said and he was right.My group got booked in all at different intervals. I had to wait 2 1/2 hrs to check in. we had all booked double roooms only to find all twin rooms, beds pushed together. Very musty smell in corridor.The fridge in the room shares the same plug as the TV ...then into the wall socket. Fridge didn't even work.Breakfast was well below par. Coffee was like sludge with grit, orange juice was just coloured water and waiters very gruff with guests. Ate out after that for all meals.Bathroom was horrible. The ceiling didn't even meet the wall, all pipes on display. The shower head was coming off. Water pressure in the sink was a dribble.We paid HK $1000 for a HK$200-300 room. Very overpriced for an old , badly needing renovation hotel.Choose wisely and go and stay in Chinatown, not to far away ; clean smells nice with all amenities surrounding everywhere.The team will not stay there again!

<Content>Great location but not for me I wanted to stay by orchard street but the most affordable one I found was YWCA. Location is great as it is so near the underground station Dhouby Gout and it's basically a 5 min walk to orchard road (where all the shopping is like oxford street in London). So cannot complain about the location but the hotel itself is not that great. I paid about 70 GBP per night. If I had dish out 20 GBP more I would have stayed at swiss hotel merchant court where we usually stay in singapore. That is a really really nice hotel but not near orchard street. The room at YWCA itself was ok, clean and acceptable. It even had a kettle and tea coffee to make in your own room. The wooden floor was very clean, that you can go barefeet. The pillow was too high but that could just be personal preference. The floor where I was on the 10th was a bit smelly and I was forewarned by the staff before I got there saying that due to renovations, there is a smell. The breakfast was ok, a bit plain with toast, rice, noodles, and a good effort in having an english breakfast (baked beans, mushrooms, eggs, and ham I think). I saw the pool which is a nice size, you can swim laps unlike the pool at swiss hotel merchant court which is more a paddling pool. The staff seemed friendly. With the price I paid, I expected swiss hotel service, ie someone to help with my luggages..etc... The type of people staying there are the lower class. not that is any problems with that but i got woken up both morning at 5-6am because they were checking out and talking in really loud voices waking up everybody on that floor. Maybe Singapore is getting more expensive and with the price I paid, it is the norm but if I had known, i would just have stayed at swiss hotel merchant court and caught a taxi to go down to orchard road. So don't think I'll stay here again as I 'd rather spend another 20quid more to get a nicer room with no smell and a good night sleep.

<Content>Spacious rooms, nice location, clean and airy We had previously checked into the 81 Bencoolen, for its convenience, pricing and location, but were uncomfortable. We trotted it up to YWCA Fort Canning Lodge to have better accomodation at a slight premium over the previous booking (S$235.00 for a standard twin-bedded double room). The staff at the reception were very accomodating and we stayed there with our two young boys for 5 days. The rooms were spacious and clean. The shower in the bathroom although could be replaced with something more modern or convenient; (you can't direct the flow of water; instead you stand in the way of the jet of water). The buffet breakfast and the self-service laundromat make life a lot more convenient especially when you are travelling with children for many days.All said and done, the Fort Canning Lodge was convenient, situated on the lovely and less visited Fort Canning Rise (where you can go for a lovely walk and visit the Battle Box). The staff were friendly, helpful and cheerful (probably it is a true Christian spirit!!!).

<Content>The location is OK... The location is OK...but a bit difficult to explain this hotel to the taxi driver. The standard room size is OK...but the room smells bad and the aircon is quite noisy...the toilet size is a bit small. But it is still acceptable for a hotel in Singapore, a beautiful and enjoyable country.

<Content>Safety in numbers I had a 5 night break whilst on business in the far east and decided to go and visit a couple of friends in Singapore, travelling alone for this part of the trip made me decide to opt for the security of the YWCA, cost was also a factor as I was having to pay for this myself.The location of Fort Canning Lodge is superb, only a few minutes walk to the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station and also within easy walking distance of Orchard road, famous for its shops and restaurants.The downside is perhaps, not unexpectedly, the lack of hotel style facilities, no real service at the front desk but their friendliness makes up for this.The restaurant is very basic and breakfast is hard to recomend, not a huge choice and poor quality food. I found the hotel corridors very noisy until almost midnight with young children racing around screaming, otherwise no real complaints.I might possibly stay here again but only for a short time, 5 nights was just too long.

<Content>good budget hotel For mid budge range of accommodation the YWCA is great. The food was nice as well as most of the staff. Rooms were a nice size, but the whole building is non smoking. The lodge is close to trains, which made accessing the city or Sentosa island easier. Nice place to stay. The pool is located on the 3 floor, but only has 3 lounges, which were often in use. I booked the delux twin room for my girlfriend and myself, and found only a double bed. Staff had to bring in a single bed, which wasn't all that comfortable. All in all this is a nice place to stay for the budget minded person.

<Content>Good location We spent 3 days at the fort canning lodge. The hotel is budget hotel and reasonable. The good thing about the hotel is location just at the end of Orchard road, trains 5 mins walk and central to little india, china town. Although found out a free shuttle bus service operates down the road. The breakfast was basic and dining room so outdated and needs refirbuishment so dissapointed on this note. lunch would not appeal since better palces outside the hotel down Orchard road and singapore shopping plaza only 5 mins walk, great places to eat around here and basment food courts may appeal to most people. No problems with hotel staff quite freindly shame the rooms and dning rooms need an upgrade. Rooms basic and no baths which my little daughter wanted, rooms reasonably clean.

<Content>Perfect for a short stop over Would definitely stay here again and recommend it. Its a very basic hotel. Our room was simply twin beds with a bathroom/shower ensuite. For the price we paid, it included a full buffet breakfast and it has also has a pool which is unusual for a hotel in this price range. One morning we had to catch an early flight and they arranged a simple packed breakfast for us which was appreciated (sandwich, apple and juice). Location is great, right near Orchard Rd and the MRT station. Very clean rooms and very quiet even though the hotel was at capacity. Front desk staff were efficient, a couple almost to the point of rudeness but that perhaps is a cultural difference rather than unfriendly? I would definitely stay here again. For a longer term somewhere nicer would be better but for a couple of nights stop over it was perfect.

<Content>Convenient location by MRT Had booked and had confirmed a twin bedded room but on arrival we were put in room with 1 double bed. Initial reluctance to provide alternative.However, young woman on desk more helpful and by the evening another bed had been put in our room.Clean,comfortable, basic accommodation.Very convenient for MRT and Orchard Rd. Across the road is Fort Canning Park;Battle Box worth a visit. Good pool at hotel; had this to myself for morning swim and a good place to chill after walking round Singapore. Recommend Komala Villas restaurant in Little India. Great food,very cheap,friendly staff.Tasty dosas. MRT is so cheap for travel and there is $1 back each time for return of card. Unbelievably cheap when compared to London. Easy to get from airport to hotel by MRT although try and avoid rush hour.I know you have to go there once, but Raffles really not worth it. Crowded, noisy, extra for tax and (poor) service.The rest of Singapore is much more fun.

<Content>Horrible manager and service. I was having an absolutely horrible experience. Our reservation could not be found. The staff and manager were not assisting us properly and were very rude. When their credit card reader could not process our credit card, we could not cancel and was forced to pay using cash. Otherwise they will still charge us 25% of the whole stay. Avoid staying in this hotel at all cost.

<Content>You get what you paid for! My husband and i have stayed at Fort Canning as part of our pre/post Star Cruises (w/c is awesome!) honeymoon. The frontdesk is accommodating, but you can see from their lobby that the hotel has been for ages. It obvious from the furnishings. But regardless of that, the hotel is tidy. Rooms are liitle bit spacious but nothing extraordinary. Its ok because we are not expecting anything fancy w/ this hotel. location is very good since its just a few minutes walking to the Orchard Rd. The breakfast buffet doesnt have a lot of choices and most of their tables are eight seaters. And to mention also, please avoid the period when flock of noisy students gather this place. They are all over the lobby, shouting, talking, running,etc.. You'll feel like your in a campus quadrangle. And it causes me a little headache. Above all, the hotel is just okey. If your not looking for anything fancy, this would be the right hotel since its a good value for money!

<Content>Okay place but got cheated on the bill. Location: was really good can easily catch a bus or MRT to Orchard Rd. Room: Was okay cant expect much out of it though. The A/C was not cooling fast enough. Food: Was bad, didnt have a choice at all, Eggs were served only boiled. Staff: Was not friendly at all, from the Reception to the restant Restaurant. Sin was having a kind of an expo Asiatec i think. and all the hotels were full therefore YWCA was charging a 10s$ upcharge on all rooms per night. What upset me was that they kept on charging 2 days after the event finished. Another couple who was checking out at the same time put a good fight but in vain. This was quite disappointing. Will stay here if i don't get anyother hotel in sin only.

<Content>Horrible experience How I wished I went to this website before I booked into the YWCA hotel.As a frequent traveller in Southeast Asia, I have had my share of bad experiences but for a 3-star hotel like this one, I couldn't believe what I saw.When we first checked in, the room given to us reeked of urine and the toilet seat was broken. Disgusted at what I saw, I requested a room switch which was initially denied by the receptionist. It wasn't until I requested to talk to the manager that I got my room changed.Second room had ants in the washroom floor. Ants. The A/C was ridiculously loud and when the hotel sent up a pest control person to deal with the ants, he ended up overspraying my entire washroom with pesticide. Needless to say, my room stank for the rest of the day.The TV cable was definitely sub-par. On their website, they advertise having nice cable TV, but in reality, there were only about 4 viewable channels with the rest being either fuzzy or difficult to see. 3 Star Hotel Huh? I've had much better TV service in Cambodia costing $10US a night.The service workers in the morning have no utter regard of customer service. I got a knock on my door at 9am from them requesting to inspect my 'minibar' in my room to see whether or not I ate or drank their goods. Without giving her permission, she literally walked into the room, invading our privacy.Frustrated, I demanded some compensation for my horrible experience. Luckily, one of the managers was very accomodating and was probably, the only one qualified in customer service. The best I got was a room upgrade to the 'family suite', not even a discount on the room rate.Sadly, the family suite upgrade also had ants on the table, the TV was fuzzy and even worse, the A/C system made even more noise than ever. At this moment, I was too stressed out and tired with the whole situation to bother making another complaint again. Upon checking out, the billing system wasn't clear at all and it appeared as if I was being double-taxed for the entire stay.I sent an email to the hotel about the situation afterwards and all I received was some non-chalant reply and a message not to submit an internet review of their hotel to 'tarnish their good reputation'. Some customer service I must say.Horrible experience, I really really wished I read this website beforehand and did my own research.

<Content>Value fof money Its a bit late to be writing this review but I still want to post it to help other travellers. We stayed at YWCA last june 2006 for 5 days. I'm with my husband and two kids then ages 10 and 4. Didn't have any bad experience with staff, they were all helpful. Our room is ok, not big but just the right size, its clean and you can expect a peaceful sleep. Bathroom is also ok, no bath tub but the shower is working perfectly. Buffet breakfast was not really a feast but there's enough food selection to satisfy your hunger. It is also very accessible. Short 5 mins. walk to get to MRT station. For the budget conscious family with kids, I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Tips for Singapore YWCA 12/30We try to go to Singapore/Malaysia evey year as it is very interesting experience. When we go to Singapore, we have a routinine. It involves,once we arrive, to check in at the YWCA(mem OK/price OK for Singapore). This we have done 6 times, with never a problem. The room is clean,and has a refrigerator/ air conditioning/TV/and a good bathroom with a shower. The two things I like best are:1.A nice,qood-sized pool outside. It's so good to enjoy the sun.The pool area is nice!!2. An all-you-can-eat breakfast(comes with the room) that includes a tray of cut papaya. It also means you're so full you can skip cost of lunch.Also it is located conviently near transportation. You don't have to tak an expensive cab.The route is the key(take these instructions with you)--Out the YWCA to the street,go left Get on the sidewalkto the left, Go to the end of the sidewalk and turn left up the down-ramp of the carpark. At the top, turn left. Go until on right are glass auto-open doore. Go thru to the elevator. Take to 1st floor. Out the door is three options:1. To the rightis a bus stop. Take a buss there to the Botanical Garden. The orchid garden is fantastic!!!2. Straight across the street, you take an escalator down to MRT underground train syste. It goes to bird park(bus required at the other end)/ downtown/ and orchard street.3. To the left of MRT station is a multi-story building. This is PLAZA SINGAPURA. A grocery store is to the back, maybe basement?, while there is a really good food court on a higher floos toward the back.Hope this is helpful. Have a good time!!!Don

<Content>clean and exceed expectations! With just 3 star hotel in mind, my hubby and I expected very little from what the hotel may offer, maybe some not so comfortable accommodation and facilities. But on the arrival to the hotel, we were greeted with a beautiful lobby and profesional front desk, and of course...with polite receptionists. The room was clean, spacious, with polished wood flooring. The bathroom has a modern setting with glass shower screen. Beside that, every morning breakfast at the cafeteria was basic but yet satisfying. We had a good time walking to the nearest Dhoby Ghaut MRT station everyday, and just a 15 minutes walk to the scenic Clarke Quay. Though this is our 1st time staying in this hotel, we will surely make our return to this same hotel again in the next holiday trip.

<Content>Stinky room  This place was sold to us by our home travel agent as acceptable but for the average tourist I think it's very sub standard.The place has an insect infestation they need to get sorted.The room we were first shown to had a very toiletsmell if you know what I mean.the room was poorly arranged- we had to re arrange the room just to put our 2 suitcases down. We had trouble with our lift card  got stuck in the lift for 5 mins.We asked for a room change  the reception staff weren't concerned at all.They moved us up a floor but the insect problem was worse.The bedding was stained  the cupboard had old food in it!The plumbing allowed us to smell someone else doing number 2's. The air conditining had black stuff belching from it onto the white towels.When we went for breakfast the next morning it was like being on one of my kids school camps. Picture dozens  dozens  DOZENS of the local kids with no manners  hungry in the breakfast room. also picture the basic budget breakfast they serve at school camps. Well, that sums up Fort Cannings Breakfast experience!!This place was 3rd class back packer. Shame they had the location cos they don't deserve it.We rang our Holiday Broker  they moved us.....

<Content>if you love ants The best attribute of this hotel is its location one minute away from Orchard road and MRT station. Tons of places to eat at all prices around. And this is a good news because the breakfast served is really not at standard, except if you like canteen food. The rooms are basic, and although you have a first sense of cleaningness, it is not at its best, or maybe I was not lucky. My room (standard) was full of ants, walking over my toothbrush, climbing the cattle or covering the study table. Very discusting. I have mentioned it three days in the row to the reception but I only got apolodises, no action. Don't expect great facility in your room with regard to internet. For the price, I will not return there and will rather go for a smaller and cheaper hotel in Chinatown, direct by MRT to Orchard.March 2006

<Content>Good hotel, value for money YWCA is not actually a hotel, as they call it a lodge or some might call is a hostel. But I couldn't see the difference, as it looks like a hotel to me.I stayed in this hotel with my wife and my junior in December 2005, a vacation. If you want to book this hotel, I would suggest book it via internet travel agent, as I only paid USD108 (approx SD180) for two nights stay (SD90 per night) including breakfast for two. If you walk in, the rate will be SD140 per night.My room was upgraded to deluxe room for free during my stay due to all standard rooms being occupied. The room is quite spacious. The floor is wood, no carpet. It's equipped with a queen size bed, standing shower (no bath tub), TV and mini fridge. The fridge has variety of sodas, bottles of cooled mineral water, and also two bowls of instant noodle. The price is approx double the market price, but I guess this is normal. Two packs of free instant coffee and tea each (3-in-1 type). No free drinking water though; you have to boil it yourself with a small kettle.There is a notice stating that all calls made from the room will be charged as same as calls made from public phone, it is by Singtel (one of the three telco). I don't know how true it is as I didn't make any call.At night, it could be a little noisy as what mentioned by other reviewer. The room is not sound proof, I could hear clearly other guest opening and closing their room doors, and also when they speak in the corridor. YWCA only has one restaurant, more like a coffee house actually. It serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, and it close at 9pm. You won't be able to get anything to eat after 10pm as the coffee house is closed, you would have to travel quite far to get a meal, especially after 10pm where shopping malls are closed too. This hostel also doesn't have room service. I guess this is the reason it's not called a hotel.The breakfast is only average. Not many choices, with a fried noodle, fried rice, sausage, toast, fried and boiled egg, salads and that's about it. Juice, tea and coffee are included, of course. During my stay, they have buffet dinner at SD8.80+, it's Chinese dishes, not much choice also, but value for money.Staying in YWCA is very convenient if you travel by MRT, as Dhoby Ghaut MRT station is just across the street. There're few ways to go to the MRT station, I would suggest entering the Park Mall car park, and take a lift to ground floor. Exit Park Mall through the lobby, cross the street and reach the MRT station. If you prefer taxi, it will be quite difficult to wait for a taxi at YWCA, as most taxis will be occupied, unless you pay extra SD2~SD4 to book for a taxi, or wait for someone to arrive at YWCA and take his/her taxi.Orchard Road is just 2 stations (MRT) from Dhoby Ghaut, so does Bugis Junction. Walking and taking MRT to most places of interest is no problem from YWCA. Except Singapore Zoo, which is located quite far from the nearest MRT station, I paid SD4 for a taxi from Zoo to Khatib MRT station.YWCA also has a swimming pool, quite big, not Olympic size though, this is a hostel, remember?Overall, this is a great hotel, or hostel for less than SD100 per night (via internet agent booking). If you are on a budget, just like me, look no further. If money is not an issue, go stay in Orchard road, so that the view could be better, and also a better breakfast.

<Content>Nice hotel, shame about the noisy groups staying Bright and airy reception area. Friendly staff. Coffee shop breakfast was adequate, though their toast machine doesn't work very well. Booked a standard twin room but was given a larger deluxe room with double bed. Bed very comfortable. Not able to get to sleep for first 3 nights of 5 night stay due to large and noisy asian school tour group filling the 9th floor. They yelled and screamed, ran along the halls kicking soft drink plastic bottles. Slamming their doors half the night. Received 3 phone calls during night from children (not sure if it was a prank, or they called wrong room). There was also a 5am fire alarm (that turned out to be a false alarm). Complained twice to reception staff about children, but not much was done. I guess the hotel makes its money from such groups, not single travellers like me. Easy walk through Park Mall, across Penang Road to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, or across Orchard Road to Plaza Singapura and all the shops. Good for the price, but very noisy when I stayed.

<Content>Basic Good Value We stayed 2 nights at this property on our first visit to Singapore. We found hotel staff very courteous and helpful. Rooms were very basic, but clean and comfortable. Be mindful that this property is owned and run by the YWCA - rooms are more hostel than hotel - but good value for money nonethless. We accepted a twin room as we were told that they do not have any rooms with double beds. Breakfast in the large dining room was an impressive and tasty array of both local and Western fare. Property is withing easy walking distance of Orchard Road shopping. Nice rooftop swimming pool onsite and management kindly let us use it to cool off before our evening flight, despite having checked out that morning.
