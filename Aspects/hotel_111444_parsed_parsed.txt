<Content>A wonderful place to have a holiday We returned after 3 years to spend a few days between Xmas and NY's. We used our platinum benefits and were given a BEAUTIFUL suite overlooking Copley Square.The staff are great,loved the Oak Room bar and dining room(for breakfast) but nothing is cheap especially when you are Canadian.The lobby is gorgeous especially with festive decorations, speedy elevators, a very effective front desk staff...all made for a wonderful stay.We returned for 1 night Jan 1st, all was good except our deluxe room had NO view, could be depressing

<Content>loved the fairmont - especially catie the canine concierge This is a great fairmont -- loved the historic hotel, beautiful lobby, nice restaurant and bar, clean nice room, but above all loved being able to sign out Catie the Canine Concierge (big lovable black lab) for a walk. Great hotel, great service too.

<Content>Excellent Stay We were there on business but the hotel made us feel on vacation. We were on the gold level and it's true it's a hotel within the hotel. Being on only one floor it's great! Both the room and the lounge are very well furnished and made to look more like an old mansion than a hotel, charming and cozy!All the staff were very kind and helpful: the concierge on the gold floor who made our check in and out really fast and gave us great suggestions for dinner, the waiters who always cheered us in the morning and went out of their way to pamper us, and the cleaning ladies who did a fantastic job in keeping our beautiful room spic and span. The quality and quantity of food, both for breakfast and for the evening aperitif was excellent as it was the honor bar.Extra bonus goes to the free wireless connection!All in all a great experience in an excellently run and beautiful hotel in a superb location! When I go back to Boston I'll surely go back to the Fairmont!

<Content>Perect weekend getaway! Loved the Fairmont! The room at the Fairmont was clean and beautiful.....it felt as though we were staying in an old mansion. Book the Gold Room level if you can. The service was amazing and it was so convenient to have breakfast, snacks, and drinks right at hand. My husband requested a different pillow.....housekeeping brought 5 different kinds for him to choose. I would absolutely stay there again and would recommend it to everyone.

<Content>Loved the Copley!! We recently stayed at the Copley for a wedding. The event itself was beyond belief; everything was perfect and the staff could not have been more attentive. The room was small but spotless with a beautiful bathroom and a delightfully comfy bed. Great location; right around the corner from Newburry Street shopping.Just loved it there!!!

<Content>Fairly Good Experience at the Fairmont This is a mixed review. I would recommend the hotel for its location, generally attentive staff, its ambiance, and a few other things. We traveled as a family while my husband attended a conference and I came with the baby. We arrived after a red eye, having paid for the day before ($300 night) to ensure the room was ready, which it was, including the crib. Nice. I had inquired if there was a refrigerator -- needed to just store a small bottle - and they put in a small refrigerator in the room (nice intentions) but there was already a mini bar fridge in the room, thus making it unnecessary, especially since it broke the second day. We were not able to get the Club level, which probably would have been great given the other reviews, and we had a fairly small room, especially since there were two refrigerators (again, thanks, but just the mini bar would have worked). The bed was comfortable and there was an iPod stereo which was nice. Okay, the negatives...room service. Because of the 14 month old, I had to order room service a few times and we had problems with both the quality of food and missing items (which were rectified). So, if you can avoid it, don't order room service. Also, it is an older facility and so the heating conditions vary. I had to open the window (and it was really cold) so the the room could become more climate, but this wasn't an ideal solution. The only other negative is that there wasn't always a doorman, which was difficult when I was returning alone to the hotel with a stroller, but there was always a lot of foot traffic so someone generally opened the doors for us. What I really liked about the hotel was the concierge, Jim, and his black lab, Catie, who is at the hotel during the day. They are fantastic (and you can buy a book which goes to charity). The staff always gave me good tips on shopping, as well as restaurants, which is so important. Also, the Oak Room is an old style bar which is nice to enjoy a drink (sans enfants). The other positive is that the hotel is close to a Hertz and it is near the highway ramp going to New York, where we went after being in Boston. The only other tip is that if you join their club you can avoid the daily $15 internet access charges. All in all, the Fairmont is a good hotel, and probably great if your room is large and well situated and you don't have to order room service.

<Content>Perfect location and excellent experience. My husband and I took our daughter to look at Boston area colleges and wanted something nice and right in the middle of everything. The hotel was perfect!! Fabulous location. Great room. All these interesting hotel history documents lining the walls in the hallway to our room, which was gigantic with a huge bathroom and a great view from both rooms facing the Public Library building. It took me 10 minutes to get to our room because I was so fascinated by all the old menus and event programs they had framed and displayed. The bellman could not have been more helpful in dealing with our rental car, which is not always fun in the middle of a city. And we LOVED the lobby dog!

<Content>Gold Floor Best Ever We stayed on the Gold Floor (club floor) at the Fairmont Copley Plaza in Boston when we went back for Parents' Weekend at my daughter's college. It was fantastic! As an owner of On The Map Travel, I stay at plenty of great hotels. This Gold Floor experience was one of the best because the club rooms were elegant, cozy and felt like home (if you lived in a mansion!). The service was excellent; the food they put out for breakfast, lunch snack, cocktail time and light dinner was good and varied every day. It's not that much more per day to upgrade to this level - but worth every penny.

<Content>Excellent Hotel - only two minor quibbles! Staying at the Fairmont Copley Plaza was a fabulous change from the usual business hotel. The renovated rooms are lovely - mine was very big on the corner, with a nice desk area, large flat screen TV and a fireplace with mantle. The bathroom was also nice and new, with a deep bathtub - a real plus!The people who work at this hotel were also exceptionally nice and helpful and everyone at my company loved Catie the Canine Ambassador - who has her own business cards.Two slight quibbles with the hotel - the first was the dinner we had in the Oak Room when we first arrived. Looking for a light supper, we ended up paying extortionate amounts of money for substandard fare - particularly the sandwiches. Secondly, when renovating the hotel they should have made a bigger fitness center rather than pushing you to the health clubs nearby with their hefty fees. There were three running machines and two ellipticals, in decent condition, but v. busy at peak times.Apart from those minor things - the location, staff and rooms were all excellent.

<Content>Excellent Central Location in Boston I stayed here for 6 nights while attending a conference in Boston. This is an excellent hotel. It is a very typical Fairmont experience with excellent service, great food and confortable rooms. The rooms are well equipped including high speed internet and hdtv. It is very clean. There is a lot of history throughout the hotel, which was very interesting.The location of the hotel is the biggest highlight for me. It is very well situated, just two blocks away from Newbury Street, where there is some of the best shopping in North America. It is walking distance to a lot of great bars, pubs and restaurnats. Above all, it is right next to two different T subway stops, so it's just a hop and a skip to get anywhere in the Boston area, including Cambridge, Freedom Trail, etc etc. The only drawback is that the hotel is perhaps slightly overpriced. However, if you find a great deal, this is a fantastic place and it does earn a highly recommended from me.

<Content>Traditional, old-Boston experience -- excellent place If you are looking for a traditional, old Boston experience, Fairmont Copley is the place.The lobby and public rooms are in the grand-style with marble columns and panelled walls. The rooms for meetings and events are truly beautifull.The sleeping room was more than satisfactory: very good furnishings and window treatments, comfortable bed, and the newly remodeled bathroom was luxurious, with separate bath and shower areas, bidet, and excellent soaps/amenities.Food was good -- and the atmosphere of the Oak Room is quiet and comfortable.Service deserves special mention: the staff show attentioin to the comfort of guests -- and express a genuine hospitality. Much appreciated.The Fairmont Copley Plaza is not inexpensive -- but it offers tradition, comfort, and hospitality throughout that go well beyond that of most hotels (including those in Boston!).

<Content>You know exactly what you are going to get As with most English tourists we started our New England trip in Boston. As most of our accommodation was in small inns we decided on a large hotel to start.We've stayed in numerous Fairmonts in the US  Canada and they have always been consistently good. There is no wow factor but equally everything is either just good or above average. The Oak room restaurant was a bit pricey but very good, the room spacious enough and clean, the concierge good at recommending restaurants and giving directions (although didn't know where the Dollar car rental office was). All in all the Fairmont is very well positioned if you want to walk round Boston, which we did.

<Content>Fab! A beautiful hotel in a beautiful city! We were lucky enough to be upgraded to 'Gold', which they call a 'hotel within a hotel'. It was this which made our stay extra special, we got a free breakfast every morning of our stay, and all snacks in the kitchen free and cheaper drinks than in the bars. The staff were very friendly and courteous. The location is perfect for exploring the city, we walked EVERYWHERE! make sure you have comfy walking shoes! Felt very safe. Would definately go back to this hotel again as it was in such a perfect spot! Catie Copley the hotel dog can be taken out for a walk if you're missing your pooch!!!!

<Content>Will return! I stayed at the Gold Level, so can only comment on my particular stay....When I arrived there was a problem with there not being a doorman to take my bags, so I was rather upset...The management practically tripped over themselves to make up for it....A beautiful pecan crusted brie, crackers, fruit, and bottled water brought to my room etc..Call from the manager as well as a note...After that initial problem, absolutely nothing was a problem after that...The personal attention paid to you is just wonderful. All of the concierge were first class all the way. The kitchen with anything that you would want all day was divine. The room was cleaned very well everyday. The hotel itself is gorgeous, and the lounges and rooms on the gold floor, with breakfast every morning, and trays of hor d'oerurves in the evening, along with a bar, is well worth the extra money that the Gold dictates....My room overlooked the Trinity Church and the Square...and the room itself was beautiful...Only one thing needed improvement and that was the cable reception, and the fact that 2 of the remotes would not work most of the time...I, personally, did not care about the television, but if my son had been with me, he absolutely would have...Overall, it was a splendid experience, and I will definitely return...Thanks Fairmont Gold Staff for making my trip to Boston, just that much more special!

<Content>Lavish, comfy, friendly This old hotel has been refurbished to be super-comfortable, with only minor lapses (so-so water pressure in shower, slightly disorganized restaurant). The staff, however, were uniformly helpful and friendly. Fodor's describes the decor as over the top, and we would agree (both deer heads and cherubs in the Oak Room dining room, marble and mirrors and gilt and floral carpet everywhere!). But the exuberance of the decor doesn't dim the fun, if you're in the spirit of the place. The location was perfect for a Boston weekend, and we enjoyed our stay immensely.

<Content>Can't complain, overall positive experience1 I found a great deal on travelzoo.com and booked it through the hotel's actual website. Upon arrival, they accidentally gave us a room key to an occupied room. We went back to the front desk and they immediately upgraded us to the Gold level which is the club level floor. It included a really nice (and free) breakfast. The room was clean and quiet. It was spacious though could certainly use some updating. Overall - bed and room was comfortable. The bathroom was nice and included an oversized tub which we enjoyed. Great location too! We recommend renting bikes and riding over the bridge to Harvard. It's a beautiful ride and definitely a good work out too.

<Content>Lovely hotel The exterior of the Fairmont Copley has always struck me as grandiose and charming, so of course I was thrilled to have the opportunity to stay there. The lobby is absolutely exquisite, and the staff were warm and welcoming. The rooms didn't quite measure up to my expectations based on the exterior and lobby as the one I stayed in was on the smaller side. However, the bathrooms were larger than most I've seen and the overall decor was stylish and clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel to those looking for a pricier hotel for a weekend stay in Boston, close to many opportunities for great shopping,entertainment, and activities.

<Content>Loved it!! After doing some research online and checking out other hotels my husband and I decided this hotel looked the best. We specifically wanted to be within walking distance of Newbury St. and they are within 2 blocks. This hotel was the 2nd most expensive of the ones we compared, but it looked so beautiful we decided it was worth it. It was! The hotel lobby is gorgeous and the whole hotel makes you feel like you've gone back in time. Our room was small (perfect for two people without a ton of luggage), but we knew that going in and it we didn't intend to spend a lot of time in it so it didn't matter. My first impression of the room was that it was very clean, which is something most hotel rooms do not do to me. Even the bathroom was sparkling and I'm usually most wary of those. Also the bed had to be most comfortable bed we ever slept in. We were totally in love with it after the first night. We had forgotten to ask for a late check out so we called down to the front desk and we told it wasn't a problem. Overall the staff was exceptionaly friendly and accommodating. When we realized my husband forgot his razor, it was immediately sent up with some shaving cream. We were only booked for one night but the second day we were having so much fun we decided to extend our stay. Even though we had checked out, when we called to book again we were treated as though we had never left. We even got the same room again.Only a few minor things worth being aware of. Our room was near the elevator and it seemed that hallway noise came straight in through our door so that woke us up a bit in the morning. Second, the tub in the bathroom connected to the sink with a small counter, no glass. The shower curtain didn't close the whole gap (it ran along one side and the end) so you had to choose which end to let the water escape from. And lastly, the parking seemed expensive ($42/day) but I suppose thats fairly standard for city rates. Overall we loved staying here and are already trying to work out if we can stay again when we have to be in Boston again in October. For its central location to Newbury and Boylston streets with the shops and restaurants it just can't be beat. Also the Oak Bar is absolutely stunning and worth a drink or two in there.

<Content>Fantastic Location, nice hotel but overpriced. We stayed here form 5 nights from the 18th to the 23rd of August, and I have to say, the location can鈥檛 be beaten:- Right on Copley Square with Newbury Street a block away, next to the Green Line 鈥淭鈥? and downtown a few blocks away to the east. The Prudential Mall is 5 minutes away, and the Common the same in the opposite direction. Also on the positives, the room was pleasant, clean and relatively spacious, and it was a very comfortable stay (the bed was fantastic). The staff are pleasant, and the air-con was more than adequate. The room (ours was on the 6th Floor) had a large closet space, which meant your room didn鈥檛 need to be cluttered with cases, and contained a safe box and iron/ironing-board.Right, the bad news: The room has an extensive supply of outrageously overpriced minibar items, but no coffee or tea facilities, which is a bit of a pain. A bottle of water in the room was $8鈥?brings new meaning to the term 鈥減recious water鈥? The cost of internet access is $14 a day, which is exuberant given internet access in a lot of hotels is free. If you are staying on the Gold Level (4th Floor) there is free WiFi, which we could access in our room and can be picked up in other areas of the hotel. Room service was a joke. We had to ring three times to get an order put through, and while the cost on the menu wasn鈥檛 too different that other hotels in this range, the extra costs added on were ridiculous鈥? on top of the menu prices there is a 18% gratuity (which when forced on you isn鈥檛 really a gratuity at all, now is it?), $5 delivery charge (so what鈥檚 the 18% for?) and tax. This meant we ended up paying nearly 35% more for the room service than the menu prices indicate. Fair enough, they tell you this on the menu, but it doesn鈥檛 make the excess any more palatable. Naturally, we decided against room service other nights, and instead settled for stocking up on snacks from the 7-Eleven and CVS across the square.The hotel itself is quite impressive, the lobby and reception areas are more like a grand imperial hotel in Europe, and for location alone, I would probably stay here again, but my expectations would be a lot less, and room service would be off the list.

<Content>A Grand Old Hotel My wife and I just returned from a 3 1/2 stay at the Fairmont. It is a beautiful old hotel and located in a very desireable part of Boston. We walked to Fenway Park and many local restaurants. The only complaint I have was the food we received via room service was not very good especially for a 4 to 5 star resort like the Fairmont. The quality of the food overall was only average to just above average. I do recommend staying at the Fairmont because it is well maintained and well located. The Fairmont also has the best concierge, (Jim, who has been there 30 plus years) He obtained great seats for us at Fenway and a Rod Stewart concert. If you want to get into special events in the Boston area, Jim is The Man!

<Content>nice city shame about the hotel we stayed for 1 week in August 4-11th,2008, found hotel to be showing its age ,Doormen and staff very polite and courteous. But as a show Hotel for Boston ,I think it could do with some updating.As some people have said it is surrounded by some good buildings ,such as Trinity church and the Library,but is overshadowed by the monster skyscraper of the Hancock tower. I will not recommend this hotel to my friends or family as I believe more modern hotels exist in the city. What I can say is we experienced some history that the hotel showed in its makeup.

<Content>Very disappointing - Stay Away!!! A very disappointing hotel. The rooms are plain and unimaginitive and are totally blocked from natural light by the highest building in Boston which is positioned next to it. The age of the hotel is noticable. Acomplete lack of public rooms. Only one bar which is dark and miserable, nowhere else at all for guests to relax. Noise from weddings on the 3 nights we were there was unbelievable. A companion found a FLEA in her bed. Staff smiled politely but were toally ineffectual. They just didn't want to know, were smug, huffy, snappy and useless in dealing with the public, from the bellman to the manager. Take my advise and avoid this place like the plague. I don't give bad reviews, read my others, but don't stay here.

<Content>Elegant and Exquisite Wonderful experience at the Fairmont Copley Plaza. We had two unique and beautiful rooms overlooking Copley Square - window seats and a fireplace. Cocktails in the bar were expensive ($17 martinis) as was breakfast but the service and atmosphere were extraordinary. Concierge and all staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful even providing complimentary champagne for our anniversary, and the location is stupendous. My teenage kids would like to live at the Fairmont Copley Plaza permanently.

<Content>Great location. Great service. Great location. 2 blocks to Newbury St. A block to Copley (green line) T stop. Superb service. Staff was friendly and welcoming. Got a deluxe room which is much bigger than the standard room. Still bathroom was small -- couldn't fit more than one person at a time.Valet parking is pricey $42 but you get in/out priv so it's pretty easy (need to notify about 20 mins before you want the car ready).

<Content>Disappointing The hotel location is excellent and the entrance, lobby etc are really nice. However the standard room we had was small, plain and very disappointing and did not live upto the impression created by the rest of the hotel. Hardly any space and no seats and no in room tea and coffee. We travelled for 3 weeks across North America and this was the most disappointing hotel. Our first night, after a long day travelling, was a nightmare. Between the band in the ball room which went onto 12.30, then the sound of the noisy airconditioning in the room. When we complaint, we got short shift and it was suggested outright that we were looking for an upgrade! After making it clear that we were after a good night sleep not an upgrade we eventually got moved. At least the air conditioning was silent in the new room.

<Content>Phenomenal Phenomenal staff - they even have a resident dog in the lobby! The hotel itself was extremely impressive. The lobby was a complete WOW. The rooms are tastefully decorated. And the location is absolutely perfect. Next to the best shopping in Boston and about a 20 minute walk to the waterfront attractions. A 5 in every way!

<Content>Great Location My family and I arrived early in the morning at about 10am. Most hotels these days won't let you check in early, the Fairmont was the exception. Lisa the front desk trainee noticed we had children in tow, she asked for my number and told us she would call as soon as a room was available. We went across the street and had breakfast and when we were finishing the phone rang. Our room couldn't accommodate both a crib and a roll away so Lisa had our room upgraded. When we went to our room the crib and rollaway were already set up. Don't miss the Oak bar in the Lobby. My waiters name was Kirk and he served me the best beer in my life and kept my needy family happy. The beer comes with a hot soft pretzel hanging off the front on the glass. I will be going back to Boston in September and will be staying at the Fairmont.

<Content>Nice Experience Overall My husband and I stayed for 3 nights -- our room although it had an ugly view of a courtyard was nice, clean and stylish. We really enjoy the location of this hotel given that it is easy to get pretty much anywhere from Copley Square. The lobby was a great meeting place for us and some of our friends who we met up with through out our stay. We had drinks at the Oak Bar which was a good experience even though the waitress wasn't really on the ball. Overall it was a classy hotel, with clean/stylish rooms and was a good experience for us. The staff were also very accomodating. One day I accidentally left the Privacy tag on the door while we were out all day -- when I went back to the room to get a couple things mid day (4PM) the room attendant heard me she came down the hall to see if I wanted the room made up. I told her I would be out for an hour and when I came back the room was all set. Normally this late in the day you are just out of luck getting your room done. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Under Whelming and Mediocre I travel to Boston fairly often for business and love the city. Normally I stay in the Financial District as it鈥檚 close to my office and the airport. For this trip, I decided to stay in the Back Bay for a change in venue and The Copley Plaza offered a decent rate ($325 for a 鈥淔airmont鈥?room) through our corporate travel department and had rave reviews on tripadvisor.Here鈥檚 what I took away from my stay:Positive points:- Good location near shops and restaurants- Bonus FF miles w/stay- Free internet (if you鈥檙e a Presidents Club card holder) - although the connection was painfully slowLess-than-positive points:- Tiny room with virtually no soundproofing - could hear people in next room/hallway and doors slamming at all hours- No view, fresh air or natural light! Window faced other rooms across a dingy 鈥渃ourtyard鈥? Window opened but the restaurant exhaust fans were loud and spewed foul odors from below.- Sticky mouse trap under the nightstand - need I say more??Granted 鈥渉istoric鈥?hotels have their idiosyncrasies but this hotel has more than its fair share. Would I stay at this hotel again? Probably not. The generic Westin across the street would be a better choice or in the Financial District the Boston Harbor or Langam are nice too. All in all left under whelmed by the lackluster Copley.

<Content>Weather took my breath away Boston has to be the coldest place I have ever been and the wind literally took my breath away! Hotel is in the perfect location to deal with the weather though. Just across the road you can go into another hotel (sorry forgotten the name) and from there you can work your way through hotels and shops all the way to the Prudential Centre without going outside. Also lots of restaurants through here so great in the evening. Back to the hotel. We had a room which was separated into a bed area and then a small lounge area with the bathroom in the middle. This made it even more relaxing for us as we could come back to the hotel in the afternoon to relax and put our feet up after all the walking especially around the Freedom Trail which is a must do. We were there for Valentines and wanted to eat in the Oak Room but obviously fully booked so we had room service which comes from there anyway! Service and food excellent. And Catie is so laid back and looks like she enjoys her life. I enjoy staying at Fairmont Hotels as they are usually in older buildings and have so much more character then new buildings. They may be a bit tired around the edges (draft round the windows) but the luxury is still there.

<Content>Classic Boston Our stay was excellent here, we enjoyed the historic nature of the hotel. The bar was pricey, but it was quite a classic experience.The room was great, clean and spacious. We chose to dine nearby on Newbury street and did some shopping as well.The Charles river was only a few blocks away, which was a prime location for a run. The room rate was very good, which we got using the AAA rate. Some minor concerns, front desk did not always answer the phone, the parking fee was $40/nite, breakfast was pricey. I would suggest using the Starbucks or Au Bon Pan across the street.Staff was wonderful and very helpful.

<Content>Beautiful Fairmont Hotel Boston My family enjoyed 4 lovely nights at the Fairmont on the Gold level. The room was nice and large and had great period details that really made the hotel and the room feel special. I would highly recommend the Gold level if possible. This added so much to our stay. We really felt that we could leave the room and have a little space to read the paper, enjoy a cold drink and have some extra quite time. The breakfast was good - and being able to have a access to waters, sodas etc all day was great. Especially since we were there during a terrible heat wave. The staff in the Gold level was great about maps and directions - and Nick especially got us some terrific dinner reservations.

<Content>LOVED THE GOLD FLOOR!!! The hotel was fantastic! We had a private check in on the 4th floor, everybody was really friendly. The room was amazing! I felt like royalty! They had complimentary breakfast in the morning, and they said it was continental breakfast so we thought it was going to be a basket of muffins, but there was a huge spread, they had eggs and meats and cheeses, breads and cereal, pretty much everything you could want. We really felt like we were valued, the concierge took extra time with us to show us around and make sure we'd have everything we needed. It was amazing.

<Content>WOW, wish we had stayed longer. Loved this hotel. It is as good as the Ritz in London. Only stayed two nights but will stay here again when we are in Boston. Beautiful hotel with nice rooms. We had a Fairmont Gold room, well worth the extra money. The food in the lounge was fantastic. They even allowed us to entertain our Boston family members who visited us at the hotel. Very nice to have a place to sit and visit with family that offered great nibbles and drinks. Do stay here when in Boston.

<Content>Take the Gold Level Have stayed here a few times and always book the Gold Level. Upgraded rooms, excellent breakfast included. Beyond the normal offerings. Wonderful honor bar system with top wines and Champagnes. The beds on this level are top notch...I didn't want to get up in the morning!Rooms are average, bathrooms on the small side. Great location near Copley. The Westin is across the street and is a perfect choice for the business traveler. But if you want old school charm and a step back in time, the Fairmont is a wonderful choice for a weekend get-away or a romantic break from reality. Again, pay the extra and upgrade to Gold service.Also parking here is very, very expensive. Try for an alternate nearby garage to avoid the $40 per night fee.

<Content>Good for the money, but needs updating..... We booked this room on priceline for $129. The listed price on Fairmont.com was $260+ a night. $129 was not bad for a great location as it is across the street from to Copley Place and the Prudential Center. Parking in the area is an experience. We arrived late on a Saturday, so I was able to park on the street at a meter, and they don't require to be fed on Sunday. If you can't find a metered spot park in a garage youself and walk a block, there are several in the area that cost around $20 for a night. Otherwise, the hotel charges around $30-$40 plus tip, and they'll take it to the same garage! I found our room to be old and somewhat outdated. There was a mousetrap behind the entertainment center (never good to know one is needed). The bathrooms were newer but the paint and tile job were not crisp as you might expect in a top tier hotel. This is probably not the right place to stay if you are travelling on business as there is a lack of electrical outlets. The bed was adequate, but not up to the Westin/Starwood heavenly bed levels that should be standard for a room in the $300 range. Overall, the room was o.k. for the price, and the location is hard to beat. I just would not have wanted to pay the $250 + tax and parking rate.

<Content>Best location I went to Boston on a college tour and the location was excellent. It is convenient to the metro, two blocks from the train station, and within walking distance from Quincy Market. Couldn't be better. Hotel is traditional. Service is very good. Only downside is fitness room. They should upgrade their equipment.

<Content>Fantastic My husband and I stayed at the Fairmont Copley Plaza for the final part of our honeymoon. When we arrived we were blown away with the amazingly beautiful lobby - if you choose not to stay here, it's worth a trip inside just to see it!! Catie, the hotels own black lab is a lovely addition to the hotel and has the run of the lobby.Check in was swift and friendly and we were delighted to have been upgraded to a superior room. Our room was lovely - an extremely comfortable bed, and although small, a beautiful bathroom. On our first night a member of staff arrived at our door with Champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and a congratulatory note from the hotel manager to celebrate our marriage! A fantatic touch.The breakfast in the hotel was wonderful and not too expensive (though this was helped by the favourable 拢/$ exchange rate!) We ate dinner in the Oak Room once - it was a fantastic experience. The meal, wine and service were wonderful.The location is perfect with a subway stop across the square and very close to to the fantastic shopping/dining on Newbery Street and the Prudential Center - we recommend taking the trip to the viewing platform in the Prudential Tower.I would recommend the Fairmont Copley Plaza to anyone visiting Boston who would like just that little bit more that simply somewhere to sleep.We will stay here again should we be lucky enough to visit the fabulous city of Boston again.

<Content>Unfortunate experience Lovely hotel, but unfortunately our stay was marred by a theft. Our daughters purse was taken from the Oak Room even though we were the last customers to leave that night, so another patron didn't take it. The purse was gone in the morning. There are security cameras all around; but they don't bother to use them for security reasons such as this. I'm not sure what they are for; but whoever stole the purse must have known they aren't on, or aren't reviewed. The staff, except the Oak Room evening manager, didn't seem to care much about the problem.

<Content>Beautiful, historic hotel - Great Back Bay location We are always skeptical using priceline, especially in expensive Boston, but we were pleasantly surprised with the Fairmont Copley Plaza. The Fairmont is everything you want Boston to be, steeped in tradition, yet totally comfortable and inviting. The location is perfect, right next to Newbury Street, a multitude of shopping at Copley Plaza, and a short stroll to a toasty Starbucks. One warning, when walking by the John Hancock Tower (the tall glass buliding) beware of the extreme winds. Back to the hotel...very nice room details, comfy bed, great bathroom. I have two issues that must be discussed:1.) The heating system...we could not turn it off. We were in a room with a fantastic view, but the windows would not open. The front desk quickly mitigating this with a fan. Annoyance gone! 2.) I hate when expensive hotels nickel and dime you....a bottle of water for $5?? Give me a break. Run next door to CVS and pick up some Poland Springs for $.99.

<Content>Great location for a tourist. V.comfy bed. Try the "Fairmont Gold" After browsing the reviews here, we decided to book a Gold Signature room at the Fairmont Copley Plaza for our 5 night stay in Boston in mid December and we were certainly not disappointed. As we had a long flight from Australia to Boston, we decided to arrange for a car to meet us at the airport. I called the hotel concierge a week before to arrange this and the driver was there to meet our late night flight which was most welcome after our very long day of travelling.The hotel was really well located for a tourist in Boston. Many attractions are within walking distance, a subway station is across the street and the Amtrak rail station is a couple of blocks away. We hired a car from Avis when we left Boston and it was also walking distance near the Amtrak station.The hotel is a beautiful historic building - only 6 0r 7 storeys high - with lots of ambiance. It reminded us of the Willard Hotel in Washington DC, where we have stayed previously. The rooms have all been renovated but still have that classic style rather than a modern look. Our room was a good size and the King bed was extremely comfortable. We slept very soundly during our stay. The Fairmont Gold concept is excellent. The whole of the 4th Floor is devoted to Fairmont Gold rooms and the dedicated concierge, lounge and breakfast room is based at one corner near the elevators. We had a room facing Copley Square which provided excellent views. The windows are double glazed, so it was very quiet.While the cost of the Gold rooms is more than the normal guest rooms, the inclusions make up for the difference. For example, the buffet breakfast with waiter service is free, the internet is free, overnight shoe shine is free and you have access to a large lounge area with an open fire, newspapers, games etc. The breakfast was excellent and it was very easy to walk from your room to the lounge area each morning. The Gold staff was delightful, friendly, personal and extremely helpful. For example, we locked our selves out of our room one morning and they prepared two more keys while we had breakfast, wrapping them in a huge red ribbon so we wouldn't miss them. The concierge even remembered our room number.Our experience at the Fairmont Copley Plaza was wonderful and really made our visit to Boston an enjoyable one. We would certainly recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a 4/5 star experience in Boston. We got an excellent rate online at the hotel's website and felt the rate was very good value when considering all the inclusions.

<Content>beautiful hotel, extraordinary experience I loved staying in this hotel. I was booked here purely by accident for the final night of a week-long business trip to Boston, and loved it. The service was top-notch, the room was plush, and the amenities left nothing to be desired. I would stay here again under any circumstances. I loved the room's decor and layout; the bathroom was stunningly designed (I even took photos for inspiration in my own home), and of course the hotel itself is remarkable to behold. The location is certainly convenient to many Boston attractions, such as the Public Garden. Great hotel.

<Content>Fantastic olde world charm On approach to this hotel i wasnt really impressed by the exterior . While fine it just didn't seem to live up to the pictures I'd seen on the hotel website. Well the old phrase, never judge a book by its cover was never more appropiate.On entering we were ushered in by tradionally uniformed doormen to a beautiful lobby and checked in. Our room wasnt ready and was asked to wait in the Oak Bar. Thirty inutes later i enquired if it was ready yet and they were extremely appologetic as it was not and handed me a token for free drinks. This was no hardship as the Oak Bar was beautifully resting with oak panneling and tradionally furnished in a gentleman club type manner or in a very tradional London hotel style manner. We were to spend a few evenings there and found it to be both vibrant with a classy air and popular with Bostonians. The cocktails may appear expensive but they are large and strong.In the lobby we noticed a black dog a labarodor i think and was informed that it was the hotel mascot called Catie Copley. Well i want that job as she was rubbed and loved by everyone and when not being cooed over she was asleep in her kennel.....a fantastic mascot.The room was ok, a mini suite but as it was on the inside overlooking a roof it seemed dark. The hotel has been renovated recently and though you knew that, the decorating seemed a little sombre. But the comfort and quality could not be faulted. I was a little disappointed that the internet wasnt free as in many American hotels but it wasnt as expensive as some European ones.We didn't dine in the hotel, but brunch was fantastic and the Oak Room was as classy as the Bar.The location of the hotel was fantastic close to many of Bostons sights and within walking distance of the city centre. If you are a shopper then there were two malls close by and of course Newbury Street which even with the 拢/$ rate in your favour will give your credit card/wallet a severe going over.The staff were attentive personable and above all professional.I would high recommend this hotel as a bastion of tranquility over and above the, seen it a million times sameness of the big chains

<Content>Magnificient hotel with superb service The Fairmont Copley Plaza is a magnificient hotel for its location, its building and for service. The hotel, a magnificient Renaissance building, stands in Copley Plaza near Boston Public Library, Trinity Church and Hancock Tower. Everything is within walking distance. The lobby is absolutely superb. Even if you don't stay at the hotel you should walk in !So is the service from the door to your room ! Great Fairmont service. Check-in was courteous and rapid.The room, although this is an historic building, is modern (obviously renovated) and spacious with all marble washrooms ! The bed is really confortable. The desk though is a little tight for work. There is internet access in the room. You really feel like your living a good life when you stay there !The fitness center is well equipped although in a small room.So fabulous historic hotel with modern amenities and superb service. I really enjoyed my stay at this Fairmont.

<Content>Great location and service Stayed in one of the 'Gold' rooms - which means you have your own floor with its own reception and also a dedicated lounge for all the people on the floor. First impressions of the hotel were that the location was excellent - right in the heart of Boston and a very nice looking building from the outside. We walked into a massive lobby which did not appeal to me at all. It has a large busy railway station type vibe. Luckily we had our own check in on the 'Gold floor' - this went very smoothly and we were taken to our room (a double room for 2 people). We were very surprised by how tiny the room was! So we asked if we could change rooms and this was gladly done by the very nice and efficient lady at reception. We were taken to another room which was double the size! It had a few issues though. There was absolutely no storage space, the shower power was poor, and the TV was in a very odd position and very far away from the bed so we never even ended up watching it at all. However we had a great stay and the service was excellent - including the reception and room serice. I would definetly return.

<Content>historic, great location This is a classy hotel in a great location in the center of the city. We stayed here just for a one night getaway and we were happy. The room was very nice, large, incredibly decorated and clean. The steak house in the hotel is one of Boston's best and the dog that lives in the lobby is fun to play with. It is in a great location where you can walk to a lot of things and is near several stations and also the Amtrak/commuter rail station.

<Content>Over rated Over Priced I recently stayed at the hotel. The standard room although renovated was still shabby in some detail. The room is uncomfortable other than for sleeping. No place to sit. Extremely over priced even at a discounted rate I received.

<Content>Not a true 5 star hotel This is a clean and elegant hotel in a great location BUT if a hotel is going to charge 5 star rates, it has to deliver 5 star rooms and ours was not. It was tiny. Worse, the small closet was completely taken up by the mini bookcase containing the safe. Our clothes could not hang all the way down. The bathroom is also tiny and to make matters worse, there is no place in the bathroom for any toiletries or other supplies. There is only one shelf and the sink. All of our things were on the one small shelf and the desk in the room. For these prices, you can do better in the area.

<Author>Molecatcher
<Content>Lovely Hotel, very central. Stayed 5 nights at the end of our New England tour to celebrate 'molecatcher's' 60th Birthday! We had booked a room on the 'Gold' floor (well worth the extra) but were disappointed to be given an inside room with a view overlooking the central well and the noisy extractor vents. We were told that the hotel was full and we could not be moved for 2 days, but after our first sleepless night we threatened to check out unless an alternative was offered. The Gold Team were extremely helpful and came up with a delightful front room along with a bottle of wine on ice and a box of chocolates to celebrate the Birthday! After this faulty start everything was perfect and we had a wonderful stay in Boston. The breakfasts and evening canapes were outstanding with 24 hour access to free chilled soft drinks and an extensive honesty bar. There are 2 PCs in the lounge with free internet access in addition to WiFi for laptops in each bedroom. We mostly ate out but on our last night enjoyed a memorable meal in the Oak Room Restaurant (huge portions) beautifully cooked and well served. We looked into several other Boston Hotels but none were as elegant as the Fairmont and we would certainly stay here again on a future visit, happily paying the extra for the 'Gold' floor.

<Content>Great hotel, superb location We arrived after a good flight from London at about 2.30 in the afternoon, unfortunately our room was not ready, and would not be ready till about 4, 1 hour after it should have been. Not a great start but we were in an upbeat mood, so we went for a wander to get our bearings and pick up some brochures on the freedom trail etc. Arrived back at 4pm to be told it was 10 mins away from being ready. Staff were very apologetic and gave us frree drinks vouchers for the Oak Room and that they would come and get us once room was free. This they did and we were in our room at 4.15 ish.Room was better than we expected ( a fairmont room) a good size, clean and had that aged look without being old ( if you know what i mean!) The lobbey was very elegant, the dog (katie copley i think) pulled on the heart strings of my wife, and the service throughout our stay of 4 nights was top class. For a large hotel it still manages to be personel which is a credit to them. Location is superb. We walked everywhere and the start of the Freedom Trail is a lovely 10 min walk away at Boston Common. We had a meal in the Oak Room one evening and apart from being a lovely setting in the style of British Army Officers Hall, the meal and service was outstanding. Pasquelle our waiter was obvoiusly an experienced chap and it showed. Not a cheap meal , with wine and tip $300 but well worth it in our opinion. Would certainly stay at this hotel again. Loved Boston.

<Content>very nice As I walked into the hotel the doorman was oblivious to my wife and I as he continued to talk with another employee in language that would be offensive to most people. That was the only bad experience had here. The Lobby staff were friendly and helpfull the common areas and function rooms are gorgeous. As this is an old hotel I was worried that the room would be cramped and out of style it was a pleasant surprise to find that that assumption was wrong. The room was large enough and very modern. The restauarant was very pricey but the food was good and the service even better. If you are celebrating a special ocassion and price isnt an issue thier restaurant The oak room is a great choice. After dinner we had a drink and listened to live jazz in the lounge it capped off a totally enjoyable evening. I would reccomend this hotel to just about any type of party.

<Content>Lovely hotel A hotel in the grand old style, but with fantastic, unintimidating service. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The rooms were truly lovely, spacious, clean and luxurious. Breakfast was outstanding (too much of it really). You have a real feeling this is a special place to stay. I would highly recommend it.

<Content>Phenomenal The place to stay in Boston's Back Bay. A beautifully restored historic building.Rooms are spacious, with every amenity.The beds are absolutely divine!Spend the extra $90 or so per night for the Gold Floor, and you get a wonderful breakfast, evening hors d'oeuvres on weekdays (so good you could forego dinner), a selection of DVD's to take to your room, and use of the exclusive Gold Floor check-in and concierge.The staff - I can't say enough wonderful things about them. Courteous, helpful, and friendly. Special mention to the concierge Jim Carey.And of course the Fairmont Copley Plaza's resident Canine Ambassador Catie Copley - a friendly black lab who spends her days in the lobby greeting everyone. Guests can even take Catie for a walk around the neighborhood.

<Content>Very Consistent Service We had to come to Boston for a medical appointment at the world renowned, Mass General Hospital. It was a 2 week long stay and can truly say the service and staff courteousness was very very consistent and genuinely nice and followup was always made by any request we ever had.The only inconsistency in service I can comment on is housekeeping, some days, we would get 5 hand towels, most days the shampoos/shower gels were not replenished, some days the kleenex box was not replenished.However, despite this in housekeeping, was always impressed that even though a couple times, we didn't leave the room until mid afternoon, the room attendants still managed to clean our room during the small window of time they had until their shifts were over.The staff were all very professional and unpretentious. Obviously very convenient location, and due to our long stay, we were able to find some inexpensive take-out bistros nearby for good but fast inexpensive food across the way at Copley Place and Prudential Center.

<Content>Good Location Nice looking central hotel. Grandiose lobby and entrance area and rooms nicely done and spacious enough. On the down-side, we had to ask 4 times for the cot that we'd pre-booked to be brought to the room, the only lifts can be a very long walk from your room and the service for breakfast in the Oak Room deteriotaed over the 3 mornings from ok to very poor.

<Content>Hotel is beautiful, but a bit tired Stayed at the Fairmont Copley Plaza for 2 nights at the end of August for a meeting. Hotel facilities were beautiful and of historic significance. Check in was seemless. Rooms were large, but furnishings were a bit tired. Bed was comfortable, rooms - facing back to central courtyard were quiet. Room service was pricey but food came quickly and was both good and still hot when it arrived! Meeting facilities were great. Food and beverage service was excellent - especially liked meeting breakout snack option that donated a portion of the proceeds back to a local charity! Great location, friendly and professional staff.

<Content>Grand old hotel....love that dog! The Fairmont in Boston is pretty nice, as far as old, grand hotels go, though it is showing some signs of age. Our room, with taxes and valet parking was approx. $500/night. For that price I would have expected a little more. The armoire with the television had one broken door, so it had to remain open and couldn't be closed. The carpeting was slightly shabby and the overall decor was worn out.The highlight of the Fairmont is the lovely Oak Room and the bar. Although ghastly expensive for cocktails, it is a blast from the past. Really elegant in every respect.I'd stay again just to see Catie Copley, the Fairmont's resident Labrador Retriever. What a precious dog! You can even check her out for walks!

<Content>Gold floor - Great family vacation Best:- great location, great neighborhood for shopping, restaurants, strolling. One block from T and one block from Amtrak station at Back Bay.- great free breakfast in lounge. I think they say it's a limited service, but it's a big buffet. Hot dishes were usually eggs and potatoes. Bagels, english muffins, breads, superb croissants, pastries, coffee cake, smoked salmon, oatmeal, yoghurt, fruits, cheese, and more. Several fantastic staff are working very hard to refill coffee, clear plates, and make sure everything is going great.- free coffee, water, juice, and soft drinks all day.- free hors d'oervres every evening rotate through different Boston themes (e.g. North End = Italian etc...)- Great spacious room. Great bathroom.- relaxed atmosphere with a wide variety of clients. You don't feel like you have to dress up to go to breakfast, but you don't have kids throwing cheerios at you either.- free internet (ethernet) in room and two PCs available in the lounge. Wireless also supposed to be available.Not the best:- service was a little inconsistent. Gold floor staff were always smiling, friendly, and polite. As noted in other reviews, bellman/doormen don't seem to do much. Evening turn-down came late or not at all. Check-in/out seemed almost too casual. No paperwork, no questions. They just gave me the keys when I arrived and took them back when I left.- cable TV choices seemed a bit limited. Mostly news and sports. No disney, no nick, no bravo, no ifc and so on.- lounge has DVDs that you can borrow for free to play in the room, but the selection is pathetic.

<Content>Loved the Fairmont We just returned from a 5 night stay on the Gold floor of the Fairmont Copely Plaza. The service was outstanding! The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. At any given time there were 3-5 concierges serving the Gold floor. They were extremely accommodating and gave excellent restaurant recommendations. The hotel was across the street from the T and 2 blocks away from the shopping on Newbury Street. What a location! The extra money to stay on the Gold floor is definitely worth it! We will look to stay here again in the future.

<Content>Great historic Hotel We stayed at the fairmont at the end of June for 4 nights. The hotel creates a good impression from the outside and this continues in the Grand Lobby area, although they could do with more doormen to greet guests as we had to struggle with our own luggage which wasn't great.The first room we were allocated was small, dark and smelled of cigarette smoke so we requested an alternative and were moved along the hall to a much bigger and better room.Although we did not eat in the hotel we did try the Oak room bar for drinks and we found it very pleasant.The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping at the malls and designer shops nearby and is within walking distance to almost everything in Boston you would want to see as a tourist.On the whole I would recommend this hotel if you can get a decent rate as the location can't be beaten and it really is a beautiful Hotel (if you get a good room!)

<Content>Great location but thats all ! I stayed here for 3 nights a few weeks ago with my husband and 2 kids. we usually stay at the Sheraton but that was fully booked.The location is great and staff were very helpful and courteous and the lobby is very grand but i wasn't that impressed.The houskeeping service was very poor. we weren't given any replacement toilet rolls or shampoo etc.You dont expect this in an expensive deluxe hotel.This is the first hotel in the US that I've stayed in that didn't have a coffee maker in the room. There was a $10 rental charge for one.there was a basket of cookies/sweets etc on display as part of the mini bar that I was afraid my kids would try to eat in the middle of the night resulting in big charges to the bill!! However according to the information folder there was quite a large charge to get all this removed.Restaurant very expensive. we went up to the Marriott in copley place instead and had great buffet breakfasts from some of the most helpful restaurant staff that i have ever encountered.We visit Boston every year and will stick to the sheraton or marriott next time

<Content>Great location, grand lobby, so-so room I stayed at the Fairmont for a conference that was taking place in the hotel. The location is really great. I hadn't spent much time in this area of Boston before, and I really enjoyed the area. In addition, the hotel facade, entryway, and especially the lobby are undeniably impressive. If you are used to bland chain hotels, it's certainly fun to stay at a posh, red-velvet kind of place occasionally.The hotel restaurant was very formal with a strict dress code. We ate one night at the bar instead, which was very nice, with lots of dark wood and comfortable seating. The menu was a bit limited and seemed generally overpriced. On the other hand, there are many, many good restaurants within easy walking distance. The concierge was very approachable and helpful in choosing places to eat, providing area maps, and giving directions. The area seemed safe and walkable at night -- lots of people about. One night we took a nice stroll down Commonwealth Ave (with lighted trees) to the Boston Public Garden after dinner.As for the room itself, I was less impressed. (I had the same experience at the San Francisco Fairmont years ago -- the public areas are very well-kept and impressive, but the rooms are small and somewhat show their age. It is a 100 year old building, after all, so I guess it's not surprising. Also, I think the rooms might vary quite a bit. A colleague signed up for the frequent-guest club at registration, and she said her room was quite large and comfortable. I did not sign up, and maybe they put me in a less-nice room since I was also paying a discounted conference room rate. When I got to the room, I could hear and feel the cold wind whistling through my window, which was open a couple of inches. It was completely stuck and would not close. When I called, they sent a facilities guy within a few minutes who banged on the window frame for a few minutes with a hammer, then partially unscrewed it and reset it in its tracks while I waited and he did get it to close. Needless to say, I did not risk opening the window again for the rest of my stay. The bathroom was very pleasant, with a period feel to it, and very nice soaps/shampoos, etc. The bed was comfortable, no complaints. I would have wanted a larger desk if I was doing much serious work from the room. It was decent, but somewhat cramped.All in all, I still give it four stars because the building, ambience, and location are definitely above average. Just be aware that you might run into a few quirks due to the hotel's age.

<Content>Wow, a wonderful hotel Our family of four stayed at this hotel on our recent visit to Boston.The rooms are quite spacious and nicely decorated. Particularly outstanding are the concierge services with regard to directions, restaurants and obtaining tickets. All the staff were found to be friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this centrally located hotel.

<Content>Great location This hotel did all the big things right,but forgot the little stuff.I am a member of presidents club.Used an u/g cert for a suite.Received a very spacious corner room looking out at Trinity Square.King bed,renovated bathroom/room,nice suite attachment.Check-in staff,bellman,concierge(Sarah) Oak room restaurant staff,room cleaning staff all top notch and extremely pleasant.The Oak room restaurant provided us with one of the better meal experiences we have enjoyed in quite a while.Only issue was fruit flies, seemed to be everywhere in Boston.The little issues were ,no paper delivery in am,no turndown service on 2 of 4 nights(one came at 10 pm ????) and the water that should have been provided(all part of platinum membership)A little noisy.Windows are not soundproofed.I would definately stay here again,The location,city,weather, all provided an experience that says I want to come back.

<Content>Great old hotel! We stayed here for one night 7/19 as we were going to Fenway to see the Red Sox that night. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful and grand. There are beautiful flowers everywhere and I love the hotel's dog who sits in the lobby. When we checked in they would not honor any upgrade (probably because we got the room on priceline) so we were stuck with a moderate queen room. It was a very small room on the second floor with no view. It was very clean and the decor was nice but it was very small. That was the only draw back to the hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful and the location is wonderful. The T is right across the street as well as the Hancock tower. They would not let us into the oak room for last call because they said that we were too late( 12:10) so we went across the street to the Westin. Overall a nice hotel but if you are looking for a nice room with great views of the city try the Westin across the street. It's rooms are much nicer,they have better facilities (they have a pool) and they have a very fun and lively bar that is open later than the Fairmonts.

<Content>Best old lady I've seen I've stayed in many old grand dame hotels -- the Waldorf-Astoria, the Willard, etc., and I was a bit leary of the Fairmont Copley Plaza. Sure it had a great location and reputation, but I've always been disappointed in the past with these older hotels. All in all I needn't have worried, however. The bed and bedding was excellent, perhaps consistently (all 6 nights) the best hotel sleep I've had.I'd probably go so far as 5 stars, but for a couple complaints regarding the bathroom -- we apparently were put in the handicap-accessible room (which is fine), but there was no way to prop open the bathroom door (it was on a strong springed hinge -- how do people in wheelchairs even manage?), and the bath vent fan wasn't working. This made for stuffy times in the bathroom, particularly on humid late June afternoons.Then there were what appears to be a common feature nowadays -- the stray hair that's obviously not yours. (We were two short-haired men staying in the room, so I know the foot-long black curl was not ours!) I don't know if I've ever been to a hotel where the bathroom cleanliness met my expectations, but at the Fairmont Copley Plaza the truly bizarre thing was that the number of extraneous hairs *increased* from day to day. Was the maid pulling out her own hair in frustration at the spring-loaded door? Was the Fairmont laundry not up to the challenge of removing hair from towels and mats? Who knows, but I know taht I was oscillating between disgusted and amused as the amount of stray hair increased over our 6 days.

<Content>Go for a cocktail, stay somewhere else I had stayed here 7 years ago, and it was not good to go back. This hotel is a sad shadow of its former glory, living on a reputation its not keeping up. For the price go get a room at the Marriot/ Sheraton - anywhere that will be newer, just as great a location and cleaner/ newer/ quieter rooms. The plumbing is ancient - if a room above or near has a bath you can hear them turn off the taps, the rooms look tired and dowdy, and the hotel is more geared up for weddings - of which there were two the weekend we stayed than for travellers. Go and have a look at the ceiling in the lobby, have a cocktail in the Oak Room but don't stay here, its a waste of money, which is such a shame. There is so much better in Boston.

<Content>The "Moderate" Rooms are very bad! While the Fairmont is a lovely hotel in terms of the excellent location, the lobby and room decor, beware if you end up in a Moderate Room. This review is written for those who book the Fairmont Copley Plaza through a 3rd party vendor such as Expedia or travel agency, use credit card points, or end up there due to a bid on Priceline, like I did. If you check the hotel's website, you will see they offer more guest room classes than most hotels. I don't think the Moderate Room is even offered if you call Fairmont reservations directly, it is reserved for people who book through the sources I mentioned above. While the Moderate Room itself is decorated fine, a bit small (beware - queen bed only, no choice of a king or double beds), and the bathroom cramped, it would be bearable if it were not for the HORRIBLE SMELL. We were on the 1st floor (the hotel only has 6 floors) and there was a strong stench of sewer plus the smoke from adjacent smoking rooms permeate our non-smoking room. They actually have smoking and non-smoking rooms in the same hallway. It was not a pleasant night of sleep and we had a young child who smelled like a cigarette in the morning. The housekeeping staff even told my husband this was the worst wing of the hotel and we should have them move us.They were fully booked the 1st night, but upon request on the second night we were moved to a Fairmont Room with a king bed on a floor with no smells. I am sure that many guests complain about these Moderate Rooms and the hotel staff is used to moving guests to better rooms if available.What I find disappointing is a four star hotel such as the Fairmont even offers such rooms, albeit at a discount, to unsuspecting guests. These are second tiers rooms that are probably not even worth the discounted rate paid by guests. This experience has really turned me off of using Priceline and staying at any Fairmont properties.One other point, it was mentioned to me on more than once occasion by hotel staff that I used Priceline, why should they care, I am a paying guest.

<Content>The gold in the entrance clearly hides a very poor service and bad rooms. We are used to traveling all over the world and we always choose the finest hotels in the center of the cities. We came to Boston this year to attend our daughter鈥檚 ceremony of graduation from Harvard Business School. We had reserved two rooms in January 2007, via our local travel agency in France Carlson Wagonlit. We had the following booking: from the 6th of June until the 10th of June 2007 (4 nights) for 1216鈧?per room without breakfast. It was specified on the booking that we wanted a non-smoking room. Choice of hotelDuring our previous stays in Boston, we were at the OMNI PARKER HOUSE. Having seen the beautiful entrance of the FAIRMONT hotel, we wanted to try it for our next stop in Boston. We booked the rooms as soon as we had the exact schedule for the graduation ceremony. The roomsOur local travel agency, Carlson Wagonlit had sent a confirmation email before we arrived and specified again that we wanted a VIP non-smoking room. 1/ At our arrival, we were surprised to be offered rooms in the second floor that were so strongly smelling cigarettes that we needed to ask to change rooms. 2/ We went back to the reception to ask for them and were offered new rooms on the 4th floor with an additional $70 per night !!!!! 3/ We naturally refused this arrangement and were finally offered two new rooms on the 3d floor. The rooms鈥?windows were facing the interior of the hotel, while we specifically had asked for room facing the street in our booking! And the rooms were not side by side.Inside the roomsThere was no plug for the ironer (we miraculously found one lost under the bed). No plug to fit European wires for our mobile phone (we had to ask the front desk to bring us adaptor). In one of the rooms, there was no armchair but only one chair in front of the desk. The carpet was stained (as in the corridor).In the bathroomsHaving the restrooms inside the bathroom is very unusual for premium hotels and very uncomfortable. There was only one small sink. The bath was in very bad shape. The toilet flush was making noise for a few minutes after flushing!!!!The overall aspect of the bathroom was old and rusty. The noiseWe have been awaken at 6am two days in a row by water noises coming from outside rooms. The same noise occurred again at night. There must be a bad system of water plumbing overall. ServiceWe asked for slippers for the bathroom and were simply told that there is none! The Business Center is supposed to offer internet access but was out of order. We had to ask for a computer to be brought in the room and wait for someone to bring it and plug it. The service has been charged 40$!Housekeeping is not well done: there are still old tissues on the corridors, meal plates from breakfast in other rooms for a long time, glasses on the floor etc. We consider that the high price for the room is not aligned with the bad quality of the experience.

<Content>Nice - but wouldn't return We booked a room using our American Express points. We used 45,000 points, which included a room for one night, breakfast, tax and tip. We had to upgrade to a Signature room for an additional $50 because no standard rooms were available.I'll start off with the positives. The location is really great - it's right next to Trinity Church, a couple of blocks from Newbury St, and a short walk to the Public Garden. Perfect for out-of-towners. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful - it's very ornate. The Oak Room restaurant is also beautiful - the fresh flowers are gorgeous. We had breakfast there, which was very good. The fitness room is sufficient - it has nice equipment, but it is very small and doesn't offer lots of different equipment. It's fine for a quick workout.We arrived in Boston on a red eye. We had called the day before and asked for an early check-in. They said they would do their best to honor our request. When we arrived at about 9 am, they said no rooms were available and check-in time was 3:00. They took our voucher and checked us in. Maybe I'm cynical, but I find it hard to believe that not one person had checked out early that morning. But we gave them the benefit of the doubt and they offered to call us when our room was ready. We gave them our cell phone number. Unfortunately, they don't have spa facilities, so we freshened up on the first floor bathroom. People looked at us, wondering if we were homeless people. Anyway, we walked around town and returned to our hotel at 2:15 pm. We had never received a phone call. When we returned to the hotel, they said our room was ready. There was no mention of the fact that they were supposed to call us. She looked in the computer and asked for our voucher. We explained that we had already given it to the person who had checked us in that morning. And then she asked for identification. Honestly, I was taken aback. I have never been asked for ID in any hotel I've stayed at, high or low end. I'm not sure what the point of that was, but after not having received a call to let us know our room was ready, it left a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe I was over-sensitive because I was tired.Our room was fine. We stayed in 229. I'm not sure how it was different from a standard size room. I can't make a comparison since I haven't seen a standard room, but it had the normal bed, desk, and armchair configuration. I asked specifically whether the room was a signature room, and the person who checked us in said it was. The bathroom was very small, especially for a hotel of this caliber. There was only one sink, and it was cramped. The bathtub abutted the sink, and the shower curtain wasn't long enough to hide the sink area. There was no fan in the bathroom, so it got steamy pretty quickly. We had one window, and the view from our room was over the square of Trinity Church, but it was obstructed by a flag pole and the top of the front entry. The closet light wasn't working, which wouldn't have been too much of a problem except that was where the only full-length mirror was. Our sheets were scratchy.All in all, we had an okay stay. The best part was the location. I was a bit put off by the service - it wasn't up to par for this level of hotel. Maybe it was because we used our American Express points. If that's really the case, they should discontinue the program. We wouldn't upgrade to a signature room again because we didn't really see any benefit. Maybe we got some extra floor space, but it didn't add anything to the room. Next time, we'll stay at the Ritz or the Four Seasons. We would have stayed there this time, but they were booked.

<Content>VERY pleased!! highly recommend after reading some older reviews about disappointed guests  god forbid mice in the room, I immediately called my husband to see if we could cancel. we couldn't-or at least, he wasn't going to! SO glad that we didn't. Its definitely worth the extra money (and you save it later!!) if you stay on the 4th floor Gold Club level. you will be treated like royalty-immediately we walked off the elevator and were greeted by name. They gold club is the hospitality or concierge area that includes a library with books  DVDs you can borrow, chess  scrabble set up, a private office with computer/printer/internet, formal living room, dining area  kitchen-the best part!! they serve breakfast (we're talking full buffet-not just continental), happy hour with appetizers  cookies before bed. Throughout the day you have full access to the coffee, bar  coolers filled with beverages, bottled water, beers, juices, etc. the only charge is for wine/beer/ cocktaails and its the honor system- $5 per drink (very reasonable for Boston!).considering we ate breakfast there every morning and also had drinks  hors dourves a few times in the late afternoon we definitely saved money and feel the upgrade was wonderful  well worth it! Also, it was great to stop at the concierge desk and get suggestions/directions/weather report/ reservations, etc on our way in or out.I honestly can say our stay was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful (on all levels-not just the 4th floor!).

<Content>Buyer Beware! This was a one night stay so my contact with the hotel was limited. I thought the front desk and it's President's Club Check in was a model of efficiency. My room was a rather strange one. I assume that when the hotel opened in 1913, this was two tiny rooms with a shared bath. As it is now configured, one of the rooms is a tiny two armchair and a desk sitting room, the other a bedroom with an armoire holding a TV and the minibar. The bathroom is between these rooms. A little odd and were I staying longer I would have requested something else. The bathroom is fine, the cleanliness unquestionable and the bed comfortable. I was pleased to see that one of the benefits of memembership in the President's Club is free internet access. Unfortunately, I use WiFi so much that I'd left my ethernet card at home and could not be connected through the hotel system. This led to an unfortunate use of the lobby work stations which are pay per use and I ended with a staggering $30.50 bill for 13 minutes of service and the printing a boarding pass. Buyer beware.There is no business center here and that I think is a major debit for this property.

<Content>Don't judge a book by it's cover ? Fairmont Copley Plaza*******************My wife and I stayed at the Plaza during the last weeks of May.Externally impressive with its imposing fa莽ade and location within Copley square, the hotel is worthy of its status as an American Heritage property.The gilded hallway leading to reception also gave the feel of quality, however at check in it became obvious that we could have been staying in any old city hotel.As we approached the desk the young receptionist switched to autopilot and autocue and asked her obligatory list of Yes / No book-in questions; unfortunately by now we gained the impression that we were no longer special, despite $600 per night.Our room was large and located on an upper floor with a view over the square. The room was clean, tidy and well serviced but lacked character.( I suppose like most hotel rooms but not what you鈥檇 expect here). The decoration although fresh had a distinctly DIY finish, particularly in the marble bathroom.The walk in corner wardrobe was a joke, and I鈥檇 expect even the great Houdini would have had difficulty getting in and out of it successfully.The Oak room restaurant served up a decent breakfast and dinner - at a price. The Oak room bar certainly had lots of character and came to life in the evenings - this helped to relieve the general staid and lacklustre feel to the hotel.Despite our gripes which may sound a bit petty, we enjoyed our stay in the 鈥済rand old dame鈥? but would we stay again 鈥?No - We鈥檝e stayed in better.Would we stay in Boston 鈥?YES - What a tremendous city.

<Content>Still very good I first stayed at the Copley Plaza over 19 years ago when I arrived with my parents to start studying at Boston Univeristy. While it doesn't quite feel like the same grand old hotel anymore, my recent stay there with my husband was quite lovely. Our room was a very decent size (although for a 'deluxe' I did expect something a little bigger) and although the bathroom was small and we had no view from our window, neither put a damper on things. The staff was helpful and courteous and the location simply does not get any better.Katie, the resident black lab in the lobby, added an amazing touch to the whole place. She greeted us every day on our way in and out and posed quite happliy for pictures with her new book.I do have to agree with the reviewer who mentioned the weird smell in the room. We were constantly leaving our window open to get rid of it. Since we get a very decent corporate rate through my husband's company I would stay there again for sure.

<Content>Fantasic stay Overall fantastic experience. I arrived at 10:30 in the morning and received great service from the first hello. The front desk staff was very cordial and found a room for me. The room was very nice and well appointed. Bed was very comfortable. Sean at the Concierge desk was very helpful on two fronts: dinner reservation and getting me an appointment with a fantastic barber. Overall nothing but positives. Looking forward to my next visit.

<Content>I fell in love on this visit to Boston My sister and I just returned from a girls weekend away together in Boston. This is a fine hotel in a wonderful location. Very close to major shopping areas as well as Newbury Street where we found many great dining choices. Hotel is also close to the subway which is cheap and safe.We stayed on Fairmont Gold for our three nights. This is the club level on the 4th floor. It does cost $100 extra per night to stay but is well worth it. Make sure to meet the club level manager,John, while you're there. He's somewhat like Irelands' answer to James Bond, most charming!!Room was clean and everyone was so polite and sweet, including the housekeepers, every morning! Good value for money. Had a drink in the Oak Bar which was unforgettable, felt very grand! I would strongly recommend this hotel, especially the Gold level if you can afford it!!!

<Content>Doesn't feel like a four star hotel... To be honest, I expected more from a Fairmont hotel. While the Fairmont Copley Plaza is situated in a beautiful, historic building, you don't really get much in return for the price you pay to stay in this hotel. The mini-bar prices are absolutely outrageous ($7 for a bottle of water!), and the internet fees are ridiculous ($14/day). Luckily, I am a member of their President's Club so I did not have to pay the daily internet fee. Though the hotel is in a great location and right next an enormous indoor mall, we were given a room with no view, and the furniture was rather old and musty looking. I expected a better room (perhaps with an actual view) for a President's Club member. I would not stay at this hotel again...I would recommend the Bulfinch hotel which is also in downtown Boston, cheaper, and nicer rooms without the outrageous prices!

<Content>Negative Review In the three nights we stayed at this property, we occupied three different rooms, not by choice, of course. First, we found a large wet spot on the carpet, and asked to be moved. The new room ended up being smaller than the first one, but we stayed anyway. Second, our door key reader did not work, so we asked for help. After an hour spent standing in the hallway while the security staff tried to fix the door (we were given no timeframe for how long this was going to take), we were finally packed off to another room because they couldn't fix it. The bellman came by, handed us the new keys, and didn't even bother to help us with our bags. The only staff who expressed any level of concern for our comfort and inconvenience were the housekeeping staff; the security, front desk and bell staff were not helpful and lacked customer service skills. We will not stay at this property again.

<Content>A Four Star Nightmare! I have stayed in several hotels in Boston, ranging from 2 to 4 stars, and I have to say, I'll stay in the Ho-Jo at Fenway before I stay at this terrible hotel! First, the heater was pumping 80* into the room with no relief, and the window that should have opened did not. The bed was a double, not a queen-size, which is what we had paid for and even been told at the front desk we were supposed to get.The worst by far was when we tried to finally sleep- there was a loud obnoxious party across the hall. By 12:30 at night I had called 4 times to the front desk to do something about it. *Four times!* Security did not do anything about it, and by the final time, I went downstairs in my PJ's to tell them it wasn't being taken care of. Their Four Star security was just standing around on their walkie talkies while the party continued with the doors wide opened. I finally stated we'd be willing to switch to another room. So, at 1 in the morning, we packed up our stuff and had to move to another room. And the 2nd room smelled like something had died in it. Luckily the heater wasn't broken in this one, but the odor was horrible. We decided to make the best of it, because clearly telling the apathetic staff at this hotel that anything is wrong is a waste of energy. The next morning I spoke to the manager and told him of the awful experience. I told him if we wanted a party across the hall from us keeping us up at all hours of the night with a small bed and a broken air system in the room we would have stayed at a 1 or 2 star motel/hotel. But, instead, we had opted to pay hundreds of dollars to stay in their Four Star hotel for only one night. There was no mention of taking anything off the bill or comping our stay. All he did was offer up a free upgrade and free breakfast the next time we stayed at The Fairmont Copley Plaza. Which, of course, will never happen again. Save your hundreds of dollars you'll spend on this joke of a four star.

<Content>Unsurpassed My daughters and I just spent a week in New England and started our trip at the Copley Plaza. I had never stayed there before and now I will never stay anywhere else in Boston! I haven't enjoyed such truly outstanding, caring service, in many years. We arrived at 5:30 a.m. in the morning after a red-eye flight. We were assured that not only was our room ready for us (on the Gold floor), but we had been upgraded to a suite for our stay. The suite (the Boston Symphony Orchestra Suite) was a treasurehouse of photographs, posters, and scores from the Boston Symphony and a beautifully decorated suite with a view of Copley Square. Breakfast on the club floor is amazing. The first morning I went down very late and the lovely young server cooked us a beautiful breakfast to order well after normal breakfast hours. Similarly, our waiter the next two mornings not only served us beautifully but took extra care to find out what my daughters wanted to do in Boston and to give us map guidance, restaurant, and shopping suggestions; then inquired how we had enjoyed everything the next morning. Every staff person we encountered was outstanding. On the last day, as we loaded our suitcases into our rented car for our car trip through New England, the doorman retrieved our bags for us and then guided us across all lanes of traffic so that we could safely turn onto I-90. We also felt that Katie, the local black Lab, lent a sweet, homey touch to the lobby, which is elegant and relaxing.I just can't say enough good about this hotel! Now everything else will pale in comparison!

<Content>Nice Room  We had a special, low conference rate, so I assume our room was at the lower end. Altho we did not have a view, the room more than met our expectations - large, nicely decorated,  clean, with beautiful marble bathrm, which was larger than expected. Location cannot be beat, walking distance to shops, restaurants, museums, public garden, Charles River. Altho no coffee makers in the room, Starbucks is just outside the hotel, and an Au Bon Pan is across the street. On the down side, the room was very hot and heat could not be turned down. We put fan on, and turned temp to cool but it still blew hot air. Ended up opening window, even though it was freezing outside. Also, bath was nicely updated, but lighting was poor. You really needed heat lamp on to get enough light. Not a problem in March, but might not be so pleasant in August. The gilded lobby is impressive, but very geared to conferences. No place to really sit comfortably and read, or have a drink. It was extremely busy with hotel guests waiting to check in, conference attendees milling about, and registration tables for different conferences lining the lobby wall. Too bad some of that luxury wasn't reserved for a quiet area where hotel guests could relax in comfortable seating, away from the conference action.

<Content>Solid Choice The Fairmont is a solid choice for business travellers. Was attending a conference at the Marriot Copley and the Fairmont had a lot more character than the Westin or Marriot where colleagues were staying.Oak Room is a nice place for a drink in the evenings and the breakfast included with my room was good. Bathroom had been renovated, and tolietries were provided as you'd expect from at $300 night hotel.Only stayed one night, but would stay again on future trips to Boston.Downside was cost of valet parking at $39 per night. Room I had on 6th Floor #609 was right across from elevator, but noise didn't bother probably because I so was so tired.

<Content>Fairmont Gold Level - Try it! My husband and I were looking for a well needed night of rest, relaxation and pampering (we haven't gone away since having our 14 month old); and we certainly went to the right place! The Gold Level at the Fairmont was a real find. The staff catered to our every wish from making our dinner reservation to booking massages and delivering Champagne and fresh squeezed orange juice to our room for mimosas with breakfast. The Gold Level had a surprisingly elaborate spread of appetisers at the nightly cocktail hour including wine, cheese and shrimp cocktail, as well as a full breakfast including eggs, delicious breads and pastries, and fresh squeezed juices. We highly recommend upgrading to the Fairmont - Gold Level!

<Content>Lived up to my Expectations We stayed on the Fairmont Copley Plaza on Feb 24th as a birthday surprise for my husband. I had done careful research before booking and the hotel was everything I expected it to be and more. We stayed on the club level floor where the private conceirge was extremely helpful to all of our requests for directions, recommendations, special requests for our room and even got us a reservation at the Oak Bar when we were told by the restaurant that it was booked solid. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. The only minor complaint I had was that the furniture was not arranged so as to allow easy access to the great view of the plaza below (The desk was in front of the window). We had a great time and will go back again.

<Content>memories interfered with judgement? I stayed again at the Copley Plaza because of memories of it in grander days. The lobby cafe is gone. The informal bar is gone. The picture of Senator Kennedy is gone. Much more of the hotel is given to meetings.  The Club level lounge charges for a glass of wine and provides careful appetizers. The Club level concierges were, however, helpful and competent, and room service was faster than in the old days.  Our window on Copley Square was the same size it has always been, but seemed tiny alongside the spectacular 180 degree vista of the Square and of Boston from an inexpensive corner Junior Suite at the Westin Copley Place, across the street. The Westin has an informal bar, an uncareful breakfast buffet, and an array of restaurants in the adjoing mall, where we mostly continued to eat while staying at the Copley Plaza. We would stay at the Westin Copley Place next time, perhaps walk across for a formal drink in the Oak Bar and to pat the great dog in the Copley Plaza lobby, but sadly leave the former grande dame to her conventions.

<Content>What a place to grab a drink! I have traveled the world and seen many a bar in my life. The Oak Bar in the Fairmont Copley Hotel is absolutely amazing! Style, class and service are exceptional here. I recomend it for an after dinner cocktail while out on the town. The drink list is extensive, the service was great, the band was incredible and the atmosphere was A+.

<Content>Decadent rooms! I stayed in a deluxe room with a view of Coply Square and it was a great experience. The room was richly decorated--very elegant-- and super clean. The bathroom was brand-new and very luxurious. My only complaint is that it was difficult to hang long items like jackets/dresses in the closet because of an obstruction at the bottom of the closet.

<Content>Gold Floor is a plus Stayed here for 3 nights in a Gold Signature Room. The Gold experience is well worth it. The service was great - both on the Ground and Gold Floors.Very good location - easy to get around the city from here.The Gold Floor is a real plus. The lounge areas and refreshments are a real treat after a hard day shopping or sightseeing. Breakfast was excellent.Only issue was a smell of sewage in our room at times. The Gold Floor receptionist was very sympathetic, but didn't actually do anything about it!

<Content>A Boston Brahmin tradition I stayed here 1 night for a business meeting. The hotel is perfectly situated on Copley Square, with multiple restaurants, endless shopping, and attractions (Trinity Church, Newbury St, Symphony Hall, Prudential Center) within easy walking distance. Copley Square station is right across the square, if you want to take the subway. You will be transported back to the age of the Boston Brahmins (and the Titanic), with a highly ornate gilded lobby and grand ballroom. The service is impeccable, if a bit obsequious. I had probably the smallest sized room, and it was still huge with nice, traditional furnishings and luxurious bedding. However, the age of the hotel also showed. The closet and bathroom were both tiny, the closet door would not close, and the toilet did not flush properly. The TV kept sliding out of the armoire because the floor was not quite level. This is the hotel if you want style and tradition. If you want a modern (and cheaper) business hotel, the Westin and Marriott are right next door.

<Content>Old World Charm, With Modern Amenities I have stayed here multiple times and love it every time. I am a Fairmont Premier member, and used a room upgrade certificate. We were upgraded to the museum of science, suite and WOW! It was gorgeously decorated and obviously quite spacious. It was a shame we were only there for a weekend getaway! Staff is always very accommodating and very helpful. Cannot beat the location, right in the heart of Boston. If you are coming by train the Back Bay Train station is located only a block away. Once again a wonderful stay, Fairmont will get my business again next time I am back in Boston!

<Content>The Hotel within a Hotel is awesome I had the fortunate chance of staying in one of the Gold rooms. What a great experience (except I did get a handicap enabled room which meant my bathroom was a bit too big and therefore drafty). The breakfast in the morning and the cocktail in the evening was great that they serve near reception. You have your own private reception/concierge desk for check in/check out. The hotel is also walking distance to loads of shopping - I did some serious damage. The bed was nice and everyone was super friendly. I'd love to stay here again, but my company paid for my visit so...

<Content>Mice love the Copley My wife and I spent the New Year weekend at the Copley Plaza. We arrived late on 12/29 and checked into room 218. Tired from the journey we showered and were ready to sleep, when my wife saw a rodent run from the wardrobe to the TV cabinet. At first I thought she was imagining things, but shortly after our little friend poked its head from behind the cabinet and did a number of mousy tricks. Horrified, my wife called the receptionist, who sent a member of staff to address the situation. The guy was lovely and his approach to mouse catching was rather comical. He was effectively trying to get the mouse out of its hiding place and into the corridor, in the process employing most of the reading material on the desk! Surely enough the mouse ran into the corridor 鈥?mission accomplished for the jolly chap from Copley Plaza, who proceeded to advise us to block the gap between the door and the floor with a towel to prevent mice from entering the room. At this point we realized that this had not been a unique incident for our new friend. My wife diligently followed his advice and had me look behind the furniture whenever we returned to the room. I never heard from Copley Plaza on the incident, not a word of apology or reassurance that hygiene was at the top of their minds. Maybe they are too busy maintaining the ornate decorum to address such minor details. It was a good thing that my wife and I had stayed in dives before while living in Asia, as we did not allow the hotel to spoil our enjoyment of beautiful Boston. We will go back to the city but not to the Copley Plaza!

<Content>Great Hotel, Perfect Location, Beautiful City Just recently returned from a 5 day trip to Boston over Christmas. What a fantastic city, full of beauty. It reminds me of a smaller New York but the people were friendlier and the architecture is lovely.The Fairmont was a great choice of hotel. Ideally situated for getting around and set in a beautiful square. The concierge Jim Carey was very knowledgable and very helpful. The standard rooms are a good size and the beds are very comfortable, especially after a long day sight seeing. The hotel also has a mascot, a 5 year old black labrador called Catie Copley who is absolutely divine. You can take her for walks, arranged through the concierge. Thoroughly enjoyed my trip to Boston and would definitely stay at The Fairmont again.

<Content>loved the lobby Stayed at the fairmont copley plaza in december on a four day visit to boston, on arrival we met with a porter who was not impressed with us offering to help with our bags, we were embarrassed that they were so heavy but the porter obviously thought we were trying to get out of tipping him!! He was quite rude and abrupt with us over this.. Other than this we enjoyed our stay here, location is good in a nice area. The hotel itself is lovely the lobby is very plush, the rooms were a bit on the small side but service etc was very good, the hotel restaurant the oak room is nice for a formal meal.

<Content>Needs a little work My husband and I just returned from a weekend stay at the Fairmont Copley. He had a conference there, so at the conference rate, the price of the room/quality of the hotel was good. I would not stay there for the full rate.The lobby is huge and ornate. It was festively decorated for Christmas. Several companies were having their holiday parties there both nights in the rooms off the lobby, which meant we had to navigate through large groups of smokers outside the hotel and smaller groups of somewhat intoxicated partyers inside the hotel.Our floor was a non-smoking floor, however, the smell of smoke managed to work its way upstairs so that our hallway smelled like smoke. I agree with a previous poster about the lack of shelves/drawers to put belongings and clothes. The bathroom was a nice size, but I though the towels were poor quality. The gym is on the 1st floor with adequate equipment. It's rather small and one thing I thought was odd was that there was no bathroom. The room is too small for a bathroom, but I figured there must be one next door. When I asked where the closest bathroom room was, I was told downstairs in the lobby or up in my room. It just seemed strange. My last complaint - the costs of in-room internet access ($13 or $14) and the charge for use of the computer in the lobby, but the kicker was that to print something out there is a $1.05 charge per sheet of paper. $1.05 per sheet of paper???? Please. I recently stayed at a Marriott Courtyard in San Francisco and there was free wifi not only in the lobby but in the hotel rooms. urthermore, I needed to print an important document and they printed out the entire 22 pages for FREE.  I don't want to be totally negative. The location is great if you plan to shop. Also, the concierge and front desk staff were friendly and efficient. I've stayed at several Fairmonts and am usually wowed by my stay. This didn't quite live up to my experiences at other Fairmonts.

<Content>Perfection We stayed at this hotel after having a disastrous experience at another Boston Hotel and being forced to move at 6 in the morning. What a pleasure the Fairmont is! They found us a room at 6am, in fact, stayed on the phone with me until they were sure there was a room ready! The room was beautiful and huge by any standard, the amenities elegant and the service impeccable. We stayed on the club floor for a few dollars more and it was well worth it. From the incredible buffet breakfast (lox, fresh pastries, eggs, yogurt, fruit, homemade oatmeal and more!) to the free wireless and the beautiful lounge, we felt pampered and cared for. The concierge anticipated our every need. The lobby is spectacularly gorgeous, and the location flawless. Ths is a wonderful wonderful hotel, up there with the best 5 stars everywhere!

<Content>Boston Delight I must say that I really couldn't fault the hotel, service or the room. We stayed 5 nights in November and I would recommend staying on the fourth floor (executive floor). It may be more expensive, but if you want extensive continental breakfast each morning, hors-d'oeuvres between 5-7pm, endless take out coffees (saved a fortune!), soft drinks (alcohol is an honour bar system), 3 private lounges, internet access and cookies for bedtime; its all included and worth it. The hotel can become a little busy on the main floors as often there are conferences taking place, which makes having 3 private lounges well worth it for a bit of rr (rest and recovery). The hotel is perfectly located for Back Bay (shopping) and Beacon Hill (historic architecture) and is directly near the entrance to a Shopping Mall (Neiman Marcus, Gucci, Vuitton; et al) if the weather is not on your side. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, but upgrade to the fourth floor, you wont regret it.

<Content>Great! We stayed at the Fairmont for 5 nights in the middle of October. We were upgraded to a Deluxe corner room on the 6th floor. It was a very spacious room with a fake or use to be a fireplace. The beds were great and the room was very quiet.The location of the hotel is probably the best in the city as far as I'm concerned. Major shopping and transportation subway is right at your doorstep.We mainly found restaurants near the hotel that we could walk to. If the weather is bad you would need a taxi...but beware. ... The taxi drivers in Boston drive you completely AROUND everywhere until they get an expensive taxi ride. We were ripped off about 4 times. Especially from the airport and going to the North End for dinner one night.Weather permitting, you can walk to Funeul Hall in about 20 minutes and I would recommend doing so. You see a lot of sights along the way. We also took the subway to Harvard and it was a piece of cake. Harvard was beautiful and we spent several hours just meandering around. Restaurants: Joes American Grill over On Dartmouth Street just a few blocks from the hotel. Very nice place and fairly inexpensive food for lunch or dinner. Smith and Wollensky in the back bay for steak. Beautiful and historic castle. We asked to see where they hang and age the meat...amazing! Great meal! We ate lunch at Stephanie's on Newburys and wasn't very impressed. We had Davide's for Italian in the North End and it was our most expensive dinner...but not worth it. The concierge recommended it. We had dinner at Legal Seafood and that was very good. We walked down to the Funeul Hall for lunch one day and that was fun! Skipjacks for seafood and cocktails. Very lively place......popular..make reservations. They have Miller Drafts for $2.00.....one half block from hotel.The Duck Tours looked fun but we had done a tour our prior visit. I would have liked to take the boat out to Cape Cod one day...just not enough time. 90 minutes to get there. Wanted to go to the JFK museum as well.......subway route....but we planned on going in the afternoon and ran out of time so go in the morning.There is a starbucks right next door to the hotel, but you can get a coffee pot in your room with coffee for your entire stay for $10 total. There is a 7-11 or Rite Aid across the street to buy water and a liqueur store next door to that if you want to buy beer to have in your room.

<Content>Nice above average hotel in Boston.... Had a party at the Fairmont, booked 2 rooms. Unless you get a great deal on the rate, it is expensive for the regular rooms. I have been here before, only stayed in the average rooms. I would like to see if the club floor or suites were outstanding. The rooms tend to be nice, the bathrooms are tiny. There is no coffee machine, and no coffee sold in the lobby, so room service is the only option, or go out to get coffee. The 2 pots of coffee serving 6 people, was 50.00 plus tip. That is a lot for coffee, got a whole breakfast delivered on linen with flowers at the Ritz Boston for less. 40/nite to park, valet never got my luggage out, a few problems but close to T, Pretty location, great resturants around. Liked this hotel better than the Copley Plaza Hotel, but not as nice as the Ritz Boston Common.The lobby is average, nice old bostonian bar, very elegant, but pricey. Nice location on Copley Square. The Door man/ Bellman? was helpful getting a gang to the North End for dinner.

<Content>Heavenly My daughters and I stayed at the Fairmont Oct. 7th, 2006 for 3 nights. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. The beds are to die for. Front desk was very accomodating. Requested to change room from 1st floor because of smoking rooms nearby. I was on the 6th floor the next day and they took care of moving luggage and all. Front desk is wonderful! This hotel is the perfect location to all shopping and subway. When I return, I will stay nowhere but here. My only complaint is the Oak Room. I ordered a Stoli Cosmo and it cost me $17.00. That I will NEVER do again. UGH!

<Content>A lovely night I spent an absolutely lovely night here last week and recommend it highly.I had booked through Priceline, and it was the first time I had ever used their service. I was only staying one night, I was arriving late, and I was willing to take a gamble. Smart gamble it was indeed! The drawbacks were these: I was given the smallest room at the hotel, but it was still extremely comfortable for one and beautifully appointed to boot. There were no views as it faced buildings on both sides, but since I was only staying one night, I didn't care, and it was blissfully quiet. There was no dresser and thus no drawer space (although again, one night, who cares), the bathroom was small (but it was comfortable and had good amenities), and one of the two phones in the room didn't work. On the plus side was absolutely everything else. I arrived just before 11pm. The hotel was still fully staffed, and every single person that dealt with me, down to the room service attendent, was absolutely lovely. The restaurant had closed so I called for room service at 11:30. It arrived in less than 15 minutes, piping hot, and, surprisingly, was actually extremely good. The mini bar was well stocked, and a half bottle of a wonderful red wine that is one of my favorites at home was among the choices. The room was beautiful....almost like a small luxury hotel in Paris. The wireless internet worked perfectly even though the hotel only guaranteed wireless in the lobby. They graciously allowed me a late check out even though I was leaving on a Friday that was the start of a busy holiday weekend.I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat....although I would choose a larger room if I were staying longer than a couple of days or if I were to be more than one person. Let me just reiiterate though that I was in the smallest room the hotel offers (because of my price choice) and that their average double rooms are probably more than comfortable for two. I liked everything about the Fairmont Copley....the location is perfect, the hotel itself is quite beautiful and has a lot of old world charm, and the staff are just terrific. Of the many places I've stayed in Boston, this is so far my favorite.

<Content>Very nice stay I should preface this by noting that we used Rewards Points to pay for our stay, so the only cost to us was the parking.We chose the Fairmont because it was part of our points package and it was within walking distance to the Wang Theatre (about 15-20 minutes). As well, they also welcomed our dog.The valet and doorman were nice and friendly when we drove up. And we were very pleasantly surprised with an upgrade to a king suite when we checked in, so the visit got off to a great start. It was pretty busy in the hotel at the time - looked like there was some sort of seminar or something going on - so it took a while for the few bags we had to make it upstairs.The room was excellent! The bathroom was very spacious - two smaller rooms (toilet/bidet/large shower stall in one and vanity and large tub in the other) - and the rest of the room was very large (spacious enough for the king bed, a couple of bedside tables, the armoire, a couch, a bench at the end of the bed, a coffee table - you get the picture). I did check out the fitness center - it was small, but seemed to have the basics - 2 or 3 treadmills, a couple of eliptical machines, a good stack of weights, as well as a universal. The equipment looked pretty new. It appeared to be very clean and well-maintained - just as the rest of the hotel appears to be.We were in and out of the hotel and the staff was always very friendly/helpful the few times we had questions. Our only complaint was that the shower stall ended up leaking water profusely on the floor - I felt bad about it and we cleaned it up as best we could and left the towels in the tub.According to our bill, the hotel would have cost $260/night, which considering it's a four star, nicely located, and the room was actually a suite, probably isn't too bad. (We'll be staying at the Onyx soon, which will cost us more.) Money permitting, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!

<Content>Give me a brand new Marriott instead Fantastic lobby and downhill from there. This is one of those hotels that charges you every chance they get. Another reviewer cited the $7 bottle of water. What he forgot to mention is that it really is $7+tax+a 10% restocking fee. I travel a lot on business and have never heard of a restocking fee.Cha-ching.You want a coffee pot in your room? You know, like Courtyard's routinley supply. Well that coffee pot's gonna cost you $10 per night. Cha-ching.How about hi-speed internet service? $13.95. Cha-ching.And after all those charges, all you ahve is a small room in a tired old hotel.Give me a new Marriott any day.

<Content>short business trip - absolutely beautiful hotel! Stayed here for one night on business the week of 10/2. The attention to detail of this hotel is one of the best I've ever seen. Room was clean and comfortable and the food was great. Couldn't have been a better stay.

<Content>Nice Lobby, Tiny Rooms! The service at the hotel is first rate, location is superb. But if you are a businessman or family looking for comfort and space.... this is not for you.The lobby is massive, lush, and well appointed. This image begins to deteriorate when one walks into the cramped elevator, and dips further as musty odours waft you towards your tiny room. I'm sure you can pay for a sitting room and all, but I didn't and the room is so small that you almost have to squeeze by the foot of you bed to get to the bathroom. If you want to watch TV, there is no 'sitting room' style chair even. You either sit on edge of your bed, or lay down and watch it at an angle. Like most 'old lady' hotels (with apologies to any elderly women), the money has been spent in the lobby for those touring it's historical significance vice business style amenities for those staying there. A final kicker - 7$ for a bottle of water in the room - come on!.As with many who travel constantly, please.... book me at the Courtyard Marriot or equivalent next time! Likely cheaper for the company, and more practical!

<Content>Superb Superb hotel in a superb location! We had a beautiful room with its own sitting room. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we were treated so well. The concierge and bell boys were unbelievably helpful. The icing on the cake is Catie Copley, the hotel's very own Canine Ambassador (complete with her own business card!). She is absolutely gorgeous and it was a treat to take her to the common for a walk. To sum up, an elegant and stylish hotel with superb customer service. I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else if I went back to Boston.

<Content>Great Stay @ The Plaza We started our tour of New England with a 2 nights stay at the Plaza. When we arrived the staff were very obliging and made us feel welcome.A deluxe room on the third floor was beautifully appointed with quality furnishings and superb beds. Bathroom was also nice, if a little on the small side. Some traffic noise could be heard but this wasn't too much of a distraction.The hotel is ideally located near Newbury and Boylston streets, and the Prudential Centre for great shopping. A Starbucks Coffee is just around the corner for breakfast!Would definitely stay there again!!!

<Content>Perfect on the Gold Level My husband and I stayed 5 nights at this hotel to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary. We booked a room on the Gold Level. When we checked in we were told we had been upgraded to a signature room. The room was very large and overlooked the square. We were personally shown to our room and on the table was a bottle of champagne and fruit and flowers which we thought was a lovely touch. Being on the gold floor gave us access to all the lounges which were beautifully decorated. Breakfast was complimentary and so were soft drinks, tea and coffe all day. In the evening there were tasty snacks put out. Some of the days we ate so much we did not need any dinner! There are only about 56 rooms on the gold floor and this gives you the idea that this is a hotel within a hotel. The lounges were very relaxing to come back to after a day of sightseeing. I must say that if you did not stay on the gold level there are no lounges in the main part of the hotel. Although there is a very nice bar and restaurant which we tried. If we went back to Boston we would stay there again, but only on the gold level. If anyone wants any more info let me know. My email is ruthlfraser@hotmail.com

<Content>Every moment was Fantastic!!!!! We recently spent 1 week at the Copley with my 3 children all under the age of 7. We were in Boston celebrating my Fahter-in-laws 70th birthday, we celebrated in the Oak Room at the hotel. The Copley staff went above and beyond. Every staff member we interacted with from making the arrangements, to the door man, to the waiter who served our party were courteous and efficient. The food the evening of the party in the Oak Room was outstanding. The rooms were spotless and spacious. The location is the best in boston, walking distance to tons of activities and a 30 second walk to the T subway. This hotel is well worth the trip to Boston!!!!

<Content>Beautiful hotel We stayed at the Fairmont for 5 nights with our 4 children. We had connecting rooms. One was a King and the other 2 Queens. Beautiful lobby. Our rooms were at the end of the hall. Very queit. The bathrooms were updated, our rooms were very large. The kids room had a fireplace. The minibar is very expensive as you would expect. No problem because there's a 7-11 and CVS right down the street. Stop there on your way back to the hotel. We booked thru the hotel and asked for the Summer rate. I had to ask several times for the special rate. They first quoted me 429/night. We ended at 269. Still expensive but much better. Very well located, close to the T, we even walked to Fenway. Staff was helpful. I would stay here again.

<Content>Not worth the Price This hotel tries its best to be top rate, but its hard to justify your stay in the tiny room (called Moderate Room), and the average food. If you love old hotels that have been fairly well renovated you'll like it. One annoying thing is the mice. We saw one zipping along the floor in the restaurant at breakfast. Colleagues mentioned that the had one in their room before which would be considerably less entertaining than our single mouse sighting.There are other nice hotels in the area so you definitely have choices. There is a Hilton which was recommended to us.I'd say you could do better for your price than this place.Be sure to go to the Petit Robert Bistro if you stay in this area which was one great highlight to our trip.

<Content>a fantastic hotel in a top location We just returned from a one night stay at the Fairmont Copley Plaza which included my two young children. I was initially concerned about this hotel being a good family hotel, but that ended up to not be any problem. The house dog Caty Coply makes most kids feel right at home. This hotel is gorgeous and easily accomodates families. We were upgraded to a room that included two double beds (extremely comfortable by the way) with a fantasic city view. I have no complaints about this hotel in any way; cleanliness, service, location (outstanding), amenities.. all was top notch.

<Content>Disappointing service for a 4-star hotel The room we were given, and the service we got, were not up to my expectations. I stay at 4- and 5-star hotels about 10 nights of the year, and am a member of the Fairmont President's Club preferred guest program. Every interaction we had with a staff member was unimpressive, from the mumbling check-in person to the distracted check-out clerk. No doorman was on duty when we checked in, nobody offered to help with our bags, and the concierge was unable to answer basic questions about the immediate Copley area.The door to our Fairmont Room opened right onto the bed, with no vestibule or closet area to separate the room from the public hallway. The closet provided less than 12 inches of hanging space, and no trouser hangers at all. There were no drawers or shelves for clothing, anywhere in the room -- the whole armoire was taken up by the TV and minibar. There was no coffee in the room, although a notice in the minibar area said that we could have a pot and supplies delivered for an additional cost! The bathroom was minimal, with a shower over the tub surrounded by a fabric shower curtain (which, of course, blows in on you as you're trying to relax) and no robes. Toiletry amenities were basic but decent, and actually smelled pleasantly of citrus and herbs. But still, for a 4-star hotel, I expected a better setup.The TV in our room was malfunctioning, turning itself on at will. We tried to unplug it, but the armoire was too heavy to move. We turned down the volume, closed the doors, and threw the bedspread over the armoire to hide the light that was coming throught the door. The next morning, we asked the front desk to have it fixed. Maintenence left a note saying that the problem was resolved, but it wasn't -- we were awakened at 2am by the TV turning itself on at full volume! Needless to say, we weren't very happy the next morning.We left for our day out at about 8am, and left the please make up room sign on the door. When we returned, exhausted and ready for a shower, at 3:30pm, the room was still just as we left it. We called housekeeping, and the person who answered actually lectured us that we should KNOW that they have until 4pm to make up the room. (Are we psychic?) We asked them to send up towels so that we could shower; 30 minutes later, they hadn't arrived, so we called again. 20 minutes later, still no towels. I went out into the hall, found the abandoned maid's cart, and got them myself.The maid finally came to our door a few minutes later at 5pm, asking to make up the room. We told her that we'd like her to come back in an hour or so, after we left for dinner, and she sighed and stamped off. We took our shower, and came out to find a little sorry you didn't want your room made up notice slid under the door -- infuriating! When we called the front desk and explained what had happened, and asked them to please send someone up in 30 minutes to freshen the room, they gave us all kinds of flack, and finally agreed to only change the sheets and towels.The location on Compley Square is fabulous, and the bed was comfortable -- but those are just about the only things I can think of to recommend this hotel. I'd rather spend less and stay at the Marriott across the street; at least then I'd expect minimal service.

<Content>Noisy and needs updated Arrived at Hotel after having a terrific stay at the Fairmont in Washington DC, from the outside, thought, yes this looks promising, although once inside it is a different story. Yes the foyer is very grand, but the rooms are a different matter. Upon checking in we asked for a quite room, with a view, and when we explained that we had just come from the Fairmont in Washington they very kindly upgraded us to the 4th floor (GOLD FLOOR) - we thought great.!! When we were shown to our room we were shocked to find a REALLY REALLY small room, a bathroom which needs updated and a droan from the air-conditioning vents just below our room, as for the view it was the side of the building next door!! We were not happy and immediately asked to be re-located, only to be told the hotel was fully booked and they could not do anything until the morning. So a sleepness night was had.Give them their dues they moved us in the morning, to a room which was a good bit bigger, not huge - but the noise was just the same.- it really is loud. We were told that was part of living in a city.Given that we have stayed in a couple of Fairmont Hotels around the world - I would not put this hotel in the same league - needs updated and more attention paid to detail.The only good thing to come out of our stay was that on the fourth floor you have access to a lounge with complimentary breakfast, drinks anytime etc.

<Content>Repeat performance Have stayed here about 10 times in the past two years and feel like I know the place well. I would agree that certain house keeping issues are a concern at the Fairmont. When I arrived on this last trip, I found an old dust mop right in the hallway off the elevators (one of those yellow feathered things) and on my first day there, maid service did not show up until about 3:00. In addition, on my final morning, I had just stepped out of the shower and into a robe at 8:30 a.m. when there was an abrupt knock on the door. Before I had a chance to say anything (I was all wet and listeneing to the Today Show while drinking my coffee), a woman unlocked the door and walked into my room. I was so shocked and surprised I could barely react as this has NEVER happened before. She was in a uniform but there was no cleaning cart with her- I do not know who she was but it was totally uncalled for. I would recommend bolting the door. I had just gotten room service for breakfast and had not thought to do so. It was strange. And room service trays are left in the hallway for WAY too long. Aside from that, things were fine. Catie Copley is now a huge celebrity and the kids all love her. It is sweet to see so many little ones running up to her. She makes the formaility of this place all more cozy in a way. Yes, the bathroom is a bit outdated and sometimes the sound level is poor, but something about the Fairmont keeps me coming back for more. It has amazing charisma and charm, and of course,the location is tops.

<Content>For $84, I shouldn't complain...but MICE! Let me start by saying I know I should not complain about staying at this hotel for $84 a night, as I found them through Priceline (I never thought a hotel of this caliber would be on that site!) but soemthings just aren't right, even at that price. When I arrived, there was no one to greet me and I struggled with my bags to the desk. I asked for an upgrade (and I was a little upset about having to lug my bags) and they put me on the Gold Floor...what a treat and it made me immediately forget about my poor reception! The room was ok, but the lounge and the service in the lounge was great, as well as the food. Would I spend $300+ a night to be on the Concierge Floor, the normal rate,...no chance, would rather stay at the Ritz or Four Season. It was nice, but definately not great. But for $84 a night...it was a treat! The bathrooms was very small and not very clean...the hotel is just old and in need of a renovation/TLC as no one seems to care about dirty corridors, little tears and chips all over, chipped bath tub and peeling wallpaper. Nothing terrible, just not crisp as you would expect on a Concierge floor or at the Ritz/Four Seasons. But, the biggest issue was that I saw a mouse in the Oak Bar and also saw a mouse in my room! It was awful! I travel very frequently to city hotels and have never seen one in a hotel before! This would lead me to believe that they have cleanliness issues throughout the hotel and there were room service trays that stayed in the corridor for quite some time. I guess Mickey runs around looking for those leftovers. When I saw the rodent in the bar, I mentioned it to the waitress who basically shrugged her shoulders and said it is part of being in a big city...so I guess they had these complaints before. Would I go back? NO! Not with MICE! But if there were no mice and priced at $175 - $200 a night, I would consider it! I have heard great things about Jury's, right around the corner and will try that next time!

<Content>Nice but I've had better Our stay in Boston was not helped by rain, rain and more rain. My fiance had a conference at the hotel which was the purpose of our stay. We found the rooms to be of good quality although the bathrooms were a bit dated (tiles falling off in some places). The bed was nice and comfy, and the room was large. The maid service was so-so. One day, they didn't come till 3pm so we said don't worry (just give us the towels). No other hotel can beat its location though. It is directly across the road from a large shopping mall.

<Content>Fabulous hotel We stayed here for 4 nights in May and enjoyed every minute of it! The hotel is grand and the staff are most helpful. The check-in was a breeze and Jason (who checked us in) gave us a map and marked out all the various tourist spots and walks for us (even without asking!) Have not got service like that in other 5 star hotels we have stayed at around the world.The room was beautiful and had a separate lounge/sitting area - almost like a one bedroom apartment. The bathroom was well appointed with beautiful toiletries as one would expect from Fairmont chain. We were Fairmont Presidents members so had complimentary broadband internet.The hotel is close to everything - easy walk to Park Plaza, Boston Common, Symphony Hall, shopping centers and is in the middle of two metro stops. Highly recommended.

<Content>You have to stay at this hotel! We just returned from a long weekend at the Fairmont Copley and I could not be more relaxed! We stayed on the Gold level floor (4th floor), which I highly recommend. This floor receives amazing catering- deluxe breakfast, a stocked kitchen with water and soft drinks that are out all day, your own concierge and evening appetizers- all included in the room price. We also loved Jim Carey- he is the main conceige over the entire hotel and really knows Boston and helped make everything happen! He got us tickets to the Red Sox game- 5th row behind 1st base! Also, we loved Catie the Ambassador- very sweet and obedient. The Oak room is a must as well- amazing food and wine! You have to stay here if you are going to Boston- it feels local and authenic, while surrounding you in the lap of luxury!

We had drinks and appetizers at the Oak Room....we think its the best upscale bar in Boston..the service was awesome and the food and drinks were fabulous...we could have stayed there all night !Everyone was so nice...including that cute little dog in the lobby...her name is Katie Copley I believe ?I would stay here again anyday anytime...we hated to leave ! We booked the room on priceline and paid $129 for the night...What a steal !Love love love this place !

Standard rates were $209 a night that weekend. Booking through Priceline did not compromise the quality or the service. It was a beautiful room and the hotel has a lot of charm. The green line T stop was a block away and a shopping mall is across the street. A 24 hr CVS is located next to the T stop for late night snacks. It was the perfect stay. The location was unbeatable and I can go on and on about the price! Book here without reservation.

<Content>Great stay in Boston! A beautiful hotel in the heart of Boston! The location is great--perfect for exploring Boston. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They are a very busy staff but always had time to answer questions and take care of us.Our three year old granddaughter was with us and immediately fell in love with Catey, the hotel's very mellow black lab. We signed up to take her for a walk--or so we thought--Catey has her own agenda and route and introduced us to all her friends (human and dog) along the way. A hilarious experience!We only hope we get to experience the Fairmont Copley again soon.

<Content>perfect but pricey The Fairmont is a very elegant and impressive hotel. Every memeber of staff was always friendly and attentive. I had a lovely deluxe room with huge bathroom. The location was brilliant and the city is very easy to walk around. Only reason why I didnt give 5* is the price of the extras i.e water in my room $6!

<Content>AMAZING STAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I stayed at the Fairmont recently with a group of 12. It was my daughter's birthday and she ONLY wanted to stay at the Fairmont. (of course I brought along 3 of my adult friends!!!) We had an AMAZING experience from check-in, to dealing with Pascal at the concierge desk who drove the girls to a local restaurant on Newbury Street in the hotel's London cab, to the excellent accomodations, service etc....The staff, rooms, food and service make this hotel my pick any day of the week!!!!!!! You can BET we will be back!!!!!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Stayed for three nights during March, and service was excellent for the most part. Alex at the front desk was not very helpful and quite cold. However, the rest of the staff was superb. We got a corner deluxe room, which was quite spacious with classic New England decor. We took a look at the fairmont room, and it was really small. The hotel is beautiful in the old world tradition, similar to the Waldorf in New York. You really feel like you are staying in a part of history. The gym is the size of a small room/closet with very few equipment. There is a Boston Sports Club across the square. The location of the hotel can't be beat. The Copley T stop is central to everything. Newbury St. is a hop away, and plenty of inexpensive to expensive restaurants within walking distance. The neighborhood is safe and charming. Overall, an excellent hotel and would stay again.

<Content>Mouse in the house! I was at the Fairmont Copley for a large conference this week-after staying at the Fairmont Hamilton Princess and having an awful experience I thought I would try again..one last time. I was promised by the reservation agent that I would have a wonderful stay at the Fairmont Copley. Well....reservations agents should not make promises. I have stayed there for four nights and have the following comments. I stayed in a duluxe double with a view of Copley Square. The only window in the very large room looked out over Copley was so small I could only see the Square when I was in the bed closest to that little window and leaned out to see. There was also a very large brown stain on the floor by a bed that had not been removed. They did just do a large renovation but the paint had already started to come off the ceiling above the shower curtain (that wouldn't fit around the whole shower ...brrrr) there are cracks in the paint around the crown moldings and the insides of the closet was old and tarnished from the wooden hangers hitting the wall a clothes were taken off.1. Service: My resfreshment basket was totally empty for two days. On the third day the stocker came into my room while I was working on my laptop without knocking on the door and breezed into restock. At check out I noticed I had been charged very high amounts for the refreshment center though I had not used it (since there had been nothing in it). So either one of their employees is taking things and charging it to the customer, or the last customer who was there took everything from it when they left and then by the time the stocker came in to count what was missing a new customer (me) had been there for three days and was therefore charged! In some hotels I have seen a weighted system where as soon as someone grabs something from the basket or scale it will be changed to your room if not replaced within 60 seconds. (Wynn Hotel, Las Vegas)2. On the last two nights of my stay a little mouse came right under my door (there is a two inch gap that allows hallway light or mice to get in) I called the front desk who seemed quite surprised and then a maintenence person decided to mosey on up a half and hour later. He then returned with traps with peanut butter and placed them next to my shoes in the closet and under the safe. So the mouse came back the next night to pay me a visit and didn't seem to pay the traps much bother. 3. Katie Copley the resident Black Lab does have a bit of an attitude (as reported in another one of your member surveys) and didn't really seem to care that I was trying to pet her. She just looked away. 4. Working in your room. I had a lot of work to be done which I thought could be done in the privacy of my room-yet during the day there seemed to be staff member after staff member coming in and out of the room (some not even knocking) like it was grand central. It was a very noisy environment to work in. The doors do not have spring hinges to keep the heavy OLD doors from slamming behind people as they come and go and the staff seem not to care about letting their customers sleep at night when noisy radios are blasting with security and housekeeping/staff are yelling back and forth to eachother in the hall while cleaning. 5. Compensation- I did complain about the mouse and the issue of the refreshment bar not being stocked, and me still getting charged for the whole basket and I was told that I would not be charged for the refreshment baskets, and would be given a nights stay and my phone calls would be taken off my bill. I felt this was nice. She also said that she would put me on preseidents level (which I think is open to all) so that was helpful and she was very pleasant.6. As I have read comments from customer reviews and have stayed in now two Fairmonts (Hamilton Bermuda and Boston Copley and about to stay at the Queen Elizabeth in Montreal-but the reviews are awful) I am unsure as to whether or not I would be staying in a Fairmont again. There seems to be a constant problem with staff, customer service, cleanliness all for the amount of money people have to pay to be a part of a large and historic hotel company. The legacy aspect of this company seems to be lost in the big business of what seems to play a larger role in the Fairmont Legacy at this point. As big business becomes more and more important these days the historical legacy of an iconic hotel industry will soon be lost and it is the customers and the old hotels that are being forgotten.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Excellent Location - Recommended This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in. The rooms are large and beautiful, very clean. This is a great location in the city, walking distance to shopping and many great restaurants and only one block from the subway. Choose your room carefully - the rooms facing the interior courtyard overlook a rooftop and airconditioning, and have very little sunlight. The rooms facing the street are large, bright and beautiful. Staff is helpful and kind. The lounge offers some of the best drinks and jazz music. I recommend this hotel for vacationers and business travelers. EXCELLENT hotel!

<Content>The staff and management of this hotel are the best in Boston by far!! This is a four or five diamond property in the heart of Boston. The views are not the best, but you are in Boston for goodness sakes. Are you gonna want to stare out of your room the whole time? The staff met my every need immediately upon request. Upon entering you feel transformed into the Renaissance that is Back Bay in Boston. Fairmont never dissapoints and this is no exception.

<Content>Great Hotel - Highly Recommended We just returned from a most enjoyable 3 night stay at this plush hotel. The location is superb - in the fashionable Back Bay district of Boston, just off of Newbury Street which has numerous upscale shops and restaurants. The hotel is a 10 minute walk From Bostom Common and The Public Gardens, and 15-20 minutes from Beacon Hill.Common areas are very lavish and elegant. Rooms are extremely large - request a signature room with a view of Copley Plaza. Our room was atleast 50% larger than typical hotel rooms. Very beautifully furnished and very quiet.Hotel staff is outstanding in every respect. Very accomodating and helpful. Superb service at every turn.

<Content>Perfect Hotel in Downtown Boston We just returned from a five night stay at the Fairmont Copley. The location of the hotel is excellent- dining, shopping at sight seeing are all within easy walking distance or a quick ride on the T. Our room was clean,and spacious; bathroom was elegant. Overall our stay was very relaxing and enjoyable.We lived in Boston for five years and moved away a few months ago and this was our first time back. I had read various reviews and at the time the Fairmont had the least negative comments,that and it's ideal location prompted me to then find the best rate. I found a very reasonable rate on the hotel's website, although I had to prepay. Upon arrival I was informed that I was upgraded to a deluxe room :)Upon departure if you valet your car I would allow 15-20 min or so for them to retrieve it. In addition, when checking out the there may be a slight delay if many people are checking out at the same time so plan according. Call the bell captain 15-20 min (just to be on the safe side) before you leave if you need help with your luggage.If you are concerned about outside noise, I would recommend an interior room. It was so quiet- you wouldn't guess you were staying in downtown Boston. The rooms that face the street are on the T line, and there is quite a bit a traffic that passses buy so it tends to be a little loud. Just a comment on a previous review-The Oak Bar at the Fairmont is very popular so reservations would be a good idea. Also it is quite fancy so proper dress is suggested. eg. no jeansThe location is great- CVS is right across the street, Starbucks and the Copley T stop (subway) is less than a block away.Here are a few of my favorite places if you need suggestions on places to go while you are in Boston.Fanueil Hall Houston's Naked FishNorth End Mike's Pastry Modern Pastry (ricotta canoli- yum!!) Brunch with Outdoor Seating (for summer) Joes American Cafe The Living RoomCopley/Downtown Top of the Hub at the Prudential Building (just for drinks- and a fabulous view of Boston, dinner is ok and a little overpriced) Atlantic Fish Company  Stephanie's on Newbury Whiskey Park (at the Park Plaza Hotel) Finale's (for dessert- try the creme brulee or the molten chocolate cake, also at the Park Plaza Hotel)Hope you enjoy your stay at the Fairmont- we're definitely staying there when we return to Boston.

<Content>Grand Dame or Old Bag? As a Fairmont President's Club Premier Member, we were upgraded to a 950 square feet Park Suite. Space is nice, but age of the hotel showed. Dings, dents and the only internet access was at the desk in the bedroom with none in the living room meaning that I would awaken my wife early in the morning to get any work done. Bathroom has no forced air heat or a/c outlet and, with 20 degree weather outside, it was pretty darned cold. Housekeeping great, however, and empty fridge in pantry was nice. Service personnel, other than the Oak rooms (see below), are outstanding, but the resident Labrador Retriever, Catie, has a bit of an attitude (strange for a Lab!)The Oak Room and Oak Bar are another story. Waiting 15 to 20 minutes for a drink in the Oak Bar most nights was such a hassle that we bypassed it. Dinner in the Oak Room was ok, but not spectacular and the table was too small for all the plates. Gave up on breakfast Sunday morning as it took 10 minutes for someone to take our names and to inform us of at least a 20 minute wait. Decamped to the Westin Copley Place and were seated at once.Monday morning breakfast was outstanding in quality, but non-existant in service. Muslim Steve Martin in a busboy named Mohammed, who informed us 10 minutes later, that he forgot our request for cream and did not replace the cold coffee with hot. Waiter was slower than molasses in January and about as enthusiastic as a dead fish.Bottom line is that if you want a Grand Dame with a long history and a name, go over to the northwest corner of Arlington and Newbury Street and check into the renovated and refreshed Ritz-Carlton where you can have a heated bathroom, a drink on demand and breakfast that can be served in under two hours. The Fairmont (former C.P. Hotels) properties in Canada are better managed than most of them in the U.S. Chicago being the outstanding exception. No more, no way, never again and sorry to say it.

<Content>A wonderful weekend at Fairmont Copley Plaza We enjoyed every moment at the Copley Plaza where we celebrated our 3rd wedding anniversary. Everyone of the staff was helpful, friendly, courteous and professional..the valet parker, the doorman, the guest registrar, the bellhop, the room service waiter and the concierge. The bedroom and bathroom were recently renovated and very elegant. The bathroom had both a beautiful tub and a separateglass/tile shower.  Previous reviewers have stated that the mini-bar is expensive as is the room-service breakfast. It's true, but the charges are the norm for any hotel in this class and price range. You can simply choose not to use them.  The quality of every aspect of the hotel and the professionalism of all the staffwill keep us coming back in the future and we would recommend it to anyone without any hesitation or qualifications at all.

<Content>Great place to spend a few days!! Just returned from spending three glorious days at the Copley Plaza and were impressed from the moment we arrived and entered the extremely grand lobby area. We were part of a group of 40 travellers and others in the group complained that the rooms were small but we had no complaints, with a spotless and very spacious corner room with two queen beds. The bathroom was marble and again with all the mod cons. Try to get down to breakfast early as the Oak Room isnt particularly large. Service can be fairly laid back and the waiters dont seem to cope so well when things start getting busy.No other complaints and we found it the perfect luxury base for a city break. Its also ideally located for all the shopping malls and attractions that Boston has to offer.

<Content>Wow!!! WOW!!! My daughter and I spent the weekend at the Fairmount Copley Plaza on the President's Club Floor. WOW!!! This hotel has so much class and grace. The bed was the most comfortable ever, including my own at home. Our room, basically a standard room, was huge, which is nonexistent in the newer chain hotels. The bathroom had been refurbished with beautiful black marble and had every toiletry provided, top of the line. We had a beautiful view of Copley Park from both the bedroom and the bathroom. The hotel is conveniently located adjacent to a lot of shopping and restaurants, but being on the club floor with the snacks and beverages, we only ended up eating out twice. The staff is usually what give a hotel it's character and the staff here is first class all the way. Treat yourself and plan a visit!

<Content>What a disappointment... Well, I certainly had high hopes when I saw the lobby of the hotel - it was absolutely stunning upon arrival. Unfortunately the lobby (and the hotel's location) were the only things I can rave about.For $475 night, I expected a clean, non-smoking room....nothing extravagent, considering the Boston prices are so high...what I found upon arrival was pet hair on the chair / bed, and smoke wafting in through the vents of my room. The bathroom was exceptionally small (to the point where you couldn't really have any items on the sink, and it's tiny size could truly only accomodate one person). The shower was old and moldy...tile cracked in the bathroom...clearly not my idea of a recent renovation. I'd comment on the view, but there was none.After a call to the front desk, we were upgraded to the Club-level which meant a slightly larger bathroom, and a larger room. As the bell-man let us into the room, we discovered 8 pillows lying in the middle of the room. Was there a party going on prior to our arrival? The room was very dusty, and clearly hadn't been used in a while. There was still smoke drifting in through the vents, but not as bad.The Club level breakfast is quite lame...a few muffins and bagels and fruit. Honestly, the setting was nice, but the food was not noteworthy.Upon leaving I was told I couldn't have a receipt for my room (as it was paid for on my Corporate Expedia account). I have never had that experience before - they are always more than happy to print off a receipt for me. Now that I am home, I just recently opened my Visa bill, and gues what - another separate charge of $385 in addition to my Expedia bill. I am curious to see how long it will take them to straighten that out.Perhaps my visit was just a fluke, but be warned that the hotel is old, old, old, the rooms are not charming and have no view, and the bathrooms are the worst I've ever stayed in...if you must be in this part of Boston, do yourself a favor and stay at the Westin. It's by no means extravagant, but it's better than the Fairmont.

<Content>The dame did not disappoint Last hotel of our holiday and what a treat. Despite manic Boston traffic and no available kerbside parking, the valet immediately took our car away, relieving us of a potential headache. We are labrador people and after nearly two weeks, were missing our pair, so my wife was delighted to be greeted by Katie the black lab at the entrance!Check in was excellent - fast and courteous. It has to be said that the staff of this hotel are maybe the greatest feature. We had booked a room upgrade, so were on the third floor overlooking the busy Dartmouth St. Being relatively high up meant that we were not disturbed by traffic noise, though - Boston drivers please note, your car will move without the horn sounding!What did disturb us though was the unasked for wake up call and the lack of apology for the mistake. Also, we were apparently below the hard floored club room, so noticed some heavy footsteps. Both complaints were well handled by the front of house management and, whilst a new room was offered, we didn't want to move.The room itself was very large and had comfortable seating, so beautiful for relaxing in after a long day walking the streets of Boston. The bed was vast and very soft - luxury. Again, the upgrade was worth it. The bathroom was a bit pokey and had no shelf space - strange in a luxury hotel.We didn't eat dinner in the hotel, but did enjoy their breakfasts. As with any hotel of this standard, not cheap, but served with exactly the right degree of formality. It was a real pleasure to walk in and savour the experience each morning.All in all then, a fantastic hotel and well worth another visit in the future.

<Content>Excellent Stay The Fairmont Copley Plaza definitely doesn't disappoint. The service at this hotel was phenomenal. The rooms, while a touch on the small side, were very comfortable. The food in the Oak Room for dinner was excellent and the breakfast was very good, yet quite expensive. On day 2 we went to the Burger King across the square for breakfast. This hotel has a prime location, as you are a block from 2 different T stops for public transportation and within walking distance to Boston Common and Fenway Park.

<Content>great location and decor, but... I must say I was really impressed when I stepped into the hotel. I felt like I was in a European Chateau, with all the chandeliers and marble. Unfortunately, my feeling changed once I got to my room. The room is very small, so small the TV has to be put on the side wall (making it very difficult to watch), and closet only fits a few items. And the noise level is unbearable. I could hear the door slams and ice machine (although my room was a good 70 feet from it), not to mention the conversation of my neighbors. In addition, the phone was not connected even 1 hour after I checked in (I had to call reception to have it fixed) and the pay movie channel was not working the whole time I was there (2 nights). Overall, as beautiful as the hotel is, I would not go back again unless the paper-thin wall is fixed.

<Content>Fairmont Friendly and Fantastic The Fairmont staff is truly one of the best around, from checking in to odd requets, they meet them with a smile. The new addition of the hotel dog doesn't hurt either, Katie is available for walks, jogs or just to snuggle. Drinks in the Oak Room is the perfect way to end a fine meal in the neighborhood. The drink list is fantastic with some funky creations such as The Blond Bombshell and the POPs martini.The rooms are spacious and impeccable. With views of the park, there is no better way to stay in Boston and experience the old world charm.

<Content>Slam!!!!!!!! Everything was very nice except for the fact that the doors to the rooms slam VERY LOUDLY. If you are a light sleeper forget it once the maids get going in the morning.This place may also be a bit overpriced. Be careful.

<Content>Before you order a pot of coffee.... We had a great time at the Copley---a little too good a time---when our bill came--we had been charged over 200 dollars ----that was just the bill for the incidentals!!! There must have been a lot of hidden charges. Keep in mind we were only there about 10 hours for a one night's stay!!!Next time I order a pot of coffee I will read the small print.

<Content>Not that great I was exicted to stay at this hotel because I heard it had been featured in some big Hollywood film scene. The lobby is very nice and the bar has atmosphere. We were assigned a smaller room due to a special rate from the UK, but when the concierge opened the door of the room it was already occupied. He was embarrassed and upgraded us to a deluxe room which was very nice. The small room was awful, the deluxe room was pretty nice and my special rate was not that cheap! The feeling in the hotel is not cosy or welcoming. We went to the hotel shop to buy a paper and the very rude American Chinese assistant accused my small son of messing up her shop which was not true. I told her off for being so ungracious. The breakfast room was also poorly staffed, we were served by a middle eastern looking waitor who seemed to have big chip on his shoulder, he was downright unfriendly and we waited ages for pancakes - my son's treat in the USA. In the end I walked out and had breakfast in another hotel. I would not stay here again due to the strange atmosphere, bad staff and impersonal feeling. A disappointment.

<Content>Pretty fancy We got an excellent rate here through a last-minute package on Northwest Airlines. I probably would not have been willing to pay the rack rate at this hotel, but if you can get a deal it is definitely worth it.Pros:1. LOCATION was fantastic. Right across the street from Copley Place (shopping mall), Trinity Church, and Boston Library. About a block or two from Newberry Street and Boylston Street, where you can find great shopping and restaurants. Also a T stop was a block away, literally a 3-minute walk.2. HOTEL staff was very friendly, lobby was beautiful, rooms were clean and nicely decorated.Cons:1. AGE of the hotel was a con for me, although I'm sure a lot of people would find it charming. It is very nicely kept up, however the Fairmont rooms are small (reminded me of European hotel rooms) and there were some things, like a fan in the bathroom, that I missed. Also our view was non-existent, although I'm sure there are rooms with really nice views. Also, I find feather pillows extremely uncomfortable, but I know others love them, so it's a matter of taste. 2. One thing that happened to us- upon turning down the bed our first night to sleep, I found this strange stuff on the inside of the sheet. I looked like dark cracks, but when I looked closer, it seemed like little clumps of hair. I called the front desk and even though it was late, they sent someone right up to change the sheets. The guy who came up said that was from ironing. I didn't really buy that, but I really didn't know, so I let it go. The important thing was that they tended to my problem immediately without question.

<Content>Great Locations for the 4th of July Found a great rate and enjoyed our stay due to the location, but was quite suprised at the work that was needed on this hotel. I have stayed at other Fairmont properties and this one isn't at the same level. Don't get me wrong it isn't a holiday inn, but if I hadn't found such a good rate at this hotel and had paid $350 a night I would have been extremely disappointed. The rooms were nicely appointed but the hallways were dank and smelled of mildew. The public areas are nice but some need work. The biggest advantage was its proximity to the festivities during the 4th of July. I will stay here again if I can find a decent rate.

<Content>One of the nicest rooms I have stayed in for quite some time... I planned an impromptu trip into Boston to spend time with my daughter. I booked the room two days ahead of time on Priceline - this gives one access to the Fairmont Room category (king or queen bed / smaller rooms).When we checked in I asked for a room with 2 double beds and was accomodated - the double bedded rooms are in the Deluxe category which affords a more spacious room.I have to say that the hotel looked fantastic from the time we entered, the lobby, the elevators, the hallways, and in particular our room and bathroom. Our room was huge. It was a corner room at the back of the hotel (not on the Westin side of the hotel - on the opposite side which is next to a side street and the Prudential tower), it was at the end of the hallway, not near a stairwell, and was very quiet. (Room number was 301 in case that is helpful to anyone).This room had windows on two sides, two very comfortable double beds with very nice linens and pillows. The room and bathroom were spotless. There was a beautiful fireplace and mantle, a desk, a comfortable club chair and the entertainment center which housed the TV and minibar. The bathroom was enormous - probably about 12 feet by 10 feet. It was a large tub, sink with granite counter, toilet, 2 bathrobes, all marble.... very updated, large and nicely appointed.The ceilings were tall, the moldings so beautiful, the fireplace, chandelier... it was just so elegant and nicely done.As for the people we interacted with they were all very nice and helpful, except for one of the check in clerks who was not going to give us the two double beds. Luckily the room wasn't ready and when we came back she wasn't there and someone with a more generous nature was and accomodated our request. The valet parking attendent was extremely helpful, even took pictures of me and my daughter in front of the hotel.All in all just a fantastic trip. I highly recommend this hotel, particularly for families as the location is very central to many things you might want to do.By the way, I did have a chance to peek in at the queen bedded Fairmont room. While it is also lovely, it was tiny and not as nice a location on the floor as the one we ended up with.

<Content>Fairmont --- Great Location Stayed at the Fairmont for four nights from 18.7.2005. Found Hotel to be in a great location.Close to the shopping at the Prudential Centre and Copley Mall. Short walk to T for visits further afield.On arrival thought the Hotel entrance to be very grand although not many places to sit in lobby. The hotel dog  Catie Copley is a nice touch. Check in very good. Had a deluxe room on first floor overlooking the Westin. We were quite suprised at the lack of noise from outside. Found room to be large and the kingsize bed very comfortable. Found there was only a small cupboard for hanging clothes but lots of drawer space. Bathroom very small with no where to store toiletries. I was under impression rooms had been renovated but maybe they missed ours. sink basin and toilet pedestal both cracked. The biggest disappointment was housekeeping,room not cleaned very well on all the days we were there.Found the the food in Oak Restuarant to be very good although very expensive and the Oak Bar is a nice setting for evening drinks.All the staff we dealt with were very nice and polite. All in all we had a very pleasant stay.

<Content>The old gal ain't what she used to be Well I remember this hotel from when I was younger and I got a fantastic rate because I work in the industry however, hallways needs to be updated I feel. The rooms are small but I do understand that these are old buildings so this is what you should expect. The decor however has been updated, though the linens had a rough worn feel to them. To me it wouldn't be worth the rack rate pricing. Doorman was extremely helpful and polite.Be advised the only rooms that have views are the suites that face Copley Square other than that the side rooms over look the Westin and the expressway entrance. The location is AWESOME you are right at the T green line Copley stop so easy access to downtown by way of trolley or even a very nice walk. There is the Copley Plaza Mall which has a lot of high end stores and of course Newberry Street is about a 5 minute walk. Didn't check out the restaurants we only stayed one night.Respectfully Reviewed

<Content>Quite surprising We did not have a pleasant experience at the Fairmont Copley Plaza. We got placed in the room across from the stairwell, which meant that we heard people outside our room all night. More importantly, the air conditioner stopped working in the early evening on one of the hottest nights of the year, which meant that when we returned from dinner, the room was 80 degrees and very humid. We called down to the front desk, and they called maintenance. Thirty minutes later the maintenance attendant came and said that the A/C was working fine (which it was not, incidentally). An hour later, although the thermostat was set at 64, the room was still hot and humid. We went down to the front desk to ask them if there was anything else they could do, such as fix the problem or put us in another room. They called the maintenance attendant again, who said that nothing could be done. Throughout this process, the front desk agents were extremely rude and apathetic to us during the process, even though there were no other guests who needed service. They were talking with each other, and when I tried to ask them, they would give me terse responses and refer me to maintenance. On the maintenance attendant's fourth trip to the room, he provided us with a noisy but effective table fan. We found it peculiar that the hotel front desk staff were so rude, while the maintenance attendant was quite accommodating. Lastly, we received a wake-up call at 5:00am that we did not order. So, if you're looking for a $200 room without A/C in the middle of summer in Boston, and to get woken up throughout the night by staircase traffic and finally by the front desk staff, the Fairmont Copley Plaza is the place for you. There are better choices, like the EconoLodge in Braintree.

<Content>Disappointed - luxury must mean few amenities Okay, first the good - the deluxe room I had was quite large, including the bathroom, and the bed was the best I have slept on in some time. The bathrobes were also a nice touch, and my view of Copley Square was fantastic. Now the bad: there were no rooms available when I arrived around noon - I know checkin at most hotels isn't until 3:00 or so but 99.9% of the time they have rooms available; I was able to check into Nine Zero at 10:30 a.m. when I stayed there. So I kept checking in (they did offer to call my cell phone but I didn't think it would be that long) and finally at 3:00 I was told a room was ready; however when I got up to the room housekeeping was still in there so I had to go back to the lobby and wait another 15 minutes. There is no coffee in the room; minor, I know but most hotels have free coffee. They offered to bring a coffee machine with the set-up to your room for $10 plus taxes, etc. I also didn't receive a newspaper even though when I made my reservation through the Fairmont site they asked what type of paper I wanted (national or local). For those of you who don't wash your face in the shower, the sink in the bathroom is an adventure to use (don't bump your head!) and for a hotel that has great views, I don't understand why the chair is situated on the opposite side of the room by the door; I'd rather sit in a chair by the window so I can enjoy the view. The lobby is not set up right to me; the only place for people to sit is on the opposite side of checkin near a reception room and if there is an event going on (as there was on the day I stayed) you have to hear the noise from the room. Finally, a treat for me is to order room service breakfast; don't bother. Two eggs, toast, ham, coffee and juice (no mention of potatoes on the menu I had) for $21 plus room service fee, gratuity, taxes, etc. which by my calculations would bring the total close to $30! A big disappointment and I would not likely stay there again, even with the reduced rate I paid.

<Content>Great price on their website! We booked three rooms here for two nights after my son's graduation and had a very good experience. Had been told that THE place to stay was the Ritz but after looking at the Fairmont's website and finding a summer special price of just $229 a night compared to the Ritz at $400+ I chose the Fairmont and was pleased. The FCP has been recently renovated and our room was huge and had a wonderful bed, beautiful linens and a lovely marble bathroom. When we were leaving to go to the airport, the head doorman went WAY out of his way to call several taxi companies for us and get us a minivan cab - when one arrived he refused a tip and told us to tip the guy carrying the luggage instead. Also, they have an adorable black lab that is their canine ambassador - a nice touch to make people feel at home. I would stay here again and probably would try some of their other properties.

<Content>The Bed Where Angels Fear to Tread At the last minute my husband and I decided to stay in the city after a wedding last weekend, and we chose the Fairmont. While we've stayed there often, this was our first visit to the new Gold Floor. Lots of hotel chains are now barking about their heavenly beds, well, no hotel I've been in holds a candle to the linens and bedding at the Fairmont. Really, I had flashbacks all the next day wishing I was back in the sack at the Fairmont.The hotel feels as if it was just totally renovated. Everything in the room was new and top quality. Time was, I used to feel insulted when I was given a room without a view, and our room this weekend was an interior room. but QUIET! It was like being way out in the country. No city noises at all.The gold floor has a great club kind of thing. It's about five different (all very elegant) sitting rooms with something for everyone -- fireplace, computers, butler's pantry, TV. whatever you're in the mood for.So often, there's not great value attached to club floors, but the Fairmont is different. This premium is worth every penny. And, oh, those linens.

<Content>Fairmont Copley Plaza Hi,A friend and myself just came back from Boston May 27th, and it was great. Love Boston, and both times we went there we stayed at the Fairmont Copley Plaza. The location is great, and the hotel is charming! We stayed on the Executive Floor, Fairmont Gold. It's on a private level, where there is kitchen with complimentary evening d'ouevres, honor bar, deluxe continental breakfast, computer services, comfortable lounge with a variety of dvd's and cd's. It completely exceeded our expectations. Also, you have your own concierge on that level that can help you with directions or anything you need. If you are looking to stay in Boston, you have to check out Fairmont Copley Plaza. There is also a fabulous lounge called Oak Bar, it is the nicest atmosphere to have a martini or appetizer. Stayed at the Copley Plaza prior, but staying on the Fairmont Gold floor was great. The room was also spacious, modern, comfortable and had various amenities.Boston is a great city, and we went there to see U2 in concert, and that was amazing. The concert was amazing, and having the chance to stay at the Fairmont Copley Plaza was definately a great experience too!

<Content>Hotel was fine but staff was excellent After receiving notice from the Westin across the street I would be moved 3 times during my week long stay, I called the Fairmont. Nothing but we would be glad to help, no moves and that I should consider the small upcharge for the Gold Floor. That was the best move. Staff was wonderful addressing me by name each and every day. Honor bar, 4 different rooms in the lounge, food out all time.A home away from home. While other hotels may have the views the staff is tops.

<Content>Fabulous Fairmont On the wasy to a wedding on the Cape, we thought we would treat ourselves to a night at one of Boston Grand Dame Hotels. Choosing the Fairmont Copley Plaza because of its excellent downtown location and proximity to the Amtrak station, (walking distance), we arrived at the Fairmont feeling chilly and less than elegant. Nevertheless, we were immediately swept into the warmth of the hotel by the excellent door personnel and after nary a request, shown to the Fairmont's Gold Level on the 4th floor. The hospitality there only exceeded what we had experienced on our arrival: superior concierge service, an extensive pantry of food and drink, including an honor bar, a warm fireplace, and best of all a spacious room with a completely furnished, but comfortably old- fashioned bathroom. Breakfast the next morning was worth paying for, but again it was complimentary. Kudos to the excellent management of this hotel, and all the thoughtfulness of its service personnel and excellence of design. We'll be back. Oh, yes, the price was fair and reasonable. Sincerely, ST B.

<Content>fantastic hotel Although it was rainy and cold day at the end of may the Fairmont hotel was warm and friendly. The hotel was just so impeccably beautiful and the room so classy and homey. The bed was unbelievably comfortable. The service was also outstanding as was the restaurant. An added attraction for me was katie copley the black lab who greets you when you arrive. I have 2 labs myself so I was so excited. I had no idea it was a dog friendly hotel.I hope to visit boston again and would not even try another hotel. We had relatives staying at the ritz carlton which was also quite beautiful but the room was not anywhere as nice as the Fairmont.

<Content>4 star..... Are they Joking !!!!! This review is one of 3 I hope to leave regarding our stay in LA (Sheraton Anaheim)/Las Vegas (Luxor)/Boston (Fairmont Copley Plaza).This is my review of the Fairmont Copley Plaza.We arrived at this hotel on the 30th April, checked in and taken by the Bell Boy up to our room. Outside this was a huge pile of dirty bed linen from a few rooms, he apologised for this and said it would be removed as quick as possible. He was really good as he showed us all around our room. Then got a map and explained where we should visit and all the places we should go.We unpacked and decided to go and look around the hotel, also take a walk outside round the hotel just to get our barings.It was pouring with rain so we decided to come back in via another entrance after about 5 mins. We decided to go to the Oak Bar and have a drink. As we walked up to the Bar we were told by a very curt man that there was a line and we would not be able to go in for at least 1/2 an hour.I went back to the Bell Boy and asked him if guests had to queue, he said unfortunately yes, but as the line was short it should only be about 5 mins ??We went back to our room, greeted still with all the Bed linen and when I thought about it, I wondered if the guy at the Bar had thought we had just walked off the street to come in for a drink, we were wet through, had Jeans and T shirts on and perhaps did not really want us to come in to the Bar. I got a little angry and we decided to put other clothes on and go down again.Funny, this time we were let straight in...After a good Apple Martini and a Pina Colada, some nice food we went to bed at around 12.00. (Linen still outside our room).I noticed when I pulled the curtains a huge lorry outside the hotel with its engine running and thought no more about it.30 mins later it got noiser and noiser, when I looked out of the window the lorry had been joined by 2 others and were clearing out all the equipment from a wedding that had taken place that night.This went on for another 3 hours.By this time I had, had enough of engines running, banging and men shouting.I rang down to Reception and was apologised for this and was told it never usually happens, would I like to change room. I said, What at 3.00 in the morning. He again apologised for this and said it would not go on much longer, it wont happen again.After 20 mins it all stopped and I finally got some sleep. Not for long. At 8.00 a.m. another lorry with its engine going was outside the hotel delivering something.By this time I could not believe it.I got dressed and went down to reception.I was again apologised to and was told that the hotel is on an E ?? and in a busy area. I was told I could change room and I went to look at this.This room was right over Traffic Lights with yet again Cars waiting and their engines going. I woke my husband and he came down to Reception with me.Again we had the excuse that the Hotel is sited on an E and noise could not be helped.When I explained I had stayed in the center of New York and my husband who is a world traveller and has stayed in some of the Best and Worst Hotels in the world and have never experienced anything like this, she just kept repeating the same thing over and over.We were told that she did have another room but it had an internal view.This did not worry us as we only had a couple of days there, and we were not going to be in the room that much anyway.This room was fine so we had to repack, and take all our luggage up to the third room.By the way, the bed linen had now been removed and replaced with dirty glasses ??After moving all our stuff (let face it, this is the last thing you want to be doing when you have had no sleep, its your first day of only 2, and its not off to a great start) we decided to venture out.Boston was great and all the sites were wonderful to see.The trolley buses were very very good. If you get Karin or Ernie you will have a great time.Back to the Hotel. We did try on our last night the Oak Lounge and this is the Hotels saving grace. The service was top notch and the food was lovely.Prices are quite steep but everything was good.Our last night we told the Reception that we had a late flight the next day and they agreed to let us check out at 3.00 pm.At 2.30 our key stopped working so back down to Reception we went and they sorted this out.When we finally went back to our room we asked Conciege to pick our bags up as we were leaving.20 mins later we were still waiting. In the end we finally had enough and brought them down ourselves.The hotel is very grand and is elegant. The rooms are lovely, though little features like a clean shower curtain, a sink that holds water...(did not bother asking them to fix it, my husband did this to save time) would be more appreciated.As for 4 stars and above, that is side splitting.Would I stay in this hotel again......... never.Would I recommend this hotel.......... not in a million years. Just go for dinner.And always remember..... its sited on an E......... ???????Well the services gets a D +.

<Content>Great Location, Wonderful Hotel We had a wonderful time at the Fairmont Copley Plaza. We love Fairmont Hotels and this was a gem. Alway stay on Gold Floors if possible. However, there are only a few with Gold Floors in the US. The staff is great and went out of their way to accommodate our requests. We did get an upgrade but we do stay quite a bit at Fairmonts and that is what we love about them. They value repeat customers. The Gold Floor was one of the best. The food was outstanding and we enjoyed every minute. We just came from the Toronto Fairmont Royal York and it was also very good. Be sure to take the Old Town Trolley Tour and hopefully you will get Karen as a driver and guide. She is terrific. You will have a great time and it is a good way to see the city. We only had two days and we saw a great deal. Ask the concierge for suggestions for restaurants. They are always great.Fairmonts usually have a loveable dog in residence that you can take for a walk if you like. Very nice added touch. Thanks to the Fairmont Copley Plaza and staff, we had a memorable stay in Boston.

<Content>Great stay at the Fairmont Copley The staff, service, food and ambiance at the Fairmont were excellent. It has been a few years since we stayed there and found that hotel (including rooms) has been remodeled. The staff all seemed truly happy- didn't get that artificial friendly vibe that exists in many higher end hotels. My wife loved the black lab Katie that was typically in the lobby or front entrance. Service in dining area was excellent! Would definatley go back-

<Content>Elegant classic style charm Stayed at this hotel for a conference and found it a delightful change from the usual generic business hotel: entering the lobby found an eclectic mixture of crystal chandeliers, gilding--and the hotel's own black lab curled up next to the concierge's desk. Service polite and efficient. Food was excellent. The meeting room had such rare convention-room architectural amenities as windows and columned arches, highly refreshing in a world of cookie-cutter ballrooms. I had one of the smaller rooms (as I compare my experience with those of other reviewers); its downside was that there was no comfortable place to sit in the room, albeit it was clean and well-decorated. Since in Boston I tend not to waste much time staying in a hotel room, the absence of a comfortable chair was not particularly a problem. Hotel location was excellent, with numerous enjoyable walks available in all directions. If you value a well-kept elegant older hotel, you'll like it here.

<Content>Gracious We spent two nights at the refurbished Copley Plaza in March 2005. Our room was booked on their Gold level (club floor) and at a 'special rate that made it even more appealing. Check in was on the same floor as the room and was handled very nicely. The room was very comfortable, especially the bed and well equipped if not a little over decorated. Bathroom was small but very nice and had all amenities including a scale and good makeup mirror.The club area was very nice and unusual in that it was comprised of a series of rooms rather than one large area so you could have a little privacy. The complimentary breakfast was much nicer than a typical continental breakfast and the evening cocktails and hors d'oeuvre great. Both were served in the equivilent of a butlers pantry adjacent to the other areas. All in all, a pleasant stay with a very polite and accomadating staff without exception.

<Content>A Fantastic Hotel My husband and I just returned from a trip to Boston. We spent 4 nights at the Fairmont Copley Plaza and loved it. The staff was polite and helpful, the lobby very beautiful, the location was very central, and the room was gorgeous. We had a King size signature room (which was a complimentary upgrade from the deluxe room we reserved) overlooking Copley Plaza. The room was substantial, complete with opulent fabrics, a triple-sheeted bed, and a chandelier with a dimmer switch. The bathroom was also large, with beautiful marble tile, and robes to enjoy during our stay. It is just two blocks from the fun shops on Newbury Street, a block from the orange and green T-lines (subway), a couple blocks from the Boston Common, and right next door to the Westin which connects to an indoor 3-level shopping mall. If you check on the Fairmont's website, you can book a room three weeks in advance and get a 20% discount off the best available rate. We found this offer in the right hand margin, and when we called to inquire, the lady on the phone was aware of it also. It has to be booked online, so watch the margin as you flip through the website.We also found that Boston was truly a walking city. If you are not bringing a car, do not opt to rent one. Between the subway and buses you can get just about anywhere, and from what we saw while walking around, the drivers are not particularly courteous and parking is at a premium. You can get visitor passes for Boston's mass transit from the website, or at most of the stations.Enjoy your trip, and don't hesitate to stay at the Fairmont.

<Content>Fantastic Fairmont!! Just returned from a lovely weekend stay at the Fairmont Copley Plaza. When we first walked into the hotel we were overwelmed by the opulance of the lobby. Everything was simply fantastic. The guest room was very comfortable yet luxuriously decorated. I felt like a princess. Most of all, the staff was fantastic. They were very friendly and went out of their way to make us feel right at home. We will be sure to choose the Fairmont Copley Plaza the next time that we travel to Boston. Thank you Fairmont.

<Content>Stuffy, charmless and over rated! During our visit to the Fairmont, we checked out as fast as we checked in. The rooms, do not give you the bang for you buck. There is no charm, amentites, or warmth to the room and bathrooms. Our first room, we were not impressed, and then we lead to a more superior room, and there was nothing superior about it. Why bother with the gold room when you are surrounded by enough tacky gold as it is. As far as bringing your friends or tourist to a brouse around the main lobby, that is definatly a treat. But please treat yourself to a more modern boutique hotel, because Boston is a charming city and you deserve all the charm in your room as well.

<Content>First Class all the way My husband and I just returned from a weekend at The Fairmont Copley. We had initially booked a Signature room with a king-sized bed. When we went to check in we were told that there was a mistake in booking (thankfully I had a printed confirmation from their websight stating what I had booked) and they were upgrading us to a room in Fairmont Gold(club level). Club level is very nice for a business traveler or someone who wants a bed and breakfast feel in the city, but I knew when we made our reservation that we just wanted a very nice room without all the bells and whistles.   We were escorted to our room and upon entering I realized it was half the size of the room we had reserved. My husband then went to the concierge and he found a two room suite also on club level and then realized that our Signature room we had originally reserved was now available. Apparently there was a mix-up with our reservation at the front desk. The gentleman who helped us (I believe his name was Ben) got us settled into our room and then made sure we had a complimentary breakfast sent to our room. He was very nice and very apologetic.  I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again. It is first class all the way. Everyone is very helpful and very accomodating. It's also in a great location with easy walking distance to shops,Newbury street, Theater district and public transportation.   It isn't cheap but definetly worth the splurge for business or a relaxing weekend. The rooms are immaculate and very quiet.

<Content>Old World Charm, but..... Stayed at the Fairmont and found the location excellent....across the street from Copley Plaza, steps away from Prudential Center and Newbury Street. Dinner at the Oak Room was nice, and the Oak Bar is gorgeous.The check-in staff was friendly and helpful. I liked the room at first glance, charming, old world, bb style, etc. When I went to the bathroom, I found hair in the tub and sink, and the tub needed to be reglazed. When I called the front desk to advise them of my hairy discovery, they apologized and offered to have someone clean the bathroom, and then when I noticed hair on the ledge next to the desk, I started to wonder what other things I might find. They agreed to take me to a new room, and when the helpful porter, Gary (?) arrived to take me to the new room, he inspected it and embarassingly found hair in the sink in the new room. It wasn't in the bathtub, and so I didn't want to make anymore fuss and just wanted to get settled in my new room. By asking for a new room, I wanted to give them the opportunity to remedy the problem, so I would not have to write a less than positive review.When I arrived back to NY, I noticed that they billed my credit card for the minibar, when I didn't even use the minibar. When I called their accounting department, they reversed the charges, and implied that it wasn't a mistake on their part, but that they would reverse their charges.The hotel is beautiful, and location is excellent, but the staff could be more gracious, less aloof to suggestions, and this is really why I decided to write this review. I understand taking pride in the property you work in, but arrogance is unacceptable, since suggestions are there to improve the hotel. I found this with both the hotel front desk and accounting department.I have stayed in 3 to 5 star hotels in over 20 countries, four continents, and have never seen hair in the bathroom or have been charged from the minibar for drinks not consumed. These mistakes should not have happened since the housekeeping manager should inspect the room prior to it being rented out. There are clearly housekeeping issues that the general manager of the hotel needs to address.

<Content>Fairmont Copley...Wonderful!! Stayed at the Fairmont Copley this past weekend. Great hotel and location. Across the street from Copley Place, Prudential, Hynes Center. There is also a Shaws supermarket about 2 blocks away. Pharmacy (CVS) across the street. Boston Public Gardens and Common are a 15-20 minute walk away. Within walking distance to Downtown Crossing (Macy's, Filene's, etc.). Green line (T) right across the street. Newbury St is about 3-4 blocks away...have lunch at Stephanie's. The hotel is older and charming. Room was in great shape, comfortable bed and large well-stocked bathroom.Stay at the Copley...you won't be sorry!

<Content>European Elegance and Service in Boston I travel often for business, and have visited Boston several times. This was my first visit to the Fairmont, and I was less than hopeful when I saw my rate - of the half dozen hotels in the area that I checked, the Fairmont was the cheapest by far. What a surprise when I checked in! The lobby is incredibly beautiful. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I was upgraded to a deluxe room which was quite grand. A family of four would have been very comfortable in this room. The bathroom was huge and luxurious. My client, who was traveling with me received an equally nice upgrade. The room service menu was limited and average, but the staff was quick and courteous. I never have high expectations for hotel room service anyway. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>W O W - Thank you for the great time The Copley Plaza in Boston was nothing short of a great experience. The staffs' incredible hospitality and graciousness extended to me and my colleague during our whirlwind visit on November 2nd to The Fairmont Gold Level made me hooked. It's home away from home (if not better).  Apart from a great night's sleep, fabulous thick towels, prompt wake up calls, fruit, bottled water and cookies - their exceptionally trained staff who were personable, fun and always ready to assist - I got to ride in the elevator with James Taylor, hear Sheryl Crow do a sound check, watch Black Eyed Peas perform, have a moments with Catie Copley (their lab) at the front door and do serious damage at Chanel. Oh yes, and do the buying for Christmas for my floral company, Petals. What more could a gal ask for. My only regret was that I did not extend my thanks to the senior staff in person.  I cannot thank them enough. What would have been a standard business trip turned out to be something quite memorable.

<Content>Best Weekend Ever This is the email that we sent to the general manager of the Fairmont as we were so overwhelmed with the excellent service. (side note - the gm sent back a note within minutes, which I was very impressed with).Written on Sunday, October 24, 2004Dear Sir,On Thursday, October 21, 2004 at 6:00 a.m. my fianc茅 and I logged on to boston to look for a hotel room to accompany our tickets to game one of the world series. After a good bit of searching we found only one hotel with rooms left, the Fairmont at Copley plaza. We reviewed the rooms and were pleased to find the Fairmont Gold rooms were available. We had to phone in the reservation in lieu of booking on-line due to a glitch which did not recognize our new address (a common problem with new developments). Once I rang through to Lynn, in reservations, she was most helpful, courteous and thoughtful. Little did I realize that this was just the beginning of the amazing and outstanding service we would receive.We received excellent directions via telephone and were promptly welcomed when we arrived at the front door. We proceeded directly to the fourth floor, as instructed by Lynn. We were greeted by Ben at the concierge desk.  Ben was warm, helpful and made us feel truly at home. After the tour of the lounge, Ben gave very accurate and simple directions to a local store where we were able to find gloves for the chilly evening that lay ahead. Once we discovered that our luggage had not made it鈥檚 way to our room Ben made sure our luggage was delivered post haste.The lounge was very relaxing, the food was delicious and the beverage selection more than accommodating. We were impressed with the quality, selection, presentation and pricing of the offerings in the lounge. The hot apple cider and availability of coffee was very appreciated as was the casual and quick breakfast that we enjoyed before the journey home. The instant online access to the hotel鈥檚 computers as well as the in-room DVD player and the library of DVDs were a great amenity as dragging the laptop around the country can be cumbersome and annoying when all we really use it for is internet access and viewing DVDs.All the staff that we interacted with at the Fairmont Copley, from the door men to room service, were simply amazing. We felt truly welcome and at home. We have stayed at many fine hotels including Soffitel and the Ritz Carlton and none have exceeded our expectations as the team at the Fairmont Copley has. Where other hotels made us self conscious via their 鈥渟nooty鈥?and unwelcome attitudes the Fairmont has made us feel welcome and more like guests than customers.This evening, after a very long drive home, we began unpacking only to discover that my dear, sweet fianc茅, Dan, left behind his world series program that he had been flipping though after the game last night. As you can imagine this was devastating for a Massachusetts born and raised Red Sox fan. We immediately phoned the hotel and spoke with the fourth floor concierge. She was concerned and expediently helpful. Within minutes she returned our call informing us that Ben (the aforementioned excellent team member) was able to head straight for our room to locate Dan鈥檚 program. We were thrilled to hear that it was being sent via FedEx as soon as possible.Being a former hospitality team member (after earning degrees in food service and hospitality) it is honestly a pleasure to find such a special place to stay where the staff seem truly happy to be 鈥渁t the office.鈥?br/>Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for helping make this weekend so very special (the Red Sox helped too).As this was our last weekend as single people (we are to be married this coming Sunday) we wanted something special, and we are thrilled that it was a truly memorable experience. Having Ben and the Gold Team was like having trusted friends on hand to help with every need. Never before have we stayed at an establishment that felt so much like visiting, and so little like being customers.Thank you to all the staff and their managers. We are thrilled to have somewhere so special to stay, despite (or in spite?) of the always available twin beds at my soon-to-be mother-in-law鈥檚 house just south of the city. We look forward to returning to the Fairmont on our next trip to New England.Sincerely,Jenn

<Content>Fabulous Fairmont in Boston Divine Decadence would describe my long weekend at the Fairmont Copley Square Hotel in Boston, MA. From the moment your car pulls up to the curb, you know you've arrived at a special destination with the doorman and bellman welcoming and assisting you as well as the Fairmont's own resident dog, a real charmer and available for walks and jogs with the hotel guests. The Hotel itself is opulently beautiful the hallway entrance leading to the front desk reminded me a bit of the Hall of Mirrors in the Versaille Palace I visited this summer in France. However, its beauty is not overwhelming for the guest but rather inviting and cozy being only a six storey hotel in an incredible location in the Back Bay Area. The rooms are well appointed and roomy and there's a turn down service at night and instead of a chocolate on your pillow, there's a welcome bottle of water on the night table. The staff are friendly and helpful and don't miss a chance to have a drink or take a meal in the Oak Room - its gorgeous. Lastly, the Fairmont's Concierge staff are the tops - bar none - and I've travelled extensively. They were able to match our tastes and budgets for each evening's dinner venue and arrange for the restaurant manager to take care of us like VIPs. Take advantage of this wonderful service!! Boston is a great destination so why night pair it with a stay in great hotel!

<Content>Great Hotel From the time you enter the Fairmont Copley through your departure the service is excellent.The Copley is situated at Copley Sq. with easy access to shopping on Newbury St., the Copley Sq. and Prudentiall Malls are right next store,and the subway is a block away.The hotel is decorated with lovely historical pictures and is furnished with early American furniture. Rooms are comfortable and spacious.When visiting the Copley be sure to have a bite to eat in the famous Oak room.Our visit to Boston was much more enjoyable because we stayed at The Fairmont Copley Plaza.

<Content>Wonderfull hotel A really fabulous hotel. Amazing entrance lobby with huge fresh flower displays, plenty of glass, gold, mirrors  chandeliers. To get the best out of this hotel use the Executive floor which has a comfortable private lounge with free refreshments and light snacks all day. It's great to use this hotel as a base, go out for a few hours, come back to the nice lounge and recharge with a snack and drink before going out again.

<Content>good, not great Overall, my impression was a good hotel yet not that great a value. Stayed here for 3 nights for a conference. On the plus side, it has a great location and is a beautiful hotel. Food was good; had lunch and dinner there. Staff offered to mail my postcard despite my not having a stamp (although if the gift shop sold stamps as well as postcards that wouldn't have been an issue.) Based on previous reviews, the room sizes must vary since I had a big room with (only) the low conference rate. Bath amenities were large and good quality. Bed and pillows quite good. Quiet room. On the down side: it's understandable that food in the Oak Room is expensive, but there is no cheaper, less formal place to eat in the hotel. No coffeemaker in the room. Had to request another bar of soap; most hotels give you a fresh bar each day. Desk staff said they could cash a check, then didn't have enough cash on hand - that can happen, but they didn't offer any alternative (other than an ATM down the street that would've incurred charges). Service at the Oak Bar was so slow (yet not very crowded), I finally got my own menu after waiting 15 mintues. The parking valet called me a cab upon check-out, indicating one would be there in a minute or two. He then directed me to a hotel entrance that had no doorman - so after many minutes with no cab in sight I had to haul my luggage back inside, and back across the lobby to the valet in order to tell him that a cab never came. He then asked, would you like me to call again? I had to fight the urge to give a smart---- answer - and merely answered in the affirmative. The room info indicated my bill would be under my door the morning of departure - but it was not. (However, the video check-out worked fine, and my bill was indeed ready for me by the time I got downstairs.) In conclusion, this is a nice play to stay if one ignores most of the hype.

<Content>Nice hotel, didn't live up to expectations I recently attended a medical conference that was being held at the hotel and had the opportunity to stay overnight for 3 evenings. The hotel is in a nice location with many things to see and do in the area. The hotel itself, however, was rather disappointing. My room had new furniture, but it was tiny, dark and dirty. Not worth the $259 conference rate. The staff was very average at best. All of the water glasses in my room were dirty, I approached the housekeeper for new ones and she went in to my room and proceeded to wash the glasses in my bathroom sink! Ordered coffee through room service each morning as there was not a coffeemaker in the room, it was sent to me each day on a dirty tray with threadbare napkins. The room for our meetings was loud and very worn. Food prepared by the hotel for the meeting was just ok, not worth the registration fee for the conference.

<Content>so so Stayed at the Copley recently for a conference. Found it quite average. Rooms were small, and the hotel is dated. Food provided by the hotel was average, and somewhat disappointing. Would never pay full price to stay there.

<Content>Fairmont Copley Plaza is better than ever A recent weekend spent at The Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel with out of town relatives was a delight. The renovated rooms were beautiful, elegant and comfortable. The bathrooms were luxurious. The professional staff and friendly resident pooch Catie made us feel right at home. I slept better than I have in ages.The experience was wonderful and the location can't be beat.

<Content>Beautiful Lobby, Good location Just returned from a 3 day stay in Boston (July 2004). The Fairmont Copley Plaza is located in a great area just in between Newbury Street and Boylston Street which are two major shopping streets. The hotel has a lot of old world charm. We stayed in the newly renovated rooms, are roomwas actually one of the smallest rooms they have.The room was fine and bathrooms just fine as well.This is an old building, so it is not sound proof, but,when your in a large historical city, it's nice to stayin a historical hotel.The only complaint we had was the business center. We didnot bring our laptop because we had read about their businesscenter. This was a mistake. The business center which consisted of onecomputer, was only open until 5pm and seemed to close periodically throughout the day. For such a large property this was a littledisappointing.This hotel is a good choice for it's location and I wouldstay here again. Enjoy Boston!!

<Content>Go for the Gold! My friend and I stayed at Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston this weekend. We were really dazzled by the changes in this venerable 'grade dame' of Boston! I understand it has just undergone a $34 million renovation鈥攁nd the results are truly inspiring. I stayed on the Fairmont GOLD floor鈥攖he 4th floor! From our warm and welcoming arrival, being greeted by name, to the deft handling of luggage and check-in and -out, everything here far exceeded our expectations! The new decor is absolutely imposing but not too staid. We felt like royalty, and were regally treated by desk, housekeeping, concierge, lounge staff and every encounter we had with the staff was impressive. Aside from the impressive array of creature comforts and amenities, the guest service is totally impeccable ... these folks really went way out of their way to make you feel like the lounge was your own living room, seeing to your every need and whim and leaving no wish unfulfilled. The Lounge offers and sumptuous continental breakfast buffet and the service is deft and professional. There was a wide array of goodies both at breakfast and during the hors d'oeuvres (available from afternoon until 11pm). These are placed in an eye-opening serving area, with marble and gleaming china and silverware greeting the eye. These luxurious environs truly stimulated the appetite and the complimentary newspapers, DVD library, wireless internet service and flawless decor were way beyond what we expected!To us, we felt like we were visiting the 'Boston Back Bay' townhouse of a dear friend and each inviting room made us linger over coffee, cocktails and the day's newspaper. We were amazed just how quiet and serene the floor was ... no ambient noise and even voices seemed hushed and peaceful! Then returning to our room was a real treat ... classic decor, marble bath, generous and pampering amenities ... even custom business cards with my name! Even when we left, the bellman who loaded our luggage into the car knew our names and even where home' was! Mighty impressive indeed!This was truly a first-class stay and we can't wait to return to the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel! William DeSousa
