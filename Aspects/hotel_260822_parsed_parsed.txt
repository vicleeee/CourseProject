<Content>Good hotel, nice location A nice hotel, very closely located to the duomo and other major attractions. Helpful staff, good breakfast. The room was smallish but in good condition. Very comfortable. Sadly, no internet access.

<Content>Great Staff and location but some drawbacks Hotel Perseo has two overwhelming positives which outweigh the negatives which we also experienced.I'll get the negative stuff out of the way first. The entrance to the hotel is pretty grim and the reception is on the third floor. Lift can be slow and my GF said she felt a little uneasy taking the stairs at night. We were also woken up a few times at night by the plumbing or AC or something. Now to the positives....the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. They booked museums, restaurants etc. for us and gave great advice about transport and other useful tips. Nothing was too much trouble for them and everthing was handled with a smile. Also, the location is a stones throw from the Duomo and the train station, and the rooms are very clean and modern. I would certainly stay here again despite the downsides mentioned.

<Content>Great location, value  The conceirge here was enormously helpful in making all the reservations for the museums here - including the Uffizi. You MUST make reservations during the season and the hotel (with a set of times we wanted to go where and alternates) did all this for us. We simply could not have gotten to all the places we wanted to without their help. (And we did not need to buy tickets from the scalpers either).The hotel is very well located - a short block from the Duomo, a short walk from the train station.The only negatives: breakfast is more modest than some hotels (they don't run a full kitchen) and the ground floor entrance is somewhat dreary. (The hotel occupies 2 floor several flights up.) Once in a while the elevator is held open for a minute and taes time to arrive.The hotel is very reasonably priced; rooms are small-ish but very nicely decorated and comfortable. All in all the hotel is excellent value, and their help in arranging our museum visits was simply invaluable.

<Content>Best Small Hotel in Florence My wife and I spend a few wonderful days at the end of September at Hotel Il Perseo. We discovered a refresingly intimate small hotel, tucked in between typical Florence shop facades and in earshot from the exuisite Duomo and all its wonderful sights and sounds. Do not be fooled by the ordinary and understated entrance, although nothing in Florence is ordinary one must add, this one leads you to a small elevator and a very simple third floor entrance lobby. You will be met by either Laura or Tani at front desk, always available and eager to assit. A small brightly coloured breakfeast area welcomes you every morning to help you kick start your busy day....and in Florence you have to start early....so much to see!! We have been around a bit and have stayed at 'posh' places, but for excellent value, exceedingly friendly service, spacious and airy rooms and just good honest people you will have to travel far and wide to find beter. We absolutely loved it and in our book Il Perseo is the best small hotel in Florence!! We can't wait to go back!Japie and Joyce Kemp, Paarl, South Africa

<Content>Fantastic! Cannot say enough good things about the Perseo and Louise! The hotel is new and the rooms are nicely appointed and a very good size. The staff took wonderful care of us, and were always ready to offer us advice and assistance. They had excellent dining recommendations.As others have noted, the hotel is within 50 meters of the Duomo and the midst of all that Firenze has to offer. We will absolutely stay there again.

<Content>Brilliant hotel, lovely staff Stayed at the Perseo for two nights with my mum and it was great. Really central - 5 mins walk from the train station and 2 mins from the Duomo.The staff were all really lovely - sorted us out with bus tickets, restaurants etc and were just so friendly and helpful.The room was really quite big and the bathroom was new - everything was spotlessly clean.Breakfast was good, standard continental - breads, cheeses, meats etc - but really fresh.I spent ages looking for a Florence hotel and was delighted with my final decision, much better location and price than others I'd considered.Cant recommend this hotel highly enough!

<Content>Spectacular Value In The Heart of Florance In a city crowded with hotels, Il Perseo stands out with spectacular value and a location that can't be beat. I'm always dubious when a hotel advertises itself as centrally-located, but Il Perseo lives up to this claim. It is literally steps from the Duomo (on a busy thoroughfare, but that can't be helped) and within a short walking distance of every major sight (I know, because I walked to them all). Il Perseo offers bright, well-appointed rooms with free high-speed internet access, modern bathrooms, a welcoming breakfast room and lounge, and a friendly, knowledgeable staff. I stayed there off-season, and at a discount for six nights, but their rates are still low for what they offer, and an incredible value when compared to many of their time-worn counterparts. When I am in Italy, I usually stay at five-star hotels, but I chose Il Perseo because the other options in Florence seemed overpriced and, frankly, not worth the cost. I wasn't disappointed. Minor quibbles -- the free toiletries were very basic (I had to run out and buy shampoo upon arrival) and the breakfast fruit was canned. But there were fresh cornutti, rolls, and cold cuts, and a staff member was always on hand to bring me a refill of cappucino. In all, a very satisfactory experience, and a hotel I will recommend to my friends.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location We just returned from a 2 week trip of France and Italy, we stayed in 5 hotels. The hotels is an easy 5-10 min walk from the train station which is how we arrived. We used the map on the website to find the hotel and it was easy. We stayed in room 303 which was a triple. Upon arrival we had a choice of 2 rooms. We got a welcome glass of wine since we arrived during happy hour. The man at the desk from Albania was very kind and gracious. We told him our son was allergic to peanuts which was on ongoing challenge in France and Italy. He offered to call ahead to a restaraunt for us to make sure they did not use peanut oil. Nice Touch!!! He also pointed out the area where they have a lot of leather for sale. We ended up buying two jackets. Any questions we had for the staff were always handled with a smile and a real desire to help. We had a queen size bed and my son was on a twin which looked like it could turn into a bunk bed. The room was spacious and very clean and quiet. The shower worked well and we used the heated towel rack to dry clothes we washed. Breakfast consisted of a few cold cereals, toast, choice of pastries, juices, meats, cheeses, expresso, capuccino, hard boiled eggs, a nice spread to start the day. The hotel is very well located. After climbing to the top of the Duomo one day we went back to the hotel for a break. It is literally a few hundred yards down the street. It is also located close to my son's favorite gelato store in Florence.We got an online special for a family of 3 direct from the hotel website which was the cheapest way to book them at the time. We got a room for 3 with breakfast for 99 euro per night. This was the lowest price for a highly rated property.They also made reservations for me at the Uffizi and the Accedemia. They also told me a trick that when we walk up if no line don't use the resevation number just buy the ticket, you save 4 euro per person. We did that at both places. We would not have known without the local touch. Last comment. This was a major trip for us, I spent a lot of time researching hotels and us TA extensively. I was not dissapointed. Every property met or exceeded my expectatons.

<Content>Hotel il Perseo - a great stay in the heart of Firenze Travelled to Florence and stayed at Il Perseo for a night in November 2008. The booking process was convenient and the response to inquiries was prompt and helpful.On arrival, the staff were very friendly and spoke English well. Everyone was very helpful, and the owners are charming. The hotel's proximity to the Firenze SMN station as well as its location down the street from the Duomo is great.Our room was good - a couple problems (beds weren't great; the heater was overheating the room), however, the room was very clean, the bathroom was great, and it was spacious by Italian standards (though not by North American standards). Nicely, simply decorated. I forgot my internet cable (there's wired high-speed in the rooms) but the staff kindly supplied me with one.The breakfast was excellent and the morning cappuccino a fantastic touch. Do yourself a favour and stick to espresso-based drinks and forget about the American-style coffee. The hotel also provides a happy hour from 6-8 pm every night, with snacks and a glass of wine, which was quite good!On checking out, we needed to leave our bags for a few more hours of shopping in the city. The owner was kind enough to store our bags securely.Il Perseo was renovated a couple years ago (I stayed in it before it was renovated) - it has been greatly improved without sacrificing the service. Enormous value for the money here.

<Content>Loved the hotel. Clean, large rooms with excellent view of Duomo! We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights in November 2008 and wished we stayed longer!Our room was large, modern and very well-insulated from the cold outside. The bathroom was clean and came with towel warmer and the bed was perfect size and firm. We also had a nice view of the Duomo from the room. The staff at reception were helpful, friendly and very hospitable. A very nice touch is the free use of the hotel's notebook and internet service.Excellent location, rooms and service. We will definitely stay there again!

<Content>Wonderful Welcome We just spent four lovely days in Florence at this hotel. The staff are topnotch - very welcoming and very willing to help with questions/advice. Laura, in particular, was a sweetheart. Since we were on a two week trip she made special arrangements for our laundry on the weekend when the service isn't usually offered. The hotel is very centrally located, just down from the Duomo, which was ideal for sightseeing. Due to other reviews on this site we had no trouble at all finding the hotel. The only thing I wasn't aware of in advance is that there is a metal railing between the street and the sidewalk that does make unloading a taxi somewhat challenging if you have big bags.The breakfast was definitely more than enough for us - very satisfied with the quality. We had a family room, 3 adults and a toddler, and had plenty of room.All in all a wonderful time in Florence, and we will definitely stay at the Perseo if we get to go back to Florence.

<Content>Fabulous Authentic Italian Hotel My husband and I were in Italy for our honeymoon and stayed in Florence for 5 nights. We typically stay at Marriott properties but there are none in Florence so we decided to venture out and try something new. After reading a lot of reviews on TA about Il Perseo we decided to go ahead and book it. We got a great deal that they were offering for Fall in Florence. It is conveniently located within walking distance to the train station which was a bonus for us. When we arrived to the hotel and realized the lobby was on the 3rd floor we were a little concerned but once we got up there (in the very small and old elevator) we couldn't be happier. The gentleman at the front desk was the owner and so nice. He walked us to our upgraded room and made sure that we were comfortable and happy. How could we not be happy we had a HUGE room with a view of the Duomo! Our room had a large bed, a sitting area and a nice size bathroom with a huge shower. The service from all the staff is top notch, they offer complimentary wine in the evening and breakfast in the morning. They are located steps from the Duomo in the heart of Florence. We felt very safe walking all over the city at anytime of the day. Since Florence was my favorite stop on our trip I will definitely be returning and staying at Il Perseo! Great hotel, great location, great staff!!!!

<Content>Great location, friendly staff! Hotel Il Perseo is a nice little family hotel in the heart of Florence. It is really close to Il Duomo, which makes it very easy to find, and close to everything. The place is clean and cheerful and the staff is very friendly. They even helped me to make reservations to various museums, and finding out about exhibits, prior to my visit. Breakfast was included in the price, and it was delicious. I wish I could get coffee like that back at home!I do plan to go back to Florence within the next year, and I am planning on staying at Il Perseo.

<Content>Great hotel; great location We liked everything about this hotel. The location -- just 1 block from the Duomo -- is unbeatable. The staff was friendly and helpful, particularly with advance reservations. The rooms were modern, clean and fairly roomy by European standards. Breakfast was simple but good. We enjoyed the complimentary glass of wine each afternoon, too.

<Content>excellent 4 nights with Siena/Chianti tour included We are a British couple in our mid thirties who like to travel independently, getting good value as much as possible! We have just had a brilliant stay of 4 nights at Hotel Perseo and thought it was good value for money. We found it to be very central, clean and extremely friendly. I had actually booked Alloro Bb but they messed up my booking (ie. not booked us in, despite a few emails and booking in July) and I found Perseo on Tripadvisor a day before we were due to leave for Italy. The reviews were good and as we were going for 4 nights we were entitled to the free Chianti country/Siena tour by booking directly through their website. We were going to go to Siena by bus on the Monday anyway so this was a bonus. They responded very quickly with the confirmation, so I was relieved. Finding Perseo: Walking took 5 mins from the bus station (we got the bus from Pisa). It may be number 1 Via de Cerretani but that doesn't mean it's at the end of the block due to the eccentric Italian numbering system. The actual location is next to Accessorize and opposite the junction with Via Fernando Zannetti. Look for the big open door with Hotel Perseo above it in big letters. There is a lift shaft within, which you just get into and press the button for the 3rd floor. Once on the 3rd floor you'll see the reception area. We had no problem with the plain ground level entrance - it wasn't seedy as some reviewers have said, but simply a doorway. Rooms: The hotel was renovated in 2006 and the general feel is clean and modern. Extremely clean room. Comfortable bed with duvet and good quality cotton bedlinen. Not much of a view but not a problem. TV with BBC world news and CNN, air con, tiled floor, shower cubicle (water was hotter some days than others), hairdryer and magnifying mirror in the bathroom. Toiletries sachets and drinking glasses disposable plastic. The water tank/plumbing was rumbling away a bit on a few nights (possibly typically Italian?) but I slept through it most of the time (chianti helped!)Happy Drink! between 6 and 8pm every night you can sit in the communal areas and drink a free glass of red or white wine and fill up a plate with crisps and other nibbles. Really good idea - we thought this contributed to the general friendliness very well.Breakfast: as others have said - self service pastries and rolls toast (white sliced), jams, nutella, honey, hard boiled eggs, ham, salami, cheese, philadelphia, cereals, fruit salad, 2 types of fruit juice. Selection of Twinings teas inc green tea, earl grey etc. Not bad at all.The tour to Siena is a new intiative and Louise (the very friendly owner) told us we were the first to book it through them. Well I can recommend it thoroughly. You have to go to a square 5 mins walk away for 9.30 then get on a minibus (up to 24 people). We worried we might be shepherded around in a massive group with no freedom as we like to travel independently as much as possible but it was fine. There were 16 of us, all ages (early 20s to 60s) We visited Monteriggio for 40 mins (small walled Tuscan village) Castellani in Chianti for a wander, and then went to an organic farm (Tenuta Casanova I think it's called, from googling) where they create wine, balsamic vinegar , biscuits, soaps, essential oils etc and grow all sorts of wonderful plants and vegetables. We were given a tour of the place then had a really delicious home made lunch of chickpeas, polenta and ice cream with 30 yr old balsamic on it plus various types of wine. While we ate we were told all about what we were eating and drinking and it was very interesting. They do cookery courses there too. Of course it was all there to buy and not cheap, but it was obvious that the owners have real passion for their craft. The we drove to Siena where we had 3 hours to either wander alone or be taken around with a guide for an hour or so first. We felt that the tour was an excellent way to see Tuscany in a short trip and would have cost 45 euros each if we had booked it independently. It's really undersold on the hotel's website as it's new but if you have a Monday or a Wednesday to spare and are going for at least 4 nights it is definitely worth considering.So it all worked out really well and we would definately recommend Hotel Perseo if you want value for money in this very expensive city, friendly service and a clean modern environment.

<Content>Great hotel in Florence The Hotel Perseo is a great find in Florence.It's very conveniently located for sightseeing and getting to the train station.The hotel is clean and tidy and the rooms are spacious.I have stayed at this hotel twice now and both times all the staff members have been extremely friendly and helpful.Chiara and Tani, in particular, were so helpful before and during our stay. They offered advice about museum reservations via emails before we arrived and also prebooked tickets for us, which saved us queuing.I would not hesitate to book this hotel again and hope to return next year sometime.

<Content>Friendly helpful management Giacinto, the owner, manager, was extremely helpful during our entire stay. He helped us make last minute adjustments in how many were staying in the room. He gave us clear directions to get to the hotel. He made us feel welcome and comfortable during our stay. He directed us to places to see in Florence, and answered any questions we had. We loved the hotel.

<Content>so close to everything wow! this great little hotel is so close to everything!!! so close to the duomo we even heard mass there every 8am. it's actually centally located so you can actually walk to every place a tourist would want to go to.but the location of the hotel is just the beginning. the hotel itself and it's staff would make you feel close to home. they would give you a sort of introductory talk about florence... they shared some stuff i wouldn't want to share here as to let those things remain off the beaten track.we got the suite room which was fantastic! once in the room there was the welcome champagne and a box of chocolates... something i wou;d not really expect considering that the hotel does not charge so high.as a whole, our stay in florence was great. very, very relaxing.

<Content>sick in florence Florence was the last city in a two week vacation in Italy. The first night there, I became violently ill. If I had to be sick, I'm glad it was at this hotel. The rooms were very,very clean. the hotel staff was very helpful. They gave my husband trays with tea and rolls to help me get something in my stomach anytime he asked. The whole staff was very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Great little hotel This well maintained hotel is well positioned near the duomo, and a short walk from Florence SMN train station (the main station for Florence). The rooms are spotless and quiet and well proportioned, and the staff very helpful. We had excellent restaurant recommendations and they very kindly made some last minute museum ticket bookings for us as well (you really don't want to queue at the Uffizi or Accademia).For me, the only downside was that their coffee was a little watery, but my dad, who prefers a weak flat white made with instant coffee (his taste in coffee is truly awful), thought it was the best he had in Italy :-) The bar also offers very good value drinks.The internet access was also very good, and free!I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone visiting Florence.

<Content>Go to Il Perseo while you can still get in! It is against my best interests to write a review about Il Perseo, as I'm afraid they'll get even more well-known and ordinary people won't be able to get a room!A friend recommended Il Perseo to us. It is central (you can look down the street and see the Duomo), has an elevator (becomes increasingly impressive after a few weeks in Italy), nice people, modern bathrooms and good rooms.My husband left clothes in a closet at our previous hotel. Although I speak a little Italian, this seemed beyond me to arrange; the people at Il Perseo called the first hotel and arranged with them to have it shipped to our next hotel.They also recommended great restaurants nearby, and a store to get my husband clothes to tide him over that wasn't expensive and was close by.You can't go wrong with Il Perseo!

<Content>Great little budget hotel in the heart of Florence. We stayed at Il Perseo for three nights last August and it was really good. The hotel is pretty basic (a 3rd floor) but immaculately clean and the rooms are very nice and well kept. Considering we were at the very heart of Florence (a 20 seconds walk to the Duomo, literally) I could say the price was really reasonable (and as we were spending 3 nights there we had a discount rate). The staff was really nice and helpful and they offer a free glass of wine between 6 and 7 or 8, I can鈥檛 remember exactly. There鈥檚 no problem if you are arriving by car. Ask at reception and they鈥檒l arrange a parking solution for you. There鈥檚 a private parking nearby and they come and collect the car and they bring it back when you鈥檙e leaving. It鈥檚 rather expensive, though, 24 euros a day, but you don鈥檛 really have much choice.The only but is that the breakfast room is very small and it gets crowded in the morning so you鈥檒l probably have to wait for other people to finish their breakfast before you can have a seat.

<Content>Nice people, nice location, nice hotel My wife and I stayed at Il Perseo for four nights in September 2008.We had a great time. The hotel is not posh but it is excellent.It is very clean. It cannot be located better than it is for the needs of a tourist in Florence. It's a bit unusual in that you reach the reception area by riding in an elevator of a building the hotel shares with offices and, I assume, private apartments.The breakfast is modest but nice, the prices at the bar are quite low. There's wireless internet -- though it seems to be working only in the public areas (which was not a problem for us, actually).The main attraction, though, is the personnel. They were excellent: helpful, patient and cheerful in a thoroughly sincere way. Our questions were always answered promptly and requests seen to efficiently and without much ado. Moreover, all this was done without making us feel that we are intruding or bothering (I know, I know, this is supposed to be the norm everywhere but those of you who have traveled enough will immediately recognize that this nice attitude is not entirely common). We dealt mainly with Laura at the reception desk. But other people were as helpful, even though their English was not necessarily as good. Thanks, Il Perseo. Will try to get back soon.

<Content>STILL GOOD HOTEL I have stayed at this hotel three times this year on business and found the location, staff helpfulness and cleanliness to be excellent.Each time I have had an inside room, therefore no traffic noise - the hotel is located on a busy street.Pros:Very clean and fair sized roomThe Owners are unbelievable in every way possibleQuiet roomExcellent locationFriendly and helpful staff in generalFree laptop available on requestCons:No minibar/fridge - really essential during the heat of JunePrefer carpeting on floor of bedrooms rather than tiles (very personal opinion)Tiny shower with weak water pressure Small breakfast room with tiny tablesSmell of cigarette smoke from other rooms (not sure how to stop this)The cons are really minor except for the fridge which would be helpful all year around, not only in the heat of summer.This is a great hotel for tourists due to the location and helpfulness of staff.

<Content>A Pleasant Experience My 2 friends and I chose this hotel based from its positive reviews and these reviews were not wrong. The hotel was centrally located, just a stone's throw away from Duomo. It is also a walking distance away from the train station.The owners were very personable. They were always present and available to lend a hand. We have received innumerable valuable tips and suggestions from them. The rest of the hotel staffs were equally accomodating as well. The room was well-appointed and clean. It was big enough for the 3 of us.I highly recommend this hotel. You won't be sorry....

<Content>Convenient Refuge Ideal location to train station and Duomo. Room totally refurbished in January 2008. Clean, quiet, good value. Friendly receptionists speak English and go second mile to assist tourists. After a one week stay, we felt like family. Easy walk from hotel to all major tourist attractions.

<Content>Loved Hotel ll Perseo I stayed at this Hotel for four nights during a trip to Italy. I stayed from the 24/8/08 to 28/8/08.It was the best of the three star hotels I stayed in during our Holiday. Room was spacious, comfortable and quite. It had a very good shower room and it was cleaned daily. Breakfast was also adequate and good but the personal attention and welcome makes this hotel very special.We were assisted with train timables and restaurants were recommended. Nothing was too much trouble for the gracious owners.Hotel is very near the Duomo which makes it very centraland it is also convenient to the railway station which is about ten minutes walk away.

<Content>Location, Location, Location The hotel is near the Duomo in the centre of Florence. All the sights are in walking distance and most are within 15 minutes walk including all the major galleries and museums. The hotel is also close to the railway station (about 5 minutes walk) which was useful as we arrived by train.The hotel is clean and modern. The hotel staff are helpful and happy to assist with any problems or questions.Breakfast was basic but there was plenty of choice.

<Content>Loved La Decima Musa We stayed Il Perseo (which is also awesome) and we were looking for really quality place to eat in walking distance as I was traveling with my wife, mother and my mom-in-law, so needed to impress. We were given the recommendation to head here. It is great! The food is fantastic and the service is top notch. The owner tends to customers making you feel like you are his only guest for the evening, even though there may other sharing in this eating experience and that is exactly what it is! A great experience. You are greeted with a pre-dinner drink and a starter of the day (always tasty and exciting to see what comes out). We ate at another place (touristy) and tried to branch out to branch out to another, but nothing compared to what we ate here and nothing compared to the service, so we went back AGAIN!!! It was completely different menu and just as tasty! This is an absolute must as when you meet the owner, you will want to support his taste in cuisine and aid in his success as he was one of the nicest and personable people we met in our travels!

<Content>incredible little hotel Hotel Il Perseo is in the perfect central location in Florence. We were given a family room on the 5th floor and it was spacious, clean and it had incredible views of the duomo and the rooftops. Laura was wonderful at the front desk -- so helpful and accommodating. I would recommed this hotel to anyone who is going to Florence. It was a wonderful experience at a very reasonable price. Contact the hotel directly on their website and they'll give you the best rates and service.

<Content>Fantastic We had a wonderful stay. Staff were really friendly, literally couldn't do enough for you. Location was brilliant close to all main attractions. Room was lovely! A good size, nicely decorated, super A/C and really clean. Breakfast was perfect. The rate was also brilliant - it really felt good value for money. Other reviews have mentioned that the entrance is a bit unusual (the hotel begins on the 3 floor) however it was not a problem. I don't like lifts and it was fine to use the stairs at this hotel - I mentioned it when booking and the staff were kind and put me on the lowest floor. Fantastic hotel will definitely go back!!!

<Content>Great hotel What a great hotel. Centrally located, close to the train and duomo. The staff was wonderful. They all spoke English and we got great assitance from them when needed. My wife and I really enjoyed our stay. The hotel, the rooms and the dining room were clean. The bathroom was spotless. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a central spot in Florence and resonably priced.

<Content>Very Nice Stay We stayed here for 2 nights in July 2008. We arrived and our room wasn't quite ready. They offered us a drink and that we could leave our luggage until is was ready. As we sat in the lobby and got our bearings and maps, our room was finally ready. Staff was very friendly and helpful with any questions you might have. The Happy Hour was nice. Free glass of wine. Very great location. Quiet, updated, nice sized room. Clean. Easy walk from train station. Also easy walk to everything in general. Never had a problem with the lift not working. The hotel does have an easy to see sign next to the door and above the door as well. I had read on here that is was tough to find. I don't think that's the case anymore. You have to leave your room key with them everytime you leave. Then when you show back up you stop and the desk and get your key again. Not sure why. Maybe security reasons but it wasn't a big deal. All in all, we would recommend this place and stay here again in a heart beat. Enjoy!

<Content>Perfect Perseo The Hotel Perseo is a real treasure in Florence. It is about one block from the Duomo. The rooms are clean with very nice bathrooms. We had breakfast each morning and a happytime each afternoon. Giacinto, Louise and Tani were very welcoming and helpful with reservations and great directions!It was very, very hot when we were there but the airconditioning in the hotel was outstanding!Do not be put off by the entrance to the building. Once you get to the hotel you will be happy you chose the Perseo.Jan and Scott Lundal Schaumburg, IL

<Content>Great Location You would be hard pressed to find a hotel with a better location than this. You step out the door and 50 metres to your right is the Duomo . The rooms are very clean with a modern bathroom, the breakfast was adequate and the staff friendly. The only drawback is the size of the public areas which are very small,but as the hotel was used as a base, this wasn't a problem. If location means everything to you, this is the place to stay.

<Content>convenient location Excellent location on a main street, close enough to allow an easy walk from the train station, yet also close to city center, shopping and dining. A small, comfortable hotel with an updated, modern interior (except for the tiny, old-fashioned elevator). Our room faced into an interior courtyard, so there was no problem with noise from the street. Friendly staff, and our room felt luxurious for the price. Clean, comfortable, and attractive. We appreciated being able to use their computer to check email, and the nice little bar/cafe in the hotel was intimate and cozy. Breakfast was a little better than what you normally get in Italy hotels. Would definitely go back for another stay.

<Content>Great value - better location! We stayed at Hotel Perseo for two nights in May 2008. The hotel is so close to the Duomo and the train station, which makes it easy to walk out and see to the sights within minutes. The staff was very accommodating and made us dinner reservations both nights. The room was very clean with basic amenities, and a tad small, but we were in Firenze to see the city, not stay in our hotel room. The value was excellent for the location and cleanliness. Breakfast was about average compared to other places we stayed - nothing special. Yes, the bathroom and shower are small, but this is Europe and not a Hilton in America!

<Content>Great Location The most obvious asset of this hotel is it's location. The entire city of Florence is easily accessible and the area felt safe at all times of day (although the daytime did have a lot of heavy traffic).Similar to other reviews, I was surprised at first by the shabby entrance. Once I made it past that, however, I was delighted at how clean and modern the rooms were. The room was a good size, and the view outside our window was nice.Some little things at this hotel made it feel a little odd (i.e. there were no information sheets in the room telling you about breakfast, or how to even use the room phone), but the front desk staff was so incredibly helpful that it made up for it. Whether it was making restaurnat reservations or finding things to do, they were always eager to help out. The Aussie woman that works during the day (I think she may be the owner) was amazing! She was so helpful, and really cared that we enjoyed our stay. She is an expert of all things Florence, and can really help give some guidance on things.Overall, this hotel was a great value and the location was unbeatable. I would definitely stay there on a future visit to Florence.

<Content>Perseo lived up to our expectations We stayed at the Perseo for 4 days this month. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again. Florence is a very beautiful but crowded city. The Perseo provided a friendly, comfortable, clean and quiet retreat. The staff is outstanding, breakfast was delicious and you can't find a better location. We arrived at the train station, walked straight down the street for no more than 10 minutes and we were at the hotel. All the sights we wanted to see were nearby. I also appreciated that the staff made all the reservations for us at the museums. It was great to have free internet available so we could read and send emails.I commend the management and staff for being such good hosts.

<Content>First Class Stayed 5 nights at Hotel Perseo. Centrally located, 2 minute walk to Duomo. Restaurants, Shopping, Transport all close.Room was excellent, ensuite beautifully clean and towels plentiful. Breakfast was excellent, staff extremely helpful and attentive. Only gripe : there is no bar fridge in the rooms. So, cannot chill your wine or softdrink or water etc. Very annoying.Good base to travel to Siena, San Giminano and through Tuscany. Hotel Staff organised a wine tour and Siena tour as well as tickets to Academia and Uffizi Gallery so there was no waiting.

<Content>Great Location! I'll be honest that it took me a day or two to like this hotel. It is a fairly simple walk from the train station. However, for some reason, something about the reviews on here left me with the impression that the hotel was on a pedestrian street. So I was first a little disconcerted that the hotel is right on the really busy street leading up to the Duomo. I knew from the reviews here to expect a dodgy looking entrance - and it was definitely dodgy! And I, personally, would not have painted the entrance/breakfast room such a loud shade of orange - very picky thing, I know, but it just contributed to a less than elegant first impression. However, our stay was definitely lovely. Our room faced the back somewhere and had a tiny balcony. Even with the 'patio doors' open we could hardly hear the street noise - I could hardly believe it. The room was spotless - I'm picky and in my initial state of not being overly comfortable I did actually try to find evidence to support my discomfort and I couldn't. The bathroom was roomy and very clean. There was room for toiletries even! My husband loved it and was a little exasperated with me for being so picky. And I have to admit that he was right, it was a great choice. The location is amazing - 1/2 a block down from the baptistry. It was great to be able to return to the hotel during the day. Agree that the folks working there are very friendly and helpful and the free internet/laptop station was a great bonus. I booked directly with the hotel and they were kind enough to email and ask if they could book any reservations for us. Breakfast was more than adequate and it was nice to have cappucino/espresso included with breakfast. I would definitely stay here again and would definitely recommend it. I, personally, prefer a little more character in the style of a Residenza/Pensione so I would probably try to find something like that the next time - but if I wasn't able to or couldn't find the right price range I would definitely book this hotel again.

<Content>Wonderful Stay My boyfriend and i stayed at Hotel Il Perseo for 3 nights in May of this year. We had a great experience. We cannot stress enough the helpfulness of the staff; they really made some wonderful dining recommendations! They were all very willing to answer any of our questions; we were so impressed...and comforted...by their wilingness to accomodate all of our needs. The hotel itself is cute-modern. The 'Happy Drink', as they called it (re:Happy Hour) was a nice touch; we enjoyed sipping wine and nibbling munchies before our evening festivities each night! The rooms were average size, quiet, and exceptionally clean, which always is of utmost importance to any traveller. The bathrooms were nice, modern;...the only complaint is the low pressure shower stream. But it wasnt too bothersome. The location was the best feature of all....ridiculously close to the Duomo and other very important sights; as well as very close to the train station. Everything within close, wonderfully scenic walking distance. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone planning on staying in Florence. I'm so glad I followed the advice of other TA travellers and stayed at Hotel Perseo!

<Content>Excellent Hotel - Great Location - Extremely Helpful Staff I stayed with my partner for three nights at the start of June.From booking through till departing the hotel staff were so helpful and accomodating. From arranging drinks in our room when we arrived as it was my boyfriends birthday, to allowing us to have our breakfast late as we didn't get up early enough, to booking museums and recommending a wonderful restuarant for dinner one evening.The rooms are perfectly adequate. Big enough, lovely big comfortable bed, clean bathroom with a large shower, air conditioning. Plently of hangers in the wardrobe. Cleaned daily.The hotel location is brilliant - walk out of the hotel exit - turn right and within 30 seconds you are at the Duomo. Turn left and within 5 minutes you are at the station. I really cannot find fault with this hotel. If I return to Florence I would book this hotel again.

<Content>Great Hotel in Florence We spent 4 nights in Florence at Hotel Perseo. It's always a risk booking something online but Perseo is deserving of its high ratings.The location is spectacular, you can walk out the front door and the Duomo is right there. In a matter of steps you can be in any of the main piazzas, best streets or attractions. The rooms are basic but modern, clean, comfortable, and incredibly quiet (sound-proof windows?). Whoever did the reno did a superb job. Our room had the largest bathroom that we found in our entire trip in Italy. The staff were so friendly and helpful. Laura gave incredible restaurant recommendations. When we go back to Florence, we'll go to Perseo for sure.Highly recommended.

<Content>Great hotel -- very centrally located Great stay at Hotel Perseo recently. This hotel is very centrally located in Florence, which was key for us as I have a bad knee. Literally a 2 min walk to the Duomo and 12 min to both the Accademia (where the David is located) and also Piazza della Signoria (my favorite Piazza in Florence where copies of several famous statues stand). Piazza della Signoria is also where the Uffizi is located.The hotel has been renovated recently, so everything is new and clean. Nothing especially fancy, but still nice. It is located on the 3rd and 4th floors of a building (with lift). The entrance looks dumpy, but once you get to the 3rd floor it's been renovated.The thing that impressed me most about this hotel, was the front desk staff. They were extremely helpful and accomodating with every question I had and helped me out in many ways. They also made a booking for us at the Accademia and Uffizi in advance (which you must do at least a few weeks in advance of your stay). Definitely well worth it as you can't believe the waiting lines at these places. They also recommended a great restaurant for one of our evening meals, which both my daughter and I loved. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone.Only reason I wouldn't stay here is if I were looking for a luxury hotel.

<Content>Great hotel - Great staff! I stayed at this hotel with my girlfriend. We went on a two week trip and this was my favorite hotel. We stayed at more luxurious places (this place is standard, nice bed, ac, spotless bathroom), but the staff is great. They recommended some amazing restaurants and we had the best food of the whole trip in Florence. They also booked our museum reservations well in advance. I highly recommend Hotel Il Perseo.

<Content>Amazingly helpful staff Great location, comfortable rooms, friendly and it was cosy in winter. If you want people who go the extra mile for you then this is the place to stay. We decided to hire a car to drive around Tuscany, Laura spent a lot of time on the phone negotiating with car companies till she got us the cheapest price, then gave us great suggestions for a travel itinery. Nothing was too much trouble for the Il Perseo staff in terms of helpful suggestions to make sure you got the best out of your Tuscan stay. The small lounge is full of travel and tour guides with good Internet access. A friendly place to stay.

<Content>Perfect choice We have also recently returned from a wonderful three week trip to Italy. (Sorrento, Rome, Tuscany, Florence, Monterosso, Lake Como, and Venice) The Hotel Perseo was one of the friendliest places we stayed, helpful with all of our needs. It is perfectly located for attractions and shopping and afternoon naps. Free internet which happen to be down our second day. Highly recommend.

<Content>Great hotel, perfect location, friendly staff We have recently returned from a wonderful three week trip to Italy. The Hotel Perseo was perfectly located for attractions and shopping in the beautiful city of Florence. The staff were at all times personable and helpful which contributed to making our stay in Florence one of the highlights of our trip to Italy. A gluten free diet was required by one of us which proved no problem to the hotel, they provided specially labelled bread and cereal for breakfast and also advised (and booked for us) possible restaurants with gluten free options on the menu. When booking with Hotel Perseo advise of the need for a GF diet and they will help. We recommend Hotel Perseo's happy hour where great discussions took place along with a very enjoyable glass of wine and nibbles.:)

<Content>A Great Experience My wife and I had not been back to Italy since our honeymoon almost 19 years ago when we decided to take a vacation with our 14 year old daughter during her school break this past April. Our first stop was in Florence and the three days we spent there were just lovely.We found the Hotel Perseo to be excellent with updated rooms, and a modern bathroom. But besides those amenities the staff was just wonderful. Prior to our trip they booked museum reservations at the Uffizi and the Accademia for us and gave us advice on how best to get to the hotel. Laura and especially Tani were great and more than just a little helpful. Tani provided an excellent restaurant suggestion, La Decima Musa, which was probably the best dinner of our entire trip and the following evening was successful (after a number of attempts to get through to them by phone) in getting us a reservation at a particularly fine restaurant, La Giostra. Unfortunately, our daughter caught a 24 hour bug that day and we ended up not going that evening as we cared for her in our room. Tani was great as he cancelled our reservation, directed me to the closest all-night pharmacy (fortunately only a few blocks from the hotel) and suggested a restaurant that had full meals as takeout for my wife and myself so we could have something to eat (also not that easy to find in Florence outside of pizza). He went out of his way as he helped us deal with what was perhaps the most upsetting day of our trip.We would absolutely go back to the Hotel Perseo again鈥ot only for the location and the amenities, but because of the staff.

<Content>Great location and hospitality Wonderful place to stay. Felt welcomed immediately. The room was roomy, clean and had everything we wanted, including an in-room safe. Great breakfast and a free drink at happy hour after a day of touring. Right in the center of things. Couldn't have asked for a better place.

<Content>Perseo is great Have just returned from a five day visit with a friend. I cannot fault this hotel. It's location was ideal, being a few minutes walk from the Stazione and just steps from the Duomo. It was immaculate, beautifully appointed with good quality fittings and unfailingly clean. The breakfast was wonderful, fresh meat, cheese and crusty rolls with all the usual trimmings. The staff were brilliant. All were friendly, helpful and genuinely nice people. I have brought lots of their cards home to tell all my friends ! I will certainly return there.

<Content>An oasis in Florence The entrance to the building was not particularly inviting, but when you reach the 3rd floor and enter the stunningly bright entrance of this little gem, you find a great little hotel. I found it by accident and loved it. Our room was spacious, modern and quite luxurious for the price...I have stayed many times in Florence and found hotels that seemed OK on their websites to neglected and overpriced. Amazing value i think for the rating. At Perseo, attention to details made our stay a pleasant time. And it was so central and easy to get to from the station, but away from the market and seedy areas. And you can see the Duomo from there. Definitely will stay there again on my annual visit. My partner agrees and he is a fussy guy who basically hates most places he stays!

<Content>Enjoyable stay The hotel is strategically located, nearby Duomo, clean, and modern. The service is great, the staff (Tani, Badr, Laura, and Nick) and the host (Louise) are super friendly and attentive. They pre-booked museum entries, recommended good places to eat, and also recommended good ice cream places. The rooms, I stayed both in single room (8 nights) and double room (2 nights), are updated and quiet. The Internet is a big plus, and the happy hour with free two glasses of wine is another additional big plus. The ground level at first was a bit scary, and the elevator was interesting, but on the third floor, everything was updated. They said, it is common in Florence that hotels share the same building. The breakfast is adequate, warm pastries, cereals, bread, salami, fruits, and yogurts.The only drawback is the unstable temperature of running hot water in the morning during showers (in both rooms that I stayed), so the water temperature can suddenly get very hot in every half minute intervals, which was uncomfortable. But overall, I highly recommended this place because of its location and great service.

<Content>Great service, great price, great location After staying in Rome for 4 nights, we took the train to Firenze. What a difference. This hotel was within a 5 minute walk to 90% of the places we wanted to go to. NO TAXI's were needed. The rooms are very clean, modern and spacious (by European standards). I am typing this reviews from my room, on my laptop at high-speed. We are so close to the Duomo, that the bells wake us up at 7am every morning. No alarm clock needed. Soft beds, quite 23 hours and 55 minutes per day (the church bells around town go off a few times every day). No matter where you are in town, you will hear all the bells, I miss that back in the USA. The heated towel bar rack next to the shower was a surprising bonus.

<Content>A Secret Place in Florence! This hotel is a plum! From the street entrance you wouldn'trealize the delightful atmosphere inside and up the lift/stairway to the third floor.The staff and owners were exceptional hosts.The triple room we occupied was more spacious than many,has an updated bathroom, wireless internet connection, and flat panel TV (if you have time to spend in a room in such a glorious historical city). We heard no street noise and all slept well.This tidy hotel space is a nice retreat from the busyness of touring with the Happy Drink time from 6 to 8 PM. It is within walking distance of most major attractions, near the Duomo, the train station, shopping, a grocery store and an assortment of restaurants. Their breakfast offering was plenty...cereals, warm croissants/pastries, juices, milk, fresh fruit, coffee, tea and a friendly host/ess.We had a great time in Florence and would most definitelystay here again!

<Content>Great location! Stayed there by myself as my one splurge while traveling through europe on a students budget. Location: The hotel's situated halfway between the train station and the duomo- right in the center of florence. I was able to walk to every attraction no problem(luckily the weather was perfect when i was there so that helped too). The street the hotel was located on also was lined with shopping!Rooms: Very nice updated room. Small, but thats expected as this is technically a budget hotel. I had a small room with a queen bed and a small closet, small bathroom. All the linens were very nice, the room was very clean, water was hot, pressure good, etc. Had no complaints whatsoever. I booked a standard room that faced the street and when leaning out my window could see the duomo directly to the right.Other details: The hotel is difficult to find at first as it's not the entire building but just two floors. The breakfast was much better than any hostel breakfast i had, with fresh breakfast meats, fruit, delicious coffee, etc. The owners, or managers, were very nice, cordial, and made reservations for all the museums for me. Unfortunately I never made it to the free snack/wine in the afternoon.Also, I found the value to be great, i definitely would have spent more than i did for the room, location, and great service.

<Content>Wonderful location We just returned from a wonderful trip to Florence and couldn't have wished for a better hotel.Hotel Perseo is in a wonderful location around the corner from the Duomo, within 10 minutes walk of anything you might want to visit and is surrounded by lots of cafes and restaurants.We had read the trip advisor reviews about the hotel being hard to locate, so we knew what to look out for and found it easily.All the hotel staff were friendly and extremely helpful. Louise, Giacinto, Badr and Laura recommended restaurants, gave directions and made museum reservations. They also gave my husband and I a complimentary bottle of Champagne to celebrate our wedding anniversary.We had booked 2 rooms and had requested they be close together, for my husband and I and our two college age kids. The hotel gave us rooms next to one another on the 4th floor at the back of the hotel. We overlooked to rooftops of Florence and the rooms were very quiet.The hotel has been extensively renovated and the rooms and bathrooms are clean and bright. Bathrooms and showers were not huge but were more than adequate. Flat screen tvs in all rooms and free internet.Breakfast was included as was the afternoon Happy Drink which included snacks and a glass of wine. In addition, the bar is open 24 hours for coffee, sodas or a variety of different wines and other spirits. We will recommend this hotel to anyone we know who is planning to visit Florence and we would not stay anywhere else in Florence..

<Content>Highly recommended We stayed at Il Perseo from the 18 March to the 21 March. We found the hotel to be fantastic value for money. The location was in the center of all the attractions in Florence. It was clean, the staff were friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. The only reservation was that our room had a noise all night. It sounded like running water from the next room. This would be a concern if I were a light sleeper. With this in mind, I would not hesitate to book into Il Perseo if I found myself in Florence again.

<Content>Wonderful stay at the Il Perseo! My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Il Perseo! Louise went out of her way to help me out at the Pharmacy when I got ill on the trip. Without her help I don't know what I would've done. She saved my vacation. The hotel is in a great location right by the Duomo. Good restaurants nearby. The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was big by European standards. Breakfast was great. Lots of fresh fruit and great cappaucinos. I would definately recommend this to anyone looking for a nice hotel in Florence.

<Content>Can't say enough good things..... This place is amazing! The location is extremely close to the Duomo, which is the center of Florence. Beginning with check-in, we were more than pleased with our accomodations. Our room was a triple, with a king size bed and a semi-private alcove for our son in a single bed. His space had a window with a beautiful view of the Duomo. The bathroom was very spacious with a huge step in shower. The room was cleaned daily with fresh towels provided and absolutely immaculate at all times. The breakfast was great, with yogurt, fresh fruit, cereal and warm rolls and croissants. The cappuchinos were amazing! Best in Florence. Happy drink began at 6pm, and we found ourselves looking forward to going back, resting and going to Happy Drink! We met the nicest people from all over the world there. First glass of wine is free and a minimal charge for subsequent drinks. The staff was a wealth of information, advice and personality! The owners are onhand daily, and if time allows will sit and chat. They wil make restaurant recommendations and reservations, and any other reservations for museums etc. (Thanks Laura, Badr and Tarn) and of course Luisa!The location for this hotel is superb......walk to the Duomo, train station, markets and museums. We always felt safe and secure walking in the area and in the hotel itself. If you decide to stay at this hotel......you WILL NOT be disappointed! Enjoy!

<Content>Fabulously friendly My sister and I stayed at Il Perseo for 5 nights from the 9th of January. I had fortunately read the reviews on Tripadvisor so knew that the entrance to gain access to the hotel was not very well signed or attractive but that once you got to the thrid floor all would be well. My sister's reaction to the entrance was classic as I forgot to tell her but she was reassured when we go to the front desk!!!!! Il Pereo is fantastically located, exit the building, turn right and you can see the Duomo, and to reach it takes less than a couple of minutes, absolutely fantastic. The hotel itself is informal, nicely minimalistically decorated, very clean and while the bathroom was small it's not like you spend a large amount of time in one. If you are in Florence and want to spend lots of time in a bathroom then stop wasting your time and just go home. The beds were comfortable but the pillows a bit hard but that is just a personal thing. Breakfast was simple but good and the happy hour a nice way to end the day, before heading out for dinner later. We could buy large bottles of water at a very cheap price and fill the smaller ones we used during the day and you could get a good coffee and tea any time. The staff especially Lara were fantastic. They were helpful, with tips about restaurants, how to get to where you wanted to go, what to see or assisting with booking side trips. I would recommend this hotel. It is not luxurious nor is it a bland, everything is exactly the same as you find with chain hotels. It is good value, personal and friendly with a location you cannot really beat. Try it, I am sure you will like it.

<Content>Outstanding value We were extremely impressed with this hotel both for quality and value for money. The recently-refurbished rooms are excellent (great bathroom), the location is fantastic and the staff are delightful - Laura in particular gave us great advice for making the most of our three days in Firenze. Breakfast was a cut above the usual mid-range hotel breakfast in Italy and the free 'happy hour' drink in the evenings was much appreciated! I'd definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Florence, whether for a first visit or returning.

<Content>Hidden Gem Located on a major street near Duomo, a few blocks from central railroad station, this hotel is announced only by a small sign amidst shops and office buildings. A small elevator takes guests up to a third floor reception, lounge, and breakfast area. Hallways had yet to be renovated, but the rooms on the third and fourth floors have been and they were a most pleasant surprise...modern,well organized and beautifully decorated. The hotel is run mainly by Louise, originally from New Zealand, a dynamo who is warm, knowledgeable, and who directed us to excellent local restaurants that we would have never found on our own. We spent four nights at Il Perseo on this, our third visit to Florence. This was by far our best hotel experience for three reaons. One was the excellent location, the second was quiet. The combination of the two is hard to find in Florence. The third was Louise herself, who is a nonpareil host.

<Content>Great Location! Hotel Il Perseo was a great 3 star hotel. The rooms were newly renovated, so they were clean and spacious. It's a little bit of a strange set up - there's an elevator lift from the street level in the middle of the building but the check in desk is on the 3rd floor - hard to explain. You can't beat the location though - right next to The Duomo and a 5 minute walk from Santa Maria Novella - and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The price was great. We had just come from a 5 star hotel in Rome, so we noticed the amenities that were missing - a minibar in the room (we don't use them anyways), a shower with a tub (the shower was pretty small, but it was good enough), carpeted floor (the floor was tiled and could be a little cold). That being said - we would definitely stay here again. There was a free internet hook up in the room, easily controllable heat/air, flat screen TV, lots of room and a really comfy, big bed - the down comforter was awesome - not something you're likely to find in Italy, even in a 5 star hotel. The breakfast was pretty good - pastries, cereal, meat, yogurt, etc. I definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved This Hotel - - - Wonderful This hotel is FABULOUS. It is1 block from teh Duomo and very centrallylocated. Americans will first be surprised, OMG, what did I get into, as you transcend the rather down at the heel public elevator ofthe buidling. You step into a very simple but cheerful area and realize this is typical European. Then you truck down the hallway withthe wonderful person on duty and see what this charming owner-couple has down to this place. He, a charming architect, and she a very sharpAustralian/New Zealander. It is quite spiffy with wonderful amenties - - - like LARGE showers. You could have breakfast in it!!! Like a larger than normal room - - - about 15 x 18. This was a wonderful hotel. Everyone was charming. Damn, they ought to start a chain! Breakfast was more than adequate with 2 cereals, wonderful ham/pastrami and cheese, toast, fruit and yogurt. It is amazing how they have used the talents/knowledge to rehab this place - - - which is a NIGHTMARE in such an old city with various restrictions and building codes.A couple of notes: check out google for ALL hours of the museums. if you are watching you bucks, DO NOT DRINK COFFEE AT A TABLE - - - do it at the bar (tables are $3EURO more). Space is at a premium n Florence, this is standard. The one restaurant nearby (out the door, straight ahead down the alley/street, is Il Messo (The fools) - - not bad at all. For lunch, just grab a sandwich from teh vendors or find the side street where there are some Arabian eateries which make WONDERFUL sandwiches. ALSO, go UP TO the Michelangelo Park (across the river). Beautiful and see the PItti first - - - it is a 5 hour experience in history and gardens. If you go anywhere, go by train. WATCH the porters with your bags as they try to tell you $10 EURO perbag for carrying. Just look at the bottom of your ticket and see which train (done this a bit, just sharing). Enjoy the Perseo, no complaints. After Rome/Venice and Bologna, this room was a bowling alley in size.

<Content>Amazing hotel; felt high end! This hotel is just fantastic! Being Australian, it felt great to meet the owner who is also Australian. She was very helpful and gave great advice and restaurant suggestions. Her and her staff truly care about their guests and their breakfasts and happy hours were like social gatherings. We had trouble finding the place at first (turned down the wrong street), but I called the hotel and eventually found our way. The facade was being redone so it obscured the front of the building. Finally we saw the small sign for the hotel and went up the very reliable elevator to the 3rd floor. The reception was a great preview of what was to come. This hotel is very new and modern. It felt hip and cool even! They offered us coffee while we waited and then took us a floor up to our room at the back of the hotel. The viewwas okay but there was a lot of natural light and the room was just great. Everything felt new and was very, very modern. For the rate (off season), it was a great deal I think.The bed was good and the lounge bench to the side folds out to become a second bed. The bathroom was small, but perfectly fine. We liked theA/C-heating unit which can be controlled with a remote. The TV was a flatscreen and also good. The breakfast was really good actually, but I think the coffee out at cafes is better. The lounge area is cozy and they have all the good travel guides you can read up on. The laptop with free internet is also a nice touch, as is the free WiFi all around.The location was great. Only 5-8 minute walk from the train station, 2 minutes to the Duomo and it's really centrally located. The shoppingis on your doorsteps and the sights are only 5-10 minutes away. I really can't think of any downsides to the place. I recommend this hotel wholeheartedly and it's nice for a quiet romantic getaway!

<Content>A Great Base in Central Florence The first good thing about this hotel is the location. It's a few minutes from the train station and right in the middle of Florence - without being noisy or smelly. No more than 2-3 minutes from the Duomo and within walking distance of all the sights. We stayed for 5 nights. The first night in a large room overlooking the road - this had a lovely view but was a little noisy. The next 4 we spent in a room on the rear side of the hotel. This didn't have much of a view but had plenty of natural light and you did overlook some lovely old buildings. Both rooms were large amd stylishly furnished with excellent bathrooms and were extremely clean. There was a public computer in the reception area and internet was free in your room with a laptop. Every evening the hotel puts on a happy hour with the first drink free. This was a good way to mix with other guests if so inclined. Breakfast is buffet style with cereal, coffee/tea, cold meats, cheese etc. The food was fresh and plentiful.All of the staff were professional and friendly. One was of great help to me in working out where I could buy tickets for the Fiorentina game (Florence's Serie A soccer team). I wouldn't have managed this without their help. The husband/wife team were helpful and obviously work hard to provide a quality operation. I would have no hesitation in staying here again and would certainly recommend the hotel without reservation.

<Content>Hotel Perseo - Great value and location. I stayed here for 3 nights in October 2007 with my sister and brother-in-law. Booked a single room, but the room was a double for single use - I paid 97 Euro per night, which I thought was very reasonable. I think the only difference between my single room and my sister's room was that they had a better view. Rooms were clean, bed was comfortable, bathroom was good sized. My room was on the 4th floor looking over the street but the window did a good job of blocking out the noise. The location is wonderful - just a few steps from the Duomo, and about a 5 minute walk from the train station. It was a quick walk, but in hind sight we probably should have taken a cab - am betting it would have been cheap, and we had overpacked for our 3 week vacation so lugging the suitcases on crowded sidewalks probably wasn't worth what we saved by not getting a taxi. Plus, we had just come from Venice and dodging the traffic was a bit of a shock to our system at that point! But had I gone carry-on size, I wouldn't hesitate to walk it. Breakfast was good - buffet with fresh fruit, really good pastries, yogurt, the usual meats, cheeses, rolls. Freshly made capuccinos. Took advantage of their happy drink one evening too. A very nice touch. We took one of the staffs recommendations for lunch at a pizza place on one day - very good. My sister and brother-in-law took their recommendation for dinner one night and were very happy with that too. Probably the only drawback (if you can call it that) is that the entrance and the hallway aren't nearly as attractive as the hotel itself - since it occupies the 3rd and 4th floor in an apartment building. The owner told us they are going to be able to repaint the hallway between the 2 floors soon, so then once you get up to the property on the 3rd floor, and have to exit to go to a 4th floor room, you won't feel like you are going back into a dingy apartment building. But really, this isn't that big of a deal. Would stay here again!

<Content>Perfect stay at Perseo We stayed at Il Perseo at the end of our two week stay in Italy. While it was not Italian in decor it was such a great surprise. The hotel was recently renovated and everything is new in the rooms and bathrooms. I loved the soothing and modern color schemes. While it was the least expensive hotel we stayed in (140E/nt) it had the BEST beds. Very comfortable. Also great to have wireless internet in rooms and the flat screen with at least two english channels (BBC and CNN International) was so appreciated. The bathrooms are small, but they make the most of the room with decent shelf space and it is so clean. The internet pictures on hotel website are accurate.The owner is a delighful woman and everyone who worked there was very helpful and friendly. They made museum reservations for us through email before our arrival. The location down the street from the Duomo, as many have reported, is just the best. So convenient to everything. We never needed a cab. I'm almost afraid to give this such a glowing review, because when I first made our reservation about a year ago, this was a little known gem and now it is near the top of trip advisor and I'm guessing prices will rise. The ONLY problem we had was on arrival -- we had a rental car and thought we could drive up to hotel, unload our bags and then take car back. This was not possible; the street is so busy and no place to park, although our cab that brought us back just double parked and unloaded us, we just didn't have enough time to do that and check-in!

<Content>Absolutely brilliant choice Hotel Perseo Of the 6 hotels I had stayed in various cities during my 14-day trip in Italy, this has to be the best.The hotel is located right in the centre of activities, conveniently located near to the Duomo, central railway station and bus routes. Most of the tourist sites/museums are within walking distance.The rooms look new and recently refurbished, with tasteful furnishings and a homely feel. I especially liked the bathroom which is of sufficient size. The facility of free broadband internet connection for room guests with laptops is the cream of the cake. If you do not have a laptop, there is an internet station near the reception where you can use for free.The staff have been extremely friendly and helpful in providing info on tours in Florence, train timetable, where to dine etc. The husbandwife owner are equally warm and friendly. They must have treated their staff well for them to be so motivated and into the job. This is the most guest friendly hotel I had experienced in Italy. The breakfast has a variety of croissants and buns, cold cut meats, cereals etc. Breakfast is served in a cosy coffee room. Don't forget this is continental breakfast and so don't expect any hot food.If there is any downside comment I want to make, it is the hot water system in the shower which occasionally fluctuated in pressure i.e. a slight variation in temperature. But this is quite common in some hotels I had been to and is a minor problem.Will I ever return? Most definitely! I would strongly recommend this hotel to other travellers. It is good value for money!

<Content>Great choice in the heart of Florence This was a very nice hotel in the heart of Florence so we were able to walk from the train station to the hotel and from there, were able to walk everywhere in Florence.The rooms were larger than many we had in Italy and they were very clean and updated as well. Great staff, nice complimentary evening drinks, Internet access...This is a great value hotel and we would stay again.(Get good directions, can be easily missed at first... up 4 floors, but with an elevator or stairs).

<Content>Good choice, but nothing fancy Location is very convenient, but on a very busy street. We specifically requested a room away from the street which was quiet. I don't know if the rooms on the front side are loud or not.The rooms are clean and modern, with a flat screen television, but the finishes are pretty basic and unmemorable. The shower was very small.Service was excellent and very personal...they are truely there to help their guests.Convenient internet service and decent breakfast was a plus.

<Content>Great location  We booked this hotel because of the other reviews on Tripadviser and we were not disappointed in any way. Everything about the hotel lived up to the reviews and met our expectations. The staff were very friendly  helpful and none of our requests seemed too much trouble. The rooms are quite basic but give you everything you need for a city break and the location is ideal.Breakfast is a very simple affair but could not be faulted. Having had breakfast in 2 other hotels during our 2 week trip, this was by far the best. The food was fresh, plentiful and served with a smile.Happy hour, with a free glass of wine and snacks, sums up the view of the hotel, that they are there to provide a home from home for their guests.All in all would highly recommend and would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Great Property! What a wonderfully delightful hotel in the heart of Florence. Easy walk from the train station, the hotel is perfectly situated to enjoy the pedestrian character of Florence.The hotel is updated, clean, quiet despite the location and the staff is a real joy. Breakfast was well appointed and the afternoon wine hour was not to be missed for meeting up with fellow travelers.Staff will make reservations for Accademia and Uffizi, tours and give the best advice on travel and restaurants. In fact, each of the staff have different restaurant favorites and its nice to try several.Would not consider staying anywhere else. This is a comfortable and convenient hotel.

<Content>Location, location, location This hotel is is 50 meters from the Duomo and that is its best recommendation. When other reviewers say the front is not well marked they weren't kidding. We stood on the street outside the hotel and had to call the hotel to find out where it was. There is literally no signage. The hotel is clean and the front desk help is great. We made the reservation through venere.com and then through direct contact with the hotel Laura made reservations for us at the Ufizi and the Academia museums. Everyone there was very nice. We had one flight of stairs to the fifth floor as the elevator only goes to the fourth. The a/c worked great and the room was ok for a triple. It really is just a 3 star hotel and I wouldn't rate it any better. There is a nice breakfast and wine in the evening, but it's all pretty basic.

<Content>Great location and value My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 days during the middle of a 2 week trip to Italy. Thankfully we read other reviews and were able to locate the hotel which is on the third floor of an apartment building. The room was lovely with a view of the rooftops and recently updated. The location was excellent just steps from the Duomo. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. What was very nice is that there was a laptop we could use in the public area. There also was a bar/breakfast area with a happy drink hour in the evenings. We met several repeat guests who described feeling like this was their second home. We would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location, fantastic staff My husband and I stayed here in early September and had a great time. The location was perfect for sightseeing and was right in the middle of things. We had taken the train from Venice and had no problems finding the hotel from the station. The Duomo is literally around the corner (and you'll hear the bells in the morning!). The staff was very courteous and helpful and spoke perfect English, which was key since it seemed like most of the guests were American or British. The breakfast was pretty standard for Italy - rolls, pastries, cereal and cold cuts. The complimentary evening glass of wine and snacks offered a nice respite from all the walking during the day. Altogether, Il Perseo is very enjoyable hotel for a great price.

<Content>Perfect hotel in Florence We had a fabulous 2 night stay in August 2007 at the Hotel Perseo. I had booked directly with the hotel and received prompt and helfpul responses to my emails. They even offered to pre-book our visit to the Uffizi gallery (which just so happened the day that the staff of the Uffizi had a 'staff meeting' read 'strike' and the pre-booking didn't avoid the queues for us in the end - this of course is no reflection on the hotel but more the way of life in Italy).Location is brilliant: just a few blocks to the main train station and a few steps to Piazza San Giovanni where the Baptristry and Duomo Cathedral are. It is the perfect location for getting around on foot and nothing is too far from this property. Florence is a wonderful old city and fun to just get lost in the beautiful old streets.The staff were lovely and the gentleman that checked us in offered us a cappacino while we waited the few minutes for our room to be ready. He also showed us to our room (carried a suit case) and explained how the lights/air cond worked. Very friendly and helpful later when we asked for suggestions for reasonably priced restaurants for dinner and best area to buy leather.The room we had was large, very modern, clean and simply lovely. It had been recently renovated and this showed - it contained a safe, flat screen TV, large queen (comfortable but firm) bed and tastefully decorated (in natural colours) bathroom which contained shower, toilet, bidet, hair drier and hand basin (see photos). We were fortunate enough to have a room at the back of the hotel which was nice and quiet. We had the pleasure of hearing the bells from the Duomo toll every now and then and this only added to the atmosphere. The breakfast (included in the price) included fruit, pastries, freshly made coffee of your choice, yoghurt, cereals etc. Overall, the property was very good value for money and I would certainly recommend it and would most certainly go back to stay there.

<Content>Could not pick one fault with this lovely hotel!! I have just returned form a 3 night break in Florence with 2 girlfriends. We stayed at the Perseo and i can honestly say it was the perfect hotel. Its only small but the owner cannot do enough for you. She reserved museums for us and told us the best places to eat in the city. From the outside the hotel looks a little dated but once inside its more like a 4 star boutique hotel. The breakfast is lovely with the most wonderful coffee and pastries. Our hotel room was large and modern with a flat screen tv, a fab bathroom and 3 single beds. It was the ckeanest room i have ever stayed in and the view was lovely of the old bells. The location is perhaps the best in florence. I give this hotel 10 out of 10 and cannot wait to return very soon. I would not consider staying anywhere else in Florence!!!!

<Content>Great location, decent room Maybe we're too picky, but we found this hotel just average, not great, not terrible. First, the location is excellent - so close to all the sights, but what sort of disappointed us was the room. Yes, it's renovated, but it has a very cold feel to it - tiled floor, and very basic furnishings. The shower (no tub) is tiny and the whole room feels hospital-like in a way. After a day of seeing Florence, with all of its art, history, character and beauty, it was a bit strange to come back to such a stale looking room. I guess for 140 euro a night, we were expecting a bit more when it came to the room. That being said, the staff is VERY friendly; they do go out of their way for you and the hotel has more of an intimate feel to it than any other we've stayed at.I think if we ever go back to Florence though, we'd chose a cozier, more high end hotel with nicer rooms.

<Content>One of the best hotels in Europe! Excellent hotel in Florence!!! We stayed for only one night while traveling through Switzerland and Italy, but this was by far one of the best hotels. The staff were so friendly and helpful - we forgot to book a reservation for the Ufizi in advance so asked about it when we checked in and they were able to squeeze us in the next morning before we left. The location is terrific - on the same street as the Duomo. Our room had a little balcony overlooking the rooftops in Florence. The breakfast was really good - great yogurt and cappucinos and pastries and juices. The bathrooms were immaculate (hard to find in such an old city!) and the bed was pretty comfortable. The entrance is a bit odd and not too well labeled that you have to go up to the third floor, but once you figure it out, it is great. My only recommendation is not to ever drive in Florence - it was a nightmare nagivating through the tiny one-way streets (many of which you're not even really allowed to drive on except getting to a hotel) with all the tourists in the middle of summer. We got lost for over an hour, knowing pretty much where the hotel was, but getting continuously directed away from it by the one way streets. Anyhow, once we finally found it, the hotel called the garage and someone came right away to take the car away - and it was only 21 euros - which felt like the best deal in the world to get rid of the car and have it brought back the next morning. All in all, a really excellent hotel with exceptional staff and a really great price (~$170 in the highest tourist season, w/breakfast) for such a nice room and amazing location.

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel was great! The rooms were minimalistic, but they provided enough space for my husband and myself. The location is convenient from the train station and to all the major sights. We did the Walking Tours of Florence 1 day package, and it was excellent. The hotel is very close to the tour office. We didn't realize that there are NO clocks in any of the hotel rooms in Italy, so don't forget to bring one.

<Content>great base in Tuscany with helpful staff We stayed here late June for 4 nights that we prebooked on Perseo's website. Even in the booking confirmation email the staff was very helpful and offered to assist with reservations for museums, etc. - we had them reserve the Uffizi for us, which made the process of getting in to see the museum quick and painless, avoiding needless waiting in line. Laura and Stefania were both most helpful in making sure that our stay in Florence was a great experience. The rooms are modern and clean. Our nephew still says that Anna in the breakfast room makes the best hot chocolate anywhere!After 4 nights, we sadly left and moved on to our next destination. After checking into our next terrible hotel we immediately called Perseo to see if we could come back the next night. Stefania immediately reserved a room for us and we were welcomed back early the next morning as if we were family by Laura and were given our same room again. We will have very warm memories of Laura, Stefania, and Anna and their colleagues and would not hesitate to return to stay with them again or to recommend this hotel to friends.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We (4 of us) stayed at this wonderful hotel from 3 to 6th July 2007 - as far as we are concerned, it cannot be faulted! Tripadvisor has served us well yet again :-)Louise, the Kiwi-Aussie owner, is a brilliant hostess, and her staff were just as wonderful. The rooms were light and airy, with icy-cold airconditioning (which was appreciated after a day walking around in the heat!). The bed was comfortable and the shower hot. Whilst the rooms are quite small, they are beautifully finished and very clean. Breakfast and Happy Drinks were well above our expectations - delicious bread and hot chocolate, and a pre-dinner wine each night was a real treat.Another huge plus for the hotel is the location - 3 minutes to the Duomo, and 10 minutes to anything you could hope to get to. Getting to pop home during the middle of the day for a quick recharge was fantastic, and meant that we had more energy to keep sightseeing!!Thank you to Louise and her staff for making our first (but not last) trip to Florence so enjoyable.

<Content>Fantastic Location We booked this hotel because of its location and proximity to the tourist areas, and we were not disappointed. When you walk out of the building and look to your right, the Duomo is right there. The hotel has been recently redone. The hallways are bright and airy. The room and bathroom were very clean. The air conditioner worked great. My one complaint with the room is that there are no drawers or shelves, so you can not unpack and have to live out of your suitcase. The continental breakfast was great and the cappucinos were wonderful. The staff at this hotel was the nicest we encountered.After having said all this, there is something I feel I must add. When we first arrived at the hotel, I was disappointed. The hotel is not on the ground level, but on the third and fourth floors. The entrance into the building is not attractive, the tiny elevator felt claustrophobic, and the stairs were dark. But, once you get upstairs, everything is fine.

<Content>Very convenient for Florence weekend I recently spent the weekend in Florence with my wife. We chose the hotel as we always do, based on tripadvisor comments. Overall the experience was a positive one and I'd certainly recommend the hotel. In summary:Positives1. Location ... perfect location! 30seconds from the Duomo, minutes from the main shopping area and 10-15 minutes from almost all historic attractions. Florence is a small central city and so taxi's were not needed the entire weekend (except to/from the airport).2. Management ... very welcoming (before and during arrival). We had to cut our stay short by 1 day due and while their policy is 72hrs notice, they were kind enough to accept 48hrs notice.3. Clean ... rooms, while simple, were a good size and clean. When we asked for additional towels, they arrived quickly (I also cut myself shaving, next morning new sheets were changed without request).4. Breakfast ... again simple (no warm food), but more than adequate with cereal, yogurt, breads, etc. Included in the price and great capaccino and hot cholocate included.Negatives1. On first sight, can be mistaken as an upgraded youth hostel ... to enter you have to climb 3 floors of stairs or use the small elevator available. The reception is basic and no assistance is available with bags, etc (not that any was needed for a weekend stay). Our room was on the 4th floor which could be accessed by anyone by simply using the public stairs/elevator.2. Internet was down, although this is due to the service provider versus the hotel. Minor complaint against all the positives.Overall a convenient, clean and welcoming hotel that provides reasonable cost in a great location. Certainly would use it again.

<Content>Enjoyed our Stay at Perseo Spent four nights at Hotel Il Perseo. The staff was great and spoke multiple languages. The breakfast was o.k., but more hearty than the usual Italian pastries.The hotel is quite modern and our room was clean, quiet, and spacious. The beds were a bit soft, but not intolerable. The bathroom was quite big but the water pressure was inconsistent.The location was fabulous, within walking distance of Duomo and the train station.

<Content>Cozy, Well located We stayed 4 nights here. It was a contemporary, small boutique hotel within walking distance of everything. The accomodations were comfortable, breakfast was simple, but lovely, free internet, and free happy drink every afternoon. Their dining/bar area was a great way to meet other guests. Dave and Laura were wonderful with helping to acclimate us. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Great hotel, lovely staff, very convenient to all attractions My boyfriend and I were in Florence for one night only and stayed in Hotel Il Perseo which is very conveniently located. Within walking distance from the train station, the Duomo, Accademia, Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio, basically everything. Laura was unbelievably helpful, booking reservations for us (in advance and even in other cities!), searching for trains, etc. The hotel itself is very clean, well appointed and rooms/bathrooms quite large for Europe. Plus, the price was right and breakfast was included. I would absolutely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Perseo We stayed 3 nights in Hotel Perseo in a quad room. The room was comfortable, very modern and clean. The bathroom was clean. The hotel is in the center of Florence, in walking distance to everything. The rate included breakfast and free internet in the lobby. I booked this hotel based on the tripadvisor reviews. I was not disappointed. I read about Laura and everyone was right, she is a great asset to the hotel. She is very helpful and friendly. She made you feel at home. The hotel does have a small elevator. Overall it is a great hotel and very comfortable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to be in the center of Florence.

<Content>A great small hotel in a wonderful city! My family and I (five of us) stayed in three rooms at the Hotel Il Perseo from July 1 to the 7th and really enjoyed our stay in Florence. I had researched the hotels in Florence on Trip Advisor and found the reviews very positive. The rooms are comfortable, fully air conditioned, and very, very convenient to all of the museums and sights in Florence. It's easy to pop back into the hotel to rest a bit before venturing further. Florence is definitely a walking city and easy to get almost everywhere.The breakfast was good---wonderful rolls and coffee (in fact, some of the best coffee I've had); and the happy drink time in the evening was a great way to wind down before searching for a restaurant for dinner. The elevator is a quick way to get up to the 3rd and 4th floors where our rooms were located, but my son and daughter regularly climbed the stairs each time!! We will definitely stay in the Hotel Perseo again when returning to Florence!J.S., Texas

<Content>We wouldn't consider staying anywhere else! We could not have been happier with the Perseo. The location was perfect, our family room was spacious, very well appointed and bright, with a wonderful view over the rooftops and bell towers of Florence, and our hosts were generous and extremely knowledgable.

<Content>Fully recommend Fantastic location, friendly staff, recently renovated rooms, great bathroom, clean housekeeping.Of course, the lift is small and rooms hardly king-size. But that's more to do with how accommodations are in Italy in general. So no complains from me!

<Content>Great location Pros:- great location, near train station, in the middle of the city and all tourist sites are easily accessible on foot- felt safe, as hotel is on major road leading to Duomo- clean and modern rooms- very friendly staff- had English TV channels (BBC, CNN)Cons (minor):- usually only one person is staffed at the reception, so can be disorganized when busy- shower was weak in our room- elevator to the 3rd floor where hotel is located is quite smallOverall, this is a great smaller size hotel that provides great value for money.

<Content>Not a 3 star - more a 1 star Not really sure how this can be so highly ranked on this website. This is simply not a 3 star hotel. It has more of a 3 star hostel feel. Yes - the staff is very friendly - and they have a computer for internet access, and the location is good- but that is about where the truth ends. The rooms are only somehwat clean - my mattress for the bed was terrible, the entrance is to a rental apartment and you more than expact a bum to be sleeping in the corner. Once you get to the 3rd floor there is more of a counter than an actual lobby. My wife asked for a bed board because the beds were very soft and by the look of the staff, you could tell that they did not even know what we were asking for. There seem to be so many hotels in the area - so I think you can do better.

<Content>BEST OF FLORENCE Hotel Perseo is the best place to stay while visiting Florence. This was our 2nd visit to Florence in 2 years , both times we have stayed at Hotel Perseo. The hotel has had a superb upgrade, with virtually everything new, great colour schemes, friendly, helpful english speaking staff and proprietors. Hotel Perseo is comfortable, clean and very central to all the sights for tourists, whatever their length of stay. I highly recommend this hotel and have enjoyed advising anyone visiting Florence to make use of this well sited relaxed hotel. As New Zealanders we enjoyed the complimentary breakfast, the chance to meet other travellers, discuss with people sights to see, talk with the hosts on ideas and plans for our visit and be able to book tours through these very helpful individuals. The rooms are superior and comfortable, bathrooms clean and everything accessible. My 16 year old daughter and I highly recommend Hotel Perseo as a fantastic place to stay.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location I used the Rough Guide for this hotel. I don't agree with their rating of a 1-star. This is at least a 2 to 3 star. The hotel was newly renovated, so that may be the issue. It is extremely clean, and very comfortable and very very reasonable. I had a room with a double bed, with a second bed, so 3 could stay very comfortably, and a very clean bathroom with shower. The location couldn't be better. Look left, the train station, look right, the Duomo. Very close to the nightlife. The hotel owners were a great resource for day trips and any other infomation. I highly recommend this hotel. Just so you know. I usually stay in 4 and 5 star hotels for work, so I am well versed in hotels. For the location, cleanliness and friendly service, you couldn't ask for better. I loved it!

<Content>Wonderful Experience We recently stayed in Hotel Perseo. Our room and bathroom (recently renovated) were spotless and comfortable. Just a block from the Duomo and within easy walking distance of other major sights, The Perseo 's convenient location made it easy to return to our room for a quick bathroom break or a short rest. The quiet, air conditioned room was always a welcome retreat at the end of the day. All the staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and very helpful. They made reservaions for museums, recommended restaurants, gave directions, and made sure we had a taxi for an early morning flight. We highly recommend the Perseo and will definitely stay there again when we visit Florence.LB Houston

<Content>Loved the Perseo Our experience at the Hotel Perseo was a warm and welcoming one. It is nicely located and the rooms are clean and cozy. Most importantly, the service was extremely accomodating. Everyone at the desk, particularly Laura worked hard to make our stay a wonderful one. When we encountered some difficulties with our flight back to the US, Laura spent over an hour making calls on our behalf to make things right for us. We will always be appreciative to her and to everyone at the Hotel Perseo for their warmth, kindness and helpfulness.

<Content>Location, location, location! Hotel Perseo in Florence is a great place to stay! We spent 24 days in Europe and stayed in ten different hotels. Hotel Perseo was our favorite. The staff was warm, friendly, and helpful. From the very first contact to the last, everything went smoothly and professionally with Hotel Perseo.We arrived in Florence before check in, but the room was ready. The room we stayed in - Room 409 - was spacious, comfortable, and had great air conditioning. The view from this room is very sweet - a small bell tower atop the church just down the corner toward the train station.The location was just terrific for us. It is just a short walk from the SMN train station. As you step out of the hotel doorway, you can look down the street and see the famous Duomo almost at your doorstep. It is close to all the sights of Florence and close to the train and bus stops for travel beyond the city.We plan to return to Florence, and when we do, we will book the Hotel Perseo's room 409 again.Bonnie and Paul CrabtreeMississippi - USA

<Content>Great location and service This is a very good hotel. Within walking distance of Florence's main attractions. The rooms are clean and newly renovated. The staff are very helpful and the breakfast is above average for an Italian hotel. The staff go out of their way to make recommendations for restaurants and places to visit in Tuscany.

<Content>Great hotel We booked this hotel on the basis of reviews on tripadvisor, and were not disappointed. Location is perfect, rooms are very nicely decorated, breakfast is very nice and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The free glass of wine in the evenings is a nice touch.This was my 3rd trip to Florence and the best hotel of the three. It was also the first hotel I've stayed in in Italy with proper towels!!

<Content>Fabulous!! When you've found the best why go with the rest? I found this hotel with Trip Advisor. We wanted a room for 4 people and we got more than what we expected. The hotel is 5 minutes away from the train station, just walk up the street toward the dome. We were literally a 2 minute walk from the dome and within a 15 minute walk of all the sites. You wouldn't believe how many times we were able to come back to the hotel to rest up before going out again. It's that close to everything. The hotel has a nice elevator and reception is on the third floor. As soon as you walk into reception you feel like you're home. It is so comfortable and relaxing with reception straight ahead, a lounge to its right with a large and long couch, books to read and magazines and newspapers and lots of brochures to help you out. They have a great map of Florence that they gave us and they mapped a great place to eat Za Za which is to die for. A great large tv in the lounge too. Off to the side of the lounge is a computer for the guests' use. To the left of reception is their wonderful breakfast room. I have to say that the other reviews were right, they make the best coffee and hot chocolate. The hotel claims that it's the machine that makes it that way but we say that if it wasn't for the staff's special touch, it wouldn't taste as good. You can always grab a drink during the day. The staff is the best I have ever encountered. Giacinto, Luisa, Laura, Marco, Stefania, and the rest of the staff (forgive me that I don't know their names) can rival anyone at a 5 star hotel chain. The painting in the lounge by the way was done by Giacinto. It's amazing. He is so talented. As soon as I saw the colour scheme for the hotel I knew that it captured the colours of Tuscany. Luisa knew what she was doing when it came to paint colours!!! The soft orangey sunset colour of the reception room, the greens and golds of the colours of the Tuscan hills and sunsets. The walls in the hallway and the tiled floor are a warm and inviting cream colour and so are all the doors. We were received at reception by Giacinto (a sweetheart that you just can't resist) and check in was so smooth and easy going. Luisa showed us to our room and showed us how things worked in the room. Our bedroom was so inviting and relaxing. Again, the colours of Tuscany represented on the beds and on the walls. The bathroom was absolutely gorgeous. Heated towel racks and very contemporary. The shower and water pressure were great!!! The glass tiles in the bathroom were an earthy bronze colour which to me reflected the colours of the dome and again the gold tiles represented the sunsets. And what a view from our room!!! The bells of Sant Maria Maggiore Church actually moved when the bells rang. How I miss the sound of those bells. But when the windows are closed you don't hear a thing. But we kept them open most of the times just so we could hear the sounds of the bells. And there were pots of geraniums in the window too. What a great touch. I watered them every morning using my little plastic drinking cup. (I'm a gardener and so I just couldn't resist). From our room there was also a view of a courtyard which was being worked on so I'm interested to see what it's going to look like when I go back. Everyone was so helpful. A great hot and cold breakfast from 7:30 am to 10:30 am but people were still being served at 11 am. How great is that!!!! If you walk away from breakfast hungry then it's your own fault. Really good pastries and cheeses and salami and oh, it's so good.......Happy Hour from 6 pm to 8 pm. and the wine they serve is really, really, really good!! The staff is so friendly that it feels like you're a part of the family and not staying at a hotel. We had many conversations with all of them and it was as if they were all old friends. Check-out couldn't have been smoother either. The cleaning staff is so friendly too, and, truly, we have never stayed in a hotel that has been this spotless. On the same floor as reception they have an equally beautiful and extremely large bathroom. The staff goes above and beyond with suggestions and referrals and I swear that they know everybody in the city because you can always get what you're looking for. So my recommendation is to stay at this hotel and have a marvelous time and let your worries and cares just fly out the window because that's exactly what happened to us. Ciao al prossimo.

<Content>A Gem in the Heart of Firenze This is the third time I've stayed at Il Perseo and will definitely stay there again when I return to Firenze. Not only does it have the perfect location-- half a block from the Duomo--but the people who run it are fantastic. All of them speak English but graciously allow guests to practise their basic Italian. They can recommend restaurants, shops, daytrips, and must-sees and will even make reservations on your behalf. When I stayed there most recently, the hotel was completely full, yet the people at the desk were charming, relaxed and friendly.  Il Perseo's been renovated recently and features flat-screen tvs, en-suite bathrooms  air conditioning. It's also impeccably clean and bright. Breakfasts are served in a hip little breakfast room which doubles as a lounge--a welcome respite from the throngs outside--at night.  Because the hotel is housed in a very old building, its ceilings are high and its huge windows look out over the tiled roofs of neighbouring buildings, so simpy relaxing in your room is a visual treat. I highly recommend this little gem.

<Content>Fantastic! Two other girls and I stayed here during our recent trip to Florence. I would certainly recommend it for young people. We just walked in and booked a room (after a terrible hostel experience), and couldn't have asked for a better deal. The price was fantastic, and the room was clean. There was a happy hour that night, and the staff could not have been more courteous. Next time I'm in Florence, this is where I'm staying!

<Content>Perseo is a Gem! Hotel Perseo is just about perfect. I stayed at the Perseo in early May with my best friend. We were thrilled.Perfectly located in Florence, it is only a few minutes walk to just about everything you need, the train station, the bus station, the Duomo, the Ponte Vecchio, the Uffizi, the Accademia, etc., etc.The staff was wonderful. Laura was a big help from the moment we made our reservation. She helped us with tickets to the Uffizi and Accademia, she suggested restaurants, she made us laugh! Stephanie, Doni and everyone always greeted us with a smile and had great suggestions.The rooms were beautiful. Bright modern colors on the walls complemented the crisp modern furnishings. The bathroom was nicely appointed. Very comfortable bedding. The room and bath are small, but hey, you're in Florence, you shouldn't be in your room anyway.Breakfast was adequate, but a nice unexpected surprise was happy hour every evening between 5-8. Grab a complementary glass of wine while figuring out what to do for dinner. A nice treat.I can't wait to go back to Hotel Perseo!

<Content>Loved Hotel Il Perseo! We visited Florence in early May 2007 and stayed at the Il Perseo for two nights. What a great little hotel. Very clean, friendly and very helpful staff and in the middle of everything, just steps from the Duomo! We loved it and would return in a minute if only we could. . . 4 travelers from Ohio

<Content>Great Little Hotel in the Heart of Florence Me and my travelling group (five people total) had three rooms in the Hotel Il Perseo for three nights in August of 2006.Location was good... close to the train station and very central (i.e. we walked everywhere in Florence from the hotel). Don't be fooled by the shabby looks of the building. It is an old building, but the Perseo has been recently remodeled and is in fantastic shape. All our rooms were clean and spacious, and had flat-screen televisions w/basic cable.The Perseo has internet access on a laptop that they let hotel guests use, which was nice for checking in with our families/friends back home.Pricing was comparable to the other four hotels we stayed at while in Italy. We booked direct via e-mail, which worked flawlessly. Breakfast was very good and included with our stay.

<Content>We Loved The Hotel Perseo We loved the Hotel Perseo in Florence. It was our first time in Florence and we for the money we could not have chosen a better place, price and location wise. All of the rooms have been re-done. Ours was clean, modern, stylish and well appointed with a great view of the Duomo. The bathroom was excellent with great water pressure and very up to date features. The service and hospitality could not have been better. The Front desk staff was incredibly helpful, making restaurant reservations, offering patient advise and in my case a lessons in Italian. Breakfast was served each morning in the hospitality room and we enjoyed delicious cappuccino every day along with pastries and other options including fresh fruit and cereal. The owners have been in the business for years and hopefully will remain for years to come. They were gracious, charming and very helpful. Besides the service and hospitality the next best feature of Hotel Perseo was the location. It is literally right around the corner from the Duomo and just a couple of blocks from the indoor public market (a must). I cannot say enough good things about our stay at Hotel Perseo. FIVE STARS!!

<Content>The Best Keeps Getting Better Il Perseo has long been a favorite hotel of mine. I think I have stayed there about 4 times and each time is better than the last. Since my last visit two years ago they have completely remodeled and it looks fabulous. The rooms are immaculate and remarkably quiet considering its fantastic central location. Walking distance from the train station and about a block from the Duomo.The staff was truly amazing. Everyone was curtious and helpful, particularly Doni who made us cappucino at 5am and helped us get our bags down and loaded into an early morning taxi. He really went the extra mile and wouldn't even accept a tip! Laura was also fun during Happy Hour, chatting and giving us good leads on restaurants. Louise was also very helpful with getting museum tickets. We were able to get some laundry done as well which was a wonderful touch. All in all I cannot think of one negative thing about Il Perseo. I will stay there every time I go to Florence. It is just the best.

<Content>Small rooms, okay location We were supposed to stay at another location but had to switch last minute. So we didn't have a lot of options as we were driving at the time. I happened to have this hotels information so we contacted them to see if they had a room for 5 nights. They said they did, but we were going to have to change rooms a couple times. So we decided to go there at least for one night and then figure things out. When we got there, there was no parking nearby and we had to wait for someone to come pick up the car from the parking garage. My husband waited outside for around 15 minutes. The hotel does not have anyone to help you with your bags, so you have to lug them into this very tiny elevator. The staff the night we arrived were very nice. We were just happy to have a room to sleep in. The room was very tiny. We were tired and hungry and they didn't have a restaurant. Unfortunately, there was not much right around the location so we had to walk for a while to find something. The great thing, was that we had internet access in our room so we were able to figure out where we would go next. We checked out the next day and went on our way. If you don't mind a small room without many amenities, it is not a bad place to stay.

<Content>Perfect Hotel Perfect Hotel. Location, quality, service, everything was excellent. Room and bathroom are really modern and clean. Location is really close to the train station and all sites. We had to leave early, but staff arranged breakfast just for us. Breakfast is light and delicious with bread, cereal, prosciutto, honey, juices, and scrumptious coffee. They also have happy hour where they have free wine and snacks. Staff is really friendly and speak English well (both rare in Italy). Loved our experience!!

<Content>excellent location Hotel Perseo is the perfect place to stay in Florence. It is right down the street from the Duomo and centrally located so that where ever you go you are always within walking distance of the hotel (makes bathroom breaks a breeze). The hotel is modern with free internet service in your room if you have your own computer, or use theirs. Breakfast is ample and the staff can't be beat for helpfulness. They booked our museum times for us and gave us some excellent restaurant suggestions in the different parts of the city so we would see it all. A pleasure to stay here.

<Content>I wish we could have stayed longer! We loved this hotel. The location is great. It鈥檚 within blocks of the train station and just around the corner from the Duomo. The hotel itself is on the 3rd floor which you must reach by taking the elevator or stairs. They have security cameras so this is not a worry. The rooms are very clean, contemporary, very quiet, and comfortable. The staff is excellent, everyone spoke English very well 鈥揺specially Laura. We loved her -she made wonderful food and activity recommendations for us every day. They have 鈥淗appy Drink鈥?every evening from 6-8 where they serve snacks and drinks (their version of happy hour). They serve a complementary continental breakfast each morning from 6:30-10am. It鈥檚 a very casual atmosphere. I wish we had stayed longer.

<Content>Outstanding Hotel and Staff The staff at this hotel has been simply outstanding. My wife became ill with the stomach flu as soon as we arrived in Florence. Over the course of two days, I have dealt with most of the staff and they have all been equally compassionate and helpful with my wife's illness. They have helped tremendously to ease the difficulty of our situation and we are both incredibly thankful. Aside from the wonderful staff, the hotel itself is excellent. The rooms are recently updated, clean, modern, and very comfortable. It is located less than 2 minutes walk from the Duomo in a vibrant area with many places to eat and shop close by. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Our next time in Florence we will be staying at the Hotel Perseo!

<Content>Our favorite! We were so pleased with Hotel Il Perseo. My husband and I stayed for 3 nights in early April. The staff was fantastic! Everyone was very friendly. They made reservations for us at popular attractions before our arrival, gave great suggestions for restaurants, and were helpful in every way. The rooms, lobby and breakfast area are very modern and stylish, and kept very clean. The breakfast had the best variety of our entire stay in Italy - the cappucino is to die for! Our room was small (but plenty big enough since we were hardly in it anyway), but had a large closet and a nice little balcony, which we weren't expecting. The bed was the most comfortable I encountered in 2 weeks of traveling Italy. The location is great - walking distance to all the sights and conveniently close to the train station. We also appreciated the free internet access in the lobby. We would stay here again without a second thought and would recommend it to all our friends  relatives!

<Content>Favorite Hotel in Italy We just returned from a fantastic trip to Italy. Our favorite hotel was Il Perseo in Florence. We had a quad with a private bath. The room was good sized and very clean. We had a spectacular view of the Duomo from our windows. The staff was VERY friendly and helped us find fantastic restaurants in Florence. You cannot beat the location. Minutes from the Duomo and all other attractions. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Nice hotel, good value, well located My husband, three children and I stayed here in April of 2007. We were very comfortable, and the hotel was extremely clean. The website photos accurately portray the hotel. I thought it was an excellent value, especially since it is so close to the Duomo and all of the Florence sights. Very reliable hotel, and helpful staff. Thanks very much for a great stay!

<Content>Location, friendly staff, great rooms No complaints! For a great price we enjoyed a wonderful location, a very helpful staff and a quality room.Location:This hotel has a great location that is really smack dab in the middle of the city's attractions. Nothing is a far walk, including the train station.Rooms:Our room was large, nicely appointed, clean and had a great bathroom. It even had a nice view. We were only two people but booked a triple room (the doubles were sold out) so it was especially spacious.Service:The staff helped us plan our days exploring the area. They knew the city well and were excited to help share suggestions.I really cannot thing of one negative thing to say about this lovely hotel other than it lacks an impressive entrance since the first couple floors are not used by the hotel. But thats hardly a reason not to stay here.

<Content>Family Room with a View Great for a small family group. I, my wife, daughter  son-in-law stayed 3 night in the family room on the top floor. Climbing from the 3rd to the 4th floor (the elevator stops at 3) was challenging for my wife but it was worth it for the view of the Duomo. The staff was great and helped with booking tours of the museums. Location is near perfect for touring the city on foot and it is a short walk to the train station. Room while small was clean, modern and well fitted.

<Content>Very enjoyable stay I was staying in Florence for three nights in March 2007, and had a very pleasant stay here. This is a good quality modern 3* tourist hotel, that avoids the soulless nature of chain hotels. The biggest plus points would be:1) Location. It's between the main train station (10 minutes walk) and the Duomo (50 yards away) and it makes it easy to access all the major Florence sites by foot.2) Staff. The hotel is run by an Australian woman and her Italian husband (an architect who was in charge of the 2006 refurbishment) who are both very friendly and helpful (as are the rest of their staff). I was able to enjoy a very pleasant chat with the proprietor over a couple of glasses of good Italian red! For those (like me) whose Italian isn't what it could be, it is helpful to have English speaking hotel staff to give you advice.3) Room quality. The hotel was refurbished at the start of 2006, so you get modern fixtures and fittings (flat screen TV, good air-conditioning/heating, good shower, comfortable bed etc). This is a chintz free zone(!). Of course if you like flowery bespreads or faux-antique style rooms then by all means stay somewhere else...Many other things also add-up to an enjoyable stay. Good buffet breakfast, free internet access in the lobby (and I believe the rooms, although I didn't have a laptop with me), rooms and corridors kept clean and tidy etc.To be clear, this is very definitely a tourist hotel, and isn't trying to be anything else. So don't come here on business expecting a restaurant / conference facilities / mini-bar etc. But if (like me) you just wanted somewhere to sleep and eat breakfast before a long day of sightseeing then I think you'd find it hard to beat in this price range.My (minor) quibbles would be:1) My room was near the stairwell, and it could be a little noisy when people were coming back late at night.2) The street entrance is not the most appealing (the hotel occupies the upper floors of a larger building, with the lobby on the 3rd floor)But that's being petty, and overall I was very pleased with this hotel and would recommend it to other travellers on a moderate budget.

<Content>Excellent hotel, perfect location A very friendly staff speaking perfect English and replying to your e-mail within a few hours.The rooms are of different sizes but very clean, sheets and towels changed every day. The design of the rooms is modern with a lot of taste (you will not like it only if you expect a traditional Florentine style).The hotel is located on the 3rd and 4th floor of an old building, so you do not hear any noise from the street.Breakfast was perfect - every morning warm bread rolls and croissants, fruit juice, tea, capucino, cereals (no fried eggs or saussages).In fact, I do not have any negative remarks. There is a car parking (currently at the rate of 24 euros per day) for people who come by car. For its perfect location I think the prices are very reasonable.

<Content>Friendly wonderful hotel We found Il Perseo via trip advisor but phoned to book and stayed there for two nights in February. It was an excellent choice for many reasons.We arrived by train and it was a short and easy walk from the station, but at the same time close to the Duomo, so very central. On the third floor it was easily reached by lift.It has been newly renovated, our room was tastefully decorated (there was a flat screen TV )a good size,room and had an excellent bathroom with very modern and attractive fittings, and it was so quiet.Laura on the desk was so friendly and helpful and willing to obtain tickets and book restaurants for us.Breakfast was very good, cornetti, choice of buns, cheese, cereal, yoghurt, fruit juice, jams, honey and best of all one of the best cappuccinos I had on that trip!Free internet use was very convenient too.I loved the Happy Hour in the evening 鈥?a very warm and welcoming gesture.What more can I say? Would I stay there again? Yes I would and highly recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Great Hotel, great people We (my wife, my 4 year old son and I) stayed at the Hotel Perseo for 4 nights in February 2007. The Hotel was great. The room was very clean and modern. The location is excellent (right next to the Dom). But the real treats are the people who run the hotel. Very nice and helpful. They had a two hour Happy Hour ever evening for all guests. Drinks were free and this was a great setting to meet and mingle with other travelers and the proprietors.We would come here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Fantastico e molto centrale Hi, just returned from 4 nights at Il Perseo. This hotel was recommended to us by friends. We were warned not to be put off by the entrance as the hotel is on the 3rd, 4th  5th floors of what appears to be an apartment block. Once you get to the reception area, meet the very friendly staff and are shown to your room, you know you have chosen the right hotel.We emailed the hotel before we arrived and they booked both the Accademia  Uffizi for us on dates and times that suited us, they recommended restaurants once we had arrived, gave us a map and showed us how to find the restaurants. They booked a taxi to Firenze airport for us when we left. All the staff speak English, are patient if you want to try your Italian out and are extremely helpful and friendly.The rooms are fantastic, large enough, with heating/airconditioning, TV, desk, armchair and we had an en-suite shower room. The decor is modern and it is very clean. All in all very comfortable.Breakfast is included and consisted of tea/coffee - any sort of coffee you want, espresso, cappucino, americano etc, juices, breads, pastries, cereal, ham  cheese, fruit and yoghurt. They had a lovely idea, whilst we were there they had a happy hour (or two) in the evenings where you were invited to come to the bar/dining area for an aperitivo (drink) before you headed out for your evening meal. It was on the house and there were also some nibbles. What a fantastic idea, great opportunity to meet other guests. (Hi to the Thomas's from Wales who we met whilst we were there - hope you enjoyed the rest of your stay).One last thing - location, what can I say, fantastic. Right near the Duomo, never far from anywhere. Florence isn't very large and you could walk everywhere as we did.Ciao a tutti e buon viaggio

<Content>Fantastic  I stayed at this hotel for two weeks as I was studying in Florence at the time. When you arrive the entrance is a little bit of a shock to the system: you think,,,what have i booked into? But once you reach the welcome desk meet the owners, and see your room that feeling quickly disappears.I havn't got a bad word to say about this hotel, I travel alot and found this to be one of the best I have stayed in. The location is unbeatable, the staff are fantastic, and the rooms have everything you may need. I was travelling alone so safety was also an issue, and again this hotel was great in this respect.At one point i trapped my finger in the door (completely my fault!) and the staff rushed to my aid, and saved my finger (I was studying piano so i needed the finger!). The ice and plasters came out immediately and they were sooo kind.The day before arriving I had stayed in the new 5* Hilton in Manchester, in the Penthouse suite as my brother was getting married there, and I can tell you that this hotel was ten times better than the hilton. Everything worked and everything I needed was in my room....(something that the hilton in manchester should take note of!)going to florence? go and stay at this hotel....!!

<Content>Great hotel We stayed as a family at this hotel after Christmas 2006. The hotel has an excellent location, it's very central and only a quick walk from the station. The owners/management are on hand for advice and help. The family room (one large double) and two twin beds was modern, clean, quiet and tastefully decorated. The breakfast was tasty, fresh and healthy. We enjoyed staying here and would definitely return there if visiting Florence again. I have recommended this hotel to friends. It's good value for money, small boutique style, bright , clean and comfortable.

<Content>A Little Gem in Florence... We came across this place after getting into Florence and finding that the first hotel we booked wasn't all that it had been described as. So we were just thrilled to have found Il Perseo. We walked in, asked the reception desk if they had space for us and they did. We went and gathered our gear and brough it back to Il Perseo. The staff was fantastic (and all speak English) and were very helpful in getting reservations at restaurants and scheduling cabs to pick us up for the airport. The rooms were exactly what we were looking for. They are absolutely spotless and spacious for Europe. The bed was quite comfortable. Our room had a sink and mirror in it, and we had a couple of shared bathrooms on the floor (they do have rooms w/private bathrooms if desired). It was perfect. One of the bathrooms was always available. Our room was on the same floor as the reception desk which I think is a good plan. This hotel is in a perfect location. It's just down the street from the duomo and close to the train station. If you are a walker like we are, you can walk to all of the sites from this location. They offer a continential breakfast that includes cereal, yogurt, prepackaged pastries and the absolute greatest coffee I have ever tasted in my life. Overall, if you're looking for a nice pensione (small budget hotel) in Florence, I highly recommend the Hotel Il Perseo.

<Content>Great location and friendly staff Visited florence and stayed at the Perseo. Arrived by bus and its only a short walk from the train/bus station. Location couldn't be better, just by the duomo. We had a family room and was pleased to see it was very clean, modern and spacious. We even had a view of the duomo, although it was spoilt by a few tv aerials and a vent pipe.The staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was included and there was quite a selection. From the hotel, all the sites were within easy reach. Overall, a very good trip and the stay was certainly worthwhile.

<Content>Cool calm oasis in the heart of Florence We stayed at Hotel Perseo in September at the height of the tourist season- with heat and crowds. The hotel provided an oasis right in the heart of Florence. Its only metres from the Duomo and yet is calm, quiet and newly renovated. The facilities are excellent including internet, TV lounge and breakfast room and the staff are incredibly helpful - not only booking us for the uffizi and accademia but also our train tickets when (sadly) it was time to leave.

<Content>Ideal for us Spent alot of time reviewing hotels and this clearly paid off as it was great for our needs. It is within a 5 minute walk to the train station and bus stations, which we needed as we were travelling around Tuscany. The room we had was ultra quiet, no street noise whatsoever. Had a slightly disturbed sleep on the last evening as some rowdy american neighbours staggered in at 4am, but it didn't really bother us. It was very modern and clean and warm, very cosy. Breakfast was simple but normal for italian cities. It was fresh and fine for our needs as we are not big breakfast eaters. Free internet access which was also really useful. Staff were helpful and answered any queries/questions we had. Would definately recommend if you want a central location. Not as picturesque as some of the arno view hotels but if you are planning on travelling around it is ideal. Don''t be put off by the entrance, i was concerned when i first arrived but the rooms are lovely

<Content>good vibes at il perseo I found this Hotel on Trip Advisor and was happy to get five nights during the busy September season in Florence. The hotel is located on several upper floors of a large building about 50 steps from the Duomo. The location is outstanding. My room was large, well equipped and very modern in styling. flat screen tv, remote controlled air conditioner, high tech phone. Everything is new. Great shower, free internet access, and nice breakfasts every morning. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and the whole place is kept very clean. This was my second trip to Florence and I found this hotel to be a great value for the price.

<Content>Modern chic, clean, convenient, great staff. I live in Florence and a friend asked me to find her a hotel near everything. Of course I read Trip Advisor first before surfing the web. All good reviews so I told her I preferred this one to a couple of others in the area with good enough reviews. And as I looked more into this hotel I found it to be only nonsmoking rooms which is wonderful and very rare in europe except the large chains and that they speak english. So she was happy from the pics from their website and this information. She stayed 3 nights and just left and probably will write her own review. She said she will always stay here. But I felt I needed to write one too as I was very impressed. It is so close to everything that we came back to the hotel several times as she forgot to close the window as it was cold, then we came back again to use the bathroom. So it is so convenient if you need to unload your packages, get your coat, or whatever. Also it is very cool and tastefully remodeled in subdued chic style. It is small but that is the italian quaint. You still know you are in Italy unlike the chains. Visitors are not allowed in the rooms so I only peeked in her room for a few seconds and it had a lovely view, nice and bright, flat screen tv on wall, large new bathroom. The website pics do not do it justice. The staff are so nice. My friend was alone so she felt safe and well cared for. It is near the train station that you could easily walk if you travel light. But her room was silent, no noise from the street.The hotel is renovated new, it is near everything, it is cool yet quaint. I will recommend it to anyone who asks me where to stay.

<Content>Hotel Perseo - a Returned Guest We have stayed at Hotel Perseo before the renovations - and what a make-over it has been! Modern appointments in the room from cable TV to 5-Star bathroom fitouts, to modern bedside lights to airconditioning to a delightful re-fit of the compact but well appointed bar / breakfast room with a typical modern italian makeoverThe bed was great, the room was big (for a European 3 star hotel room), the bathroom was espicially a delight, compared to other hotels we have stayed at with the same star rating. Everything was new, clean, visually pleasing and worked!We found out whilst we were there that the co-owner, Louise Monk, an ex-pat Australian and married to her architect  designer husband, Giacinto has incorporated features and a design aspect that we would normally associate with the upmarket American  Asian hotels, not the squashy / couldn't swing a cat in the place aesthetics normally associated with this level of European hotel.A delight to stay in and because it is right smack in the middle of Florence, (step out the front door and throw a stone and you will hit the front doors of the Duomo) it is great value across so many aspects.A definite winner and well worth experiencing the quaintness of Europe by finding the reception on Level 3 of this building - it feels like you have somehow found a hiden treasure, that you want to keep secret from the rest of the tourist world, in case the word gets out and you can't get a bed there when next in town.8 out of 10Paul ConnellyManaging DirectorSareen StoneSydney, Australia

<Content>perfectly clean and modern, perfect location I absolutly loved hotel perseo! It was the perfect location, less then a block from the beautifull duomo, awesome shopping all around. The staff was so sweet and helpfull and spoke perfect english. They offered to make reservations for the Uffuzia and Accedemia for me , before i even thought to ask which enabled me to sail right in while the lines streched down and around the corner! The lift was broke one day, but only for a couple hours. I would absolutly reccomend this hotel!!

<Content>Very Happy Great location, very quiet (which one doesn't always get in a bustling Italian city), very helpful staff (not just the owners, but all staff at all hours) - they booked advanced gallery tickets, gave us good recommendations for dining, and were terrifically helpful and friendly, which hit the spot after a long day on our feet visiting all Florence has to offer.Delicious breakfasts, very attractive redesign of rooms, hallways and common areas. We'd strongly recommend this hotel to others!Carolee  Jon, San Francisco

<Content>Perseo is an absolute gem in heart of Florence My mom and I had a fabulous 5 nights in Florence and the amazing owners of the Hotel Perseo went over and above any expectation we may have had!! From entering the lovely, modern reception, to a warm and hearty Italian greeting we were thrilled with our choice. The rooms were so clean and modern and bathrooms glistened, it was sometimes hard to believe the building is likely hundreds of years old. The breakfast room was charming with great selection in the morning and my favorite cappucino every day.They offered to make our reservations for the main galleries (or else we wouldn't have gotten in due to the huge crowds), recommended great local dining, answered all our questions with great joy and genuinely we felt we were staying in someone's home instead of a hotel. We'd stay again in a heart beat and would highly recommend Perseo. The location can't be beat and the rooms were very quiet too despite being less than a block from the Duomo. We miss them already and can't wait to get back.

<Content>Great location We were at the Perseo Hotel at the beginning of July. We loved the location, so close to the centre and not too far from the Railway Station. We are a family of 4 and the room was big enough for all of us to have some space, the bathroom very modern and it was very clean. The breakfast room was a bit small but the service was good. The lift was a bit small and old and at times did not work. Before leaving home we ask with an e-mail to book for us to go up the Tower of Pisa but they said that the phone was always busy and they could not book it. They told us they sent us an e-mail saying that and advising us to book through internet but we never got that e-mail and would have been nice if they would have book it for us. The bookings for the museum were fine.

<Content>Fantastic place to stay We have just returned from a wonderful 4 night stay at Hotel Perseo, the hotel has been recently renovated and was much nicer than we expected. Our room was large and very comfortable, the bathroom bigger than the ones in the other hotels we stayed in (great water pressure in the shower!!!)Everyone at the front desk was extremely helpful and gave us great tips on where to eat and what to visit. We did all our forward train bookings with Laura at the front desk - and she got everything just right which made our travels so much easier. The location was just fantastic so close to everything we wanted to see. This was by far the nicest hotel we stayed in on our trip and we have already recommended it to our friends travelling in October. We will definitely be going back Wendy and HarryAuckland New Zealand

<Content>Great coffee and wonderful location in Florence Hotel Perseo is a wonderful location,right in the center of Florence, for walking to all the art museums and churches. How we loved seeing the art work at the Accademia  the Uffizi, and because of the owner's help we had reservations for these museums even before we left the USA! Owner Loise was a delightful hostess, and we loved the fantastic coffee served by the gracious staff. The continental breakfasts were fresh and delicious and just the right way to start the day. The newly renovated room was comfortable, clean, simple, and attractive. Our fifth floor family room included a king-size bed as well as two singles and had a view of the Duomo. We received clean towels daily and enjoyed the new shower. The ONLY drawback was lack of closet space, but we didn't mind.

<Content>Nice hotel, Great Location, Reasonable Price Hotel Il Perseo was a nice hotel. Our room was newly renovated, with a flat screen TV, a new air conditioniing unit and new modern furniture. The location was great, one block from the Duomo, and in the middle of Florence's shopping district. Also, it was a short seven to ten minute walk to the train station. My only warning would be to be prepared to awake at 6:45AM for the first set of ringing church bells. It is no particular fault of the hotel, but if you stay anywhere around the Duomo, expect to wake up at that time and then every hour thereafter. The staff was helpful and all spoke English really well. The hotel was very reasonably priced and included a nice little breakfast. I would definitely consider returning here on my next trip to Florence.

<Content>GREAT!!!! This hotel is great. Although the sign on the street says that it is only a one star hotel it seemed more like a three or four star. The hotel looks like an IKEA show room. The staff is English speaking and incredibely helpful. The Australian woman that owns the hotel (with her Italian husband) is so nice and will help you book buses or tours to anywhere you want to go. We went to the designer oulets, Sienna and a Chianti wine tasting tour all with her scheduling help. The location is unbeatable. The room was big and clean. The only negative was that the shower was very small but it seriously didn't matter. I would stay here again any day.

<Content>Budget hotel in a great location This hotel was not bad, however, it was the worst out of all the ones we stayed at in Italy. It is in a great central location, right near the Duomo. The price is right, and it was fairly clean. We had to change rooms at first, because the restaurant below us burned steak or something, so the room was smoky. Later that night, around 1 a.m., there was a group of women below us (in an apartment, not in the hotel) drinking wine and laughing and talking very loud. They would not shut their window, nor would they lower their voices. We and another room had to yell at them to shut up, which still didn't work. Our experience here wasn't too unpleasant, but I'm sure there are other hotels in a great location at a good value that you can be at other than here. For a budget-minded, no-frills, back-packer type place, this hotel delivers.

<Content>Convenient and Clean We just spent a few days at the hotel and enjoyed our stay. The staff was very friendly and helpful, easy to communicate with in Engligh. The rooms are simple, but the beds are comfortable and there are sinks in the room. The windows kept out the noise so we had easy nights of rest, though I was awakened by the bells of the Duomo each morning at 7am. The hotel was less than 10 minutes to all of the sights, as well as the train station. The shared bathrooms were spotless. Breakfast wasn't bad--slightly dry bread, yogurt, cereal, and juice. I'd recommend staying here in the future.

<Content>No frills, but good, clean place We stayed in a Quad-Room for 3 nights in early February. The beds were comfortable, the heat worked, we had hot water. There was a phone in the room. No TV, but who's in Florence to watch TV anyway?There was an internet cafe in the lobby that we could use for free. (I think during peak times, there is a reasonable charge.)The staff is very friendly, helpful, and speaks English. For anyone on a budget, this is an excellent place. It's located near the Termini and the Duomo. Breakfast was typical of other places in Italy we stayed. (Bread, Coffee, Juice, Cereal, etc.)

<Content>sweet and caring staff I just stayed in Hotel Perseo and couldn't say better things about it. Sure people will find something bad in this place if they are looking for a luxury hotel, but for a measly 55 euro a night I was more than happy with this place. After staying at a string of hotels/hostels that didn't provide adequate heating from the cold Jan nights, I was pleasantly surprised the Perseo had plentiful heat AND individual thermostats. Lovely. The room itself was fine ... it was a bit sparse and dreary, but the bed was comfy and the room was spotless. The shared bathrooms are kept in good order as well. Good soundproofing as one night I woke to use the toilet and found a multi-room party going on in the next corridor that I hadn't heard a peep from when I was in my room. most of all Hotel Perseo had a very kind staff. I feel ill with a nasty bout of influenza whilst I was there and had to go to the doctor on an emergency basis. The first night I was there I was just getting sick and my boyfriend asked the receptionist for a good pharmacy in the area. From then on the receptionists constantly asked him how I was doing and sent him back with loads of tea for me. When I did actually surface, they would ask my how I was doing and set up the appointments with the doctor. I really appreciate all of their concern (and tea.)

<Content>Budget hotel, good location Excellent location (about 5 minutes from the train station and less than a minute to the Duomo). Good value. We had a double with ensuite. The room was large enough and the bathroom was fine.A few things to keep in mind:- Very friendly and helpful staff.- The elevator was a little tempermental, so you sometimes had to walk up several floors.- We stayed in November, so there wasn't a need for air conditioning. However, I didn't see any air conditioning...only a fan. That's something to keep in mind for Summer.- Free Internet access and reasonably priced drinks (soda, juice, beer, etc) in the lobby area.Bottom line is that it's a clean, reasonably priced hotel in a great location.

<Content>Trip From Hell! My family will never stay at this Hotel again. The staff was far from helpful. They told us they would get us tickets for the places around there, but didn't they didn't even try. There is no A/C, there is nothing to do there but sleep. The bed were hard as rocks. They had a lift that you could use but it never worked. The place is cheap and that is all. Please do not stay here. They have breakfast but there is nothing there, warm juice or milk with stale bread and warm yogurt. This place was a nightmare for the time we got there till we left. Please just think twice before staying here.

<Content>Friendly Staff  In May 2004 My friend and i stayed in a double room on the 5th floor at Hotel Il Perseo, our room was clean, spacious, bright and sunny, the bathroom was a little small. We had fresh towels every day, and a great breakfast of cereal and croissants. The staff speak english and are really cheery and friendly. 5 minutes fom station and 1 minute from the duomo. I would stay back here again.
