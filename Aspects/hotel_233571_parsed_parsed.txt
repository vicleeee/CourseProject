<Content>OK hotel near Eiffel The hotel is OK, small and stylish. The personnel are polite and and service minded which is not the case with all the employyes in tourist industry in this country according to foreigner , ) The surroundings are nice and piecefull. If you fancy Eiffel tower this is a good hotel. If you would like to be in heart of the partying, this might not be your choice..

<Content>Great little hotel! Great hotel for our family. We have 2 boys ages 12 and 13. We had the family suite which was actually 2 rooms with our own little hallway with a separate door. The bathrooms were actually a fine size and the beds very comfortable. The hotel is very close to a metro stop and 5 minutes to the Eiffel Tower. The lady at the front desk was extremely helpful. The breakfast was very good.The only complaint was we were on the first floor and we heard quite a bit of noise. I would recommend staying on a upper floor and on the back side of the hotel to try to eliminate some early morning noise. (5 - 6am) But, by no means would this prevent me from staying there again. Very good hotel!

<Content>Christmas at Cadran My husband and I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and most spoke English fluently. Check-in was efficient and it was easy for us to store our bags for the day after check-out. The reception area has just been renovated and was modern and welcoming. We had a free Seine River cruise as part of the Christmas special and this was a lovely added bonus for our trip.Our room was very clean, warm, quiet and comfortable. The beds are amazing - you'll be sure to have a solid sleep. Bathroom was small, but very clean and modern. The shower was great - although due to the design, water does tend to end up all over the floor. Towels are fluffy and plentiful. Our room was small, but had everything we needed. Flat screen TV included! The decor is simple, modern and funky and the lighting system for the hotel is unique and inviting.The free wifi in the rooms is also a great asset to this hotel. The breakfast is very good for Paris standards. The coffee machine is a dream in the mornings (hot chocolate is yum!) and there is a really good amount of choice - esp for a small hotel. The breakfast room itself has a lot of atmosphere - we loved it!We also absolutely loved the location of this hotel. It is easy to find and is so close to many great sights in the city. However, as I mentioned above, it is very quiet and private. We visited the market street of Rue Cler daily and had many a wonderful meal / snack there. Cafe Central, Cafe du Marche and Tribeca are all very good. The crepe place down the street is also def worth a try. Cheap and delicious!I have been to Paris 3 times before this trip and our stay at Cadran was FAR superior to anything else I have experienced. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, but especially young couples and singles (and anyone wanting a clean, comfortable, safe, modern and friendly stay in central Paris). We had a friend meeting us in Paris and she stayed at the same hotel and was also very impressed. She used to live in the city and agreed that it was an excellent standard of 3-star hotel. For the price, it was very good value for this city and I have the feeling that this hotel will be very popular for years to come. Book early!We would absolutely return to this hotel.

<Content>Loved du Cadran Hi, just wanted to tell you that we had a wonderful 5 nights at the du Cadran in Paris. The hotel looks like it has been recently totally refurbished and everything was new and funky. The actual room itself is small but adequate. Probably the only criticism is that there is insufficient shelf space - only a ledge. But the cupboard is good and the bathroom is fantastic. Flat screen TV and mini bar. We didn't take up the breakfast option - it looked pricey at e13 pp given that the hotel is 20m from Rue Clare where there are wonderful restaurants, bars, bakery etc. You can live like a local and it made Paris very reasonable for us. Bus and Metro access was simple and all in all du Cadran was excellent value especially by Paris standards. Highly recommended.

<Content>Perfect stay in Paris We decided to spend a romantic weekend in Paris and to celebrate my girlfriends 30th birthday. The hotel met every one of my expectations and I didn't mind the superior room size at all. The bed was perfect and provided a very peaceful nights sleep.The hotel staffs were extremely friendly and provided excellent recommendations for eating and we were not disappointed at all. It was very cold outside and the temperature of the rooms was at an acceptable level though the temperature in the room was not able to be changed (I think the thermostat was stuck on a pre defined setting), though it didn't matter as the setting was perfect for sleeping.I would definitely stay here again as the location and the fresh food markets around the corner made this hotel one of my favourite places to stay in Paris.

<Content>Location Location Location Hotel du Cadran is a block off Rue Cler on Champs de Mars. Situated between the Eiffel Tower and Napoleon's Tomb (Invalides) the location is perfect. The neighborhood is the perfect idyllic french street- excellent cafes on the corner, bakers, butchers, and wine stores all within stones throw. We're quite active- so one day we walked all the way to the Arc du Triomphe and the next all the way to Notre Dame. For everyone else, the #8 line is nearby, and takes you anywhere you need to go.We stayed in a Superior King room - although a french king must be smaller than it's US counterpart. The bed was comfy enough. The room was clean and modern, with an excellent view of the street below. The bathroom was equally well designed. The lighting system is especially nice and has a 3 setting dimmer in every room. The room also came with a flat screen tv- although only CNN and BBS were in english.The only problem we had was the electronic key card system went down, and the manager had to let us into our room on the second day. Meh- they'll fix that.

<Content>Charming hotel and good location This charming hotel is located near the metro station, Ecole Militaire. The size of the room is the average size of hotels in Paris (I mean it's small), but it is clean and comformtable. You can find a good cheeze shop (Marie-Anne Cantin) and a good bakery (Pain d'Epis) near the hotel. You had better to buy some bread and take them at your room as breakfast, because it is reasonable.

<Content>Clean but... Overall the hotel is very clean. There are some renovations still being done in the common areas of the lobby but it did not interfere with anything. The staff was wonderful! We had problems with the Wi-Fi, which was anything but high speed, and the whole hotel was set to heat for the winter. Our room stayed extrememly warm so we had to leave our window open all night long. The surrounding stores receive deliveries at very early hours therefore we had the noise of those deliveries come right into our room. With that, we did not get much sleep even with ear plugs! Carole at the hotel was very helpful and gave us a reduced rate for our trouble so staff was never the issue. We would not stay here again nor recommend anyone to unless the things mentioned would not concern them.

<Content>Perfect hotel at a perfect location My girlfriend and me stayed at the hotel Cadran over the wekend.The room we had was perfect. It was newly renovated, clean and had a modern design.Also the location of the hotel is perfect. It is only a short walk away from the Eiffel tower. The metro station and lots of good restaurants are just around the corner. Even though the room was very quiet.I highly recommend this hotel and I will definetly stay here again at my next Paris visit.

<Content>Good location, Nice Hotel My Husband  I are just back from a 4 day visit to Paris. We stayed in this lovely, modern hotel. The staff at reception were very friendly  helpful. Our room was small, very clean  very modern. We had a view of the top of the Eiffle Tower. Each night our bed was turned down for us.The Hotel is in a great location. There are plenty of caf茅s, restaurants, bakeries, supermarkets etc. near the Hotel. There is a lovely small bar across the road from the Hotel, the staff were lovely  friendly. The metro is near the hotel which is great for the journey from  to the airport  also for going sightseeing. We went on a Bicycle Tour which I must say is such a great way of seeing the city. We booked with Bike about Tours www.bikeabouttours.com Our tour guide Paul was really friendly  pointed out different sights that you would only see  hear about on the bike tour. We did a night cruise on the Seine which is so Romantic  really worth doing. We booked with Vedettes Point-Neuf www.vedettesdupontneuf.comI would definately recommend this Hotel.

<Content>Loved Hotel du Cadran! My mom and I stayed at the Hotel du Cadran for four days in October. We had such a lovely time! The staff really made the stay so enjoyable and made us feel very welcome. From the time of check-in we were impressed. We arrived very early on the first day and had asked the hotel if we could leave our bags there. Instead they invited us to have breakfast, and then went out of their way to see if there was an open room that we could check into early. During breakfast there was a very nice young man that spoke perfect English. He was so friendly and talked with us about what sights we should see and gave us some inside tips of what to do while we were in Paris. The room was very modern and chic, yet the hotel overall felt more like a quaint and inviting bed and breakfast. I highly recommend Hotel du Cadran. The staff, service, and location are fabulous! I can't wait to go back!

<Content>Live it, Love it. This hotel is in a fantastic spot. Cafes, deli's, boutique supermarket, just outside the front door. Short stroll to the Tower from were you can do the Hop on Hop off tour. Our room was newly renovated. The decor was very modern, but it blended with the older exterior of the hotel. Only whinge would be for those of us that have small kids and dont get to stay out too late, it would have been nice to have a few more english speaking TV channels but that would not stop me from staying there again.

<Content>Great boutique hotel in a perfect location Wonderful little hotel in a great location in Paris near Rue Cler, with its great shops and restaurants. We stayed ion the junior suite on the main floor and our only compliant was that we heard the noise form the lobby which meant that we were woken early each morning by the early risers !The room was larger than usual ( even for a suite) and was very modern and well equipped. Bed was super comfortable !We'd definitely stay again but woudl request a room further awauy from the lobby !

<Content>Loved the Hotel du Cadran We choose this hotel because we wanted to stay in a Paris neighborhood not at an American chain hotel. The Hotel du Cadran was a perfect choice. The staff was always friendly and helpful. The neighborhood was wonderful. There are restaurants and a wonderful bakery just down the street. Not to mention the Eiffel tower is a short walk away.

<Content>Great Room - Great Location My wife found the hotel online and based on other reviews decided to give it a chance. We could not have been more happy with our choice. The staff were friendly, very helpful and suggested several local places to dine, which all proved to be levels above the more touristy options. The room was a bit smaller than American standards, but fittingly sized considering the location. Everything was very modern, clean, and well up kept. We would and have recommended the Hotel du Cadran Tour Eiffel to people visiting Paris.

<Content>Love the Hotel du Cadran The hotel is in an excellent, safe location just a few minutes walk from the Eiffel tower. There are restaurants right outside the hotel along with grocery stores,a post office, a few places to shop and about a block away from a metro station.We highly reccommend Cafe Central right outside the hotel for dinner, we had a some spectacular dinners here. Our waiter got to know us and would just bring out our usual drinks. The risotto with asparagus and chicken is great, the pan seared tuna and my husband had a duck entree that was out of this world!The room we had, 505, was small but expected, newly decorated and clean. We could see the Eiffel at night from our room. They have hairdryers in each room and an iron you can borrow from the front desk. The hairdryer in the bathroom has an outlet fit for U.S wattage that we used to plug our cell phones into but you will need a converter for anything else. We only had two issues, the closet in this room was more like a cabinet without a bottom in it. The cabinet took up most of the wall space on one side of the bed and if you weren't careful could hurt yourself (which we did a couple of times). The other issue was the shower, there isn't a shower curtain so by the time your done water was everywhere and there isn't a shelf to put soap, shampoo, etc. All in all minor things we could live with and we would definately stay here again. I went in a friends room, 404, and it was a corner room with two windows, also with a view of the Eiffel. This room was much larger, has a bathtub with a shower and full sized closet. If we go back I'd probably opt for this type of room if available.The hotel also arranged a shuttle service to pick us up from the airport and take us back. We had a minor mix up on the pick up but it all worked out. It costs 60 EUR, cash only, and we would use their service again also.The staff was very helpful, courteous and willing to help provide whatever we needed. It was a pleasant stay and after seeing some of the pictures of hotels in Paris on Tripadvisor we were very relieved to see we choose the right one.

<Content>Great Hotel in Paris The hotel is incredibly well located, making it an easy walk to many of the sights, and also close to a metro station. The neighborhood it's in is not touristy (a huge bonus in our mind) and offers several fine restaurants, cafes, bakeries, etc. The hotel itself is nice--staff was very helpful, rooms were spotless, breakfast was fine. We would stay here again without hesitation.

<Content>Second year of satisfaction Last year was particularly good as breakfast was included in the price. This year the rooms have been refurbished tastefully, but the lighting is a bit over the top. Wife unable to apply make-up easily owing to the lighting/mirror situation. This is a minor detail, and doesn't detract from the total enjoyment of our visit. The staff knew we were visiting Paris for our 55th. Wedding Anniversary, and a bottle of Champagne arrived in our room almost as quickly as we did. The staff are all delightful individuals, and the breakfast is to be recommended. Will be booking again for our 56th.---(God willing) Eric  Elsie Armstrong, ENGLAND

<Content>Well situated, quiet, modern, and clean We are a 50-something gay couple (relatively quiet and retiring) that stayed for 6 nights at the Hotel du Cadran in an exterior standard room on the 3rd floor this past September. We initially heard about the hotel from Rick Steves' Paris 2008 guide and, based upon the preponderance of positive reviews from tripadvisor, decided to book our Paris stay here. Our experience matched those described by previous (recent) positive reviewers: the convenient location (close to major monuments, subways, restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores - without being in the middle of the overly crowded touristy areas); the welcoming, efficient, and helpful staff, the clean, modernized, (albeit small), and quiet rooms, with excellent Wifi access; the unusually complete breakfast (with cold-cuts in addition to the usual cheeses, croissants, yogurt, juices, coffee, cereal, etc... - (I believe no eggs, though). One thing that I didn't see previously mentioned is that there is a convenient self-service laundromat located within a block of the hotel that I would recomend to those that need to wash clothes during their trip. AN ASIDE:There is one thing that I'm somewhat hesitant to comment upon, but am doing so in the hope that it may be of benefit to other gay travelers in Paris. We found that almost everywhere we went (especially subways), that we were greeted with unwelcome, sometimes rude, (uneasy?) stares. Sensitivity to such behavior is, of course, individual, but we were a bit surpised that in a cosmopolitan city such as Paris that we (as a gay couple) would appear to be such 'freaks worthy of notice. Despite this annoyance (which, after all, can be experienced in other parts of the world), we fell in love with Paris ... can 30 million annual visitors to Paris - according to wikipedia - all be wrong? However, I thought I'd just mention this so that others in a similar position are forewarned to this possible reception and can be prepared ahead of time. NOTE: this observation does not apply to the staff at the du Cadran who were all very friendly to us.

<Content>Good value and clean The hotel was very clean, near restaurants and the tower. The front desk staff was helpful and friendly. The only improvement I could suggest is to let the guests know what the bar in the lobby is all about. Can one get a cup of coffee at any time? Is there a charge?

<Content>Loved the Du Cadran Sept 2008 Stayed four nights at the du Cadran - it was wonderful. The hotel staff was great and even found us a hotel room for a night in Chartres. Our superior room was excellent - very clean and nice. There was enough room for the two of us and our luggagge, nice bathroom touches, plus free wifi! The breakfasts were also good - croissants, cheese, lunchmeat, cereals, yogurt, fruit, and cafe au lait. We really liked the location - a short walk to the Eiffel, Seine, and subway stations and inexpensive restaurants on the Rue Cler. Getting around in Paris was quite easy with the subways and trains - but getting a cab was more difficult - you have to call ahead and reserve one. We will definitely stay at the du Cadran for our next stay in Paris. I'm so happy to have found it!

<Content>Would Stay Again In A Heartbeat My wife and I took our honeymoon in Paris and stayed at this charming boutique hotel in the 7th Arrondisement. We could not have been happier with our choice! Hotel du Cadran is in a quiet neighborhood within a short walking distance to Champs de Mars, the Eiffel Tower, Rue Cler and the Ecole Militaire. Many nights my wife and I would walk through the neighborhood looking at the Eiffel Tower.The room was clean and bright. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They were all fluent in English. They actually managed to book us on a van to the airport in the middle of a general transit strike! The lobby was charming and has large windows looking on to a charming side street. The breakfast room is an old cellar with arched ceilings. It was such a great and welcoming space. Breakfast itself was a nice little spread. There was cheese, bread, cereal, milk, juice, coffee, tea, etc. And the best part? When you sit down the attendant places a warm croissant in front of you. It is delicious and the wife and I have been thinking of those croissants ever since we left.I really only have one quibble with the hotel: I wish there were irons and ironing boards in the room. You can borrow one from the front desk, but that's a little annoying. But that's really a minor complaint.We cannot wait to get back to Paris. And when we do, we will stay at Hotel du Cadran!

<Content>Great Hotel in the 7th District We are a couple in our mid 30's travelling with a baby and just spent three nights at the Hotel du Cadran. It was in a great, quiet location just steps from Rue Cler (cute street with cafes, cheese stores, flower shops etc). We booked a superior room with a king sized bed (two twins pushed together) and thought that the room was clean, contemporary and well put together. The room was small (as are all hotel rooms in Paris) but we managed to fit in a small playpen and two suitcases. The bathroom was equally small but recently renovated and very clean. The lobby is in need of a major update but we've heard that renovations will be occuring in November 2008. Overall, had a great experience at this hotel and would recommend it.

<Content>Great location I recently stayed at Hotel du Cadran for 11 nights from July to August 2008. This was a nice hotel, The rooms are quite small which is a given but they were very clean and the beds were comfortable. The staff personnel were friendly, gave good advise for locations to eat, but given that the hotel is situated right around the corner of rue Cler, (the market street) you had some good restaurants at reasonable prices to choose from..Unfortunately the air conditioning in the room made quite the noise and was not very cold even having it at the coolest temperature, and the elevator was out of order everyday for about 2hrs which always seemed to be down when i would come back to the hotel which was a pain as i was on the 5th floor.The price is a bit on the expensive side for what you get in the hotel but the location was great. *5 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and 5 min to Invalides.Safe Travels

<Content>Excellent City Break The hotel is extremely clean and well decorated. We stayed in a twin room which was very small, but this seems to be the norm in Paris. The shower in the bathroom was excellent, the only complaint is that there wasn't any air conditioning in our room. The staff are helpful and speak good English.The Hotel is in a great location, very close the Eiffel Tower and Les Invalides. There is a tube station within a couple of minutes walk which is ideal for exploring the rest of the city.We would definitely stay at the Hotel Cadran again.

<Content>Hotel du Cadran-Paris Gem Hotel du Cadran could not have been better. The location, the room  very nice bathroom and the incredible service we received from the staff was amazing for the price. The staff helped with everything from hard to get restaurant reservations to assisting my nephew with travel plans. The staff was very knowledgeable about the sights in Paris and would call to get information they didn't already know. Laurent was especially helpful. I will definitely return the next time I'm in Paris. (Note: The least expensive rooms are small, but very comfortable and nicely decorated. Two people may want to ask for a slighly larger room.)

<Content>Pity about the great reviews! Chose this hotel because of all the wonderful reviews on Tripadvisor and was really excited about another visit to Paris. However, on arrival we were told that our room was unavailable (sick child - heard it before, must be unlucky!) and we would have to go to a hotel across the road. We ended up really lucky in the Relais Bosquet with a superior room which was huge (unlike the Cadran) and with free breakfast (which we didn't have in Cadran), and where the service was exemplary. Suspect we were moved because others were prepared to pay more! Not a good practice and extremely annoying!

<Content>Great hotel, staff  We found the hotel newly remodeled, very contemporary in design, the beds comfortable, the A/C excellent and the entire property exceptionally clean. The room was a bit small, even when compared to European hotels; however the bathroom was great. The hotel staff is exceptional, eager to help and fluent in English. The staff even helped translate TGV tickets I purchased todetemrine if I could change these. Staff pleasantly handled our last minute request to extend our stay (when they were completely booked) even though it required the juggling of reservations two days in a row and constant checking for cancellations. Finally, when bookings made it impossible to stay longer, the hotel staff located another nice hotel within walking distance, reserved the room and prearranged check in so we did not need to complete a registration form at the second hotel (Hotel Londres Tour Eiffel- also an excellent hotel with charming rooms and an exceptional staff.) I must mention that staff did all the above without any additional inquiry or prompting and kept me regulaly informed. Other requests for directions, taxis and information were handled pleasantly and professionally.The hotel has is excpetionally well located one half block from Rue Cler. Rue Cler is hard to beat. Restaurants (cafes, brasseries, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, crepes and take away) shops (cheese, produce, meat, fish, wine), landromats, a post office and a super marche are all within an easy 5-10 minute walk, mostly on a street with no traffic. The Eiffel Tower is close by (15-20 minutes) as is the MetroI travel more than 200 nights per year on business and have experienced the exceptional and the absolutely awful. I highly recommend this hotel although the rooms are small.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We loved the Hotel De Cadran! The hotel was well positioned to visit all attractions either by foot or by metro (metro nearby). The hotel staff was fantastic and spoke very good English. They also booked us dinner reservations and called for taxis immediately upon request. The room is small compared to US standards but very well maintained. We had a king size bed and not much room surrounding the bed. Although, we were not in the room much, so we did not mind the size. The bathroom was great and spacious. Good products for bath toiletries well stocked each day. We did appreciate the well stocked mini bar upon arrival. They will replenish daily. The maid service is top notch; the room was cleaned very well each day and no issues. The breakfast is quite expensive though and you have several options at a cheaper price surrounding the hotel. A street named Rue Cler is nearby with several restaurants and bistros to choose from. That is also a great street to purchase fresh fruit or pastries.There is a grocery store across the street to purchase less expensive drinks. We purchased and then placed into the mini bar overnight to cool down our drinks. We had no issues with the hotel or staff. They are so friendly and welcome US travelers. A great find.

Staffs speaks good english and friendly, rooms are super modern and clean, although a little bit to the small size.The surrounding is really nice, supermarket is directly opposite to the hotel and there are cafe and restaurant next door. VERY GOOD OVERALL, highly recommended

<Content>Great Hotel Excellent hotel in a great location. The tower was less than a 10 minute walk as was the River, yet the hustle of the tourist stampede was a million miles away from the hotel. Immediately outside the Hotel proved to be a great place to soak up the atmosphere of the Paris we wanted to experience, the place where the Parisians kick back and enjoy good food and wine at very reasonable prices.The rooms in the Hotel were immaculate and decorated to a very high and contemporary standard. Ignore some of the photographs that are still lurking around on the web as these show the Hotel before its makeover. The rooms are compact and perhaps better suited to those tourists that are not of a fuller figure. Glass walls, mirrors, air conditioning, limestone tiles, power shower, mood lighting and chic decor make for a sensual stay; with French doors overlooking the relaxed bistro area.Would we recommend this Hotel? Definitely, and we are looking forward to our next stay there. x

<Content>Fantastic! Beautiful modern rooms and a great location, who could ask for more? The service at the front desk was always helpful and friendly. We had a minor problem with our room, and they went above and beyond to solve the problem, and gave us a bottle of champagne for our trouble. Highly recommended!

<Content>HIdden Gem We read through the reviews on TripAdvisor and chose this hotel from a list for a recent business trip. We were thrilled with our stay because the rooms were modern, clean and newly-upgraded. The A/C was a welcome feature during a week of excessive heat. Just a short walk to the metro stop. The staff was extremely helpful, even walking me and my bags a block when the road was closed by the market on Saturday morning. Keep that in mind if you want to call a taxi! We ate breakfast next store at Cafe du Marche for a much cheaper rate (12 euros for 3 people instead of 13 euros for one in the hotel). One thing to be aware of: taxis are hard to come by. Taxi drivers in the area explain that they no longer go to hotels, so if you need a taxi to pick you up at any time, call ahead and reserve. This works like a charm. The hotel will call a shuttle service, but it is more expensive. The English-speaking taxi reservation phone line is: 01.41.27.66.99. Internet reservations are at www.taxig7.fr You may have to leave a credit card deposit for pick-ups during rush-hour. if you plan on using a credit card to pay, let them know in advance. All in all, the stay at the Hotel du Cadran was highly enjoyable, and we look forward to returning their in the future.

<Content>Fantastic Experience Our experience in Paris was greatly enhanced by our stay at the Hotel du Cadran. The rooms are clean and modern. The staff was very courteous, very friendly and very helpful. The location is convenient to all forms of public transit and many of the most popular sights are within walking range. The neighborhood is noted for the wonderful Rue Cler market but it also is home to many fine restaurants and cafe's. When we return to Paris, we will not hesitate to book a room at the Hotel du Cadran .

<Content>Stylish rooms in a great location We stayed at the recommendation of Rick Steves who always gives great advice. The rooms were quite modern and stylish (albeit small). The hotel has recent;y been renovated by a delightfully playful interior designer. The rooms were a bargain for Paris. The best part was the suberb location from which to explore Paris. It is a block away from the Rue de Cler, the subway, and a bakery which sells transcendental pastries. We had a great five day stay, and would return in a heartbeat.

<Content>Exceptional Service! My husband and I chose this hotel because of its location. Not only was it a perfect location choice, the the service was above and beyond. The receptionist was always very helpful and when there was a problem in our room (minor leak from the ceiling in the bathroom), the hotel staff was extremely attentive and responsive. The rooms are somewhat small, typical of Europe but very modern and clean. There are great restaurants within walking distance and the Rue Cler (open market) is a great experience, expecially in the morning. We will definately stay here again!

<Content>Would Stay Again in a Heatbeat! My son, daughter, mother-in-law and I stayed at the Hotel du Cadran and absolutely loved it!! It is a great location with a short 2 block walk to the metro that will take you everywhere. The Eiffel Tower is a close walk. There are many wonderful cafes and shops close by on the Rue de Cler where you can also purchase picnic items. The hotel staff was very helpful and spoke good English. Our breakfast was included in our room rate and saved us quite a bit of Euros! The cafe' au lait was wonderful along with all the pastries, granola, yogurt, etc . . . The rooms were small but very well decorated in a contemporary theme. The bathrooms were also small but worked out well. We shared a family suite which was basically two rooms with a connecting door. The room with the two twin beds had a bathtub/shower combo. We would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Great Hotel, Excellent Location Great hotel, should be a higher star rating. The hotel is location only a short walk to the Eiffel Tower, it is in safe area with lot of restaurants and shops. My husband and me stayed over two nights in the hotel. The hotel upgrade us free to the jr. suite, it is has a large room/bathroom for Europe. The staff were great, English spoken and helped us with every need. We forget our train tickets, but the hotel found them and make sure we got them back. I would recommend this hotel to anybody, when we travel back to paris, we will staying here again.To help save money, buy breakfood at the local stores and buy metro day pass, to reduce the walking you have to do. Great Paris activity, take some bread, cheese, and couple of bottle of wines and go sit under the eiffel tower at night, a great time!!

<Content>You won't be disappointed Booked on Venere.com. This hotel was an outstanding find. Right off the Rue Cler, close to Metro Station, walk to Eiffel Tower. Modern, quiet and a very helpful and cordial staff. Small room, but very modern and tastefully decorated. I heartily recommend the du Cadran to anyone wanting to stay in the 7th A.

<Content>Excellent Little Hotel Me and my girlfriend stayed here for two nights early in June. This was our first trip to Paris, and we went to do nothing but sightseeing. We therefore wanted a nice hotel in a central location for a decent price. The Hotel du Cadran is exactly this!It is a simple little hotel in a fantastic location. 10 min walk to the Eiffel Tower, and a walkable distance to the Louvre/Musee d'Orsay and Arc de Triomphe. However, it was a bit chilly when we were there so we relied on the Metro (station is 3 mins walk) which is very quick and cheap.The Hotel is located next to a lovely little market street with some great market shops, a bakery and cheese shop nearby and some great restaurants (breakfast at La Petit Cler was fantastic).It was also in the process of being renovated (mostly done I think) most of the work seemed to be downstairs when we were there, so it did not bother us. Plus, this means the room was newly decorated, which was nice, and the bathroom excellent and modern. The rooms are small, and the bathroom will only fit one at a time, but this didn't bother us over two nights.Staff were very helpful and all spoke good English (though a few French courtesies go a long way, especially in restaurants.Definitely would stay again.On a side note, check out the Buddha Bar near the bottom of the Champ d'Elysees (Louvre end) - exceptional food.

<Content>Hotel du Cadran was EXCELLENT!! My wife and I were in Paris for our 25th anniversary and this hotel was just perfect for us. The price included their excellent breakfast along with a 2-day museum pass. The room was small but having been to Europe before, this is to be expected. We were upgraded at no charge. Loved the location. Price very competitive when considering breakfast and museum pass. Would definitely recommend.

<Content>Immerse yourslef like a Parisian in this terrific hotel We had a wonderful experience at Hotel Du Cadran. The room was newly renovated and, although small, made excellent use of available space, and was surprisingly uncluttered, even with multiple travel suitcases. It was very smartly designed, with a flat screen television, sophisticated multi-port lighting system, and contemporary bathroom. The location was absolutely perfect. We walked to most major tourist sites and museums, and when our feet failed us, the L'Ecole Militaire Metro stop was 3 minutes away. The shops and eateries on Rue Cler supplied the most delicious, cost-effective breakfasts every day. Bread, cheese, wine and fruit were all right outside the door. We highly recommend this hotel to future travelers.

<Content>good Hotel good Hotel half way between Invalides and Eiffel Tower. Newly renovated room, very slick , very high tech looking. Room are average size for Paris and within this price range.Bedding may be a little to firm for my testy hipbone but the accomodations are a sure bet if you are staying in Paris. You are steps away from a magnificient bakery, traiteur, and cheese store. Rooms are well equiped an the king size bed very appreciated.The breakfast is served downstair in a very lovely vaulted old stone room and for the price of $13 Euro you get a good complete breakfast with all the coffee refills you want. (the dollar is very low but the value is still there because a cafe creme in Paris costs 4 euro on average and no refills), so take advantage of breakfast and then start wondering in the world ,and explore the gay Paris. Nothing to do with the Hotel but parisians on the left bank are a little snoody and stuffy. Don't let that offend you. It is the nature of the beast.Will stay in this Hotel again and will recommend

<Content>Honeymoon in Paris! We have just spent the first five nights of our honeymoon in the Hotel Du Cadran. The hotel is currently being remodeled, but they have finished with the rooms portions. While working in the lobby you do have to pass through a bit of a mess and it was unfortunate that this was not communicated to us prior to arrival. Still, our stay wasmagnificent. The brand new renovated rooms are modern, the beds are large and comfortable, the bathrooms are impecable and have all the amenities for a very comfortable stay. We had an incident where the elecricity blew out due to an unknown circumstance and damaged my husband's electric shaving machine as well as our cell phone charger. The owner insisted that it was our things that blew up a feuse (is that how one writes it?) and she was not responsible. Still, she gave us another cell phone charger that does not even work. We had to go and spend 60 Euro to replace what was broken.Proxemity to everything, the street perpendicular to rue du champs de mars where the hotel is situated is gorgeous. full of restaurants and markets and flowers. true parisian experience.

<Content>Painfully Small **Bigger is Better...We had read that it was small but weren't prepared for the size and inconvenience of the rooms. I was on submarines in the Navy and had more storage room! even some well placed hooks would have helped. **Staff...I am not sure who the people were talking to when they talked about the friendly staff. I would rate this one in the lower tier of my European travel experiences. They weren't necessarily unfriendly but they didn't seem happy to work there and you had to ask for everything. I wanted to bring a cup of coffee up to my room and that set off a rash of phone calls and they weren't sure what to do. Finally they decided that if I did it again I would need to buy the complete breakfast-hardly a rationale outcome. **Construction Update...As for the construction activity they started on the top(5) floor and are working their way down. They are now on Floor 1, so most of the rooms you would get are now the newer rooms they show on the website. They are trying to make them slick and modern but instead have made them slick and impractical. It's a little noisy during the day but not unbearable. Try to stay as high up as you can because the lobby is next! **Summary...The only thing this hotel has going for it is location. It is throwing distance from Rue Cler so that was very convenient for us. We would not stay here again. There are other hotels in the neighborhood that are better-Valadon, Muget, and Champs du Mars among them.

<Content>Great experience overall GOOD:- Excellent location for sightseeing. The Eiffel Tower is just a short walk away, a choice of Metro stations nearby, and you can also explore the Paris sights as you walk the Seine.- Excellent location for food. There are tons of cafes and restaurants just around the corner along Rue Cler. Despite the activity, its not a noisy area. - Clean surroundings. The user pictures here give an accurate representation of the room conditions. Decor was tasteful and felt pretty French to me. One of the users got a flat screen TV -- I didn't, and the BBC channel was not working so I had no English media whatsoever.- Room size. I had a corner room and it didn't feel small at all. Had about 2 feet between the wall and the bed, so there was space to move and stand by the windows.- Nice staff. Very enthusiastic and friendly. See below.NOT SO GOOD:- Thin doors, I could feel my neighbour closing his door.- Construction work. Did not bother us much, but the builders use the same lift. I do not remember too much noise, except for the occassional drilling on one morning. But why spend your visit to Paris in the room anyway?!Like I said, overall it was a good experience. The staff were also very helpful, I emailed them to confirm my booking and they responded quickly to my query. While we were staying there, we asked for their recommendation on a good place for French onion soup. They suggested the cafe across the road, which unfortunately was closed since it was a Sunday (do try it out and let me know!). Anyway, they called up another restaurant nearby and booked us a table straight away. I am not sure if they honestly booked a good restaurant or if they received some sort of 'referral commission' from that, but I was touched by their gesture. And, the meal was superb!

<Content>comfortable accomodations in downtown Paris We stayed in this hotel for few days in January 2008. The hotel is divided in two parts: Recently furnished rooms and old rooms. We had one in each part. I would advice you modern rooms for the small price difference. They are realy well decorated. Great location and friendly stuff. We will come back.

<Content>Construction going on at this hotel HI  We just stayed here 2 weeks ago. Great location. A few blocks from the Metro. Around the corner from the Rue Cler Market. In walking distance of the Eiffel Tower.  Staff spoke English and were very willing to assist in anyway they could.  We had a double room. Very small. Tiny amount of space between wall and foot of the bed and wall and one side of the bed.  Room was clean., We had a view of the top of the Eiffel Tower.  There is no shower curtain, only a small 1/4 glass wall.  Bathroom was modern.  Just beware they are doing construction from early morning on some of the floors. It was very loud mid day when we stopped back at the hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We loved the Du Cadran! The staff were simply excellent and extremely helpful. The price was right for such a great location!! The rooms were small, as are most in Paris, but well designed, very clean , and newly renovated on the floor we stayed The staff actually upgraded us to the newer rooms just because they had one available. The lobby was quaint and the surrounding shops were lovely with a bakery and cheese shop on the same street. We were just a few minutes from the Eiffel Tower. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay there again in the future. C'est Magnifique!!

<Content>What a Surprise Location, Location, Location! This hotel is in a fantastic area of Paris, close to everything, and the open air market is less than a minute walk. Mornings start with fresh from the oven pastries, wonderful coffee, and a market where you can order a custom crepe, any fresh fruit, or sit down at a number of restuarants. Two grocery stores are available and the evening cafes are incredible with good food at good prices. the neighborhood is very well kept.The hotel was the best surprise of all. Yes, they are under renovation, a soft well-planned renovation. The renovated rooms rival any boutique hotel. The rooms are small when to compared to our American standards, but the design is incredible. Crisp, extremely clean, and equipped with all of the gadgets to make you realize that thought for comfort was certainly the number one consideration. The rooms were elegant and artistic, this may be one of the best kept secrets.Staff was friendly, and the manager Carol was exceptional in her commitment to customer satisfaction. We were on our Honeymoon on this trip and the Hotel Du Cadran, was one of the experiences that made our stay remarkable. Being a seasoned traveler I do not have a single hesitation in recommending this hotel and would be the first choice on our return.

<Content>Miniature offering My wife and I booked a superior room for the weekend. Our room was on the 5th floor. Apparently it was a superior double. The positives : great quiet location, clean , tidy , well lit and had a flat screen tv...all very nice.BUT... it was so small. We literally had 50cms around our bed to change etc and by the time you had stowed away your bags there wasn't any room to function properly.Parisians will tell you that these sized rooms have a certain charm to them and are typically 7me arrondissement but no this was a joke. We asked to see other rooms but true enough we had one of the better ones so we were stuck (although we did contemplate changing our hotel as this was so bad).We got used to the room and after a while it became a laugh but only in the knowledge that we would never never go there again. It might be bearable as a business traveller on your own for a night but longer than this or two sharing forget it.Shame really.

<Content>I loved it ! First, I would like to disagree with the comment below that I find unjustified and instead congratulate the whole staff for a lovely stay. Merci. I booked at le Cadran after reading all the good reviews of the previous guests and was looking to visit. Everything was as expected : Le Cadran is a charming little hotel with an excellent location and being so close to the Invalides and the Eiffel Tower, both walking distance from the hotel as well as the lovely Rue Cler with its village atmosphere and its mouth-watering shops was great ! The reception staff was fluent in English, polite and always eager to help with all my queries. The Buffet Breakfast was served into the lovely cellar vault downstairs and I found it very good.Regarding the room, it was pristine, comfortable and of normal size by European standard. I must say that these renovated rooms pictured on some of the reviews look state of the art. I will recommend Le Cadran to all my friends.

<Content>Great Location and Service I stayed at this hotel with my 10 year old daughter for 5 days - wonderful service, clean room, and large bathroom by European standards. The staff spoke English, which helped, although I understand French when spoken. The location is excellent - about 2 blocks from Ecole Militarie stop and an easy walk to the Tour Eiffel. Having the street market right there (Rue Cler) was fabulous - we had crepes for breakfast and stocked up on our way home for dinner with fresh croissant, fruit and cheese. There's a post office on the corner near the metro, and several supermarkets on the Rue. We also did quite a bit of walking to destinations from this hotel. CNN is the only English station on TV, but we rented a DVD from a place around the corner one evening.

<Content>Decent (but not great) Hotel in Good Location We stayed at the Hotel du Cadran this past weekend, and were very thankful for its location near the Eiffel Tower and shopping areas because the Paris transit strikes cut off any metro access. The room was very clean (though tiny! and a bit sparse) and staff friendly. However, some things to note that I felt were missed since so many others gave glowing reviews and rated a 5: 1) Definitely cannot see the Eiffel Tower. In fairness, we did have a low room, but I would doubt any room could see the tower...or maybe just a piece of it. It is very close walking distance, but several streets away so many buildings between. I wasn't expecting to see it, but just don't be fooled by the name. 2) LOTS of construction noise. They are apparently renovating the rooms which is a good thing, but we were awoken on Saturday morning around 8am to constant loud noise (definitely on our floor). 3) Public areas very dated. The English guidebooks in the lounge area definitely helped, but compared to other 3 star hotels we walked by, this lounge area was definitely in need of updating. All in all, it was a fine stay for a weekend but I would not likely go back - I know Paris is expensive but this was still over 140 EUR a night and I think we could have done better.

<Content>great stay at the Hotel du Cadran Spent three nights at the Hotel Du Cadran in July of 2007. We had booked two interconnecting rooms, as we were a family of four travelling together. Upon checking in, the interconnecting rooms weren't available, but we were across the hall from one another. The desk staff was extremely apologetic, and upon arriving in our rooms we found a note apologizing along with bon-bons for the kids and a bottle of champagne for us!Breakfast every morning was wonderful. The croissants are unbelievable. Our rate also included museum passes which was huge given the crowds in July.I would stay at this hotel again if going back to Paris.

<Content>Excellent hotel near Eiffel and Rue Cler We stayed at this hotel for one night in Oct. The girls at the reception were very friendly and helpful, especially, Emilie. The location is within walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and half a block to the Rue Cler, the charming residential district with open air markets. What a treat to stay in this location at a great price--140 Euro.

<Content>Great little place Stayed at Du Cadran in October 2007 for 3 nights and found it to be charming. First impressions were good. The lobby was lovely and very clean and the lady behind reception was very nice and cheerful (as were all of the staff). Check-in was simple and hassle free. We read on here that the rooms were small and it was. However, it was more than adequate and kept very clean and tidy for all 4 days. The bathroom was an excellent size and had everything required.We particularly liked the breakfast room in the cellar (don't worry, it has been renovated!) It had a chilled out atmosphere and the food was excellent. It made a refreshing change from the scrum at the Disney hotel for the previous 2 days.Location was brilliant. Handily placed for The Eiffel Tower and a nice walkable distance from the Arc d'Triomphe/Champs Elysee.Overall we had a fantastic holiday and would highly recommend Paris and the Du Cadran to anyone.

<Content>Charming Hotel The staff at the Hotel du Cadran was always so pleasant and helpful ,from making dinner reservations to hiring a car to meet us at the airport. The room was small but newly remodeled, very clean and we even had a view of the Eiffel Tower. The location near Rue Cler is perfect and the metro stop is just two blocks away. Our stay in Paris was wonderful and the hotel and it's kind staff was a bonus. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in a small neighborhood hotel, in a safe and charming area.

<Content>Great value, central convenience. Stayed 2 nights, first week, in May 2007. I've stayed in Paris at other similar-sized properties by Madelene and Invalides. Cadran is my favorite, at much less cost, better location, close to Metro Ecole Militaire and Rue Cler. Room size compared with more expensive hotels at a fraction of cost. Ours had a little enclosed patio. We don't hang out in the rooms much, so I appreciate the friendly and business-like service and proximity to everything by Metro. Booked directly online with hotel at a great use it or lose it special rate available at this time of year. Confirmed promptly by staff. If $$ is no object, there are plenty of alternatives for you. Room was small, clean and compared very well with pricier hotels, as mentioned earlier. Great neighborhood area. I'll stay again.

<Content>Great location; extremely pleasant stay. This pleasant hotel is in a great location- safe, easy to walk to sites, close to restaurants and shops. Just as important, the beds and pillows were very comfortable and our room was quiet and dark at night which made for great sleeping. The staff was very helpful and the breakfast was good and convenient. We'll definitely return.

<Content>Great location Small hotel in a very good location. We got stuck on the ground floor behind reception with no key (the previous occupants had taken it with them).Room was clean and presentable. As others have mentioned it was a little small, but I don't see this as a negative thing.There were shutters on the windows and being a ground floor room we had to keep the shutters closed to maintain our privacy. This in turn meant we had no natural light coming in.The location is wonderful, the Eiffel Tower is very close, as is a Metro stop - so you can get around easily.

<Content>sweet little hotel stayed here April 06, hotel staff so sweet, a friend decided to join us and they added a cot, and when they forgot the night we arrived, they gave us a second room that night until morning to move the cot, rooms are small but bath is terrific, the Ru Cler right out the door was a safe area with lots of shops. staff helped out when my friend lost her wallet, made the local calls and we were able to retrieve it! for my sons first trip to paris it was an excellent choice!

<Content>Great Stay - Great Location Had this hotel reccomended by a friend who had stayed both 1 and 2 years previously. It was exactly as we had expected and we were extremely pleased with the choice. Location is superb - handy for Metro stops, cafe's  restaurants, riverside  proximity to get to all locations. Nice to walk past the tower when venturing out and back in a day. Rooms a little small, and slightly dated (but refurbishment of all romms is in progress now until the end of '07), but clean and served a purpose. A Value for money hotel, with Air-com - much needed in the middle of summer. Friendly and helpful staff. Top-tip - don't have the breakfast - eat at the cafe next door, for less.

<Content>Shabby Hotel but Great Service We booked 3 rooms for 5 days in May. When we arrived, I was very disappointed in the hotel lobby. The leather sofas were cracked and worn and the whole room looked disshelved. All 3 bedrooms were extremely small, which we expected, but my husband and I could not even pass each other in the room. The furniture was very worn, the beds were practically on the floor, and overall, no ambiance. However, the bathrooms were modern and very nice. The only reason to stay at this hotel is the service and location. All the staff was very helpful. The front desk was attentive and very nice to help with questions, reservations, calling taxis, etc. One day after sight-seeing all day, I came back to my room to find my bottle of white wine on ice by the head housekeeper. What a nice surprise! The neighborhood, Rue Cler, is absolutely fabulous. My husband and I both agreed that when we return to Paris, we will definitely stay in the Rue Cler again but probably choose a different hotel. The hotel is in the midst of renovation and they had a photograph of what the renovated rooms will look like and they will be ultra modern which is not in keeping with this old hotel. So, for that reason, we will look at other hotels in the area next time.

<Content>Good central Paris hotel I stayed at the Hotel du Cadran for three nights in mid July. Found this little hotel to be a good base for exploring central Paris, being close to a lot of the sights and with good cafes and restaurants in the surrounding streets. I originally booked a twin room but was able to change on arrival to a double which looked out over the main street. Room was very clean and comfortable. During my stay there was some top floor refurbishment work going on during the day time so if you are planning a stay soon and intending on sleeping late, you might want to check if this is now complete. Overall found the hotel to be reasonable value for money (~ 鈧?00 per night) and given its proximity to many of the sights provided a good location for checking out central Paris.

<Content>Ok stay.... Stayed here for a week. Contacted the hotel directly and was able to get free breakfast thrown into our package (normally 10 euros per person). The breakfast was just fine w/ us - bread, cheese, croissants, cereal, etc. We were very worried because we had heard the hotel would be undergoing renovations at this time, but all that was going on was the top floor was being painted. Room was an ok size - desk, king bed, closet and enough room to put our 2 suitcases.Pros: Quiet, friendly staff, decent breakfast, good proximity to Eiffel Tower and short walk to Ecole Militaire metro stopCons: Leaky a/c  leaky sink (they did fix these problems), toilet was running (even after they though they fixed it), bed was hard, only English TV was CNN international (not that we expected any more than that), not really any night time entertainment in this area

<Content>Charming Boutique Hotel We stayed in this small but charming boutique hotel and were very satisfied with all the amenities. Our room was small but very clean and neat. The bathroom had plenty of hot water in the shower with good water pressure. The beds were comfortable - not luxurious. The staff cleaned and freshened up the room daily. The breakfast buffet in the lower level had plenty of choices and was well stocked. It was open early and late enough to accomodate eating any time of the morning. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful - from making a pot of tea for us in the afternoon, to resolving a booking problem with a tour we had scheduled, to suggesting sights to visit during our stay. They all spoke English very well. The location was perfect - 2 blocks to the Eiffel Tower, a few steps to the lively and well known market street, Rue Du Clef, with restaurants, a patisserie, an ATM machine, and other charming shops. The metro stop was a 5 minute walk away. The neighborhood was quiet and there were no disturbances at night even with the windows open. There is also access to the internet in the lobby. I would visit this hotel again.

<Content>Great location A nice 2** hotel in a great location. Upon arrival there was no water in the hotel and the elevator wasn't working due to repairs That inconvenience only lasted a few hours. We were given room 504 whcih is a very small corner room. The air conditioner wasn't working iand the room was extremely hot. We requested to be moved after the 1st night as the room was 27C. We were moved to a room on the 2nd floor that had air conditioning that worked. Once moved no further problems. Staff were friendly and assisted re transportaion, dinner reservations. Rooms were clean and the bed reasonably comfortable. Would recommend, but try not to stay on the 5th floor where the rooms are smaller.

<Content>Good Value I can only add what others have said regarding this small hotel. We just returned from a four night stay. First of all, the staff is etremely nice and polite and all requests are seriously considered and met. The rooms are small but then that's Europe, especially Paris where space is at a premium. Yes, the rooms are a bit worn but then there is a renovation in the works t according to the photo in the lobby and the room we saw(courtesy of housekeeping) it will be ultra contemporary (alas paris seems to be going that way). however, that's the slightly downside. The location is perfect, the rooms are clean with nice amenties and our room had a view of the top half of the Eifel Tower. For pricey Paris, thought we got an ok deal with breakfast (which is very good) and a two day museum pass. It is a slight walk from the metro but then don't even consider Paris if you don't like to walk. There are at least four excellent restaurants within a two minute walk from the front door of the hotel (We heartedly recommend the La Petite Nicose) All in all, a nice stay. Do have to add with a bit of a chuckle because it always seems to be the case, the rooms are not exaclt as they appear on the website.

<Content>Very Enjoyable!!! My girlfriend and I stayed at the Cadran for a week in early March 2007. I have to say I was very impressed. The location was excellent. The hotel is situated within a two minute walk to L鈥?Ecole Militaire metro station. You could walk to the Champ de Mars and get a great view of the Eiffel Tower within ten minutes. We would often walk to see it lit up at night. It was so good having this icon so close. In fact all the great sights were within about a 30 minute walk of the hotel. However my favourite and lasting memory was the Cadran鈥檚 proximity to Rue Cler. The fresh food markets on Rue Cler were so fantastic. We sampled everything from crepes, to cheeses, wine and bread. I felt we had the ultimate Parisian experience right at our doorstep. There were also a number of nice bars and restaurants around the area. The staff at the Cadran were friendly (with one exception) and knowledgeable. The rooms were not enormous but I thought were good quality for the price. Unfortunately our bath plug was faulty so we couldn鈥檛 have baths but that is a minor complaint. Another minor problem was the air-conditioning. The room was quite hot at night and the air-conditioning didn鈥檛 seem to work. The stay was also somewhat marred by the arrogance of one staff member, a grumpy old man, who was on reception the night before we left. We had paid to use the internet for half an hour, however 5 minutes into our session the hotel computer crashed. When I went and told the grumpy old man what had happened his response was: 鈥淪o what do you want me to do about it鈥? I had never experienced such rudeness our entire stay and found his attitude very frustrating. We explained that we needed him to re-enter the password into the computer. However he was still too lazy to do his job, so he gave me the password, 鈥淐ADRAN鈥? So if you do stay here give that password a try for some free internet time. Also on our final day, our stay was further marred by the airport pick up service that the hotel had arranged. Our car failed to turn up. This probably was not the fault of the hotel, but I remain slightly sceptical. But enough of the negatives. In all it was a very positive experience staying here. I loved it and would definitely stay again despite the minor problems.

<Content>Great hotel but a word of warning... We stayed here for 4 nights from 26th April 2007 and can only add to the glowing reviews with regards to the quality and location of the hotel but with the following proviso, of note particularly for visitors thinking of staying here before May next year. The amenities state that the hotel has air conditioning but does NOTsay that it is only on during the summer months - May to September! During our stay the room temperature never dropped below 28C but staff were adamant that it could not be turned on before the usual date as it was controlled via an external source. As there was a heatwave on we found the nights particularly uncomfortable and may not have stayed here had we known about the restrictions. Otherwise we would really recommend this place and would stay here again (between May and September!).

<Content>Weekend Break We stayed at the hotel du cadran between the 20 April- 23rd April for a long weekend. We had a lovely time in Paris visting all the famous landmarks. The hotel was above average for a 3 star hotel because everything was provided within the hotel. The hotel was within walking distance to the metro and local buses. Bus tickets and metro tickets are really cheap I would advice you to boy a carnet of 10 tickets. All famous landmarks are in close proximity to the hotel which is an advantage. It is situated within a quite area. There are plenty of places to choose to eat as well as a local market on your door step. The staff were really welcoming. The room was compact room and could have been a little bit larger. A large range of food is provided at breakfast for those staying bed and breakfast.

<Content>The Best Parisien Experience! We have just returned from a mid-week stay at the Hotel Du Cadran in Paris.This hotel was absolutely fantastic. There was nothing particularly fancy about it, however the location was ABSOLUTELY SUPERB, the room was fantastically clean, the staff were so very helpful, nothing was too much trouble.The room was of a relatively small size, but then they generally are in Paris. The mini-bar was also very reasonably priced. All of the major sights were within easy reach, the Eiffel Tower only a 7-8 minute walk from the hotel. Everywhere else is also within reasonable walking distance, however the Metro system is invaluable in getting around the city easily and cheaply. A ticket costs about 1Euro 80 and is valid on any line for 2 hours after purchase. I would strongly recommend the Lonely Planet guide to Paris as this has very easy to decipher Metro maps as well as excellent general info on the city.We had an absolutely fabulous time in Paris and it is a trip that I will remember fondly.

<Content>Great Stay We have just returned from a 3 night stay mid week after the easter holiday, and can not fault the location, service or cleanliness of the Hotel and the room. Though close to the Eiffel Tower and several cafe's the noise was at a minimum even with the windows having to be open due to the hot weather. the beds are firm, but if it's what you are used to then they are fine and we slept well. Especially after a meal out and a sampling of the wine from the various restaurants and cafes nearby. The staff are friendly and speak excellent English. breakfast is Continental but there is plenty to choose . The Hotel is Great for the Tower and the major sites, and we had a view of the top of the Tower from the bedroom. The rooms are compact but why go to Paris If you intend to sleep all day? Get out and see the great sights of the city. I would not hesitate to stay here again and recommend the Hotel to anyone.

<Content>Springtime In Paris Spending Easter in Paris in itself is a wonderful experience. Adding to the Parisian delights is this delicate hotel, 10 mins walk from the Eiffel tower (which follows you wherever you go) and situated within easy reach of the metro meaning you have access to all areas! The hotel staff were fabulous, recommending places to go and are on hand 24/7.The rooms, although small were immaculate with clean linen each day and a fully stocked, extremely reasonable mini-bar. They supply maps,reading material and a corkscrew if you get stuck!There is a fabulous patisserie at the end of the street and the bar across the way serves ice cold, very welcome mojitos which at the endof day spent walking around the streets of Paris come highly recommended.C'est tres formidable with the want to return - soon!

<Content>Excelent value We were a party of four and have just returned from a short midweek break to Paris .We all agreed the hotel was good value, clean, well appointed and friendly with a good breakfast.It is well situated in a reasonably quiet area a short walk from the Tower and within easy reach of the Bus, Metro and water Taxi's if required. A choice of good resturants and food shops are close by.We would not hesitate to use again.

<Content>Just OK Just go back from Hotel Du Cadran. It's very basic but clean. However, the rooms are small but so are most in France. The bed was hard as a rock and very low to the floor. Very uncomfortable. TV was on a 13 but if you don't speak French, CNN and the BBC are your only English choices anyway. The people are very nice. The hotel offers 2 day Musuem passes includdes Versailles. Well worth it. The location is wonderful. Very central to everything and a full selection of markets, cafes, pasterries, etc. They claim they are updating there rooms soon. If so, this is a great place and location.

<Content>Great hotel for a short weekend! Hotel du Cadran is a great place for a long weekend holiday with husband or girlfriend. We especially liked being so close to the Metro, the wonderful markets on Rue de Cler (great olive oi store!) and the restaurants and bistros close by when we didn't want to venture out any further. Hotel is very easy to get to by Metro from Gard du Nord. The hotel has a very friendly staff who are eager to help you, breakfast fills you up, and it's a great place for women to stay who are traveling alone. I went with a girlfriend this time but my husband will come with me the next time so it's nice for couples, too. If you're not looking for a fancy place but clean (and a great shower!), close to restaurants and transportation, this is the place. I highly recommend!

<Content>Hotel du Cadran, Paris Nice hotel in a great location. The rooms were not large but clean and comfortable, we were out most of the time anyway. I noticed at reception that the rooms were due for renovation, the bedrooms were a little tired and out of date. The bathroom was very clean and there was lots of hot water and a great shower. We had asked for a room with a view and were a little disappointed not to get this. We were given Room 407 (superior, king size) which was at the back of the hotel with no view but it was very quiet- which was good. There was lots of choice at breakfast tea, coffee, fruit juice, various cereals, youghurt, fruit, jam,cheese and ham. There was also plenty of toast, french bread and of course fresh croissants. Our breakfast was included in the price of our stay. There are a few supermarkets nearby and lots of cafes and restaurants, though we mainly ate at night in the Latin Quarter which had lots of choice, nice food and cheaper menus than elsewhere. The only down side of our visit to Paris was the number of homeless people living rough, especially on the banks of the Seine. There seemed to be people begging at all the tourist spots and we were constantly warned about pick-pockets. Watch out for the oh, I have just found this gold ring, could you give me money for it if I give it to you. You have been warned, please be very careful!

<Content>Nice Surprise! I booked this hotel via the Eurostar website for my birthday weekend in Paris after reading the reviews, and was pleased with my experience there. My first preference when choosing a hotel in Paris was location and cleanliness- both of which was perfect! It was in short walking distance from the Eiffel Tower, Louvre, etc. and right near a metro station. The hotel staff was helpful and spoke English back to my broken french and held our bags after check out so that we could walk around the city before we caught the Eurostar back to London. The room/bathroom was small, but I had been warned that Parisian hotels were. The hotel breakfast was fine for what we needed. I am going to book there again for my next trip!

<Content>Perfect for single woman I have stayed in many little three-star hotels around Paris, and found this one to be the best value due to it's location, cleanliness, helpful staff, and tasteful, well-equipped room. The tea kettle and biscuits are a nice touch. The breakfast room is very charming and they provide a very good continental breakfast. The lift wasn't working for half of my stay, but they assured me it was being fixed once and for all. They did carry my suitcase down the stairs when I left without any grumbling. I like the location for easy access to a couple of good cafe's and grocery shops. When I traveling solo, I don't like to be out much after dark, but here you can easily eat a nice dinner a few steps from the hotel or buy food items while you're out during the day for a bed picnic. Rue Cler nearby is a walking street full of shops and restaurants.

<Content>Do not hesitate to patronize this wonderful establishment! My entire family stayed at the Hotel du Cadran for New Year's and we could not have been happier with the accomodations or the personal and professional service of the staff. The front desk attendants, in particular, were exceptionally helpful, patient, and kind. The breakfast was delicious and situated in a lovely and ambient dining location. The location of the hotel was fabulous, too . . . near the Eiffel Tower and close to many delicious restaurants, markets, and cafes. The rooms were beautiful, nicely appointed, and more than adequately sized. All together, a wonderful trip; do not hesitate to patronize this exceptional establishment!

<Content>Outstanding location/staff We've been to France/Europe many times in the past 10 years, and this was one of the best 'in-city' hotels for the price. Not luxury - but very clean and extremely well placed near the market. Easy walk to Metro, numerous nice restaurants and between two parks. The staff was fantastic, particularly when attempting to return a rental car at rush hour. We highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Charming Hotel in a Great Neighborhood We were only able to spend two nights in Paris, prior to a 14-day European cruise - but of the 9 countries and 14 cities we visited during our nearly 3 week tour of Europe, Paris has got to be our favorite - and the Hotel du Cadran has a lot to do with it! The location is absolutely the best. We walked to the Eiffel Tower, Invalides, Rodin Museum, the Champs Elysses, and the Arc de Triomphe. But always felt so comfortable when returning to our neighborhood around the hotel. There are actually too many wonderful boulangeries and patisseries nearby! (Too much temptation!) And everything I read on Trip Advisor about the hotel staff is absolutely true....Emilie is a jewel. Speaks perfect English and is always happy to help in any way she can, from marking directions on a map to confirming tour reservations and making arrangements for airport transportation. Yes, our room was small, but we didn't spend any more time there than just to sleep and get ready for the next day's adventure. And the croissants at breakfast are without a doubt the best we've ever tasted. Yes, they serve you one - but will bring you as many as you like upon request. There was some confusion as to whether or not the breakfast was included in the price. We thought it was included, but learned upon checkout that we would have to pay 10 euros each. Just confirm upon check-in whether or not your rate includes breakfast - we failed to do this. We would definitely return to the Cadran!

<Content>Lovely people/Lovely hotel Due to a glitch in our travel plans, we had an extra night in Paris. (How bad could that be??) We were fortunate that the hotel had a room available and found it to be lovely and convenient. The people speak excellent English (and don't mind doing so); the hotel was lovely and our room was more than adequate (we did like having the tea kettle). Breakfast is served in a vaulted basement room...plenty of coffee, juice, etc.We would most certainly stay here again and would recommend it to anyone. JGD

<Content>Service  We weren't sure what to expect, however upon our arrivel we were pleasantly surprised, to say the least.The young woman at the desk gave us recommendations for places to have dinner - the place she especially liked was a HUGE HIT (La Litote around the corner - more incredible service  wonderfully inventive  fresh dishes) She also booked a night tour of the city for us and called to tell the restaurant we needed to be finished by a certain time to make the tour.Our entire stay the service  friendliness were ABOVE  BEYOND what we have come to expect in the travels and places we have stayed - business and personal.My husband  I would HIGHLY recommend the Hotel du Cadran to anyone. Not only is the service fantastic, but the location is charming ( more residential and fresh food markets on cobbled streets - great little shops I managed to spend $ at as well!!)  central (walking distance to Eiffel Tower)When I wasn't given a receipt at a shop, one of the yound ladies wrote a note for me that explained that I needed a receipt for the purchase to have when I went through customs to go home ... she actually wrote the note and it made it so easy to go back to the shop owner - who couldn't speak english - and have the receipt made up.The staff at Hotel du Cadran made staying in a foreign country easier. They gave directions, held our luggage, wrote notes, booked reservations ...... and were SINCERLY friendly and happy to be of service to us every step of the way !!!!Thank you - we will be back one day Stephanie  Ken LeachCalgary, AlbertaCanada

<Content>The Main Reason Our Stay in Paris Was So Great We chose l'Hotel du Cadran because of all the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. The hotel lived up to its reviews and more. The staff is wonderful, and they all speak English. I appreciated their responses in French, when I tried my French. It helped improve my pronounciation.The location is superb -- quiet, charming, within easy walking distance of the Eiffel and the Seine, and a ten second walk to Rue Cler. Part of Rue Cler -- the part closest to the hotel -- is a pedestrian area, with restaurants, small shops, including grocery stores, bakeries, pastry shops, and more. We ate all our dinners, had our mid-afternoon crepe, picked up a freshly made sandwich from an outdoor shop on our first day in Paris, and picked up a very good bottle of wine for 1,89 euro -- all on Rue Cler. The nearest metro stop is only a couple of minutes away, but the Rodin museum and Napolean's Tomb were so close, we didn't need the metro to see them.Our room was smaller than a typical American motel room, but certainly fine for the two of us with our three pieces of luggage. It had a king-size bed, its own AC, a bathroom with shower, and a closet. Everything was very clean, and well maintained. We were quite comfortable for the four nights we were in Paris. Most importantly, we slept well, because the hotel, and the surrounding streets were very quiet, all night long.When we go to Paris again, we won't consider any other hotel.Mr. and Mrs. Morris

<Content>A great little hotel for a short break Review by: Mr and Mrs Edwards, Essex, England.We stayed there for a 3-night break in early September. It's clean, and the staff are very very helpful. The rooms are not over-large, but for a short break as tourists, what do you want ? Its value for money, and we found it ideal. The local area surrounding the hotel is great - plenty of good value cafes/restaurants/bars within easy walking distance and it's in a quiet area, so sleeping at night is no problem, unlike a lot of Parisian city areas. A metro station is very close by, as is the Open Top sightseeing bus route. The Eiffel Tower is a 10 minute walk away, and we would seriously recommend the Towers' night-time, on the hour, light show. It is dazzling.

<Content>Still a good choice Stayed here a few years ago and liked the hotel, neighborhood. Upon return in June, found the hotel to still be clean, comfortable (decent sized room for Paris), quiet and friendly, and the neighborhood is still interesting, good restaurants, convenient to metro, nice to walk around. If you want a touristic area, this is not the best choice; if you like the idea of being where Parisians live and work, but with a bit of extra at a reasonable price, it is very good choice.

<Content>great location, but terrible accomodations for people travelling with children The hotel is well located, but I wouldn't recommend it to any couple nor family. Only the loner traveller will find it enjoyable. The rooms were the smallest I had never seen.

<Content>Fantastic! We stayed at this hotel August 6-11th. I have got to say that if you cannot afford to stay at George V (where I always get my hair done when in Paris) then this is THE hotel to stay at. We arrived a few hours early and we were checked in immediately as the room was already prepared. The front desk staff is the friendliest and nicest and always ready to help with anything. Karen, Emily, and Sonya (and Gabriel the late night desk clerk) were the greatest! They arranged to have someone pick us up at the airport, made restaurant reservations for us, and gave us info and help for just about anything we needed. They spoke perfect English and I learned so much about how to get around in Paris from them. And you can order Louvre tickets and the Paris hop on/hop off bus tickets right there at the front desk and save a lot of time! Also, the location is great - only a 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. My son even did laundry at the lav-o-matic around the corner - the washers cost but the dryers are free. The neighborhood has little markets, restaurants, etc. - VERY convenient. The hotel room was a decent size for a boutique hotel - In other words, we could unpack our suitcases and leave them sit out, not all scrunched up as in other boutique hotels. And the bathroom was just like being in an American hotel - very nice and roomy with lots of amenities, even shoe shine sponges. The air conditioning and everything worked great. The lobby is so nice and cozy and they have books and games sitting out and a little bar - it is just like being in your own den back home. My family will always stay at this hotel now that we have discovered it. It is the best.

<Content>Loved Du Cadran! We had a great time at Hotel Du Cadran. the staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were extremely clean, especially the bathrooms. The hotel is in an excellent location, walking distance to the Eifel Tower, as well as the metro and good restaurants. I would definitely recommend a stay there, and would go there again on our next vacation.

<Content>friendly convenient The location was good. The single room was ok: very clean although the walls need redecoration. Cheap but decent furniture. Very clean bathroom: plenty of towels and soap, shampoo and shower gel.Breakfast nothing special: juices, cafe, cereal, jam, bread and one croissant.

<Content>Made our Trip Pleasant The rooms are small, but VERY VERY clean. The staff at the hotel is charming, nice, and willing to do anything for you. They advise on where to go, when, and by what means. The biggest pluses for this hotel are its small size and its location. Why go to Paris and stay at a Marriot when you can stay in a charming Parisian hotel like this one at much cheaper price? The hotel is about 4 blocks from the Eiffel Tower and resides in a nearly silent neighborhood at night. The hotel's off a road, that's off another road, right by cafes, and the La Rue Market area. We felt like residents instead of tourists because we stayed in this area. The breakfast each morning was efficient, never overly crowded, and good. Basic bakery bread, croissants, juices, very light and quick for a long day of sight-seeing. The beds were hard, but that's our style. Again, the room was spotless, modern, and quiet. The air conditioning was not very powerful, but sufficed. We were never uncomfortable. The front desk staff responded to every e-mail, question, and arranged for taxis and supplied great advice. The lobby has maps, books for reading, tour offers, along with a nice cozy fireplace. This is not a typical hotel, but rather an inn. Its location is astounding.. we were right by everything. We took the double decker tour bus and used it as a taxi. It was mostly good other than one driver that would stop for no reason for 20-30 minutes. The Louvre has got to be seen to be believed. It was the best trip ever and staying in this small hotel really enhanced our enjoyment... from the friendly staff, to the quiet rooms, we loved the place. Bathroom was SPOTLESS.. everything was so clean, smelled of Mr. Clean even (not annoying, just proof that the room was cleaned meticulously.. Oh yes, having the small safe was great for passport storage.. we also loved leaving the key at the front desk.. it hearkens back to an era where hotels were about service as much as accomodation. The hotel is under new ownership, but hopefully the staff will be kept (Reesa, Emilie, etc).

<Content>Charming Hotel, Wonderful Service, Great Location We just returned from our European adventure and for the last 4 nights were at the Hotel du Cadran. The staff was welcoming, helpful and friendly from the very moment we checked into the hotel. The rooms are good - based on European standards for size - and had great water pressure for showers. The rooms were very clean and had individual air conditioning.The location is great, from my perspective, for a number of reasons.1. Metro stop is just 5 minutes up the street.2. Quiet neighborhood.3. Right off Rue Cler - a wonderful street with a pedestrian market.4. Eiffel Tower is just 10 minutes stroll. 5. Two groceries right across the street.6. Good bistro and restaurant choices.I would definitely recommend this hotel for a relaxed stay in Paris.Another great recommendation from the staff, the restaurant Leo le Lion - right around the corner.

<Content>Friendly hotel in Paris My husband and I stayed at the Hotel du Cadran on three occasions over the last three years. We spent a week in early April 2006 and found the Cadran to be as nice and comfortable as our first stay. It is a small very friendly hotel with excellent staff and location. The staff are very pleasant and go out of their way to be helpful. The location near the Rue Cler, a lively pedestrian only neighborhood of cafes, markets and small shops, is superb. The Cadran is one block from a subway, a 15 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower and a convenient walk from numerous other sites of interest. Wireless internet access (wifi) is available for those who have their own laptop computers and there is an available laptop in the lobby for guests to use. The rooms are clean and neat and the prices are quite reasonable. We are already planning our next stay at the Cadran.

<Content>Great Experience My wife and I just spent 8 nights at the Hotel du Cadran. We found the hotel / room to be clean, safe and in a great location. The included breakfast was always fresh, the coffee excellent and the staff very pleasant - coffee refills, etc. Our experience with the front staff was equally pleasant as they were helpful when we needed information and courteous when we did not. The room was of average size, based on our experiences in other European cities - my only complaint was the size of the tv and a poor remote! The elevator was rather slow, but we were on the 1st floor above the lobby, so the stairs became our option except when moving luggage.I would have to say that the convenience to sites, metro, eating areas, and just positive vibes would encourage us to consider and recommend this hotel again in the future.

<Content>Good Location, But poor accomodation The best thing about this hotel is it's location. It is within 5 mins walk of the metro and easy walking distance to all the tourist sites.The staff were very friendly and did their best to help us. However the non-smoking room we asked for smelt of stale tabacco. The rooms were very small but i think this is the norm in Paris. The mattress had sunk in the middle but this was repaired the following day. The bedding and towels were stained and on our last night / morning there was no hot water, so we couldnt have a shower !!It was ok for the 3 nights we were there but would not stay here again.

<Content>Horrific Customer Service in a Crisis Stayed at Du Cadran for three nights in total which were less than adequate! Our room was miniscule, customer service was inconsistent at best - but the icing on the cake was the morning of departure when our mini safe wouldn't open and eventually a 'handy man' came to our room with an angle grinder to retrieve our belongings. During the forty minutes of waiting for our passports and personal items to be rescued I had several extremely unsastisfactory encounters with frontdesk staff who blamed me for my inconvenience! Our belongings were significantly damaged by the workman's attempts to cut the minisafe open which the front desk staff refused to recognise and maintain was not their fault.The morning turned into a horrific fiasco during which not one of the hotel staff took responsibility for what transpired, when we asked to talk to someone in charge we were directed to contact the hotel manager who was conveniently unavailable and who the staff would not contact on our behalf. The whole situation denigrated into a very hostile situation which resulted in our nearly missing our plane.I will never return to this hotel and this experience has marred what should have been an otherwise enjoyable holiday.

<Content>Perfect Stayed at the Hotel Du Cadran for 3 nights after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor. Got a great deal on expedia, and can't think of a bad thing to say about this hotel.10 minute walk and you're at the Eiffel Tower. 25 minute walk and you're at the Champs Elysee. Ecole Militaire Metro stop is a 2 minute walk.Lovely area, very residential, quite and clean.The hotel istelf has great staff, a nice breakfast and we managed to get a room with a (very slight!) view of the Eiffel Tower. Room 505 I think it was.The rooms aren't huge, but this is standard in European cities. Hopefully you won't spend too much time in your room anyway with so many great sights on your doorstep :-)To summarise - I can't fault this hotel, and would recommend it to anyone.Chris

<Content>Good value hotel in one of the worlds great cities. Paris is on most travelers agenda at some time. Most people know what they want to do when they get there, but where to stay? If, like me, you plan to spend most of your time out of your hotel, sampling the delights of the city, then you will probably want a good value hotel, offering clean and comfortable rooms, in a good location. Perhaps additionally, you would like to be in an area well served by restaurants, cafes and bars, with good transport links via the Metro?If so, the Hotel Du Cadran will serve you well.From the moment we called to tag an extra night onto our stay, to the time we reluctantly left to catch the Eurostar to London, the staff of the Hotel Du Cadran were unfailingly polite and pleasant, many of them demonstrating their excellent command of English and making a mockery of my feeble attempts at French.The Hotel is on a quiet street in the 7th arrondisement, though with the bustling Rue Cler around the corner. It is 2 to 3 minutes walk to the Ecole Militaire Metro station and only a minute or so more to see the Eiffel Tower, especially worthwhile at night to see the illuminated tower and it's light show! Perhaps you could do this before wandering into one of the many, many restaurants in this area. One reviewer below left an excellent list of restaurants to visit, of which Chez Pierrot and Le Petit Nicois on Rue Amelie we visited. I can confirm these are very nice places with quality food and wines at high though not ridiculous cost. Also to add to the list would be Le 7eme Sud restaurant, which serves Mediterranean cuisine. When you are on a budget, or just want something a bit more casual, Le Caf茅 Marche, on the corner of Rue Cler and Rue du Champs de Pars, literally 45 seconds from the hotel, is an excellent choice.So, if you are primarily heading to Paris for the city itself and not the luxuries of your hotel, check out the Du Cadran. You will be pleased you did.

<Content>A pleasant stay for a long weekend Hotel du Cadran is a small, affordable and very pleasant hotel situated 5 minutes from the Ecole Militiare Metro stop and is literally a 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. The rooms are clean and tidy with all the basic amenities. Ideal if you are staying for a fairly short period of time. But if you are looking for lots of closet space and fluffy bathrobes, you might want to look elsewhere. The staff are extremely helpful and warm (and they speak good English, if your Francais is a bit rusty). There is a pleasant breakfast room with vaulted ceilings in the basement for your early start of croissants and caf茅. (tip: we were on the fourth floor and the lift is painfully slow. You might find it quicker walking down the stairs!) The hotel is in a great location for local restaurants, shops and transport. I recommend exploring the restaurants of nearby Rue Amelie (e.g. Chez Pierrot for melt-in-the-mouth Boeuf Bourguignon or Petit Nicois for some excellent, piping hot mussels) and nearby supermarkets can help out with some early evening beers and snacks if you are in need of libation after a day鈥檚 hike round Paris and don鈥檛 wish to raid the mini-bar. All in all a very decent hotel.

<Content>Tiny rooms near the Eiffel Tower Affordable hotel near the Eiffel Tower and Rue Cler pedestrian shopping street. I had expected that the rooms would be small but these rooms are very small and charmless. Nowhere to stow luggage or unpack. Rollaway bed for my 13 year old daughter was only 4 feet long. Very difficult to move around the room. That said, the front desk help is friendly and the hotel is well located and quiet.

<Content>are you sure this is P{aris ? This is truly a 'find', within sight of the Eiffel Tower, walking distance to the Quai D'Orsay, Grand Palais and long walk to the Pompidou Centre.A really warm reception on arrival, helpful in the extreme with taxis and information, clean (smallish) rooms, plenty of hot water and TV and coffee machine that all worked. The hotel was so quiet that we overslept every day !Breakfast served in the basement was very good, with tasty coffee and well-baked croissants and crunchy bread All made for a perfect long-weekend break. We really couldn't believe that this was Paris - but it was !!!We shall be back.........

<Content>Outstanding hotel Years ago, right after the hotel opened, I became aware of it because my neighbor in Sydney, Australia was the owner's daughter. Because my husband travelled frequently to France on expense accounts for business meetings, we were always on the look-out for somewhere we would enjoy as we'd have to pay for it ourselves. This hotel did not disappoint. We were given a corner room on the top floor and I have recommended that room, or the one beneath it, to friends for years now. No one who has ever stayed here has come away disappointed. Near the hotel is a restaurant, Rex in its name I believe, which has big crocks of pate which diners pass from table to table. Be sure and see if it's still there. Madame Cadran and her staff are fabulous and understand and cater to American/Canadian/Australian tastes while providing utterly charming French hospitality.

<Content>nice hotel in Paris Having returned from a second year and second week's visit to Paris at the L'Hotel du Cadran, I suggest this small hotel of charming hospitality located near the Eiffel Tower should be a first choice for travellers who enjoy an ambiance of old world character combined with thoughtful, welcoming service.

<Content>Great hotel near the Eiffel Tower My family (myself, husband and children 15, 13, and 11) spent 5 nights at the Hotel du Cadran in July 2005. The hotel in a great location close to the Eiffel Tower and the Ecole Militaire Metro station. The neighborhood was quaint with nice shops, cafes and even a coin operated laundromat. The rooms were small, as are most throughout Europe, but very clean and the bathrooms were very modern and clean. The shower had plenty of hot water and great water pressure. From the moment we emailed the hotel to make reservations we experienced their welcoming and professional demeanor. They gladly made arrangements for our transportion from the airport. All the staff at the the hotel were extremely friendly and helpful in helping us with directions etc.. The breakfast was in a cozy room with beautiful stone ceilings. The food was fresh and I cannot stop thinking of the those croissants even months later! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonably priced hotel which will give a true experience of life in Paris. We would definitely return.

<Content>A great hotel! The Hotel Du Cadran is a wonderful place to stay. I took my wife to Paris for her birthday. We'd never been and have long wanted to visit. We travel quite a bit and expected a small room so were not surprised by its size. It was small and homey. We did however find the bathroom to be one of the cleanest in any hotel we have ever stayed in. And that is a priority for my wife. We chose to upgrade our room to a deluxe for the king size bed (actually 2 singles pushed together but was no problem), which gave us a few more square feet. It鈥檚 a nice quiet place with great cafes and fruit and bread shops right around the corner. Definitely stop in and buy your water before heading out as it will save you quite a bit of money. The hotel staff was delightful and made us feel immediately at home. They answered our many questions about the language (how to say certain phrases or ask for things), places to visit, and travel around the city, which we found very helpful. The continental breakfast was great and a good way to start off the day. As others have written the Metro day pass is the way to go. Everything, and I mean everything, in Paris is just steps away from a Metro stop. Maximize your time by using a Metro map when planning your sightseeing destinations.Hotel Du Cadran we will definitely stay with you again! P.S. For you Americans that think the French hate us, they most definitely do not. They may find some of us loud, pushy, and obnoxious because we think that we are better than everyone. As you travel to foreign destinations respect the differences in culture and learn from them. Americans don't do everything better and other countries shouldn't do it the way that we do. A few phrases in the local language go a long way to making your travels much more enjoyable!

<Content>A nice wee hotel If you read the reviews you'll expect that the rooms will be small and ours was. Apart from that though the room was great in a functional sense. The ensuite shower room was very clean and general housekeeping standard was high. Location was also excellent with good local brasseries, a little street market around the corner, and a little supermarket across the road. Oh, and the Metro 3 minutes walk away. We have no qualms in recommending this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel in Paris Stayed in Hotel Du Cadran 10 Rue Du Champs De Mars in Paris. I would like to comment on what a lovely hotel it was. The service was excellent, answered all our questions and gave a great recomendation for dinner. The room was clean. The location was great, 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. I would definitely stay at the Hotel Du Cadran on our next trip to Paris

<Content>Wouldn't want to stay anywhere else I picked Hotel du Candran because of all the excellent reviews that were posted on Tripadvisor. After staying at this hotel for 3 days with my mother in the middle of October, I could not agree more. This hotel had absolutely everything you are looking for in a hotel in Paris. It was no close to the Metro which I highly suggest. It will save you so much money so you don't have to take a cab or walk to your feet give out. Just buy a 3-7 day pass and you can use it for all the busses, RER and most especially the Metro. Just make sure if you do use the Metro that you look for the final destination on the line you are going to take. THat is because the name of the fnal destination is the sign you will be looking for in the Metro so you know what Metro to take. Ask for a map when you buy your 3-7 day pass. It sounds confusing but once you do it once it's cake. Did I mention cheap. If two women from Arizona can do it so can you. The metro stop near the hotel is Ecole Militaire (Purple line #8). You can check out the Metro website at ---- to get familiar with it. If you have any questions about it as well you can email me. Click on the Great Britian flag (near the upper right hand corner to display in English) The night desk person was so very nice ( I never did get his name) as where the ladies for the breakfest. My mother and I missed breakfeast one morning and one of the ladies gave us some croissants and coffee. The hotel staff were very helpful with directions and most accomodating. The room was a little small but that is what you get for a European room. However, the room was very clean. I would most definately stay here again without a doubt and I highly recommend the Hotel du Candran.

<Content>Loved Hotel du Cadran My 18 year old daughter and I stayed at the Hotel du Cadran the first week in October for our first trip to Paris. The rooms were small but we expected that. It is a very clean hotel in a quiet neighborhood. It was perfect for us. There are lots of good places to eat close by. The Ecole Militaire metro stop is less than a 5 minute stroll from the hotel. The staff was very friendly  spoke perfect English. We loved this hotel  would stay there again.

<Content>Absolutely WONDERFUL The size of the room is typically European, but the staff were courteous and extremely helpful. The hotel is located off the busy main streets and is located near many wonderful restaurants and cafes. It is a short walk to the Eiffel Tower and the Subway, which provides easy access to all the sites around Paris. Would recommend to everyone.

<Content>Very Friendly  We stayed at this hotel last week based upon the reasonable price and the excellent reviews on Tripadvisor. We weren't disappointed. The staff were always very friendly and helpful, we were even allowed into our room a few hours prior to check-in time even though we had just called in early to drop our bags off.The area is absolutely delightful with a range of bars and cafes right on the doorstep. There is a lively street market just around the corner as well. The vicinity of the hotel is safe and unthreatening - even late evening.The nearest metro station is a five minute walk and the Eiffel tower about 15 minutes away by foot.The only downside is the tiny room that we had (with a wardrobe a similar size to an upturned coffin)! But this doesn't matter - Paris is such a great city who wants to stay in the hotel?

<Content>Brill hotel in a Brill location! The Hotel du Cadran lived up to all it's great reviews on Trip Advisor. It's the perfect place to stay for a citybreak to Paris. This hotel has it all ~ a short walk from the Eiffel Tower, the Metro, shops, bars, restaurants ~ the hotel is very clean and is airconditioned (very much appreciated when we were there!) ~ the staff are friendly and helpful ~ the breakfast although continental is more than adequate.Paris itself far exceeded our expectations. It is a beautiful city, very green, and the people are very friendly.The Metro is very easy to use and also very clean!Thank you to all past Trip Advisors members for their reviews on this hotel.

<Content>Great little hotel My boyfriend and I stayed in the Hotel du Cadran for our second anniversary. I did lots of research trying to find a hotel in Paris that would be both nice and not to crazily expensive, and picked the Cadran from its reviews on Tripadvisor.The hotel was in a great location, just a 10-min walk from the Eiffel Tower and near a metro stop. We were able to stroll up to the Eiffel Tower a few times to see it by day and by night. Also, the immediate area had lots of nice cafes, as well as a supermarket and a nice bakery.The staff were very friendly and helpful. They all spoke excellent English and were great at recommending and booking a restaurant for us, and sorting out taxis and bus times that we needed. The reception area in the hotel was also a bonus. We were waiting there for a while after we checked out, before it was time to go to the airport. There are nice squashy couches and a variety of books to read (which you can also borrow for the duration of your stay). There is a room where the hotel will store your luggage for you after you check out.Our room was comfortable and the bathroom was sparklingly clean. Breakfast was fine - cereal, bread, croissants, juice and coffee. At least it was complimentary, which is not the case in all Paris hotels.Overall, I would say if you are looking for a nice hotel for less than 鈧?00 a night, the Hotel du Cadran is a good choice.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel  Not only is Hotel du Cadran very centrally located within minutes of the Eiffel Tower, Hotel des Invalides, Musee de Rodin, rue Cler, but also some of the best restaurants in town...even next door.The management/staff is extremely generous, thoughtful, helpful, friendly, multilingual. The lobby environment is that of a very comfortable and friendly environment... and definitely worth the money.The rooms are very clean, typical size for a Paris hotel, but definitely worthwhile.Mattresses could use an upgrade, and the breakfast is fine and included. Overall you will not be disappointed when you stay here. Great hotel

<Content>Wonderful location Really enjoyed our 4 night stay at the Hotel du Cadran. The reception staff were very friendly and it was nice to stay in a cosy, clean and pretty room. This hotel is in a perfect location - so close to the metro and the Eiffel Tower, but it's also peaceful. Can highly recommend the busy cafes nearby, head for where the locals seem to be for the best value and tastiest food. There is also a good bakery and pattiserie down the road. We would have liked fresh milk at breakfast though!

<Content>Wonderful place to stay My girlfriend and I have just returned from a short break to Paris; we stayed for three nights at Hotel Du Cadran and we can't recommend the hotel highly enough. Situated in an ideal spot, the Eiffel Tower is a 5 minute stroll away and the nearest Metro station, L'ecoile Militaire, is also within a short walk and has easy access to all the popular Parisian landmarks.There's a supermarket directly opposite and a few nice caf茅's and restaurants nearby too. Despite this, the noise level doesn't keep you awake at night or wake you early in the morning.Our room wasn't as tiny as some of the above reviews would have you believe; it contains an enormous double bed and even with our large suitcases dumped on the floor we didn't have to squeeze past one another on the way to the (very clean) bathroom. Breakfast is a standard continental affair, croissants, cereal, bread etc and taken in a cozy cavern in the hotel's basement.The staff were very welcoming, fluent in English and always helpful with directions, advice etc. We had a few questions before arriving and they were happy to answer these on the phone.Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>What a gem! We just got back from our stay at the du Cadran. My wife, two children and I had a marvelous time here. The location can't be beat! Who wouldn't like to take a ten minute walk down the beautiful tree-lined streets of Paris and be at the Eiffel Tower. The Ecole Militaire Metro Station is around the corner and there are also conveniences such as a pharmacy and laundromat within a block. Not to mention all the shops and cafes. The staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. The rooms were smallish, but clean, modern and more than adequate. The neighborhood is family friendly....quiet and quaint. We absolutely loved it, and, if we ever get over the trauma of flying out of Charles De Gaulle airport and decide to return to Paris, we would definitely stay at the du Cadran.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location Great place to stay, perfect location. Eiffel Tower only a 10 minute walk through the beutiful streets in Paris. Metro station only 3 minute walk, so you can go almost anywhere, and still be close to your hotel by metro. The area is extremely safe, and clean. Yes, there was a bit of construction, but nothing bothersome (they were finished by the time we left). The room was small, but to be expected... but who stays in the room anyway? You have all of Paris to explore (bring good walking shoes!). Also recommed the l'open tour bus, takes you all around major tourist sites in Paris, get on and off as you like. They make stops frequently.Breafast was good, croissants, cereal, ham, cheese, coffee, juice.Great Hotel, would definetly stay here again.

<Content>Perfectly Paris! My wife and I were pleasantly surprised with Du Cadran. It's location could not be beat at all. A short 10 minute walk and you were in front of the Eiffel Tower! Rue Cler, with all of its fantastic markets, was 20 paces away. We created a spectacular makeshift lunch of cheese, raspberries, strawberries, and fresh bread before heading out to Versailles one day. If you needed any essentials, there was a small supermarket across the streey and a pharmacy a block away. The neighborhood offered some excellent restaurants, especially Le Bosquet! L'Ecole Militaire metro station is just down the street, making all of Paris easily accissible. Yes, the room was a little petit, but most in Paris are, and we were actually pleased with the space. It was very clean and the bathtub was very large and comfortable. The staff were very friendly, but we did have a little problem with our wake-up calls two of the mornings that we were there. Overall, it was an excellent stay and we would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Made a great trip even better.... It being my first trip to Europe, I was pretty nervous about the accomodations, especially since all of the big name hotels were ridiculously expensive. We booked a room for a week at du Cadran because of the great reviews here, and they were all correct.The rooms are small...but get over it, you'll be sleeping there and that's it! The bathrooms are very nice, showers work well, clean and recently re-done.The Hotel is right off of Rue Cler, a market street that is filled with great bakeries and restaurants, and a great wine shop with two very friendly english-speaking gentlemen who go out of their way to help you pick out some great wines to take home!The breakfast in the morning is fine, but I would suggest going to Rue Cler and getting it at any of the little cafes, it is better and less expensive.The hotel is also a short walking distance from the Eiffel tower, Les Invalides, and a Metro stop. It is in a safe and quiet neighborhood, but a little removed from everything else. If you're up for drinking and partying, head to the Latin Quarter, this is not the neighborhood! The nearby metro stop is perfect though, as you'll get anywhere in the city in no time at all - with a little practice, of course! You can count on the friendly staff who are more than willing to get you anywhere you want to go. Do not hesitate to ask for recommendations on restaurants, activities, tours, etc., they are very helpful and will get you right there.Also, contact the hotel after booking the rooms and they'll arrange airport transportation. It's reasonably priced and it's nice not have to worry about it when you get off the long flight.Overall, a great place to stay that left a very good impression on my first trip to Paris.

<Content>Perfectly Paris Beautifully clean. Excellent location. Friendly, happy and helpful staff. We stayed 3 nights and enjoyed every second. A few steps away from the Rue Cler with its antiques market, cheese and wine shops, cafes and pattiseries. Easy walking distance from Ecole Militaire Metro and a five minute stroll to the Eiffel Tower. We had a standard room which was pefectly adequate but when we return we will definitely upgrade to a superior room. Would not hesitate to recommend the Cadran to anybody.

<Content>Lovely Hotel Have just returned from a weekend spent staying at this hotel and I cannot praise it enough. The staff are warm and friendly, the hotel is clean and the location is excellent. The hotel is very near the Ecole Militaire Metro stop and within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower. The area is quiet and safe at night and the nearby Rue Cler market is delightful. The room was small as has been highlighted before but it was comfortable and clean - and you spend little time in it anyway with such a great city to explore. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay again if (when!) I return to Paris.

<Content>Location Location Location Having stayed in many European hotels I can say the room we had was the smallest I have ever seen. My husband took the chairs from the room and put them in the hall. The bed was not comfortable nor were the pillows. On the plus side the free breakfast offered in the morning gave us a nice start. It was served by a very nice gentleman. The mini bar in the room was handy to keep our cheese, soda and yogurt chilled. The bathroom was quite nice. We overlooked the street (only one floor up) so it was noisy at times. For as much time as we spent in the room the size did not really matter. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful....they had all the answers for our many questions. The computer in the lobby was available for a few euros. The location was the BEST. We walked over to the Eiffel Tower many evenings after dinner and strolled around the Seine. I found all of Paris to be safe and clean...which is more than I can say for American big cities. The people (on the streets) were very friendly to us...we had taken French lessons prior to our trip so we could say a few phrases..It was well worth it. For Paris I think the price was very reasonable and would not hesitate to book this hotel again. Paris is my favorite city in the world so I know I will be back.

<Content>i simply loved this hotel :) I stayed there last week and i have to admit this hotel is great!They are currently refurbishing all the the rooms and the corridors.The room i had was spotless and so quiet .It was what i expected to have in Paris The front office day staff is fluent in English, really eager to help no matter what you ask for (restaurant bookings; taxis; wake up call; tour of Paris and so on).The area is very safe even at night and centrally located(you can walk to The Eiffel Tower, the Invalides Museum , the Rodin Museum, even the Champs Elys茅es.The markert street Rue Cler is amazing, you can pick up what you need a quick bite .I will definitely return.:)

<Content>Simply Delightful What a delightful little hotel. The entire staff was so very friendly. Excellent location. Really liked the mix of residential, restaurants, shopping and the metro stop was just a few blocks. Very quiet neighborhood. The rooms are small but most European hotels have smaller rooms than Americans are used to. Felt very safe in this neighborhood. Would stay at this hotel again and have already recommended it to others.

<Content>Way Way Over-Rated Just returned from an 8-night stay at this property. I'm not sure what most people who have posted comments are looking for, but our experiences were quite different. In summary:Pluses: Hotel is situated in a neighborhood area adjacent to the Eiffel Tower, and very close to the L'ecole Militaire metro stop. Bathroom was pretty decent. In-room safe. Quaint cobblestone street right next to the property which contains a variety of market items including flowers, fruits  vegetables etc.Negatives: Bed was very hard, pillow were paper thin, walls in the hotel have virtually no soundproofing (people just opening a door sounded very loud), furniture is very old and tattered, electrical outets did not work with adapter, breakfast was mediocre, staff was not rude but also not overly friendly, one community iron which was filled with gunk on soleplate. Area is too far away from the better dinner/night spots.Net-Net: This is 2-star star hotel max. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. If you want a nice place to stay, but not something outrageous -look elsewhere. I have a bunch of recommendations for other places to stay. My wife and I (late 30's) loved Paris and are planning a return trip, but definitely NOT at this place. We have a couple other spots in the Latin Quarter/St. Germain already picked out.

<Content>Hotel du Cadran is a gem! This little hotel has a wonderful staff, a fantastic location, and modern amenities. The rooms are absurdly tiny - but they come with a refrigerator, a desk, two chairs and room to turn around - if no one else is in the room at the same time.Bathroom was spacious and the entire place was squeeky clean and well maintained. Desk staff all speak excellent English and are very helpful and welcoming. There is probably no better location in all of Paris if you are looking for a great neighborhood with super affordable restaurants and wonderful shops.

<Content>Loved L'hotel du Cadran The location alone would be enough to give this place a five star review. It is in a charming little neighborhood complete with a very smelly (but splendid!) cheese shop and, of course, a cafe. We also frequented a fabulous pastry shop nearby and found our room accomodations extremely pleasant.  I have traveled through Greece and England and I found this room to be above the standards of Greek accomodations and on par with those of England. The room was comfortable and very clean-- with a bathroom that was superior by European standards. The only reason I knocked one star off this review is that the desk staff was a bit cold (only at the desk though, perhaps because we were Americans?-- the staff at breakfast were very, very polite).  It's a wonderful little hotel in an ideal location and I would certainly stay there again. In fact, I have to say Paris itself was spectacular and well beyond what I expected. We stayed here in June of 2004.

<Content>Fantastic Location! This is a charming hotel that is wonderfully located! The Eiffel Tower is only a few blocks away, as is Hotel des Invalides. There is a Metro stop just around the corner, and a bus line just down the street. Around the corner is the very Parisian Rue Cler - be sure to pick up fresh fruit and bagettes for your lunch! The hotel room is very small, but you don't have much time to spend in the hotel when there is such a marvelous city to explore. The amenities are very modern. It is tricky to work around suitcases, but certainly is no hardship. The breakfast is ample, although a bit monotonous. We discovered that we could purchase a croissant and coffee around the corner for much more money! If you really need a serving of eggs and bacon, there is a restaurant on Rue Cler. The hotel staff could not have been friendlier. Everyone speaks English and is most accommodating. We had a wonderful stay (Jan. 12 - 18), and I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Basic hotel, but a good base for a stay in Paris Stayed in Du Cadran for 4 nights 18-21 Jan in one of their 'superior' rooms. I did not feel a sense of 'charm' about this hotel and would compare it more to a upmarket hostel. The rooms are small and not at all what i would consider 'superior.' In saying that though, the hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff are more than helpful. I would avoid including breakfast when staying here. 1 croissant and a cup of coffee is not exactly the breakfast i had hoped for at 10euros each morning. The hotel is a good base located 2 minutes walk from the nearest metro.

<Content>Great Stay We stayed at this hotel in Paris from Nov 28 - Dec. 4. The only thing that dampened our stay was the weather and drizzling rain (it felt cold, even by Toronto standards). The hotel was charming - we chose this hotel because we wanted to get away from the North-American hotel feeling and the price was very reasonable and the location EXCELLENT.I was surprised with some of the other posts - we did not have any flimsy towels or fraying bedsheets. If you are not looking for luxury but a clean, safe and friendly place to stay - this is a great hotel. Also check out the market on Rue Cler and, specifically, Ulysse - a great little creperie that also serves amazing Greek food.

<Content>Love this hotel and its recently been refurbished We love this hotel. We just retruned from a 4 day stay over New Years. As always, the staff helped us with dinner reservations and sent us to great places to eat.In my opinion, the rooms are above average for this neighborhood and Paris in general. They do have some larger rooms with 2 twins set up as a King sized bed. We always ask for one of those. We noticed that the rooms had recently been repainted and they put new bedspreads on during our stay. Rooms have a minibar and bathrooms are big.The staff at du Cadran is wonderful. We always rely on them to help us with restaurants and they have sent us to some really good ones.If you are looking for an American style hotel go someplace else and pay alot more. But if you want a nice clean, pleasant place to stay in a lovely neighborhood this is your place. We have sent at least 5 other couples here and they were all very satisfied.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay.... Stayed at the Hotel in Dec 04. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean but very tiny (bathroom was nice). We liked the location of the hotel. The breakfast was simple but good. Not a bad hotel for a couple but would not recommend it for a family due to the extremely small room size. Overall....not bad. We enjoyed our stay.

<Content>We had a great stay! Just returned from 2 nights in this hotel. Was a bit apprehensive after reading some of the reviews. We stayed in room 202. The room was very small but everything was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was a bit disappointing as the choice was very limited but we didn't go hungry and the staff were very polite and friendly. Don't bother looking for the Papa Bistro as it has closed down but I can recommend the Cafe de Felice - just 2 minutes from the hotel. The waiter speaks perfect English and was incredibly nice  helpful. Everything everyone has already said about the location we found to be true.

<Content>The Paris you imagine. This quaint hotel is close to the Eiffel Tower. Rooms are small but cute and clean. It provides what I expected as a first time visitor to Paris. The staff was nice and helpful. Smoking is a problem but no more than in most European hotels. I would visit this hotel again.

<Content>Great location, but... The location of this hotel certainly can't be beat, and the staff was very pleasant. However, we found the room we were in (Room 407) to be small even by Parisian standards, and the furnishings were tired and worn. The bed had the thinnest mattress that we have ever slept upon, and the pillows were almost nonexistent. For the price we paid, you can do much better. This hotel needs a serious room make-over.

<Content>Disappointing Hotel We just returned from 10 days in France, and spent two nights at this hotel. We were in Paris for four days (stayed at the Observatoire-Luxembourg), took the train to Lyon, and returned to Paris for two days before flying home. These last two nights were spent at the Hotel du Cadran based on Trip Advisor reviews. We opted to stay at two different hotels on this split trip to Paris to experience different neighborhoods and to compare. The Hotel: we were VERY disappointed with the condition of this hotel, especially after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. While the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, the hotel itself is run down and tired. We were traveling with another couple, so we had the advantage of comparing two rooms (207 and 407). Both rooms were depressing, had stained carpeting and chairs with ripped/frayed upholstery. The closet was so small that it was basically unusable. The beds were miserably uncomfortable--the mattresses were so hard that it was like sleeping on the floor. The bathroom was clean, but the towels were shabby and worn thin, and the shower curtain was dingy. There was nothing charming about this hotel except the lobby and the staff. The Location: we found the neighborhood to be delightful. The location is near Rue de Cler with numerous markets--several small bistros and pastry shops, cheese shops, and wine shops. A metro station is close-by, and the Eiffel Tower is within walking distance.We would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in Paris.

<Content>Excellent hotel in great location Having been to Paris on several occasions this hotel was by far the best. The location is perfect, a short walk gets you to the Eiffel Tower or the nearest Metro station. The hotel itself is clean and the staff friendly and helpful. While the rooms are small, who wants to spend time inside when you can be out and about in Paris. For the price this was a great deal and I would have no hesitation in returning in the future.

<Content>Le weekend Just returned from a wonderful weekend in Paris. Booked Du Cadran after reading reviews on Trip Advisor @ 鈧?3 pps including breakfast. The hotel is in a great quiet location and the room and bathroom were spotless, the bed was also comfortable. However I felt like Alice in Wonderland/Gulliver from Gulliver's Travels in the room as it was sooo small. Didn't unpack my case as the wardrobe was so teensy weensy. The breakfast room was lovely however it was a bit of a balancing act with the crockery in the morning as the tables were tiny. Enjoyed our stay at Du Cadran because of its location, location. It was lovely to look out the window in the morning onto the streets below and watch all the French stroll by with their baguettes under their arms. Would recommend this hotel as not a lot of time is spent in your room and its only 10 mins walk to the la Tour Eiffel.

<Content>good budget hotel I enjoyed this hotel! We got it at a very reasonable price and were a little concerned if it would be good. The staff was very nice, The hotel was cozy. The room small, as are all the Parisian hotels. Clean for the most part. It could have used a new bedspread though. The staff was more than accomodating to help fix any complaints. The bathroom was very nice. We had a view of the beautiful street with shops, bakeries and restaurants. 10-min walk to Eiffel Tower. 4-min walk to the Etoile Metro stop, which brings you to the Madelaine and other good places of interest. I would stay here again! Location was better than the room itself. But it seems I would have wasted a lot of money to upgrade to a hotel that I hardly was in! For a good way to save money, and be able to spend it on better things stay here.

<Content>Fantastic location! We had a great time at the Hotel du Cadran. The reviews were accurate - the hotel staff was friendly, the room was very clean, and the Tour Eiffel is a short walk away. My favorite things about the hotel:- The area - Every morning, we picked up some delicious croque monseurs from one of the several patisseries nearby and feasted in the park under the tower. - The bathroom - I was especially impressed by the bathroom. It was small but the white marble helped trick the eye and made it feel larger. - The mini-bar fridge - It allowed us to take advantage of the spectacular variety of food shops along the Rue Cler because we could take food back to our room foie gras, pates, cheeses, etc.) and feast whenever we wanted. - Window - The room had a beautiful window that opened onto the quiet street below and made us feel so Parisian. The room was small but it was a good size considering it was Paris. I definitely plan to stay there again.

<Content>Will return After many trips to Paris, this is the first hotel that we will for sure return to. Great location, especially if you like the 7th (which we do a lot because it is a real Paris neighborhood), excellent service (guided us to good but not super-expensive local restaurants), and we had a corner room that was clean, comfortable, quiet and very light and airy, so the small size was not a problem (nor a surprise, as we expect small rooms in Paris in less expensive hotels). We found none of the problems that are mentioned in a few of the previous reviews, and all of the many positives others have noted.

<Content>Good Hotel! I stayed here for 2 nights Sat 9  Sun 10 Oct 2004.Our first time in Paris, and we found it to be well located, and comfortable enough considering the amount the room cost (going on Paris rates).Staff were very helpful with any queries we put their way. As previous reviewers have mentioned, there is limited hanging space for clothes, with 5 hangers only being provided.One problem was their lack of hairdryers! They had a limited stock that seemd to always be reserved / out on loan to fellow guests when most needed. Having said that, the staff were aware and were re-stocking, so my comment may no longer be valid.

<Content>First Trip to Paris This hotel was exactly what we had anticipated and it was everthing we had hoped it would be for the 3-days we spent there at the end of September. We knew ahead of time that we were not staying in 5-star first class hotel, we choose this hotel for location and atmosphere. That is exactly what we got and we enjoyed every minute. The room was small and we had lots of luggage since we were spending another 5 days in Monaco. But we had a king-sized bed which was more than we got at the luxury hotel in Monaco (two beds that were just bigger that a twin in the USA). The staff was very friendly and helpful, the hotel was worn but we found it to be clean and well maintained. We thought the breakfast was great, it was predictable but it was exactly how we like to eat in the mornings. There are probably some nicer hotels in the same area, but we were completely satisfied with the experience we had at the Hotel du Cadran Tour Eiffel.

<Content>Paris is great, Du Cadran average Stayed here for 3 nights from 20th September and would agree with other advisor comments regarding helpful staff, cleanliness and location, which was ideal with plenty of cafes and restaurants and very quiet on a night. The downsides were very small room with just enough space to walk around the bed (large and comfortable), small bathroom (stayed in 502 on top floor) with inadequate hanging space and like a previous advisor did not unpack our cases. Breakfast was a little disappointing with only 2 choices of cereal, bread, jam, croissants, which were pretty tasteless and small pre-wrapped packs of cheese. Fruit consisted of an apple a day! Try La Terrasse next to Ecole Militaire Metro (turn right out of hotel, first left and about 200 yards walk) which is great for a coffee and beer and watching the world go by after a hard day seeing the sites. Also Bistro de Papa next to it is ideal for an evening meal with good food and excellent atmosphere which gets better after 7pm. Don't go too early as the staff usually have their meal about 6pm. If it is available try the local dish of potatoes and sausage in garlic - delicious! . Would I visit again? Paris definetley (our first trip), du Cadran unsure.

<Content>Fit the bill perfectly My wife and I selected the Du Cadran because of location and other posts which were very complimentary. All of it is true. We were there 9-10-04 to 9-14-04. While the rooms are small, the staff is great, going out of their way to answer questions and provide services. It is literally down the street from the Rue Cler, the unique cobblestoned street of a variety of small shops. There were apparantly many Rick Steves readers around, as we heard his name mentioned by others, several times.The neighborhood is indeed fabulous and the village-type pace presents an inviting atmosphere.The lobby offers many different newspapers, tea, other drinks, and a nice offering of books.We were able to walk to the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, the D'Orsay, and other venues. A great choice.

<Content>A Little Disappointing ... After reviewing your site for this hotel, I duly booked for my husband, myself and four friends to stay here for a four-night break.Our flight from the UK was 5 hours late so we didn't arrive at the hotel until 12.30am. The staff were very friendly and helpful but the hotel itself had obviously seen better days! Our friends were placed on the first floor whereas my husband and myself were on the fourth floor {why do hotels put people travelling together at opposite ends of the hotel??}.Our room was very small and cramped [as expected from information given here] but the carpet was stained and dirty and the bedspread was made of a nylon material - also with dirty marks and stains. The wardrobe had 5 hangers and enough space to hang a few items of clothes. So we did not unpack our cases for the duration of our stay as we had nowhere to hang them.Breakfast was typically French and adequate but the limited choices offered made each successive day less appealing. We have become accustomed in Spain, Germany and the UK to a large selection of cheeses, meats, yoghurts, fruit, bacon etc. and the lack of this choice made breakfast very predictable and - for me - unappetising!I loved the area. Shops, restaurants and cafes abound. I think though next time, we'd look for a slightly better hotel in the same area.

<Content>Good hotel, great location We stayed here for 5 nights and loved the location. So close to the Eiffel Tower, tons of cafes and restaurants around, the fabulous Rue Cler market just outside, and just a few minutes walk to the Metro station. The room was pretty spacious by European standards with a big bed. The bathroom was very clean. The staff was pretty helpful, though they failed to fix our room phone, which was out the whole time we were there. Also, the breakfast is pretty skimpy -- a bowl of cereal and a measly croissant, but there must be a dozen boulangeries within a block of the hotel, so you can always find a better selection. We would definitely go back.

<Content>Great Hotel - Great Location My wife and our two children (ages 8 and 6) just returned from a wonderful time in Paris. We spent our first four nights in Paris at this Hotel. It was perfect for our family as we had two adjoining rooms which had separate bathrooms. I was concerned reading other posts about the small rooms, but we though they were charming. The bathrooms were very very nice. We had breakfast included which was a great way to start each morning. We read about this area being the ideal location (next to the Rue Claire) in Rick Steves book. He did mention this hotel, but did not give it a good value rating. I would disagree. The staff was very nice and very helpful. If we ever go back to Paris, we would stay here again without hesitation. Now that we know our kids can handle forgeign travel (and we can handle our kids handleing foreign travel) we can't wait to return to Europe. Hopefully the dollar will strengthen as France is expensive!!

<Content>Amazing Hotel What can I say about this Hotel, we visited in early August and it IS the most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in.Everything was very clean and tidy, the staff were fanatastically friendly and helpful we cant thank them enough for what was a truly fantastic holiday.The location is superb only 2-3 mins from the Eiffel Tower and close to all public transports. The next time we visit Paris we will most definitely be booking into Hotel du cadran

<Content>Great Service, but hotel has deteriorated First of all, the employees at this hotel were outstanding, everyone went out of their way to help make our stay pleasant. Very helpful and understanding people. However, the building has deteriorated since I first visited this hotel 4 years ago. The two rooms I stayed in were extremely small, even for Paris' standard. The first one was even smaller and they moved me to a new one, with a bit larger bathroom. The matresses were VERY hard; the towels were old and stained; leaky windows (rain); and dirty shower curtains. 4 hangers in the room and no space to put clothes, that was tough. The A/c worked o.k. (Tip: keep curtains closed). The elavator was small with no ventilation and was always smelly. Of course, no A/C in elevator, which was VERY slow. Location: My wife loved the location; quiet neighborhood close to several good small bistros and many pastry shops, cheese shops and wine shops. A metro station is close-by, but be advised that this metro line goes to only a few places, so you always need to connect with other lines to get to most places. The Bus (69) stops very close to the hotel so this was good and the RER is also close-by the Eifell tower. All in all- we had a wonderful stay in paris, but I think there are better hotels within this price range. The people made the difference!

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel is fantastic. The rooms are neat and clean. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The location is perfect. Except for one night out of 5 we ate at a different cafe within one block of the hotel. There is great food literally next door. Get room 504. It has a view of the top of the tower. The air conditioning is a life saver in August.

<Content>Loved location! Stayed here two nights in July, 2004 and would recommend without hesitation. Biggest asset is location--really a 10 minute walk from Eiffel Tower and right off of Rue Cler Market Street with its bakeries, wine shops, creperies (try the banana and Nutella crepes) and more. Metro station 5 minute walk. The location is very quiet, with a neighborhood feel. The hotel is very Parisian with window boxes outside windows that open onto the street. Rooms are small (with king bed you have just enough room to walk around the bed) but bathrooms are large with nice tub and shower. Everthing is very clean. Breakfast includes breads, jams, cereals (the granola is fantastic), cheese, fruit and juices, and eggs can be ordered for additional cost. For a great Paris Bistro experience try Bistro de Papa restaurant (turn right out of hotel, left at first street, restaurant is on left side of street). Service was superb and food good. Would stay at Hotel du Cadran again.

<Content>A Great Hotel I stayed at the Hotel Du Cadran for for 4 nights in July with my Mum. We arrived late and tired, but were met by friendly, helpful staff.The rooms are standard sized for Paris (compact), well appointed, with modern bathrooms and lovely toilletries. The a/c was fabulous, the shower rather good, and the bath a good size, and plenty of mirrors and lamps. The room we were were originally given did have a leak in the bathroom, but we were given another room straight away, with many apologies for the problem, both that night and the next.Breakfast was standard Paris fare(Croissant, juice, bread, cereal, tea/coffee/chocolat, fruit), tasty and filling, and the staff extremely friendly and helpful.The hotel's location has to be one of the best. On a quiet street not 5 mins from M. Ecole Militaire, it was very peaceful. But only around the corner a wonderful street of shops, restaurants, and parisan life. Also, literally a 10 minute stroll form the Eiffel Tower and the Seine. A 5/10 minute metro ride to Champs Elysee, Louvre and St. Germain, A peacful, yet central location. A wide variety of resaurants are also within a couple of minutes stroll of the hotel.All-in-all, a great hotel I would highly recommend for anyone looking for wonderful stay in Paris. I would certainly stay here again.

<Content>A true gem in the heart of Paris - Formidable! We stayed at le Cadran June 16  17 2004 and loved it. The hospitality of the staff is what sets it apart from other hotels. Emilie was most helpful getting us to Gare Montparnasse on time with all our luggage! THe rooms are small but very clean; the bathrooms are spacious and extremely clean. The breakfast was good continental and the gentleman working there was very friendly. We loved the neighborhood feel of the area. Everything you could need is near by...restaurants, grocery stores, bureau d'echange, post office. My husband could not get over the quiet streets at night. You feel like you're in a village in the middle of Paris. The sites are within walking distance. We visited the Tour Eiffel, les Bateaux Parisiens (at the foot of the Eiffel Tower), les Inavlides, and the Musee Rodin all by foot with two children (79). We would stay at the Cadran again without hesitation!

<Content>Well worth the money My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in June. Its a wonderful place-the staff is most helpful and friendly. The room is average size and very clean and the bathroom was immaculate. We had a large window with flowerboxes overlooking the street. The hotel is not on a main street so our room was very quiet and we slept peacefully. The breakfast was typical of French breakfasts-I would have been happier with a little more selection. I felt very safe at night in the area. Several brasseries within walking distance, post office and bureau de change right around the corner. Metro stop very short walk from hotel. Eiffel Tower 10 minute walk. We highly reccomend this hotel.

<Content>A great hotel in Paris Stayed at the Hotel du Cadran from July 1 - 3, 2004 on the recommendation of Trip Advisor reviews. A wonderful three star hotel in a great location. Rooms are small (typical for Paris) but charming and have all the necessary comforts. Lovely big bathtub and bubble bath to go with it. By far and away, the greatest asset of this hotel is its wonderful smiling staff who are welcoming and accommodating in a city that is not always known for these characteristics. Front desk staff offered maps, gave directions, sent up wine glasses and an iron, arranged taxis, booked reservations, translated words, arranged wake up calls, loaned guidebooks and fulfilled other requests cheerfully and helpfully. It was an unexpected pleasure to be always greeted by name during such a short stay. By way of example of their hospitality, I left my running shoes in the room after checkout but did not notice until the next day when I was far away in Provence. I called the hotel and found that staff had set them aside. They sent the running shoes to me by express post to the rural address where I was staying - no charge. I received them a few days later and carried on with my holiday. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>wonderful My son and I stayed at the Hotel du Cadran for 5 nights and enjoyed it very much. The room had a full bathroom, with a bathtub and a minifridge. The breakfasts were included in our price, because I had booked before a certain date and consisted of croissants, baguettes, a selection of cereals and fruits. The location was perfect, close to the metro, around the corner from Rue Cler and across the street was a mini grocery store, so we could purchase water etc and store in the fridge. The front desk staff were very helpful. A big plus, was the elevator. It is a tad more expensive, but well worth it!!!

<Content>It's all true... Booked this hotel after reading all of the other glowing testimonials, and to my surprise, it's all true! Yes, the rooms are small, but clean, pleasant and comfortable, the hotel is quiet and beautiful, the hosts are gracious, and it is in one of the nicest Parisian neighbourhoods you could hope for, full of cafes, bars and shops, and relatively few tourists. Transport links are good and it feels safe in the surrounding streets. For the money, though, it is truly spectacular given my experience of other European hotels. Stay in this lovely hotel and spend all the money you save on good food, wine and culture. Paris is a wonderful place and there is no doubt in my mind where I will stay when I return.

<Content>Perfect 3 Star This is a great 3 star property. The room was not that small by Paris standards with a nice bathroom. The staff was great and very helpful. The location of this hotel is very near the Rue Cler street market, many good bistros, and of course the other big left bank attractions. A good breakfast, a hotel filled with artwork and incredibly clean and polished. I would stay here again.

<Content>A wonderful birthday holiday! We stayed here for 4 days in May, 2004 for my birthday holiday. The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly. The rooms, while small, are very well maintained and the bathrooms have been updated. We stayed in room 203 which benefited from air conditioning, or an evening breeze if you don't mind the sounds of Paris. The neighboorhood is very tourist friendly, and the neighboring businesses offer a wide variety of specialties. The Cafe du Marche next door for example is a fine local restaurant with sidewalk seating open late into the night. Two subway stations and several bus lines make getting around town very easy. I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat.

<Content>sweet hotel with lots of character First of all, the rooms are EXTREMELY small. I mean, we could barely fit us and our luggage in there! however, that is seriously the only complaint i can think of and i have been to paris several times and this is not unusual to the city. the bathroom is actually quite large and very clean and bright. the furniture and bedding is pretty and cheery and we enjoyed our stay immensely. the staff, emilee especially, was very friendly and helpful and always greeted us with a smile. we arrived early adn teh room was not yet ready; however, they allowed us to store our luggage and we toured the city a bit before returning. we got the breakfast every morning and it was lovely . . . a typical continental breakfast with croissants and cereal and juices and tea. it prepared us well for the day. overall we enjoyed our stay immensely.

<Content>Fantastic Birthday Surprise I took my mother to Paris for the May day bank holiday weekend as a surprise for her 60th birthday. I'm not a frequent traveller and have never done anything like this before, but I was absolutely delighted when, having sailed through Paris with relative ease using French public transport, we arrived at the Hotel Du Cadran early Friday evening. Unfortunately, our travel company had made a mistake in our booking and we ended up in a room with a double bed, however Emil茅e and Mich猫le on reception could not have been more helpful. Although the hotel was fully booked and they were unable to move us to a twin room, they actually managed to make us feel good about it! I read the reviews before we travelled and can only reinforce everything that I read. The rooms are a little on the small side, but the decor is very pleasant adequate for the time you'll realistically spend in them! All the reviews mentioned that the Eiffel Tower was only 5 minutes walk away, this did take some believing. We were delighted when we walked for less than this time to find ourselves confronted with the most beautiful view of the tower. A further five minutes walk had us standing underneath! We found some lovely restaurants near the hotel, and the streets around the hotel definitely need further investigation. One street in particular, if you come out of the hotel and turn immediately left, continuing along the Rue de Champs de Mars, at the next set of crossroads, if you look left and right, this street resembles a street market, when in full flow! There were some very intruiging and interesting looking shops, but unfortunately we went on a bank holiday weekend, and yes, this did mean that everything was shut! I think overall, for what we paid, the Hotel Du Cadran was excellent value for money and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.
