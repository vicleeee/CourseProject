<Content>Excellent location and great value! My family and I really enjoyed our recent stay at the Hotel Europa. We found the hotel staff to be very nice and polite. Our triple-room was a very good size for a European hotel and very clean. The bathroom was marble and nice as well. The location is very good with being close to a metro station, shopping, and numerous restaurants. We didn鈥檛 eat at the hotel鈥檚 restaurant, but we did eat at number of good restaurants and cafes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the immediate area. If you need your American fast food fix (or something for picky young kids), there is a KFC, a Burger King, and a McDonald鈥檚 not far away. There鈥檚 also a Starbucks not far away on Calle del Arenal for your caffeine fix. It鈥檚 relatively close to the Palacio Real and not far from the Prado. The El Rastro flea market is also within walking distance. It is a busy area, but it is the heart of Madrid. We had a room away from the Puerto del Sol, and we didn鈥檛 any problem with noise at all. We were very happy with our stay, and if we make it to Madrid again, we鈥檒l definitely stay at the Hotel Europa again.

<Content>Superb location just returned from a weekend break .The hotel could not be faulted. The location is brilliant, being on one of the main squares with everything a ten minute walk away.So many bars and restaurants to choose from and most of them serving free tapas with your drinks. Sometimes so many we didnt need a meal.The hotel is really clean and well maintained, and the staff really helpful (a bit moody in the breakfast room)All in all a really good choice if you only have a couple of days and want to be able to walk easily to the main attractions.One thing we found. the cable car only runs on weekends at this time of year.

<Content>Love it! Have stayed here 5 times already! I have stayed at this hotel several times since 1997. The location is perfect, with excellent staff, and well appointed rooms. It was recently remodeled; the rooms are spotless with decent size bathrooms. If you don't enjoy Madrid's night life, ask for a room not facing Puerta del Sol or calle Carmen, those streets can be noisy. You will get a lot for your money! Enjoy your vacation to the fullest!

<Content>Great HOTEL GREAT VALUE We had a spacious room on the second floor facing Puerta del Sol. Loved the energy of the City first hand from the balcony. Staff were very friendly and not afraid to engage in light hearted conversation even with our broken Spanish. Clean comfortable bed and it seemed staff were cleaning constantly. Great central location and the restaurant on the terrace served great tapas and some of the hardest working efficient waiters we have ever witnessed. Sure they asked us to spare the towels if possible. that is fine with us especially in a country where a rainy day is a god send.

<Content>Worth the price This was our first European trip, so we were not entirely sure what to expect. First, the good: Extremely efficient and professional staff, from the doorman to the desk personnel to the cleaning staff. All were very responsive to our requests and made our stay as hassle-free as possible. Also, what a delight to open the balcony doors and look out onto the Puerta Del Sol, and to have so many of Madrid's major attractions right at our fingertips. We had read complaints of street noise, since the hotel overlooks the busy plaza. Well, what do you expect? That's like going to a beach and complaining about the sun. We resigned ourselves to the noise (which wasn't all that bad) in exchange for this terrific location. And, they provided free use of a computer in the lobby, with a very understandable 15-minute limit. Now, the bad: The rooms were cheaply furnished, with not so much as a picture on the wall, and very little sitting space. The bathroom was very attractive, but not well stocked. There was a note asking us to re-use our bath towels in the name of the environment. The soap was less than half the size of a credit card. And there was no face cloth provided. Scrub with your hands. Also, it appears there is no such thing as a king bed in Spain. At the Europa and other hotels during our trip, they simply pushed two twin-sized beds together. Finally, the restaurant was okay at best. More like a diner. Bottom line: For what we paid, the Europa was a tremendous value. And we had to remind ourselves that some of the shortcomings may have been due to what we've become accustomed to in our domestic travel. We would definitely stay at the Europa again.

<Content>Loved the Europa We could not believe our luck when we arrived at the Hotel Europa last week . We were met at the door by a friendly porter who promptly relieved us of our bags and deposited them in our room. The staff at the check-in desk were very efficent and friendly and have a multitude of languages . The room was usual European city size and was very comfortable with a large bathroom and had lovely french doors opening onto a little balcony. The hotel has a very popular restaurant and outside terrace , perfect for relaxing in the evening . Our room also had air conditioning which was much needed in 30 degree temperatures. Actually - check out the website - the rooms are very much as is on the pictures. Fantastic value for 鈧?0 per night for the room. The hotel itself has a perfect location. Right outside its door are shops like Mango  Zara and many other hight street stores  department stores. You're also no more than 5 mniutes walk from the main shopping street the Gran Via and less than a 10 minute walk to the main bar / restaurant area. Everything within Madrid is easily reached by walking. The hotel can also arrange the open top bus tour which I would highly recoommend to anyone visiting the city for only a few days. There is also free internet access in the foyer - there is a limit of 15mins per person tho.

<Content>Mediocre hotel I read several good reviews of this hotel, but was a bit disappointed. Mediocre hotel and mediocre value for what you get. Yes, the location is central but almost too hectic. I would prefer a slightly quieter street. Rooms are sparse, nothing special, though clean. Really did not like towels - thin, old, scratchy - and barely provided any soap (picky perhaps, but that is something I notice). Staff is pleasant but nothing to make note of. Making reservation was very easy though. Would not recommend the restaurant. I read a good review so I had lunch there, but I do not recommend it. I probably would not stay here again nor would I recommend it. Instead I would either look for a lesser-priced but better value BB, or I would just spend more for a nicer hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel, good value, noisy outside This is a great hotel as others have commented. It was better than the two different Madrid hotels we stayed in once our tour started -- (Florida Norte and Abba Madrid). The restaurant and outside cafe are charming, the waiters are friendly and someone always speaks English. Free internet. Very clean; I saw the a cleaner on the floor scrubbing with a toothbrush like utensil. Marble and wood everywhere. One factor, which the Hotel has no control over, is that a new Subway station is being built in the Puerto del Sol which some rooms front on. The jackhammers started at 7 a.m. and go until 11:30. p.m. There are two sets of doors to close the windows of the room which definitely deadens the noise but then we couldn't hear the musicians which were also playing in the square.By the way, I believe the Hotel is called Europa Hotel. I didn't see the word Residencia anywhere. They have a good website with lots of information and photos and respond within 24 hours to e-mails.

<Content>Loved Hotel Europa We just returned from a three day visit to Madrid and stayed at Hotel Europa. This is our second stay at Europa and the first since its renovation two years ago. This hotel does not disappoint. Not only is it ideally located right smack in the middle of Puerta del Sol, but it is spotless and the staff is very helpful and friendly. One piece of advice鈥攐n our first trip we had a great room with a balcony overlooking the street; but we had a hard time sleeping because of noise that continued well into the wee hours. For this trip I booked an interior room and had no problems with noise. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning to visit Madrid.

<Content>Ants This was our second time staying at this hotel. The first visit during the winter (February) was perfect (we loved the spaciousness, the location and the price). In contrast, this time (July), we only stayed for one night, because in the morning, we saw little black ants in the bathroom and crawling across the floor. Ants are not the type of souvenir that I want to take home in my luggage. So, we left the hotel, but reported the problem to the desk clerks; sadly, they did not seem surprised.

<Content>Location and price can't be beat! Great hotel at a great price. Clean rooms, friendly staff and great views of the plaza from our balcony. Also the restaurant had some of the best food we had on the trip. Within walking distance to the Prado one direction and the Palace the other. Wish I could have stayed longer, Also 1 block away is the Dept store El Corte Ingles. Don't miss their wine and cheese.

<Content>Far Better than Expected! What a great little hotel! Can't be beat for the price. We loved everything about it. We wanted to stay in a central location and you can't beat the location of this hotel. We were in Paris right before Madrid and were expecting something similar to what we stayed in there (small bathroom, no-a/c, bad service, etc.) but were completely surprised and pleased with Hotel Europa. It far exceeded all of our expectations. All of the staff are friendly, competent, and helpful. The entire hotel is very clean and modern. Although it is right on Puerta Del Sol (lots of pedestrian traffic) it is very secure and safe. We requested a room on the highest floor possible and you should too. The rooms facing the outside of the hotel all have a small half balcony with double doors and double-pane glass. The Puerta Del Sol can be a little noisy with all the shops, restaurants and musicians, but with the doors closed we couldn't hear a thing. The late-afternoon sun would shine right on the balcony and it was nearly magical in a way to stand there and bask in the warm Madrid sun with the narrow streets, pedestrians, and old buildings below. The room had 2 beds and was big for a European hotel. The bathroom was huge and sparkling clean each day. It had both bath and shower (again a rarity) and the floor, walls and vanity were all polished stone. Our room was located on the side street (Calle del Carmen) instead of directly facing the Puerta which we liked better. Many shops and restaurants are in walking distance, the Metro is a couple steps away. Plaza Mayor is a 5 minute walk, as is San Gines Chocolateria. Starbucks is right down the street, and the double decker bus tour stops at Puerta del Sol (worth the money to see Madrid sights- and they sell tickets at the hotel front desk.)Ample closet space, in-room safe, great central heat/air, and overall a quiet environment. Also the Hotel cafe is great for late night snack or coffee  breakfast in the morning.Only one downside is that the internet connection was quite slow, not sure why. Wireless does not reach the upper floors although it is available in the lobby. When we inquired about the slowness of the hard-wired connection in the room, we were told that we should rent a cable from the hotel for $2 per day and the speed would be improved. Sounds like a scam to me, although I never felt that the staff were dishonest or misleading in any way. Maybe I misinterpreted what they were saying Book this hotel now because they undoubtedly will be awarded more stars which means they can raise their rates. Right now it is a bargain for the location and level of service.

<Content>Good choice We (2 adults + 1 teenager) spent comfortable 3 nights in 4th floor room overlooking the Puerta del Sol in early June. We checked in early and room was already ready at 10 a.m., and when I requested a larger one, the front desk immediately concurred. Room was not big, by any means, maybe 300 feet? but plenty of room for a queen bed + twin. Nice view with small balcony, which was mostly quiet, but watch out for the drunks outside at 4 a.m. and the saxaphone player! The hotel was clean, well run, and the staff was friendly and helpful. Free internet in lobby.Great location.Cost of room: 120 Euros.

<Content>Great Value, but Firstly, the hotel, in my experience, uses simply, the name, Hotel Europa, as opposed to Hotel Residencia Europa. This maybe significant as they are not listed with the usual booking sites.I believe it is privately owned and they apparently want to do their thing without involving fees or discounts to anyone.This however is NOT a drawback as their rates are well below the average.Like most reviewers, we found our six nights spent in a clean, modern hotel, well run and friendly. The bathroom in particular was new. Location is in the very center of Madrid, indeed, in the very center of Spain. Restaurants, shops, Metro, sights, museums are all within easy walking distance.The room came with cable TV and free Internet access via a cable (wireless and a laptop are also free in the lobby). Three things detracted from our comfort: We had a larger room facing the Puerta del Sol and noise was a problem from street musicians despite the soundproof (almost) glass windows. The music ends at 11 PM but be prepared to be serenaded until then. A smaller room facing away from the square would be the only remedy. The mattress on the bed was so hard and unsupportive we both had back pains each morning. Nothing chronic, they went away, but be aware. While there was more than enough space in our room, only straight backed desk chairs were provided. No sofa or easy chair were available at the end of a busy day. Aside from these caveats, it was a fine place to stay, the savings were considerable and we would return.http://hoteleuropa.es/index.en.html

<Content>A great budget hotel in an ideal location The enthusiastically glowing reviews of this hotel are well deserved. It is in a great location for playing tourist (the Metro Sol station is right next to the hotel) and it comes at a great price. Everyone I met at the front desk spoke excellent English and had a great attitude.I had a room with a balcony facing the Puerta del Sol plaza, so I was a little concerned about the noise. However, the windows had double-paned glass, and I usually could not hear the crowd noise above the air conditioner. The room had contemporary furnishings, and everything was clean and in good condition. The room had plenty of space.In addition to the internet available on a public computer in the lobby, my room had an ethernet connection. You need to have your own CAT5 cable. Somehow, I was not able to make this work, but I suspect that the problem was with my computer. I was told that wifi is available in the lobby, but I did not try it.I lost my wallet on the Metro between Barajas and the hotel. The staff was understanding and helpful. They provided the toll-free numbers for VISA and MasterCard, and they let me stay even though I did not get a replacement credit card until the last day.So what did I not like? The room did not have a refrigerator or a minibar. The first few days, I noticed a slightly soapy smell from the sheets and also in the hallways. I don't know if they started rinsing better, or if my nose got desensitized, but I did not notice the smell after a couple days.The one thing I really did not like was the tiny shower. The inside was only about two feet square (60cm x 60cm), and there was no soap dish or any place to put the soap, shampoo, etc. The plumbing was mounted on the center of the wall, and protruded about 6 inches (15cm) into the shower, encroaching into the precious space. I found it impossible to move around without accidentally hitting the valve and either shutting off the water or changing its temperature; it would have been much better if they had installed the plumbing and controls in the corner, or made the space in the shower a little larger.

<Content>Good location, good price, good hotel Spent 4 March days in cool but sunny Madrid. Situated bang in the centre so people watching from the small balcony is excellent. Room was basic but recently done out, very clean and a good sized modern bathroom with shower over bath. No problem catching airport bus for Euro 1 pp to Avenida Americas and then a taxi/bus etc to hotel. Easy for taxi early morning to airport direct arranged by hotel for around Euro 30. Restaurant/bar attached on ground floor great for simple or big breakfast and a nibble/drink before setting off or coming back in the evening - prices reasonable. All the staff very polite with greater or lesser degrees of English and a smile always greeted a smile. Free internet in lobby for 15 minutes but if no one around for longer. Small charge for room safe. Would definitely stay again if you want ease of location for sites and shopping and at a good no nonsense price.

<Content>great experience! We loved our stay at Hotel Europa. It was in a great location, only a 10-15 minute walk to most major sites in Madrid. The room had a safe (a few euros per day) and the lobby had free use of a computer with internet access. The cafe was also nice for a quick breakfast or coffee! Would definitly stay there again!

<Content>Great Hotel - kinda iffy on Madrid My sisters and I have just returned from our European Vacation and this was our last stop. We were sooooooo happy to see a Bathtub!!! We took showers at all of our Italy hotels and so a bath was a wonderful surprise!The hotel itself is in a great location. Right by the metro stop. In a very busy area and walking to restaurants were not a problem. Staff were friendly and accomodating. They have a little cafeteria/restaurant on the ground floor. Great balcony that overlooked the Puerta del Sol. This really was a lovely hotel and a great end to our vacation.Now for Madrid...ugh. There were soooooo many people there. Tourists, locals, pickpocketers. Yes - we ran into a group of pickpocketers on the subway from the Airport to our hotel. It was a bit of a nasty situation - but came out of it fine. You need to be ALERT when you are on vacation and read all of the cautions to any big city! We did all of that and that's why we came out fine with a story to tell!There is a lot to see in Madrid - and this is a great hotel that is really centrally located to all sites.

<Content>central location, well-run hotel We booked 2 rooms for 6 nights and loved Madrid! The hotel has a great location on the always lively Puerta del Sol. The rooms were very clean and basic. Both rooms included a small balcony with a view of the plaza, absolutely worth the slight added expense. The base price of the rooms was relatively inexpensive, but anything additional is added onto the bill, including use of the room safe and room-to-room calls. Even so, the price is right. Great shopping across the street at the Cortes Ingles (grocery store in the basement, travel agency on the 1st floor for train tickets). Interesting small bars for tapas across the plaza on C. Victoria, many with beautiful tiles. To venture further afield for tapas and drinks, we spent a night out with James, an Englishman who runs walking tours under the name Adventurous Appetites. We tried food and drinks I would not have ordered on my own!

<Content>Okay, but one BIG problem We spent two nights in a double room at the Hotel Europa. The location is fantastic, and the room itself in terms of size and decor was fine. HOWEVER... for the entire duration of our stay, we were forced to endure a pungent smell coming from the drains in our ensuite bathroom. On our second night, the stench resulted in one of the worst nights sleep we have ever had in a hotel. We raised the issue with management and asked to be moved to another room, but they claimed they were fully booked and this would be impossible. At check-out, given the problem could not be fixed and we could not be moved, we requested that the problem be reflected in our room rate via a discount. We were told this was not possible as the manager was not available but that we could follow up via email during the week. Some 2 weeks and multiple emails later, management refused to offer us any kind of discount on the amount we paid for our room, instead offering a discount on our next stay, which is completely pointless as this was a one-off trip to Madrid. We will not be recommending this hotel to anyone nor staying there again ourselves - not because of the problem we endured with the bathroom, but management's attitude and response which was disappointing and unsatisfactory.

<Content>Comfortable well-placed hotel. I am not used to hotel stays and found the experience a good one.The staff are very professional,polite,and smart.So are the facilities.I found the room to be the most plush we stayed in this holiday (out of 4 hotels) and enjoyed the breakfast,snacks and evening meal from the restaurant.Our waiter was a character.The hotel is well placed,close to the square and the bear statue,where street musicians played,and to shops and more bars.You get what you pay for!

<Content>Location and Price 1. Directly atop the Sol subway station.2. The heart of the tourist district.3. Great bakery around the corner on Plaza del Sol.4. Front desk staff VERY helpful.5. Rooms were more than I expected for the price. Tile bathroom, balcony, quiet through windows.I highly recommend this hotel. If I ever go back to Madrid I will want to stay here because of the above reasons and it is also at a central hub of the subway.Free internet in the lobby and very helpful English speaking (kinda) staff were nice extras.

<Content>Fabulous hotel...great price! I was pleasantly surprised that the reviews I read about this property were indeed correct!! The location is unbeatable. The rate was amazing. The room was beautifully, if simply, furnished. I was traveling alone visiting my daughter and this hotel was just perfect! I speak no Spanish, so that was a bit intimidating. I would highly recommend the Hotel Europa to everyone! It was a fantastic experience all around!

<Content>Way to go, Hotel Europa! We just got back from our 1 week Portugal/Spain trip. We stayed 3 nights at Hotel Europa, , # 404 (a triple room). Despite the unimpressive pictures on the website, I went ahead and booked this hotel. It exceeded my expectation and more. We got off from Callao station rather than Sol, so it was a bit of walk for us to get to the hotel, but it is actually only a few steps away from Sol station, so make sure you get off from Sol. Our room was very clean with wooden floor, beds made daily. Our room had 2 windows that opened to 2 balconies overseeing Calle de Carmen, where the city center is. Street noise was not an issue, however, there were loud door closing from inconsiderate neighbors. Right next to the hotel, there is a Tapas bar, the bartenders are hospitable. They did not treat us like tourist. My brother had the snails and I had a small beer. If you like arroz dishes, you should definitely try Restaurante La Barraca (Calle Reina, 29) or Restaurante de Reina (calle Reina,39), they are both on Calle de la Reina, 1 street over from and parallel to Gran Via. Try paella negro con gamgas, appetizers, sangria...I highly recommend them. Our bills came out to be less than 100 euros for 3 people for both places, it was with either wine or sangria, appetizers, soups, try Castilan Soup at La Barraca. Anyway, hotel Europa is central to everything you'd want to do in Madrid, including sight seeing, food, shopping..., everything is within walking distance in europe already but hotel eurorpa just makes everything that much more convenient and enjoyable. El Cote Inglesia (major department store) is 1 block over, Plaza Mayor only a few blocks away... you get the picture. Oh, we were able to see the bear statue from our balcony. If you need a taxi at an odd hour, have the hotel clerk call one for you.

<Content>Excellent stay Hotel Europa is wonderfully located just off the Plaza del Sol, and has clean, roomy, modern rooms in an atmospheric historic building (birthsite of artist Juan Gris). The superior rooms are fantastic, many with great views and a small balcony overlooking the Plaza. If you're very sensitive to noise, street noise may be an issue, since the Plaza is a vibrant, active area late into the night. But the windows have good seals, so I don't think it's a problem for most. (We had a 6 piece street band playing dixieland jazz right next to our window, but with the windows closed it didn't bother us.)Amenities are pretty standard, nothing special. Wifi is only available in the lobby, but you can connect for free by cable from the rooms. Front desk is helpful and friendly.Very rasonable rates for such a well kept, comfortable hotel with contemporary and attractive furnishings and decor, yet a building and atmosphere with some character and a sense of history. And very nice balance of old and new.

<Content>I'll never go back... The hotel is in a great location within walking distance to many of the tourist attractions. The hotel staff was really helpful as well. The rooms were very clean and adequate. Internet is included.The restaurant is very good, we had churros and chocolate....We had a room facing the street, and that night we couldn't sleep because of the noise; we requested another room and the front desk man gave us one interior..another night we couldn't sleep because of a constant noise during the whole night.So think about it before booking......

It's walking distance to all attractions and shopping which was a plus.The hotel staff was really helpful as well.

<Content>Best of the Best Hotel Europa was the best stay of our two week trip through Spain and Portugal. I would give it 4+ stars. Great location, friendly staff, nice bar/restaurant and outstanding accomodations. We were on the second floor facing the plaza. Open the doors to see all the action. Close the doors for peace and quiet. We looked at a few other places nearby, including Hotel Plaza Mayor, BW Carlos V, and Petit Palace, and I would definately choose Europa. Very classy place.

<Content>nice hotel but...... Stayed here for 5 nites and as noted in several reviews its location is excellant and rooms and hallways are clean. Our first 3 nites were in a good size double room on inner courtyard . However, after a few days to Sevilla upon return we were switched to another double room on the inner courtyard that was much smaller than the other and had large crack in the wall; that was not the problem however. A noise from an adjacent building, akin to a howling animal, (we think from the rooftop HVAC unit) every 3-5 minutes thru the nite and day and echoed loudly within the courtyard rooms. We complained to the front desk who acknowledged the problem but could nothing about it. Whether this was an isolated instance I don't know, but certainly was an issue for us and others who complained. Perhaps a rate reduction or a comp at the restaraunt would have been a nice accomodation to us. Barring this incident, the hotel is a fine stay for the money. We paid 80 euro.

<Content>Excellent We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Europa Hotel, Madrid, and have to say, it was great.The location is fantastic, the hotel is just as discribed, very clean and the rooms quite large for a spanish city hotel and the staff, a little reserved, but very helpful and friendly.All the major sights are within walking distance and the hotel is outside the Sol, metro station , which will take you straight to the airport, once your holiday has finished.Great hotel and city, give it a try

<Content>Wonderful Value in Madrid! I had originally booked the Plaza Mayor for 3 nights, because it was higher on Trip Advisor's list than this place. When we decided to add one more night, however, Plaza Mayor was already booked.That is how we wound up at Hotel Europa. I paid 80 euros for each place (for a double), but that price included tax at the Europa. The Europa also provided free internet access in the lobby. Finally, the Europa had a decent, affordable restaurant right off the lobby. That was safe and convenient for people who had just arrived in town and were tired. Also, the rooms were larger than I expected at this rate in a European Capital. Location is on a pedestrian street, which is nice and VERY close to the Plaza de Sol. That is a very central metro stop. The metro is, by the way, very clean/safe and easy to figure out. So, if I come again, I will definitely return here and skip the Plaza Mayor--though both are clean and represent good values. The Europa is just a few notches ahead with regard to decor and space.

<Content>Excellent Value...Beautiful Hotel! Hotel Europa is located on the ever-busy Puerto del Sol; thank goodness for excellent sound-proofed doors as the Plaza never really sleeps.The hotel is a superb value; it's old-world charm and ambience at excellent prices. We paid 鈧?00/night for a great room with a balcony right over the plaza. The beds were hard as is the norm, but were appointed well and the bathroom was gorgeous being all marble; best European bath we've seen in all of our travels.The Metro stop is located immediately in front of the hotel, but if you like a good walk, most major central attractions are within 20 minutes of the property. The staff is multi-lingual and very helpful. Bus tour tickets were available from the front desk, and they were able to arrange a nice and affordable shuttle back to the airport for us at the end of our visit.The Europa Cafe is attached and is a very popular place for good affordable breakfast, lunch, or just sipping a beverage and people watching at one of the many outside tables.One slight caveat; the room door card has to be inserted into a plate on the wall in the room for the lights and Air Conditioning to stay on. That's mostly not an issue, except that the room was always warm upon returning and didn't ever really cool down to a comfortable level for several hours; that made it hard to sleep a couple of nights.Overall though, Hotel Eurpopa is an extraordinarily good value and we'd highly recommend it.

<Content>Our favorite hotel of the trip Stayed at this hotel 4 nights in mid-Sept. In a word - this hotel was perfect! The rooms are immaculate, updated, and very comfortable - an unbelievable value. The location is ideal. We walked everywhere with ease and took the metro when needed, which was right outside of the hotel's front door. Hotel staff was friendly and the computer available for internet access in the lobby was a nice extra.We arrived before noon and were able to check-in to our room immediately. We were given a room with a small terrace overlooking the bustling Puerta del Sol - the exact center of Madrid. Besides being a very popular hangout, Puerta del Sol has some construction going on, so I had some initial concerns that the room might be noisy. Luckily, the room has soundproof windows that blocked about 95% of the noise from outside - I was really amazed and very pleased - and we had no problems whatsoever with noise.This hotel turned out to be our favorite during our 17 day trip to Spain. We wouldn't consider staying anywhere else when we return to Madrid.

<Content>A Terrific Value! We booked a double and triple for three nights and couldn't have been more pleased with the facility, staff, and location. The double-paned windows to the balconey keep the commotion of Puerta del Sol out when you want it, but swing them open every once in awhile and drink in the atmosphere of this lovely city.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Excellent Location My sister, mother and I stayed at the Hotel Europa for 3 nights (ok only 2, but more about that later). It was beautiful, less than a minute walk to two metro stations, right on el Puerta del Sol, the heart of Madrid. The room was clean and large, especially compared to others we have experienced in European hotels.Interesting note: you have to leave your key card in the holder by the door or the electronic systems (lights, AC) will power down after a few minutes.The hotel restaurant is nice, not cheap, but reasonably priced. The food is good, the waiters don't speak a lot of english, but you can get by. It's a great place to people watch, as you are almost on el Puerta del Sol, lots of people are always walking by.The staff is very friendly, they all speak some english, one gentleman in particular speaks perfect english as well as perfect spanish. There is free internet access in the lobby, they ask that you limit your time to 15 minutes per room.The only problem we had with our entire trip was the fiasco of getting to the airport Friday morning. We were all set to take the shuttle to the airport, until we realized it was E20 per person and they only accepted cash, which we did not have enough of as our trip was almost over. Our flight left at 7:15, and the Madrid metro doesn't begin daily service until 6:00. We ended up staying the night in the airport. So my advice to someone about leaving Madrid is to book a flight no earlier than late morning, unless you want to spend the money on a shuttle or taxi, or have someone who can personally drive you to the airport.

<Content>Highly recommend I would go back here and highly recommend it to others. It is in a great location, the rooms are good, good value for the money, friendly front desk staff, a restaurant and bar and free internet (when you can get on it). We stayed at another hotel on our return to Madrid, and were we ever sorry!! I'd have taken the Europa in a flash, but it was booked. Won't make that mistake again.

<Content>Great Hotel! I stayed in this hotel for three nights with my mother and sister, and it was excellent! The staff were very courteous and helpful. Our room was large, allowing three women with a lot of luggage to move about freely. The room was also very clean, comfortable, and quiet. We had no problems whatsoever in staying here. I would definitely stay in this hotel again in future trips to Madrid rather than risk getting an unsatisfactory room in a cheaper hotel.

<Content>Clean and Location Can't Be Beat We stayed over the weekend and we extremely pleased with the condition of the hotel, which looks recently remodeled, the cleanliness, and the location, which is just perfect. And we were very happy with the standard website prices we paid. There were six of us -- 2 adults and 2 kids in a very nice quad, and 2 adults in the superior double. I think the bed in the superior double is king size while the regular sized doubles had a smaller bed. Internet in the room (wired) was free. Lots of convenient shopping to suit all tastes in the immediate area, walking distance to both the Palace as well as the Prado in opposite directions. We would be hard pressed to stay anywhere else on a return visit. No shuttle service from the airport but they called a service for us back to the airport. We had an excellent stay.

<Content>Great for shopping; dislike guest policy We stayed at the Europa hotel for six nights between 22 February through 3 March. The hotel is located right on the popular Puerta Del Sol and just across from Cortes, a large department store with a supermarket at the basement. So getting food/ drinks is not a problem, particularly since there is also a coffee shop next to the hotel.It is worth mentioning that if you're unfamiliar with the area, you might have a little bit of trouble finding the hotel after being dropped off by the cab driver (who's most likely not able to converse in English) for a short walk. Please note that the taxi can NOT stop right in front of the hotel so a little bit of walking is required. I would suggest that you bring a suitcase that have wheels. If you like shopping and crowd watching, this is definitely the hotel for you - it is also a short walk to Grand Via, where there are plenty of shops like Zara as well as some theaters. However, if you require peace and quiet, this is not the hotel for you, as it could get pretty loud particularly on Friday and Saturday nights with the noise continuing till dawn. I was disturbed a little and we stayed on the third floor.We also didn't like the fact that we were charged 2 euros per day for the use of the safe deposit box.But the biggest minus for this hotel is its guest policy, which does not allow for any guest at any time to come up to your room. In fact, we had to leave our room keys at the reception each and every time we leave the hotel.We had a couple of friends who were staying in another hotel at Grand Via come over as they wanted to compare the rooms. After explaining the situation, our friends were allowed up to see our room, but after just a couple minutes, the front desk rang and demanded that our guests leave the room.Overall it was an ok experience, and we would stay there again simplybecause of the convenient location and the reasonable price.

<Content>Recommend Hotel Europa My husband and I booked 2 different stays at Hotel Europa - in between a trip to the Canary Islands. Very efficient booking over the internet and quick confirmation. We took the #200 bus from the Airport and then caught a cab to the hotel, which is located in a pedestrian only zone so, no vehicle traffic noise heard from our room. Large double room and bath. Our second stay we were in another room on the 4th floor and had a sulphury smell coming from the water in the bathroom - we kept the fan on to cut down on the smell. Great location to see Puerta Del Sol by foot. The cafeteria - part of the hotel - is recommended - great cafe con leches! The staff at the hotel kept our skiis and extra gear for us while we were at the Canary Islands. When we checked back in our bags were waiting for us in the room. To get back to the airport we arranged a shuttle pick up in the morning from the hotel for 10 Euro each - very worthwhile!

<Content>Fantastic hotel in great location. The last time we stayed at the hotel Europa was in Dec 05. We found the hotel by accident a couple of years before this when sitting enjoying a cana and tapa's on the Pavement cafe opposite.After research on our return we found the hotel on the web and booked via the hotel website.Have been many times since for weekend breaks and had a fantastic weekend there for my husbands 40th b'day...what can be better than sat outside at midnite on 18th Dec(even though we had coats, scarves etc on) drinking Wine and watching !!.The Hotel is very clean, lovely , spacious rooms overlooking the square,and all the staff are very friendly. The Bar/rRestaurant adjoining serve excellent food all day long, from breakfasts to fantastic evening meals..what a buzz in there.If you goto Madrid visit the Restaurant Botin, the oldest restaurant in the World, its fantastic.

<Content>Location, location, location!!! We stayed at this hotel for 5 days, and we couldn't have been happier about our choice. It's in the heart of Madrid, with a subway entrance right in front of the hotel, a cafe right besides the lobby with excellent prices, and a view to the Puerta del Sol. The hotel was very clean, and the noise was not an issue, although if you are a light sleeper, choose an inside view room. I have a very light sleep, and this wasn't an issue since we came back at night exhausted from the walking, sightseeing and all the fun we had. I can't wait to come back,and I will definitely stay there again!!!

<Content>Central location couldn't be better, yet quiet and comfortable My husband and I stayed here for one night in early October. We didn't have a reservation and called in after catching the Metro from the airport. We would have stayed 2 or 3 nights but the hotel was fully booked. The hotel's central location in the Puerta del Sol right beside the statue of Madid's emblem (the bear and the strawberry tree) couldn't have been better. The room was spacious, cool and comfortable - an oasis from the hustle and bustle of Madrid but right in the centre of things, if you wanted to go out on the town, which we did. Our room overlooked the Puerta del Sol but, with the double-glazed window closed, we weren't aware of excessive noise from the street and slept soundly.The reception staff were friendly, helpful and spoke good English - a pity really, because I wanted to practise my Spanish!Oh! and the price was very reasonable too, especially as we didn't have a reservation.The only downside to staying in this hotel was that renovation works were taking place in the lobby area. Also, the reception/lobby area was small and cramped - but anyway, you don't spend much time there, so it didn't matter. We would definitely stay there again but would pre-book to be sure of a room for the duration of our stay.Portsmouth, England

<Content>Great place to stay Wonderful small hotel in the heart of Madrid. Close to a Metro stop. My room had been updated, especially the bathroom. I had a very small balcony with French Doors that overlooked a very noisey walkway. But you could shut the French Doors and have peace and quite. This is not the Ritz, but if your looking for a small hotel in the heart of things, this is the place to go.

<Content>Good location but request a quiet room The rooms are quite spacious and very clean. The same can be said about the bathrooms. The adjacent cafeteria provides early morning and/or late night dining options for the jet-lagged traveler at a good price. The churros con chocolate hit the spot! The location is very appealing as well for anyone hoping to visit the sites Madrid has to offer. The nearest metro stop is just a short walk away. Upon arrival I was given a single room with a bathroom on the second floor facing the front of the building. At the time of my check-in I noticed some construction taking place in the hotel. Once in my room the noise from the construction immediately led me downstairs to request another room away from the noise which the hotel staff were more than willing to do for me. I was given a room in the rear of the building well out of ear shot of the construction. Keep that in mind if you plan on staying here.

<Content>Very clean  I stayed in 4 other hotels in Spain during my trip and the room was one of the smaller ones but the bathroom was the best at Hotel Europa. I always like to take a nice hot shower in a spacious  comfortable bathroom, which I got at this hotel.It's located in the center-center of the city, very convenient for sightseeing and getting on the Metro. The area around the hotel is always full of people (except for early in the morning) and you can get the feel of Madrid. I knew from (thanks to) other people's review that the hotel was undergoing renovation. I didn't ask for it when I made reservations directly with the hotel but we did get one of the renovated rooms so it was very nice and clean with a tiny balcony. The noise from the outside didn't bother us but sometimes we heard a kind of gurgle noise probably from the other rooms (maybe someone flushing the toilet or using the shower, I'm not sure). I was a bit surprised when I first heard the noise but it was just once in a while and it didn't bother us much. The lobby was going through some construction but we didn't hear anything from our room although our room was just 1 floor above.We didn't have any trouble with the airconditioning, probably because we stayed towards the end of October. Not too cold nor hot, so we didn't have to bother with it. Breakfast was not included but there's a cafe next door. The price ranged from 2.40 (coffee  toast) to 10.00 euros depending on how much you want to eat! Other things I liked and that was helpful about the hotel was that all 3 people I met at the reception spoke English and there's a shuttle service to the airport (I believe several euros cheaper than taking a cab). In some of the websites I saw the hotel is rated 1 star but I found in one of the guidebooks I bought it is rated 3 stars. I don't know how they rate hotels and which is true but if you consider the location, price, cleanliness and comfort of the room and bathroom, I think it's worth staying here.

<Content>Very Clean and In a Great Location We asked for room that was quiet considering that there is construction at the Puerta del Sol. We had a room that faced a courtyards and was very quiet...perfect for light sleepers. There is construction in the lobby of the hotel, but the rooms are spotless and the newly renovated bathroom is a big plus. We were close to everything, shopping, food, and the metro. All the museums can be reached by metro within 10 minutes or less.

<Content>location , location, location! Great hotel, great location, modern room and bathroom, no complaints. My husband, daughter and I stayed at the Hotel Europa for 2 nights the end of September and it was a wonderful experience. Yes, the puerta del Sol is under construction and the hotel lobby is being renovated (construction in the hotel will be done by the end of 2006), but our room was wonderful, we had one double bed and 2 twin beds.The staff was helpful and booked a wonderful tour to Toledo for us. (Dont miss this half day tour of Toledo, it is excellent, leaves at 3pm and returns at 8pm).We walked to the Prado Museum , ate at neighboring Restaurants which were very , very good. Shop at the Corte Ingles department store and buy your water and groceries in their basement supermarket.All in all, a very good hotel in an excellent location. I would definetely stay there again when in Madrid.

<Content>Great Room and Location for Low Price My brother, sister and I have just returned from 2 weeks in Spain. Our last 3 nights were spent at the Hotel Europa. I found it to be a great value. The hotel lobby is under construction but this was not a problem to us at all. We could not hear any noise from our room. We asked for a room with 3 beds and the room had 3 actual beds...not a cot for the 3rd bed. I reserved a room directly with the hotel. The beds and pillows were the best of any of the 5 hotels we stayed in during our trip. It did have an in room safe that cost 2 euros per day extra. The room and bathroom were large. The room termperature was good and able to be controlled by the termastat. The location was fantastic. The hotel is just steps from the Puerta del Sol plaza, the SOL subway station that has direct access to 3 lines, centrally located between the Place and the Prado (15-20 min walk), and steps away from shopping and restaurants. Right outside next to the building the Europa Restaurant has chairs and tables which are great for people watching. Simply the best location one could ask for. If you don't stay at this hotel you should still consider staying near the Plaza del Sol. The hotel staff were very helpful. At all times the desk seemed to have a staff person that understood and spoke english. They were able to answer all questions we had that were unable to get answered previously during our stay in Spain because of language barriers. I've read the other reviews that expressed disappointment in the hotel because of construction noise and temperature problems. All I can say is we didn't experience any of those or any problems at all. I would say the hotel does have difficult access to the front door by car. The hotel is in a pedestrian zone. We parked our car at an underground lot about 3 blocks away. I would not recommend driving to the hotel. We returned our car to the Atocha train station a few days before we left the city and saved money on car rental and parking. The hotel staff did reserve an Airport Shuttle for us which worked out great. It was $19 for the 3 of us.

<Content>Great value! We were in Madrid for only 2 nights before returning to the US so we wanted a central location and we got it! When the cab dropped us at the hotel we were really worried - grafitti all over plywood borded windows! The lobby was being remodeled and smelled like wet sheetrock. However we were pleasantly surprised when we opened the door to our room. It was huge and the bathroom had been remodeled and was also very large and all marble. For 105 euros for a triple we found it to be far superior to any of the other hotels we had stayed at during the previous two weeks in Spain  Portugal. We found the staff to be helpful and courteous. They even arranged for a cab to pick up our daughter at 3:00 am for her very early morning flight. We would definitely return to this hotel.

<Content>War Zone To say the hotel looks like a war zone is a little understatement. To say the staff is unhelpful is also an understatement. To say they could care less about the room tempertature ( two of the three rooms were never below 30), making airline confirmations, getting a shuttle to the airport would be right-on. We stayed in six hotels in Spain and Portugal in the same price range and this by far was the worst experience. This hotel should be avoided at all costs. Perhaps it will be better by 2008 !

<Content>I'd Look Elswhere Just returned with my son from Spain and Portugal and had a stay in Hotel Europa in Madrid. I was shocked when we entered the bomb-blasted lobby. I can't see any excuse for such a shabby appearance because they're remodeling! The room itself was fine, but as another reviewer said the hotel cafe is shut down for remodeling. In addition, construction noise is ongoing during the day in the hotel as a result. Puerta Del Sol has been removed and replaced with construction barrier. Heavy machinery runs into the night, so if you are a light sleeper, forget about rest. I think it's pretty poor of an establishment not to inform--on its web page--about the remodeling in the hotel instead of surprising them on arrival. I wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Look beyond the lobby for a great value and room After fighting mid-day Madrid traffic, we arrived at the hotel and thought we had made a horrible mistake. Taped up signs directed us to the entrance to the hotel and the lobby looked more like a flop-house entrance. I'm not even sure it has a front door. As I dropped my wife and son off to find parking I had a horrible feeling that we were going to have to cancel our reservation and hoof it to find another place. I told my wife to check out the room while I parked.As I walked back to the hotel my wife and son were smillingly calling to me from a balcony on the third floor telling me the room was perfect - which it was when I got to it. The hotel is definitely undergoing renovations, but they seemed to have completed the rooms and are just working on the lobby, entrance and adjacent restaurant.These are the most spacious rooms we've had on our trip. Comfortable beds, large, clean baths with showers, satellite TV, and Internet (bring your own network cable to plug in). You are steps from the Puerta del Sol and all the major shopping stores in Madrid. Halfway between the Prado and the Royal Palace, this is a perfect location for enjoying Madrid on foot.We were not told to expect breakfast in the 120 euro price, so I didn't notice the lack of the restaurant as others said. I didn't even realize the restaurant was mentioned highly in other travel guides until we were here. There is no shortage of restaurants of all kinds within easy walking distance. Even my first glimpse of a European Dunkin' Donuts!The only drawback I'd note is that the excellent map on their website can be a bit misleading. Directions are accurate, but the side streets they indicate to the hotel are pedestrian roads. You can drive down them to deliver passengers and luggage without any problem from the locals (though you do get funny looks from the other tourists!)I highly recommend this hotel for the rooms and quiet atmosphere in a bustling part of Madrid. If you judge a hotel by the lobby this may not be the place for you, but for all the rest it's great. Stay here for sure!

<Content>Misleading Advertising The hotel lobby is completely torn up, and the restaurant (highly acclaimed in travel guides and on the website) is under construction -- aka CLOSED. No food available through any means, even though there is a full menu in the room. The entrance to the hotel looks like a war zone. They make no mention of this construction project in their communication.There was construction noise quite regularly during each day.On the plus side -- We requested a balcony and received a great one -- on the first floor overlooking the main street. If you get such a room, it will make up for almost everything. The rooms are nicely renovated and clean.The best feature aside from the perfect location was the soundproof balcony shutter system. The walking crowd can be very loud and exciting. It's great to be able to shut it out and sleep when you need to.We found the staff to be great once you get acquainted after a couple days. And they did a great job getting our luggage to the taxi on the square...I can tell that when the hotel's back to normal, the restaurant open and the lobby repaired, it's probably the best hotel in town. Ask for a good balcony location...

<Content>OK, but not perfect Perfect location. The staff did no tell us, although we checked, there were no breakfast-room available because of reconstructions. Generally quite unpleasant/unhelpful staff.

<Content>Excellant location, great value This hotel is in an excellant location. The staff are not overly friendly - but I didn't go to Madrid to visit them. The hotel is exactly what you want on a weekend away to Madrid. The room is big, very clean, laminate floors which were also very clean. It's a bit of a rabbit warren to get to the room - but the hallways etc are also well kept. Our room had two large windows, both over looking the street - we enjoyed watching all the street sellers cautiously selling their pirate dvds etc... while also watching for the police - they had an impressive getaway system. The hotel is right on PLaza del Sol, and very near to PLaza Mayor, the area is very safe and great for going out at night. As the area is buzzing at night there is a lot of street noise- mainly people chatting, but the rooms are insulated enough to exclude most noise. It's also right beside the subway station.Some people may be disappointed with the entrance lobby - it is a tad shabby compared to the rooms. But don't judge a book by it's cover, the rooms are recently renovated and it's nice to see that the money was spent on the rooms rather than the lobby where you don't spend any time.I travelled with my fiance - we were both delighted with it and would definitely stay here on a return trip to Madrid.

<Content>Good location, good value The hotel was good, rooms were clean, nice bathroom, not expensive, we payed 75 euro's for a twin room. It's very centrally located in the city, a lot is in walking distance and there are bus and metro stops around the corner. The only thing I d'dnt really like was the very busy and noisy Puerta del Sol where the hotel is located. The double glass windows keep out most of the noise, but not all.I might stay here again next time I'm in Madrid, because it's good value this clean and centrally located hotel.

<Content>Europa a great choci in Madrid Stayed at the Europa for 3 nights at the beginning of February. Excellent location right in the centre of Madrid, very convenient for shops, bars, restaurants. The rooms were very good, amazing value for money having recently been renovated. There was still some construction in progress so the lobby and stairway were messy. This is a bit off putting when you first enter the hotel. There was some building noise during the day but it didn't cause us a problem.

<Content>Great Location and Good Value for Money My wife and I stayed at Hotel Europa in Puerta del Sol area of Madrid, Spain for 2 night in Feb 2006. It was a good deal at 80 euros per night for a very clean room and a great bathroom. The hotel is undergoing some redesign and construction so the hallways etc aren't that great but our room had been renovated etc so was good. The bedsheet was bad though (torn at 2 places). The hotel is centrally located and a stone's throw from all the activity. We enjoyed it a great deal.

<Content>Impressive for the cost... I was impressed with the room we had for 75 Euros (a double standard room) - I would definitely stay there again. It was large, remodeled, very clean and had a wonderful bathroom and the service was decent. Someone at the hotel even helped us with bringing our luggage to the room - I've traveled to budget hotels all over Europe and never had that happen! They even had room service available for food (but we didn't take advantage of it).The location is fantastic - right in the middle of Puerta del Sol (the heart of Madrid)...can't beat it. However, there were a few downsides (although I believe these will eventually go away):- There was a thermostat on the wall, but it wasn't working. It was quite cold in Madrid when I was there and the only heat was a heater on the floor which we plugged in, but it wasn't enough heat for the entire room. But, extra blankets were in the closet, which helped a bit.- Beds were a little firmer than I would normally prefer - slept ok, but woke up a little sore.- Be cautious of the construction going on at the hotel. They were working from about 7:30 a.m. til nearly 8 p.m. on weekdays - and it was quite loud. We could not sleep late in the morning and it was impossible to take a little nap in the afternoon. We walked around Madrid feeling pretty tired as a result of the construction noise.

<Content>What a Great Value! I stayed at the Hotel Europa on two separate occasions last October and all I can say is, Wow! Its location is perfect; the rooms are comfortable and super clean; and the staff is simply fantastic. It is undergoing some remodeling, but that did not interfere with the good-night sleep I had on both occasions. I could not hear the outside noise either. On the last night I was there, I had dinner at the hotel's restaurant. The waiters were courteous and helpful when asked for suggestions, the service impeccable, the dinner simply great. I now know this is the place to stay whenever I'm in Madrid.
