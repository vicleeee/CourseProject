<Content>Lovely, quiet room, great location A great location, at the southern end of the main shopping strip, across the road from the beach (I admit, you have to walk through markets to get to the beach), but you have to admire the Balinese for making the most of every available shopping oppurtunity!! Breakfast is great, lots of variety. I read lots of reviews saying the breakfast was not very good, but there was plenty of selection when we went. Staff are very friendly, reception often very busy though, can be quite a wait with only two staff on, minor problem though. Great choice of restaurants nearby and Waterbom park is just down the road. Our room was very clean, we had a room in the multi-story building, these rooms are bigger than the rooms on the left side of the pool. We had a balcony as well, which always had a lovely cool breeze.

<Content>hit the jackpot We chose the Ramayana as our third stop on a three week holiday in Bali. When we arrived, we were informed that although we had a booking for two rooms, the resort was full and they would have to upgrade us to the Resort Club on the top floor, a relatively new addition to the resort. The rooms were fantastic, very large with king size four poster beds, big screen tvs, dvd players, and luxury fittings. The staff were great (particularly Tina) and very patient with our teenage sons bb gun madness taking place every day in the rooms. Breakfasts were great with plenty of variety and the front pool was a hit being about 2.5m deep. Very central location and the stadium sports bar is also an added bonus. Would go back again and again. We swore by the Jayakarta previously but think the Ramayana out did it on this occasion.ruth and robert australia

<Content>Never again We stayed in the Poolside Cottages and as soon as we walked in the room like a punch in the face it stunk of a combination of urine and smoke!!!! This was supposed to be their premium level room(I would hate to see the basic one), also for two days in a row our room was not cleaned by housekeeping.The best thing about the Ramayana was the Central location, however as we were leaving(after being advised we could checkout late) the Manager said we should pay USD50 extra for late checkout I explained the situation he replied be saying that if we didnt pay the extra charge that he would either keep our Luggage or call the police to throw us in Jail!!!!We begrudgingly paid the extra to say that we would never return to Ramayana again, avoid at all costs.

<Content>Excellent Stay Me  my husband went to Bali in Sept for a week. We stayed at Deluxe room and was VERY dissapointed with the room. Quality of the room was very bad: smelly wood in the bathroom, smelly pillows and bed is not comfortable. The room is quite small. we upgraded the room to highest suite: Crown Club Suite for extra $US 300 for 5nites. The room was very nice and huge. The room has work desk, balcony with sofa, sofa at the corner of the room, 2 closets, bathrobes, HUGE bathroom with its individual shower,bath tub  toilet. Plus, we received free 30min massage, evening cocktails and Hi-Tea everyday but didnt get a chance to use it because we were too busy doing outdoor stuff. Overall, the hotel is very nice.The restaurant is clean and the food is alright. Western and local food. The hotel is just right in front of Matahari Shopping mall, the cheapest stuff u can get and only walking distance to shops. 5 mins walk to the beach so it was all good! I would recommend my friends n family to stay at Ramayana

<Content>Disappointed I booked this hotel on arrival at the international airport in Bali and paid $100USD per night for a Deluxe Suite. I was disappointed with the room given that my expectations were for a 4 star hotel. (I would not book on arrival at airport again.) The nightclub and bars were directly across the road from me and it was difficult to sleep with the noise. (I was moved to another room with a garden view, and again the room was very average.) The Deluxe rooms are unimpressive, and of a very average standard... they are shabby, and definitely only 3 star.Service is okay.There are better hotels that cost less like the Adi Dharma Hotel, (get a poolside room).I would not recommend this hotel given the price of $100USD per night.

<Content>Never again - very dissappointed. When we arrived at the Ramayana they didn't find our reservation. We booked online via an internet travel agency. Later it became clear they booked me under my front name. When we got to our deluxe room - we were really dissappointed again. The room was quite dark and outdated. The bathroom is worn and shabby. The worse however were the beds. It is just a simple wooden plate with a very old and worn matrass. Sitting on the bed we hit the wood underneat the old and worn matrass immediately. We were sure we couldn't sleep on that.Therefore we asked to change the matrass - answer: no can do!We wanted to change rooms - okay - matrasses just as bed! We decided to agree, since it was only one night before we left.The complimentary water in the room was already opened en half empty, so we had to call reception for a new fresh bottle.The towels were not clean, and after taking a bath, the whole bathroomfloor became soaked, since the water came up from a hole in the floor (draining system).We asked for a wake up call since we had an early flight out of Bali - never got the call.We asked for a breakfast box - we got it - but it was ridiculous - for a 4 star hotel you won't expect 2 very small sweets, 1 boiled egg, butter and jam, and a small apple (no napkin, no plastic knife, no drink). How do I put butter on this small sweets? Do I eat my boiled egg with the apple or with the sweet? Not worth the 4 star rating. The pool is very small and has very little chairs around it.We had to pay 15.000 rps for a short local phonecall, where the other hotels in Kuta only charged us 3000.They reception people we found not friendly. I have stayed in the Lokha Legian for much less money and we enjoyed it much better. It was not a good experience for us. I wouldn't recommend this place.

<Content>Great choice!!! We moved to Ramayana after spending 2 bad nights at Kuta Beach Club's dirty room. It was a great decision. The checking in and the checking out was a breeze... Ramayan is centrally located and the staff were friendly and welcoming. We were glad that the room was very clean. We stayed in the Deluxe room and it was quite roomy since we travelled with our 17months old son. However, I think the hallway were very daunting because of the minimal light. It was quite creepy when I walked down the hallway by myself at night to get our dinner from Asian Spice. The room service was quite affordable and prompt. We particularly liked the breakfast staff as they were fantastic. One particular breakfast staff member has made us feel special. We didn't get his name except that we know he's from Java and has travelled to Melbourne before. A big thank you to him. Overall Ramayan is a great resort to stay at whether you're travelling with family or as couple or alone. If we were ever to come back to Bali, we will stay at Ramayan again. Thank you to all the staff.

<Content>Spa leaves much to be desired I used the spa at the Ramayana (Kawas spa), and it fell below expectations. First, I paid in cash, and when I asked for a receipt, the staff said that their cahier was not around. Second, the spa is not air-conditioned, and the ventilation is poor. I perspired throughout my 2 hour session. Finally, I was bitten on my arms and legs by mosquitoes which were in the treatment room!I would not recommend the spa to anyone.

<Content>loved it My sister myself and my 4 year old son stayed here for 17 nights and can not complain. We had the most relaxing time and stayed in the wing overlooking the Kuta Markets some people have complained about street noise in these rooms, however we found very minimal noise. We have travelled to bali alot in the past 15 years staying at diferent hotels on each trip and can highly recomend Ramayana for comfort relaxation and a great location to everything you could possibly need. Bottom line we loved the hotel and the Staff. We will be staying there again with out question.

<Content>Pleasant Hotel, Good Location We stayed 4 days at this hotel in Dec 2006. The location of the Ramayana was excellent being just a short walk away from Kuta town centre and the beach. We found the staff including the reception guys to be friendly and accommodating; checking in went through with a breeze. Breakfast which was included in the room price was ok but not great.The AC in the first room we were shown into was not working well and we had to request for a room change. Although we stayed in the block above the Stadium coffee house, it was sufficiently quiet at night. There was a good discount for hotel guests on the Spa facilities which we took advantage of.On the whole, we found the Ramayana to be an average reasonably priced hotel.

<Content>Seen better I am a travel agent and had my first visit to Bali a few days ago. Being an agent we had to inpect many hotels, and spent our last night at the Ramayana. It wasnt nearly as nice as the other places we stayed, and the rooms are quite old. The hallways are very dark and unwelcoming. Our room overlooked the school which made it very noisy in the day. Other areas of the hotel are ok, and the poolside cottages look much better than other rooms, we were in the deluxe room on the 4th floor and you expect deluxe rooms to be much nicer. Most of the staff were ok, although they tried to charge us for bottled water in our room which they said we had opened but not drank, which seems pretty silly. Great location, but I wont stay here again.

<Content>Read This ..... Me and my collegues stay at this hotel from 27-30 Jun 2007. Good part of this hotel is very good location. 2 minutes walk to beach, shops just in front of the hotel. Our room was clean and it was quite big. Staff were polite.My disappointed with this hotel :1. Key to the room is still using manual, not the automatic one. So this is trouble when my roomate prefer to sleep earlier while I love to see around. They do offer me to open the door when I returned to the hotel but it took me 10 minutes to wait for them to open the room2. Hand towel is only available upon request in which I think this one should be a standard for such hotel.3. They only have 1 lift which only could accomodate +/- 10 person and work very very very slowwwww. For us who has just returned from rafting, this is a trouble as none of us able to use stair. The lift also have cat [--] from other visitor sandals. They clean it but the odor still stay.4. Breakfast is okay, but during 3 days stay, 1 day they lack of fried onion. Another day, they said they don't have soya ketchup which to us is terible to have porridge without it.5.The worst of all. Since I still breastfeeding my son, on the last day I ask my breastmilk to be stored in their freezer to catch afternoon flight. I repeated again and again to 2 staff but yet when I get back my breastmilk, it was only cold and not turn to ice.Will I stay again in this hotel ? I will say no as other hotel also offer same courtesy with cheaper price, but the stupid staff who handle my breast milk really ruin all of the good impression.

<Content>Rooms for improvements! We stayed 6 nights at the poolside cottage, this hotel although strategically located but that's about it, the service is mediocre in comparisons with general Indonesian hospitality, money minded and not-so-polite feedback upon asking assistance from reception, etc. Rooms are ok but the air circulation is quite bad, had some breathing problems during our stay, overall i had a bad impression and won't recommend it for anyone. The hotel offers a nice crowds though, made some friends during our stay.. lots of rooms for improvements i should say!

<Content>Central to shops, nightlife, restaurants etc. We stayed here for 5 nights in a pool side cottage, the room was fantastic. We were only about 5 metres from the pool. They are renovating the restaurant at the moment but we didn't hear any noise at all from the building site. The Stadium bar where we ate breakfast every morning has the best meals around and if you are a sport fan there is sport playing on of the number of big screens nonstop there is sure to be something to interest you. This hotel is just a few minutes walk from Matahari and Kuta Square and only about a 10 minute stroll to Discovery Plaza Shopping Centre. You can get to the beach down a laneway opposite the hotel about 2 minute walk. I loved this place because it is so central to everything.

<Content>Convenient Location - Good Value Hotel Booked this hotel at the last minute and got a good deal on a deluxe room. The best thing about the hotel is the central location. If you are looking at a midrange hotel in Kuta - this is a pretty good choice. It's an easy walk to the beach and Hard Rock Area and also a quick walk to nearby shops and restaurants. The lobby, garden and large hotel pool are all very nice. The rooms are dated and nothing very spectacular - but they are clean and efficient. Small problems with the air-conditioner and the plumbing in the bathroom. There isn't too much noice and the staff is very helpful and they maintain good security throughout the property. The breakfast is full indonesian and american buffet - again just okay. For the location, facilities and price you really can't go wrong spending a few days here.

<Content>Fantastic Balinese hospitality Have stayed in this hotel 5 times in as many years and it has got better and better.Of all the rooms,for the price,the super deluxe are the best value.Another reviewer said they wanted to stay in the poolside cottage but I would advise against it.We stayed in the poolside cottages last year and found that the balconies get unbearably hot and even with the fan running there is no air movement,making it imposssible to sit out in comfort. The hotel is normally busy and this can mean a lack of sunbeds but the hotel say they are going to upgrade the pool area and include more beds.All in all a great hotel in an ideal location (we must love it we got married in the hotel in september 2004).

<Content>My stay at Ramayana I am a local Indonesian. On last October 2005, me and my wife stayed in Ramayana Hotel kuta for about three nights. We took the Superior room. Our visit just took around 4 days after the 2nd Bali Bombing, so the security in that hotel is kinda tight (but in that moment I think security in all other places around Kuta is the same tight as in this hotel). They were renovating their main lobby back in that time. Perhaps it will be done by now.There are several plus points I found out for this hotel. First, they have a very strategic location. Located across the DVD stores, 2-3 mins walk from the Kuta beach and Kuta square, and just a short walk to the Discovery Mall. You will also find transport easily, because taxis all are around, and there are also several car/motorbike rentals near by.Second, if you stay in superior room like we did (behind the big pool if you step in from main entry), you fill find that it's quiet enough inside the hotel. Good ambience to relax I think. Third, they offer a good value compared to some other three stars hotels.But for being fair, I also found some minus points. First, during the second night the aircon in our room is completely broken (on first night it's still working but not cool enough, finally they relocated us to another superior room). Second, I think the garden they have kinda block the sunshine into some rooms (including ours), so we feel our room a little bit damp. Third, during breakfast there were not too many kind of food to be offered. From scale 0 to 10, I might give the breakfast score 6.5So if you are couple or small family looking for a strategic and good value place while discovering Kuta and Legian. It is a recommended place.

<Content>Bali Trip My wife and I stayed at the Ramayana for 3 nights in December 2005. Overall the hotel was very centrally located to anything you want. We were on the 3rd floor in room # 735. The room was very nice. There was a misterious odor in the hall on our level, but I was not in our room, but we did have to walk past it. Kuta and all of Bali is struggling bad after the recent bombings. The hotel there are at about 10% capacity (meaning you can get very good deals). We paid about $45 a night. In Indonesia everything is negotiable. I found they have 2 prices, one for foreigners and one for indonesians. I found this out by using my wife (she is Indonesian). Bali was a little depressing with all the empty cabs with no customers always asking you for a ride. It also rained every day in bali (check the season before you go - we were in the rainy season). Also watch out at tourist areas (temples, beaches, native dances, etc...) you will be mobbed by local women and men trying to sell you anything from t-shirts to marijuana. Also keep a close guide on your belongings, during one of these mobbing my wife had a cellphone taken. After Kuta we stayed for two nights in Ubud. Ubud is much quieter than Kuta and very beautiful. I recommend for transportation to rent a car with a driver for the day. We got a car with a driver for $25 a day. That did not include the gas we had to spend (around $8.00). With your car and driver you can go anywhere.The most interesting part of the trip to bali was the bike ride on a cycling tour in Ubud. 25 kilometers through some of the prettiest cournty in the world. The tour is not a mountain biking trip and it is very easy. 99% downhill. We stopped several times to visit a spice store, gardens, rice paddies, local household to see how the locals lived, etc... All the local kids would great you on the street saying Hello and waving you on. This was not on busy roads, but on the backroads. Traffic was very light. For $36 we got breakfast overlooking lake Bater and a volcano, lunch at a local indonesian resturant and the easiest bike I've ever been on. Our tour guide was Darma (a great guy).

<Content>Very Central Location My husband and I spent a week at the Ramayana this month. We had paid for a Deluxe room facing the pool but on arrival we were given a room facing Kuta Square. Thinking this might be a bit noisy, we asked to be moved and they gave us a Executive Deluxe Room which was really lovely. Location wise, if you want to be in the heart of Kuta - this is the most central place. Two swimming pools, both beautiful. I would have loved to stay in the poolside cottage but they were all booked out when we were there. Rooms were fantastic - king size canopy bed - tv with dvd player.I couldn't fault the place and would stay here again. (But hopefully in the poolside cottage). I also had a massage which was nice but a bit pricey even for hotel standards.They are in the process of building a new lobby so the noise from that was a tad annoying - especially when I was having a massage - but it will be lovely when it's all finished.This is a lovely central hotel, clean with helpful staff. I would recommend it for anyone, couples, families, business people.
