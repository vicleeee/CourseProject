<Content>Great location, but don't open your window This was our second hotel on the Rick Steves' tour and it was the worst of the bunch. I don't know if it was the time of the year or the location but our room was full of mosquitos and also a few fleas. Everyone in our group had issues with bugs. The front desk will provide an insect repellant that is a plug-in, which I didn't find out about until the last night, but it worked great. Otherwise the location and staff were superb. You are within easy walking distance of the Duomo, Accademia and Central Market(Mercato Centrale). The room itself was fine though a little tight, but the bathroom was huge for Italian standards. The bed was fine and the room had a TV with CNN if you are interested in keeping up with current events while in the magical city of Florence. Breakfast is included, the usual fare of rolls, croissants, fruit, cheese, cold cuts, yogurt and cereal, with coffee, tea and juice.

<Content>Ideal location for train station and Dormo side of florence Stayed one night as a stop over whilst travelling from Siena to Rimini.The hotel is less than a 10min walk from the train station in an ideal location for the Dormo side of town.The late booking of a double room upgrade for the price of a single was a very good price.The steps to enter the hotel may not suite some people and the roadworks at the minute makes it into an obstacle course to reach. Any noise though cannot be heard within the hotel.The double room / bathroom were clean, average size but nice and cool with the air-conThe facilities are very basic for the breakfast plus the outside area to sit in after a long day is just a very small enclosed courtyard with a table.For price and a nights stay at this hotel it is quite a good option. Anything longer I personally would look for better outdoor facilities and breakfastIt is ideal though for leaving your bag after checking out and picking up on your way back to the train station after a days exploring.

<Content>Good hotel - great location Nice hotel - very friendly, helpful staff. We were referred to this hotel by the Hotel Centrale which was full. Staff here went out of their way to help us. They had no triples so gave us a double and then later moved out a desk and added an extra bed for our son. Since they were booked solid the next night, they found us a room across the street at a three star hotel for the same price.Hotel room was nice and bathroom a decent size. Extra blankets were provided along with shampoo, safe, etc... Only negative was that the road in front Via Faenza was under constructon and had awful sewer smell. Also hotel layout is a bit of a maze and there is a charge for Internet. Also no elevator so you must carry luggage up stairs. Other than that, a great hotel.

<Content>Great staff, very warm welcome !! We have spent 5 nights at the Hotel Accademia and as soon as we got at the reception we knew that we were at the right place to have a great vacation in Florence. We have had a very warm and frendly welcome and the staff was able to answer at all our questions, as soon as we got there, about how spending our time in their city. They speak fluent english. They also helped us to make reservations for some museums.The room was big and clean. The breakfast was very abundant.We can not believe that this Hotel is only 2 star !!The rate that we had was really not high comparing to the service that we have had.If you think that the Hotel Accademia is in the house of Bernardo Cennini (sculptor of the 15th century) you really can not think to chose a better place.We hope to come back there as soon as we can. We highly recommend this Hotel !!!!

<Content>Location okay, property small and slightly dated, breakfast mediocre We stayed at this hotel in late December 2007. The desk attendants were always friendly, and always available when we returned (you leave key at front desk). I found the decor to be a little mediocre, which perhaps affects one's view of the hotel. The location was very good, and if you don't plan to spend your time in the hotel, then it is convenient both to the train station, the outdoor shopping stalls, and the other sites (all the main sites seemed to be within 5-10 minute walks). The breakfast provided was not of the same quality of other hotels we stayed in during our overall time in Italy. Each morning, there would be a place setting for about 20 people or so, consisting of a hard roll and a croissant (brioche). There were some standard choices as well, but I would skip the breakfast if you can get some discount off the room rate. Bathroom was cramped. One morning the water pressure ran out in the shower.

<Content>Greatly enjoyed the Hotel Academia This hotel was recommended in Rick Steve's tour guide and we checked it out and were very pleased. The staff was excellent, spoke passable English, and very friendly. The night desk clerk even waited up for us the night we missed the last train out from Venice. Unforturnately, we had to spend the night in Venice and didn't make it back until the next morning. He said he was worried that something bad had happened to us.The room and bathroom were large and and very clean and comfortable and faced an enclosed terrace. Although we were five minutes from the train station and around the corner from the street market it was very quiet.We were so pleased that we stayed 6 days instead of 2 and took day trips from the convenient train station. Felt very safe and welcome in Florence, as opposed to Rome!

<Content>GREAT Location Great location! Located in the historic district, just a short walk from the Duomo. Nice hotel and the rooms were okay. Avoid rooms 1  2...they are right at the front desk and you hear EVERYTHING all nightlong...the bathrooms in these two rooms are very tiny...to put it bluntly...you never have to get up to do anything...your feet rest comfortably on the shower drain...need I say more. Our travel partnershad a room in the back...16, I think...and it was very large and quiet...with a BIG bathroom.

<Content>Great Location - Just Ok Room Stayed here based on Rick Steve's recommendations. It was in a great location and the staff was very friendly but I felt the rooms left a lot to be desired. They said the rooms were recently renovated but ours just seemed old. It was clean but the parquet floors and the dingy yellow bed cover made the room just blah. It wasn鈥檛 a room I wanted to stay in for more than sleeping. Even for European standards, this was slightly below average.

<Content>Great location To say this hotel was supposed to be only two stars I think it truly surpassed itself! The hotel was a little hidden but the reception area was really pleasant. The hotel was spacious and laid out almost villa like which we thought was lovely. The room was much bigger than the one in Rome. The bed was large and comfortable. The room had very nice air-conditioning which was quiet enough to have on all night. The bathroom was a little strange as the sink, shower and toilet was separated. the shower was excellent and was in its own little room. the location was also excellent and very close to all the main sights.We did not have breakfast included, but the hotel was excellent, the staff friendly and helpful except at the end when we were told that we had to pay by cash very rudely. But everyone else seemed helpful and friendly. That was really the only issue we had, because they did not tell us we had to pay in cash and were a little rude about it. I would stay here again and recommend it!

<Content>Location, Location, Location We stayed at the Hotel Accademia as part of a Rick Steves tour. (LOVED the tour, but that is another review!) This hotel is centrally located to EVERYTHING. Not only the artistic sites, museums, and churches, but also restaurants and shops.  We had a great room (quiet) with a double bed (#15). However, some of our tour group did encounter a) noise from street facing rooms and b) the shower over the toilet. I suggest if you book this hotel, you mention these problems in your booking request. Also, our tour guide told us NOT to use the launderettte down the street from the hotel (some prior tour members had their clothes cooked in the dryer!). There is another small convenient launderette near the hotel, ask the staff for further directions. Gelato across the street and Michelangelo right around the corner! Can it get any better??????

<Content>the Accademia a great location This hotel is located near the San Lorenzo market for open air shopping at the numerous vendor stalls selling everything:shoes, clothing, jewelry, and leather. The Mercato Centrale is a few minutes away. The Duomo, train station and some other sites are not too far. Also a good restaurant is located next door. The staff makes this place a great place to stay. They are very helpful and bend over backwards to accommodate you. The rooms are clean and the cleaning staff does a great job.

<Content>Hotel quality expected for Europe We stayed for three nights in May. The hotel was about average Location was great! The bathroom is a bit small in width even for Europe. Was fairly clean. There is construction next door that made for very loud mornings. Lots of noise in the streets early in the mornings as well.

<Content>A good compromise We have just spent 2 days in this hotel. Florence is a very expensive town so the accademia hotel is a great compromise for those who doesn't want to spend all their budget in the hotel. Before going to Italy we had checked the price on the hotel website and it was 75鈧?per night for the first week of January but we did not book. Once arrived at the hotel, the price suggested by the receptionist was 90鈧? After a couple of minutes we finely paid 75鈧?per night.The room was charmless but extremely clean, calm and spacious (as well as the private bathroom). The hotel is located in the historical center of the town so it very convenient..The only think that we did not appreciate was the price of the garage (24鈧?per day!!!!) whereas the hotel is supposed to have an agreement with this garage.  Except that everything was perfectly find.

<Content>Great experience! The Accademia is a quaint hotel with a lot of character and was a great place to stay - once we moved from a room that faced the street to one that faced the interior! Our first night, we were awoken at 4:00 am by the noise of vendors setting up and supplying the local shops. The staff were helpful in setting us up with another room. The rooms were spacious and the bathrooms very nice and well-equipped. We visited in December and it was cold, and we found that by law they could only run the heat certain hours of the day - so by American standards it was a bit chilly. The staff were very helpful and reasonably fluent in English. The breakfast, included in the rate, was OK. The hotel is situated in a great area if you like to shop; a major clothing and tourist merchandise market is only a block away; it is also situated well for those who prefer exploring the art and architecture of Florence. We would stay there again - if we could book the quiet rooms.

<Content>Great budget hotel I stayed at this hotel recenty as part of a small tour, they also accomodated my extra nights. The hotel is in a great location. 5 minute walk from train station and just a few minutes away from most major sites. Just off the Piazza for the Medici Chapel.My room was in the back and I packed a little heavier than I should have so did have to drag my luggage around. Each room is a little different. Mine was average size by European standards with a small bathroom. My shower was directly over the toilet but it was fine for a single person. Wouldn't want to share this kind of bathroom as drying off the toilet for the next person would be a pain. Other people in our group had larger rooms, and really nice bathrooms. The window overlooked a small tiny courtyard, and while there wasn't much exterior light, it was nice and dark at night. I didn't have much outside noise. Yes, other windows are close, but I kept the exterior shutters closed and it wasn't a problem. Some of the folks in the front had street noise at night. Breakfast was fine. Pretty basic but more than adequate. Breakfast isn't a big meal in Italy so save yourself for lunch  dinner. The staff are all incredibly gracious. Remember to leave your key at the front when you leave the hotel. In Italy you aren't meant to take the key with you. We learned from our guide, that in Italy the electricity is government regulated so most air conditioning and heat doesn't operate 24 hours a day. They will turn off at night - additionally, no mater what, you will never get your room American cold with the AC in the summer so don't even try.They do provide hair dryers if you need it, and I'd recommend that you bring your own soap, shampoo etc. Also, the wine bar on the right corner is fabulous and has great sandwiches, coffee and wine. Internet cafe just down the street (left) is convenient as is the great little market left -then left again.

<Content>Good budget hotel I stayed in this hotel on July 2006 with my partner. The hotel is a good budget choice, our room was clean and ok. The hotel is a bit worn but it didn't bother us. The staff was nice. Breakfast could have been better, it consisted of bread roll, juice, coffee/tea. Also the air condition in our room didn't work as well as it could have worked.Our room lacked natural light - our window was looking on a sort of chasm which was quite dark also during the daytime - and opposite to our window there was a window to another room which was only about 2 metres away so we didn't want to keep the shutter open. The location of this hotel is very central, it is only about 5-10 minutes away from central train station and Il Duomo by walk.

<Content>Ok Hotel - People were Nice Property Location: Centrally located - 15 minute walk from train station, Duomo and Central Market. There are no elevators in the hotel and there is also a long flight of stairs before you get to the reception. So if you have a lot of luggage or heavy luggage you should take this into account.The room we had was not very large but the AC worked and we were there in October but the weather was summer-like and the AC was very necessary. As well, there were mosquitoes so we could not sleep with the windows open (plus the noise some nights gets quite loud - we had earplugs with the windows closed and could still hear). **We were told that Florence is mosquito-y in general and that it is not a problem necessarily with this hotel.There is no Internet access for guest use - but there are internet cafes nearby (5 minutes walk). You will need your passport to gain internet access in Italy (anti-terrorism laws).The bath room was small, toiletries given was very basic. The bathroom can emit and odor so remember to shut the door when u leave the hotel - and that seemed to help a lot.All in all, the hotel is very basic (from the breakfast, rooms, bathrooms etc.), but the central location and helpful front desk people were great. I think this hotel is especially perfect for those of the mindset that the hotel is just a place to sleep in - you are not looking for luxury just the basic comforts and helpful front desk personnel.

<Content>Good place, Great Location The hotel is very conveniently located, a short walk from the SMN Railway station and the Duomo. Our room was big and the airconditioning worked well. The bathroom was also very big. We had an inside room on the first floor, so not too much climbing and no noise, though no outside view either. The breakfast was good, usual croissants, cheese, fruit etc. The management were very helpful especially Paolo and the smiling lady whose name I didn't catch. They made our bookings for the museums ( a must unless you like queueing up for hours ), helped us look for another hotel ( they were fully booked one night of our stay ) and even kept a bag for us for a couple of nights while we went visiting San Gimignano.Very convenient for a tourist, and would definately reccomend it.

<Content>Great hotel, great location I stayed one night at the Accademia Hotel, on my own, before meeting friends in Florence and touring Tuscany. I followed the directions on the website from the SMN station and fund the hotel easily. The staff were all very friendly and my room was lovely. I paid 75 Euros for a single room but actually had a double bed which was great. Bathroom was fabulous and I had air-con as well, which was a bonus because it was stonkingly hot in Florence that day!The hotel is up stairs and I was on the top floor with no lift, but that wasn't a problem for me. My room was very quiet with only the slamming of others doors to bother me (always take earplugs when sleeping in hotels lol!). The hotel is very well placed to wander around Florence but it's not in the 'best' parts of town but I felt perfectly safe wandering about in the late evening.I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I would stay again if visiting Florence again.

<Content>Decent hotel I stayed at this hotel as part of a tour in May 2006. It is in a great location for Florence, near the Central Market and walking distance to most of the main tourist sights. It is located next to the 鈥淢useum of Torture鈥?but don鈥檛 let that deter you, it makes it easier to find. Many, many US college students in the area, giving it a somewhat surreal feeling you鈥檝e not left home. On the plus side, Internet cafes all over the place. The rooms were very clean and pretty spacious (I was in a triple). Terribly noisy on garbage day because my room faced a street (others in the group had courtyard facing rooms and had no noise issues). Decent breakfast, although one morning the coffee was stone cold. There is a lovely internal courtyard to have a pre-dinner drink or just to relax.

<Content>Pleasurable experience We stayed at the Accademia for two nights, apparently special rate of 75 euros, which was nice after Rome prices. The hotel is within walking distance from the train station, and pretty much walking distance to everything else. Nice clean room, confusing hotel floor plan, good breakfast. Irish Pub a couple of doors up. We had no trouble with smells or noise. It was pretty cold in Florence in mid march. Hotel clerk turned us on to a great restaurant. I fell for the steak Florentine, which was a good steak, but just a char broiled porterhouse which you can get anywhere in the US. Not exactly the kind of food I went to Italy to experience. I would stay in this hotel again. Staff member ran out after us to give us an item of clothing that was left in room. A pleasant experience.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay Hotel Accademia was a nice hotel on a street that was well kept up. We stayed for 2 nights and the room was bright with nicely painted walls. The bathroom was wonderful with a light that was automatic. The room was small, which is expected but the bathroom was spacious. Breakfast was enjoyable with coffee, 1 roll, 1 croissant, coffee/juice, etc. I would definitely stay here again. Based on the previous review, perhaps we had an inside room. It was room 3 right off the main lobby, which was quiet. Note: There is a 1:00 am curfew.

<Content>Great hotel!! We stayed two nights in the Hotel Accademia in Florence, and we loved it there! Close to the station, lots of market stalls, and easy walking distance to everywhere else. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room clean and comfortable, the windows and shutters made the room very cool and quiet - we slept like logs. We would recommend this hotel and definitely stay there again.

<Content>Smelly Just returned from a fabulous trip to Italy but unfortunately the low point of the trip was the Hotel Accademia. The hotel seemed fine (room was ok, bathroom clean) but the sewer smell was overpowering. We thought maybe this was coming from the street but realized quickly that it was coming from the drains in the bathroom after we openned the door to the bathroom (the bathroom itself was clean, the smell was from the drains in the bathroom). Air conditioning was useless since it was impossible to be in the room without the windows open. Other areas of the hotel did not smell - it seemed to be only in the area around the room. Would suggest making sure the room does not smell before you consider a room here.

<Content>The front desk made an effort. Well, we were actually assigned the largest, quietest suite in the hotel. It was great except the smell of smoke was overpowering. We were moved to the very noisy, room next to the back alley. We asked to be moved again and was shown 2 other choices. We picked the room off the lobby and were very happy with the choice. That all happened in the 1st 2 hours. The hotel was not crowded so we were lucky to be able to switch. We did ask for non-smoking and the room was designated non-smoking but I guess policies aren't enforced. The room was pretty standard, the shower sprays all over the bathroom floor, but it worked out fine. The hotel itself is in a great location. We walked everywhere. The train station is a 5 minute walk. The hotel clerk recommended the Za Za restaurant and it was really great. The breakfast was fine, same as the other 2 hotels we stayed in. All in all it was a good experience.

<Content>Nice budget choice, but can be noisy We stayed here for 1 night. Pretty hotel in a remodeled old old building. Next to the medieval torture museum (kids laughed about that). Well located for sightseeing. (We arrived late afternoon and still made it into the Uffizi.) Up a long staircase to desk; beautiful stained glass entry (which we were told is locked late at night). We had a quad room which was plainly but nicely painted and decorated and was also quite clean. Ok - the bad parts - the neighborhood gets a bit dicey after about 9 or 10pm and the street noise continues loud pretty late. I told the kids to pretend someone had left the TV on to an HBO special: Druggies and their Motor Scooters. Much laughter before we finally got to sleep (which we did albeit later than normal). Would I stay here again? - sure, but I'd try for an interior room.

<Content>Noisy - could not sleep at all! My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Accademia for one night in early March, 2005. We did not have a reservation and walked there from the train station. Using Rick Steves book, we chose this hotel. We were pleasantly surprised when the desk clerk said it would only be 80 euros, but then we were put in room #2 overlooking a busy street. We thought we could handle the street noise, but around midnight, the samba club directly across the street started picking up. Around 3:30 am, my husband and I got up to look out the window because the noise was getting louder and louder. There were probably 100 or more partiers in the street directly under our window. Music, sirens, singing...it never stopped. The next day we moved to the delightfully quiet Residenza Il Villino and then wasted our first day in Florence napping at our new hotel. The Hotel Accademia was not on the side of the tourist area I would have preferred to stay on - Florence is nicer closer to the river or north of the duomo. The bed was uncomfortable. Things were clean, but the bedding was old and we had a hard time trying to figure out how to turn off the light in the bathroom. The staff was very nice, however. Not the worst hotel ever, and if you had an interior room it might be okay, but I would not stay here again.

<Content>Okay for the money... Stayed at the Hotel Accademia for 3 nights in mid November 2004. The room was decent, clean and relatively quiet. The bathroom was huge by Italy standards and very updated. The location was great, would stay here again.

<Content>Average for the price Stayed at a variety of hotels in Italy, Germany and Switzerland, most within the 100-150 Euro range, and this was probably the least attractive for the price (140 Euro). Had a quiet, clean room in the inner part of the building, air conditioning worked well, and was centrally located to sights and the train station. However, the room was among the most plain-looking of those we stayed in, and the bathroom left something to be desired. It was the only in this price range in which one shared the shower with a toilet. The floor plan, as Rick Steves mentions, is boggling and a little annoying for the tired traveler. One nice touch: the staff pointed us to a small stash of guide books they loaned for free to help appreciate the local museums.

<Content>not so sure about this one... We stayed for 2 nights at the end of August, and I'm not entirely sure that I would reccommend this hotel to anyone...The hotel itself was really neat-an old palace/mansion w/ a crazy floor plan. We stayed in room #1-Rooms #1 and #2 are right by the front desk-EXTREMELY noisy at night. The sheets were super scratchy and actually gave my husband and I both rashes, and the toilet ran all night long-I kept trying to convince myself it was a beautiful stream in a meadow-but w/ the front desk noise combined w/ a little jet lag sleep was difficult. But you get what you pay for-we only paid 90 euro a night. The other good things: Nice location, decent breakfast, good A/C.

<Content>Wonderful, small hotel We spent 10 days at Hotel Accademia in late April-May. Excellent location, quiet at night,very clean,great bed and bathroom;good breakfast,taxes and service included plus the hotel owner and staff are very helpful and gracious. Several excellent restaurants within easy walking distance:Trattoria Antellesi (right outside entrance to hotel) on Via Faenza and Porcuspino-(porcupine) trattoria around the corner. One of Rick Steeves tour groups stayed there for a few days. We walked all over the city, took public bus to Fiesole for the day and the train to Pietra Santa-marble carving area., and also joined a tour group to Siena and San Gimigniano for a day. Easy walk to train station. Hotel staff can get reservations for you at Uffizi, so no waiting in lines. We would strongly recommend this hotel .....
