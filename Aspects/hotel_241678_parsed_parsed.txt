<Content>Sleek and modern This hotel is in a prime location within walking distance of the Zocalo, Alameda Park and other tourist attractions. It is sleek, modern, clean and well managed. The room was large, nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable. The buffet food at the Dons Restaurant was very good, including a wide selection of Mexican and International dishes. There is also an excellent ala carte restaurant and a bar. Despite being somewhat characterless, we were very pleased with this hotel.

<Content>Good service and convenient location We stayed at the Sheraton for 3 nights at the beginning of our holiday in Mexico, and for 1 night at the end. We got a great deal on the 1st 3 nights with Expedia [albeit room only], less so for the last night which we booked at the last minute.We requested rooms on high floors, and were rewarded with superb views of the city from the 27th and 25th floors. The 27th floor room was huge, and the 25th floor room was big. They both seemed to have exactly the same amount of furniture in, which was a little odd. The bathtubs in both were a little small.As 1st-time visitors to the City, we chose this hotel for its convenient location. It is 10-15 minutes walk to the Zocalo, the Turibus stop is practically outside, and there are 2 Metro stations within a few minutes walk.We ate breakfast at Los Dones restaurant in the hotel. The choice was great and the service good, although we felt we would have got better value eating outside the hotel. We ate lunch cheaply at the Sol restaurant [1 block east] and supper twice at Sanbourns [1 block west] which was good fun and good value.We found the service to be generally excellent. Our spanish is very limited and all the staff we came into contact with spoke good english. The concierge was particularly helpful. He arranged onward bus travel to Oaxaca for us, and also advised on local buses to Teotihuacan.OK, it is a Sheraton, but we would certainly recommend this hotel for 1st-time visitors to the City.

<Content>Lacks character, and there is no comfort in it's uniformity Our 3 night stay at the Sheraton Centro Historico was ok. We found the hotel to be very clean and enjoyed the view from our room looking over Alameda Park from the 24th floor. This hotel is your typical chain hotel and if you close the curtains you could be in Anywhere, USA. The rooms were clean, I found the bathtub to be too small but other than that everything was satisfactory. Wireless internet is $10/day and VERY slow which I found irritating. The Staff are good, most speak English very well and are happy to help you, but regardless of good or bad service you have to pay that automatic 15% service tax on it! We enjoyed the buffet breakfast at Los Dones very much, and at 120 pesos for breads, cereal, fruit, different cheeses and cold cut meats and fresh juices it was a reasonable price. This was a nice hotel but I don鈥檛 think I would stay here again as I found the place to be a bit depressing. (The hotel is very darkly decorated and lacks individuality)

<Content>Has a lot going for it Though primarily a business hotel, this was one of the nicest hotels we've stayed at in Mexico as tourists. The location is great--right across the street from the Alameda and just blocks from many museums and historic churches. The buffet meals were all very good. My wife was especially impressed with the painstaking maid service.

<Content>Good hotel, good location Good hotel in very good location. It's walking distance to the Zocalo and there are metrostations nearby. We booked the cheapest room, but for some reason we got upgraded to a master suite on the 27th floor. The Sheraton is a huge business hotel, so if you're looking for a 'boutique experience', you might prefer someplace smaller. We also stayed at the Embassy suites (very nice hotel too), but the Sheraton is better value for money.

<Content>Pleased with the Sheraton Centro Historico I stayed 4 nights at the Sheraton Centro Historico and was pleased with this hotel overall.I got a very good rate from the Sheraton website. Upon check in, i received a high floor room, as requested, with a view towards the zocalo, which is about a 10-15 minute walk away.The best thing about this hotel for me were the restaurants. El Cardinal, just off the lobby, is packed from the moment it opens to the moment it closes (unfortunately, i'm not sure if it's open for dinner, but it's definitely good for breakfast and lunch at any time), and with reason: the food (Mexican) and service are amazing. Try the tamarind margaritas if you can. There's always at least a 30 minute wait but somebody told me afterwards that if you are a hotel guest, you might get priority on the waitlist. Even if you're not staying at this hotel, however, i highly recommend El Cardinal.There is also a restaurant on the 6th floor, with an adjoining rooftop terrace. It's a lovely serene environment with food that they call comfort and I would call mostly Italian. Again, great, fresh food, and a nice oasis in the city (open from 7am until 5pm). Both restaurants are open continuously, so you can have breakfast at 10:30am, or lunch at 3pm, if you like. This worked great with my erratic schedule.The rooms were fine, with the usual, comfortable Sheraton beds  Neutrogena amenities, but nothing to write home about. The wireless internet access was very weak, so i did end up getting a cable, which worked well. Charges for the internet were $10 per day. As for the complaints by other travelers, i found both pen and paper next to the telephones, a bathmat next to the bath, my mirror didn't steam up and the TV, while not the latest in technology, worked just fine. In addition, the service, from the front desk to the bellmen to the housekeeping staff, was professional and friendly.Unfortunately, the location --near the historic center -- was not the best for me, as I was here for work and ended up spending nearly all my time in Polanco, so I should have stayed there. Polanco is about a half hour's taxi ride away in traffic (and there is always traffic), so this became pretty inconvenient.

<Content>Nice, Friendly Place The Sheraton Centro Historico is a great location, the rooms are a nice size as well as clean and the staff is very helpful. The Sheraton is within walking distance of the Zocalo and other attractions like the Templo Mayor. The Metro stop is close as are a Starbucks and a Sanborns restaurant. Additionally, a Turibus stop is just a few blocks away.The room was a good size as well as clean. The bathroom is very modern. I found the staff very friendly and helpful whether it was checking-in, organizing a day-trip or just getting a taxi back to the airport.Overall, my experience with the Sheraton Centro Historico was a positive one.

<Content>Great hote,l good location My wife and I spent 4 night ,6/11 to 6/15 at the Sheraton. We were generally very happy with the room and service. As others have mentioned the hotel is in a good location with lots of sites with in walking distance. The concierge was friendly and helpful. The beds were very confortable. We only ate at one dinner at the hotel but it was good.We used the business center a few times but found is expensive, $3 per 15 mins. to use the internet.The staff did a good job cleaning the rooms but they seem to forget things. No bath mat the first day then one appeared, soap one day not the next, etc. These were only minor annoyances.We would definitely consider stay here on our next trip.

<Content>Centro Historico is central I recently stayed at the Sheraton Centro Historico and really had no complaints. It is centrally located between two Metro stations and is walking distance to Palacio de Bellas Artes, Zocalo, Templo Mayor and much more. As a gold level Starwood member I was offered free internet service, however, I was disappointed with the Wi-Fi connection and ended up having to get a cable plug-in. There is a nice gym but there is an additional charge for it. The concierge was extremely helpful and had an answer for every question we had. I had a city view but I would highly recommend getting a Park view instead.I used my Starwood points, so cannot comment on price.

<Content>Enjoyed the stay! This is a nice business class hotel on par with most new Hilton, Westin, etc. Beautiful lobby, spacious rooms, clean and comfortable beds, nice furniture and decor. The staff overall are friendly and helpful. Not everyone speaks English but most do. The location for this hotel is also very good. Easy access to all the historic sites and museums in downtown, easy access to food on all sorts of budgets (from excellent taco street stands to nice up scale restaurants in downtown). The metros (subways are also close by), with two stations on different lines in short walking distance. There is a $10/day charge for internet (wireless and wired). I was able to get a weak signal in the lobby for something from the Ciudad de Mexico (or similar SID). it's some kind of free wifi in beta version from the city. I had to register (free) to gain access. It worked but the signal was pretty weak at the hotel and speed was slow. I ended up paying the hotel for internet. For free wifi hot spot, I was able to get a free signal at the Cafe de Tacuba in centro historico. Anyway, great stay, will definitely stay here again if return to Mexico City.

<Content>Great location, room  Stayed here early May with my wife for 2 nights at the start of our holiday, driving through Mexico. The hotel's location is very good: central and next to some places that provide breakfast (Starbucks and an Italian restaurant). With a location in front of the Alameda park, it`s very walkable to the Bellas Artes, the Zocalo, Plaza Garibaldi, etc. With the metro stop Hidalgo very nearby, these and further destinations like the Museum of Anthropology and History are easy to reach (Zona Rosa is relatively nearby). That said, the hotel quality is nowhere near that of the JW Marriott in Polanco (further out), where I stayed some 3 years ago. The bed is good, as is the bathroom. The air quality in the room not too good, the windows don`t open, the swimming pool (free) is adequate, and the fact that the fitness area costs 115 pesos to use for hotel guests ridiculous. Other little annoyances (sorry, but with this quality of hotel I need to mention them): no complementary water in the room, the minibar being locked after cleaning (after explicity having had someone come up to open it the night before). Overall a good hotel, but definitely not great in my book.

<Content>Would definitely consider returning I ended up here after getting stuck without a hotel room at the Fiesta Americana and calling all around and finding NOTHING else in Mexico City. I never would have thought to book this hotel, because I鈥檓 really not into huge, high rise chain hotels, but I would definitely stay here again. Location: Not bad, it was surprisingly fast to get around from this hotel. Maybe I was just lucky, but the traffic wasn鈥檛 too bad when I had to get out and around. Service: Excellent. Room: I have no idea what type of room I ended up in (1515, I would ask for something like this if I end up booking this hotel again), but it was massive, really comfortable for working, which is what I usually end up doing all day long when I鈥檓 in Mexico City. There was a large desk, large enough for two people to work comfortably. The bathroom was huge as well. Really a comfortable room. Food: Not bad. Not a huge variety, but it was okay. Spa: Didn鈥檛 use it, but there is one. Gym: Didn鈥檛 use it, but there is one, and it looks like a great one.

<Content>Great location, excellent service Enjoyed my stay at this Sheraton which is an excellent business hotel. It has a great location right opposite a wonderfu park, a beautifullobby and the rooms are very well appointed with everything you need for a comfortable stay. The restaurants in the hotel are first class, and you can enjoy a very good buffet lunch in the first floor restaurant. The hotel has a fantastic health club called Sport City - this is the best gym I have ever used at a hotel - a huge free weights area, all the latest machines, many bikes and treadmills, and even exercise classes if you wanted them. There is no charge for this facility. The service at the hotel is friendly and the staff should be congratulated. There is also a small shopping mall right next to the hotel with a few good fast food type outlets and a Starbucks, or you can visit some of the impromptu market trader stalls where you can buy everything from cheap (illegal?) dvds and cds to sunglasses, and food.

<Content>Decent Sheraton Booked this hotel via Hotelclub.com. Paid 100 USD per night, which was very reasonable.Located in walking distance to the historical centre....a short 10 minute walk to the Zucalo. The hotel is pretty new, and the public areas are airly and stylish, which a lot of things going on. There are many restaurants, lounges and bars in the lobby.The room was large and modern. The bed were very comfortable. TV with many channels. Coffee and tea making facilities. The bathroom was large with a large bathtub. Seperate room for the toilet and bidet. There were wifi too, but at a charge.The service was fine. Greeted by doormen and front desk staff. Security also good at the entrance, by the elevators and around in the lobby.

<Content>Really Nice Hello everyone,I stayed at the Sheraton while on business in Mexico City. My rate was $180 US per night. I have never been to Mexico City before, and the hotel my co-workers were staying in was full. My travel agent recommended this hotel as it was centrally located. Check in was very timely and my room was awesome. I have stayed in the good and bad and this was one of the nicest rooms that I've stayed in for a while. The health club was excellent, however there was an extra change for this. I ate breakfast and lunch at the hotel and both were top notch and reasonable. The area around the hotel is a bit rough (as is most of Mexico City), however there is a nice indoor shopping area a block away, a Starbucks in the same facility and a 7-11 convenience store close by for incidentals. Taxi from airport was around $12.00. Will stay there again. Thanks for reading!

<Content>Contemporary, central and comfortable! Very attractive and very comfortable hotel facing Alameda park. Great rooms (particularly those higher up with views) and slick lobby/bar. Well reviewed restaurant which we didn't try - terrace breakast dining was lovely though. Location is just 2 blocks from the Belles Artes, 6 from the Zocalo and generally in the middle of town. As Starwood members we received a $150 per night upgraded room on 24th floor on the weekend. Checkout was a hassle because clerks ignored the red carpet Starwood line until a local businessman called the duty manager on his cellphone.

<Content>great accomodations, friendly staff Stayed for 3 nights. Very modern hotel w/very spacious rooms. Nice marble bathrooms. Excellent food in their restaurants. Personable, helpful staff. Nice location across from world famous park. Near Diego Rivera Museum and Bella Artes Museum. Take the double decker tour bus from the stop 1 block down to get an overview of the City ($11 per adult).

<Content>We loved this Sheraton, in the Centro Historico We had one day and one night to spend in Mexico City after a conference in Puebla, and chose this hotel because of its location in the historical center. Our choice couldn't have been better.Service was impeccable, from bellboy to concierge, and our room was huge, with a view of the Alameda. The marble bathroom was as nice as any we've had anywhere in the world.Yes the area is a little rough around the edges, but the concierge told us as long as there were people about, it was completely safe. At around 9:00 pm, we walked to Chinatown, and then to the Zocalo, without problem or concern.We'd return to this beautiful, immaculate, comfortable hotel in a heartbeat.

<Content>Wonderful Stay! What a pleasure! We stayed 2 nights at the hotel and couldn't have asked for more! The hotel, the staff, and the rooms exceeded standard Sheratons that I've stayed at in the past. The one negative (if you want to call it that) is the bed ... most of the Sheraton properties I've stayed at have upgraded to the Sweet Sleeper beds, unfortunately, this one has not - the beds were still comfortable, just not quite at the level of other Sheratons. BUT what a night view...the city was so pretty at night.I ate at both Don Don Don and El Cardenal and the food and service were delicious at both. Unfortunately, I never got to visit the Spa, but I am sure it would have been great.

<Content>Great location; excellent service I accompanied my husband who attended a convention at the Sheraton. While I was worried about getting around by myself, the concierge did a fantastic job of setting up tours and letting me know where it was safe to walk and visit . The Zocolo, markets, and museums were an easy walk away. Although I didn't try the Metro, the Hop on Hop off  tour bus stopped a block away and was a very easy way to get to the museums, markets, and other parts of the city. The hotel was safe, the rooms delightful, and the staff courteous. Can't say enough good things about their concierge staff. View from the room was wonderful. Room service had the best chicken soup I've tasted in years. Also liked having the food court and Starbucks next door.

<Content>Nice Hotel but location is questionable We stayed at the Sheraton Centro Historico Hotel for 5 nights at the end of August 2007. We were travelling with another family and had rooms next to each other on the 24th floor. The hotel is primarily a business hotel because during the week the hotel is very busy with the majority of the guests there to attend conventions but during the weekends, the hotel is much quieter. The hotel is new and modern with all the services you would expect from a upper end hotel- including an onsite spa, bank in the lobby, concierge, security, etc... The rooms were very comfortable and roomy. My wife and I shared a room with my 2 teenage daughters and even with the 2 double beds, we still had lots of room. The floor to ceiling windows make the room seem even larger and the air conditioning unit was very efficient. The hotel employees were very efficient and friendly. Most of the employees we dealt with spoke English. Hotel swimming pool was closed for repairs the entire time we stayed at the hotel. The hotel is located less than a 5 minutes walk away from 2 subway stop (Juarez and Hildago) and this makes exploring the city very easy and cheap. The Zocalo is 2 subways stops away (or a 30 minute walk) and the Zona Rosa can be easily reached by the buses that run along Reforma (or walked in 30-40 minutes). This is my 3rd visit to Mexico City (previously staying at the Hotel Cathedral and Hotel Nikko) and I really enjoyed the location and service of the Sheraton. There is a Starbucks next door to the Hotel in the mall (the food court is actually quite good). However, the location is not the safest - especially late at night/early morning - when there are not many people about. On the last day of our visit, one of our travel companions was in the Alameda Park, across the street from the hotel, when he was approached and asked for his digital camera and back pack by a young man. The robber did not show a weapon, and my companion just pushed him away and during this struggle, the police in front of the hotel noticed and started to chase the robber. I've alway wondered why there are sometimes up to 20 police officers in front of the hotel, and now I know why. This all happened at 3:30 in the afternoon.

<Content>Avoid this Hotel!!!!! Unfortunately my friend and I had a horrible, demorilizing experience at this particular Sheraton. We knew we were only staying for one evening, since we were on our way to another city in Mexico, and we wanted to treat ourselves. We were interested in the pool, whirlpool, and spa.Once we got there we asked about the pool and were told it was out of service due to maintanence, as well as the whirlpool. We then asked about the spa and were told it had closed at 5pm, but would be open at 8am the next day. We had planned to leave in the morning but decided we wanted massages first.This is where the plot thickens, we went to breakfast the next morning on the seconf floor restaurant. We were refused entrance!! The man at the front desk told us that we had to be in formal shoes, and not to have on open toed shoes. We were flabbergasted. My friend told him that we were wearing flip flops (or summer shoes) because we had appointments in the spa afterwards. He still refused to let us in. I then asked to speak to the manager. The manager kept in step with the employee and said that our shoes were not appropriate. We again told him that we were going to the spa right after. He finally let us enter!I'm a black woman, and my friend is a Cambodian American woman. As we sat down to eat we noticed that most of the patrons were Europeans and many had on shorts, and t-shirts. We started looking at their shoes. Almost all the people were in sandals or flip flops( the same as us!). We asked one of the men if he was hasseled on the way in, he looked at us as if we were crazy and started laughing. He said no. More women came in that had on the same shoes as us and nothing was happening to them at the front desk. We were getting so upset. I asked to speak to the manager again. He just made excuses and said he couldn't do anything to people that were already in the restaurant. I asked for his name because my friend and I were going to report this to the main desk in the lobby.I was not going to pay for the breakfast, but I still had to sign the bill in the restaturant. Once we went to the lobby and explained to the manager , Vicotor Dorantes, he simply took the side of the restaurant. I couldn't believe it. It was so clear and blatant that we were picked out and almost refused service! I've never been treated this way in my life. I was so upset that I was crying and I kept telling him that we were not treated properly and that many of the patrons had the same shoes as us. I also told him that we were leaving in a few hours and I was not going to pay for the meal. I told him that the customers should be right, not the manager from the restaurant. He finally reimbursed our meal.My friend and I clearly thought that if we were European, or Anglo Americans, none of this would have happened. I've never encountered this level of racism, especially at a Sheraton!!Please avoid this Hotel.

<Content>Good hotel, nice location and great price! I agree with the previous review. The rooms were spacious and clean and service was prompt and professional. Our rooms on the 24th floor had fantastic views of the city. We found an online deal for about US$80+tax/for a room with two beds. We stayed there August 8-14, 2007.Everyone at the reception and concierge spoke excellent English - and every employee made a good effort to communicate with us. The hotel is in a great location for seeing all the downtown/Zocalo sights - I agree, walk, don't cab to the Zocalo.I had a fantastic hot-stone massage at the spa and would highly recommend it (note: the workers in the gym/spa spoke limited or no English). The gym and steam room are great too - check if usage is included in your reservation (you may need a Starwood membership); there's a 115 peso charge (check rates in advance, I might be wrong on the exact price) for a day's use.Breakfast in the restaurant at the lobby was very nice but over priced compared to local places - and it was always packed so you'll need reservations (they'll offer coffee and pastries while you wait). The coffee was mediocre, food ok. Their hot chocolate however is in a league of its own with special spices! My friend had an omelette with ant eggs and raved about it. Compared to other food I ate in the city, my squash blossom omelette with green chile was rather bland - surprising in a country with so many strong and tasty flavors. It's clearly 'a place to be seen' in Mexico City. Avoid the second floor restaurant of the Sheraton (Los Dones?) which is open from 7-11; it's a tourist trap and over priced (international cuisine) - but if like us you're tired and just want a quick meal, it's convenient - and service was impeccable.Try the food court next door for a quick bite (they have a Starbucks if you want something familiar, although personally I like to go-local for a cheaper and more typical coffee). There's also an HCSB branch and ATM there.A secure taxi to the hotel from the airport costs 127 pesos (around US$12), however, a taxi from the hotel to the airport costs 240 pesos. Since it's not advisable to order a cab from the street, you basically have no other option. Taking taxis from the hotel is expensive but you never have to wait for one, and they guarantee you're safe. (This is typical to all hotels in the city). Don't be affraid to take the metro/subway - it may seem overwhelming at first, but it's dirt cheap, very fast and safe (watch out for pick pocketers). Do not however use it after dark - while the subway is safe, the streets may not be, especially if you're out on your own in the dark - use it only during day light hours. (Most museums and sights close around 5-6pm.)We couldn't try the pool as it was closed.General comment: If you're a smoker you'll love Mexico City. If not, check in advance for outdoor or non-smoking sections when making restaurant reservations.

<Content>Very nice My wife and i stayed here from July 12 through the 16th.It is a very modern hotel, and we chose to stay here since we are starwood members.The rooms are big and confortable. Bathrooms are decent size, but toilet area feels cramped and not well ventilated.We were located on the 24th floor, and we had a beautiful view, although not of Alameda Park and Bellas Artes.It is a 15 minute walk to the Zocalo, and believe me, sometimes it was faster than getting a cab at rush hour. You can take a nice stroll and see all the nice things in the histric center.I would recommend this hotel to other travelers, just eat somewhere else where the food is cheaper.

<Content>Rude Staff Very rude manager and desk staff. Much of the misunderstanding between myself and the staff was due to the poor English of the reservations agent. This is unlike my experience at other Sheraton Hotels. Once the mistake was uncovered the management was not willing to change the charges. It was clear that greed reigns over customer satisfaction/loyalty. I would not recommend an English speaker attempt to make a reservation at this hotel.

<Content>Nice modern hotel in a safe convenient location We stayed at Sheraton Cetro over the weekend. We got a very rate from Expedia. The room is big, very clean and quiet. There are shops around the hotel and close to the Juarrez and Hidalgo metro stations. It is about 15 minutes walk from Zocalo. We feel fairly safe walking around the hotel. The hotel restaurants are good and reasonably priced. The concierge english is good but seem reluctant to give bus and metro information. I got the impression they expect their guests to take taxi all the time. We asked to check out at 2:00 instead of 1:00PM, and they immediately agreed without any hesitation or charges. Overall a very good hotel.

<Content>Very nice hotel We stayed at the Sheraton Centro Historico for two nights on a tour. The rooms were very nice and spacious, the dining area was pleasant and had excellent food, with a wide choice of Mexican and American dishes, fruit, cereals, and eggs cooked to order for breakfast. The meeting room where we meet for a tour briefing was ugly, but we were only there for an hour. The hotel is located right across from a very nice park, and just down the street from the Palacio de Bellas Artes. It takes perhaps 20 minutes to walk to the Plaza Mayor, with the National Palace ( Diego Rivera murals), cathedral, and the Templo Mayor Aztec ruins and museum. Internet access was so expensive that we didn't use it. There are numerous very good restaurants nearby, and there is also a nearby metro stop.

<Content>great room, ok location The room was very clean and modern looking. It's a bit of walk from Zocalo so if you are planning to visit the main tourist part of the city, the location is not desirable. The staff was friendly but the service was inconsistent. When we asked about the nearest subway station to the bus terminal, he said there is none and we should take the tourist taxi. We later found there was a station right next to the terminal, so that was disappointing. One positive experience was when we asked for early check in at 8AM they waived the fee.

<Content>great room, too bad about the dinner We had a good stay at the Sheraton. We were upgraded to a better room which was magnificent - if anything, a little too big!Our only real gripe was dinner. If you arrive on an international flight and stay in a big business hotel from a leading chain, you should be able to expect to be decently fed. But the Mexican restaurant on the ground floor (which is not owned by the Sheraton as it happens) closes on most days at 6pm. That left only the hotel's restaurant, which was rather poor - not at all what I would expect in this class of hotel.

<Content>Very good Mexico City Hotel! My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton for 3 nights while touring Mexico City. The hotel is very centrally located near a number of cultural attractions such as the Zocalo, Belles Artes, the governors residence, and the Templo Mayor. We got a very good deal on the hotel through it's website which included an excellent buffet breakfast.Since the Sheraton is primarily a business hotel, the hotel has a somewhat sterile feel to it and is more functional than charming. That being said, we were given a very large corner room with a beautiful view of the dome of Belles Artes. The rooms are very simple, but nicely appointed with comfortable beds and nice ammenities. The only glitch was a bad hair dryer which believe it or not took 2 days to have replaced!! One important lesson learned...if you have a problem don't contact the front desk staff; you must speak directly with the hotel manager. After asking the front staff 3 times to have it fixed, and it wasn't, we finally spoke with the manager who had it fixed in 5 mins.The buffet breakfast was probably the best we'd had in Mexico. Fresh squeezed juices (including Orange, Grapefruit, Papaya and Carrot), Freshly prepared enchiladas, salsas, omelletes, etc. We just ate breakfast and dinner!While the location can't be beat for cultural attractions, dining options within walking distance are very limited. Any good restaurant is a definite cab ride.....which brings up another point. Every guide book recommends not taking certain taxis (Green VWs) in Mexico City. The hotel further recommends you not use any public taxis and rely on their car service. These are pretty expensive ($10-$15 for a 10-15 min. ride)! Use your best judgement....we actually took the subway everywhere since it is both cheap and safe!Overall, we would recommend the hotel since it's location and proximity to cultural attractions, and ammenities are very good.

<Content>Great Hotel If you want to stay at a Sheraton in Mexico City, this is the one for you. It is streets ahead of the other Sheraton (Maria Isabel) in every department. It's newer, cleaner, has much better rooms, better service and is usually cheaper.This is a top quality hotel at reasonable rates with excellent rooms and it has a great wine bar. The only problem for Sheraton is that it makes the Maria Isabel look so poor!

<Content>Nice Hotel, Lovely City I loved this hotel, the food and service were delicious. The surrounding area can be positive and negative, depending on how you look at it. It is in the historic part of the city, with beautiful buildings but it can be pretty smelly due to bad sewage.The city has a lot to offer, with many different things to visit. I would love to go back and definitely would stay at this hotel.

<Content>Plain bad service We reserved more than a dozen of rooms in August and negotiated a specific rate. It was bad since the reservation process all the way to the service. The staff was always nice but never did anything to solve the many problems they created. Indiferent and not organized at all. Lots of our guests changed to the hotel next door the Fiesta Inn and they found out that they had a lot better prices and they were very good. The building is very beautiful, the restaurants are not bad, the location is great even with the tents of the PRD political demostrators, but it is to expensive for what they offer and we will probably avoid the Sheraton Hotels in the organizing of our next events.

<Content>Top Hotel in top location! This hotel is really excellent and in the best location of Mexico City, right at a nice park and just a few minutes walk into the historic center and the Zocalo. Rooms: Very big, stylish and clean. Breathtaking view of the city from the rooms, especially if you stay at one of the top floors.Food: Breakfast ist excellent. The food in the restaurant is very good too.Service: Very good!Location: Top! You can easily walk to the Zocalo/historic center- it is a nice and safe area. Just next door you have a small shopping mall with some shops and Mc Donalds, Starbucks, etc. .... The hopon-hopoff sightseeing bus, which is one of the best ways to get to know this city (because of the big distances between the sights) stops right outside the hotel.

<Content>Excellent hotel My daughter and I stayed at the Sheraton Centro and found it to be a wonderful experience, except for the Concierge . We asked for information on the bus schedule to Oaxaca twice and he never got back to us. We got information from the Tourist kiosk, and we were directed to the Metro system, which couldn't have been cheaper (20 centavos), or more efficient for getting anywhere in the City. Check it out.We had both breakfast and dinner at the hotel and spent about $50, as opposed to the Maria Isabel, where we spent our last night before departing for the U.S., and a shrimp cocktail was $22, coffee and water in the room, an extra charge. Is that due to the proximity of the American Embassy?I definitely would reccommend the SheratonCentro.

<Content>Luxury The Sheraton was everything you'd expect from a top hotel. Our room had a view over the city, which was nice. The room was extremely comfortable with all the mod cons. The location is exactly where you want to be if spending a couple of days in Mexico City. The Centro Historico is where most of the tourist sights are, and the park across the road is very pretty.

<Content>ask for view of the park Because of reviwers on this site, we knew to ask for a view of the park. I wrote ahead, and of course was given no guarantee, but received a cordial reply. The day we arrived, about a half hour before check-in time, the hotel's computer system had been out for several hours and all staff at the registration desk were trying their best to be efficient and professional, but it must have been a nightmare for them. We were taken to a room, only to find it occupied and that another party was also being taken to the same room. The bell hop called the desk and then was told to take us to a different room. We refused to go to that room because it was on the other side of the hotel, without a view of the park. We were told that there were no more rooms with a park view available. Then the mgr asked if we could wait a little while, so they could sort things out and come back. We went to the dining room for a $30 each lunch buffet(ouch)and came back in an hour and a half. They still had not found us a room in our prepaid price category facing the park, so they offered us an upgrade of a corner king room or a 2 queen bed higher up. My husband chose the corner king which was absolutely gorgeous! Knee to ceiling windows on an angled corner covered one entire wall with very sophisticated decor and furnishings, beautiful art work and lighting and a luxurious bathroom. The hotel's location was great, close to the subway, the Palacio de Bellas Artes, and Sanborn's House of Tiles, and within walking distance to the Zocalo. We went to a Mozart Concert where our own St. Louis Symphony musician was a guest solo violinist at that concert. Serendipitous! Not only did we get to look at the beautiful Tiffany glass curtain during the whole concert, but we got to go backstage afterward to be greeted warmly by the soloist. It was my husband's first time in Mexico City and I felt nervous (Would he like it?)So, I felt fine when, afterward, he said that we stayed in the perfect place for our purpose.

<Content>All you could want... Upon check-in I was put in a room near the elevator. When I asked to be moved, I was upgraded to a very nice corner room and offered an apology for my trouble. Hotel is great value for the money -- modern, clean, friendly staff, free in-room internet (all you could want or desire).

<Content>Absolutely fine, book in advance for famous lobby restaurant We just had a very nice stay at the Sheraton when I went with my husband on a business trip to Mexico City. We didn't know what to expect but it was clean, modern and located very close to downtown. The restaurant in the lobby, El Cardenal, is one of the famous old places in Mexico City which and has now relocated to the Sheraton. It's hard to get a table and their breakfasts are very popular so I would book at least a week before you go down to Mexico City. The business center is great (tho more expensive than an internet cafe, of course) and there is internet in the room if you have a laptop and cable.

<Content>Nice Place This was my first tme to Mexico City and I was amazed at how progressive this hotel was. If you are having a business conference it is ideal. For the tourist - the only thing that it lacks is a pool.
