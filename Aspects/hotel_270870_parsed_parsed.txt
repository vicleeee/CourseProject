<Content>Warm and Friendly We just returned from a 2.5 week trip throught Europe, with Paris being on of our stops. While in Paris we stayed at the Hotel Valadon for 4 nights. We could not have been more satisfied with out stay. Here are the pro's and con's of our stay:Pro's: Hospitality: Victor, Maria, Chrystal (I hope I spelled that right!), even housekeeping, were all friendly and warm. Paris was a rough and rather rude city (especially my 100% American husband!), so it was nice to know that you would at least wake up to breakfast served with a smile. The rooms are very clean, the bed and comforter are very comfortable, and the heater in the room was a HUGE plus!Breakfast: Victor's jams are one of the yummiest things I have ever tasted in my 26 years. We tried as many flavors as we could and all were great! We bought a strawberry and 2 Mirabelle to take home. Breakfast would not have been the same without Othello! He is such a sweet dog. He'll sit by you the entire time you eat (of course with hopes you'll share!), staring at you with puppy eyes. FYI: if you sneak him a little peice, he'll pat you're leg to ask you for more! Sorry Maria!!!location: right in the heart of Rue Cler. We ate from the markets everyday. They have a delicious plethora of fresh and delicious food without breaking your bank. The metro is about a 4 minute walk to Ecole Militare stop. The Eifel Tower is about 10 minutes away, as is the Rodin museum. Con's: Honestly, I have nothing bad to say about this hotel, but as an American, I can see how some fellow Americans may perceive this place. The rooms are small, as are the showers and bathroom. The beds are not the huge, Seilly Posterpedic bed we are acustomed to. Yes, the tv only has 2 channels, and yes, they are CNN. HOWEVER, we stayed at 6 other hotels in Europe and ALL OF THEM only have CNN in english!!! Whatever. try watching Dora the Explorer in french; you might learn something! There isn't much nightlife in this area of the city, but the metro is so conviently located that you can just jump on it to get to such an area.I can not wait to return to Paris and I will definetly return to the Hotel Valadon on our next trip!

<Content>Quiet, convenient, clean! Spent 4 nights and 3 days at this hotel. 10-minute walk to the Eiffel Tower, 10-minutes from Napoleon's Tomb, one block away from the wonderful Rue Cler walking street. Bakeries, restaurants, fresh produce shops, and more within 5 minutes. We stayed in a family room which accommodated 3 persons, large spacious bathroom, immaculate facility, Victor's jams and jellies at breakfast are superb. Safe area too. Victor and Orseinne were fabulous hosts and answered all our questions. Highly recommend the Segway tours that start at the Eiffel Tower! We had a blast! I would go back to Hotel Valadon for sure!

<Content>Freindly  If you are looking for a 5 star hotel....don't stay here. However, if you want a true sense of Paris; by all means choose the Valadon. The rooms are smallish compared to major hotel chains, but we spent hardly any time there. Too much to see  do! The owners got us on our way everyday with written instructions on navigation of the Metro  RER and provided maps. They even booked our cab to the airport. The breakfast was delicious and unrushed and we enjoyed Othello, what a sweet Harrier. Eileen, Scottsdale, AZ

<Content>Absolutely wonderful stay From the moment you walk into the Hotel Valadon you feel you are home. Guests are greated warmly each day and treated like treasured friends. Victor and Maria have a warm personality that instantly put my sister, niece, and I at ease in a strange city. Maria helped us daily to figure out our train schedule and how best to see the sights. The breakfast was wonderful, Victor's jams are beyond compare. The room was spotless and comfortable.My twin and I along with my niece decided to celebrate our major birthday in Paris; we had never been to Europe. Victor, Maria and the staff (also dog Othello) helped to make our trip one we will always remember.Arlene

<Content>Valadon a great value and location! My husband son and I just got back from a week's stay at the Valadon and were overall very pleased. We stayed in the Family cottage which has a double bed and a twin. Though the room was not fancy it was very clean and looked just like the picture on the web. The bathroom was down a small staircase in the basement. Pluses were that it was quite large, but it was rather dark and the toilet stall smelled a bit moldy. The owners, Victor and Maria, were very helpful and professional, strking the right balance between friendly, but not too friendly. Based on a couple of other reviews I had read I was concerned that they would be looking to have political discussions to air anti-American views, but this was not at all the case. The breakfast consisting of fresh croissants and breads and Victor's homemade preserves was very tasty and filling. Their beagle hangs out in the breakfast room during breakfast, but is very well mannered. The best thing about the hotel is the great location, only a block from Rue Cler and only 5-7 minutes walk from the La Tour Maubourg or Ecole Militaire metro stops and an easy walk to the Eiffel Tower and Les Invalides. I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to others as a great value!

<Content>Our stay at the Valadon We more than enjoyed our stay at the Valadon. We were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary and Maria made it all the more special for us. We had a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower, which is awesome especially at night when it is lighted. Since this is a very small hotel, what you lack in facilities is more than made up by the personal service. The location is super, close to restaurants and shops and a short walk to the bus stop. The weather could have been better but since it was November, there were no waiting lines at any of the attractions. Our room was very simple but clean and comfortable. We certainly would stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel - Great Location !! I stayed with my son and a friend during July 08 at this fantastic hotel. Situated only a short walk to the nearest underground and in a lovely part of Paris. We had the family room which is situated at the back. The room itself was comfortable furnished with really comfy beds and pillows. The bathroom was in the basement and was clean and modern.Breakfast was good with plenty of coffee refills which I needed ! Maria was very friendly and helpful and I'm sure to return to this hotel again. The price is good value for money especially by Paris standards and I have no hesitation recommending this hotel to anyone who's looking for a great hotel.

<Content>Great value We stayed for four nights in early October. We loved our stay here. Location is excellent. Very close to the Eiffel Tower. And also a walk to the Champs-脡lys茅es. The services was excellent. Victor and Maria were lovely. But the more lovely was Orthello. It was so nice to have a dog at breakfast when I was missing my dog at home.The rooms were comfortable. The bathroom and shower were very small, but for the price you pay, it's a small sacrifice.

<Content>JUST DO IT Great choice for a very expensive city. We stayed for four nights late Oct 2008 and Valadon was more than what we expected. Clean, spacious, kind hosts, centrally located, great hand made jam by Mr Victor, sweet puppy Othelo welcomes you. We would definetely go there again and believe me we are not the easiest people on earth!

<Content>Great find in Paris The Hotel Valadon is a charming little hotel in a village like atmosphere in the centre of Paris. The staff at the hotel are welcoming and for a non French speaker like me it was great to be able converse in English.The room my Mam and I had was a triple out the back of hte hotel with a little private terrace. The bed was comfy and the place was spotless. The bathroom was a dramatic, stylish basement bathroom with lovely fittings. The only problem was the very steep stairs with no handrail - definitely wouldn't want to have had a few drinks heading down - a hand rail would have been great.The breakfast was lovely and fresh every morning and becasue the hotel is so small and intimate you tend to chat to the other guests and get some good tips.Around the corner is Rue Cler which is an old style Parisian viallage type street with the buthcer the baker and probably the candle stick maker. We ate at the CAfe Marche, had lovely entrecote steak with a home made bernaise sauce and trimmings - for 13 euro. they also make great mojitos and the staff were very friendly.Parisians seem to be getting friendlier - there is more willingness to help tourists and english is spoken by most young people who learn it in school.I for one will be back and I will be staying in Hotel Valadon.

<Content>Excellent experience We stayed in the Family Cottage for three nights. I cannot fault this small and friendly hotel. The owners were extremely helpful and gave excellent advice.The location is ideal, surrounded by restaurants and bistros, but the road outside is very quiet.The rooms are not huge, but they are clean and well furnished. Bathrooms were clean and smartly decorated. We will stay here again.

<Content>What a Great Find ! Took my mother to Paris as a 60th Birthday surprise. After the great reviews on this site, we booked 4 rooms directly with the hotel. The rooms were small, but big enough for 2 people and comfortable and well decorated. They have a family cottage on site which offers self contained accomodation . We couldn't believe how quiet this hotel was given its' location 5-10mins walk from the Eiffel Tower. Great pedestrian shopping area with cheese shops, cafes and restaurants in the parallel road. 2 minutes from the nearest metro station, which is only 1 change from Gare du Nord. Marie  Victor recommended and booked a fantastic local restaurant for us - also within walking distance. Victor's jams are delicious - unfortunately cabin baggage only meant we couldn't bring any home!We will definitely return.

<Content>Sweet Hotel Hotel Valadon was a small and quiet hotel. We went on our honeymoon and enjoyed our breakfast. The homemade jams are amazing and they were extremely helpful in helping us get around. The location was great we saw the eifel tower every night since it was a short walk away. We were able to get evrywhere from this hotel we had trains, buses and metro nearby. Othello their dog was very welcoming as well.

<Content>Great Little Hotel! It was everything a small, family run hotel should be! We easily made the reservation at the hotel web site. We arrived and were promptly greeted, given maps of the City, and checked in. The owners of the hotel were so sweet and helpful.Rooms had everything you need and are slightly larger than normal Paris hotel rooms. We had a lovely French breakfast each morning with Othello - the sweet dog that rules over the dining room.The location is great and hotel is located on a REALLY quiet street, which is nice given that you are in Paris (land of the loud diesel engine). We could walk over to the Eiffel Tower at night after having dinner at a one of the many great restaurants in the neighborhood. The metro is just a few blocks away but you can walk to main attractions like the Louvre or the D'Orsay.

<Content>Lives up to it's Reputation! Just returned from 4 days at Valadon and enjoyed every minute. Quiet location but Rue Cler just round the corner and plenty cafes, bars etc in Rue Grenelle and Rue St Dominique. Recommend both Cafe Rousillon and Cafe Central on Rue Cler for good value evening meals. 5 mins to Eiffel Tower and Invalides, 2 metro stations couple of minutes away.Victor and Maria are great hosts and can't say much more about Othello that hasn't been said already. We had triple room which had ample space and all you require bar tea/coffee facilities. Breakfast was light but very tasty and for 155 Euro per night with Breakfast, it is great value.Hope to be back

<Content>The Hotel Valadon is a little gem! We spent 3 nights at the Hotel Valadon in early October. This hotel is a little gem---rooms are compact but very stylish, with high-quality fabrics used in the draperies. Ample light and ventilation is provided by two large windows. Bathrooms are small but well-designed. Victor and Maria are delightful hosts, and it was a treat to be around their dog Othello in the breakfast room. I am remembering Victor's wonderful black currant jam, and wish I had brought a jar back home with me.I think the hotel is an excellent value and would definitely stay there again. The location, with proximity to the Rue Cler and Metro and bus stops, is unbeatable.

<Content>Value at the Valadon...and more Whether this is your maiden trip to Paris or a return visit to this magical city, look no further than the Hotel Valadon in the picturesque Rue Cler district as your preferred hotel. Not only is the Valadon an incredible value, the hotel offers an experience that is unmatched in its attention to detail and warm hospitality. My initial booking enquiry via email resulted in a prompt, considerate response. Upon arrival at this little jewel in the heart of one of the prettiest parts of Paris, the experience just got better. We were graciosly ushered into a bright, spacious room complete with free wifi and a modern, well-equipped bathroom. The scrumptuous breakfast, hosted by Othello the hotel hound, featured fresh croissants and three of your host's delectable homemade jams. If you are perusing all of the reviews regarding Paris hotels and wondering where to stay just stop, contact the Hotel Valadon, and hope they have a room for you. You will not be disappointed.

<Content>Great little hotel This is a great small hotel in an ideal location, within walking distance of all the major tourist attractions, and also right next door to Rue Cler, a 3-4 block street with cheese, pastry and fresh fruit markets, as well as several restaurants. The owners are most hospitable, and were helpful in providing directions and sightseeing tips. The rooms are small (it is Paris, after all), but very contemporary in decor, and equipped with everything that a typical vacation traveler would need. The best restaurant that we found in the neighborhood was Bistrot La Petite Troquet , on Rue d'Exposition, just a few blocks from the hotel, but there are many others within walking distance as well. This was an ideal hotel for us as first time visitors to Paris, and we highly recommend it.

<Content>Cute little place! We stayed at the Hotel Valadon for two nights at the end of August, largely because of its reviews on Trip Advisor. We found the hotel to be cute and cozy and appreciated the small size. We also liked the honor bar and the fridge to store your own purchases, though I agree with others that an area to make your own tea and/or coffee would be a nice touch. The rooms and bathrooms are small, but serviceable. Really, the only negative is that there is a lot of street noise at night. As we were there when Paris was experiencing 70+ degree weather, we kept our windows open all day and all night and had some trouble sleeping due to all the noise at night (mostly dump trucks emptying trash at the surrounding restaurants).All in all, we had a great stay, the hotel is in a great location and we would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Hidden Gem The Hotel Valadon is in a pretty good location right off the metro. The staff is great and very accomodating with tips and suggestions for getting around town. I did like the breakfast in the morning and the reasonably priced internet service. Wifi is free if you bring your own laptop. The rooms are comforable and the bathroom is very modern. We stayed for one night and we would definitely come back. Great place... you won't regret booking here.

<Content>We loved Hotel Valadon Four of us stayed at Hotel Valadon the first week of September. The location is excellent, close to good places to eat and good places to buy all the food stuffs that Paris is noted for... The rooms and bedding are clean, the beds are comfortable and access is easy. Maria and Victor are very nice people and were very helpful in setting up tours, calling for taxi, and suggesting venues and timing. One of us was 82 and the elevator was very much appreciated. A PC is available for internet, a refrigerator is available for personal beverage and food items, along with plates, glasses, etc. Bottles of a very nice red wine is available for 5 Euros (on the honor system) . The breakfast and homemade jams was always nicely done and coffee with steamed milk on the side was very good. And, we met very nice people who were also staying at Hotel Valadon. I will certainly return to Hotel Valadon and I highly recommend the hotel. Bill Mahan

<Content>Well placed hotel Booked this hotel because of reviews in Trip Advisor. It is very well placed for central Paris - 10 minutes walk to Eiffel Tower, Pont d'Alma. Well served by buses and a metro station less than 5 minutes walk away. Plenty of eating places with varied prices all around. Small supermarket and patisserie literally a minute from hotelOn a quiet, narrow street, the hotel is small but quiet. We had a room with double and single bed and it was a reasonable size. Shower area was small though and door didn't fit so the floor got wet!I liked that wine and soft drinks were available with honesty payments and a fridge to store your own purchases but felt it was a lack that there was no coffee or tea-making facilities either in room or in area where could have lunch. It was good to have that area, but there wasn't anywhere really comfortable to sit either in eating area or your room. The TV was really high up and awkward to see.

<Content>Fantastic value We were wary of a deal like this in Paris but went with the TripAdvisor recommendation and were extremely pleased.Great directions from Victor and Marie via email. The Ecole Militare Metro stop is about a 5 minute walk and the neighborhood is terrific. 5 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower, 25 to Musee d' Orsay.NOT an American style hotel but perfect for anyone wanting a taste of Paris. VERY clean and VERY accommodating. Compared to the staff at the other hotels we stayed at in France--well, there is no comparison. These guys are great.Thanks Victor and Marie--who by the way speak excellent English

<Content>Had to cancel, but... Due to my wife's back surgery and recovery complications, we had to cancel our upcoming stay in November 2008. I wrote to Victor and Maria to explain our situation. I was somewhat surprised by the kind and prompt reply they sent me, in about 15 minutes. I was only somewhat surprised though, due to all the good and positive things I read about them on TA.I have never met Victor or Maria. However, given their great communication and kindness to someone they have never met, I cannot wait for the opportunity to be their guest in the future.Thanks you, Maria... and thank you, Victor....! What kind and nice people indeed....! Regardless of any deal or offer from any other hotel, Hotel Valadon is now my home in Paris....

<Content>I Agree! I actually agree with everything that has been said previously, but that includes the review advising people not to take the courtyard room. My wife and I had this room (Room 01) for 5 nights and it is half below ground and has a skylight window which the room above can see into. Not very pleasant.But apart from that, the Valadon is excellent. Maria and Victor are charming hosts and the location of the hotel is excellent. I recommend the Valadon very highly, but ask for any room other than number 01.

<Content>Favourite on Round the World Trip My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights at the end of July 08, and it was by far the best on our Round the World trip. Victor and Maria were amazing, so friendly and helpful, the breakfast was awesome, we even woke late from a night at Moulin Rouge and Maria was still accomodating with Breakfast. We will definately return to Paris - such a wonderful City, and with DEFINATELY stay here again, best location.
