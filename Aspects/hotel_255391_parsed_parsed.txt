<Content>Overrated and shabby. The price of a room here is as much as a decent hotel room in a nice part of the city. The king room booked and paid for was not available - was downgraded to two single beds but had to insist on a part-refund. The hotel is a dump - old, tired and shabby and does not warrant the many stars (nor $ value) attached to its name. Very expensive breakfast - cheaper to hold off and eat at the airport. The only consolation is it was clean.

<Content>OK for a single night I stayed here for one night in June 2008. Main reason was close proximity to the airport.I found staff friendly and helpful. Room was bit small but OK for a single night.Shuttle to the airport is A$5 and from the airport is free. It runs about every 30 mins.If you are after cheap internet access, take your laptop to the lobby and ask for a wireless internet voucher (A$5 for 30 mins).

<Content>Worst Airport Hotel Imaginable Well, here's the litany of problems we encountered on our one night stay at this airport hotel.鈥?Telephoned hotel from airport for shuttle, phone rang 15 times and disconnected. TWICE!鈥?Went to room, connected to internet broadband system ($27.50/ day, highest charge I've ever seen or paid) and emailed spouse phone number of hotel to call. Rang 18 times, disconnected. 鈥?Television broken. Asked and received new room.鈥?Computer downloading email from company server suddenly encounters very slow speeds on broadband system. Telephoned ISP, and told you're downloading too much so we slow you down to modem speed. Nothing would change their mind, all for $27.50 a day! 鈥?Hotel refused to intervene, said they are outside supplier.Rooms are OK, typical tired airport hotel rooms but clean and quiet.Business travelers with internet access needs should avoid at all cost . On my travels I have found these kinds of problems across Intercontinental-branded hotels in the region and I don't understand why this progressive company doesn't fix these problems in the south Pacific.

<Content>Not bad for a one night layover I had a one night layover in Sydney and wanted something close to the airport after coming off of a 14 hour flightSome good and bad things i noticed and experienced at the hotel are listed below:Good Points - has free airport to hotel shuttle that runs at regular 30 minute intervals (but there is a problem going from the hotel to the airport...read on below) - great service, staff are friendly and helpful - no complaints at all - nice lobby, classy - bar and restaurant easily accessible - room was clean (i got the king bed room on ninth floor), modern furnishings, spacious bathroom, bed was comfy (lots of pillows), free high speed internetBad Points - airport shuttle from hotel to the airport is billed at $5.00 - kinda funny considering the airport to the hotel shuttle is free - i thought that was cheap - smelly hallway (at least on the ninth floor) - as soon as you get off the elevator it hits you - a musty smell, made me wonder what kind of smell was waiting for me in my room (thank goodness my room didn't smell!) - carpets are well worn out in the hallway - it really stands out! the carpet is worn in front of all the doors - the food was ok - i would have said it was good but i had the unpleasant experience of the hot breakfast at the in-hotel restaurant Amelias - to be fair, there was a great spread of food, lots of fresh fruit with a wide variety, fresh baked pastries, lots of different juices - that part is good - but the hot breakfast was terrible - just thinking about it makes me wanna puke - the scrambled eggs were cold and watery, sausages were cold - there is no excuse for this, especially since i showed up at 5:30 am, when they open the restaurant, the food should be hot (or warm at least!)Verdict: I would stay there again for a layover only but icksnay on the hot breakfast

<Content>Not bad for the price Holiday Inn Sydney Airport is fairly conveniently located from Sydney Airport, although I would definitely not walk there with luggage.Upon arrival I realised that the room I was given did not smell very good - in fact it smelled pretty bad. So I called the reception and they promptly sent a porter up and gave me another room. The new room was perfectly fine. The size of the room was quite unremarkable - not too small, although not what I call spacious.There is a usable desk area and the bed was quite comfortable enough, and bathroom was functional. However, the decor was quite dated and the room was showing its age. I was not particularly expecting luxury or beautifully modern room so it was still quite OK.I was catching up with a friend in the lobby and wanted to get a cup of tea, but the breakfast area had closed. But they still let us sit there and order a pot of tea, which was rather kind of them.The staff were very friendly and it made up for the somewhat dated decor and the initial smelly room.

<Content>VFM We were only here 1 night, well 8 hours actually... but for an airport hotel I would say it was really nice! Great for an airport hop as its only 5 minutes away in a taxi.Check-in was good.Room was spacious and the bathroom of a good size with a great shower (always important). We were even able to pick up the premiership on the sky sports in the room - so that was a bonus! The bar area was nice and welcoming, but I suppose any bar is after a flight..VFM - value for money!

<Content>Great location We stayed at the Holiday Inn Sydney Airport one night prior to returning to Canada. This hotel is very convenient to the airport. It's comfortable and has a first class, reasonably priced shuttle service to the international terminal. Highly recommended for anyone needing accommodation near the airport.

<Content>Bad Service I didn't actually stay at the hotel as they had overbooked but I was not happy with how they resolved the problem......I had phoned the day before and booked the room and at the time told them that I would be checking in late (my flight was arriving at the airport at 10:30pm). At the time of booking I also asked would it be possible to get something to eat and was informed that the restaurant would be closed but I could get room service.On arrival at the airport I phoned the hotel to check the arrival time of the free shuttle from the terminal to the hotel and they took my name and details.When the shuttle pulled up at the hotel the duty manager was waiting outside and basically pushed us into a taxi which he had waiting whilst he was explaining that they had overbooked and didn't have a room available but he had booked us into a 4 star in the city and would pay for our taxi there and back to the airport the next morning (as we had an early morning flight the following day).I wouldn't get into the taxi until I had spoken to him properly and he seemed very anxious to get rid of us as quickly as possible. I asked him details of where we were staying, did he know it, how far away it was and did they have room service (as per my booking the day before this was something I specifically wanted). I was assured it was a lovely place and yes they did do room service.On arrival at our new destination I discovered it was a block of serviced appartments with no restaurant, room service or even anywhere to get a drink of water. I also don't think it was 4 star as the room was in a poor condition and the bathroom was dirty.I called the duty manager to inform him that I was not happy but at this stage it was almost midnight so I just gave up and went to sleep, thirsty and hungry!!I have never been able to get a satisfactory answer as to why when I had only made the booking the day before they overbooked and why when they had both my email address and mobile telephone number they did not contact me when they realised the problem.I am also not happy that the duty manager either lied to me or did not know what he was talking about.Obviously I can't comment on the hotel itself as I didn't even set foot inside the door but be aware if soemthing goes wrong you might not be happy with how they deal with it!!

<Content>convenient to the airport I used to stay at this hotel before it was renamed Holiday Inn - same hotel, same staff - different name is all. The difference was a doubling in their rates. This is NOT a $200 a night property.I used to be an airline pilot and used to stay at this hotel regularly - over 60 nights a year. It was ok - restaurant is very expensive but there is a little cafe next door which is reasonable where all the Qantas office workers go for their meals. Botany Road is a ten minute walk and there are many hole-in-the-wall restaurants there that are worth walking to. Out at the airport there is nothing to do, though - no nightlife or attractions of any kind, although this property offers convenience. It was great at arrive and get to this hotel after a long flight and crash into bed, so convenience is what they offer - but the rates are too high for the level of quality and they lose me there since it makes no sense to be paying this rate . The train station is a five minute walk and it's easy to go there and jump a train to the city center.Our rate was A$100 a night, and at that rate it was ok. Their present rates are just nuts! It's also getting worn - carpets are poor, bedspreads need cleaning. The place is either getting beaten to death or simply not being refurbished/maintained.

<Content>Helpfull front desk staff I arrived on a flight from Darwin in the early evening, checked in and needed to get to Olympic Stadium (now Telstra Stadium) straight away to see a rugby match. I debated about taking a taxi (would cost a fortune) and the desk staff went out of their way to explain how to find the train (the Mascot station is 2 minutes from the front door) and which trains to change to. Their instructions worked like a charm and it was a quick and easy way to get there and cheap.It's often the little things that leave a lasting impression.

<Content>Decent and convenient for layovers, less than 5 mins from airport To echo the sentiments of previous reviewers, this is a decent, convenient place for a one-night layover. It's less than five minutes from the airport, so it won't take long to get settled in your room, and you can arrive back at the airport in plenty of time for your flight.Rooms meet the usual business hotel standards--clean and decently appointed.Checkout is 11am, but you can request to extend it to 12 noon, which is nice if you came in on a late flight and need some time to recover before flying out of Sydney.The hotel is smack in the middle of an industrial park area, so you won't be walking to restaurants or touristy stuff. The hotel has a restaurant and cafe/bar, and the room service was ok. Take the nearby subway if you want to get into Sydney.A taxi from the airport to the hotel was AUD $10. You could also catch the hotel shuttle, which is slower but free. Taking the hotel shuttle back to the airport costs AUD $5/person, but the shuttles are convenient, reliable, and frequent, running every 30-45 minutes during peak periods. You'll need to book your place on the shuttle back to the airport--book it either when you check in, or the morning of your flight.

<Content>A bit of a smell Looked around for a comfortable hotel to stay for a night in Sydney before flying to Canberra the next day, some of the hotels around the airport are terrible so I thought I would protect myself by paying a bit more for some where clean and comfortable.I opted for the Holiday Inn based on reviews from tripadvisor. The shuttle bus took quite a while before it arrived, then we had to sit through the traffic in the domestic terminal before we reached the hotel. The whole journey including wait time took 1 hour 10mins, I would get a cab instead if you decide to stay here.Check in - quick and efficientRoom - The reviewer in January must have got a more modern room than myself as my room looked old and stale and was crying out for a refirbushiment. Plus side was the room was very large.Bath room - Very simple and clincally, but once again like the room needed an update, the other major negative was that the sink and the toilet had an eggy smell coming out of it, which required the bathroom door to be shut otherwise you could smell it from your bed. Not nice!The staff are friendly and offer good advice, but for the price I paid was disappointed, maybe worth paying an extra few pounds and staying somewhere more modern.

<Content>Not good Booked this hotel as my husband works in the area and we just wanted a night away from the kids. From the time I walked in there were problems. I booked a king size room and was told it would be on the top floor, but oh no it was on the first floor, when I complained I was told there were no other kingsize rooms available. Check in time was 2.00pm room was still not available at 3.10, I was then offered a free cup of cofee, which I declined. I was then given free overnight parking and a bottle of champagne but this did nothing to apese the bitter taste in my mouth. I am the type of person I like to get what I paid for not given freebies for poor service. Hotel could also do with a refurbishment. Reception staff were nice and polite in dealing with my problem but it should never have occured. Would not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>good Airport Hotel This is a very good airport hotelvery nice rooms, clean and very friendly staff, they have shuttle to the airport and the hotel is just 1 block from the subway station, I麓ve overnigthed here for an early morning flight to US, so it is pretty much recomended, it is a little bit expensive, but it worth it, so if it is within your budget, this is a very very good option

<Content>Good hotel for layovers We didn't have many expectations for this hotel except that it was close to the airport. We had spent 1 1/2 weeks in Australia and had an early morning flight. The hotel was clean and the room was a good size. The hotel had a shuttle service which provided transportation to the airport. You are also close enough to walk if you are returning a rental car.

<Content>Ditto! Great Crash Pad Totally agree with other reviewers. Great overnight place to stay when just passing through. NIce Hotel. Friendly and helpful Staff. They did everything for me except but put a shrimp on the barbie. The hotel isn't located near anything for the tourist except the AIrport. A train station is only 300M away. It cost us A$7.50 round trip each to Circular Quay. Pick up a schedule at the station. At the Airport there is a FREE dedicated Holiday Inn Sydney Airport Shuttle at Zone # 6. The Hotel is listed on the sign there. However, the shuttle will cost A$5 each person from the Hotel to the Domistic/International Terminal.

<Content>Great airport hotel! This was an excellent 鈥渃rash pad鈥?after our long flight across Australia with a need to overnight at the Sydney airport before traveling to the States the next day. What made it excellent was the staff. Everyone from the shuttle bus driver to the receptionist to the porter made us feel welcome.  The room was more spacious than most Australian hotel rooms and it was clean, comfortable and quiet. All the amenities were there and everything worked perfectly. The room service food was excellent (great scrambled eggs!) and was delivered quickly and hot. A very good property that is recommendable if you need to stay near Sydney airport.

<Content>good for an airport hotel After a 24 hour flight from the UK, this hotel was great for an overnight stay/catch up on your sleep sort of place. Great blackout blinds, quiet. The family rooms were large and clean. Consierge service punctual. Breakfast was great too. Staff were polite and welcoming

<Content>Overbooking Warning! I'm sure this is a lovely hotel but sadly despite booking a room weeks in advance of our stay (and providing credit card details for payment), we arrived very tired after an evening internal flight to find our room was not available. Be aware when booking a room here that this hotel operates a deliberate over-booking policy - confirmation of your reservation is no guarantee a room will be available to you. A room at another hotel 20 minutes away was arranged for us which was ok-ish but this experience was not really how we wanted to end our trip to Australia.

<Content>Good Ariport Hotel (ideal location for Sydney Domestic Terminal) Exactly what I want from an airport hotel. Good sound insulation between rooms, blackout curtains for day time sleeping, air conditioning that actually holds a temperature and is fairly quiet, and a shower that works well.Very convenient for the domestic terminal (two sets of lights on a straight road). Shuttle bus (per person charge) that I didn't use, but seemed well organized with a large closed trailer for the luggage and at least two mid size busses in use when I was there.Parking is under cover, you can self park or have a valet do it for you. You need to leave your keys with the concierge, so they can shuffle cars around to make maximum use of their space by double and triple parking. Once you've paid for parking you get a card that will let you escape the car park, or let the valet do the work.Breakfast buffet from 5:30 was too late for my early flight, so consider check in time before you take a package with breakfast.

<Content>Great location, great hotel One of the nicer Holiday Inns I've stayed at. Great location to the airport - the shuttle to the hotel is free - you have to pay a nominal price ($4) to get back to the airport which I thought was a bit cheaky. Paid $145 Aus for a very nice room. Nice staff. Would stay there again.

<Content>Great hotel We stayed overnight in February after an overseas trip on our way home to Queensland.We arrived about 9pm, ordered a meal (which was great). The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. Bed was great!After a long flight we just wanted a good night's sleep, which we got! Room service that nightwas good, we had it for breakfast and it was great!Lots of lotions and potions in the bathroom and i used the bath bomb to have the best bath i'd had since i'd left home!Friendly staff, very helpful and a cheap shuttle service back to the airport for our flight home the next day. Also a bottle of champage as it was our honeymoon - nice!For $144 AUD, money well spent, would definately stay there again..

<Content>Good for stopovers - not a holiday hotel We stayed here between a 10 hour flight from the USA and flying home early the next morning to canberra. we had stayed here before for work and had our bill charged twice but this time, the service was great.We had booked via [-------] from Hawaii and on arrival were told only a smoking room was available. Once we turned the aircon on, it was fine. The bed was fabulous and the room spotless.I would recommed this hotel for it's close proximity to the airport (shuttles start from 5am and run on the 1/2 hr from then - AU$2 p/p) but it's not a place you would stay when coming to Sydney on a holdiay. They say it's a quick taxi ride/drive to the city, it's not. The train runs close by, but you don't want to be riding that after dark!

<Content>Convenient for stop-overs I've stayed here a few times now and it was the first hotel I stayed in when I first got to Australia. I primarily booked it because it has a free airport shuttle (which you catch near McDonald's) and because it offeres high-speed internet in-room (for a fee). The first time was a nice stay with rooms clean and spacious. The second time (when I desperately needed the internet) they informed me that it is down and not working and that they were sorry and didn't offer me any more advice. The restaurants are uninspiring - I ended up eating in-room and for the price, it's just a clean hotel with comfortable beds. Service is a bit amature for an airport hotel that deals with so many international customers.

<Content>From now on this will be my base in Sydney if time is an issue! I fully agree with the review stating that this is the best choice if you want to be close to the airport and you do not have much time.The nearby rail station of Mascot enables you to get to just about any Sydney location within half an hour.Great rooms, professional staff who are very friendly and helpful!

<Content>Short on time-stay here Not wanting to endure a long rail trip to the airport for a morning flight I opted to stay at the Holiday Inn, Sydney Airport. The location is convienient and an easy walk from the Mascot City Rail station. The hotel shuttle is a nominal AU $4.00. An easy, safe, walk to Mascot station  all of Sydney area is within easy reach. Usual airport pricing for food, however the drink prices were reasonable for the area. Don't plan on walking to any resturants as the area is mostly large commercial complexes. Take the rail as mentioned above. You can negotiate a rate on the weekends. Check your bill upon checkout as I found my billing was $10.00 above the rate quoted upon checkin. Probably an oversight as there was no problem in obtaining adjustment.

<Content>Restaurant Woes We have also stayed at the Holiday Inn on several occasions and each time have had problems with the hotel's restaurant. Bad service mostly, and on one occasion it was an hour before the meal was served! Not what you need when either coming off a long flight or preparing for one.

<Content>Serves the Purpose (overnight stopover etc..) My daughter and I arrived at the Holiday Inn Syd Airport at 6pm, we had just got off an international flight (as a lot of guests do). We went to have a meal in the restaurant, but sadly we were informed we should have booked ahead as there wasn't a table for two available until 8pm.(It was Wed night) Being an 'airport hotel' how do you book ahead for the restaurant?? We didn't want to sit around for 2 hrs and wait for a table to become available, we wanted to eat, have a shower and get some sleep. Isn't this what most travellers want? We went to our room where we tried to book a wakeup call and an airport bus for the following morning, an answering machine said to leave all the details and the hotel staff would listen to the message later and book call and bus. I just didn't feel comfortable talking to a machine about my wakeup time and my 5am airport bus. Maybe it was the overwhelming sense of efficiency I didn't get when I checked in that worried me. I phoned the reception to ask if I could verify the message left on the machine. They assured me it was ok. It was. We were awoken the next morning on time and took the bus on time. The rooms were extremely spacious and acturally quite luxurious. The bed was a king single even though we were assured it was a double by reservation staff. We made do. Basically the extra frequent flyer points I earned for staying at Hol. Inn were almost worth it.
