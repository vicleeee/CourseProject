<Content>our "home" in florence We lived a glorious week at Hotel Colomba in # 13 - a spacious room, lots of storage space, large window with shutters looking out on courtyard - when closed it was very quiet for sleeping but we liked to have it open so we could wake up listening to the church bells of the duomo and st marks as the hotel is centrally located in the heart of florence !!So much has been written about the loveliness of florence but when one is treated almost as a family member by rosanna, michel, their sons, and sabina at the scrumptious breakfast every morning and the extra attention to all details of the lodging, the travel experience just cannot be matched !!We were on a trip of 67 days - these 7 days were the icing on the cake ! Hope to return again to our home at Hotel Colomba !

<Content>From one successful Hotelier to another - the Rossi family Within 10 minutes of arriving in Florence by Terravision Coach from Pisa Airport I was separated (a Scotsman) from my wallet and its contents, a considerable amount of cash and several plastic cards so be warned. My loss was discovered when the Taxi dropped my wife and I at The Columba. Thank the Lord Roseanna, the lady of the house was on duty, as she always seemed to be, to hear my sad tale. She immediately went out and paid the taxi and stuffed some notes in my hand to relieve my destitution. This is not intended to be an invitation for any wrong minded person to take advantage of!!That was the down side of our short visit. Roseanna's professional attention to detail from our registration to the end of our stay remained attententive in every detail and of a very high friendly standard. My wife and I have no great knowledge of the Itialian language but that was overcome by Roseanna's perfect English. My wife and I who have been in the hotel business for many years would thoroughly recommend The 3 * Columba to anyone visiting Firenze, it's location is most suitable for the many attractions in the City and within walking distance. Our room was worthy of at least another star rating, the hotel was spotless, linen changed daily, the satelight TV offered all European stations plus CNN and BBC worldwide. I am a good eater especially at breakfast and have to say that the included continental breakfast was more than I expected for the inclusive bed and breakfast rate. The regular staff have been with the Rossi's for many years which speaks for itself and her son Angelo is not a bad judge of the local eateries thank you for your recommendation.Not forgetting the Patron who I am sure understands more English than he allows himself to speak.Molto Grazie to you all for treating us as guests and not just room numbersBetty  Derick Ross

<Content>A respite in Florence My wife and I had just flown into Rome to find out our bags did not land with us. We were moving fast and hard through Italy in the early days of this trip so the less than reassuring, Ehh, we'll find you at some point and deliver the bags in the next 3-5 days, from Alitalia a game killer. This threw our initial logistics into disarray; the comfortable train rides into Florence from Rome became let's wait for our bags to arrive 3 hours later, miss our trains and switch our reservations with Hertz to get the car now and drive to Florence instead. I had never driven in Italy much less the autostrada at night, fortunately I'm from Boston so it was easy. We arrived in Florence well after midnight and got to the Hotel Colomba where we were greeted by a very kind gentleman who helped us to our room and explained the room and hotel amenities. Additionally he took the time to explain our location relative to Florence's many attractions. The hotel was clean, the room was large and the staff incredibly helpful. We were only in Florence for the night but we had a great night's sleep and a delicious breakfast before we pushed off. I left behind one of my favorite shirts and did not realize it until the end of the trip. I called the hotel and spoke with the owner who graciously offered to mail the shirt to me. Not only did she mail it she sent it priority entirely at her expense. That is the kind of above and beyond customer service that I place great value on as a consumer. The Colomba Hotel is a superior value and offers amazing customer service. Highly recommended.

<Content>ABOVE and BEYOND GREAT Everything about this hotel was absolutely wonderful. We arrived for check in, Sabina gave us a detailed map of nearby restaurants and helped us get our bearings before turning us loose in Florence. Someone was always at the front desk to greet us as we returned, no matter the time of day or night. Our room was spotless and always clean when we returned. Breakfast had more choices than we could eat, we never felt rushed, coffee was the best ever.Upon returning to the states, we realized we should have made a purchase for something while we were there. We needed someone in Florence to make a cash purchase on our behalf so we contacted Sabina for her assistance. They were very gracious to take the time and make our purchase with their cash and ship it to us. We promptly sent our credit card info and the transaction was flawless. If you want an excellent location in Florence, superb service and cleanliness, the Hotel Colomba should be your first choice.We will hopefully return someday and will only stay at the Hotel Colomba.

<Content>Friendly service. Great location. We stayed at this hotel, along with another couple, for 2 nights in July and had a very enjoyable stay. The location is excellent! We arrived in Florence via train and walked to the hotel - normally about a 15 minute walk. It took us a little longer as it was quite hot and humid out which slowed us down a bit. The hotel is located one floor up from the street and has an elevator鈥t鈥檚 small, holds about 3 people but this is typical for Europe and a bonus as not all hotels in Italy have one. We were warmly greeted by Rosanna at the reception desk and were quickly checked into our rooms. My husband and I had a huge room with a queen bed and single bed and lots of space besides. It was spotlessly clean and had a recently updated bathroom (shampoo/soap supplied). The other couple had a much smaller room and their bathroom had a bidet in the shower but overall also very clean and similarly equipped. (Note that room size can vary greatly in older European hotels. Many were originally large residences that were converted to hotels with various units created out of whatever rooms they had to work with, not all of the same size). The rooms had safes, bar fridges and air conditioning which was much appreciated given the time of year. The only complaint was that the bath towels are too thin.Prior to our trip to Florence one of our traveling companions called Rosanna to make reservations to see some of the attractions. Rosanna was more than happy to make the arrangements and have them ready for our arrival. We highly recommend that you do this or you may wait hours in line to see the major attractions 鈥?with a reservation you can skip the lineup! Generally the hotel is in a great location and within walking distance of the Duomo, Galleria Accademia, San Lorenzo leather market, train station, restaurants and shops. Breakfast was complimentary with the rooms and every day had a good selection of bread, pastries, cheeses, meats, boiled eggs, fruit, cereal, yogurt, tea and juices.The cheerful staff made us coffee to order, including lattes and cappuccinos (delicious!). Free internet was available in the hotel which we used several times. Overall the hotel was great. The location was excellent, the staff were very friendly, more than willing to help with reservations or give us directions or information, the rooms were comfortable. We鈥檇 highly recommend it to anyone who visits Florence.

<Content>Like a second home My husband and I, my elderly parents, and another couple booked rooms at the Hotel Colomba for five nights in October, 2008. I stayed there with my daughter two years ago and knew I would go back if I ever had the chance to travel in Italy again. The hotel is close to the Medici-Riccardi Palace, the Duomo, the Accademia, and San Lorenzo and there is a bus stop just outside the door for several local bus routes. I remembered the rooms were airy and spacious, and meticulously clean. The breakfasts were great and the conversation over breakfast with our hosts was even better.The owner/ managers of this small hotel succeeded once again this Fall in making our experience of Florence better in every way. They picked rooms that suited the needs of my parents for quietness and accessibility, helped us send laundry out when necessary and translated the mysterious messages on our Italian cell phones for us when we couldn't figure them out. Their attention to our needs went way above and beyond the expected.The support staff were equally eager to help whenever they could to make reservations for us at museums, call cabs, and suggest restaurants. They even helped with finding a doctor who could make a visit (same-day) to the hotel when my mother fell ill during our trip.We were in and out all day long when various people in our party needed to rest and every single time we came past the desk we were greeted by someone with a smile and an answer to a question if we had one. If you are looking for a place to call home in Florence you could not make a better choice than the Hotel Colomba.

<Content>Clean and safe hotel My husband and I stayed at Hotel Colomba for 3 nights during our stay in Florence. One of the highlights of staying here was Rosanna, who runs the hotel, and her family  staff. Everyone was very friendly and helpful with everything! They gave us information on everything we asked about, and Rosanna also made ticket reservations for us at the Accademie and Uffizi. Because Rosanna and her family live in the hotel premises, you feel a bit safer and it makes it feel more like home. Although a drawback to this is that because they live there, some guests will have to walk through a computer room/office and living room to get to their room. The sons were sitting there on a number of occasions but they are always friendly when you walk by. Our room was very very clean!! They do a good job of keeping everything spotless. The one thing that kind of grossed me out was that the bidet was in the shower, but again, the bidet looked pretty spotless :) The breakfast buffet is enough to fill you until lunch. It includes cereal, bread, pastries, prosciutto, cheeses, yogurt, and fruit. Rosanna also makes cappuccinos, lattes, etc. for you. There is also a computer for guests to use internet which was free and very helpful in keeping in touch with family.Overall, this hotel is a clean, comfortable stay. I recommend this to anyone looking for a cozy, safe, clean, and affordable hotel!

<Content>Service with a smile! We arrived in Florence a bit out of sorts but immediately Sabina put us at ease and gave us a warm Florence welcome! She provided us directions and tips to make our 4 day stay enjoyable including do the David at 8:15am then come back to the hotel for a lovely English breakfast, Sienna by bus and do-it-yourself tour, etc. Other staff members were also very friendly and wanted to make our stay as pleasant as possible.Conveniently located to center of Florence making it possible to see many things with the option of coming back to rest or put shopping things in the room. As a wandering American, it was nice to get CNN to keep up with the latest news and other satellite TV broadcasts.Room was larger by European standards and AC avaiable. Bathroom towels were too thin for comfort.Recommend it for it's friendly staff and convenicence to central Florence.

<Content>great place Excellent find! Clean, large room, in the heart of Florence. Noisy street but with the new windows you cannot hear a thing. The proprietors are English (or at least one of them is) and the entire staff is English-speaking and very helpful. This was the best accommodation AND the best value of our entire European trip. I wish we had stayed longer.

<Content>Nice family hotel Stayed with the family one night. The staff were very friendly and flexible. It was quite expensive, but then again so is everything in Florence...The location is excellent - a very short walk to all the sites - and we walked with two small children! Free wireless access was a definate bonus for us.The only minus for us was that the fire alarm went off early in the morning. Apparently there is something wrong with the electrical system, although I can't quite see how the one has an effect on the other...

<Content>nice friendly hotel Nice hotel. The accomodation met the criteria we were looking for: clean, comfortable, air conditionning, excellent location.Generous breakfast buffet.The managers, a friendly family, besides italian, speak english and french. The parking system is what you would find anywhere in the center of this city where there are not so many parking areas: the hotel has to make a request for you to stay 15mn on the street so that you can unload your luggage , and then you need to drive to the parking (I'm not so sure if they're working with the hotel). No problem with the parking either (I'm mentioning it because some parkings can be tight for the width of your car).

<Content>Hotel Colomba...great value Hotel Colomba is a great find. The room was very spacious  clean. Real value for money and conveniently located. We could walk from the train station and the Galleria n San Lorenzo Market was just a few minutes walk away from the hotel. Also, the staff was just so helpful and friendly. Sabina gave us great tips on how to beat the queues for all the tourist attractions and in getting our train tickets without the queues! Breakfast was plenty and coffee/tea personally prepared by Rossana was an extra nice touch. I will remember Hotel Colomba fondly.....Ciao

<Content>great people A little hard to find - they need some better signage on the street - but a wonderful hotel. The family was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful and accomodating. Breakfasy buffet was excellent. Room was spacious and comfortable - including the bathroom. The air conditioning work very well. If we go back to Florence we wouldn't think about shopping for a hotel - we'd book the Hotel Columba immediately.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Columba The Hotel Colomba was a wonderful find. The rooms were clean and roomy. We booked a quad for my husband and myself and our two little girls and another double for our two boys. We were right next door to each other which was very nice. We arrived in the morning and they were so accomodating. They kept our luggage and fed most of us breakfast while my husband went and parked the car. We had to get to the Uffizzi for a 10:30 appointment and we made it from the hotel in 15 minutes. We were walking pretty fast but it wasn't difficult. There is no curfew, which we have found at some hotels, and that was a nice aspect of this hotel. The breakfast room is very nice and the food was plentiful and good. The caffe was great and they even made hot chocolate for our children. Very, very sweet! We felt at home immediately. Beds were comfortable and the rooms were quiet. We stayed in Siena for one night and while we loved our little apartment it was quite noisy and without air conditioning. These rooms at the Hotel Columba are nicely air conditioned. The shower in the quad was a little small but only by American standards not European. The bathroom in the double was quite nice. Everything was very clean. We found the price to be moderate to low, especially for what we found. Walking to this hotel from all the sites was quite easy. We will be back!

<Content>Delighted with Hotel Colomba We spent 5 nights in August 08 in Colomba after a wedding in Tuscany and we were absolutely delighted with our choice of hotel which had been found on internet by mother of the groom! Its central location was perfect for all the sight-seeing we wanted to do and we had great time visiting the market in San Lorenzo around the corner and shopping! The hotel, like so many , is on the second floor and there is a lift up,small but efficient. The bedroom had everything you needed, TV, hairdryer, bathroom though small was well-fitted with good size shower. The staff was lovely and the 'piece de resistence' was Rosanne, the proprietor. What a smashing person-never hassled and always willing to help. I was sick one of the days and she brought tea and toast to me in bed! I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone I know going to Florence. One small point re location is that I do not think the railway station is quite near enough to walk to Colomba with luggage and would suggest one takes a taxi. Because we were 8 people Rosanne organised a mini-bus to Pisa airport and this was terrific and was reasonable cost. We also got to stop in Pisa to look at the Leaning Tower.

<Content>Comfy hotel in a great location The Hotel Colomba's location is very good... just a few minutes walk north to the Galleria or south to the Duomo, and maybe a 15 minute walk to the Ufizzi or river. The room was basic, but very clean and comfortable with a regular bathroom and a small flat-screen TV. The room had its own air conditioner, which managed to just keep up with the 95F (36C) temperatures outside each day. Wireless internet is available and free of charge.The hostess, Rosanna, is very helpful and speaks perfect English after her 20 years in Australia. Breakfast was excellent and included great coffee, prosciutto, cheese, boiled eggs, rolls, and juice.The hotel is up a couple of flights of stairs (or small elevator) in an unremarkable building that also houses other businesses. You won't feel like you are walking into luxury as you enter the hotel's building, but a nice room, solid breakfast, and great hostess await you. Overall, this hotel was an excellent value. While not luxurious, it is a great option for those seeking a reasonably priced, comfortable home base for exploring Florence.

<Content>Sweet, homey, hospitable hotel We stayed for just one night in a quad room. The room was spacious(huge), immacutely clean and comfortable. The owners and staff made us feel at home immediately with their warm welcome.If you're looking for a reasonably priced hotel close to everything then this is the place to book.The breakfast was just great. Internet was free. The positive comments made by other reviewers are exactly true. We would love to visit Florence again and would happily stay here again.

<Content>A child friendly gem!! At Hotel Colomba we found a gem of a place. it had everything we could have hoped for in a hotel...clean...large rooms...friendly staff. The manager spoke perfect English and had lots of suggestions for things we could go see and do. It was in easy distance to many attractions which made moving around the city with children so much easier as we could duck back for a siesta and then go out again, later for a gelato!! I dont hesitate to recommend this place!!

<Content>Perfect 10 location and management It says it was a 3 star hotel -- it's a 5 star hotel for location as we were able to come back to the hotel throughout the day to freshen up or drop off our purchases. The manager/owners are 5 star helpful and pleasant, very refreshing especially after a stay in Paris. We had a quad room, which was bigger than we expected. There was plenty of room for the 4 of us adults. Bathroom was a bit small but that's to be expected. We had access to a computer down the hall with FREE internet, which was great to have in this email world. There wasn't any problems using it even though it was just one computer for the entire hotel. Breakfast was included and a nice way to start the day. The owners are very nice and give you good service, good value which was especially welcomed with a weak US dollar. They were always so helpful and weren't out to get every penny or rather dollar from us.

<Content>Good price, has everything one needs This isn't a luxury hotel, of course, so don't expect that. But it's a very nice hotel for the price, and it offers everything that a tourist could ask for:-a great location in the heart of Florence, equidistant from the Piazza della Signoria area and the more northern sites like the Accademia-very friendly, charming, and accommodating staff, in fact it's family-run, it seems-a good continental breakfast, including especially good coffee-very good air-conditioning in your room; perfect after hot days spent sightseeing-a good, strong shower-more than decent beds-free wi-fi that worked wellI'd definitely return here.

<Content>Clean, spacious, air conditioned, and excellent hospitality My sister, boyfriend and I all enjoyed our stay tremendously. The room we were given was very spacious, and it remained cold and air conditioned throughout our stay. The bathroom was quite large, and the rooms were immaculately cleaned by housekeeping each day. Moreover, the COMPLIMENTARY morning breakfast was fantastic: we enjoyed fresh apricot juice, orange juice, a spread of pastries, hard boiled eggs, fruits, a selection of cereals, yogurts, and a choice of made-to-order caffeinated drinks. I highly rec the lattes. They were delicious. The hotel itself is run by an Italian family, and they were both accommodating and entirely professional. They seemed to genuinely care how we enjoyed our stay, and the gentleman/owner went out of his way to inquire how we liked our room a couple hours after our check-in. If you are visiting Florence to see the sites, this is the ideal location. I can't imagine a hotel that is better centrally-located to the Uffizi, Academia, and the churches. Last but certainly not least, the Hotel Colomba is extremely affordable. I'm almost sad to give such a glowing review since I fear this little gem will be mobbed and sold out by the time I return.

<Content>Worth a return visit The Hotel Colomba was just wonderful. We had an extended stay, and it really was like a home away from home. The staff are helpful, friendly, and generous with suggestions without being invasive. The location is excellent, minutes away from the Duomo, and in close walking distance to everything. Our room was incredibly comfortable, and well fitted out, and we really appreciated the extra touches that helped us feel connected, (such as free access to internet). The Colomba allowed us some very peaceful down time (and great breakfast!) in the midst of the excitement that Florence provides. We will definitely be back!

<Content>Loved it!! I stayed at hotel Colomba 2 nights ago with my family and we absolutely adored it! The location is perfect, 2 minutes from the Duomo, the leather market, the David and other sites. The rooms were VERY large, so comfortable and nicely air conditioned. The wireless is free which is a HUGE bonus. We felt very safe staying there, as there is staff in the lobby 24/7. Most importantly, the staff was unbelievable. We were truly sad to say goodbye because the family was so good to us. They went out of their way to make us feel at home, gave us directions to multiple requests and chatted with us when we were hangin around the lounge area. It was so refreshing seeing their faces each time we entered the hotel, it was an escape from the frustrations of travel. It was truly a joy staying there and it would be a pleasure to go back and stay at Hotel Colomba again.The Pade's :)

<Content>bad experience I travel to Florence quite often for my work, this is the worst hotel i have ever been in this cityThe hotel is a small one, owned by a family. The position is excellent but the hotel is not. I was given a room which had the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in my life. During the first night there was a fire allarm, it was stopped but nobody gave any explanation for that. In the morning I received a wake up call...but I had never asked one....again nobody apologized for that. Finally, during the night the owners were staying in the breakfast room (close to some of the bedrooms) smoking and watching tv. if you can i strongly suggest to book hotel casci instead of this one, less expensive and much better!

<Content>Amazing Myself and my three fellow travelers landed in Florence with some idea of where to stay gleamed from the Lonely Planet guide. The hotel we'd picked was booked up but the owner took us down the street to Hotel Colomba where he introduced us to Rosanna and asked that we were given a good rate. Rosanna delivered. We were shown to a very clean and large triple room. We were told about the free internet access and the free continental breakfast. We were given maps and directions to the Galleria dell'Accademia to see David. It was all very personal and very friendly.We stayed only the one night so we checked out the next morning but were allowed to leave our packs while we toured around the city some more. Before leaving we had breakfast and the opportunity to meet the owner. He was very gracious and courteous thanking us for choosing his hotel. Believe me when I tell you that staying at Hotel Colomba is akin to staying with family. They are very nice and hospitable and the rooms are clean and spacious. Hotel Colomba should be your choice for accomodations in Florence.And be sure to check out the super cute salt and pepper shakers.

<Content>Perfect Hotel for Florence May 28-31- 2008My daughter and I stayed at Hotel Colomba. When we arrived, Sabena had reserved tickets for the Academia and Uffizi. The hotel owners and Sabena were so helpful giving directions and making recommendations. The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to everything in Florence. The rooms were very clean and very safe. The breakfast was fine.I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Home Away from Home This was my second visit to Hotel Colomba in as many years and as cliched as it sounds the simple things in life are often the best. Hotel Colomba offers a warm friendly environment, wonderfully large, clean rooms, fantastic breakfast and an outstanding location. My husband and I will be frequent visitors of Hotel Colomba and Florence for years to come. Thank you Rosanna and Sabina for making our stay so enjoyable.

<Content>Best of Florence My hubby and I have just spent two lovely weeks in Italy, finishing our trip in wonderful Firenze. We had no hotel reservation and just walked into Hotel Colomba on Via Cavour on spec. Luckily they had a double room, nicely decorated with aircon, satellite TV, safe, free internet plus WiFi and minibar - all for 鈧?18/night!! It is just a stone's throw from the Duomo and Uffizzi and the train station is walkable, or a short taxi ride if you have lots of bags. Also there is a lovely ambience to the street.Before we even checked in Sabina, the most helpful person we met the whole trip, made a few calls and organised reservations for the Uffizzi and Accademia (very useful if you don't like to queue). Plus she found us a cheap parking place nearby. (BTW a car is a nusence in Florence). Breakfast was great, hubby loved the eggs and the rest! The owners, Roseanna and her husband were so pleasant and helpful it made our last two days in Italy very special. We both highly recommend this hotel to any traveller who needs a stress free zone. We plan to return.

<Content>Very Fulfiling Stay at the Columba Just got back with my wife from a two week vacation in Italy. We stayed at Florence for four nights. Rossana and Sabrina were really helpful. Rooms were clean and nice. I twisted my foot while walking in Rome and Rosanna was very helpful in providing ice and caring for me. Very personal nice warm touch which you would not find in any hotel. Sabrina was helpful in providing suggestions on tours and places of interests. They are really nice people and you should go ahead and strike up a conversation with them. Location was very good too. Near to station and major important places of interests. Free WIFI access and also free terminal in passageway for internet access. Rossana's hubby was also very nice and caring.My trip was made much better even though I hurt my foot while walking in Rome and swell my foot, thanks to their care and concern.

<Content>Wonderful Small Hotel Hotel Colomba is a small hotel in center city, Florence. It is hosted by a family who are incredibly lovely and hospitable folks. We stayed in a triple room, which was very spacious and very quiet. Everything was immaculate. All the staff/family were helpful and accommodating. The complementary breakfast was fresh, enjoyable and just the right amount of food for the morning, including made-to-order coffee /tea drinks. There was a safe in the room which was very convenient. All our needs were met by the very responsive staff. The Duomo is only 2 blocks away. This hotel is a gem and we would definitely return should we visit Florence again. We highly recommend it.

<Content>Good value for the price Hotel Colomba has a great location, It is on a main street providing easy walking distance to most of the downtown atttractions and shopping. The Duomo and Gioto's bell tower are only 5 minutes walk witk retail and local merchant shops within 10-15 minutes walk of the hotel. The hotel was on the 2nd(3rd in U.S.) floor of a commercial/residencial building. The property was decently maintained but lacked any frills. Our room was directly behind the reception desk(we could hear everything going on out there from our room, and are sure of the reverse). Room size was particularly large with a vaulted ceiling and we had a balcony overlooking other windows and drying laundry. The bathroom was rather small with a stand-up shower and the wall with all of the fixtures attached directly abbutting the reception desk wall (...see my previous note on privacy). Breakfast was very good, the standard in Italy, breads, meats, cheeses, fresh cappuccino. Service was courteous and helpful so overall it was a good value for its location but don't expect much more.

<Content>Just perfect for our family The rooms, service and amenities were above our expectations for such a reasonable price. It is ideally located to walk to the Academia and the Duomo. We are a family of 6 and spent our Easter holiday very comfortably in 2 spacious rooms! The owners and staff could not be more friendly and accommodating. The breakfast buffet had something for everyone and the cappuccino was fantastic! As is the case with reasonably priced hotels the internet was free and they had WiFi! This was a blessing for our teens to keep up with their social networking!! If the weather had given us more days of sun, our stay would have been perfect.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel - Great Location My husband and I stayed at Hotel Colomba for three nights during the first week of April. We chose this hotel based on the TA reviews, and found it to be as nice as the reviews had promised it to be. The staff was extremely helpful, the hotel was super clean, our room was spacious enough for us, internet was free, breakfast was nice and location was extremely convenient. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others and would stay there again if we had the chance to visit Florence again. By the way, Florence is fantastic!!

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Great Location My husband, myself and our teenage son stayed at Hotel Colomba five days during a two week trip and could not be more pleased with our choice. The staff, especially Roseanna and Sabina could not have been more helpful, friendly and accomodating - and this includes the months prior to booking the trip when I would email with questions. They recommended a tour group I was very happy with and could use in Venice, Florence and Rome.Breakfast was plentiful and always fresh. This was the only location where I felt the coffee was hot enough (I know coffee is drunk here lukewarm - I like it piping hot).The hotel is centrally located with all sights a short walk away.The free internet was a lifesaver as my teenage son was sorely missing his computer and the satellite tv was a great touch.I highly recommend staying here - I agree with many of the prior reviews - staying here is like staying with friends.

<Content>Hotel Columba....A Fine Choice!!! Hotel Columba ,Florence ....A fine choice!We booked our stay based purely on the reviews from tripadvisor and could not have been more delighted . The hotel is close to the station and in a superb location for all that Florence has to offer. The lift up to the second floor where the hotel is located was much appreciated on our arrival with cases. Rosanna's welcome was warm and so personal. Our room was large and spotless,the bed huge and comfortable. The bedding was changed each day. Breakfast was more than ample and delicious....the coffee super!!!! I don't believe there is anywhere in and around Florence Rosanna doesn't know. Her directions and recommendations were always spot-on. Quite simply excellent .We are about to book a return.

<Content>A Wonderful Stay Just returned from our stay at the Hotel Colomba. What a wonderful place to stay! The location is fabulous. You can truly walk anywhere from the hotel. And Rosanne and her staff are truly as welcoming as everyone has mentioned. After a week on the road and an entire day spent traveling on buses, trains, and taxis, it was a welcome relief when Rosanne greeted us. The entire staff was very helpful. We were three generations staying in a triple near the front desk, so were very pleased there was a lift to the second floor. The room was very clean and spacious. The shower was quite small, but this was a minor inconvenience. The breakfasts were very good with pastries, cereal, cheeses and fresh fruit (the first hotel during our trip to offer fresh fruit!). Easter morning, we were delighted to uncover our napkin to find three chocolate eggs on each plate! And the free internet access was put to use due to an emergency back home. We will definately stay at Hotel Colomba for any future visits to Florence.

<Content>Great family run hotel!!! My husband and I, with our 2 children aged 9 and 13, stayed at Hotel Colomba on 21st and 22nd March 2008. I decided to book this hotel after reading the many positive reviews on tripadvisor. I was definitely satisfied with our stay in this little but very comfortable hotel. The hotel is located on the 2nd floor of a building in a commercial street (Via Cavour). The location is wonderful, as all the most important sights in Florence are at a walking distance. Lovely restaurants all around. Our room was spacious for four people, quiet and really clean (my children have allergy problems and so cleanliness is absolutely fundamental for us). Bathroom small but new and clean. One the highlights is the kindness and helpfulness of the owners and of Sabina who works for them. They really made us feel comfortable.Breakfast in the morning was good with cereals, bread, fresh fruit, eggs, ham, cheese, pastries, yogurt, jam and fruit juices. Cappuccino, coffee, tea, hot chocolate....all we needed to start a walking tour in a wonderful city.It was a pleasure to find some chocolates on our table at breakfast, as the 23rd was Easter. On our next stay in Florence, we will surely go back.

<Content>Florence This was a wonderful hotel ideally located in between the Duomo and the L' Accademia. The room was very spacious and super clean. The bathroom was a little small but that is probably normal in the area. The experience was wonderful and the staff was very helpful in providing tips and booking tours and getting tickets for museums for us so we didn't have to wait on line. The cappuccinos at breakfast were also really good!

<Content>Great Value, Location, and Very Helpful Hotel Columba turned out perfect for our family of 3: we had a large, clean room and stayed for 9 nights. We never felt claustrophobic.Breakfasts were fine- offering standard continental fare. All of us eat differently in the morning, and the combination of cereals, yogurt, fruit and rolls and cheese and prosciutto served all of our needs and were delicious. And our hosts served any hot beverages you wanted, along with great juices.Its location was excellent- close to the markets of San Lorenzo and the train station, it is also only a block an a half from the Duomo, the Accademia, and San Marco. Via Cavour is a fairly commercial street, but the rooms were very quiet.We were a little concerned that the prices, less than half that of the corporate owned hotels, implied a lower quality experience, but this was not the case. Although this is not a luxury hotel with lots of frills and many staff members, Hotel Columba was a great family run hotel which made our entire family feel very comfortable and supported in our first long trip in Italy. With the dollar so weak right now, everything is extremely expensive in Florence. We were very happy with the choice we made and felt that Hotel Columba offered great value for the money.But the greatest value was all the assistance, advice, and suggestions offered by Roseanna and her family members along with Sabine. Until we felt settled, they were more than willing to make restaurant and taxi reservations, etc. They were always eager to answer the million questions we had. They sent us to good shops to buy chocolates for people at home where the prices were better. It truly was like visiting friends overseas.

<Content>Outstanding Hotel Florence Italy - Hotel Colomba My husband and I were in Firenze January 2008 and stayed at Hotel Colomba. Have been to Italy, and to Florence, many times but can truthfully we have never stayed at a more pleasant hotel. The location is fabulous, and the owners and staff are absolutely wonderful. We had a very comfortable, lovely room, and the breakfast was marvelous.Will be returning in December, and most certainly will stay at Hotel Colomba. They make you feel at home.

<Content>Like staying at a relative's home. The hotel colomba is truly a home away from home. From the moment you walk thru the doors of this family run establishment, you feel as though you are walking into a private home of a dear friend or relative.The atmosphere and decor is warm. The rooms are well equiped and have ample storage. Sky satellite TV in every room keeps you well informed of news at home and abroad.Breakfast included in room rate, is served in a bright dining area with friendly hostess service by owner and Sabina.The owners(wife speaks flawless English) are always ready to engage in conversation or convey information about a particular activity or tour in the city.The staff, in particular Sabina, were helpful to the point of serving up a family cold remedie recipe to my wife and I, who were in need of some TLC tender loving care- it worked too. You almost felt like you were in grandma's kitchen. The Colomba Hotel occupies the second floor of a former Palace. Elevator service provides welcome relief for luggage toting travellers. There is a museum on the main floor.The proximity of the hotel to Florence's world renowned Duoma Cathedral, the Gallery Accademia, home of Michelangelo's David, and the Uffizzi Gallery, are all within 5-10 walking minutes -without getting lost.(so comforting)Highly recommended hotel and a wonderful experience.Brian and Paulette from Canada

<Content>Great Hospitality, Great Location Hotel Columba is a great little hotel in Florence, very close to the Duomo and the main train station. It's located on the 2nd floor of a building, and was admittedly slightly difficult to find at night.The pros: 1) Location, Location, Location2) The hosts...were fabulous and even invited us to have dinner with the family! They were very good with dinner recommendations, printing train schedules, opening our wine, etc...nothing was too much trouble for them!3) The bathroom was quite nice for an Italian bathroom. The shower was spacious and although the water pressure wasn't great, there was plenty of hot water!4) The breakfast was quite good and included in the room rate. Cereal, yogurt, fruit, meats and cheeses, pastries, etc....and fresh cappucinos and lattes made to order...take advantage of this since eating in Florence is pretty pricey.The cons:1) While I am used to hard beds in Europe, this one was extremely hard, and the sheets were quite scratchy, although I forgave this when I found out that all the sheets are dried by hand!2) The noise. Unfortunately, the walls are quite thin and you could hear noise until at least 11pm each night. If you are a light sleeper, take note of this.Overall, I would definately recommend this for people who like a very central location with great helpful hosts!

<Content>Hard to Fault We recently stayed at the Hotel Colomba in Florence. Traveling with two teenage children throughout Italy, it was difficult to find genuine Quad rooms that were beyond cramming 2 bunk beds into a standard room; however we found the Quad room at the Hotel Colomba to be a spacious and comfortable room. The service offered by Rosanna and her team was great and the advice given on Florence was valuable. The breakfast was very good and they also provided access to the internet which our children loved.The genuine hospitality, convenient location and the standard of the room made this stay the best of out 6 weeks in Italy.

<Content>Best value in florence This was our third stay at the Colomba in 17 years and it it just gets better every time. The hotel has been refurbished so that the bedrooms, bathrooms, breakfast rooms are spacious, clean, comfortable and represent excellent value for a 3 star hotel. The breakfast is great and cappucinos just kept on appearing at our table. The location is convenient as it is only 5 minutes to the Duomo, markets, major museums and galleries and only slightly further to the train station, Ponte Vecchio, Palazzo Vecchio and much, much more. Last but certainly not least, the hosts, Rosanna and Micele are just wonderful people. They went out of their way to assist us and did so with a genuine smile. I cant wait to visit Florence again and when I do I know the accommodation is taken care of!

<Content>Just like home I have stayed a number of times at Hotel Colomba. It is clean, safe, very central and Rosanna, her family and the rest of the staff are wonderful. It feels like a little bit of Aussie in the middle of Italy. The rooms are large and airy and the bathrooms are huge (certainly compared to other hotels in Italy)! The breakfast was amazing- a great way to fill up for a busy day sight seeing. I have recommended Hotel Colomba a number of times to family and friends visiting Florence. It is perfect for all travellers from singles to families and honeymooners. It is well priced and that makes it convenient as well as value for money. I will always stay there when I visit Florence. There is just no other choice!

<Content>Geat little place My family had a wonderful time in Florence and staying at Hotel Colomba made the experience even sweeter. It is conveniently located to almost everything. We just walked everywhere.The room for 4 is big and clean. The breakfast is deliciously enjoyable; the best we had in our 2 week tour of italy and Rosanna and her team is the best. She made us feel so welcome from the moment we set foot into this homely hotel. Yes, the hotel is on the second floor and lift a little small but you will soon overlook these once you settle in at this great little place.

<Content>Home away from home After the hustle and bustle of other cities and hotels in Europe, our stay for 8 nights with the Hotel Colomba was relaxing and welcoming. Rosanna, Michaela and Sabina provide excellent and warm service to complement the hotel's central position to the train and bus stations, Duomo, Uffizi, Piazza Santa Croce, Galleria Accadamie, laundry services etc etc and Marios' lunch restaurant. We enjoyed all the hotel's facilities - particularly the hot showers with great pressure, free internet access, books in all languages and fabulous breakfast (especially those who hanker for real expresso coffee in the morning). It has been a highlight of our seven week vacation and is highly recommended. Enjoy!Judith and Danielle, Sydney, Australia.

<Content>Larger than expected We stayed two nights in total and were pleasantly surprised when we saw the size of the room. We had booked a double and there were two beds...one of which was a queen (maybe king?) size. A nice surprise. The bathroom was a little tinier, but certainly not horrible.We did struggle to find the hotel, however. We had written the directions to walk from the train station because it seemed close. The roads in Florence apparently change names every block, so it required us to ask a lot of questions. But the walk back to the train station was much easier!The hotel was centrally located, the staff was really friendly, and the Duomo was also nearby. I would definitely stay again.

<Content>Great location and hotel! My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Colomba for a couple of nights in October. We loved it. Rosanna and her family were very helpful and accommodating. They held our bags for the entire day after we had checked out, which was great. Breakfast was very good every morning and they offer free internet on a public computer. We had a delightful time staying here.

<Content>Second stay, it's okay. I stayed here in 2004 and again recently (2007). I was in and out of Florence three times in a week and a half this time staying at three different hotels. While this hotel is clean and spacious, the staff always helpful, and the location is very central I was bothered by three (maybe small) things. The overhead light is fluorescent and gives the room a very cold feeling. The towels are paper thin by design, clean and fresh, but more like a kitchen towel than a soft bath towel. Lastly one or more of the family smokes, they live in the hotel and use the common room as their tv or livingroom. While I never saw anyone smoking the smell lingers even at breakfast. I know the family looks at tripadvisor, they had it open often on their computer clicking through the pages. I think these are three very easy fixes that would make the hotel warmer and smoke odor free.They did have the biggest shower of my stay and the room was spacious. The bed was fine. They breakfast is nice. The location is very central. The family is very, very helpful. The value for what you get is appropriate.

<Content>The Colomba experience The location of the Hotel was fabulous for our needs. The room size was good and the facilities in the room were quite modern. Rosannna could not be more accomodating to all our needs and I would say her level of service was 5 star. If you want to stay in the heart of Firenze this is just a terrific place.

<Content>Very nice place to stay We just returned from our trip to Italy and we highly recommend the Hotel Colomba. It is ideally located to visit the many sights of Florence and the hotel is clean and comfortable but above all is the hospitality that Rosanna offered was exceptional. She made sure our accomodations were to our liking and offered our small group the use of her breakfast room for a dinner one night. She also made an earlier breakfast the next morning for our group so we would beable to meet our tour guide. Her family made us feel very comfortable and welcomed.

<Content>Great accomodation in the hearth of Florence Hotel Colomba is a family run hotel, is located in the elegant Via Cavour few minutes walk from the Duomo and from San Lorenzo.We were 2 adults and 2 childs, had a room with 2 singles and a double bed, the room was great, large and comfortable, very clean and with new furniture;the price included a good quality breakfast.The owners were always ready to help and give suggestions.Surely if we go back to Florence we will book again at Colomba.Serafino Colosimo

<Content>Great location and value I stayed at the Hotel Columba with a friend in October and we had a terrific experience with Rosanna and Michel, who own and run the Hotel. They welcomed us early on the day of arrival and they assisted us with maps and suggestions for obtaining tickets to museums. The hotel location is excellent for many sights and markets within Florence. The morning breakfast was perfect for getting the day started in their cozy breakfast room. Rosanna treats everyone like a guest in her home and the value can not be beat. I would highly recommend the Hotel Columbo to couples, friends, and families visiting Florence.

<Content>OK for a short stay. Clean,comfortable and in a good position relative to the main tourist attractions.The proprietress was extremely helpful.Breakfast was adequate although a little repetitve and unimaginative.The only negative was the room allocation. It was small ,no natural light,no view,the smallest tv set I have ever encountered perched on top of the wardrobe and quite unwatchable.The room was adjacent to the breakfast area and the noise,particularly from metal chairs being dragged across tile floors from 8a.m. was intolerable making a lie in after that time impossible.As I did not check-in until around 10p.m the previous evening I was unaware of these shortcomings until the following day by which time it was too late to request a room change.From a study of the floor plan there were many more rooms in better positions and I would recommend potential guests to request a room away from the breakfast area .Pricewise room rates are reasonable.

<Content>the privacy of a hotel with the comfort  Excellent service by Rosanna and the entire Colomba family.This hotel offers the comfort of a BB with the privacy of a hotel.The owners live on site and are always around to help with anything you may need. It has clean rooms, a nice breakfast with boiled eggs, prosciutto, pastries, yogurt, juices and cappucino. Rosanna  her family personally welcome you to their hotel. There is a separate area to hold luggage that has a bathroom w/ shower to use for extended stay at the hotel if you need before or after check in times. The location is PERFECT for seeing all the sights in Florence. This has got to be the BEST value in Florence!

<Content>Great family run hotel Very friendly hosts. Great location, very easy to get to the sights - we walked everywhere. The room was clean, quiet and the bed was huge and very comfortable. There was a very nice trattoria just around the corner, and a great little club with live bands just a block away. We had an excellent stay in Florence, and would definitely stay at the Hotel Colomba again. Note for future visitors to Florence - book the galleries and museum trips beforehand as the queues were 2+ hrs even in October.

<Content>Fantastic! PLEASE don't be put off by the entrance to this fantastic little hotel. Once upstairs (by lift) you will receive the warmest of greetings by the family. Rooms are large, clean and comfortable. The beds are the equal of any 5* hotel. Breakfast is really great with the best coffee (Expresso etc). Had to see a chiropractor (hurt myself lifting our suitcases into the Italian Trains) and the owner, Rosanna went out of her way to find an English speaking one for me. Near all the sites you will want to see in Florence. Highly recommended!

<Content>A Very Happy Hotel A wonderful locaton, 1/2 block from David in the Accademia (3 min walk max) a straight walk 2 blocks from Duomo (4 min walk) and straight on to the Uffizi (8 min walk). Very clean accomadation, beds good slept all night no problems. Rosa makes the place she booked all the things we needed for no charge and goes well beyond anything I have come across before, you name she sorts it out for you, cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

<Content>Like Home All the previous reviews are true. The hotel is centrally located, has a wonderful continental breakfast and clean, good sized rooms but the main asset is Rosanna. You feel like you have a family member from Florence. She'll not only help you enjoy your trip by assisting with any of your questions or needs, she makes you feel at home!

<Content>Oasis in the City What a relief to check into to this highly clean, quiet, and conveniently located hotel after a long trip from California to Florence. This family-owned property meant caring support and help throughout our time there. The breakfast was lovely, and included cappucinos, lattes, etc. Having free internet access during our stay was a real help in letting the folks back home know we'd arrived safely. I would stay here again anytime.

<Content>Wonderful hotel in Florence I booked this hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. My family of three was not disappointed. We were forewarned by other reviews that the ground floor entrance was not beautiful, but the hotel itself is lovely. The rooms were spacious, well maintained , meticulously clean, beds very comfortable, great air conditioning , a perfect location in the center of Florence...and at a great price! The hotel owners are extremely gracious and helpful and the free internet is a bonus. Breakfast was fine as well...European style. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for nice accomodations at a reasonable price point. If you are looking for 5 star opulence then this hotel is not for you. My family is picky about accomodations and we were extremely pleased with our choice of Hotel Colomba.

<Content>A Home Away From Home My family and I ( husband and two children ages 12 and 10) spent 6 wonderful days in Florence from the 19th to the 25th of this month. The service was excellent ( no request was too big or too small) and we would not hesitate to recommend it to future travelers. For guests who do not have the luxury of speaking Italian staying in a hotel where you could ask questions in English was very benefiial. The room whilst having basic furnishings was more than adequate- especially when one considers the prices of other hotels in Florence as well as the length of time you really spend in your room ( too many things to do and see so you never are really there). The location was superb - close to the bus and train as well as the major attractions. The breakfast in the morning was an added benefit and it was nice to feel like you had personalized service.We chose this hotel primarily because of the service element and were in no way let down. Only one suggestion to future travelers - if you come by train into the SMN train station - whilst it is 5 minutes away if the streets are clear and you know where you are going we would suggest that if you have luggage take a taxi rather than attempting to walk. Thank you for a wonderful experience. We all rubbed the hog's nose so now we have to return!

<Content>Hotel Colomba was wonderful! Did a two-week European whirlwind tour this summer with wife and three kids (16, 12, and 8). The Hotel Colomba made our two nights in Florence wonderful. The rooms were very nice, very clean...my wife and two daughters were in the suite, which was spacious and comfortable. My oldest daughter also appreciated the easy Internet access. Absolutely no complaints, and if we come back to Florence, this is where we'll stay!

<Content>rosanna is a gen My family and I only stayed one night, but I can tell you it made no difference as to the Hospitality that we received. Rosanna could not do enough for us and we wish we could have stayed longer. Only one suggestion when trying to locate this hotel, look up. It is on the second floor, but the room was large and we were quite pleased.

<Content>Central location We have just returned from a trip to Italy which included four days in Florence before moving on to Lake Garda. We flew to Verona and took the train to Florence and from the station the Hotel Columba is about a ten to fifteen minute walk (when you are pulling suitcases along crowded, rough pavements!). The entrance lobby at street level leading to a small caf茅 and museum is very dark and there is a tiny lift 鈥?you can just about get two adults and two suitcases in - up to the second floor where the hotel reception is located. We were warmly greeted by Rosanna and shown to our room which was right beside the reception desk. We were warned that it could be a little noisy but we weren鈥檛 disturbed too much. The room was a good size with air conditioning and a small balcony (the view nothing to write home about though). The breakfast was OK. For a city centre location, the hotel was excellent value. We were a little disappointed by Florence, it was very crowded, queues everywhere, few trees, in fact a little claustrophobic. However, I can recommend the market close by the hotel which has some great leather bargains 鈥?be prepared to bargain, and the open top city tour bus which has two routes, both of which are good value, be careful though where you choose to change buses from one route to another, if you miss a connection you can wait quite some time. We wanted to visit the Boboli Gardens but unfortunately it was closed because a recent storm had brought some trees down and two other gardens we looked for, one was private, the other was locked! If you visit Florence for its art as I accept most people do, then as others have said book in advance for the well known galleries or you could spend a considerable part of your holiday in a queue roasting in the sun or getting a soaking from the heavy showers!

<Content>Simple, clean, and extremely friendly This hotel is very simple (no fancy furnishings or big bathrooms), but it is excellent. Its clean. There's FREE INTERNET. But above all, the propietors are very very helpful. Rosana, was a gem. She helped me call places, gave me recommendations, helped with bags, the works. It was a great value hotel for people on a budget. I would highly recommend this place.

<Content>Great 3 star family run hotel My fiance and I traveled through Itlay through July 6th to July 24th (Rome, Cinque Terre, Florence, Venice, Capri. We stayed one night in the hotel. It is in the center of Florence and a good value for the money. The breakfast is international and good. The rooms are huge and very clean. Our bathroom was a little small and the squared toilette seats were a little weird. But it might have been just our room. It is absolutely worth the money. Stay here if you are in Florence for a few days and a little bit on a budget.

<Content>Fantastico! I stayed at the Colomba for two nights in July with six other guests, two adults and four teen-age girls. I cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay. Signora Rosanna and Signor Michele made sure everything was perfect and it sure was. The two rooms that we had were spotless and the bathrooms sparkled. We had a delicious breakfast every morning, with high quality items, like the fresh pastries and excellent juice selection. The location of this quaint hotel is fantastic, just a short walk to the Duomo, the San Lorenzo market and the Uffizi. The Accademia is just behind the corner from the hotel.The proprietors had a few dinner recommendations and we enjoyed dinner at the San Zenobi and the Grillo Parlante restaurants (just behind another corner of the hotel). But the best part was our lunches, travelling with a group of seven people, we usually purchased deli meats, cheeses and breads from a local store. Signora Rosanna, gave us the use of her facilities for our sandwich making, and a place for us to have our lunches in her breakfast room. It made our lives a lot easier and the hotel owners went well beyond what was expected of them.I am Italian and I stayed at many other places in Italy and I can assure that you are not going to find a better deal for the money other than at La Colomba.I know that we will return. Grazie Rosanna and Michele!

<Content>Great! Very family friendly! Perfect Location! The Hotel Colomba is the perfect little hotel in the heart of Florence. The owners were very friendly and so helpful, it really made our stay. We were so pleased to have a quiet, air conditioned room with wireless internet in the heart of Florence. We had all of the conveniences that we could have wanted and when we stepped out the door, we were in the heart of the city. We have spent three weeks travelling around Italy and France with two very young children and this was absolutely the best place that we stayed. Thanks to Rosanne and Michael from Maurizio and family! Highly recommended!

<Content>Excellent Hotel - Location, Room, Staff all great I stayed at Hotel Colomba for 3 nights at the beginning of August in 2007 with my girlfriend and we both loved it. The hotel is a very good location, easily walkable from the train station. Our room was very nice, the room was a very good size and it was very clean. We had a nice size bathroom and shower, wifi, mini fridge and tv.The hotel staff was very helpful, providing maps and directions to all the sights and was always a friendly sight upon our return from sightseeing.The location of this hotel is very good, minutes to the Duomo and minutes to all the othre great sights. We walked from our rooms to everything, had no need for taxi, bus, etc.The breakfast was good, a mix of breads, cereals, eggs, yogurts, ham, cheese etc. They also make individual drinks (cappucino, espresso, coffee, tea) for everyone during breakfast.Next time I am in Florence, I know where I will stay.

<Content>Evviva la Colomba ! To find a quadruple room in Florence is not an easy task in the first place. We arrived at Colomba and found an hotel far above our expectations! Not only the location is perfect. This is a family with serviceinstincts beyond anything one can dream of; from serving us an extra early wonderful breakfast ( due to an early morning flight) to mailing us our forgotten keys,wallet and stuff to Sweden! The fantastic Rosanna would not even accept us to pay for package and postage!Throughout the years we have stayed at various places in Florence but this surely beats them all!Vi saremo sempre grati!!Martin Andersson, Pia Svorono, Fabio + Gabriele.Sweden

<Content>Hotel and Rosanna were Wonderful After arriving in Italy and walking from the train station (which is only about 10 minutes) we arrived in front of Hotel Colomba. This is a GREAT location, only about 5 minutes walk to the Duomo and Uffizi. Lots of great tourist shopping around the area. My son and I stayed at this hotel when we first arrived in Italy. I can tell you the warm welcome was wonderful after 5 stressful days of traveling and other terrible hotels. Rooms are much bigger and cleaner than any that we had previously stayed at, and some were $500 per night. When I asked Rosanna if she knew of someplace close by where I could buy something she immediately went into her personal quarters and brought me the item I was going to go buy, at no charge. I was so happy to have booked this hotel. The breakfast is more substantial then any other hotel in Italy (or all of Europe for that matter) that we stayed. Even though we only stayed one night we were very comfortable and happy. Thank you for making the start of our Italy segment at wonderful one.

<Content>A Great Find! Florence is an expensive city. Hotel Colomba is a family-owned hotel not with sophisticated furniture, but with all the confort needed to a pleasant stay. The breakfast was the best we had in Italy and included, the internet is free and they have wi-fi connection. Our room was very comfortable, with all amenities - the had supplied a baby cot. There is a private garage nearby the hotel and they take and bring the car for you. The hotel is in the second floor, but they help you with the luggage. The family, specially Rosana are very helpful and very polite. They gave us all the tricks to explore the city with a special advantage: The hotel is about 10-15 minutes by walking to all Florence's highlights! Don't miss the Central Market in Florence and to try a restaurant called Zaza, which is outside the Market!

<Content>I would certainly return Never have I found a hotel staff as accomodating as the staff at Colomba. They could not have been friendlier and more helpful. The hotel rooms were clean and spacious. The hotel is on the second floor of an older building that is right in the heart of Firenze. It is just down the street from the Duomo. Breakfast was much better than average. I would certainly return

<Content>A little gem I enjoyed my stay in this excellent hotel with my 21 year old daughter recently. We were very impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the proprietors. On our arrival we were presented with a map of Florence and the major tourist attractions as well as the location of good restaurants were pointed out to us. The bedroom and en-suite bathroom were spacious,clean and nicely decorated. A nice buffet breakfast was provided. Hotel Colomba is located in the heart of Florence, within walking distance of the train station, important sights and beside shops and the San Lorenzo market.If you are looking for a very good hotel in Florence with a friendly atmosphere then Hotel Colomba is a little gem.Catherine Buckley, Ireland

<Content>Dorm Life revisted Stayed there for one night. Very bland room with uncomfortable bed. Smelled of smoke. Breakfast was not great but okay. Entrance to hotel is on second floor and not well lit at night. It was overpriced. It reminded my husband of college life in a dorm.

<Content>Great Price and Hospitable Hosts The hosts were so nice and helpful, they spoke perfect english and the rooms were very spacious and clean. The hotel is a block away from the Duomo and just a couple minutes from the train station.

<Content>Great Place This is a family-run place in the heart of Florence. As you walk out the front door, 100 metres to your left is a McDonald's, and 100 metres to your right is the Palazzo Medici Riccardi, built in the 1400's by the powerful Medici family. What more could you want? The hotel is actually all on the floor above street level. We had a corner room at the back, which was so quiet I thought I was in a morgue. The bathroom was a bit small, definitely not for someone 6 feet 4 or obese. But it was fine for us. The wife in the family is Australian and extremely personable and helpful. The continental breakfast was also quite good, especially the Bravo Multivitamin fruit juice and the cappuccino. The internet (in the hallway) was free, and we had little problem getting access to it. Just remember that Florence/Firenze is considered one of the most expensive places in Europe.

<Content>Wonderful Place To Stay I booked this hotel for the Florence segment of our Italy vacation based on TripAdvisor feedback, and am thrilled that we did. Our experience with the Hotel Colomba was nothing but positive.The hotel is kept very clean. Our rooms (by European standards) were large. The breakfast buffet was ample. And the hotel is centrally located, making it easy to get to all the local attractions.In addition, Rosanna and her family went out of their way to be helpful and accomodating- with directions, suggestions for restaurants, sites to visit, things to avoid - and anything else we needed. We actually felt like we were staying in their home.

<Content>Excellent value, but ask for a quiet room The location of this hotel is very good, just a 5-10 minute walk to the duomo and other main sites. The previous reviews are true, the entrance and tiny, functional lift are a bit off-putting when you first arrive, but I think this is quite common in Florence. Rosanna was very welcoming and helped us arrange car-parking when we arrived.We were given room 6 which is directly behind reception, but after one night asked to be transferred to another room as we didn't get any sleep (Rosanna dealt with this request with no problem at all). Having the reception right outside the door, and also the lounge and dining room in the next room, meant that bells, buzzers and people were making noise until late into the night. Then we were woken up at 5 am by a radio alarm going off every 10 minutes, very loudly. After an hour I went outside to investigate and found someone sleeping on a camp bed in reception, possibly the owners' son or someone working there. Then we were disturbed by the sound of breakfast being set out! In summary, unless you sleep very soundly, ask for a room well away from reception! The second room we were given was smaller (although plenty big enough), and like the first was very clean, with excellent air-conditioning, satellite TV (with a good choice of channels), a good mini-bar (in which the drinks are actually cheaper than buying them elsewhere), and a hairdryer. The bed was very firm. The bathroom was small but spotlessly clean, with ample supplies of soap, toiletries and toilet paper. The room was certainly a lot quieter than the first one, although the staff start work in the corridors quite early, which woke us up most mornings. At least this was at a more reasonable hour, so we didn't mind!We asked for restaurant recommendations and were directed to two verygood places near the hotel, which we returned to each night. I strongly recommend following their suggestions, as there are a lot of highly-priced tourist traps in Florence.We investigated several hotels recommended by Tripadvisor, and found this to be the cheapest central hotel by far. This, together with the outstanding cleanliness, the excellent facilities and the friendly owners, makes this an excellent choice and very good value for money. Just make sure you request a quiet room!

<Content>Value for Money Hotel Colomba This family hotel is very well run. The room and en-suite very clean. Towels crisp. Breakfast room very tidy. Breakfast is very extensive. The family is always on hand to give advices and recommend suitable places to eat (in our case both recommendations have proved to be excellent). If you have forgotten to obtain Uffizi tickets on the internet Rosanna happily arranges it for you. Additional big bonus is that the hotel is only about 3-6 minutes away from all the major sight attractions. For the price one pays one cannot go wrong. Well worth it!!

<Content>not a good entrance, but actually very good for money Booked this on Internet, after consulting TRIPADVISOR. Hotel is on second floor of a building (as are many hotels), no more than ten minutes from the Cathedral, and the city centre. The entrance to Columba is pretty awful, as is the tiny lift to the second floor. Rosanna or one of her family greet you warmly, and u walk down a narrow passage to your room. Rooms are not huge but absolutely spotless, with great air-con. Sheets changed every day. Breakfast great, and Rosanna  family very helpful with everything. FREE Internet, which is most unusual in my experience.

<Content>Great place to stay in Florence Hotel Colomba was a great place to stay in Florence. The room was fine - we had a quad, and there was plenty of space for us. Bathroom was just fine, also. The room had a stocked refrigerator, and the items were reasonably priced. The couple who own the hotel were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was the best that we had on our trip to Italy - several kinds of breads and pastries, cereal and milk, yogurt, hot beverages, eggs, cheese and proscuitti. There was a small elevator, which helped with getting luggage upstairs. The hotel also offerered free internet service, which was very useful. We had to leave early, before breakfast, so they did not charge us for the items we had used from the in-room refrigerator, and still asked if we wanted to take something from the breakfast room. The hotel is very conveniently located - we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>U.S. amenities! Wonderful hotel!! The location is outstanding. You can walk to all the main attractions, and David is almost close enough to climb in your window! We spent 3 weeks in Italy,and this was my son's favorite hotel of the entire trip.We had a true triple room with remote-control in-room air conditioning and wireless Internet in the room.Such amenities aren't easy to find in Italy,and we really enjoyed having them.Breakfast here was also our best in the country.Don't be frightened by the building's outer appearance-it's a downtown building in an ancient European city.Also nearby is i'Toscano,a very reasonable restaurant with some dishes in lighter sauces than many Italian locations. Thanks for a great experience in a very relaxed city. John Huffman,Battleboro,NC,USA

<Content>recommend for value and convenience We used this hotel as a base location for 5 days in Tuscany. This hotel is an excellent value based on location, cleanliness, and friendly staff. The hotel is similar to a mid-line bed and breakfast of the type in North America. Less than 20 rooms, all of good size with modern bathrooms. The room we got was extremely quiet at night, though a couple of rooms may be located on the street. (And I do mean quiet, we never heard a thing.)After daily excursions on buses and trains, we always looked forward to a good and quiet night's sleep at the hotel.The hotel owner is always present and more than helpful in giving recommendations. Free website/internet access is provided -- I never thought I would use a computer on vacation but it came in handy when we had to look up schedules or email back home.Highly recommended. New arrivals to the hotel may be put off by the informal entrance and the courtyard view of laundry, but that is typical. We had 5 days with no surprises and great service.

<Content>Great service! My wife and I were in Florence for a week and selected the Columba on the basis of the reviews provided here. Overall I think the reviews posted here for the Columba are accurate and representative of our experience.Plus:Convenient location -- near sites, central station, and on bus routeOutstanding service -- helpful in learning our way aroundLarge, clean roomsComfortableVery friendlyMinus:Nothing major. I think any minor issues we had were more likely due to the differences between US and European customs and standards.

<Content>Nice, simple and friendly My wife and I arrived in Florence, from Venice, by hired car and driver. The hotel is on one floor of a 5 or 6 story building. We were met at check in by the older middle aged couple who own this family run hotel. It would be hard to find a more guest friendly place to stay. The hotel had the feel of a boarding house. Rooms were simple and clean. A modest breakfast buffet was included and it was very good. The location, 2 blocks from the Duomo (step out of the hotel, turn right, and there it is), justified the $200 per night charge. If you don't need fancy, this is a fine place to stay. We would stay there again.

<Content>Friendly, warm and superbly located We stayed three nights at Hotel Colomba and would highly recommend it to anyone. Rosanna and her family were always available and helpful without being intrusive. Our room (with air conditioning) was very clean with comfortable beds and a wonderful shower. Continental breakfasts were generous, delicious and so easy to grab before we headed out the door for a full day of touring. Located just minutes from all the famous sights of Florence, Hotel Colomba has varied room sizes so they can accommodate families. We'll definitely be bringing our kids back here!

<Content>great stay My husband and I stayed at Hotel Colomba for 3 nights in April. The location is very convenient to Florence attractions. Our room was large, on an upper floor where street noise was not a problem. The staff was extremely helpful with directions and booking a tour for us. Breakfast consisted of cereal, pastries, yogurt, etc., and great coffee. We were very please with our stay here. 135 euros per night, booked directly through the hotel.

<Content>Great place to stay. We have just had the pleasure of a stay at Hotel Colomba in Florence, Italy. This hotel is family run, small and friendly. The service is marvellous, nothing is too much trouble for the Italian/Australian who runs this establishment. The hotel is situated at 21 Via Cavour, second floor (there is an elevator). Via Cavour is a busy street, but inside your hotel room you hear no noise. It is conveniently located to museums and galleries such as Academia (Michelangelo鈥檚 David), Uffizi, Palazzo Pitti, Bargello Museum (in one room, four Michelangelo sculptures, many sculptures by Cellini, and upstairs, Donatello, Ghiberti and many others). The Duomo is about five minutes walk in one direction, with Piazza San Marco about the same distance in the other direction. Ponte Vecchio is a ten minute walk from the hotel.Our hotel room was spacious, comfortable, clean, well appointed, with an individual air conditioning unit that you set to your own requirements. Beds were comfortable and the bathroom shower had a powerful flow of water, this we found to be quite unusual in Italy. There is free internet usage, with access to a computer in a common area. If you have your own laptop you can pick up WIFI in your room at no cost to you. This was an incredible advantage for us.There is an excellent buffet breakfast included in the cost of your room, juice, cereals, yoghurt, bread rolls, pastries, prosciutto, cheese, eggs, fresh fruit, jams etc. Great coffee, made to order. This hotel is outstanding value.

<Content>Very friendly place! Excellent. Small and tidy family run hotel in excellent location (just a few minutes walk from all the main Florence attractions). Spacy , fresh and clean rooms (we've arrived there straight from Rome's Turner Hotel which - in comparison - was a bit claustrophobic). Very supportive and friendly staff. Very nice and quiet stay. Great value for money!

<Content>Small family hotel Stayed at Colomba for three nights with my family (4). Room was large and very clean. Our hosts were wonderful. Very helpful and spoke english. We had a room on the street and liked to watch the action on the street. Yes it was noisy and needed to be closed at night but didn't bother us. Great location, down the street from the Duomo and Accademia. Used the laudromat and supermarket nearby. The Colomba has basic furnishings and is not fancy. If you are looking for a clean pleasant hotel in a convenient location it is for you.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed at the Colomba for one week after reading reviews. The hotel lived up to expectations. It was clean, we had comfortable beds, and breakfast was good. The owners were more than happy to provide info on how to get to places etc. The Colomba is situated in just the right spot for visiting all the attractions in Florence.Florence itself has plenty to offer and Siena is def worth a visit for a day.We will certainly return to Florence and would stay at the Colomba again.

<Content>Comfortable Stay. Our stay at the hotel colomba was our first experience staying away from a hotel chain and in a small family-run place and we found both positives and negatives.The positives were the friendliness and attention of the hosts, rosanna and her husband and also the great location. The room was very large, and certainly quite clean.On the down side, due to the large size of the room, it was difficult for the small radiant heater to heat the room and we were quite cold. We asked for a second heater, but they didnt have one and gave us an extra blanket instead.The other negative for us was the towels - rather than fluffy towels, they were quite thin waffle towels, and not as comfortable to use.Breakfast was simple but good, certainly adequate and lovely cappucinos to order.Again on the positives - on the last day we had some trouble with our credit card, and rosanna allowed us to use her phone without charge to sort out the problem. I suspect we wouldn't have received the same degree of help in a larger chain-hotel.So overall, pluses and minuses, but a comfortable place to stay.

<Content>great location but get a rear room or else the hotel was located in a great location, espicially when one needs a midday break. the breakfast was ok. the room was clean and spacious for 4 people.BUT if you cannot get a gurantee of a room away from the street, the street noise and the lack of fresh air ( with the window open it sounds like you are next to a major street- which you are) may prove to be a bit disruptive. I also thought, looking back on the trip, that it was a tad high in price in comparison to other places we stayed

<Content>Home from home Just back from Florence and wanted to write and say how much we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Colomba. Rossi and family made us feel so welcome and as we were travelling with our 3 month old daughter they could not have been more helpful.Rooms are comfortable size with nice beds and clean cot provided. Showers nice with shampoo and even toothbrush provided. Easy location in the centre of Florence near train station, Duomo, Accademia and Uffizi. Perfect for business holiday combinations.Would recommend to anybody as friendly city centre hotels are a find indeed. Thank you to the family for a great experience.

<Content>Just perfect We have just returned from a trip to Europe - mostly Italy. We stayed at several 3 or 4 star hotels during our holiday and this one stood out as our best experience.Hotel Colomba had been recommended to us by several friends who had stayed there before. It was highly recommended and we were not disappointed.The hospitality was absolutely the best we experienced anywhere during our four weeks in Europe - not intrusive but always available to help or advise. Rosanna, the host, has perfect English having studied and taught English and Italian in Australia.The rooms were substantial with all we could want. Well equipped and absoluetly clean.Breakfast was buffet style with a great choice to suit all tastes and appetites. The location was ideal - just a short stroll down the road from the Duomo, close to the major attractions, the markets and the station.We appreciated the free access to the internet.We will certanly go back - and recommend it to our friends.

<Content>Unbeatable value! My husband and I stayed at this hotel in November last year and it was by far, the best valued hotel on our trip throughout Italy. Our room was quite big in comparison to other places we had stayed at, as was the bathroom, especially the shower stall. Beds were comfortable and clean.Breakfast was the best, lots of variety and everything was fresh.Free access to the internet was a godsend, and the hotel's location was excellent - within walking distance to everywhere. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Good choice We stayed Jan 12  13 2007 and booked the hotel based on the reviews up until Dec 2006. It was a GREAT choice and expertly described by AnnMarie56, Boston on jan 7th. The fact that Rosanna is from ADELAIDE S. Aus. (my hometown) was a surprise and the best part of the visit but we didn't let it influence our opinion of the hotel (still it sure was nice to be able to speak English due to our ignorance of Italian).It WAS all of the things that everybody else has mentioned...clean, comfortable (spacious!), quiet, yummy breakfast, close to everything, walking distance from train station (urgh wheeling suitcases over cobbled streets should be an olypmic sport!).We liked the market area in behind the hotel - the restaurant Za Za was good and we ate at the indoor market at a place called Nerbone that was pretty authentic and good given that we managed to NOT order tripe.There were no lineups to see David (sat 9.00 a.m.) or the Ufizzi so that made our trip even better since we were only there for one full day so am assuming it is a good time to visit Florence.There maybe other nice hotels in Florence but it doesn't matter anymore - Hotel Columba has me forever.Ciaojill (exaussie)

<Content>Best Buy in Florence The Hotel Colomba is a gracious jewel in the heart of Florence. The location, just a few steps from the Duomo and the San Lorenzo Mercato, could not be better for sightseeing, shopping, dining, and, well, just everything! The prices were very reasonable and the comfortable accommodations and gracious services were worth every penny. The family and owners of Hotel Colomba, Michele and Rosanna, were the most gracious and helpful hoteliers that we have had during four trips to Tuscany in the past six years.The hotel is central to everything, the rooms are clean, quiet, with comfy beds and perfect linens that are changed every day. There is a sizable mini bar fridge and a television with great reception in the bedroom. The bathrooms were spic and span clean, with lots and lots of hot water available for showers, which is rare in Italy. There is a hairdryer, a comfort pak, and many fresh towels in the bath. (You will not find face clothes in any hotel in Italy. We found that packing one or two in our bags took care of our needs.) The rooms are simple in design, with the objective being comfort. The bedrooms are very comfortable and most of the furniture is new and similar to Ikea's modern design. The floors are old, marble, and dust free. Everything a visitor needs is in the room. If you need something special, ask Rosanna and she will get it for you! She takes care of her guests, 24/7!The best windows available in Italy have recently been installed throughout the hotel, and are effective in shutting out noise, and keeping in warmth or cool air, depending on the season. There is self controlled heat for the winter and during the summer, remote controlled air conditioning. Everything in the hotel is well maintained and in great shape.  The breakfast room is like the rest of the hotel, clean and warm, with Rosanna and her assistant greeting everyone with a cheery Buon Giorno and Hello! The breakfast buffet was plentiful. A banquet of fresh foods awaited us every morning. A huge tiered basket with a variety of fresh  firm fruits, 3 types of cereal, freshly boiled warm eggs, crisp toasts, many fresh pastries, italian croissants, four types of fresh cheese, freshly sliced proscuitto, jams  jellies, two types of juices, and the best cafe  cappucino in Florence! We have stayed at 4 and 5 star hotels in Florence and this was the best breakfast offering to date. Rosanna is fluent in Italian and English and understood our American nuances and inflections when we were speaking with her. She should be wearing a concierge insignia, the crossed keys, on her shirt lapel as she, her husband and sons, accommodated and anticipated every need and whim that we had during our stay, including access to a dentist for my broken tooth! Thanks to Rosanna's efforts, we were able to pre-book museums and dinners at our favorite restaurants several weeks before we arrived in Florence. Michele and Rosanna's sons are very gracious young men who also speak english, one more fluently than the other. We met them as they both work at the hotel, greeting and taking care of the guests. Michele, a native of Florence, is a sweetheart and accomodated every one of our many requests with the grace of a legendary Italian gentleman. Michele and Rosanna thought of everything to make their hotel and our visit to Florence warm, enjoyable and comfortable! An added bonus was use of a computer with free internet and WiFi access! The large wooden doors to the building automatically close in the late evening. Michele opens them for you when you ring the buzzer to the right of the door frame. The hotel locks its doors at 1:30AM, which was not a problem for our jet lagged family of four.The neat thing about the hotel is that there is a bus stop at street level, but the sounds of the centrally located street do not reach the hotel. There is a small elevator on the ground floor of the building, which manages to fit 3 guests or 2 people and many large suitcases or bags at one time! It is a quick ride up to the second floor, where the hotel is located.There is a small cafe, Michelangelo's, on the ground floor of the building that houses the hotel and another 25 yards up the street, where you can nip in for a snack. Rosanna also serves guests espresso  cappucino, as well as liquors at the bar for an afternoon or evening treat. The prices are listed on the wall above the expresso bar.The staff of the hotel can order a taxi for you, and will give you a confirmation receipt that lists the name and number of the taxi, and the expected arrival time at the hotel. You merely ask Michele for a taxi, get the receipt and take the lift to the street to your taxi. We found that during our stay, we did not need to stay at the 5 star hotel on the Arno, with a marble tub in the bathroom, Frette linens on the beds, and copies of famous paintings on the walls, for four times the cost of staying at the Hotel Colomba. We were as comfortable and well taken care of during our wonderful stay with Michele, Rosanna and their family, as we would have been had we returned to the five star hotel.We are looking forward to our next stay at the Hotel Colomba!

<Content>A Great Hotel My wife and I booked this hotel based on the great reviews from other trip advisor members. All the great reviews are true! The rooms are spacious and the location cant be beat! Plus they have free internet, that was definately a big plus in my book! When we come back to Florence I will definately be booking another room at the Hotel Colomba!

<Content>Wonderful quiet reasonably-priced hotel in the middle of everything! We are so happy with the Colomba! The owner, Roseanna, lived in Australia for many years and speaks perfect English. Her Italian husband also speaks good English and both are very friendly, helpful, and nice. Our room is large and spotlessly clean. The breakfast buffet is wonderful. There's a library of books and magazines you can read. Since it's off-season, we were given an excellent rate. The hotel is right in the middle of the historic area where we want to be. The rooms are quiet and well-heated and they give you soaps, shampoos, etc. plus there's a little refrigerator and safe in the room (and a bidet). There's even extra wool blankets if you want them. And free use of their computer and the internet. Overall, this has been a great place to stay in Florence!

<Content>Jewel of a hotel This is a jewel of a hotel and spectacular value smack in the middle of Florence - midway between the Duomo and Piazza San Marco and one block from the Accademia. Plus free internet access! You can find fancier and certainly much more expensive hotels, but you won't find better value than Hotel Colomba or a more charming host than Roseanna, who speaks fluent English with an Australian accent. Book directly via email or phone.

<Content>Very friendly city centre pensione I stayed here recently with my wife and some friends. Hotel Colomba is a family-run pensione on the second floor of a building very close to the Cathedral. The staff were very helpful and welcoming, and we really enjoyed our stay with them. Rooms were spacious and clean, bathroom facilities were good, breakfast was very good, the location is excellent (15 mins walk to train/bus station; 2 mins walk from Duomo; 1 min from tourist information office) and I would definitely recommend this place. Though located on Via Cavour, there was no traffic noise at all (the rooms are at the rear) and we slept very soundly.There is a lift in this building, but it is small (3 persons max, or 2 with baggage). This is not really a problem, except for disabled travellers.Overall, we enjoyed this place. Expect a warm welcome from Rosanna and her staff.

<Content>We keep coming back Our recent trip to Florence was again enhanced by staying at this wonderful, centrally located hotel. The refurbished rooms are excellent and the delicious coffee and breakfasts ensured a good start to our day. As always, the family who run the hotel went out of their way to help us, particularly Rosanna for whom nothing seems to be too much trouble. I am delighted to recommend Hotel Columba.

<Content>Wonderful We stayed at Hotel Columba in the first week of November. We knew this was a family run hotel and knew that it was not a luxury accommodation. We arrived there early morning and our room was not ready. We were very early and didn't expect our room to be ready for a while. Rosanna took our luggage and let us rest in a very nice sitting area. Within an hour of our arrival our room was ready! It was a very nice and CLEAN room and attached washroom. Very very big and spacious for Europe standards. It was in front of the reception and we had heard it could get noisy, but we really wanted to check in and rest. I have to say, we stayed there for 5 nights and only were disturbed by a little bit of noise on the last night. The rest of the time, we didn't even notice that we were in front of the reception. Rosanna and her family were wonderful to us and always made us feel welcome. Something you don't get at many of the 'big' hotels. They also had free internet access and an area with lots of books and magazines. Overall a very nicely organized hotel. The breakfast was wonderful as well. The hotel staff was always very very pleasant. If you are looking for a great location close to everything, clean and spacious room at a very very reasonable rate, this is the place to stay. I would go back if I ever visit Florence again. Thank you Rosanna, family and staff. You made our experience very memorable.

<Content>Wouldn't go back Stayed here for 3 nights in September - we were given a room on the 3rd floor, one floor up from the rest of the rooms which we accessed through a fire door then walked through what was, in fact, somebody's sitting room where a teenager was studying a lot of the time then into our room. We found this bizarre.The hotel was fine, nothing special. The shower in the bathroom was pretty bad. Breakfast wasn't up to much either.The staff were friendly enough and the location was good but I wouldn't be rushing back, we found it a bit odd overall.

<Content>Friendly, convenient, and clean! We just returned from a family trip to Italy (Rome and Florence) and are happy to report that our accomodations in Florence were great. Hotel Columba is conveniently located near some of the most popular sites in Florence (the Duomo, San Lorenzo Market, Ponte Vecchio, and great little restaurants). The staff were very friendly and helpful. Rosanna (our main contact) was happy to do whatever we needed, including reserving times at museums, a taxi for our return to the airport, or the afternoon cappucino that we needed. Our room was a nice size and very, very clean. The bathroom (small by our American standard) was adequate and very clean. Another nice part about the room is that it opened on to the courtyard and was pleasantly quiet. Breakfast was typical Italian, simple, fresh and tasty. You could see the effort that the staff made to insure that our needs were met. We are very satisfied with our experience at Hotel Colomba and would recommend it for anyone.

<Content>Went above and beyond I echo all the positive comments about great location, cleanliness of room, good breakfast, very helpful hosts, reasonable prices, etc. Additionally Rosanne went above and beyond for us. My husband and I had to leave very early in the morning to catch the first train. In our haste, I left my wedding band in our room. Rosanne contacted us as soon as it was found and she mailed it back to me in the US! While it was only a plain silver band, it certainly has tremendous sentimental value. I doubt that another more corporate hotel chain would have troubled themselves. I would highly recommend this family-run hotel.

<Content>Dingy rooms, great location We were moved to this hotel when the hotel we booked gave away our reservation. We were very disappointed to see the Hotel Colomba as it is very dingy looking, with small bathroom, older looking furniture and tiny lobby. It looked and felt like a dorm room. They even lock up the entrance after 1:30 AM! Luckily we were in by then but what would one do? Our room was directly opposite the front desk about 2 feet from it - which actually felt like an intrusion on our privacy. the room was large and had one double and one single bed (we were two sisters) and was the largest we had in Italy. But there were no rugs and the room felt cold. The bathroom reminded me of those on cruise ships - very tiny - but sufficient. The owner was pleasant and the breakfast was OK. But this hotel lacks any kind of charm. The entrance was awful - you have to go up to the second floor in the tinist elevator ever made, I think. Great location, one block from the Accademia for David and couple of block to the Duomo.

<Content>Comfortable place; good location This hotel is comfortable for European standards and very clean. The location is great, and the staff was very helpful. Breakfast was yummy, and the coffee fantastic. I thought the price was a little high for what you get, but it seems that the prices were high all around Firenze.

<Content>We could not fault the Colomba! We travelled to Florence for a weekend break. The flight went smoothly, we got a great, chatty taxi driver and the weather was glorious.Rosanna and her husband who own the Colomba are lovely and as Rosanna spent some time in Australia, her English is brilliant for all us lazy Brits who don;t speak Italian. The Colomba is on the 2nd floor of a palace building about 300 yards from Il Duomo and only about 10 minutes from the railway station. There is also a bus stops ritght outside goes to the station or up to Fiesole.The lift is bijou! 3 people max or 2 and their cases - just. But it works perfectly well.The rooms are large with air con, fabulous shower in the big bathroom, enormous 6' wide very comfortable bed, wardrobe and lots of drawer space, safe, fridge with mini-bar, and a window looking out over a series of gardens, yards and courtyards. They don't ring the Duomo bells at night but they are lovely to hear in the morning.Nothing was too much trouble for the staff or Rosanna, free internet! Borrow an iron and board, no problem, a map? recommedndation for a restaurant? museum reservations? (Do this in advance of arrival through Rosanna)Breakfast, coffee or tea any way up, fruit juices, cereals, cold meats cheeses, breads, jams, honey. Boiled eggs, everything you could wish for.Actually, I am almost reluctant to recommend the Colomba because they may not have space for us when we go back!!Thank you Rosanna and everyone for giving us such a happy stay.

<Content>Disappointed When we arrived, Rosana told us she overbooked and we had to stay at another hotel. She booked us in a 2 star hotel that charged the same price as Hotel Colomba (3 star hotel). I was very disappointed that we got bumped, especially since the reviews on Tripadvisor were so high, and that I was going to be paying the same price for a 2 star hotel. I had alot of options when deciding where I was going to stay in Florence. One of the main reasons I decided to make reservations at Hotel Colomba was b/c of the reviews on Tripadvisor. Furthermore, I made the room reservations through Hotel Colomba's website, not through another 3rd party website, so I don't think there are any excuses. I just wanted to let travellers know that it is possible to get bumped from this hotel.

<Content>Great Deal in Florence We stayed a few night at Hotel Colomba. It is in a great location for a easy walk to most of the major sites. The city of Florence is not too big. The hotel is on a busy street, but inside the room it was quiet. Rosana, the woman who runs the hotel speaks perfect English and is most helpful. She made reservations for the Uffizi and Accademia before we arrived which is the only way to visit these sites. The room was very clean and a nice size for Europe. There are a couple of markets in the neighborhood to pick up some snacks and drinks. For a real treat visit Palazzo Medici at Via Cavour 3. It is not packed with tourists and just down the street from the hotel. You do have to climb some stairs to get to the 2nd floor where the hotel is located. There is an elevator, but it is tiny. The breakfast was nice with lots of choices. The free use of the computer in the hallway made it easy to send e-mails back home. All in all we loved our visit to the beautiful city of Florence!

<Content>A Very Happy Landing Colomba was an excellent base from which to see Florence. It's also close to the main market in Florence - a great place to pick up some lunch items rather than eating in cafes all the time. The hotel was very comfortable and very clean. All of the staff were friendly and helped us in so many ways. Breakfast was plentiful with fresh pastries, fruit, cereal, and basically anything that one could come to expect. My only comment would be that our room looked out into a courtyard through which ran what must have been the exhaust pipe from the local kebab restaurant. A little noisy with the windows open and a constant smell of cooking meat. This room not recommended for vegetarians.Kebabs were good by the way though there's a better place just up the road.

<Content>Excellent choice Centrally located, reasonably priced (for Firenze), and super friendly staff. The breakfasts were plentiful, the rooms huge, and the air conditioning luxurious. But by far what made our stay here stand out was the way that Rosana, who lived in Australia for many years, went out of her way to help us. She was always willing to give us some advice or discuss any issue, and she knows Florence like the back of her hand. No qualms at all about recommending this place.

<Content>Perfect location Agree with other reviews. Ideal location, very friendly and helpful staff and owners and all within a stone's throw of the major sites.Hotel arranged car parking at 23 Euros a day which worked a treat. This was after we had parked at the station for 42 hours and paid 127 Euros!!! Avoid this mistake at all costs as it will end up costing more for the car to stay in Florence than for you to stay!

<Content>Great central position Colomba hotel is in a great central position within walking distance to all the major sites. The rooms are clean and quiet. This hotel is run by a very friendly family which made us feel very welcome, they speak excellent English and are very helpful. Would definately come back and stay here again. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location, Fantastic service What a wonderful little hotel just minutes away from the Duomo, Accademia and Uffizi. We were pleased with the spacious, super clean rooms (all of which have remote control air conditioning that kept the rooms comfortable) and excellent service that Rosanna and her family provided (not to mention the nonexistant language barrier, thanks to Rosanna's perfect english!). The breakfast was great (meats, cheese, yogurt, fresh pastries, cereal, cappuccino, etc), there's a comfy sitting area with books and a computer with internet access for guests. My next trip to Florence will be spent at the Colomba...I wouldn't consider staying elsewhere!

<Content>Absolutely wonderful! I can't recommend this place enough! If you're looking for something that's centrally located and run by extremely gracious and generous hosts, this is the place! Michele and Rosana continually went above and beyond the call of duty for us. It felt more like we were staying with friends than in a hotel. Whatever we needed, our hosts made it their mission to help us out. When it looked like my girlfriend would be unable to travel by train, Rosana broke out a map and started charting our route to Cinque Terre. When we asked for a restaurant recommendation, she sent us to a wonderful, family -run restaurant that served us the best lunch we had in all of Italy. I can't remember all the nice things she and her husband did for us, but I do remember feeling that I was making a pest of myself, constantly asking for recommendations or advice. Without fail, she and Michele (not sure if I'm spelling that right) graciously answered our questions, never once making me feel like I'd made a pest of myself. There were seven of us in my group, and we all found our accomodations to our liking. We had one quad and one triple. The rooms are clean and tidy, the hotel nice and quiet. Never did we feel cramped, nor did we hear even a peep from any of our neighbors. The beds were quite comfortable, and the pillows were perfect. The staff of the hotel are all pleasant and friendly. Breakfast filled our bellies each morning, and espresso/cappucino was available for the asking. I know this much...if I ever go back to Florence, I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else.

<Content>Great Location Small family run hotel in an excellent location, within walking distance of many of the major attractions. We were three ladies sharing a triple room which was a good size compared to many other European Hotels. Staff were very friendly, English speaking and helpful in their advice of places to visit etc. Typical continental breakfast and plenty of it. I would have no hesitation in recommending it to the independant traveller.

<Content>Nice, small hotel My family and I stayed at the Colomba on 6 and 7 Aug, 2006. As a family of 4 we appreciated the very large, but somewhat spartan, room with comfortable beds and a high-capacity, quiet air conditioner. Even though our room faced the street it was extremely quiet with the window closed. Maintainence of the room was excellent. The family running the hotel made us quite welcome. Breakfast was nothing special but was certainly adequate. The hotel location enabled us to walk to the most interesting parts of Florence in minutes. We would definitely return to the Hotel Colomba.Thanks to the other TripAdvisor reviewers -- it's because of you that I chose this and other hotels on my 2 week trip to Europe.

<Content>Fantastic Small Hotel This really is a fantastic, family run hotel. It is spotlessly clean and is run by the most charming and helpful people imaginable. We stayed there in August 2006 and were very happy.When you arive at this hotel please don't be put off by the slightly strange entrance and lift. Once you are on the second floor of the building and in the hotel itself you will realise that this hotel is really nice. It is friendly, has spotless rooms and an intimate bar and breakfast room. It is in a very good location and only about 5 minutes walk from San Marco, the Duomo and San Lorenzo - dead central. It is on a busy street but we could not hear traffic noise at all from the room.The staff speak good english and put themselves out to be helpful and pleasant.Very good value for money and a very good experience. Highly recommended - we would certainly go back there again.

<Content>Return visit to the Colomba Two years after a first visit (and the first review written about the Colomba) we returned for an overnight, before flights out of town. As 4 adult women (mother, daughter, two friends), we had a quad room, which was plenty spacious for us. Once again, the Colomba was very clean and all was as I had remembered. It is a very well-run small family hotel that enjoys a great location and exceptional customer service. Roseanne was very accommodating, making dinner reservations at a small local restaurant and arranging the cab and wakeup call for our very early departure to the airport the next morning. It is easy to recommend this hotel and I'm glad that the Colomba is enjoying a well-deserved high ranking.

<Content>Home away from home I was surprisingly pleased at this hotel. The rooms are comfortable, clean and very spacious, unlike other hotels I have stayed in Italy. I particularly was touched by the owners of the hotel, who treated us as a part of one large family. The hotel is centrally located within walking distance to the Duomo, the Accademia Museum , and the Pietre Dure Museum. In fact, it was within walking distance for just about anything I needed, including a laundromat! I certainly highly recommend a visit here, as I will be a returning client.

<Content>Nice Hotel. Hotel was clean and room was spacious. The washroom was very small. Service was nice. Staff was friendly and helpful when needed. Rosanne was very nice to our children and also provided them with a small gift which made them very happy. Breakfast was good and sufficient. Hotel was in an excellent location very close to Duomo and walking distance from the train station.

<Content>Nice Hotel My wife and I stayed at the Colomba Hotel for 10 days and found it to be one of the best 3 star hotels we have seen. It is nicely located to all museums and tourists sites. The rooms are large and clean with working AC and large bathrooms. The breakfast consisted of eggs, meat, fruit, various yogurts/ cereals and wonderful coffee. Best of all the rooms were quiet. Rosanna and her husband assisted us in getting reservations for critical museums and worked to make our stay a pleasant one. Cheers to Rosanna et al.

<Content>Like Staying with Family My husband and I stayed at the Colomba in mid-May for four nights and very much enjoyed it. The hotel is extremely well-situated - close to all the major sights, as well as many restaurants and bars. The family that runs the hotel welcomes you like a long lost relative and makes you feel at home. The rooms, while not luxurious, were very clean and quiet and the breakfasts were ample with fantastic coffee every morning. There was no shortage of anything!I highly recommend the Hotel Colomba for anyone looking for a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere in the middle of Florence.

<Content>Worthy of the Praise All we can do is echo the praise that other reviewers have bestowed upon this wonderful oasis. What an endearing spot! We felt welcome from the moment we arrived via the tiny elevator until the time of our all too soon departure. The other reviews accurately describe the warm and friendly atmosphere of this gem. We would stay at the Colomba again in a heartbeat and strongly encourage all to do the same.

<Content>Hotel Colomba - Best Florence Hotel We are a family of three and stayed at Hotel Colomba for five nights. We did a lot hotel research prior to our trip, but did not book our tickets until three weeks before. We were not sure what to expect, but were very pleasently surprised with Colomba. In short, this is the best hotel available in Florence that has the complete package, including a great price (most hotels around the area are much more expensive and have the same amenities), amazing location, very friendly and helpful staff and clean, modern rooms that still maintain the quaint feel of Florence. Location - less then five minutes walk from the Duomo, Accademia and Medici Ricardo Palace (right between the two main artistic and historical attractions of Florence), on the main street in Florence that leads to all the other main attractions like the Duomo, Palazzo Vecchio, the Ufizzi Gallery. Bank and ATM, bus stop and several restaurants rigth downstairs. right accross the street, and the Leonardo DaVinci museum on the bottom floor. Hotel - very clean and very modern rooms. Bathroom shower is amazing. There is also a free computer and internet access for use to anyone in the hotel... great if you do not want to spend your money at the internet cafes around town. There is an all-you-can eat breakfast every morning, that has everything from proschiutto and eggs to yogurt and cheese. Of course, my very favorite part of breakfast is the most delicious cappucino ever. Breakfast is included in the price too. Colomba is owned and run by a wonderful Italian family, and I noticed others have posted their pictures - fluent in English and very helpful and friendly. Rooms are air conditioned by remote control, and have ample storage. We were three people in one triple and had more then enough room to store our luggage and shopping (which by the way, consider to leave much extra space for your return home :). In addition, the hotel became to us much more like a home then a hotel. You will see the hallways filled with light and the pictures of Florence on the walls, with a little library and sitting chairs, all give Colomba a very friendly atmosphere.We highly recommend staying at Colomba!!! Our favorite hotel in Florence, we would certainly return here if we could.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend. The owners were delightful and very helpful. It is in a great location, very close to the Duermo and a great price. I will definitely be staying here again the next time I get to visit Florence. The rooms were simple and clean and the free breakfast was delicious!

<Content>This Hotel is Perfect This wonderful hotel was an answer to our prayers. We had been staying in a fourth floor walk-up apartment in Florence with our two grandchildren, and our granddaughter who has juvenile diabetes, went into insulin shock early one morning. We had no phone, no one to contact, and we speak very little Italian. We did get an ambulance summoned, she was taken to hospital, and was stabilized. I knew we would not go back to the isolation of the apartment, so my husband and grandson went knocking on doors to find a hotel nearby. They found the Hotel Colomba which was close to the hospital and we spent one night there before continuing on to Venice. The hotel was perfect. Very clean, large rooms, many ammenities not usually found in European hotels. Rosanna and her husband were very understanding of our situation and made us feel very secure and assured us we could call on them if another emergency arose. ( It didn't and our granddaughter had fully recovered by the next morning). The breakfast was the best we had in Italy, as was the cappacino. The location is perfect too--close to everything. If we ever return to Florence, we will certainly stay there, and we have recommended it to several friends and will continue to do so. It is a excellent family hotel.

<Content>Absolutely wonderful!!!!!!!! The Hotel Columba was a joy to stay at. It was wonderful being at a hotel that was family owned. Roseanne and her family along with her staff were just fantastic. Location was great, nice sized clean rooms, my friends and I could not complain about anything except our stay in Florence went by too fast. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and cannot give it enough praise.

<Content>The Best Three Star Aboslutely perfect in every way, clean, great rooms, great breakfast. Walking distance to all of Florence. The owners are very well versed and provide great advice on food, shopping and the best things to see if you have limited time. They are the kind of people you would invite to stay at your house. A fun and confortable place to stay. Bill Breecher Phoenix, Arizona

<Content>The Best! This hotel was so nice, so clean, so close to everything and we loved it here. We were three girls on holiday, so the big spacious room was great for us. Roseanne and her husband and family could not be more gracious and helpful. Breakfast was a good verity and the cappuccino was top notch too. Roseanne got us a wonderful English speaking private driver to take us all over Tuscany for one whole beautiful last day in Italy. PERFECT!!

<Content>Loved this hotel Just returned from a stay the Hotel Colomba and it was great! You absolutely cannot beat the location, within walking distance of most major sites, and sits on a main street with lots of buses. The room was really clean, and surprisingly quiet at night. The best part has to be the family that runs this hotel. The wife, Roseanne lived up to her reputation; she could not have been more welcoming, cheerful, or helpful. She helped us with tickets, directions, and great restaurant suggestions. The free internet access was also a nice touch.

<Content>Loved Colomba hotel The hotel is very well located : 5 mins walking from Duomo and other famous places however the place is comparatevely quiet. We had a large room, very clean and comfortable. The breakfast was good and sufficient. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Rosanne (the hotel owner) and her husband are very pleasant and nice people and the whole atmosphere of the hotel was just great! We'll recommend this hotel to our friends.

<Content>Friendly Family run Hotel Central location close to everything. Literally steps from the Duomo and around the corner from David. Large rooms with AC, clean bathrooms, and a friendly host. Fresh cappicino in the mornings and a lounge to hang out in the evening. Free internet access is always a plus. Absolutely the best place to stay for the price!!!

<Content>Excellent location and great value overall! We stayed at the Hotel Colomba for 3 nights recently. The location was fantastic -- literally walking distance to the Duomo , Accademia, Medici Palace and many of the major sites, shops and restaurants. The room and entire hotel was super clean, almost a little sterile feeling (the floors are uncarpeted and minimal funishings in the room). Aside from that, the staff is fantastic and Roseanna and team would go above and beyond to answer our questions and help us out. Overall, it is a fantastic value and I would highly recommend it!

<Content>Comfortable and Clean A clean and comfortable hotel, that put us up for 1 night when our original hotel down the block had plumbing problems. We were treated very well - room was large with exterior balcony that looked into other buildings. The owners were very nice. The hotel is walking distance to train and very central the all major city sites. Recommended.

<Content>very nice place to stay We stayed for one night at this family driven hotel and were very satisfied. Rossana stayed on the phone with us until we found the street where it was located, we got a little lost. She is such a nice lady the hotel is very very clean the rooms are very comfortable the shower is nice and breakfast was great and it is true what they say about her cappuccinos they are the best, and most important very close to all the important sights. I would highly recommend this property.

<Content>Fabulous in Florence After jumping off the train and strolling past the Duomo in central Florence you arrive at the Hotel Colomba within a few short minutes. Set on the second floor (with the option of a lift) away from any street noise, you are greeted by the friendly English speaking staff of this family-run hotel. As a guest you will enjoy a bright and excepionally clean room with comfortable bedding, a clean bathroom, a wardrobe, safe and minibar. The TV selection offers both English and Italian programmnig, very useful for those who like to stay in touch. In the morning a generous breakfast is offered including assorted cereals, breads, pastries, cheeses, juices and a personal favourite...prosciutto! Another great feature for those far from home is the free internet access.Most importantly, the proximity of The Colomba means that all Florence has to offer is within a very short walking distance whether it be cultural, (credit) cardinal or culinary.

<Content>Highly recommend this for good value, comfort, and convenience My grown daughter and I stayed at this wonderful, small, second floor, family run hotel for six nights. It has an excellent location for sightseeing/shopping. The lift is tiny, but was adequate for us and our luggage. The owners/operators gave cheerful, helpful, and accurate information to our queries, gave good recommendations, and made our stay an especially pleasant one. Our room (#9) was spacious, immaculately clean, and quiet and dark enough for me (a light sleeper). The bathroom was newly updated and included a roomy shower. Breakfast consisted of breads, cheeses, yogurt, cereals, ham, hard-boiled eggs, juices, fruits, and coffee/tea/milk. Internet was available to guests. A clean, modern coin laundry was only a few blocks away.

<Content>Best 3 star ever We have stayed here for 8 nights in the perfect location to see all that Florence offers. The hotel is a quitet 15 room venue that offers extra friendly service, clean, good sized rooms with an excellent breakfast every day. The coffee, cup after cup, is superb. The hotel is on the second floor so is away from any street noise. You can walk to any of the most famous sights within minutes. It's near the train station where you can take day trips to anywhere in Italy. We will return.

<Content>Wonderful Family Run Hotel We stayed at the Columba for eleven nights in April and found it to be nearly perfect. The rooms are immense by Italy's standards and the bathrooms, while small, were clean and well equipped. Best of all, though, was the perfect Florence location just five minutes' walk from the Duomo. Despite the central location, our room looked out onto an interior courtyard and was very quiet. The English speaking owners of the hotel were full of local knowledge and were great resources for us on the trip. Unlike in so many Italian hotels where you are greeted with indifference or even rudeness, the Columba's employees were very friendly. We will most definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great stay at Hotel Colomba! Stayed in a triple room at Hotel Colomba for about 8 days in April 2006. Had no problem finding the hotel while walking from the train station. The hotel is in a great location less than 5 minutes from the Duomo, and about a 10 minute walk to the train station. The hotel staff was fantastic - everyone was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Rosanna, the manager, is great. She speaks perfect english and provided great advice. The staff really goes the extra mile to help make your stay a pleasant one. The size of the room was adequate, the bathroom small. It is not fancy room, but is was comfortable. The sheets were a nice - all cotton (I'm picky about my linens). The mattresses were firm (but more comfortable that the ones we slept on in our hotel in Rome). The elevator is pretty small, but worked fine. We asked for a room away from the street and were very pleased with how quiet it was - could not hear any street noise at all. The free internet access was very convenient. The computer was sometimes busy when we wanted to use it, but was then usually free if you came back 10 minutes later.Breakfast was very nice continental. Rosanna and her staff will keep you fully caffeinated with their complimentary espresso drinks. There a couple types of juices (not watered down Tang like in Rome), prociutto, several types of cheeses and cereals, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, whole fruits, and a couple types of breads.I highly recommend this hotel because great location, breakfast, and fantastic staff. It isn't the fanciest place around, but I will definitely plan to stay there again next time I visit Florence.

<Content>Good hotel, but quite expensive This is a good 3 star hotel, but I found it quite expensive. I'd normally expect to be paying about 拢60-拢70 per night for a 3 star hotel, but this one was over 拢100 (actually 150 euros per night for a double room for 2 people, booked through venere(-). Having said that, my impression is that this is a general theme around Florence, and all hotels seem to be similarly overpriced. Hotel Colomba is nice and clean, centrally located, the rooms are reasonably sized, the people at the reception are friendly and helpful, and there is a PC that offers free internet access for guests. One slight problem, our room was close to the reception, so there was some noise at night from people coming in / picking up their keys / phones ringing at the reception, etc. All in all, a good (but expensive) 3 star hotel, nothing more, nothing less.

<Content>Great Hotel in Florence The Colomba Hotel gave us one of the nicest stays we've ever had. The owners Michele and Rosanna are extremely warm and generous people who will help you with anything you need and make you feel at home. The rooms are clean and elegant, the location is terrific (2 min walk to the Duomo), and the atmosphere is wonderful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Florence, Rosanna speaks English, so it is especially a good choice for Americans/Canadians/British . . . Thanks to the owners' warm and caring manner, we had a terrific time

<Content>We enjoyed our stay at the Colomba We loved our stay at the Colomba. Our triple room was clean and spacious and had a fridge(useful for snacks etc), cable TV (with CNN and BBC)and free use of the internet(which our daughter made good use of including using MSN).The room was air conditioned so was very comfortable compared to other hotel rooms which we found rather cold. The hotel is on the second floor but there is a lift for luggage etc. Breakfasts were the best we had throughout Europe: cereals including muesli,fresh fruit, yogurt,pastries, cheese and hams,boiled eggs, toast, freshly made coffee and tea (even peppermint tea especially for our daughter.The location was outstanding:close to San Lorenzo, 10 minutes walk to Duomo, 5 minutes to see David. We walked everywhere.There is a bus stop just outside the hotel so if walking is a problem there is public transport close by. Roseanna the host is wonderful. She is Australian Italian and has a degree in classics so she was a font of knowedge in terms of various historical sites but she was also helpful in terms of shopping!All in all the hotel was a respite from the rigours of travel and we will be recommending the hotel to all our friends.In terms of value for money it was excellent!

<Content>great little hotel We had a great visit at this hotel. It is on a main road which was not noisy or too busy - we were there in March which is a nice quiet time to visit. Perfect central location near the Accademia, and easy walking distance from the train station and all the important sites. Nice size room, very clean and quiet. Only place we stayed on our trip that had a fridge in the room and CNN on the telly. Internet access was available and greatly appreciated. Great breakfast with the best cappuccino I had the whole trip. The hostess Rosanna even invited our Syracuse University son to come over for breakfast. Family run -Bed and breakfast comfy but hotel privacy. I'd like to give it 6 stars.

<Content>Nice Family Run, The Best Location Hotel Columba has a great location - a short walk to everything we wanted to see in a three day visit to Florence. The hotel owners are helpful and gracious, and we had interesting conversations in English. The breakfast was more complete than most and the Barista coffees kept coming. The rooms are well appointed with instant hot water. Our room was quiet with a charming Italian city view to the local homes. Also a free internet connection is available all day long. To visit all of the famous museums, church, shopping, and great restaurants the Hotel Columba is a very good choice.

<Content>Clean+, location++, Close Early- First, for those who stay out late at night, this place is not for you. They informed us when we arrived that they close the front desk, and lock the front door, at 1:30am. If you plan on staying out later than that, you may want to look somewhere else, or at least call to see if the policy has changed. The only other thing to note, is that this place is extremely hard to find. There is no big, or even small sign. The hotel is on one floor of a shopping building. I recommend taking with you a picture of the building off this site. The hotel is family owned and operated. They are all very nice. The rooms were indeed very clean, and very large for european standards. If you look at the pictures on orbitz, it is very accurate. These rooms are nothing fancy. It is not like they have a wealth of information and connections to get you what you want in the city, but they seem like they will try their best to help you out with finding what you are looking for.Now the positives, it is about 1.5 blocks from the duomo. Which was unbelievable. If you know florence, than you know that eveything for tourists is very close to each other. So being close to the duomo, means it is only another few blocks to the ufitzi, and the ponte de veccio. So location is great, there is no debating that. The elevator is small and questionable, it depends on your faith in technology. And as someones previous review pointed out, they do have a computer in one of the hallways, and it is free for all guests. Breakfast. It is free, and it is pleasant. (pastries and fresh juice).Like I mentioned before, this hotel was nothing fancy, but it was clean and pleasant. While this place might receive a 3 star if it were in a different city, I got the feeling there are much worse hotels around. The location, cleanliness, and friendliness raise this hotel to the Florence 4 star level. (look at the pictures on Obitz of this hotel - they are accurate in every way)

<Content>Great Family Hotel - Nice Location This has to be one of the better hotel values in Florence. Located on the 2nd floor, however there is access via small elevator. Room was very clean. We had a rather large room for European standards, with a double and single bed, plus a mini fridge. Shower was nice and hot; TV with CNN/BBC. Single computer down the hall has windows XP and free internet access. You can take a taxi from the train station, but we walked to the Colomba in about 10-15 minutes. Hotel is around the corner from the San Lorenzo market; two blocks from the Accademia; and a 5 minute walk to the doumo. Roseanna speaks excellent English and she and her family fun a great hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Staff !! Best hotel we experienced in Italy!! This is a fantastic hotel close to all of the major sights in Florence. Breakfasts were fantastic and the tips and advice from everyone at the hotel were excellent. Guests also have access to a PC with internet connectivity, which was incredibly useful for working out the next stages of our trip. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A great family stay Travelling with children is both fabulous but also, at times, difficult. This great family-owned and run pensione, right in the heart of Florence, was the perfect solution for us. A warm refuge from winter, a place to rest tired legs and a place to have a chat with Rosanna and Michele, their children or their friendly staff. La Colomba is so convenient, reasonably priced and very comfortable. The rooms are spotless and well-appointed with all facilities - minibar, safety deposit box, television, telephone and of course heating and air conditioning as required. There is quick and ready internet access, plenty of advice (in both English or Italian) and assistance when organising tours or anything you need help with in Florence. We always began the day with a delicious breakfast which kept us going for hours. We were amazed at the variety and quantity of dishes on offer - cereals, fruit, eggs, cheeses, meats, pastries, juices, lovely teas and of course coffee. There is always a warm or cool drink and chat available when you want it. I can highly recommend the Colomba for your stay in Florence.

<Content>Florences Best 3-Star Hotel! Hotel Colomba in Florence,Italy is a great Hotel!I've been going there for years and it's always terrific: Clean  Comfortable Rooms, Great Prices, Really good breakfast, and the Owners (Rosanna  Michael) are the Best! It's a great Family-Run Hotel. My wife  I started going there about 10 years ago, (when we were young, carefree, and just dating), now we are there once or twice a year with our little 5 year old daughter, and it always feels like coming home again.  The location is perfect, very central and close to everything (at Via Cavour, #21), right around the corner from the famous leather markets, and right in between the Doumo and the Gallery of the Academy (where the Statue of David is Located). But the best thing about Hotel Colomba is that everyone there works so hard to help you enjoy your trip: giving advice on where to have a great dinner to making reservations, or whatever else you may need. We've been referring friends and family there for years and everyone always loves it. Also Rosanna lived in Australia for years so her English is Perfect. It's a total Winner.I strongly recomend it!

Nice rooms, clean hotel, great location,  great price. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was great compared to other hotels that we had stayed at.

<Content>Great Location, Hotel Nothing Special Well I probably won't add much new to the reviews on this hotel. My impressions are as follows:1) Size: We had a HUGE room, larger than anywhere else we stayed in our 16 days in Italy. 2) Finish: The finish is dorm room at best. Nothing fancy here, but so what. It was clean and that is about the best I can say.3) Location: You really couldn't ask for much better. Very short walk to all the main attractions.4) Parking: Beware - they indicate that parking is available, but in reality it is not. We had to drive about 1.5 miles and park at a public parkade for $25 a day. Not the end of the world, but you should know in advance.5) Services: Internet is free but get in line! Once PC and it is popular so getting on is not easy. Breakfast is above average, and the owners are very nice and accommodating.6) Other: If you stay there ask for a room OFF the main street! I live in downtown Toronto (Canada). A very large, busy city, but the traffic from the street in this hotel kept me up most of the night!7) Final Thoughts: The hotel, on its own, would be no better than a 2. However, taking into account the price and te location, it is a 4 for Italy. Just do not expect anything fancy!

<Content>In the heart of the Reniassance What an experience to wake up in the heart of the Reniassance, realizing you are just meters from the Palace in which Michelangelo perfected his art and only meters away from the home of his greatest work of art (and the world's), Michelangelo's David. Hotel Colomba offers both the experience of living in the middle of this Reniassance city and the experience of geniune Italian hospitality from the Rossi family.

<Content>Fantastic I higly recommend The Hotel La Colomba. Located in the very heart of Florence with all the wonderful sights just minutes away, I was pleasantly surprised by the reasonable price of the room. I had expected to pay much more. I have one priority and that is cleanliness. This hotel was spotless! Rooms were cleaned every day and I found fresh white towels and toletries in the bathroom which was also spotlessly clean. The room was spacious and had all the comforts one could ask for: phone, TV, mini bar, safety deposit box, heating (there was also an airconditioning unit obviously for summer). There was also free internet access so I was able to keep in touch with my family without having to go to an Internet caffe which I hate. Breakfast was a veritable feast. There was no rationing of one tiny bread role and jam. You could select from a variety of cereals, fruit juices, ham, cheese, eggs, rolls (as many as you liked) jams, croissants, a variety of teas, cappuccino, hot chocolate, latte all freshly delivered to your table on request. I have stayed in many hotels in Italy and this is by far the most generous breakfast that I have ever experienced. Last but not least ... the staff. This is a family run hotel Rosanna and Michele (husband and wife) run La Colomba with the help of their two sons (when they are not at school). Rosanna is a gem. She speaks English, having lived in Adelaide, Australia for much of her early years. Nothing is a problem. She is a font of information and it is all delivered in English so you understand. She can answer all you questions: where to find a good restaurant, how to book for museum visits, where to shop, what busses and trains to catch if you want to go anywhere.... the list is endless. Rosanna is one of the most generous, friendly and accommodating people I have ever met. Michele, was always helpful and attentive and the two boys charming. The staff is wondeful and speaks English! Wow! I had a perfect stay. What a fantastic hotel and what lovely people!!!

<Content>Loved this jewel of a hotel My wife Elaine and I have just returned from five nights at this jewel of a hotel in a terrific location in Florence. We loved it 鈥?so much so that we stayed an extra night.The Colomba is a small, family-run hotel. Our room, a triple, was large, affordable, quiet, clean, very well-heated and extremely well-lit. The bathroom was a good size, if not large, and had nice modern fixtures; the water pressure was good, and the water hot. We enjoyed the breakfasts, and especially the terrific coffees prepared for us by Sabina and Rosanna. The rooms also have minibars, a nice touch for a small hotel, with the bottled water at the hotel cheaper than in the local coffee bars where one usually gets it.The location was remarkable. Situated on a main street, you exit the hotel to the left to find the Accademmia and Michelangelo鈥檚 David in about three blocks; to the right and the right again and you鈥檙e at the Basilica San Lorenzo and Brunelleschi鈥檚 Laurentian Library; or to the right and straight on a few blocks to the Duomo and the bell-tower. It鈥檚 the best location we鈥檝e ever been in for visiting sites in Florence. Some recent negative comments on the Colomba picked at specifics, but when booking a family-run hotel in Italy 鈥?or anywhere in Europe 鈥?you make choices. The water pressure at our Rome hotel was better than the Colomba, but the Colomba鈥檚 is quite good. By contrast, we struggled to read by our Rome hotel鈥檚 dim reading lights, while the Colomba uses high-watt bulbs that make this a non-issue. And while the Colomba breakfast had less variety than we found in Rome, it鈥檚 a smaller hotel. If you want everything to be perfect, spend a minimum of 50 percent more to stay in a name-brand hotel 鈥?losing all of the charm that comes with this family-run establishment when you do. It鈥檚 your choice. Heat was our number one priority, and we have stayed in some freezing cold Florence hotels; at the Colomba, we were warm and toasty in the cold November nights.Some thoughts on local opportunities:  -- To get the best rates at this hotel, book through their own web site, hotelcolomba dot com. Reservations through other booking sites can result in agent fees of at least ten percent that a place this small has to pass on, so be warned. -- If you鈥檙e used to eating on an American schedule, or just so jet-lagged you can鈥檛 wait for dinner to start at 7:00 p.m., try the restaurants on Via Borgo San Lorenzo a couple of blocks from the hotel. They are the only ones we could find anywhere that were serving dinner at 5:00 p.m. on our heathen American schedule. Giannino in San Lorenzo (especially the grilled meats) and Osteria dell鈥橝gnolo were two very good ones, with some very, very nice Super Tuscan wines on the menu.  -- Two doors down from the hotel, at Via Cavour 19, is a little wine store that sells discounted Super Tuscans. I brought home two bottles of the hard-to-find Castello Banfi Summus for a ridiculously low price.

<Content>Loved this family run hotel. Yes, it is a bit noisy but still worth the stay. The staff is extremely charming  helpful. Breakfast was the best I've had in Italy (made to order coffee, freshly sliced prosciutto, to die for brioches/ croissants, juice, cereal...) The free internet terminal and 3-4 minute proximity to the Duomo made this hotel very very convenient. We enjoyed an unusually large bathroom in our room, which might have been designed for a wheelchair user (though the hotel floor has steps, w/a narrow elevator, and is not wheelchair accessible.The hotel is slightly noisy in the morning due to hardwood flooring and poor soundproofing in general. In the morning you can hear people running around making breakfast. The maid was ironing sheets in the couch area next to our room. This didn't bother me because I don't sleep in during vacations. The room next to us was noisy one night so we asked the owner to speak to the guests, and all was well.Warning: Hotel door closes at 1:30am. So don't stay out pubbing (not that Florence has any pubs anyways.) Also, the elevator in the building is very narrow. So one person and one suitcase at a time please.

<Content>A Disappointment I selected this hotel based on the reviews and I must say that we were disappointed. We toured three different cities during our trip through Italy and this was our least favorite hotel. To begin with, we were given a room (very sterile in appearance) surrounded by the reception, lobby and kitchen. To their credit, it was quite large and a triple room given to us for the same price as a double. However, it was extremely noisy. We could hear everything, from conversations in the reception area to clanging dishes in the kitchen. We did not feel a sense of privacy with so much going on around us. Because the hotel was booked, we could not be moved to another room that evening, but staff was able to offer another room the next day. This room was substantially more quiet and still quite spacious for a double; however, I did not find it to be as clean as I had expected, given other reviews, and there were a few other problems (i.e., broken shower door, dingy blankets, lots of mosquitos). Aside from this, the hotel is in a great location and the breakfast was the best we had while staying in Italy. However, the remainder of our experience will probably keep us from staying there again.

<Content>Convenient location and friendly hosts We spent 6 nights at the Hotel Colomba while we were visiting our daughter, who is studying in Florence this semester. The owners, who speak English, are friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very good, with made-to-order capucinno and cafe latte available (as well as tea and a variety of juices). The food consisted of several types of cheese, ham, rolls and croissants, fruit, yogurt, cereal, and boiled eggs. It was more than adequate for us. The hotel is located on a fairly busy street, but our room was located at the back of the hotel, so we didn't hear any street noise. The hotel has tile floors, which may be typical, but they do tend to make the hallways a little noisier. The rooms and public spaces are very clean. The location is convenient, so we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. For the price, we were quite pleased with everything. My only complaint is that the smell of cigarettes was sometimes evident in the public part of the hotel, but it was just a minor annoyance, and everything else that we liked about the hotel out-weighed my aversion to the smell.

<Content>Very Friendly Family Owned Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Colomba for 3 nights. It was very pleasant and the owners of the hotel were very nice. The woman spoke English very well, which was great for us since we did not speak very much Italian. She was very helpful in many ways. We requested a personal driver to take us through Tuscany, and she and her husband called a friend who did this and set it all up for us. I also had a minor medical issue, and she was very helpful in getting a doctor to come to the hotel to help me out. When you are in a foreign country and do not know many things about it or the language, it is really great to have people who are willing to help you out. Also, the breakfasts every morning were very nice. It is a pleasant memory, and I will always remember the woman who owned the hotel helping me out when I really needed it.

<Content>within walking range Great little hotel, owners and staff so helpful, within sight of the Duomo and walking distance to all the other sights in Florence. Ten minutes walk from the train and bus stations.We had a large beautiful clean bedroom and so quite in the middle of Florence. Great breakfast.Would highly recommend it if your are looking for a good Bed and Breadfast hotel.

<Content>Friendly Hotel Colomba We stayed at the Hotel for 4 nights in two rooms. It is not a fancy hotel by any means, but so pleasant and friendly that we just loved it. The rooms are large and very clean. The breakfast was great. The bathrooms are small and the towels were not luxury but Rosanna and her family make you feel as if you are a guest at their home.

<Content>Hotel Colomba, a home away from home We have been traveling in Northern Italy for the past two and a half weeks and have had a wonderful time. Going to Florence has always been my dream. A friend recommended that we stay at the Hotel Colomba when in Florence, at Via Cavour 21. I'm so glad we took his advice. We have an excellent room - comfortable bed, clean modern bathroom and plenty of space and at a reasonable price compared with some of the other places we've stayed. It is also within easy walking distance to all major attractions. But most important the staff here are so helpful and friendly, willing to go the extra mile to make our stay a memorable one. Some speak excellent English which helps those of us who know very little Italian. The included breakfast is ample and offers a great selection. I'm so glad we took our friend's advice and chose the Holel Colomba.

<Content>I wouldn't stay here again I stayed here for three days and had a similar experience to the reviewer from San Jose. My first night was in a room just off the hotel reception and breakfast area. This was noisy due to the family watching a football match on TV, noise through thin walls from the adjacent rooms, and from general hotel comings and goings.For my second and third nights the proprietor kindly allowed me to move into a room on the floor above. This was much quieter and also much larger. There did seem to be some problem with the plumbing as it became very noisy at about 3AM one night and there was a bad smell in the bathroom.I didn't try the breakfast.In summary this is an OK place to stay if you have no alternative but I wouldn't build up high expectations based on the reviews here.

Thanks to all of the staff, when I come back to Florence I will make my reservation with you. Thank you again for a wonderful stay.

<Content>Less than perfect We stayed at Hotel Colomba the beginning of October for 3 nights. The owners and staff were very nice and tried to be accommodating. The hotel advertises itself as smoke free throughout but this is not true. The lobby and common area sitting room smelled terribly of cigarette smoke. Our first room was behind the reception desk and we could hear lots of hotel noise and smelled the smoke. We moved to another room for the remainder of our stay which was located on the second floor within the owners living quarters which was very odd. The plumbing in this room was bad, from low pressure (one day there was no water...in the middle of my shower) to the toilet tank that ran loudly for 15 minutes after flushing. The towels were very thin and non absorbent. The coffee at breakfast was good but the offerings were less than we experienced at other hotels we stayed at during our two weeks in Switzerland and Italy. We would not return to stay at the Hotel Colomba.

<Content>Now I know why the hotel is so high in popularity... This hotel was a great find. We're so glad we stayed at this hotel based on previous reviews. We loved how it was family run, they made you feel so well-taken care of. The hotel was in a good location, walking distance to everything we wanted to go. The breakfast was good. Overall, our stay was really nice. It's not luxurious but definitely a nice place to stay. We would stay at it again if the chance were rose.

<Content>Best Hotel in Florence This is my fifth visit to the Hotel Colomba, as usual it is a delight. The hotel is run well it is clean, the breakfast is great and the staff is friendly. The location is perfect, you can walk to the most important sights. I cannot consider visiting Florence and staying any other place. Also, as an added benifit, acess to a computer is free

<Content>A Place to stay This is certainly a place to stay when coming to Florence. Hotel Colomba is a family-owned hotel, it is very clean and the rooms are quite big, which in European Hotels is very hard to find. The owners are very friendly and cozy, they make you feel like home. The location of the hotel is really conviniet, you walk to the dome, the river, the ufizzi gallery and the academy gallery. We really had a great time and we recomend this hotel to everyone coming to Florence.Sergio Granados y Familia. Chihuahua, Mexico.

<Content>A gem in Florence We found this hotel by chance, and can't find a bad word to say about it. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the rooms were very comfortable.The owners were extremely friendly and helpful. The location could not be better and all attractions were within easy walking distance. We will definitely choose this hotel to stay in again when we next visit Florence.

<Content>Unexpected and Perfect Visit! My mom and I recently traveled to Florence (Firenze) spontaneously and had no place to stay. The owner of Hotel Columba was at the train station looking for customers and proceeded to tell us all about his hotel. We wanted something inexpensive and he gave us quite a deal, AND his hotel was in the very center of Florence, two minutes walk from the Duomo, ten minutes walk to the river, and in the midst of lots of shopping. We had a beautiful room, and breakfast was DELICIOUS! I've never had a better hotel breakfast, and they served us cappacinos and were always ready to help. It is a family-owned hotel and I had the greatest time. It wasn't fancy, but it was very well-kept, clean, friendly, convenient, and I had no complaints.

<Content>fantastic hotel- a must for anyone staying in Firenze My parents found this hotel when they used to visit every summer over 15 years ago, purely by chance.We were searching for a place to stay in the centre, and found this little hotel right in the heart of it all. We have stayed here every year since.The owners are warm and welcoming people who always have a moment to ask how our day was.We havent ever looked for another hotel since that first stay, and each member of our now grown up family has stayed with friends, on so many other occasions. Each year it just gets better, with more improvements and comforts.Its a real family run place, with Rosana and Michele at the helm. Whenever you need any information on whats going on in the city, either the time of the mass at the Duomo, or what medicine to buy if you have a cough, they help with pleasure.Rosana is an Australian so speaks English as her mother tongue, which is a real bonus for those who dont speak Italian. They cater for all sorts of tastes at breakfast, including my mother who is diabetic, Rosana always has sugar free jam for her!The location is really in the heart of it all, any closer and you would really be staying in the Duomo! The bars and resterants are all within 5 minutes walking, and each and every important artistic site is also within 5-10 mins walk.The rooms are always spotlessy clean, and have improved every year we have been coming. Now each room has its own private bathroom, and safe deposit box, and also its own bar and television with cnn, and bbc world, and misic channels all there.I cant fault this place- its a real gem- there isnt a better place to stay in Florence.

<Content>Made me feel at home This was the find of our trip to Italy. Well as far as accomadation went. The staff are friendly and will do anything for you. This is in stark contradiction to some of the very impersonalised service we recieved elsewhere. The location is walking distance from everything you want in Florence. Rosanna speaks perfect english having grown up in Australia and everyone else will make an effort. I dont bother writing reviews very often but felt compelled to on this occassion. Ciao.

<Content>Great Location for the Price My friends and I (3 young women) stayed at this hotel at the beginning of August. It is on the second floor of a building and really is in great walking distance to the markets, ice cream stores, restaurants, the duomo, uffizi, and the accademia. It is family owned. We felt very secure and safe here as well. Every morning there is free breakfast and very polite assistance. The wife of the hotel owner also speaks very good english. Free Internet is also provided which is great. It is reasonably priced for its location. It also has AC. It is a three star hotel. It was a very relaxing stay.

<Content>Clean and Convenient I used TripAdvisor as my guide when selecting a hotel for our recent trip to Italy. We were a family of three, mother and two teenager daughters, first time visitors to Italy, speaking no Italian. Hotel Colomba was a good pick. The room was clean and comfortable, and the location was great. Went to the market, the academia galleria, duomo, and many other sites, all within easy walking distance. Staff was not especially wonderful with us, and did not allow us to eat breakfast early on the morning we were off to the Duomo. However, this small, unpretentious hotel was a great find. A computer with internet hookup is available free of charge for guests, which my daughters especially appreciated.

<Content>A Fantastic Hotel in a Fantastic City Wow! I had such a wonderful stay at Hotel Colomba. The owners are very nice and they make you feel right at home. Its a beatiful hotel, very clean, and it makes you feel like you are really in Italy. The hotel is extremely close to the main tourist attractions. There is no need to use a bus. They have a breakfast every morning and they make wonderful espresso and cappucino. Also, even though the hotel is close to the city center, it is very quiet inside which makes it a good place after walking around the city all day. You will definitely feel like you are on vacation in paradise. The next time that I go to Florence, I want to stay at Hotel Colomba.

<Content>Wow! Fantastic, Warm  This is the place to stay. The staff are warm, friendly and so helpful it is hard to believe - they even remember what type of coffee you want for breakfast. They were also very willing to help us make arrangements for the tours, confirmations of reservations, etc. Hopefully we will be able to return and stay with them again.We located the Colomba on the internet and this is a great service. And it lived up to everything we imagined. How nice to have free access to the internet, a nice extra. We were a group of three couples and they located our rooms close together. The rooms were clean, comfortably and cool - the air conditioners worked very well. Each morning a table was set that allowed all 6 of us to sit together. Delightful!The hotel's location is within walking distance of all you want to visit in Florence and if you need to return for a rest it is easy to do without feeling like you have to walk to much. Thank you for your kind attention to our needs. I need more adjectives.

<Content>Loved the Colomba The Hotel Colomba was a friendly, clean, comfortable and convenient place to stay while in Florence. It is a very short taxi ride from the train station.It is only 2 blocks to the Academia Gallery and also within walking distance to everything we wished to see in Florence such as Duomo, Baptistry, Uffizi Gallery, San Croce, Ponte Vecchia. Breakfasts were very tasty and gave us a good start to our days. The staff was very friendly and helpful, directing us to some neighborhood resturants with authentic Italian meals (and good prices!!).We would go back!!!!!!!

<Content>A Gem of a Hotel My wife and i stayed in the Hotel Columba for 3 nights in May 2005. This hotel is a little gem. Location was excellent; 2 blocks to the Duomo, one block to the Accedemia in the other direction. All of Florences sights are walking distance. The staff was very warm and welcoming. Our room was a nice size and immaculate and quiet. Breakfast too was top notch. We would definitly stay here again.

<Content>Great Place to Stay, Florence Italy We were so happy with our stay at this hotel. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Sabina made our reservations for the museums and gave us a map and recommendations on other places to see. Our room was a quad and there was plenty of room for us (4 adults). We had 4 single beds that were very comfortable. The location of the hotel is excellent -you can walk to everything. The train station is an easy walk only 15 minutes. The breakfast was very good. I can't say enough on how wonderful it was to stay in such a friendly comfortable hotel. We highly recommend staying at this hotel.

<Content>Small gem in a jewel of a city. Just returned from a two week visit to Italy with a seven day, six night stay in Florence. We had, fortunately, booked at Hotel Colomba and being there made our stay in this lovely city even nicer!This is an intimate hotel (14/15 rooms) located on the second floor of an old building close to the Medici Palace and the Duomo. The hotel is within walking distance of all the major sites and, for us, about a twenty minute walk to the train station. The minute we arrived at the second floor lobby, via the small lift, we were made to feel at home and most welcome.This is a family-owned and run hotel. The couple are delightful people, the wife very fluent in English, and the sons helpful and patient with people like me who managed, twice, to mess up the free internet connection--a very nice service offered by the hotel. I particularly appreciated getting to know Sabina, a young woman who works with the family to make everyones stay so welcoming.Our room was number 11, a corner room with two large windows, large, excellent bed (with ironed sheets no less!), and another single bed, lots of hangers, spotlessly clean, plenty of storage space and an in-room safe. The small bathroom, equiped with a hair dryer and shower, was clean, well lit, and with plenty of hot water. My requirements for a bathroom have nothing to do with size and everything to do with cleanliness and lots of hot water--this hotel delivered!The continental breakfast, included in the price of the room, is excellent and varied--eggs, selection of cold cuts and cheeses, fresh fruit, juices, cereals, yogurt, sweet and regular rolls, with delicious coffee of your choice made to order and served to you. It was a delicious and pleasent way to start the day.Price-excellent, service-excellent, cleanliness-excellent, atmosphere-excellent (warm and inviting), location-excellent, staff-charming and helpful, food-excellent. I recommend this hotel for anyone without hesitation: business or vaction, family, couple or single. Should my husband and I be so lucky as to return to Florence, I will look forward to staying at the Colomba again and would feel like I was returning to a friend's place.

<Content>Absolutely perfect !! I am writing to say thank you for my family's wonderfull experience staying at the hotel Colomba.We enjoyed their buffet breakfast very much !!We felt so relieved about leaving our passport and tickets in our own safe in the room !! But muy husband was absolutaley thrilled about the DaVinci museum just downstairs - as an enjineer he was beside himself, and the children and I had to leave him behind to get some gelato at the corner.Thank you so much for the wonderfull time.

<Content>Worthy of all these 5 Star reviews My stay at the Hotel Colomba was so enjoyable that I wanted to both commend and recommend it to others. However, I see this was not an original idea. Everything you've read is true. The rooms are nice and the price is fair. The breakfast was one of the better ones. It's central location is fantastic (easy walk to Il Duomo, San Lorenzo Market, Uffizi, Ponte Vechio). The family who runs it is extremely friendly and helpful (ask for their recommendation on bisteca fiorentina), etc. But the one thing I want to add (and which had originally prompted me to write) was how great they were w/ our daughter. My wife and I stayed here w/ our 16 month old and they treated her like their own grandchild w/ lots of attention. They genuinely made sure that HER stay was enjoyable as well, such as by always having milk available any time it was needed. Our time in Florence was truly enhanced staying here and we would gladly recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Florence, Italy My daughter is studying in Florence, Italy. Someone recommended this hotel to her for us to stay in when we visited. It was wonderful and affordable. We stayed three nights and I can't say enough positive things about it. The people who run it are great. They were very friendly and very helpful. The wife spoke fluent English. We had access to the internet. It was convenient to everything - walking distance. We did not have to take a bus anywhere. The price of our room included breakfast and the breakfast was terrific. I would highly recommend this hotel. Franny, Mary, and Bridget McGovern Cherry Hill, NJ

<Content>We loved our stay at the Hotel Columba This hotel is excellent. The hospitality we were shown was just wonderful. The hotel is centrally located in Florence with easy access to all of the attractions. We arrived by train and had no problem finding the hotel within a short time.The rooms are very comfortable. The breakfasts served in the morning were always a welcome treat to start the day. I would highly recommend the Hotel Columba

<Content>great hotel and great staff Even though you are above one of the busiest streets in Florence and the rooms are a bit sparce, the staff and location are excellent. Only 2 blocks away from the very heart of the city and the Duomo della Maria Fiora. The main open air market is only 1.5 blocks away too! The friendly english speaking staff are very helpful and nice too. Breakfast is served with a smile and food can be ready even if you need to eat when the kitchen is technically not open.

<Content>Many Happy Returns I first stayed at Hotel Colomba in 1995 as a backpacker and have returned no fewer than than seven times, recent visits with my family. The proprietors (Rosanna  Michele) continue to improve an already charming property indicating their committment to their patrons. The staff is welcoming  accomodating making this hotel our home away from home in Florence.The rooms are spacious  pristine. The location is truly ideal, situated an easy 10 minute walk from the main train station and only blocks from Il Duomo and the San Lorenzo market. The Hotel Colomba a wonderful respit for the solo traveler or for the entire family. English is spoken fluently here and breakfast is included.We intend to return as soon as possible.Vince  Jennifer

<Content>Great place to stay In the midst of the hustle and bustle that is Florence, the Colomba is an oasis of peace and tranquility.The rooms are large airy and clean with modern Facilities. The multi-lingual owners and staff are a delight and willing to go out of their way to deal with your particular difficulties and needs. Yes, it is on the second floor but there is a lift for the fitness challenged. The major sites are all within easy walking distance as are restaurants, shops and banks. You could do a lot worse than stay here.
