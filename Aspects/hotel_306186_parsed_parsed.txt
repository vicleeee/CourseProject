<Content>Very satisfactory, no-dissapointment hotel We booked our room at The Orchard Parade Hotel for our stay last Oct 18-21, 2008. We paid 180SGD/night (110 USD), inclusive of all taxes and charges. For this price, I would say that we got a good bargain given that the hotel was in a good location and had very likeable facilities. This hotel has a good arrival, it has a big facade, and immediately tells you that you are going to have a good stay. A bellhop cheerfully collected our luggage as we checked in in less than 15 mins. It was 11am at the time but the receptionist gave us our rooms right away without early check-in charges.The hotel's configuration is quite unique. We had to negotiate about 7 turns along the corridors since our room was quite far from the elevator. In our excitement to walk around Orchard, this is something we can easily forgive.Our room was a decent Superior room. It had a decent amount of space (just enough), right amount of furnishings and amenities (a sofa and side table, TV, bar, internet, office desk). It has a walk-in closet where the luggage counter is integrated. The bathroom was clean, had a bathtub, hot shower and toiletries. I coudln't find anything that I didn't like. The bed was good, wasn't hard or soft, it was just right. The bedsheets and pillocases felt good on the skin. We had a good night's rest every night. We also used the Internet (7SGD for 30 mins) just to check on e-mail, not bad at all. We also received a daily copy of the Straits Times, good for waiting while the spouse was int he bathroom.We didn't get the chance to try out the other facilities (swimming pool, bar, restaurants), since we just used the room for sleeping and showering. But this is a great-value hotel for this price! It met our minimum requirements, decent staff, good facilities (not spectacular, but good enough), and for that price, it's worth considering for a future stay.

<Content>Fantastic Bed!!!!! Hotel bed was divine slept far more than we ever have, should have and wanted to on holiday. Service brilliant paid an extra $60 per day for upgrade which included free laundry service two items per day, mini bar, breakfast and internet which we felt was good value for money hotel room had a view of the pool. Great location at one end of the main shopping streets. 10 minutes walk to Singapore's fabulous MRT. Purchase regular travel card and not tourist day card if staying for more than one day better value. Would recommend Sentosa Island and hop on hop off tour buses.

<Content>Hotel is average Stayed at hotel for business. Breakfast was horrible for each of my seven day trip. Room service was ok and there are only 4 English speaking channels on the TV and the rest do not come in because of bad recption. The rooms were nice and service was ok. What was good was the location. It is close to all the shopping on Orchard Rd. and there is plenty of things to do around the area. No spa in hotel, which was a disappointment. I would look for another hotel when I go back to Singapore.

<Content>Very average After a lot of research we finally settled for the Orchard Parade for our family holiday to Singapore. It's a good hotel with a great location, however, NOT for families. We were given 2 rooms on different floors, because - BEWARE - Kids are not allowed on some floors!! Checking -in took ages, the staff at the reception was un-interested and pre-occupied. They kept repeating the problem about the hotel being full, rather than try and solve the problem. Check-out was an even longer process. I'll say again, it's a good hotel with a great location. Rooms are fine and clean. But the reception staff really need a lesson in courtesy and politeness. Weren't they taught how to smile at resident guests? More of a hotel for business people. If you're staying longer, go to the Lanson Place Serviced Apts instead.

<Content>location great Hotel is good for location . it is nothing special and staff are not overly helpful. But if your only staying for a couple of days and want to shop this is great hotel for that because you will be surounded by shopping centres. The rooms are clean and reasonble size. It is a good hotel but dont go if your looking for something special.

<Content>Unforgettable, for the wrong reasons! Booked a family suite for my bday get together through phone booking. SPACIOUS.and thats that.yes it WAS BIG, HUGE, SPACIOUS, i could roll ard 20 times or play hide n seek with my partner but thats all that is nice abt it.whole hotel needs upgrading or new refurbishments.the front desk ppl seemed uninterested to check me in, appeared busy and had issues with her fellow colleague hence not smiling. (i know all this bcuz i was standing at the frontdesk asking to be checked in before anyone approached me for a good 10 mins. and 10 mins is a long time)all this could probably be becuz im a local. not a tourist. so they rather prioritize the tourists bcuz the tourists are future advocators of the hotel to help spread the word abt the hotel worldwide.the corridors are seriously eerie. so silent that i could HEAR the silence. me and friends experienced some eerie stuffs in the room too. For the amount that i paid for a family suite 600SGD plus or minus, i think that its overpriced and nothing to be wowed abt.For tourists, yes its a good location being that it is in the center of country n near Orchard Rd, but im sure u guys cud use the money and stay somewhr else that is worth the money. Anyways, Singapore is so small, it doesnt matter even if ur not staying in the heart of the city or the center of the country. Frm one end of the country to the other end it only take about 1 hr + to travel by train or at a lesser time by legitimate taxis/cabs.Venture out of the usual comfort zone and you'll be surprise by what other great hotels Singapore have got to offer.

<Content>Very spacious This was a great hotel to stay at with family, the rooms are very large, and very clean. We only stayed one night on our way to london so was proably a bit far from the airport. We stay there on our way back again but have the whole day to go shopping so it will be very convienent.

<Content>Worst Hotel I have stayed at in Singapore I have travelled over 20+ times to Singapore in the last 12 month and this was my first experiece at this hotel. It has a very good location but that is all it has..!!The rooms are adequate but very old and in need of updating. I had two rooms during my stay as the frst was a shambles. The Fridge was broken and the bed was like a concrete slab, both had leaking bathrooms, running water sounds all night long and the air conditioning was not working properly in the first one!When advised many times to the staff , nothing was done and it was oh yes we have heard this before we will look into it!Most hotels in SIngapore have freindly and helpfull staff, but not this one. They were arrogant and had not concept of customer services, especially given the hotel charge a ridculous rate for based purly on location!If you want a quiet, well run, comfortable hotel experince in Singapore DO NOT STAY at this over rated, over priced and poorly run hotel.

<Content>Great Location, Passable Hotel The hotel has a great location close to tourist shopping/dining destinations. The rooms are a little old but clean and adequate. The pool is acceptable, the gym is small and had no instructor/attendant when I was there.I think the hotel's an okay choice. Nothing fancy, but the prime location makes up for it.

<Content>Used to be good, but.... I have stayed at this hotel on 7 or 8 occasions, always on business. It was good at first, with great location. However my last 2 trips have been very disappointing. I will not return! Even though I had stayed there on a number of occasions there was not an ounce of gratitude. I found the reception staff and management very unhelpful, the rooms need refurbishing (especially on the car park side), the bar is greatly overpriced, as is internet access. There is very little leeway for extended check out facility, in fact I was reduced to showering in the pool side cubicle on my last day after business and prior to heading for dinner then airport. I do not seek any great favours, but a little comfort and courtesy...?I would not recommend this hotel except for its location.

<Content>A nice stay We made a last minute booking and could only get hold of this one which offered twin room with extra bed at a very reasonable price (S$260). When we checked in (at around 11:45pm), we were greeted by a nice gentleman at the front desk and were given a very spacious triple room at no extra charge - nice beds, clean, high quality bedding and very quiet. Our room is on the 3rd floor, is facing a back street. We cannot hear anything from upstairs or the neighbourhood.This is the fourth time I visited Singapore and I find Orchard Parade a very nice stopover.

<Content>Location Location Location The property in itself is nothing special. Regular sized rooms, adequate bathrooms, small sized pool, about average check in and check out facilities. Where this hotel scores is the Location. Situated bang on the Orchard Road, the Singapore high street. There is a Mcdonalds, Burger King, an American style Steak House, Haagen Dazs all within 100 meters. Add to that innumerable swanky malls and fashion labels on the same road, it becomes a perfect hotel for shopoholics like usThe hotel property also has a Starbucks and an official Manchester United Merchandise store in its own premises. We never sampled the food in the hotel with so many options around. The staff is courteous and efficient. Most sight seeing options are close by since this hotel is in heart of Singapore. I have stayed in Little India on an earlier visit but I like Orchard Parade better.

<Content>Not Impressed Check-in: First imression, was a bad impression. Our rooms were wrong, and the reception made absolutely NO intention of righting the wrong. My husband is very large, and they wanted us to sleep in single beds, when we paid for the king bed. She insisted there was nothing they could do, so I asked if she could recommed a hotel that could accomodate me. She handed me a phone book and carried on wioth other business. I was shocked at hold cold she was! THEN...I asked if I paid more, could they accomodate me. Of course they could, money talks (why didnt she just say that in the first place?) We had to pay to upgrade to a room with a King (even though that is in fact what we paid for on-line) and priveledges to use the Business Center which included nightly cocktails and hordervs.Stuart Anderson: As we waited for our room, we decided to eat here for lunch, it was familiar. In the entire restraunt there was my husband  I, and 3 other families. Once our food came, we never saw the waitress again. She left for the day and nobody took her place to help us. Horrible service!Business Center: It was actually very nice and the staff in here was friendly. The most friendly in the entire hotel. We got to know some of the staff and they spilled the beans on managment problems...saying all staff is unhappy. Our room came with a cocktail hour..but the staff admitted they did not know how to make cocktails. When we asked for drinks, they had no idea what the liquors were called so they allowed to go to the back and pull the liquor ourselves. Only one computer worked the entire time we were there. Light breakfast was also included...not bad.Pool: Nice, quiet, and clean. However, 1 outdoor shower busted and water poured out for over an hour. We let them know, but it obviously wasnt a priority.Salon: At the time we were there, there were 2 salons. One had been located in the Hotel for years and owned by an older woman, the other was fairly new and more modern. I visited the older one...she too spilled her beans as to how horrible the managment has been to everyone.Bottom Line: I would not recommend this hotel to anyone nor would I ever return. The service was absolutely nothing they boast on their website. It was neither warm nor welcoming...it was cold! A lot of nice things to look at, but nothing much nice to say.

<Content>Musty, Dusty and Loud I'm staying at the Orchard Parade at the moment on business, and wish to God I wasn't. Why?1. Smells of mould, damp and airfreshener2. If someone goes to the bathroom in any room above, beside or below my room, I can here everything in horrible detail3. Room service always seem to forget that I need cutlery4. My room key-card has failed to work 3 times, meaning I have had to go downstairs eight floors for another one. 5. The bath has hairs in it which are not mine. How did they get there?6. Every surface in the room is incredibly dusty. More minor gripes:1. The balcony has no chairs. Why not?2. Breakfast is horrendous. I am now eating in Starbucks next door. 3. The loungers in the pool area smell of sweat. I won't be coming back.

<Content>Good Value for money This hotel is a short distance to all the shops and restaurants. Would recommend this for a family holiday or for the keen shopper. Very good value for money, cheap price and comfortable rooms. Staff were friendly. But there was only two computers in the lobby, a bit of an inconvenience if the queue is long. Overall great value for money for a great hotel.

<Content>Nightmare experience One word to describe this hotel experience....nightmare. From poor service to noisy hotel rooms the whole management should be changed. Also don't book a taxi using the concierge since they use the limo service even if you ask them to book a normal singapore taxi. I paid a S$25 fare for a S$10 ride due to their incompetence. Only saving grace is the location, but that does not justify staying there

<Content>Good for families My husband, 3 young children and I booked a clean, comfortable and enormous family room with large ensuite bathroom for a reasonable price. We only stayed one night, en route to Australia, but the hotelhas a convenient central location and is only 20-30 mins from the airport. Roof-level pool is not outstanding but very pleasant. Desk service is efficient but beware the luggage porters, who are slow!

<Content>Not great I have just finished a three night stint (on business) at this hotel and I have to say that it is a place with some problems. After reading some of the reports here noise problems on the lower floors, I specifically asked for something high up when the booking was made. On arrival, check-in was pretty quick and I was duly allocated a room on the 15th floor. The room itself was OK. It was on the larger size with a big bed and a microscopic bathroom. The bathroom, however, seemed to be the cause of my problems. The noise that the plumbing makes (all though the night) is horrendous. My own shower water gargled away for ages after the shower had finished, but worse still the drainage pipes from the upper floors must run directly past my room and made a constant racket all night long.The lobby of the hotel smells overpoweringly of lemon. I found the aroma quite off putting each time that I passed through.Breakfast on the second floor (you get little blue vouchers for each day of your stay) was adequate but only just. The food laid out was quite basic. The made-to-order omelettes were good but I found that I had to wait a long time for them to be cooked. I was staying on my own at the hotel and had to share tables at breakfast each day (the eating area is not that large). This was OK for me but might out others off.The hotel itself is located right at the end of Orchard Road. Returning late at night was always a bit of an adventure. A number of 'street ladies' seems to work in the area and I was accosted for business on several occasions. This was generally non-threatening but could be off putting, especially for families.Overall, it was an OK stay, but nothing more. The bed was comfy, but the room was expensive and I expected better.

<Content>Great find in Singapore I stayed here for a week and would definitely stay again. I immediately liked the room (it was their superior/deluxe category, standard rooms as not as appealing) which was a good size and had a sofa, desk, big bed and plenty of storage space. But the best thing was the balcony with French doors. I had to spend quite a bit of time in the room working and it was great to sit at the desk on the high speed internet and have the doors wide open beside me 鈥?it felt like being outdoors even when I was indoors working.The pool area of the hotel is nice but most of the sunbeds are in the shade a lot of the time so it鈥檚 maybe not ideal if you are hoping to get a suntan. It has a small but useful fitness room with five cardio machines, weights machines and small selection of free weights. Adjacent to the gym is a very useful laundry room.I鈥檝e been back to Singapore just recently and stay here again, it鈥檚 definitely my hotel of choice nowadays in the city.

<Content>Average but comfortable A fairly basic hotel but comfortable.Our room didn't have a view which was a little disappointing and was a bit on the small side, but we were fairly high up so had no disturbance from the disco which others have experienced.We were told that breakfast wasn't included despite this being printed on our voucher. This was an issue which has been taken up with our tour operators, but Starbucks is directly next door and that suited us.If I went back I think I would stay the other end of town near the harbour area. However, ideally located on Orchard Road for shopping and only a short walk to the underground, though don't underestimate how long Orchard Road actually is. This hotel is situated at the one end so you may wish to stay further up.

<Content>Strange Breakfast Arrangement Being a business traveler, I had no choice but to stay in this hotel since we have corporate rate.By the time we arrived at the hotel, it was over midnight. Only a couple was at the front desk arguing something with the staff there. My colleague and I waited at the front desk for a while, nobody seemed to notice us until I raised my voice to look for help. And they are generally working in a very laid-back style, speak slowly, and move slowly. Unfortunately I was upgraded to the executive room. When I said unfortunately, I mean their breakfast for the so-called executives. We could never figure out why they offer American buffet breakfast for ordinary rooms, but only 10 choices of food selection for exeucitve rooms. We were told that we had to pay extra to get the American breakfast. However, the ladies serving us breakfast were very polite unlike the others. And the location is very inconvenient which is located on the top floor of the building, unlike the usual breakfast area which is located right next to the lobby. That means every morning, we had to take the lift to have breakfast, and wait for the lift again to be able to go out.From my room, I could hear pumping music even after midnight. Later my colleagues told me that there was a disco located downstairs. Also, I realized that the balcony door was unable to be locked...Finally, it was the check out time. I was thinking to take advantage of my executive room previledge. But when I arrived at their executive service counter outside the breakfast place, the lady told me to wait for a while because she needed to show some guests around the building. After 15 mins waiting, I decided to go downstairs and do the check out at the usual counter.But I must say, the location of this hotel is very convenient. It is located right at the end of the Orchard road which is full of shopping malls. About 10 mins walk from the metro. I'm not sure about the price since there is no comparison.Anyway, I probably won't stay here again if I had a choice.

<Content>Very poor service I stayed 2 nights at Orchard Parade in June 2006 but I would definitely not go back to this hotel again. I was being moved to 3 different rooms (including one room which have not been made up after the previous occupants left) on the first day of my arrival and it was close to midnight before the staff got things right. The staff kept telling me one thing but then not doing it. Was told that an extra bed would be put into the room only to find out hours later that they couldn't put an extra bed into a standard room. The excuse was that they had misunderstood and thought that we were happy to have 3 people in a double bed (after prepaying for a triple room??) Was then told that a bigger room was available for us and someone would send the key up now but after half an hour of waiting (packed up and not able to do anything), no one came. When I called the front desk to follow up, the person who answered said she would find out what's happening and call me back in 5 mins but waited for another half an hour, no one called or came up. Had to then go down physically to the front desk before they started looking into the system to find a replacement room! Meaning that I could have just waited there in the room (based on what they told me) the whole night and no one would have come up!The saga continued when the replacement room I was given was not even made up yet after the previous guests left! Thought mine was probably a one-off case until I was passing by the hotel's reception the next evening and overheard an angry guest at the reception shouting that this was the hotel with the worst service he had ever been to.

<Content>Our First and Last Visit to the Orchard Parade My wife and I were booked into the Orchard Parade by an airline during a Business Class overnight stopover. Had we not been so tired when we arrived at about 9:30 PM, after seeing the room allocated to us I would gladly have paid to go to another hotel. The Orchard Parade is a very tired hotel, particularly once you get past the reception area.Check-in took ages despite us having a confirmed reservation. We weren't offered porter assistance, possibly because we had only pull along cabin bags. This was unfortunate because the room we were allocated took some finding. It was tucked away in a dark corner behind the elevators, in the opposite direction to every other room on that floor. After finally locating the room and opening the door, we quickly guessed that it must be a special room kept for unsuspecting travellers whose accommodation is being paid for by an airline.We were presented with a quite depressing room. It was clean enough, apart from the stained carpet, and the linen was acceptable. However, the bathroom was tiny, tired and hideously decorated. The mould encrustation between the tiles was a nice decorative touch though, as was the colony of mould or mildew growing on the ceiling of the bathroom. The accent on mould growth carried through into the bedroom, which had a matching growth on the ceiling and colonies of mould about 5 mm long growing out of the aircon outlet. Mould must make aircon more effective because the efficiency of the aircon was the room's saving grace.It was difficult to see much of the other non-organic decoration in the room because of the poor lighting, although we did see that the room had been repainted relatively recently. It was a pity that the Hotel reinstalled the original scratched and dirt-encrusted electrical switches and outlets, some of which weren't fixed too well to the wall.As another reviewer observed, free entertainment is provided by the almost non-existant soundproofing in the rooms. We tossed and turned for some time whilst being forced to listen to a conversation, at normal conversational level I might add, between guests in the room on the other side of the bathroom wall some 5 m away.After a restful night's sleep we attended the restaurant for breakfast, only to be told that meals were not included. This was despite 'all meals' being clearly annotated on the accommodation voucher provided to us. However, after a visit to reception and a discussion with the Duty Manager we were allowed to eat what turned out to be a very good breakfast served by very friendly and attentive staff in a nicely decorated restaurant. Whilst eating, though, we observed at least six other guests experience the same 'misunderstanding' over the inclusion of breakfast in the room rate.Check-out took ages again and, despite my discussion with the Manager only an hour beforehand, we were charged initially for breakfast and for room service that we neither ordered nor received. This was resolved once more with the Manager, with whom I was almost on a first name basis by now, and we left happy to see the Orchard Parade sip into the distance behind our taxi.Would I recommend this hotel? Definitely; for demolition.

<Content>Quiet room with banging techno until 3.30 am! Paid $220 for our stopover stay and would rate this hotel a 3-star at the very best: musty smells, old furniture, horrible bathrooms and an on-site disco to boot! The noise (bad banging techno) started up after midnight and continued to at least 3.30 / 4 am (this is how long it took me to get to sleep)! Not at all recommended, unless you're only there for shopping at Orchard and don't plan to sleep!

<Content>Customer Relations When booking to fly to Australia we specifically chose Singapore as a stop over as it included named accommodation of a high standard at the Orchard and more importantly transfers to and from the airport.On my arrival at the check in desk I was confronted by a queue which took nearly 1 hour to get to the desk where I was informed that they had no information with regard to my booking for either transfers or accommodation, although we were recorded on the flight information.After nearly 1 hour of investigation by the desk clerk it was evident he could not resolve the situation so he advised me to take a taxi to the hotel and speak to them directly. We arrived at the orchard hotel at approx 2030 Singapore time and proceeded to the check in desk and explained we had a confirmed and paid for booking for the night to be told that they had no record of our booking and were fully booked for the night.We produced our paperwork confirming our booking and the duty manager was called to investigate the situation.The duty manager, Andrew Fletcher contacted the hotels main reservation dept and endeavoured to find a solution to the unfortunate situation. During this time I contacted our agents customer service department on my mobile phone to see if they were able to resolve the situation or offer advice as to what could be done or what the situation was.The Duty Manager after his several phone calls then informed us that the hotel was indeed already overbooked and our booking definitely did not exist within their booking system and therefore we would be unable to stay at the orchard hotel for the night.I was at this time still on the phone to our agents customer service dept where I was being told that according to them our booking had been processed and confirmed and therefore I would have accommodation at the hotel in question. I informed them that this was not the case and asked her to arrange for a suitable hotel to be found for us to spend the night.After several long conversations with customer service I was informed that it was not possible for them to source us alternative accommodation for the evening and that the only advice she could offer was for us to 鈥榬eturn to the airport and spend the night sleeping there in the departure lounge鈥?At this stage the duty manager of the orchard hotel, who could not believe the advice of our agent took it upon himself to try and find us alternative accommodation himself by contacting several local hotels and finally managed to find us a room in a hotel close to the orchard. He then directed his staff to take us and our bags to this hotel and book us in. So although we did not stay here we certainly got a superb impression of the staffs level of customer care.

<Content>Nice Place we stayed at this hotel back in Febuary 2006 when we first got there we were told there was no room for us and that the hotel was fully booked, there was an error with our agent back in london, after a lot of phone calls they found us a room but we had to pay for it again even though we had already paid back in England funny hoe they found a r oon when we said we would pay again and claim later, our room was very big and i could not find fault with it, at night my husband said he could hear the disco but im deaf in one ear so i ould not hear it. We did not eat in this hotel but we did just out side in the black angus steak bar i have never eaten so much in all my life what a great meal. we found the staff very nice always opening doors for us and getting a taxi was no trouble at all, The day we left we got a call to say that we did not have to pay now as it had all been sorted out with the hotel and our tour company back in england which eas great as we did end up in one of the best rooms at no extra cost to us, i stay here again

<Content>Only stay here if you like loud music The staff on the front desk didn't have the rooms organised when we arrived at 2.30 pm. We were eventually allocated rooms on the 3rd floor. Everything was very clean and the rooms were adequate for a 2 night stop over. However, on the second night the disco started at 10.30 pm and finished at 6.30 am. The noise wasn't just inconvenient, it was totally unacceptable. The walls of the end room actually vibrated.The pool area was very attractive and the breakfast was average. It would have made more sense if all the food was set out together, instead of part of it hidden. I would never stay here again.
