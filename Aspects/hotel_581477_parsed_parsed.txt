<Content>Perfect This is a lovely residence just outside of the city centre. The owners are very friendly and booked us two perfect restaurants for our weekend stay, which we loved. Rooms are large with high ceilings but fairly basic. This is a residence and not a hotel so bare that in mind. We thought the charm of the building, the helpful and frendly owners, and the location (we enjoyed the short walk into and out of town, but buses run regularly) made this a good alternative to pricely centrally located hotels.

<Content>Great hotel We really enjoyed the Residence Michelangiolo for its tuscan charm. It was a little bit off the beaten track but not hard to get into the heart of the city on the 23 a/b bus or a 15-20 min walk. It was nice to travel over the Arno into the city and I would recommend this place. The room was enormous and the staff was very friendly and accomodating.

<Content>Loved the Residence Michelangiolo The owners Angela and Cheribino made us feel welcome in this wonderful family home which has been beautifully redone into a quintessential European residence. Our room was lovely and spacious with a kitchenette and a beautiful outdoor porch with table and chairs. We stayed here 5 days and cannot wait to return. In fact, we would like to return with friends, on our next trip. The location is within walking distance to the center of Florence or to a taxi stand, if you prefer. It was very convenient to be able to park our rented car within the gated property. Throughout other parts of Italy, we stayed in hotels, but here, every evening, we felt like we were coming home. Angela was very helpful with any information that we needed.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel The hotel is in a wonderful location, about 20 mins walk from Florence along the river and has secure car parking which is a serious bonus. The hotel itself is beautiful - our room was stunning with huge ceilings and beautiful decor. Our hosts were very helpful and friendly and our stay here couldn't have been better. The room was large, the bed comfy and the room spotlessly clean. I would have no reservation in recommending Residence Michangiolo - especially if you have a car.Thanks for a great stay.

<Content>True taste of Tuscany My wife and I stayed at the Residence for 6 days in late September. We booked the reservation on -line after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. The reviews were accurate and recent reviews also reflect my feelings about the location and ambience of the facility. This is a wonderful villa run by two friendly and accomodating people. The villa was the family home of Cherubino and has been completely renovated by Angela and he. They are devoted to providing an enjoyable experience and as such are always happy to answer questions, book reservations and help to enhance your visit to Florence.The accomodations are spacious and comfortable, the grounds are beautiful. The kitchenette is adequate for breakfast and the coffee is excellent. The bed was wonderful, supportive but not too firm. We would happily stay here againThe villa is a 5 minute walk from the river and a 20 minute walk to the city center (Uffizzi, Ponte Veccio, etc.). Train station is on the opposite side of the city. Spectacular views of Florence are a 10 minute walk to the Piazza Michelangelo, don't miss this view at sunset. (Angela can show you the shortcut up the hill).Local restaraunts are OK but it's really worth going in town at night for dinner , better food and more fun.Great place to stay especially if you rent a car. Free and easy parking!! Also reasonably priced by Italian standards. Overall, a very positive experience, a place where you don't have to feel entirely like a tourist. Lots of fun and well worth the stay.

<Content>Charming; Excellent Hospitality My husband and I spent a week here while on our honeymoon. It was our first visit to Italy for the both of us and we had a wonderful time. We enjoyed the location of Residence Michelangiolo because it is outside the city center so it's not super crowded; but at the same time it is within walking distance (approx. 20 minutes). Angela and her husband were very welcoming and were happy to answer all of our questions (which were a lot) since this was our first time to Florence. They had great suggestions as far as where to go, what to see, and were willing to help with directions, booking tickets, etc.We were very pleased with the size of our room and the adjoining bathroom, which was very modern and up to date. Overall, we would highly recommend the Residence Michelangiolo and look forward to staying there again in the future.Kelly and MarcAlexandria, VirginiaUSA

<Content>Great place for a wedding My wife and I stayed here for the wedding of my niece in Florence, and thoroughly enjoyed it.The hotel is a beautiful semi-detached villa in its own grounds, on a main road. Being on the way to the hospital there tends to be a lot of ambulance sirens - but this is Italy! We were on the ground floor and had some noise from people entering and leaving the hotel - but no real problem. We had a small terrace which was nice, and our very own 'kitchen in a cupboard', which was very useful. The bed was comfortable and we had plenty of space. Angela was very friendly and helpful.Down the road is a lovely little cafe for breakfast and there are a few others worth visiting for evening meals rather than going back into town. The trip to the city centre is either a 15 minute walk along the river or a short bus ride - very easy.This is a lovely place to stay - away from the centre and with real style. We would certainly stay there again.

<Content>A Truly Wonderful Experience We stayed at this Gem for three nights (Sept10-13)based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. The entire experience was way beyond expectations. The room was clean, large and comfortable. We had a door leading out to a wonderful terrace and garden. A perfect place to start your day with a coffee or end it with a glass of wine. The location is perfect as it is close enough to walk to the sights yet out of the central area for quiet evennings. If you enjoy walking as we do, it is an easy 20 minute walk along the river to Ponte Vechio or catch the bus for a 5 minute ride.Angela and Cherubino are just wonderful people. They did everything and anything to make our stay memorable. They recommended local places to eat away from the tourist areas. We found these places to be more reasonably priced and of better quality. We were the only non locals in the restaurant.We will be returning to Florence and will be staying here again.Thank You Angela and Cherubino

<Content>Wonderful retreat in Florence This lovely hotel provided the perfect quiet retreat when the craziness of Florence became overwhelming! Delightful host Angela was helpful and welcoming, providing great information. Our twin room was HUGE with massive windows, comfortable beds and a great bathroom. Across the river from the main attractions, this is a great brisk 1/2 hour walk or a short bus trip from the Uffizi and other attractions.  Our late train from Florence to Paris meant we checked out long before we needed to go, but Angela was very, very gracious in keeping our baggage and even in letting us come back and freshen up in the downstairs washroom before we headed out for the overnight trip.  We would recommend this hotel highly! Great facilities, great location and wonderful staff.

<Content>Perfect place to stay in Florence This is the perfect hotel for a stay in Florence. My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights as part of our honeymoon and it was ideal - only a 15 minute walk away from the hustle and bustle of the centre along a lovely tree lined street. The residence sits in from the road and has its own garden area which gives the place a really peaceful feel.We booked a junior suite and it was magnificent - really huge room with a seating area and kitchenette. Whilst breakfast is not proved, the owner stocks the kitchenette with croissants and drinks (included in the room price) which is perfect. There is also a little hob where you can make your own food which was very welcome after 2 weeks of restaurants!The owners are extremely helpful and friendly and made us aware of special events happening in the city . Fantastic place - we will definitely stay here when we return to Florence!

<Content>The place for Florence with Family We stayed for 5 nights in this wonderful villa. We are a family of 2 adults and 2 kids and stayed in a 2 room apartment on the first floor. The rooms were spacious, air conditioning more than ample, great maid service. NIce local cafe down the block and a great walk to all the sights.Angela and Cherubino were so accomodating and provided us with directions to get everywhere. We had no problems getting to the highways to go to Sienna and Cinque Terra. Do not take free parking on the premises for granted. Its awesome.On our 17 day trip, this place was the best value for the money, even the weak dollar!Ezra ShashouaBoca Raton, FL.

<Content>A Fantastic Accommodation This property is fantastic. We were warmly greeted, museum reservations were made prior to our arrival and most importantly the rooms were grand. We had two adjoining rooms for our family (my husband and our two teenage children); they are beautifully appointed with very high ceilings and lovely furnishing. Located just across the river and a few blocks down from the Uffizi Gallery, we were in walking distance to the best Florence has to offer. We had no hesitation walking to town for dinner or home afterward. The host and hostess are extremely helpful and very nice. We stayed 2 nights at this fantastic residence hotel in August. I highly recommend this accommodation.

<Content>Full relaxation A relaxing 4 days were spent here. The hotel is situated in a very pleasant location with easy access to the town as well as other interesting sites in the vicinity. Both Angela and Cherubino were extremely helpful with any advice we sought. This will be the only place to stay for our next visit to Firenze.

<Content>Great Base to Explore Florence We stayed for 4 nights in the Residence Michelangiolo at the start of our Tuscany Tour. We arrived from Bologna airport in our hire car and the sat nav found it no problem. Angela the owner greeted us and was very welcoming, gave us loads of info on locality buses etc, which we did not use as it is only a 20 min walk to Ponte Vecchio in centre of Florence. Our room was lovely and airy and we had a good sized bathroom plus the airconditioning was a proper system and we slept really well as the room was lovely and cool. There is no breakfast but there was a coffee bar close by serving coffee, tea and breakfast pastries. I would recommend as a base for a visit to Florence. It is close to the Piazza Michelangelo which is worth the hike up as it offers stunning views of Florence. Also is you want to avoid queues to Ufizzi and the academia book your tickets in advance on website. Download Rick Steves podcast guides to Uffizzi and the academia, they are good.

<Content>Wonderful hospitality We were thrilled with our stay in this beautifully restored villa. Although a fair walk from the centre (good 20 mins) there are buses that stop very nearby. We were able to leave our hire car in their car park which was a great bonus.Angela could not have been more helpful in terms of recommending restaurants and even cycling frantically after us one evening to stop us going to one she'd forgotten was shut!They do not provide breakfast - and it would be great if they decided to do so one day - but we there was a very good cafe nearby.All in all, a very pleasant memory of our first time to Florence and we would happily return.

<Content>A cool and peaceful little palace We had a wonderful stay in the residence michelangiolo. It is in a very peaceful and pleasant location - just about 15 minute walk along the riverside to Florence centre. The owners are extremely pleasant, helpful and friendly and will give you some good advice on sightseeing tours, restaurants etc. We had breakfast with the locals at cafe michelangelo just around the corner from the residence - the coffee and pastries were wonderful! Our room was tastefully decorated and furnished and the small fridge was very useful to keep chilled drinks!

<Content>This is a beautiful boutique hotel/villa This is a family run hotel, Angela and Cherubino are friendly relaxed and polite people who have their customers best interests at heart. It is small with huge spacious and fully equiped rooms, beautiful antique windows and shutters open out onto a well maintained quiet garden. It is situated south of the river on a tree lined old part of the city. The welcome and advise we received re sights was spot on. It truly deserves all the previous accolades other reviewers have made. Will return againnext year.

<Content>Very nice place to stay away from the madding crowds Excellent stay, nice and quiet, Angela was very helpful in directing us on good places to eat and what to see as my 13 year old son and I were only there for 3 nights. There is no formal breakfast. You get a mini kitchehette with the usual local bakery products in plastic bags to eat in the morning, you make your own T or coffee etc. Juice boxes are provided plus a small fridge.We did enjoy our stay, would go back again...loved Florence, walked for miles and miles. The D bus takes you to the main train station.

<Content>Full of character Residence Michelangiolo is a quiet vila just out of town. A 20 minute walk into Florence, it is a good choice if you are travelling by car, as there is free secure parking on site. Angela and Cherubino are very helpful and gave us good restaurant recommendations along with directions for our onward journey.Lovely large room with high ceilings. Nice bathroom, although be warned, we did not have a shower curtain or screen over the bath and we ended up mopping up the floor after each shower. Note that there are no restaurant facilities available, however there is a small kitchenette in your room that has breakfast supplies, something I'd overlooked until we arrived, but it was good fun making real coffee in the coffee pot provided.You are a short walk from the Piazza Michelangiolo, which you must go to, as it has spectacular views over Florence. We went to roticierre down the road from the piazza, heading out of Florence and bought chicken, salads and a bottle of wine and went and watched the sunset in the piazza, it was a real highlight!

<Content>Yes, all the glowing reviews here are true!! Yes, it's all true! Location-the place is close enough to the city to walk to, but far enough to be quiet(sort of...it's Italy, remember?).The rooms are huge and clean.The staff, CH and A, were the best most friendly, courteous hosts we have ever met; Among many things, CH recommended;-a one day drive itinerary thru Siena and San Gimigniano (great!)-a restaurant in Via San Nicolo (also great)-Even found out for us a (trucker's) restaurant in Regello(towards Arezzo) where they serve a HUGE plate of pasta...(true too)-Paoli's restaurant in Firenze -for dinner (beautiful)among many other things (he even waited for us to arrive at 20:30-we got lost...)We stayed in room 103 (Margherita) which faces the backyard and we loved it.And yes, bring bug spray, even though they have a plug in the wall kind of mosquito repellent, these bugs are very aggressive!

<Content>The best in Florence We stayed here at the beginning of July and were absolutely thrilled with the beautiful rooms, spacious bathroom and kitchenette.The residence is ideally situated, far enough away from the centre of Florence to feel peaceful, close enough to see everything you need to.The transport links from the residence are brilliant, with the local bus stop being only 3 minutes walk away. The irish bar on the corner was our local for the time we stayed and felt like home from home.Overall, I dont think there was anywhere better to stay, and if I return to Florence, i wont hesitate to stay there again

<Content>5 Star Service- loved location and hotel!!! Our stay at Residence Michelangiolo was absolutely perfect!! Great value for the price and location! We walked everywhere! Angela was an amazing host- always willing to lend a helping hand-she helped us with everything- from booking museums, to finding locations, good restaurants- even called our wine tour operator for instructions at 11pm at night- she's amazing!! Follow their directions from the train station- we tried taking a bus from the train station and that didn't work out too well- since we got off at the top of the hill- and the hotel is at the bottom. This was our favorite hotel on our honeymoon- beautiful rooms and BIG bathrooms too!!! Enjoy your stay! All the best, Erin  Craig (Calgary, Canada)

<Content>An unforgettable stay We stayed 3 nights in the Suite in Residence Michelangiolo on our honeymoon.We were 100% satisfied and would go back anytime.The Residence is 10 min walk from the center and is therefore perfectly located to visit the city without a car and at the same time it provides for quietness after a day of sightseeing with a nice garden and residential neighbourhood !The Residence is a beautiful home from the 1930s totally renovated and offers a comfortable stay in spotless rooms decorated with style. The owner Angela is extremely nice and helpful and this also contributed to make our stay so special.We hope to come back soon!Oliver and Magalie from Zurich

<Content>Lovely Accommodation Very pleased with our choice of the picturesque Residence Michelangiolo for our stay in Florence. After a busy days site seeing, in apparently unseasonal heat (38-40 celcius) we found the Residence a welcome respite from the high temperature, the crowds and the hustle and bustle of the city. Loved our room, it was spacious, elegantly furnished, cool and spotlessly clean and best of all it had coffee and tea making facilities - a rarity in Italy. Angela and Cherubino are delightful hosts and assisted us with bookings and other arrangements for visits to attractions before and during our stay.As mentioned by others the Residence is located in a quiet area of Florence and sits to the edge of all the attractions of the city. We enjoyed the walk into the city but used the little local bus - about a two minute walk from the Residence, when we tired of walking - which wasn't often despite the heat. We really liked the restaurants around the Residence as well. The food was good and the prices for the most reasonable. The Trattoria down the road was a particular stand out - take your Italian phrase book to unravel the menu though!The Residence Michelangiolo will definately be our choice should we be lucky enough to return to Florence.

<Content>our favorite among 4 other places stayed at We loved this hotel and it's location. We stayed here during the summer making this location a great escape from the crowds. We enjoyed the 15 minute walk along the river into town. If you don't feel like walking, there is a bus stop 5 minutes away.The rooms were very spacious and the staff was very nice. I asked the hotel to make reservations to see David for us at the very last minute via email and I received a very prompt response back with everything taken care of. Thank you!We will be staying here again!

<Content>superb rooms and location The reception was warm and caring. Rooms especially comfortable, clean and beautiful. Location is quiet with parking and greenery, though a little out of the city but the 15-20 minute walk enjoyable and an experience in itself. The breakfast fare could be improved. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful Choice This hotel has been accurately described in many, many good reviews, as a lovely place outside of the city center. Here are the salient features:-Air conditioner worked WELL (not a given in Italy)-Warm, very hospitable staff. Can't say enough good things about our hosts.-large, beautiful rooms, we felt we were in a country villa. Perfect place for a honeymoon.-It is a pretty good walk from the center of town--- about 20-40 minutes---after walking the city from 0900 until 2100, walking back to the room was slightly perturbing----albeit a lovely stroll along the Arno. (We should have made use of the nearby bus stop)The bottom line:We absolutely loved our stay (sadly, it was only one night) and can't wait to return!

<Content>Lovely hosts, nice place to stay We arrived (4 of us, 2 couples) very hot and sticky on motor bikes on a very hot and humid afternoon. The hosts made us very welcome and soon had us checked in and cooling in our airconditioned room. The room was adeqate, very clean and well equipped, apart from the fact there was no shower on the wall in the bathroom, only a handheld one on the taps in the bath. It was definitely more than a 10 minute walk into town - more like 20 to 30 minutes, especially in the heat, so we did sometimes use taxis, especially after a long hot day sight seeing. There's only one restaurant in the vacinity, so you have to go into Florence at night to eat which is very expensive and not particularly good. We went to the local cafe for breakfast, this was quite resonable for Florence, but they do not speak much english so be prepared to use your italian phrasebook! All in all, a pleasant stay, but I might choose a hotel with more facilities nearer the centre rather than a 'residence'. The big plus for us was the secure parking especially with the bikes being Harley Davidsons.

<Content>Beautiful and Peaceful We stayed for 2 nights at the Residence Michelangiolo in June. It is a beautiful large house set in Gardens in a leafy area of Florence not far from the city centre. We found Angela who manages RM to be extremely welcoming and helpful. The room was large very comfortable and attractive with high ceilings and some useful features including a kitchenette. Getting into the city is quite easy walking (about 15 mins) or by bus. Definitely recommended.

<Content>Just lovely... My wife and I and our 3 year old son stayed at Residence Michelangiolo during the Easter Holidays in 2008. The property is simply lovely. Rooms are spacious, very clean and very comfortable. Host Angela is most helpful in attending to all our needs and questions. It's a charming walk from the hotel and town, and not prohibiting at all even with a toddler. Free parking is a bonus. This is a great place to stay in Florence.

<Content>Loved the Residence Michelangiolo! I really enjoyed my stay here. Angela was waiting to check me in and was very sweet and immediately told me about Florence and gave me a map with directions. She told me that I had gotten a free upgrade because there was a problem with my other room. What a stroke of luck! I had 2 private entrances! I also had two large rooms and a bathtub. The tub was great after a day of walking all day. The bed was super comfortable and I slept with the windows open all night and woke to the sounds of birds and children playing next door, not to mention the church bells! It was beautiful out of my windows. I want to bring my family there next time. It is very convenient to walk to the center of town and very scenic.

<Content>Great building, a bit optimistic on proximity to the city! Just returned from a tour of Tuscany  stayed for 2 nights at the RM on the way back to Pisa airport. I followed the tripadvisor recommendations and booked direct with the residence.Their website does state a 5/10 minute walk into town which is incorrect - it is at least 20+ minutes which is great in good weather but we had a heat wave  at 40 degrees it is not an option! A bus is available nearby.We had a large room with a vast ceiling, massive impressive bathroom with new everything and a kitchenette room. This was stocked on arrival with water, juice, teabags, coffee, cakes, etc all free which was a nice touch.One minor irritation was our ground floor room opened (as they all do) into reception  the phone seemed to ring twice on the hour from 7am. Still, lots to see in Florence......Pick a first floor room to avoide the heavey footsteps of those upstairs, or at least stock up on the excellent local wine to deaden the senses.Angela (owner) was great, weather too hot (never thought I would complain about that)  residence above average.It is a little far out for a quick restaurant trip as there are only 2 nearby, neither of which open Sunday's.

<Content>Angela, Angela Having driven down from Venice we were greated at the gate by Angela. Phew! after driving on the Autostrada I was happy to park the car. Great location about 15 minute walk to city center and in a pleasant neighborhood. Rooms were high tech as was security. Large and comfortable with huge windows. First floor rooms had patio. Parking is free. Small kitchen allowed me to cook an Italian meal-not easy but possible. Angela anticipated your needs and fulfills your wishes. My wife drinks decaf and she ran out to get some when we asked. We drove to the wine country one day visiting a small town of San Gianacome(spelling off) which was a great day trip and Angela provided great directions to find it. Typical European shower to deal with-like the kitchen not easy but possible. If you don't need to be in city center with all the other tourists then this is highly recommended, especially if you enjoy to walk or just stroll off a good meal.

<Content>A little Gem! Myself and my boyfriend stayed here in June 2007. We booked directly with the hotel having contacted them via their website. Situated to the south of Florence's centre, and easily accessible using the mini buses that run through Florence, this hotels location could not be better. Just far away enough from the crowded centre, without being too far from the sights. We walked into the centre and back every day and it was about 15mins, and not strenuous.The hotel itself was spotlessly clean, situated in lovely grounds and the room we had was spacious and met all our requirements. As a bonus, the fridge in the room was stocked daily with water, juices and milk, for our use, at no extra cost. The hosts were friendly and informative.If like ourselves, you do not fancy venturing into the centre for an evening meal, there are several restaurants located near the hotel, which were all nice. Our favourite however was Affe di Bacco, which we would highly recommend and which we visited on more than one occasion! The food and atmostphere were both excellent.

<Content>Elegant Villa, Large Wonderful Rooms, Great Hospitality Angela came to the door to great us as we arrived and showed us to our wonderful room on the second floor, which was most impressive: very high ceiling, beautiful furniture, nice kitchen inside a closet and two large windows with great curtains looking at a green garden. It felt like being shown a room in a palace. The bathroom was nice, the towels perfect and the television set very convenient. We stayed for a week. Coming back from the various tourist activities was always a pleasant experience. We were given a key to the villa so we could come in any time and it was a pleasure to walk into the peaceful place and enter our huge room. Transportation to and from the city was easy: five minutes in one of two buses that stop a block and a half from the hotel and go directly downtown. Using the local transportation gave us a feeling of living in Italy and it took us away from the very touristy center of Florence, which can be overwhelming. I would definitely go back to this palatial place and I would definitely recommend it as a wonderful place to stay in Florence.

<Content>Quiet, pleasant location We found our stay at Residence Michelangiolo pleasant and the staff very helpful with tips on tours and places to eat nearby. The walk into Florence historical centre was a little further than quoted (20mins brisk walk, but it took us 40mins strolling) but the walk was pleasant. The bed was comfortable and the fixtures were newly renovated and nice. We'd recommend this place to other couples but singles might find it better to stay somewhere closer to the centre and more social to meet other travellers (although there was an Aussie pub down the road!).

<Content>Highly recommended! Fantastic residence, wonderful owner who explained to us at the very beginning all that we needed to know, including best places to eat and visit. The room was majestic, spotless clean, had even a telephone in the bathroom, it was tastefully furnished. We had a very romantic stay although only for a night. I highly recommed this place! Although a breakfast is not included we were recommended a lovely cafeteria at the corner of the street and had the most delicious breakfast with latte and mouthwatering crossants for only 6 euros per two people!

<Content>A perfect retreat in bustling Florence Fellow travellers rate this hotel highly and they are spot-on. This was one of the highlights of our 2-month trip in italy. We stayed for 9 nights in the Junior Suite (Iris) on the top floor, which is extremely private - like having your own apartment! We barely heard another guest in the Residence, even though at one stage during our stay the place was completely full. It had two very large windows overlooking a divine garden and with views of the hills surrounding Florence. Inside it is incredibly spacious, clean and well-appointed. The bed is comfortable and the bathroom is huge and lovely with skylights and good ventilation. The kitchenette is incredibly handy if, like us, you are sick of eating in retsaurants after so long away. Angela will give you a recommendation for a local Rosticceria near Piazza Ferrucci which has quite an amazing array of wonderful hot and cold foods, incredible wine and friendly staff.The Residence is located on the Oltrarno side of Florence and is perfect as a cool, green retreat from the centro storico (historical centre), which can get searingly hot in the summer months and is brim-full of tourists. (There is good reason that the Pitti Palace and Boboli gradens were built in this location - even in a time when tourists were more scarce!) The Residence is essentially an old family villa in an aristocratic, garden-filled part of the city and a very comfortable walking distance from pretty much all major attractions. Less than 10 minutes walk to the Ponte Vecchio along the river and easy enough to get a cab back from town (about 5-7 euro) if you need it. The Residence is also, as others have explained, close to the major viewpoint over Florence (Piazzale Michelangelo) - but don't stop here - go to the monastery at the top of the hill for the ultimate views of the city and surrounds. In our opinion Oltrarno also has the best restaurants and nightlife - check out La Beppa Fioraia and Osteria Antica Mescita San Niccolo. The San Niccolo junction is a hotspot for young Florentines on weekends.The jewels in the crown of Residence Michelangiolo are the owners Angela and Cherubino who, true to their names, are angelic and cherubic! They made sure we had everything we needed for a reasonably lengthy stay. They also have somewhat of a sixth sense about privacy - they were there when we needed them and not when we didn't. They live mostly off-site (readily contactable if needed) and you are given your own keys to the villa. Reception hours are till 6pm, but they were often there much later. On our second-last night they surprised us with a lovely chilled bottle of Prosecco and a platter of strawberries with lemon and sugar (as a gift for our 10th anniversary which we celebrated while there).For those of you who are on a working holiday the internet connection here is fantatsic and Angela seems to be able to get any computer to work. There is also a desk and lamp - plenty of room to spread out etc. If you have a car then this is a brilliant location as you can park in the villa's secure carpark and you need not get into the labyrinth of tiny one-way streets in Florence.All-in-all an amazing place in an amazing location with amazing owners and staff. We cannot recommend the Residence Michelangiolo highly enough - they deserve the No.1 spot on tripadvisor. Ciao!PS: A little-known highlight of Florence is the Corrodoio Vasariano - the ancient and private Medici skyway leading from the Uffizi gallery, across the Ponte Vecchio and popping out in the grotto at the Boboli Gardens. It can only be visited with a guide but is well worth the cost. Check out Florenceart.com for tickets.

<Content>Good, slightly out of town hotel This hotel is in a beautiful building on a wide tree lined avenue and a pleasant 20 minutes walk from central Florence. We stayed twice, on our way to and from Greve in Tuscany. On arrival we were told we had been upgraded as all of the standard rooms were full and we were shown to a beautiful room on the first floor with lovely views, a large bathroom and plenty of room for our 2 year old to run about. It was very peaceful, you would hardly know you were just outside a busy city. On the way back we had a standard room just off of the reception area on the ground floor. I would definitely advise paying a little extra for superior room, or at least request not on the ground floor if you go to bed early (which with an energetic toddler in tow we do!) as we found it very noisy until around 10pm, with people coming and going from reception. Aside from this, the room was comfortable and again there was plenty of room for the three of us. I would say this hotel is a good value option, very friendly and perfect with kids due to the large rooms and kitchen facilities.

<Content>Loved the Residence Michelangiolo We had a wonderful stay at the Residence Michelangiolo for three days in May. What a charming hotel! Our room on the first floor was very large and comfortable and even included a completely furnished kitchen in a cabinet. The grounds are green and beautiful and secure parking is available on-site.The hotel's location is ideal, located on a tree-lined boulevard on the green side of the Arno, but with easy access to the important sites of Florence either by walking or by bus. The bus stop is only a block away from the hotel.Angela greeted us warmly and was a wonderful hostess, giving us great information for local restaurants, etc. and making reservations for us as needed.We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Florence.

<Content>Fantastic! Had a great stay in Michelangiolo Residence. The location was perfect as it allowed us to have a lovely walk along the river everyday into the city and also to get away from the crowds of tourists in the centre. Being slightly out of town meant that the restaurants and cafes we went to were more local, authentic places and less touristy. In addition, Angela and Cherubino could not have been more welcoming and helpful and really did make our stay thoroughly enjoyable. They really went the extra mile and even put a bottle of wine in our room on my husband's birthday. The room itself was lovely - very big, clean and with a kitchen which was invaluable for feeding our 8 month old baby. We would absolutely recommend this hotel and if we ever return to Florence we would definitely stay there.

<Content>Surpassed even highest expectations There is not enough space available to adequately rave about our stay at the Residence Michelangiolo. The area is beautiful, slightly apart from the center of Florence, yet so convenient to the bus line that it was perfect. Our room and its view of the countryside literally brought tears to my eyes, and the hosts, especially, were amazing. I fell and severely injured my ankle on a Sunday, a time when nothing was open to get crutches. Angela drove miles to obtain a pair for me and accepted nothing in return but our thanks. Our trip to Italy included Rome and Venice, but our stay in Florence, due in part to our positive experience at Michelangiolo, was the highlight of an amazing holiday.

<Content>All that you could expect and more We booked this hotel based on what we read in Trip Advisor.All the superlatives were fully justified. The location is perfect, far enought from the bustle, near enough to get anywhere in central Florence in 15 minutes by public transport..The owners are very friendly and helpful.The room is huge, confortable and very clean.The free parking on the grounds is very convenient as parking in Florence is very dificult and expensive.

<Content>Great Location We Visited Florence in April on our way to a wedding near Arezzo. This was our first trip to Italy and what a Beautiful, Clean, welcoming country. We will definately return some day.The Hotel we booked we found on a website.(www.booking.com) When we arrived we were greeted by the Hotel owner Angela who was very friendly and went into detail about the hotel, the surrounding area, and the transport links and how to use them. The room was great, with air con and heating (as we went early in the year it did get a little chilly in the evening) T Shirts during the day.Location was purfect, we had a 10 minute walk to the viewing area, which looks over the centre of florence, it was breathtaking. From here you can walk down and into the centre.The Owners of the hotel told us of a small white church hidden just around the corner from the viewing area. It was beautiful.We were sad when we had to leave, we got our maps out for the next leg of our Journey and the Hotel owners helped us with our map reading, we were able to find our next destination with no problems.We can highly recomend this hotel, it was a wonderful stay in a truly mesmerising place. Florence is somewhere everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime.

<Content>We will go back ! We spent one week at the residence Michelangiolo, and are extremely pleased. It's an antique house with a nice garden, silence all around, well furbished inside, cozy comfortable rooms, some of them have a small kitchen, which helped us a lot with our daughter. Good service. The kindness of the owners has also made our staying very pleasurable and easy. Very well and fast connected to any central historical areas of Florence. I recommend it also to families. Reasonable prices, as those of a bed and breakfast, but with an hotel service, so very convenient. We will return to the Residence next trip to Florence!

<Content>A wonderful haven Over the past few years we have discovered some splendid places to stay, courtesy of TripAdvisor, but Residence Michelangiolo tops the list, in terms of quality and value.Even before we arrived, the charming and helpful hosts Angela and Cherubino were already working on our behalf 鈥?booking reservations for museums and galleries, thus saving us much time queuing. It was through them that we found out about the stunning frescoes of the Brancacci Chapel in Santa Maria del Carmine, which we may well have otherwise missed.The Residence Michelangiolo is a beautiful, quiet haven, situated in a smart neighbourhood a short walk or easy bus ride from the main sites, but a welcome distance from the crowds and noise of the city centre. Our suite, which included a beautiful spacious bathroom, was extremely comfortable and elegant - reminiscent of a set from 鈥淭he Marriage of Figaro鈥? and overlooked the garden, an old church and hills beyond.A basket of provisions, cold drinks, milk and ground coffee were replenished daily and provided a simple breakfast. But the fridge, hob and utensils in the small kitchenette gave more scope, if required. Angela recommended a couple of family-run restaurants a few minutes walk from the Residence, that were extremely good value, without skimping on quality. You must try the Osso Buco at the Trattoria L'Orologio!On our last day our kind hosts allowed us to leave our luggage at the desk, after checking out, and to pick it up in the late afternoon before taking a taxi to the station. We left reluctantly and look forward to staying here again on our next trip to Florence.

<Content>Amazing Service and Hospitality From the moment we arrived, Angela helped us feel welcome. She was more than willing to help with any questions we had. Her recommendations for dinner were perfect. We had our two best overall meals in Italy using her recommendations. She even printed off directions to get to an obscure place in Florence I was wanting to visit. Every time we arrived or left the hotel she went the extra mile to make sure we had everything we needed. I've never had service like that at a hotel before.We stayed here for four nights. The room was really clean and pretty large by European standards. The view out of the balcony was very nice. The house is in a very nice neighborhood with many nice restaurants and shops nearby.I have a bad back and the bed did not agitate my back at all. The bathroom was nice, but the shower is definitely on the small side. Many people have commented on the location of the hotel. I thought the walk or bus ride to and from the old town was scenic and very enjoyable. More than that, though, I found the area around Piazza Ferucci where the hotel is to be much more authentic Italian than the old town. There were not many tourists over there and the service at restaurants and shops was much friendlier and warmer than what we encountered in the old town. If you stay here, definitely eat pizza at Gattabuia. It's the best pizza I've ever had. We even found a salami/cheese store near the hotel where the owner gave us about seven different cheese samples free. It's that kind of service and hospitality that makes a trip truly memorable for me.

<Content>Everything was great! Staff was friendly and helpful. Fun to stay in an old villa. Convenient to have a closet kitchenette. Appreciated the large room and huge bathroom w/ tub. We especially enjoyed our dinner at the nearby Trattoria Gigi restaurant. Good location from which to take the following interesting long walk on the south side of the Arno River: Piazza Michelangelo (overlook view), Chiesa di Miniato al Monte (church), Fort Belvedere, Boboli Gardens/Pitti Palace, and walk back along the Arno River.

<Content>A wonderful place to stay We had a wonderful stay. The villa is out of the hustle, bustle and crowds of Firenze: but not too far. The room was huge by italian standards and everything inside was done beautifully. The only minor criticism we had was that our room, on the ground floor, got some entrance hall noise.

<Content>Very pleasant stay We booked a superior room for 120 Eur/night - reasonable value, esp with free parking, which is otherwise expensive in Florence. Very spacious and comfortable. Good kingsize bed, desk, chair, armchair, small dining table and chairs. Kitchenette with basic electric hotplates, sink, fridge, equipment. Breakfast basket of sweet packaged breads and rolls not very appetising. Ordinary bread would have been better. Very quiet location, walking distance to centre (about 20-30 mins). No staffing after hours, no hotel amenities, but this suited us fine. City bus nearby. Very nice staff.

<Content>A little paradise My wife and myself stayed there for four nights in February. The place is magnificent, spotless, comfortable etc. A little paradise! The people in charge, appropriately named Angela and Cherubino, are very kind and helpful. One welcome difference with Paradise is that you can choose to walk to the centre of Florence in ten minutes (leaving your car safely parked inside the Residence) or go for a drive round beautiful Tuscany.

<Content>Fantastic My wife and I stayed at this hotel for four nights earlier this month. As the reviews say, its a wonderful hotel, our room was lovely and the owners extremely friendly and helpful. The first time we visited Florence was in October 2007, on honeymoon, when we stayed at the Savoy - we liked Residence Michelangiolo much more.It is about a twenty minute walk into the centre of town, but don't let that put you off, its through lovely scenery; in any case there is lots to see and lots of great places to eat nearby.Would definitely recommend.

<Content>Delightful This is a great hotel. The service is wonderful with a very accomodating staff. The rooms are spotless, quiet, and well decorated. On the negative side we would have preferred to be closer to the city center. It is about a 20 - 30 min. walk to the city depending on where you are going. There is a bus stop nearby, but we never used it. Also, as with many hotels in Italy, the shower is very small. I was glad I am a small person. However, I would not necessarily let these issues stop you from staying at this hotel. It is a very good value for the service and room we received. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>La Dolce Vita This place is simply wonderful, unless you want a lot of excitement. It is a 1920s house converted to a hotel of sorts but really it is a house a 15 minute walk from the hubbub of Florence, which can be too much at times. If you crave quiet and civility this is the place for you. The rooms are charming and homey. If you want the services of a boring business five star hotel, please don't stay here. Save the place for those of us who love life and aren't spoiled brats!

<Content>Highly Recommended. We stayed at the residence and would highly recommend it. Angela and Cherubin, our hosts, were extremely helpful and friendly. We had no troubles and the residence is spacious, clean, warm in all senses of the word, and very welcoming. We travelled as a family of 4 adults (parents and 2 university aged children) and had adjoining apartments which were more than adequate for our needs. The residence supplied everything we needed and more - internet assistance, language assistance, directions, maps, restaurant recommendations and bookings etc. Absolutely wonderful. Highly recommended for maturer guests, maybe not young childen as it is quite a walk (15-20 mins) to the city and restaurant areas. We enjoyed the walks after great food and service as recommended by our wonderful hosts.

<Content>Beautiful, Quiet Villa with Lovely Owners We stayed at this charming villa in late November 2007 and absolutely loved it. Our room was spacious, beautifully appointed, quiet, and full of sunshine. It had a large, deep bathtub which was perfect for a hot, relaxing soak after a long day of site seeing. We also appreciated the mini frig stocked with free beverages and the speedy Internet access.The villa is situated in a lovely, tree-lined neighborhood just a 10 minute walk to many of the city's main attractions and is near numerous yummy restaurants, cafes, bakeries, delis, markets, and a self-service laundry mat. The owners were extremely friendly and helpful. Prior to our departure, Angela gave us a tour of some of the other rooms including those with kitchenettes. All of them were large and immaculate with tasteful, comfortable decor. My partner and I have traveled quite extensively and this is by far one of the best places we've stayed.

<Content>Cute place not too far from the city centre (Lovely People) We stayed at the Residence Michelangiolo in the amazingly Beautiful Florence Italy at the start of December 2007.This place is just a bus ride from the central train station and once you arrive there it is a beautifuly large house with great surrounds. The reception that we received when we got there and during our stay was amazing (any question was answered and always with a friendly face).The rooms are the largest in Europe and have a great kitchenette.Make sure you stroll up to the chruch on the hill (This churche was very old and had a mystique about it (We have already seen most of the major churches throughout Europe), where you can also see a copy of Michaelangelo's David in Copper. Amazing site seeing place of all of Florence (this view is not too be missed!). It only takes under 10 minutes to get there by foot (The pizza for 3 Euros below the chruch was fantastic).If you need to get into the city centre, the best thing to do is grab the bus from the Restaurant just up the road and than stop at any of the major tourist spots. Truely is an amazing city.Thanks again Residence Michelangiolo for a great stay in Florence (We will be back!). Too many more things to see and there is not a better place to stay in Florence.All the best for 2008, Peter Mathey

<Content>Great hotel in Florence This was a great find in Florence and my wife and I rate it as the best hotel of our honeymoon. The room was quite large and had it's own mini-kitchen. The shower was a bit on the small side, but we expected such. The location is a bit of a walk from the center of Florence, but bus service was readily available and the walk was actually quite nice after dinner. What really made this hotel shine was the staff. The provided dinner recommendations, directions, mailed postcards, the list goes on and on. I have rarely seen such level of service at any hotel. We would highly recommend this hotel based on the staff alone.

<Content>Beautiful, historic building with great staff I booked the Residence Michelangelo after reading on TripAdvisor and wasn't sure what to expect. The arrival instructions were great-we got a taxi from the station as it was pouring with rain but the bus would have been almost as quick and stops 200yards away.The welcome was warm and the room was spacious,clean and well equipped with a useful little kitchenette topped up every day with fresh breakfast supplies.The Residence is on the far side of the River Arno from the tourist sites which means a 20min walk or a short bus/taxi rise but it also means a peaceful sanctuary from all the hustle and bustle-we went in November and it was still busy.The staff helped with restaurant bookings and recommendations and were great in every way-thoroughly recommend this place!

<Content>An ideal Florence hotel An ideal location, offering free parking in the garden surrounding the villino that houses the hotel, close to public transportation, and with quite good restaurants and shopping nearby. Spacious room, with almost 5 meter ceiling, and an adequate and extremely welcome kitchenette, and a comfortable king-size bed. Internet connection, too.The staff is very pleasant, accommodating, and helpful, and Angela is a charming and well-informed hostess. We''ll surely book with them again, and strongly recommend Residence Michelangiolo.A presto!

<Content>Great Hotel, great location For months before my wife and I went to Italy, with Florence being our first stop, I went on to Tripadvisor.com and read many reviews of many hotels in Florence. I booked some, then canceled when I read a negative review. But, when I came across the Residence Michelangiolo and saw not one negative review, I knew this was the place. It is located in a residence built in 1917 in a residential area a 15 minute walk to the Ponte Vecchio. Angela and Cherubino run the Residence and are very helpful with telling you about restaurants, bars, where to get bus tickets, and which bus to take into the main tourist attractions across the Arno river. Bus #23 which runs every 10 minutes, takes you right to the Duomo in less than 10 minutes. Cherubino even took me to his gym for a workout, but, I left my ID at the hotel. The hotel is easy to get to from the train station. Just take the #23 bus to Piazza Ferruci get off, then walk 5 minutes to the Residence Michelangiolo. All in all, a wonderful experience in a wonderful city. We will be back! Marc and Barbara Popkin Los Angeles , Calif

<Content>Fantastic hosts, great rooms and lovely ambience The location was perfect for us because we walked or used the buses or cabs, however it is on the other side of the river and a couple of km from the centre of town.The property was exceptional - a lovely big room, high ceiling, airy and with a view onto the back garden. Everything reported about Angela and her partner is true - knowledgeable, firendly and welcoming. We stayed five nights and could have stayed a month.The local restaurents were great fun, relaxed, not full of tourists and good value. If you have a car the location and parking facilities are ideal.A really great experience.

<Content>Lovely hotel My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Residence Michelangiolo (RM). We arrived at the Florence (Firenze) train station. Took bus to stop about a block from RMWalked up a slight hill for about one block. Not hard, even with our roll along luggage. We were in a quiet tree lined area. Sort of like our fancier Philadelphia suburbs. Found walled in attractive Mansion. People gate and car gates. Walked through people gate, through parking area to main door way. Good security. Met at desk by Angela. She spoke good English. She's very pleasant, energetic and efficient. She seems to run the place.Took modern elevator to our room. The room was attractive, large with a high ceiling. Bathroom was modern and spacious. Bed was large. Everything was clean. Windows had large shutters that you can open to let in the air. Couldn't test the air conditioner as we arrived in early October and the weather was balmy. Not hot and not cold, just right. We liked our roomAfter we unpacked and put our valuables in the room safe, we left the room This time we walked down from our second floor room. The stairway is very nice and is well decorated. We asked for advice from Angela on how to get to the Accademia. She told us where to catch the bus. After a pleasant ride along the Arno River, we were near the Accademia. We spent a day at the museums and went back to RM. Angela recommended a restaurant about 3 blocks away (Gigi). Her advice was good and we enjoyed the restaurant. Stopped at a nearby green grocer and bought some fruit. Back in the room, our purchases went into the refrigerator for tomorrow's morning repast. The refrigerator was stocked with bottled water (with and without gas), fruit juices, etc. Took a shower in the shower/tub combo. A little tricky using the hand shower device as no shower curtain. Slept well on the very comfortable bed. Didn't have my laptop with me so couldn't check on internet service. But Angela let me use her computer so I could access my email.We spent three nights at RM and enjoyed it immensely. My only suggestion for improvement would be the addition of a small Mr. Coffee type device in the room We opted for a room without a kitchenette to save money.Side advice. Make sure you have your reservations to the Uffizi and Accademia before you go to Florence. Without reservations, the lines are huge. Long line at the Duomo if you want to walk to the top of the Dome. We didn't and line was short. Don't miss other less crowed museums: Opera (in back of the Duomo), Bargello, and Pitti Palace. Original Ghiberti's door panels are at the first two. Only copies at the Baptistery (outdoors, crowded and fenced in).

<Content>Great little hotel This was the perfect place to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary.Angela was a gem, even arranging for flowers for the room and a perfect dinner reservation near the Ponte Vecchio. The room was largewith wonderful, high ceilings. We walked to the center of town and the sights or took the local bus. The inside the gates parking for our car was a real plus.

<Content>A True Gem Our 10 day stay in Firenze was enhanced significantly by the exceptional service and wonderful room at this beautifully restored villa.Angela and Cherubino were the perfect hosts, assisting us with everything from finding our luggage, making reservations at quality local restaurants, booking private driver tours, and making us feel like highly valued guests with their warm smiles and positive can do approach.Our room was very spacious with high ceilings and included a small kitchenette, a large and very comfortable bed, 4 chairs, and a modern bath in spotless condition. Given nice weather with cool breezes at night, we slept with the huge windows open in spite of a fair amount of traffic noise from the busy viale out front. With all windows shut and the air conditioning on, it's very quiet, so you have a choice.We both enjoy walking and as others have pointed out it's only 15-20 minutes from most downtown sites, and less than 5 minutes to the local coffee shop. We will return here for sure.

<Content>Excellent base for visiting Florence The Residence is in a quiet position within a 20-30 minute stroll to the centre of Florence, with good bus routes if needed. The room was beautiful, large and clean with a very large and comfortable bed. The hosts were excellent and very helpful with suggestions and directions. We had the breakfast basket included in our rate for the room and this was a good way to start the day. Excellent value for money, would certainly recommend the Residence and was definitely stay there again if we return to Florence

<Content>A home in Florence As we arrived after a long car trip Angela was awaiting us. She immediately showed us to our room and gave us quick and thorough instructions. We were able to relax in a spacious, cozy and spotless room with no delay. Later on she directed us to a neighborhood restaurant that captured the soul of Tuscany. We did not have to use our car during our stay since there is a minibus that takes you to the Ponte Vecchio within a block from the hotel and gets there in a few minutes.Overall a VERY pleasant stay with fantastic personal service from Angela and her associates...always available.We would love to go back over and over!

<Content>Great Find in Florence The Residence is a unique property with excellent hosts. The property is well situated just outside of the historic district. Just far enough outside the tourist district to enjoy alternative venues yet walk to anything. The hosts arranged everything necessary and provided great recommendations for food and sites. The property is a converted villa that provides all the amenities that Western travelers expect, with a flavor of a home, rather than a hotel. My wife and I highly recommend the Residence and would stay there again. We can only say that of two of the five hotels in our journey (the rest being average), the other being Villa D' Este in Lake Como. Peter  Nicole McElroy

<Content>stay in Florence we are back from a trip to Florence where we stayed four nights at the residence michelangelio - the house is very pretty and the rooms are fine and comfortable - we regret one thing : the breakfast - we had in our room a basketwith several industrial viennoiseries that didn't taste very good - in such a place we would appreciat e a freshly cooked breakfast with fresh coffee , fresh bread... -it did not suit the quality of the house - pity!

<Content>Perfect Oasis Residence Michelangiolo is a fantastic oasis of calm close to the bussle of Florence. It is within a few minutes walk of the Ponte Vecchio and all the major attractions.The rooms themselves are spacious, with the added benefit of beautiful high ceilings, increasing the feeling of space. The reception from the owners is second to none, and indeed thay could teach many an establishment a thing or two about customer service. It was faultless. We arrived hours before check-in time and without having to ask, Angela (owner) offered us the use to the residence's car parking facilities. She also completed the paper work for check-in, allowing us to head into town and wonder around for a few hours, before we returned to take occupancy of our room. While checking in Angela noticed that one of us was celebrating a birthday that day. Without any hesitation she recommended and booked a nice restaurant for us for that evening. When we finally took ownership f the room there was a lovely Happy Birthday note on the table a bottle of bubbles cooling in the fridge. It was a very nice touch. In summary, I would highly recommend the Residence Michelangiolo to anyone thinking of visiting Florence. It is in an ieal location, has parking facilities, the rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean and the owners are amoung thte nice and friendliest people you could wish to meet.We stayed two nights and would have absolutely no hesitation in returning to the Residence Michelangiolo over and over again.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We had a wonderful stay at the Residence Michelangiolo at the end of September. We arrived at night in a driving rain storm and had to call for directions. They were wonderful and we made it safe and sound. We felt as if we were staying at home of a friend who would leave the light on for us to return at night. It was great to have parking for our car in a locked area as we needed it to travel but we never took it out of the parking lot as we walked all over Florence. There are some wonderful restaurants in the few block surrounding the hotel and a great spot to have coffee in the morning before heading into Florence right on the corner. It is a 15 to 20 minute walk into Florence but you don't even notice it as you are walking along the river and looking at the views. I picked this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and was not disappointed.

<Content>Excellent value at Residence Michelangiolo Residence Michelangiolo is an excellent choice for your stay in Florence. Owner Angela was helpful in every way we requested. Her property is beautifully remodelled and in a quiet location. The hotel is about a 25 minute walk to Ponte Vecchio or an easy quick bus ride. The kitchenette was nicely stocked with coffee, water and juices and the room was very attractive. It was about the best value for the money as anywhere we stayed in Italy. Two small inconveniences - We would have liked screens on the windows because mosquitos are still active in Sept. The shower could have used a curtain; we were in the wheel-chair accessible room. We definitely recommend Residence Michelangiolo. It's a classy spot away from the hub-bub of the city center.

<Content>Perfecto A gem. Immaculate. Gracious hospitality. We were here for our honeymoon, and felt we were coming home each day to a palace in a lovely and quiet neighborhood, a comfort exceeded only by the warm and genuinely kind staff. I shall always remember the kindness of the staff. They are perfectionists. The rooms have lovely names. We stayed in Primulo, a large double superior, with very high ceilings and a kitchenette. The room is on the second floor and faces the street (a good 20 yards away, at least), and absolutely all street noise (not that much to begin with) and light is blocked out by the double windows and double shutters. We loved Florence and Michelangiolo so much we decided to extend our stay, and with good luck had the chance to stay a few more days in Michelangiolo, in Iris, a junior suite on the third floor (the only room on the third floor), with 2 windows facing the back garden, a kitchenette, a long bathtub in the bathroom, and still high ceilings and a gorgeous and very clean wood floor. The bathrooms in both rooms were beyond immaculate, with beautiful fixtures and appliances. Also--the sheets are very, very nice. High thread count sateen striped, bright and clean. The rooms on the first floor, in the back, walk out to a lovely garden. Each room has a special feature. All are fabulous; I had a chance to peek in a few rooms while going down the stairs, as a large cleaning team worked in vacated rooms. There is an elevator that accesses both the second and third floor (also a staircase and additional entrance to the third floor room).If you have a chance, take a walk up Viale Michelangelo to the top of the hill. The walk, and the view, are both superb. Angela--Grazie, and best of luck to you. You deserve all the best. --M., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA

<Content>Wonderful place! My husband and I went to Italy on our honeymoon. We had a wonderful time in Florence at the Residence Michelangiolo. Our room was clean, full of light, tastefully decorated and it had a kitchenette that the hotel staff filled every day with water, juice, milk and pastries. Angela, the hotel owner, took really good care of us. She was extremely helpful with restaurant recommendations and tours. The residence is located in a residential area that is just beautiful. We loved staying there and would be happy to recommend it everyone. The hotel's website is also very helpful and the pictures are accurate. We just hope to be able to stay there soon again!

<Content>Grand boutique We love boutique hotels and Residence Michelangiolo was no exception . The staff were extremely friendly  helpful. The grounds and room were spacious, private, clean and well maintained. Parking is easy on the grounds. Although located outside the old city its still a nice walk to all attractions.

<Content>A Quiet Escape After a Busy Day My wife and I spent 3 nights at Residence Michelangiolo and we had a wonderful stay. The location is within 10 minute walking distance into the city or there is a convenient bus stop nearby with a good place to grab a cappucino when buying your bus ticket. In busy Florence, one might appreciate the location of this BB. The room was large, clean and quiet. The bed was comfortable and the bathrooms were beautifully tiled and we had plenty of hot water. Our unit had a small kitchen where one could enjoy a light (provided) breakfast or walk to a nearby market and prepare their own meals. The beautiful garden is also a charming place to relax after a busy day. I would highly consider this Residence when looking for a room in Florence and I would return there in the future. Thanks, Angela for the wonderful room and I really learned how to make my own expresso while staying there!

<Content>Outstanding hotel We were a family of 8, so we had two adjoining rooms on the first floor, which actually made it apartment like. We had the kitchenette in one room, and a balcony outside these rooms. Other members of our family shared an apartment upstairs. One of the bathrooms was the biggest that I have seen in Europe. Everything about this hotel is ourstanding. The only problem that we had, is that 2 people in our party had problems walking. So we had to take the bus into town. With the summer schedule, the buses were not frequent. I've been to Florence several times. This hotel has been the best!!! Don't be afraid to stay here. This is an ideal place for honeymooners.

<Content>friendly owners and lovely rooms My Partner and I stayed at the Residence Michelangelo for two nights at the end of July. It was a little difficult to navigate around Florence (thank god for Tom Tom). When we arrived the owners were very helpful and hospitable and following their guidance we went to the Museum Academia first to see the David. It is about a 15 minute walk to the Ponte de vechio and the town centre or it鈥檚 easy to catcha bus on the Corner. The owners kindly tried to book us an advance ticket to the Uffizi but we had left it too late. The Museum is closed on a Monday so we were there for it opening on the Tuesday andhad to do the usual 2 hour queue. So tip is to book in advance a few weeks before you go. Florence was wonderful to wander the streets andsoak up the atmosphere as well as see the museums.The room we had was large, airy and comfortable and the ensuite bathroom was lovely. The room had a little kitchenette area provided with a fridge, sink, and tea and coffee facilities. Breakfast was a selection of pre wrapped pastries and jams which was a little disappointing but as a residence the owner explained they were not allowed to serve breakfast as they would then be re-classed as a hotel. In order to stay at a Hotel of this standard you would pay substantially more. This accommodation was convenient, welcoming, attractive and excellent value for money. I would highly recommend itand would happily stay there again

<Content>Believe the reviews. Fabulous hotel, exactly as most of these reviews say. The ajoining rooms making up the apartment are just perfect for a family of 4. The quality of service provided by Angela is outstanding - we had had our money and credit cards stolen at Pisa Airport so the trip was not off to the best of starts (!) but on arriving at Residence Michelangiolo, Angela was incredibly helpful. She phoned the police and the airport on our behalf and even lent us some money until we had made other arrangements. That is what you call service. Oh, and she also recommends great restaurants - 'The Golden View' right next to Ponte Vecchio is touristy but good food and 'Rifrullo' slightly away from tourists, mainly locals in when we went and great food. Thank you Angela and your husband, for turning a near disastrous start into a lovely 2 day stay at the beginning of our Tuscan tour. A gem of a hotel.Just everyone beware pickpockets at Pisa Airport (and also the incredibly unhelpful airport police)!!

<Content>great stay We loved the Residence michelangolio! The owners were so friendly and the triple room we stayed in was big, which is hard to find in Europe. It was out of the city, which was kind of nice to be able to get away from the crowds to relax. It is an easy walk to the main places to see and the many museums that are there. The hotel owners made us reservations to the main museums which really saved us time by not having to stand in long lines!We would definetly stay there again if we get the opportunity!

<Content>Will return to the residence michelangiolo We stayed for three nights in residence michelangiolo in Florence and loved this residence. It's located on viale michelangelo which is a gorgeous treelined long street running from the river up to the famous lookout point - piazzale michelangelo. The residence is at the bottom of this street, close to the river. There is a walk to the main attractions, about fifteen minutes, or a short bus ride on the no 23 which goes from very near to the residence into the main areas like the duomo. We mainly got the bus or taxis which were cheap enough, but just to save our energy for all the walking when in the centre. This was our second time in Florence and we loved staying here as you had space, comfort and really tasteful italian decor. We also had a kitchen where they gave us a basket of snacks, coffee and tea which was great to come back to. There was also a terrace to sit out in. The rooms were nice and big, as was the bathroom. The bathroom had a bath, which I think is pretty unique for Florence, there wasn't a hook to put the shower on but it didn't bother us. We found the reception staff really helpful and they answered any of our questions, booked us taxis, recommended local restaurants and gave us info about the touristy stuff. They also have free internet access if you need it. As for Florence, if you haven't been before, I'd definitely recommend going to aqua al 2 for dinner (i think another reviewer mentioned it before, have the balsamic steak but ring ahead to reserve), make sure to book the ufizi gallery beforehand with a tour company as queues would put you off, don't buy icecream in the shop at the corner of the piazza della signoria (it cost 12 euro for one cone!), go up to piazzale michelangelo for the view and then up to the church of san miniato there (maybe go there to hear the monks singing at five thirty in the summer, four thirty in winter), also go on the open top bus cause one of the routes brings you out to fiesole which has lovely views too.

<Content>A warm welcome and a fabulous room We've just returned from a few days in Florence, where we spent two nights at the Residence Michelangiolo. We highly recommend staying here if you are visiting Florence. It's a beautiful building with fantastic rooms in a great location, just far enough from the crowds but easy walking distance to the centre of town. It's not a hotel, so don't expect room service, gym access etc., but the setting, the rooms and, most importantly, the warm welcome from the owners make it so much more enjoyable a place to stay than some faceless hotel. We will definitely be returning to Florence and will be staying at the Residence Michelangiolo.

<Content>Great place to see Florence from A great place to stay as several others have said.Angela  her husband are great hosts. Very helpful, eager to ensure you have a good stay, rightfully proud of Florence  the area.I have to disagree with SkiingTourist below. This is a Residence, which means you do NOT get meals. Having said that, Angela does provide very basic croissants, cakes  fruit juices etc. for you to eat if you want. We did not pay anything additional for cleaning?A great location as well - quiet but easy access into the centre, (via Bus #23). Nice little cafe  Trattorias close by as well. A short walk to the Pallazo Michelangelo, complete with it's stunning views  sunsets over Florence.If/when we go back - we'll definitely stay there again!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We stayed at the Residence Michelangiolo for 2 nights, but wished it had been for longer. It is a beautiful hotel. The room we had was on the ground floor, with a terrace. The room was very large and was decorated to a very high standard. It also had a kitchen area, very cleverly concealed within a wardrobe.Angela and her husband were very friendly and helpful, suggesting places to visit.. We even managed to see La Traviata on their recommendation.Hotel very handy for all of Florence's sites.When we return to Florence, we will definately stay at The Residence, and would highly recommend it.

<Content>fantastic in every respect My husband and I stayed at the Residence Michelangiolo for two nights in July 2007. The hotel is located off the tourist track, away from the crowds and the noise, but there are two busses that go into the heart of Florence, one of which is direct and gets you there in minutes. In cooler weather, it's a beautiful 10-minute walk across the Arne.The building and the grounds are beautiful, a true ode to Florence, with ornate stone and iron work and large gardens cooled by shade trees. The room we stayed in was large, with high ceilings, an ornate bed, windows that opened wide to overlook the garden, and a generous bathroom. The decor was simple, but perfect: the bed as centerpiece, a sparse white table flanked by two white chairs poised in front of the grand windows.There is also a kichenette, tucked efficiently into a double-doored cupboard.Because the hotel is small, it's very personal. Even though we stayed for only two days, we felt we were good friends with Angela and her husband by the time we left. If we had questions, they were eager to find the answers. Also, they know the best (i.e. non-tourist) restaurants, sites, etc. that you will never find in any guidebook.  The only cloud on the horizon was the breakfast that came with the room. . It was a basket of pre-packaged foods, not at all representative of the irresistibly yummy pastries that Florence offers.( No worries, though, because just down the street is the best caffe that we found in Florence. It's the locals' hangout, and for good reason).To sum up, the Michelangiolo is fantastico, and we would highly recommend it to anyone.

<Content>A lovely place My wife and I booked our April long weekend stay at Residence Michelangiolo after reading all the positive reviews here on the TripAdvisor website and we were not disappointed. The villa is located in a leafy area on the edge of town and yet close enough to walk (15 minutes or so) to the centre of Florence.The room we stayed in was clean and spacious and had a small table for two should we have chosen to have our morning coffee there. Incidentally, each room has coffee making facilities and a small fridge which is stocked daily with bottled water which is free to use.The staff were very friendly providing us with tips as to the various attractions to visit in Florence as well as suggesting various restaurants around Florence. We can definitely recommend one of the restaurants that is literally 2 blocks down - authentic Italian cooking and mostly frequented by locals (closed on Saturday nights and Sundays, so obviously not surviving off the tourist trade).Our stay at Residence Michelangiolo certainly enhanced our experience of Florence and we can definitely recommend it!

<Content>Nice place to stay The Residence Michalangiolo has fantastic rooms, and is run by the nicest freindliest people you could hope to meet. It is easy walking distance to the centre of Florence or there is a great inexpensive bus service.As there is no restarant and bar if you are hoping to meet other guests this hotel is not for you, but with a hotplate and fridge cleverly hidden in the room it is great if you want to do your own thing. You can drink your own drinks on a terrace or in the garden.

<Content>Outstanding Property My wife and I along with our 2 teenage sons lodged at the Residence Michelangiolo for 2 nights after spending time at a B  B in Bangno a Ripoli. The property is situated in a residential area approximately 15 minutes by foot from the center of Florence. The proprety is meticulously maintained with parking behind a secure gated fence. We did not use our automobile during our stay. The rooms were large, immaculate and well furnished. We looked forward to returning to our airconditioned and comfortable rooms each afternoon after spending long hot days in the City. Our host, Angela provided us with recommendations for dinner at restaurants within walking distance of the residence which were reasonable in price and quite good as to quality. We enjoyed walking around the vicinity of the property after dinner. Residence Michelangiolo is truly a jewel.

<Content>Idyllic hotel - Residence Michelangiolo We had a wonderful stay at the Residence Michelangiolo and were warmly welcomed and pampered by Angela and her husband. The residence is situated only a very short distance from all the major attractions of Florence, in a leafy residential avenue near to public transport or a 20min walk into the centre.The beautiful rooms are large, well equipped and are furnished and decorated to a very high standard maintaining period features. No expense has been spared on the quality of fittings and finishings in the lovely and spacious en-suite bathrooms. Each room has a mini kitchenette hidden within a large cupboard complete with refrigerator, hob, microwave, crockery, wine glasses, etc. Each day the kitchenette is restocked with fresh coffee, tea, milk, juices, bottled water and light breakfast snacks.It was lovely to return to the hotel after a tiring day in Florence and enjoy a glass of wine in the attractive gardens.Another major plus was being able to park the car within the secure grounds of the residence.We have stayed in many wonderful hotels in the past but Residence Michelangiolo is without doubt the best, and most welcoming that we have experienced.

<Content>We loved Residence Michelangiolo We stayed at the Residence Michelangiolo in late June. This was trulyhome away from home for us a family of four with two children. The location is ideal in an upscale tree lined neighborhood just 15 minutes comfortable walk from the city center or a 5-minute bus ride.If you arrive by car you will greatly appreciate the free secured parking.The property is charming and extremely well kept with all the modern amenities. We stayed in a beautiful sutie on the second floor. The kitchenette was fully stocked with water, juice and snacks and all available at no additional charge. Angela was always pleasant and available to assist including making museum reservations for us.We have traveled extensively throughout Europe and Residence Michelangiolo ranks as one of the best places we have ever stayed in Europe in terms of location, amenities, condition of property and rooms, and overall value. This was a great find for us via Tripadvisor.

<Content>Wonderful stay I had selected to stay in this hotel after looking at trip advisor reviews and I am glad to have chosen this. Even before we made the trip, Angela was extremely helpful and very prompt in replying to my emails. When we went to check in, Angela came out to welcome us and take us to our suite. The place was immaculate and my wife and my son loved it. The place was quite close to the main attractions (The Duomo, Accademia etc was a few minutes by bus which comes very close to the hotel at Piazza Ferucci). The built in kitchenette was very nice. After a busy day visiting the Pitti Palace etc, we bought a few things and my wife made a simple dinner using the kitchenette and we had a enjoyable dinner watching TV (the room provides 2) and playing cards at night. I did not have the right adapter for charging my video camera and I was able to get it from the front desk. When I was leaving for Rome, I asked Angela whether I could buy the adapter from her and she gave it to us for free. Agreed, the adapter might not have been too expensive but I appreciate the intention of the hostess to make life for the traveller as comfortable as possible. We had paid around 200 euros per night for this suite but I think it is worth it. I always wanted to strike a balance between the comforts the hotel offers and the price (one may think why stay in an expensive place when most of the time is spent outside the hotel). But I think that after a busy day going around Florence, it is indeed very comfortable and relaxing to spend the night at this place. I also value cleanliness very much and I would gladly recommend this place for visitors to Florence.

<Content>lovely home away from home We travelled to Italy with our three children (aged 13, 10 and 5) for the first time. This hotel was a lovely oasis away from the commotion and noise of Florence. We had two rooms, each unusually large by European standards. One room came equipped with a kitchenette and kitchen table with four chairs. (We also had a roll-away cot for my daughter. This room was really enormous!) This came in handy in the morning. We would walk to the local store to purchase frest breakfast items and enjoy them in our room before heading out on our busy day. The room rates were extremely reasonable however breakfast was not included. The rooms themselves were big and bright with huge renovated bathrooms, however there are only bathtubs, no showers. The hotel is air conditioned and was able to keep up during the heat wave that we experienced during our stay.The hotel was originally a house, so the hotel is small and intimate. The rooms, instead of room numbers have room names, continuing the concept that these rooms have character and charm. The couple that runs the hotel is friendly, helpful and always there to offer any assistance that they can. We enjoyed coming back to our rooms at the end of a long day to recharge our batteries in the tranquility of the hotel grounds.The only problem we encountered was the location was a little far from the main sights. Located on the other side of the Arno River, it is a fifteen to twenty minute walk to the main area. Although a nice walk in the morning, it was long for our children who were tired of walking first thing in the morning. Although there is a bus stop only a block away from the hotel, it was confusing to figure the buses out and they were not running all that often. We often took the bus home at the end of the day to save our children the walk back.If the location is not an issue for you, I highly reccommend this hotel for anyone looking for something a little different. We would definitely return when our children are a little older!

<Content>So Sorry to Leave!!! My wife and I have just returned from 3 wonderful nights at Residence Michelangiolo.We were in Florence for our 30th wedding anniversary and stayed in the Margherita room on the ground floor which was of a very high standard.Angela and Cherubino were excellent hosts who made our stay so memorable.On returning from a day in Florence we were presented with wine, chocolates and flowers, which were much appreciated. We found the location perfect for relaxing after a long hot day in central Florence, the room having excellent air conditioning and access via French Windows to the large garden. In the morning the only sounds we heard was that of song birds鈥?.what a way to wake up in a busy city!!Our only disappointment was that we only booked 3 nights!!! Not to worry though, when we return we won鈥檛 make that mistake again!

<Content>The Best Hotel in Florence This hotel is a gem! It is across the river from all of the hysteria and hoards of tourists, so although you are 5 minutes away from the Ponte Vecchio and all the attractions by bus - you feel like you are staying out in the country. The rooms are large - our room had a bedroom, kitchen and terrace as well as a big bathroom. Angela, who runs the hotel, will treat you like her family. Anything you need to know or anything you need - she is there for you.The air conditioning actually works and gets as cold as you need it to (which I found very unusual throughout Italy).The place is spotless. It is a little hidden paradise.If you are going to Florence don't stay anywhere else!

<Content>Great Place for Families We really enjoyed our stay at the Residence Michelangiolo! We stayed five nights with our family of four in the two bedroom apartment on the first floor. We had plenty of room and really enjoyed the walkout terrace. We even cooked dinner one night using the kitchenette and the food we purchased at the mercato and little stores near the Residence. It was a nice break from all the eating out. There was a really good pizza place near the hotel that we went to a couple of times too. The property was a bit out of the center - a good 20 minute walk or so. We ended up taking the bus or a taxi which was fairly reasonable and easy to do. We liked being out of the noisy, hustle and bustle and were glad to be able to park our car easily and for free. We visited Siena, San Gimingnano and Pisa from this location with no problem.Our best dinner in Florence was at Aqua al Due in the center. You need a reservation if you would like to go there. Order the Steak with Aceto Balsamico. It was fantastic. Also the Assagio of Insalata and Assagio of Pasta is great too.Our stay was really relaxing and comfortable here at the Residence Michelangiolo. I would recommend it highly for families with children and anyone else.

<Content>Perfect for a short stay in Florence Staying at this Florentine villa was part of our 2 week honeymoon trip around Italy and, out of 4 different hotels we stayed in, Residence Michelangiolo scored 10/10 for comfort, cleanliness and overall home-from-home feeling. I think maybe the home-from-home statement stems from the fact that you actually feel like you are the only people there, even though you're not! Our room was on the first floor overlooking the garden and our bathroom was huge! We hardly heard a sound from anywhere else. The bathroom and bedroom windows open up fully which is perfect when it's a hot sunny day like it was when we were there second weekend in June. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the daily replenished breakfast basket and soft drinks were very welcome. Because Angela and Cherubino knew it was our honeymoon, we arrived back from our first day of sightseeing to find a chilled bottle of Prosecco in the fridge with some gorgeous chocolates which was a wonderful surprise. I poured myself a bath and soaked my sore feet whilst sipping the fizz and nibbling the chocs! How perfect! The other memory I have is, the smell of the olive trees outside when the windows are open....I smelt this more at Residence Michelangiolo than I did later at our Chianti villa surrounded by them...weird but extremely wonderful! Our hosts happily agreed to keep hold of our bags on the day we checked out until late afternoon when we were leaving, so we could have a final explore of Florence. Although this villa is not in the centre, so it may be slightly further to walk than a city centre hotel, this is most definitely a plus. We met some friends at our next Villa and they were staying at The Savoy right in the heart and they said it was noisy, smelly (of horses...) and much too hot. They would have much preferred to stay where we were. All in all a fantastic experience at this house and I would recommend to everyone. Make sure you visit Boboli gardens too, really special place.

<Content>Fantastic Michelgiolo! Our family of four stayed for 3 nights in June 2007 and found the hotel and accommodations to be wonderful. We booked two adjoining rooms on the first floor which had French doors leading out to a charming patio and garden. The rooms were a good size and very nicelydecorated. One room had a small kitchenette. Breakfast was a basket of store bought individually wrapped cakes, croissants, and jams of the type that you'd find at a convenience store. There were also coffee and tea packets. Bottled water, juice and milk boxes in the refrigerator were replenished daily at no cost and were greatly appreciated. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk to the downtown area mostly following the Arno River. Across the nearest bridge on the opposite side of the river from the hotel, heading away from town is a good grass path for running or walking. It's very peaceful in the morning.We tried taking the bus once into town (during rush hour). Even though the bus was packed, the driver kept letting more people on. It became suffocatingly claustrophobic, so we walked from then on. Perhaps it is different at other times of day.Our host Angela was wonderful and recommended some excellent restaurants. She also helped us book tickets to the Ufizzi gallery and the Accademia where we saw the sublime Statue of David. Note: These should be booked at least a month in advance (especially for the superlative Ufizzi) You'll pat yourself on the back for your foresight when you see the lines of people without reservations.Florence is beautiful, fun, crowded, chaotic, and noisy. There is a constant sea of young people racing madly by on scooters. I wish it had been just a little quieter at night but I have a feeling that silence is hard to come by at any hotel in Florence. I also wish thatthe breakfast selection was a bit more fresh and expansive. There aresome nice shops within a few blocks to buy yogurt, cereals fresh baked goods and fruit. The overall experience was so pleasant though that these wish list items seem trifling. The accommodations and our host Angela were marvelous. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Residence Michelangiolo to anyone.

<Content>Owner Handled Situation Very Well We booked two nights at the Residence Michelangiolo, but upon arriving were told that there was a water leak in our room. The owner was very kind and had already booked a larger room down the street for us (at the same rate). He also had a bottle of champagne sent to the room for the inconvenience. We didn't get to stay at this location, but were very pleased with the way he handled the situation, and look forward to staying here in the future. He made what could have been a nerve-wracking situation, absolutely seamless.

<Content>Chic boutique experience. Lovely. Gorgeous place a short walk from all the attractions. Felt like we were staying in an embassy, very grand building, beautifully restored. Lovely welcoming hosts who allowed us to treat the place as our own. Nice array of good restaurant (non-touristy) recommendations available in reception. One small detail - we were in the ground floor room and it can be noisy when people are to-ing and fro-ing in the morning. When we go back (which we would most certainly do) we'll ask for a room upstairs. Highly recommended overall. Thank you Angela!

<Content>Lovely place, great proprietors All of the great reviews are true. Our family of 4 stayed in two wonderful, unusually large rooms, one of which had its own courtyard patio. It is located a bit off the beaten path in a quiet shaded neighborhood across the river, but still only a 20-minute walk or easy 5 minute bus ride into the heart of Florence. It is run by a charming couple who were extremely friendly, helpful and solicitous. There is no breakfast, but this was a minor inconvenience at this thoroughly charming and lovely place.

<Content>What a lovely place! Me and my wife stayed here on a long weekend in Florence and we both loved Residence Michelangiolo. The staff was very friendly and forthcoming. We had a ground floor double room with a kitchen, a large bathroom and a terrace towards the back of the building, facing the gardens. The room was immaculate and the kitchen was well equipped and even came with free breakfast basket that was replenished every day. The residence is a pleasant 10-15 minute walk along the river from the hustle and bustle of the centre of the city. I would highly recommend this residence to both adults and families with young children. The gardens are well fenced off with a gate and hence young children can run freely around.Very good value for money!RegardsRagnar

<Content>Great Hotel in Florence Date: June 8, 2007 LyndaLosALtosMy husband and I were here first for 5 nights and then for our last night on our way out of Tuscany. The best place we have stayed in Italy! The rooms are beautiful and Angela is a great hostess. The bus stop is just down the street, next to the cafe where we had our morning cappuccino and rolls.The rooms were also supplied with coffee, milk, juice and rolls too if we wanted them. But again, the rooms were very large and gorgeous. We would recommend to anyone!

<Content>Residence Michelangiolo: "A Tranquil Stay" This was a welcome respite from the normal hotel experience. It was great to have a cool, spacious room, in a lovely setting, including a charming garden area. You really couldn't ask for more. Off the beaten path, but that too was a welcome relief from the crowds and bustle of downtown Florence. You get the best of both worlds. And, Angela, is the added gem!

<Content>I'll be back! A delightful, quiet getaway that is a perfect complement to this beautiful city. My teenage daughter and I stayed for 3 nights in early June 2007. I debated between this hotel and another in town, and am so glad I picked Residence Michelangiolo. Angela and Cherubino were delightful hosts (attentive but not intrusive). I had seen a couple of complaints about the pre-packaged breakfast offerings in prior reviews on this site, which I considered a minor issue in light of the fridge and kitchenette in the room and a convenient bakery/cafe 3 minutes walk at the bottom of the road. We had a few false starts on finding the right bus stop to get into town -- then a breeze. And the walk is doable, if you have the time. The room was huge, clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated. Other tips: (1) bring packable slippers if you don't like walking on the (lovely) tile floor ; (2) consider taking a taxi from the train station, which is easier than figuring out the bus for the first time (we paid about 12 euros); (3) get a map which shows where the right buses pick up in town. I highly recommend this hotel and hope to return someday.

<Content>Nice, quiet stay for our honeymoon! We chose this hotel to stay for our honeymoon. We are really happy with our choice! It's a quiet property and makes you feel like you are a part of history because you are staying in a large, historic villa. It's close to the bus stop and a 20 minute walk to the Duomo and other sights. The owners are very pleasant and go out of their way to make reservations for you, give you train schedules, leave bottle water in the room, and make your stay comfortable--they even gave us a bottle of champagne for our honeymoon!! There is no restaurant in the hotel so we walked to Cafe Michelangelo which was just 5 minutes away and also where the bus-stop is. The one thing that was a bit difficult was that there was no shower curtain in the bathroom which made it difficult to take a shower without getting water everywhere. But we got used to it after a day or so. Also keep in mind that the reception desk is only open until about 6-7 pm so people cannot call you later than that. We would definitely recommend Michelangelo!

<Content>Expectations surpassed My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at Residence Michelangiolo May 1 through 5 2007. Although we expected a pleasant stay based on TA reviews, this beautiful villa exceeded our expectations. Our second floor room(106) was lovely, spacious and spotlessly clean. After full days of sightseeing and walking all over Florence, it was great to come home to this quiet setting. The property is nicely landscaped and well maintained. It is also gated. It's just a good stretch of the legs to Ponte Vecchio and points beyond. Uphill from the residence, it's a fairly easy walk to Piazzale Michelangelo, which we did at night. Closer is Piazza Ferrucci with restaurants, shops and a great take-out rotisserie place which we really enjoyed. We took their food with a couple of bottles of Chianti back to the room...heaven! Angela reserved times for us at the Accademia and Uffizi Gallery which no doubt saved hours of our time. All should take advantage of this service. If and when we return to Florence, Residence Michelangiolo would absolutely be our first choice.

<Content>A great Place in Florence This is a magical place about 15-20 minute walk from the ponte vecchia(there is a bus that goes from the center to one block away every ten minutes). I usually like to stay in town but this is an exception. It is a quiet and peaceful setting located on the Viale Michelangelo, with it own grounds.It has a wonder garden and some of the rooms have terraces.Angela and Cherubino are the owners and your host. They are available to help you, book restaurants, make suggestions and help you in whatever way they can. You don't find this kind of hospitality reeadily in many places.They do not serve breakfast but you have a kitchen to make it if you like or you can go to the nearby cafe and have a cafe and morning pastry as the Italians do.Book early as I think this is a winner.

<Content>Not impressed at first...but.... We booked our 3 night trip at this hotel to celebrate our first wedding anniversary, based on tripadvisor comments. When booking we asked for a superior room with a garden view. When we arrived, we had to part with our money straight away before being shown to our room and this left us feeling quite uncomfortable - especially as when we were showed to our room on the first floor, we were not at all impressed. The room was certainly large but was quite dark and dingy with little furniture and the smallest bathroom. The window opened overlooking the carpark - not the garden like we asked. (one thing that nobody on tripadvisor said was that this residence is a matter of meters away from a very busy and very noisy main road). My husband and I were both very disappointed and asked if we could move to another room. They said the only other room available was the one on the ground floor next to reception so would be busy and noiser when people came home late at night and checked out in the morning. As this was our only option and as we had already paid, we moved to this room (101). This was a better room, with a space outside where we could sit in the moring having breakfast (albeit a very noisy breakfast due to the volume of traffic on the road nearby). These patio space also overlook the owners house which is next door to the residence. The gardens are not really gardens at all - just a little bit of grass really. The bathroom was so small that you could just about get in and close the door. It is true that the hospitality here is wonderful - Angela recommended resturants for us, booked it for us and ordered us taxis and made us feel very welcome. They even left us a bottle of wine and some glasses and chocolates on our last night with a congratulations on your anniversary note. By the end of our stay, the negative experience we had on arrival had pretty much disappared and we felt that we had made the right choice by staying here.

<Content>Wonderful experience at the Residence Michelangiolo We had the incredible experience of staying at the residence Michelangiolo in Florence, Italy to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. A wonderfully restored villa very near to the many attractions in Florence it offered everything one could hope for in an Italian vacation. Impecably clean and extremely well appointed you felt as though you had the opportunity to stay in a rare property. Both my husband and I are seasoned business travelers having traveled to Italy and Europe on numerous occasions. I must say that our expectations were exceded. Our plans took us to various cities and winerys around Florence and our hosts were available to prepare maps, make reservations and provide advice daily. On our 4th night the owners ( inn-keepers )surprised our foursome with a celebratory bottle of champagne and chocolates. The property is surrounded with lovely gardens and a beautiful private car park that makes staying there a pleasure. None of these amenities had any additional charge! I would highly recommend a stay at the residence Michelangiolo. I doubt you would find a more pleasurable stay in Florence and one that leaves you feeling you could not have experienced a more memorable Italian experience.

<Content>Wonderful ! After reading all the wonderful reviews on tripadvisor , we stayed at the Residence Michelangiolo for 4 nights in April and we are so happy about our decision.Our room was bright and clean . Very spacious and well decorated. We had a small sitting area outside our room which gave us good sense of space. The bathroom was small but very clean . Angela later informed us that they had some rooms with larger bathrooms - so do ask for one while bookingThe location is nice and peaceful and it's a pleasure to return to the calm surroundings after a day of hectic sight seeing. it's a 15-20 minute walk to the centreBoth Angela and Cherubiano were very sweet and helpful. Their hospitality was much more genuine and warmer than that of regular hotel staff. If and when we go back to Florence , we will look forward to staying at their lovely home again.One Tip - Avoid restaurant Cibreo as it is super expensive and not at all worth the money for either food or ambience - highly over rated !

<Content>Best of both Worlds We are getting married in Florence this October, and visited the city recently to confirm final arrangements, staying at Residence Michelanglo. Throughout our stay, the residence's owners were always on hand to ensure our stay was a pleasant one, offering friendly advice when asked. The residence benefits from a exceptionally quiet and secluded location, set back from the Piazza Michelanglo, however is only a 10/15 minute stroll along the banks of the River Arno from the Pointe Vecchio and the city centre. The rooms are well appointed,airy and bright. As a result of our thoroughly positive experience, many of our guests will be staying there for our wedding.

<Content>Serene and Welcoming From our first contact with Angela at Residence Michelangiolo the feeling was always one of warm welcome. The thoughtful attention to every detail is a kind and gracious gift for each guest here. From the spacious, spotless and serene room to the glorious gardens, from the surprise of sparkling wine for our anniversary to the friendly and helpful service, this place gives you a warm and happy benvenuto!

<Content>Loved Residence Michelangiolo We stayed at the Residence Michelangiolo in April and i am very pleased we did.The room was large, clean and stunning as were the gardens, the building.Angela the owner was helpful and a plesure to stay in her home. Its in a quieter area but still very central. The location for us was right as we like to walk. It is a nice walk I would say 15 mins to the main attractions of Florence.However if you would like to stay near the hotel some of the attractions and the best cafes, restaurants and bars are only 5 mins walk away and Angela would be happy to advise on their locations. A couple of travellers tips we flew into PISA and this was fine you pay 7 euros and get a bus 1 hour to Florence don't get a taxi from Pisa its very expenisve. Also try and walk to places in Florence, its a safe freindly city, get a map and familarise yourself with the areas in daylight and you will be fine. Taxis again are expensive. Also try the Trattorias as they are the best value and deliciuos food.Finally i would say we had a wonderful stay in this beautiful accomdation with wonderful hosts and if you like to explore and be in the relaxing part of town with everything at your fingertips, come and stay here, We hope to return one day

<Content>We loved this place. Our family had a wonderful stay at the Residence Michelangiolo. The house was beautiful, our rooms were fantastic, large, spotlessly clean and super comfortable. We could walk to everything, plus we had the convenience of being able to park our rented car, enabling us to take day trips to the countryside during our stay. Our 14 year old daughter felt like a princess. She had her own room and facilities and I think that the cost was worth every euro, even at the disadvantage of the dollar exchange rate. Angela and Cherubino were warm and welcoming. Angela helped us with every plan and, truthfully, we all felt very at home. Staying at the Residence Michelangelo enhanced our visit to Florence because we always had a refuge of classic taste and comfort after long days of sightseeing. I would recommend Residence Michelangiolo for a long-term stay because it is so convenient to all of the other sights in Tuscany. After a day of driving through the winding roads of the Chianti region, we took the highway and were back to the hotel (from San Gemignano) in approx. 20 minutes. In sum, Michelangiolo was perfect for us.

<Content>A Beautiful Hotel with Fantastic Service A beautiful hotel with fantastic service from the owners who were both very attentive and ensured that our stay was a pleasant one. Residence Michelangiolo is within easy walking distance of the town centre where there are many good restaurants. The breakfast bar in the room was adequate, however it would be much nicer if fresh bread and better quality fruit juice and conserves could be provided instead of the long life stuff.

<Content>Excellent Location and Superb Service Me and my Wife spent our honeymoon here and right from the start, we got a 5 star welcome by Angela.Not all hotels come to greet you at the door, but Angela did.First of all, I feel I have to say that this isn't a hotel as the english would know hotels, for example you won't get a fried breakfast. What you are actually getting is a huge room with your own cooking facilities and a few breakfast snacks, tea and coffe making facilities.Angela made sure we got cabs whenever we needed them and also provided us with anything we asked.You also get free internet while you're there, that can cost 20 euros a night elsewhere.It was a perfect place for us to base our days out to Siena and Pisa, Viareggio and San Gimignano from also. Angela gave us superb maps and directions, just watch out for the maniac italian drivers!We also left a bottle of champagne out of the fridge, when we came back, we found 2 champagne glasses and a note from Angela, saying Congratulations on your Honeymoon and all the best, which was a nice touch.All in all, you can't beat this for value and service, it gets top marks from me, and I don't give that too easily.If I could give one bit of advice, and it is tiny on the scale of things, it would be that 2 pillows on each side of the bed would be better and also an electric kettle could be good.But don't get me wrong, this was a 5 star service we got and we will almost definitely be going back.RegardsPaul  Pernille Ross

<Content>The Perfect Honeymoon! What an absolutely delightful place to spend our honeymoon. We arrived to a warm welcome and much appreciated assistance tracking down our luggage which apparently fell into a black hole in Milano. Our room was enormous and the bed very comfortable. We really appreciated the kitchenette. Everything was clean, comfortable and lovely. And, even in January, Florence was beautiful... with very few tourists. The hotel's location was perfect for walking into town... close enough to be convenient, far away enough to feel like we deserved that wonderful chocolate dessert. after dinnerAngela and Cherubino were wonderful to us the entire time. They recommended the best restaurants you could imagine (everything they say about Italian food is true...amazing!) Be sure to get Angela's suggestions. She won't lead you astray. She even stood in the middle of the street blocking traffic so we could make a left turn out of the front gate. (Don't drive in Italy if you are timid.) We would be delighted to stay at Residence Michelangiolo the next time we are in Firenze!! You will be very happy if you stay there. In fact, sitting here looking back on it all, we want to go back for our first anniversary! (or sooner).Cynthia and Al Dale

<Content>Tuscan Charm and Hospitality What a Treat it was to stay here; I was on a Special trip with my Parents and This truely was our home away from home. Our hosts Angela and Caribeno were Warm;Friendly and very helpful. the setting is beautiful on a tree lined street ; the Villa is beautifully renovated and was quite confortable to stay in. We had 2 rooms on the ground floor that both had nice kitchenettes that really came in handy . My room opened up onto the back patio area which was just lovely. I travel a lot for work and I loved it here, it was such a peaceful setting you would never guess it was so close to the center of town. If your not hung up on being in the center of town I highly recomend this place. It`s a quick 5 min Taxi ride to the center or walkable in 15 mins.

<Content>Great value - with kitchenette The Residence Michelangiolo is a great value. We had a very large room with 16 foot ceilings and windows looking out on the backyard. Our room had a little kitchen corner that was stocked with all the basics (including coffee, some snacks, and milk and drinks in the refridgerator).The staff was very warm and welcoming.They were even kind enough to let us leave are bags in their office for the day after we checked out (as we were taking a late night train out of Florence).The only thing to note is the location from the city center. It is a pleasant 15 minute walk to the ponte vecchio - but, from the train station, I would recommend a cab (10 euros).

<Content>Home Away from Home My wife and I arrived on March 17 and were warmly greeted by Angela. We were very impressed with the large spacious room with a 14 ft ceiling, two large windows that opened, and a balcony with a beautiful view. Angela was always helpful with getting museum tickets, restaurant recommendations and ordering taxis. We enjoyed being able to check our emails with a computer set up for that purpose.We selected this hotel because of the tripadvisor reviews and were very happy with this small hotel and the price. It is a Tuscan villa in a beautiful neighborhood with restaurants and shops nearby. My wife intends to return with her sister and to stay at this same place--definitely a home away from home.

<Content>48 hours in Firenze This hotel is highly regarded on tripadvisor and this is why we were happy to secure a booking for a late March weekend. We had a very large and pleasant room on the 1st floor with a kitchen in a cupboard, a table for 2, a nice wide bed and a bathroom with lots of towels. The location is great, in walking distance of the city center, with a bus stop nearby, should you have sore feet. It was a memorable stay from beginning to end and surely we will come again!

<Content>Classic Gateway to Firenze and Tuscany My wife and I wanted our stay in Florence and Tuscany to be a special one, and we were absolutely delighted with the wonderful Residence Michelangiolo. Our host, Angela, was extremely helpful in providing directions and hospitality. The Michelangiolo is a perfectly charming Hotel situated in a very peaceful and beautiful section of Florence. It is a few short blocks to bus stops and a taxi station, as well as family cafes and an expresso shop, which also has a nice selection of local food and wines. It is a casual walk along the river to the historic center of the city, and a short drive further up the hill on Viale Michelangiolo allows one to experience a marvelous view of the Florence skyline. It is a short 40 minute drive from the hotel to the fascinating village of San Gimignano, a small walled medieval hilltop town. The hotel thus served as a focal point for visiting numerous charming villages in Tuscany. My wife and I loved our stay and look forward to returning to Florence, Tuscany and the Residence Michelangiolo.

<Content>Absolutely first class We stayed at Residence Michelangiolo from February 25-27 recently. There were 4 of us, 3 adults and one child aged 10. We stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment which has an adjoining door.When we arrived in the taxi Angela, the manager, was there to greet us with a friendly welcome.From the moment we arrived the service was fantastic and our rooms were massive and spotless. Lots of fluffy white towels and beautiful rooms, high ceilings, tastefully decorated. Took us approximately 20 mins to walk into Florence but taxis were cheap also.Would thoroughly recommend staying here, I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Florence.

<Content>Superb, friendly, grand without being pretentious. Great for the kids We visited in Feb half term 2007. Stayed for 5 nights - wish it could have been longer.We arrived by train from Pisa and asked the taxi driver for the Hotel Michealangelo and wasted 10 Euros being taken to the wrong place - the Starhotel Michaelangelo( I think) so just make sure you have the correct address in writing and handy before you get in the cab. Our mistake, we should have realised there may be more than one hotel in the area with that name!!!!The other hotel phoned ahead and spoke to Angela who confirmed our booking and a new taxi was ordered and got us there without much delay.A great welcome from Angela who helped us with great info on where to catch buses and where to buy tickets and anything else we wanted.We found eating out a little tricky and a costly experience with 2 kids aged 6 and 9 who, although not fussy eaters at home, found some of the local dishes a little unusual so the kitchen in the cupboard was a great bonus as we cooked pasta back in our room to keep them happy.We had two adjoining rooms on the first floor which were both fabulous and spotlessly clean The kids room had twin beds and ours, a king -size was very comfy( and I am very fussy when it comes to a comfy bed to sleep in!!) with crisp white sheets. The huge bathroom in our room was palacial, with the biggest bath I ever seen. The only drawback was the lack of shower curtain, as in many continental hotels, which leads to wet and potentially slippy floors but we were just careful not to splash too much!! The breakfast more than adequate and we were regularly topped up with bottled water and friut juices in our little fridge.This really is a beautiful place to stay and although a little more expensive than some of the city centre hotels you do get what you pay for and it is in my opinion worth the money. You are paying for a little haven of peace and quite in the evening and I imagine that in the summer the garden rooms would be a joy. The free internet access is also a bonus - we took the laptop and researched the train times which turned out to be crucial for a sunday morning journey to connect with the plane. We would stay here again without hesitation.

<Content>Lovely Romantic Weekend Break Myself and my boyfriend, (couple late 20's) stayed in this accomodation in late February. We arrived very late, 1:00am and Angela welcomed us with a bright and enthusiastic welcome. The room was fabulous and created a real period setting. There was a stand alone bath with a shower hose attached however this was not ideal for boys who don't do baths, we stayed in the junior suite and so this may not be thecase with other rooms. The location was a queit exclusive area, 20 minutes from the centre and we walked by Piazalle MIchelangelo on the way. This was an excellent start to our trip.I would have no hesitation in recommending this residence to any of my friends visiting Florence.

Our arrival was not great - we had flown for many hours to Milan, then a train down to Florence - we were exhausted - and the young woman who runs the hotel immediately had me sign up for full payment on my credit card before even seeing the room. When I realised what I'd done, about 30 minutes later, I felt very disturbed and unhappy. I felt I'd been rail-roaded into something, which was not nice, expecially as the internet booking site said I'd pay at the end of the stay.And our first room, though large and clean, was not thrilling, in that it faced the main road. Not a very busy main road, except at peak traffic times, but noisy for someone who comes from a very quiet corner of New Zealand. And the bathroom was the usual tiny Italian hotel bathroom with a hand-held shower.So we started our stay not very happy. But the young woman, who is actually very charming, but has a very direct, no nonsense manner, managed to switch us, on day three, to a room facing the back garden - smaller, but quiet, gorgeous and with the most wonderful huge bathroom, a five star hotel bathroom, so that made us happy. The hotel is immaculate and there's always free bottled water in the refrigerator, and you can make your own cups of tea in the little kitchenette.For a traditional hotel breakfast, you have to wander down to the nice little cafe down the road. You can also do your laundry at the small laundrette, and experience ordinary Italian life, away from the tourist hot house of down town Florence, which is a twenty minute walk away, along the river. Or two minutes in the frequent buses.For a week's stay, this place was wonderful. We were in a quiet neighbourhood, away from the bustle, but close to all the galleries and restaurants. And it was so quiet, we only encountered other guests twice.

<Content>Luxury, peace and chill My wife and I stayed at Residence Michelangiolo for 4 nights in the last week of October. We had just driven down from London with one stop to deliver things for our daughter who is studying art nearby. The parking was very convenient and safe, and enabled us to do day trips. The walk to the Ponte Vecchio is 10 minutes flat walk by the river and is lovely. Also, local buses and taxis are available to travel all over Florence - forget trying to drive around town.Our hosts Angela and Kerbino were charming and very helpful and always around when we needed them. We loved our stylish room - top of the building - big with large comfortable bed, great bathroom and lovely views over the garden. The cupboard kitchenette approach is brilliant and all that we required! Being able to sleep in with no concience to take breakfast was much more healthy. In any case, it encouraged us to try the best of Florence food and wine for the evening! Coffee bars and cafe are just round the corner.Its high rating is well deserved despite its high price, but it should not be mistaken for a full service hotel. For us, it is even better than the best Florence Hotels, if you want to really chill and relax!

<Content>An Absolute Gem My wife and 10 month old son spent 5 nights at Residence Michelangiolo in late November and we could not have enjoyed it more. It was perfect for us... a beautifully restored villa by Angela and Kerbino (spelling?), beautiful room with 25 foot ceilings, beautiful bathroom, kitchnette hidden in an armoir, wonderful caring and helpful service from Angela and Kerbino... not intrusive at all. This is not a full service hotel but a beautifully restored villa which is a 15 minute walk from the center of Florence. It is very economical and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a wonderful Florence experience that is NOT in a full service hotel. We would go back in a heartbeat. Thanks Angela and Kerbino for making our stay so enjoyable!!

<Content>Loved Residence Michelangiolo We stayed for 2 nights at the Residence Michelangiolo in Florence Italy. We wish it could have been longer. Our host and hostess, the owners, were wonderful.. We were 4 adults and we booked a superior apartment. This consisted of 2 separate rooms, each with its own bathrrom. There was also a tiny kitchen. The rooms we very clean and spacious. The owners helped us setup our laptop and were so accomodating. They offered advice as to where to go in Florence. They were so warm and welcoming. The location was great. It was very quiet and not in a touristy area, yet close enough to walk to the main sites in Florence (maybe 1 mile). The rate was the best we paid in Italy, $600 USD for all 4 of us for both nights. I highly recommend the Residence Michelangiolo.

<Content>Fabulous in every way! I highly recommend Residence Michelangiolo to anyone travelling to Florence, Italy. There is not a thing I would change about the place. The rooms are beautifully furnished, immaculately clean, and completely stocked with fabulous coffee, cold drinks, pastries (yum!). Residence Michelangiolo is conveniently located within walking distance to everything worth seeing, yet it has a feel of being in the Tuscan countryside, as the gardens are beautiful and the veranda is so peaceful.The service? Amazing--better than I have ever experienced. They helped us in every way possible, from getting our computer online, to making dinner reservations, to ensuring we had the best drivers for our tours, and they made us feel as though we were the only guests there. I was so sad to leave and wanted to bring our new friends home with us! I look forward to seeing them again. I will always stay at Residence Michelangiolo when I travel to Florence.

<Content>Outstanding rooms, service and location Our daughter studying art history of the Renaissance, we recently spend three days in Florence. I first contacted a hotel I had read about in a Hotels of Charm paperback... full up, but they recommended the Residence Michelangiolo--perhaps recently opened--closeby.Our stay at the Residence Michelangiolo was a delight for everyone. In an elegant turn of the century mansion, our two room apartment accommodations were spacious, beautifully decorated, clean, comfortable and had modern computer connections had we wished to use them. Our car was in security within the parking area of the garden inside the property.Tthe welcome and service were excellent. The location was superb, high on a hill overlooking Florence, but within walking distance of the center. There was also a bus just a short walk away that we used once and taxis--low rates-- which we used a couple times in the evening. We forgot a couple souvenirs which the residence has mailed to us very graciously.

<Content>a fantadtic Spot A gem of a place to stay in Florence. It's about a 20 minute walk from the centre of town (Ponte Vecchio, etc) but the bus (very regular) takes you there in 2 minutes. I found the location great : easy to walk into the centre but just far enoughtto be away from the bustle of florence crowds. Very nice little local cafe just beside it too (cafe 4 3 I think) and a couple of bars populated mostly by youthful locals.The rooms are beautifully decorated, very spacious (much bigger than hotel rooms) and spotlessly clean and the bathroom facilitiess are top notch.There' s also a discreetly hidden away kitchenette that actually proves very handy; glasses, plates, fridge, kettle, cooker, coffee, tea, etc.The two girls who seem to run/own the place are extremely pleasant and helpful, and lend the place amuch more personal touch than in a conventional hotel.Very good value also, when compared to hotels in florence. I'd highly recommend.

<Content>You need look no further It seems almost inconsequential to add to the already ecstatic reviews of this hotel save to say that the odd minor criticism which some folks have included to try and add some balance to their review are really irrelevant - the Michelangelio is as close to perfection as you could reasonably find.The most surprising thing is that you get the impression that you are the first person to occupy the hotel and yet there is no smell of new paint. I don't know how they do this. Given that it many respects this hotel is quite hi-tech I think they use some nano-tech paint which automatically covers over any scuffs or dirty fingerprints.Joking aside, you will not be disappointed with this hotel nor with Florence generally - the weather was crisp and sunny during our visit.A couple of words of advice for the first-time visitor - make sure you get a bus map and also find out where to catch the bus near the hotel - it is not at all obvious. And do make the effort to visit Pisa (use the autostrada) and Siena (use the back roads through Chianti country).Our only regret - we didn't a restaurant which was half as good as the hotel!

<Content>HEAVEN!!! LOVELY VILLA RUNS BY TWO ANGELS!! WOW!! I recently stayed at this beautiful villa/hotel with my senior parents for their 50th wedding anniversary. At first I was worry about the location since it's outside of the MAIN TOURIST AREA. But don't you worry, you're better off!! This villa is only about 15 minutes walk to all the main tourist area, and there are buses down the street that take you 5 minutes to the DUOMO and all the tourist area. You can park your car in their safe, gated lot so you don't have to worry about driving since you can't drive to the centre anyway. It's also only about 2 minutes drive to the beautiful piazzale Michelangelo and San Miniato Church. They are two must see places that overlooks the whole Florence City!! And driving from the villa to the Chianti areas and Siena is so convient too, just check with Angela and Curabino with the best directions!! They are two ANGELS!! BEAUTIFUL ANGELS that take care of all your needs, more than any concierge service you would get from any 5 stars hotels which we stayed later on our trip. And we stayed at some pretty highend hotels such as the Hotel de la ville in Rome, Carlton hotel in Cannes and Le Grand Hotel in Paris. When we first arrived, they greeted us with wonderful smiles. And the rooms were huge, high ceiling, spotless, warmly coloured, beautifully decorred and did I say SPOTLESS!! There's also a hidden kitchen area which you can make your own expresso or whatever in the morning. They provide pots and pans, and the cutest expresso maker that makes the best expresso or coffee!! There's also a refrigerator with juices and water provided for free!! There's also a basket full of breakfast treats and candies too for your sweet tooth!! They also have free internet hookup, they have connecting cable and the server is so fast since there are only 11 rooms in the villa!! Not like the big hotel which could be very slow, and did I mention it's FREE!! They also have a conference room in the basement with computer system provided, so if you are travelling with a group or a company. The room is large and private and toilets right outside. Like your own office but better!! This villa looks brand new and they've been opened since Feb 2005. It took three years of loving rennovation and personal touches to make this villa the way it is now. Be sure to look at the book, just ask Angela!! And Angela, her name says it all, she's an ANGEL!!!!! Always has a beautiful smile, ask her anything and she'll get it done for you, and than some!! And her partner Curabino, another Angel that helps with any navigation needs for your day trips or whatever. They are computer geniuses since they used to have a computer shop before running this beautiful, heavenly villa!! By the way, the pictures on any of the websites do not do justice to this villa. You have to see it in person!!! You have to be there, either in the room, or in the grounds, smelling the beautiful fragrant from the surrounding trees!!! They also provided us with a bottle of champange for the special occasion!! They recommended the best little restaurants, and there's also a beautiful spa down the street if you need a little pampering!! This was the best hotel experiences I've ever had and I travelled alot. Both for work and pleasure. And I stay at the high end hotels such as Ritz Carlton, St. Regis, Westin, Park Hyatt to name a few!!! Last but not least, Curabino and Angela led us to the highway to PISA so we wouldn't get lost on the way. Now that's service and with a smile or two!! This villa should be 6 stars if I can give it that. And Angela, the beautiful Angela, a 10plus, and of course Curabino too..... David Wong, San Francisco 415-948-5988 DAVIDLIKWONG@AOL.COM if you have any questions about this villa.

<Content>Amazing Experience The Residence is a joy - a pleasure! The staff is amazing, particularly Angela. She is helpful, friendly and knowledgeable.The rooms are large, as are the bathrooms - the decor is beautiful. The Residence is in a park like setting, landscaped with fruit trees and an herb garden...if your room looks out to the garden your morning view is peaceful and picturesque. The Residence is a 10 to15 minute walk along the Arno to Ponte Vecchio....be prepared to shop. The major museums, including the Galleria where the David is housed is another 10 minute walk. In the evening the Orologio Trattoria is a good dining spot but if you want a great old Florentine restaurant make sure to check out Trattoria Sostanza on Via Porcellana - blink and you will miss it....a wonderful dining experience.Enjoy the beauty of Florence - the hills, the people, the art and of course the Chianti!

<Content>Great start to the holiday We booked the Residence Michelangiolo, wanting to visit Florence but not necessarily to stay right in the centre. This place gave us the perfect option of being out of the hustle and bustle of a city, yet close enough to get there to see it. Can only agree with the other reviewers that the room was excellent, especially as we had the added bonus of a self catering option which came in really handy for an early morning cup of real italian coffee! Angela and co. were exceptionally friendly and welcoming without being intrusive. There is a 20 - 25 min walk to get to the city, restuarants; shops etc. so have comfortale footwear or be prepared to get taxis/buses. Would highly recommend.

<Content>really enjoyed the hotel Michelangiolo This was our first time in Florence. We wanted to experience the city without having to experience the other tourist and traffic. I found this hotel to be exceptional and the staff to be patient and very helpful. This being our first time in Florence, we had many questions, Angela was very patient with us and offered excellent suggestions. The room we stayed in was the first room on the left when entering the residence. We were initially a bit apprehensive wondering if the noise level from the street would wake us up in the morning. Fortunately, that was not the case. The air conditioner worked well and the bed was comfortable enough to allow us to sleep. I am grateful that we stayed at the Residencia Michelangiolo. Angela was great.

<Content>We would give it six stars if we could!! My husband and I just came back from a two week trip to Italy. We stayed at the Residence Michelangiolo for 5 nights. It was hands down the best lodging of our trip. Our room (the Rosa room on the first floor) was beautiful, spacious and clean. It had double doors leading to a shared terrace where we often ate lunch. The property itself is charming with an inviting entry way, backyard and patio area. Our nightly rate didn鈥檛 come with breakfast or a kitchenette. We only had a mini-bar. But, that wasn鈥檛 a problem because there was a caf茅 just a block away. Surprisingly, both the cafe and rotisserie place across the street from it both had some of the best food we had in Italy.The service here is top-notch. When we arrived, our room was not yet ready. So, Angela (I think she and her husband own the villa?) took our luggage in and my husband and I were off to see the city. When we returned, our luggage was already waiting for us in our room. The next day, I stayed in the room sick with the flu. Angela must have noticed that only my husband was leaving and re-entering the hotel. So, she called me to ask if I was OK. She was also very helpful in making various reservations for tours, restaurants and museums. In terms of location, this property is well-situated. It is on Viale Michelangiolo which is a main, busy street but tree-lined and beautiful. It鈥檚 south of the Arno and about a 15-20 minute walk to the city center or a 10 minute bus ride. The bus stop is only two blocks away. Other than Sunday, we never had to wait more than 5 minutes for the bus. I almost want to keep this place a secret. But, I think it鈥檚 getting pretty popular. When I first booked this place several months ago, it was #26 in popularity on Tripadvisor and as I write this review, it is now #8. If you want to stay in the city center, then this place obviously isn鈥檛 for you. However, if you want to see a different side of Florence away from the crowds, reasonably priced and still close to the city center, then look no further.

<Content>perfect The location is great. The room was large and clean. However the best part of the residence was its staff. They went out of their way to make certain that everything was perfect. One day we couldn't find a museum that we were looking for. When we mentioned this to Angela she offered to drive us there. We would recommend the Residence Michelangiolo to everyone.

<Content>Wonderful! We just returned from Italy and unfortunately, only stayed at Residence Michelangiolo for one night. My mother, my cousin and I came to Italy in celebration of my mother's 80th birthday and requested three beds on the ground floor (they do have an elevator). We were given an immaculate ground floor suite which was actually two large connecting bedrooms with high ceilings. Each had double doors to a lovely terrace with a table and chairs (we brought our dessert from the restaurant to enjoy there in the evening). There was a small hidden refrigerator in one room and a hidden kitchenette and breakfast area in the other. Each room had a lovely, clean bath with nice showers. There was a basket of goodies for the morning, juice and coffee to make ourselves (included in the price). There was an electronic gate and space for parking. Angela and a gentleman (sorry, I don't remember his name) were wonderful hosts. I am big on complaining when the service is not perfect. We were tired and grouchy when we arrived but Angela, (much younger than I expected) was very accomodating to our needs. She really gets it when it comes to service. She has done all of the right things, including the rennovations (which I think took three years) and understands the importance of making her guests feel comfortable. They held our luggage the next day and when we returned showed us to the bathroom, called for a cab to the train, helped bring out our luggage and chatted with us while we waited. I would definitely recommend this lovely place and will return again, hopefully next year with my husband!

<Content>Wonderful! My husband and I recently spent 2 nights at this charming hotel. Our room was in the front second floor of this mansion. The home is on a beautiful street with similiar estate homes, directly outside of the city. The room was huge, with high ceilings, clean, bright with beautiful decor. The home is gated with private parking directly in front of the home. The room and bathroom were impecably clean - great bed and air conditioning. I slept very well.  We were greeted by the friendly and attentive Angela, who was very accomodating. Angela provided us with every need for taxi's, directions, museaum tours and even made us reservations to eat at a superb restaurant OPEN BAR. We requested her to help us find a hotel with a view of the Ponte Vecchio. We were so surprised to be seated outside directly facing PV right on the water.We didn't mind the flexibility of making our own coffee. We also had a delightful selection of juices, water and breakfast danishes in our own private fridge, and petite kitchen.We loved this place and would not hesitate to stay again.Oh one last thing, we lost our credit card between this place and Bellagio. When I called Angela from Bellagio, she not only searched the hotel for our card, she called our hotel in Bellagio and gave us updates on the card. We didn't ask her to do that, she is just a wonderful hostess. We would stay here again!

<Content>Our first Anniversary For our first year anniversary we couldn't have chosen a better hotel/residence. The room we stayed in was gorgeous. Very tastefully decorated in a traditional style. The service was excellent. Although there is no breakfst included we were provided with a basket of treats , milk and juices, every morning.The property and the room were immaculate. But the highlight was the large french windows opening up onto a romantic and well cared for garden.We would not hesitate to recommend it!

<Content>Loved the Residence Michelangiolo Everything about the Residence Michelangiolo is wonderful. It's located just across the Arno from downtown Florence, out of the noisy downtown center but close enough to take a short walk to lunch, dinner, shopping, or sight seeing. Angela, the proprietess, speaks excellent English, and is accommodating to all requests. The rooms are clean and comfortable and include a well stocked kitchen with drinks and snacks. For joggers, there is a beautiful trail across the street that continues for several miles to the Piazza Michelangelo, with its fabulous views of the city, and beyond.

<Content>Absolutely Faaabulous! To anyone wanting to experience Florence without the noise and heat and traffic - book this hotel. Our stay of only 2 days was superb. The hotel is beautifully restored and tasteful and the staff are extremely helpful without being intrusive. Having stayed in expensive ($500 USD+) hotels in the centre, I would not consider them again as this place is so beautifully private and quiet. To any Aussies - this is the Toorak of Florence!

<Content>OK but not Great Residence Michelangelo certainly looks the part but really fails to deliver on the finer details:Pros:1. Bedrooms are well decorated, spacious and very clean2. Parking on site3. Air conditioning - great in the 40 Degree heat4. QuietCons:1. Breakfast was extremely poor - one of the worst we had in our entire trip - breakfast is placed in a small basket in a kitchenette in your room - it consisted of a long life croissant, long life toasty biscuit, two jams, small cartons of processed fruit juice, processed coffee granules, UHT milk - hardly enough to feed one person let alone two. Very disappointing - meagre and mean in splendid surroundings. What a difference it would have made if they had a breakfast room available with fresh bread, coffee etc - now that would have been value for money.2.Notice in the bedroom telling you that if you wanted your room cleaned on a daily basis it would cost you 鈧?0.00 - ok was very clean but felt a bit mean on top of the meagre breakfast.3. Is a good 20 minute walk to the main sites - not very pleasant in hot summer weather (bus is available nearby but we didn't manage to avail of it so can't comment)I would stay somewhere closer to the main attractions - pay the same money for more amenities and a decent breakfast - would not recommend to friends or family

<Content>Perfect Florentine Hotel A little gem of a hotel in Florence. Set away from the hustle and bustle of the city yet still within walking or a short bus ride away. A perfect way to enjoy the real Florentine style in an old villa with wonderfully spacious air conditioned rooms and set in beautiful gardens. Very friendly owners who are extremely helpful with tourist info etc and you can come and go as you please, even cooking your own meal as each room is equipped with a mini kitchenette There is no worry about rushing down for breakfast as this is provided in your room along with fresh italian coffee. A must for the discerning traveller who wants to see Florence but still appreciates spacious and top quality accommodation.

<Content>Awesome Hotel We stayed at the Residence June 20 to 24, and had a wonderful experience. The hotel is outside the centre but easily accessible. This villa is fantastic, by far the best accomodation we had in our three weeks in Italy. We had a superior room with a kitchenette, and were able to make coffee in the morning. The room was very spacious, with high ceiling, and a window that must have been about 20 feet tall. Extreme care hasbeen given in keeping the integretiy of the building, while having all the modern amenities.The bathroom was large and spotless with an abundance of towels and toiletries.Angela made us feel welcome, and was available for all of our questions. We would highlyrecommend the residenza and look forward to staying there again.

<Content>Great place to stay! What a gem of a place! My husband a I stayed here for 3 nights with our 18 month old and 3 month old sons. We were made feel really welcome, and Angela the owner was very friendly and helpful. The room was spacious for all four of us. We stayed in a superior room as it had a little kitchenette - fridge, 2 ring electric hob, sink, which was ideal for us with two small children. There was a great little deli approx 100metres away which Angela recommended. Bathroom was quiet large - does not have a shower curtain, but could find no fault really with our stay. Big comfortable bed! Free parking within the residence was also a bonus. It took 10-15 mins to walk to Ponte Vecchio which is a pleasant walk along the river. We loved the place and would certainly stay there again if we were to go to Florence.
