<Content>Ok for before and after a cruise We stayed here on the night before we boarded a cruise and the night after and did some sightseeing in San Juan. The Hotel is in a crowded area and was under construction, but the rooms were clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.The breakfast was average. The location was close to a nice public beach and plenty of places to eat.The boxes of tiles stacked in the hallway outside our room indicated that more work was planned, but they were still untouched a week later when we returned. We thought they could be stacked elsewhere.One of the elevators didn't match the level of the floors when it stopped... too high or too low... not consistent.Would not recommend for a long stay but was fine for stop overs.

<Content>Not Very Comfortable Stayed for 2 nights and got a room with two beds. I was traveling with my wife, 2 children and an infant. Check in was pretty easy and they provide me quickly with a crib. Got an interior room with a view to the hallway. There was plenty of space in the room and was very clean. (Might be an idea if you are traveling with a lots of people). Pool was not very kid friendly though. It started out a 5 feet and ended up at 8 feet. Kids couldn't use it. I slept great but my wife found the bed to be to hard and woke up both days with a backache. (She has never complain before). Parking is awlful both on the street and on the hotel property. The hotel has about eight tight parking spaces. Parking is $10.70 (including tax) a night. You may have to leave your key if you end up blocking some other car. The greatest part of the trip was breakfast but that is typical with Choice Hotels.

<Content>Nice, large rooms We had two adults and two grown children. The accomodations worked for us because there were two separate bedrooms that were very large. One of the rooms had two queen beds which is exactly what we needed for our children. The living room was also very large - a sofa and a loveseat. There was also a separate kitchen area that had a pass through to the living room. The kitchen had a full-size refrigerator, sink and a microwave. The negatives were: (1) there was only one bathroom and the only way to access it was to go through our bedroom, and (2) the rooms smelled musty. I don't have a good sense of smell so I couldn't detect the musty smell, but my husband could.I think the place offered very good value for the price. The rooms were very clean and the pool was very nice. The location is conveniently located to shops, the beach and restaurants. We highly recommend the Di Parma Tratorria restaurant at 1049 Ave Ashford. It's outdoor dining at reasonable prices, particularly at lunch time.

<Content>Fair price, decent location Based on a recommendation from a coworker who said it was cheap but clean we stayed at the Comfort Inn for two nights before a recent cruise, and again after the cruise since we weren't flying home until the next day. Our first room was on the 3rd floor and was rather small but it was clean and worked out nicely. The bathroom was too small, and the light switch was outside for some reason. We were pleasantly surprised by the make your own waffles and hard boiled eggs served with the free continental breakfast. It was easy to walk to restaurants, a very nice park on the waterfront, and the bus stop. The bus is only 75 cents to Old San Juan, but taxis to the airport and cruise pier were expensive. There was no shortage of taxis available when we needed one. The front desk staff were helpful, although at times very busy. Our room the weekend after our cruise was located on the first floor. The room and bathroom were both much larger than the room on the 3rd floor but until about 10 PM the lobby and hallway were rather noisy.

<Content>ok for the money! Friendly staff, room clean and comfortable for the money. Most other hotels were well into the 2-3 hundreds. We just wanted to sleep. Pool small, continental breakfast good. It's actually better than the pictures look.

<Content>Worse Comfort Inn I ever stayed at! My party stayed at this Comfort Inn on the 4th night of our 13-day trip. This was our 3rd hotel in Puerto Rico and unfortunately the worse hotel of our entire trip. I did not want to spend alot of money on this particular part of the trip (but I did any way), as we were going to be embarking on our cruise ship the next day. When I began looking to book a hotel, I realized that all hotels within San Juan and the vicinity are very expensive. The Choice Hotel chain should be very embarrassed that this hotel is part of their chain! However, they did provide a decent breakfast. The elevator scared me so I took the stairs, but, the stairs were very unstable. The person who checked me in was dealing with a problem with a guest and kept rolling his eyes as if the guest was expecting too much. Don't know what the conversation was but thought to myself that if I were calling I would not like to be treated like that. The pool was not at all attractive so I skipped that and walked down to the beach which was about 2 blocks away. I could not believe that an additional $10/day charge to park your car in one of their 4 spots was ridiculous. Fortunately, I was on my way to return the car to the rental facillity, therefore eluded the parking fee. There is no scenic view from any room in any direction, just views of dirty alleys and vacant buildings. In summary, if you are looking for just a bed to sleep in overnight, this is the place but expect to pay 3 times more for this budget motel.

<Content>Just what we were looking for We booked this hotel for 2 nights prior to a cruise. Based on reviews here on tripadvisor, we were expecting exactly what we got. The hotel is clean but old. Rooms were large. As we weren't planning on spending a lot of time in the room, we just needed a clean place with a decent bed. That's exactly what we got.Brenda on the front desk was very helpful. Made good recommendations for places to eat and assisted with the airline who had lost some luggage.Good location as the hotel is withing walking distance of beach, shopping and restaurants.Breakfast was typical Comfort Inn fare.

<Content>Not Great - but ok Stayed here 2 nights pre-cruise. Hotel is not in tip-top shape but it's not exactly run-down either. Our room was ok, carpet was somewhat worn, could be re-painted, beds were ok and bathroom was ok. Breakfast was good - ok, well... typical. There was a good selection of restaurants within 2 or 3 blocks. Beach was down a short street (Holiday Inn Express was there) and across a park. Beach was beautiful. Parking at hotel was nearly non-existant - I counted like 12 or 14 spaces! unless they have more parking somewhere else. But that was ok, because we took cabs to and from. There was a pharmacy and C-store nearby and Sunday morning we walked about 4 blocks to a catholic church for mass (in english) before our cruise.Would I recommend or stay again, hmmmm. I'd be tempted to try the Holiday Inn Express across the street (well sort-of) but I've read some not so hot reviews about that one too. So on balance, because this was just a pit-stop, I'd recommend it as such for the budget minded.

<Content>serviceable for a night -- no place for a vacation This is an older property is a reasonable but not great state of repair. It is properly classified as a 2 star hotel. The neighborhood seems safe (parking is tight), and the staff friendly. I arrived late in San Juan and needed a place to sleep for a night before moving on. It worked well for that purpose. I had some Choice Hotel frequent stay points to use, and the property was a good value using those points. I think spending a longer Caribbean vacation here would be a bit depressing.For those who have to pay cash, I would first consider making a priceline bid for a higher class property. If you look at biddingfortravel and betterbidding, you will see that it is often possible to book a better hotel in San Juan for $100 or less using those services. If you can score a room that way, it's probably a better deal than staying at this Comfort Inn.

<Content>Average hotel w/ Small Bathroom I booked this hotel for one overnight stay and had other family members here and at another hotel nearby. I stayed in a room with double beds and a small bathroom. The bathroom was pretty small but compared to another hotel I seen that family stayed in this was like staying in the double tree. Their room was so small you couldn't do anything but laugh when they first opened the door. My niece had to get in the closet to let her husband walk by in the pathway to go the restroom at this other hotel. So yes if your going to stay this is a decent hotel near the shuttle that will take you into the downtown section of San Juan. The lobby only had one person working and they took forever to check people out which created a line. This hotel also does continental breakfast. The computer that has internet does not have a printer hooked up to it.

<Content>Average Stayed overnite before a cruise. Upon arrival there is a definite musty odor in the reception area that carried over to the room. Our travelling companions slept the night with their window open and the air conditioning off to avoid the dankness but only managed to be warm. Their toilet stopped up during the night, not at our friends' fault. It was cheerfully fixed in the morning but needless to say detracted from the experience. There was no adjustment offered. The best part was the staff who were quite pleasant and responsive throughout our visit. Breakfast was continental, not full. If we were to repeat we would have booked through Princess line at the Sheration. We were told by a fellow cruiser that she had obtained a large room with balcony with transfer from the airport and transfer to the ship for $169 all in. I paid $142 (with tax) for the Comfort Inn room (there is a lot of tax) and another $20+ for our share of cabs and got considerably less in comfort and convenience. We had lunch at the Sheraton on the way home and it was beautiful and would have been vastly more convenient, particularly for access to Old San Juan and of course, the ship..

<Content>Disappointed after reading other reviews -- dirty room, poor service We booked this hotel after reading the other Tripadvisor reviews, but were majorly disappointed once we arrived. First off, there was no one at reception when we arrived and my husband had to walk around the hotel before finding a staff member. Second, our room was stuffy and smelled like no one had opened the windows for a while; there were large patches of black mold growing in two different areas on the ceiling; and the rug was dirty and had paint chips all over it (probably from decaying paint that had fallen from the ceiling). Third, we had a rental car with us and their parking system was inane -- the gates are not automatic and are raised only when the receptionist happens to see your car in her security monitor. One time, we said bye to the receptionist, who knew we had a car parked there, and she didn't bother raising the gate for us. That meant walking back in and telling her to raise the gate. This receptionist was also extremely surly and gave us commands accompanied by cold looks, rather than talking to us like a regular human being. Their complimentary breakfast was okay and the water pressure in the shower was good...those are the only somewhat-positive things I can think of about this place. I'd rather spend the extra $50 next time and stay at the Holiday Inn Express, which is right next door and looked ten times better.

<Content>Very Nice We were surprised by how nice this Comfort Inn was. Very conveniently situated in the Condado district, within walking distance of some good restaurants. The room was fine - large enough and clean. The bathroom was certainly adequate for 3 nights stay. Top marks to Juan on Reception who was not only pleasant and friendly, but also knowledgeable about San Juan. We asked plenty of questions and he always knew the answer!We did not hire a car until we left San Juan, but there appeared to be adequate off street parking right in front of the hotel and a taxi rank just outside. I would definitely stay there again without a second thought.

<Content>My new S.J. HQ! Based on reviews here i took a chance after a bad stay in another hotel last time and was i ever happy. Greatlocation for shopping and restaurants in Condado and very close to cruise ship piers. A/C was great, my 6th floor room had a partial view of the ocean, and best of all its not directly on Ashford Ave. which is VERY noisy. Great staff tooOnly downside is the pool is in a tight little spot and gets very hot but the beach is just a block away!Will return again.

<Content>Good location and price We stayed in a suite which consisted of 2 bedrooms with a living room in between. One bedroom was next to the kitchenette and bathroom and had 1 queen bed. The other bedroom had 2 queen beds. The rooms were clean--but dark---windows faced other hotels. The living room coffee table was too large for the room and was glass--so we had to be very careful when walking by with our luggage. The breakfast was nice--plenty of food and drink--but the room was very small. It was hard to get to the food as the tables were very close. The desk clerk in the morning locked up our luggage so we could explore before getting on our ship after lunch. We walked down to Tony Roma's for dinner---did not feel unsafe, but did see three police officers on our way. We did not see the pool. This hotel is nice enough--and the price is right. We would stay here again.

<Content>Perfect Location !! Great Staff !! We were worried about the hotel prior to arrival as its a one star. The price was a bit HIGH for a one star $156 w/taxes ... but we found out there was some big tournament in town and thats why the rooms were all sold out and such high prices. Saying that, we were extremely pleased with the hotel. We only stayed for one night prior to our cruise but the location was absolutely fantastic! We walked to everything ... restaurants, casinos, beach. The hotel staff gave us great advice - such as take the bus downtown (just across the street) for $0.75 and where to have dinner for the most awesome authentic Puertican Cuisine - Angels Cafe - it was SO GREAT we were sorry we only got to have one meal there! The morning of our cruise - the staff person at the desk was extremely helpful  thorough in explaining what we should do with our luggage etc. and how to check in at Carnival Cruise Terminal. The breakfast was really fair also - nice hb eggs and toast - just what we needed to get going. The internet terminals they had were inexpensive and convenient. The pool was really cute for a quick dip. All said, this hotel turned out to be a great find for us and should we ever need another night pre-cruise - we would definately choose it again!

<Content>Good location for Precruise stay We stayed at the Comfort Inn for one night prior to our cruise. We found it to be clean, the staff friendly, and the location perfect. You could walk to great shopping, restaurants, and a beautiful beach. Though we arrived late (after 10pm) we were able to find some great local food and beer within a 5 minute walk. The room was well equipped, clean and large. Were easily able to secure a cab ride to the ship the next morning, but not before enjoying a run on the beach, breakfast, and shopping at Louis Vuitton...For the price and lenght of stay, it exceeded our expectations. If we need a precruise stay again in SJ, we would use the Comfort Inn again.

<Content>Just Fine Just got back from a short trip to San Juan. I read many reviews of hotels in the area and decided on Comfort Inn based on those reviews. I was not disappointed. The taxi ride from the airport was a little hairy, but we survived. Polite staff at the counter greeted us. Our room was clean and the price was right. Nothing special, but nice enough. We paid $127 for one night. A short walk to a small plaza and beach area. Safe and very clean area to walk around. Police are seen all over. Restaurants within walking distance. We took the bus (B21) to Old San Juan, the bus stop is just a few blocks away.Our cruise did not leave until later the next day and check out in noon, but Brenda locked our luggage (and several other travelor's luggage) up in a small room off the front desk so we could tour around Old San Juan without it.

<Content>Comfort in San Juan The staff at this hotel are the greatest! We arrived well before our check-in time, group of 8, and Juan gave us a big ground floor room right away, we could all stow our luggage and get out to look around.The rooms were clean and comfortable.We had an early flight the next day and they opened the breakfast room early so we could eat before we left.Every staff member we dealt with went above and beyond to help us with any arrangements, even booking our cabs to the airport.The hotel is also in close proximity to the beach and lots of restaurants.

<Content>Convenient location, free waffles for breakfast, safe area Stayed only 1 night, Dec 26, 2006.Great free breakfast. It's make your own waffles. Pour the batter into the waffle iron and cook your own.They have a huge selection of boxed cereals like Raisin Bran, Rice Krispies. Milk, orange juice, bananas. The Hot water in the shower is backwards and takes a long time to heat up. I called the front desk because I didn't think the hot water was working. The location is close to everything--Walgreens, Wendy's burgers.Its not beachfront, but the beach is only about 1 block away.

<Content>Nice hotel, near beach Stayed for 5 nights at the Comfort Inn over Thanksgiving. Nice hotel, clean, big room (asked for a room with a king bed on the upper floors [ours was on the 5th flor]), view was Ok... could see a tiny bit of the ocean. Breakfast buffet was a little meager, but ok... basically tea/coffee, some fruit (bananas, apples, oranges), cereal and bread. Be prepared to wait a while for the (one) slow toaster or the even slower waffle maker. The hotel is 3 minutes from the very nice beach in Condado. We could walk to the beach in our bathing suits and that was nice! Beach was never crowded. Hotel is not as close to old San Juan as it sounds in the description... You will need to take a bus, which takes about 10 minutes, but buses run every 20-30 minutes until 9pm. They are a little less frequent on weekends. Many restaurants nearby. Definitely try Ajili-Mojili or Ropa Vieja for a splurge but good dinner or Cafe del Angel for a cheaper but decent meal. Staff members at the hotel are very friendly. Avis rent-a car is just down the street. We will definitely go back to stay there again.

<Content>The Comfort Inn is Fine First, let me say that I read every review of every hotel in Puerto Rico (even for Culebra and Vieques). I went to PR for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. I wound up staying in a vacation home in Coco Beach. I was right next door to Paradisus, which is too far from San Juan for me. Over the four days that I was there I checked out the areas of San Juan that are very popular. This is my take: Old San Juan is beautiful, but too congested for me to stay in a hotel in that area. Isla Verde was beautiful but had a very old feeling to it and is way overpriced and also out of the way. The Condado was the hippest most laid back, comfortable place for my tastes. Good food, good shopping, good beach. I stayed my last night at the Comfort Inn and I must have had a renovated room because I loved my room. It was a very large room with a couch and a desk and chair. The pool was okay and the breakfast was not really that but the hotel was reasonably priced and the location was great with everything in walking distance; Cartier, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Dunkin Donuts, Wendys, Starbucks, Walgreens, Ajili-Mojili, beach, bridge to Old San Juan. I loved it!!

<Content>What a dump! We booked a two night stay at the Comfort Inn Condado, PR (San Juan). The hotel is pictured in the Puerto Rico Tourism Magazine Que Pasa! and appeared to be a no frills hotel but clean and presentable. When we stepped into the lobby, the smell almost took your breath away. The lobby was dreary and dirty. We had booked three rooms and the unfamiliarity of San Juan pushed us through the motions of registering. Two of the rooms smelled even worse than the lobby. The third room had the doors standing wide open and looked as if a party had just ended. Two doors down from the hotel clerk and they had no clue... As we all drifted back to the lobby in disbelief, I spotted a Holiday Inn Express across the street. What a refreshing sight. I went there and secured three wonderful rooms for only $20 more per room (non-internet prices). I called my family and directed them to return the room keys and cancel our rooms. To the Comfort Inn's credit, they did not agrue at all. All cancellations were quickly terminated.

<Content>Good Value Stayed for 3 days, 2 nights before a cruise. Nicely accommodated our group of 26. The handicap access room adjoining the pool was perfect for one family with a handicapped child. The rooms were clean, the front desk personnel were very pleasant and knowledgeable, and the location was perfect. The beach was a short walk across the street. Many restaurants nearby. The breakfast was meager - saved money and splurged on dinner. Didn't look like much from the outside but the rooms and price were just what we were looking for. Would recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive short stay.

<Content>Disgusting I stayed at this hotel on new years, because i needed a cheap place to sleep for a few hours after going out in san juan. the room smelled so bad, i could hardly sleep even for a few hours. at one point i borrowed some air freshner from the cleaning lady and sprayed the room. Condado is a really hot area. right down the street there is a cartier, fendi and christian dior right down the street. so if you are willing to put up with the rancid stench of this hotel, then stay here.

<Content>Great Budget Hotel Mar-26-2006 Hi, my name is Desiree (42yrs old) living in Queens, NY I just got back from San Juan, me and my boyfriend stayed at the Comfort Inn, it is a great, wonderful, clean Budget hotel, very convient to many places, restruants, casinos, running trackin to park area, (just follow path straight across bridge) close to the B21 bus which is the bus that gets you around San Juan and old San Juan for just .75cents, runs every 30 minutes, there's a big shopping mall, lots to see and do, Juan whom is at the front desk is great, and very helpful for questions and information. We arrived earlier than check in time, but good old Juan found an great room, for 2, non-smoking, a/c, bathroom, safe in room, and the hotel and rooms, are clean. I said rooms because I stayed here 3 days before my cruise and 1 day after (rooms 301  405).The cab fare from the airport to the hotel is $12 to 15 dollars, use the taxi services outside, (where a taxi repre will give you a receipt ticket to wait for the next available white van/car cab. They will take you exactly where the ticket says. This hotel is the greatest if you are going on a Cruise because it is very close to the port 10 to 12 mintues, taxi cost $12 to $15 dollars, you can (if you are travelling not to heavy) take to B21 bus (.75cents) to the port which is the last stop in old San Juan.and get off at terminal and walk to which port your ship. The hotel also has a breadfast room which is located in the back of the hotel by the pool area, there's an Ice machine, soda machine. The breadfast consists of continetal style, toast, cearl , juices, jelly, butter, a TV to watch while you eat and most important again very clean area. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There are 2 elevators by the reception area. There's a luggae wheel carrier. The time is 1 hours ahead of us (well people in NY anyway)the area is very safe, and no one bothers you, I went jogging by myself at 5:45am so thats how safe I felt. They're police driving by at least every 7 minutes. The Comfort Inn is very excellent choice for stay and we would always come back to stay. again and again.

<Content>Good deal for area This was my second stay at the Comfort Inn in San Juan in four years. As before, the price ($80 +tax) is a fantastic value for Condado. $10 extra per day for parking. As others have pointed out, the continental breakfast is below the standard of a mainland Comfort Inn. There are two types of dry cereal, various packets of oatmeal, and Wonderbread for toast. That's it. I think they could definitely do better on the breakfast, but I would stay here again.

<Content>! This hotel, as well as the neighboring Holiday Inn Express, are both terrific value for money. I stayed here three nights in March, for $80+tax per night for a king room! The hotel staff was professional and helpful, there is wireless Internet in the rooms, the windows can be opened (hooray!) so turn off the AC and enjoy the cool night breeze while sleeping. This is by no means a fancy place but you cannot beat the price, so this is where you stay when you want to do the Caribbean on a budget without compromising on essential quality. The swimmable beach next to the Condado Plaza Hotel is a few minutes walk away, as are excellent restaurants and the bus line to Old San Juan. My ONLY complaint about this hotel is the lack of a coffee maker (bring your own, I guess!). The breakfast is really sparse but really, for 80$ this is such a steal it would be mean to complain about that...

<Content>Stayed one night My husband and I stayed here one night before our cruise left the next day. This hotel is fine for a short stay. There is a bus stop one block away which goes into Old San Juan which was very convenient. Also it was very easy to share a cab with people going to the pier the next morning the cruise left.Our room was clean, smelled a little musty, but overall adequate for one nite for approx $100.If you want to stay as close as possible to the pier, there was a Sheraton right across the street from the pier. Not sure what their rates were. I had difficulty finding a hotel which would allow us only to book one night, so the comfort inn worked out.

<Content>Nice place to stay We stayed at the Comfort Inn before our cruise. I have had bad experiences in the past of booking rooms for our group over the internet only to get there and find that they were nothing like their pictures and descriptions. The Comfort Inn in San Juan was different. It was nicer than the pictures and every bit as pleasant as was expected. We arrived very late in the evening and the clerk was very helpful and friendly. A few of my group felt like a drink after a long day of flying and the bar stayed open for us.The rooms were clean and comfortable. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Just what we needed! I was booked to stay at El Canario By The Lagoon which is just next door to the Comfort Inn. I chose El Canario on a recommendation from a friend and because I was assured by the reservationist that the hotel offered internet access in the room which was a necessity for me.After checking in to El Canario and discovering that they did not offer this, I walked next door to the Comfort Inn and was right away greeted with a welcoming smile from the staff behind the desk. They promptly showed me a suite on the 7th floor which was totally suitable for my family and me (it even had a walk in closet!). We moved in right away and spent a very enjoyable 5 days there. I was able to check my emails regularly and was always greeted with a smiling face whenever I passed the desk.Finding this place was a Godsend - it totally suited our needs. Yes the breakfast was not what we expected and we only had it once but our room had a fridge and a microwave and we promptly walked to the 24 hour Walgreens (only 5 mins walk away) and stocked up on groceries to use in the room.We did have one or two problems with the room but as soon as I reported them someone came up to fix them.I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Value in The Condado If you are looking for a modest pricetag and don't insist on having the beach at your doorstep - this could be your ticket. The hotel is on a quiet side street about a block south of main-drag Ashford Avenue. The west end of Condado Beach begins at a charming little plaza that is about a 2 minute walk. There is a bus stop a short distance away, which gives you easy access to Old San Juan and everywhere else. The neighborhood has abundant restaurants, a number of bars, some shopping (Cartier on the corner!), a couple of local convenience stores, and a 24-hour Walgreens Drug/Grocery is just a few blocks. The hotel has a very nice little bar, though its hours of operation are a bit unpredictable. Housekeeping was impeccable during my 7-day stay in early December 2005. The room, while comfortable, was generic American hotel chain. With the drapes closed you might as well be in Omaha. Lots of cable TV channels, both English and Spanish (you're in a tropical paradise-why are you in your room watching TV??) Very sparse continental breakfast. Coffee, juice, milk, hot/cold cereal, toast. Period. Oh, well. Wendy's on Ashford is open for breakfast. Will I stay at the Comfort again? Most likely. [Tip: best rate I found was on their own website: --- and they allow you to cancel with no penalty as late as 2 days before scheduled arrival.]

<Content>Better hotels to stay in Condado my husband, daughter  I stayed 2 nights, rooms were small, beds were small % not very comfortable,Also had to pay parking fee $10.00 for the so called parking lot?!!? if you can even callit a parking lot was sooooooooo small, it really sucks that visitors are paying good money and this hotel charges parking!!! when I booked I asked for a SMOKING roon was told okay, upon arriving was told hotel is none smoking, we were on the 2nd floor and there kids running and screaming in the hallways at all hours, not a good place to stay with small kids as the pool is NOT KID friendly (no shallow end), also no outside play areas. We were in Puerto Rico for two weeks and theses were our last 2 nights on the island, what a disappointment and very unfullfilling end to what other wise was a great vacation, My husband and I visit the island every year for our vacation and tour the whole island and have stayed at dozens of variuos hotels, paradors, guest houses and this one is at the bottom of the list. one good thing about this hotel was a staff personnel by the name of Brenda Rosario. she was warm, friendly and very helpful with my compaints, the morning we checked out (8/14/05) the guy behind the desk didn't even thank us or anything, which I found very rude. Believe me I would never, ever stay here again, even if I was offered free lifetime stays or paid to stay here. Close to Ashford St, which has really gotten over-priced, very few good places left to shop and eat at (especially if your on a budget).

<Content>Great staff! I was stranded in San Juan after missing my flight back home, and the people at this Comfort Inn were so hospitable! Big thanks out to them, and we will definitely stay there again if I make it back to San Juan.

<Content>Smart Choice The Comfort Inn in the Condado area is a cost-effective choice. It is clean, comfortable and convenient to San Juan's attractions, dining and public transportation. My wife and I ( both senior citizens ) enjoyed our stay andtouring the area. Management is helpful, friendly and most courteous. Prices are very reasonable.

<Content>Great Pre-Cruise Stay!!! We stayed at the Comfort Inn for one night before boarding our cruise ship. We were nervous at first since the taxi drove through some rough neighborhoods, but the hotel was nice once we got there. It is very dated but incredibly clean. We got a fantastic internet only price of $89 per night which couldn't be beat. It's also located about a block from Ashford which has shops and food.......the beach is about 2-3 blocks away.Overall I'd definitely recommend it for a pre-cruise stay or for budget minded travelers.

<Content>Convenient to cruise docks I was looking for a place to stay over night before our cruise that would be convenient to the cruise docks and found the Comfort Inn. Hotel is not very attractive from outside, but small lobby is quite nice. Very close proximity to restaurants, other hotels and shops and beach -- an easy walk. Our room was small, but clean and adequate. Although area around pool is fairly small, pool and surrounding area is sparkling clean -- a nice quiet area to relax after a long flight! Breakfast very basic, but adequate. Hotel personnel are helpful and friendly. So if you are just looking for a short stay, it is a good value for the money; but wouldn't recommend for a week's vacation in Puerto Rico.

<Content>Def come back here again! I stayed at the Comfort Inn back in June, 2004 and had the greatest experience. The staff was wonderful, helpful and polite! Place was extremely clean and I loved the view in my room on the 5th Flr! Everything worked and everything was spotless; pool was clean and I will so come back to hotel again! And you can't beat the price either! Simply a great choice for me, a female traveling alone!

<Content>Would stay again We stayed at the Comfort Inn in the Condado area for four nights and would recommend it to anyone who is on a budget and wants to be in San Juan downtown area. Our room was small but very clean and quiet. Shower had good pressure and water was hot. The beds, though small for two adults, were firm. The staff was generally helpful and pleasant. The area the hotel is located is quite congested and driving in San Juan could be hazardous to your health if you are not very careful. There is a very nice seafood restaurant within walking distance--the Miro Marisqueria Catalana on Condado Street. We would return to this hotel if we were going to be in downtown San Juan again.

<Content>GOOD DEAL FOR THE PRICE Stayed there 2 days pre-cruise and had a wonderful time. Room was clean and fairly large, staff was friendly especially Juan! Breakfast was so-so but it did it's job. They were able to arrange day trips at the hotel that would pick you up at the front of the hotel. This made it very convient. The hotel is also close to the bus stop which will only cost you 25 cents...a great way to get around San Juan on the cheap. Also several little convience stores within easy walking distance... Rick Steves would be proud! If your staying longer than a couple days, I would spend a few extra bucks and get a hotel on the beach, although this one is only a couple blocks from one. All in all a very nice tourist class hotel.

<Content>Try the Holiday Inn Express next door instead We had a marvelous vacation and so enjoyed the Condada area and its convienience - that said - The Comfort Inn was the not good. We would not sttay in it again. Dirty foyer - our bed sagged deeply in the middle - bedding was old - could never get the right fash cloths or towels - dusty - do NOT plan on eating their breakfast! I am sure noone who worked there would eat it. The coffee was so bad - thin slices of white bread with a toaster - no condiments - pkgs of instant oatmeal and orange juice and milk. They also had a glass canister with a few cups of corn flakes in and a scoop - all smashed and would not tempt the birds. For a better stay try the Holiday Inn Express across the street from the Comfort Inn or spring for the Marriott in Condada - that is where we hung out.

<Content>Nice small hotel We stayed one night pre-cruise, hotel was clean, a little worn, but quite. Located within walking distance to a nice waterfront park and plenty of restaurants. Requested non-smoking but room had an ashtray but did not smell smokey. Rooms are small but adequate. Breakfast was pretty sparse, but overall we were happy with this hotel for the money we paid.
